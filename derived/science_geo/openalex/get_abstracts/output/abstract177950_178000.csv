https://openalex.org/W2171280873,"Clonal populations of cells exhibit substantial phenotypic variation. Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation."

Although ubiquitin is recycled from proteasome substrates, the molecular basis of deubiquitination at the proteasome and its relation to substrate degradation remain unknown. The Rpn11 subunit of the proteasome lid subcomplex contains a highly conserved Jab1/MPN domain–associated metalloisopeptidase (JAMM) motif—EX n HXHX 10 D. Mutation of the predicted active-site histidines to alanine ( rpn11AXA ) was lethal and stabilized ubiquitin pathway substrates in yeast. Rpn11 AXA mutant proteasomes assembled normally but failed to either deubiquitinate or degrade ubiquitinated Sic1 in vitro. Our findings reveal an unexpected coupling between substrate deubiquitination and degradation and suggest a unifying rationale for the presence of the lid in eukaryotic proteasomes."
https://openalex.org/W1619234695,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and stroke. However, the mechanism of MMP activation remains unclear. We report that MMP activation involves S-nitrosylation. During cerebral ischemia in vivo, MMP-9 colocalized with neuronal nitric oxide synthase. S-Nitrosylation activated MMP-9 in vitro and induced neuronal apoptosis. Mass spectrometry identified the active derivative of MMP-9, both in vitro and in vivo, as a stable sulfinic or sulfonic acid, whose formation was triggered by S-nitrosylation. These findings suggest a potential extracellular proteolysis pathway to neuronal cell death in which S-nitrosylation activates MMPs, and further oxidation results in a stable posttranslational modification with pathological activity."

Because nanometer-sized metal particles do not optically bleach, they may be useful optical labels if suitable detection signals can be found. We demonstrate far-field optical detection of gold colloids down to diameters of 2.5 nanometers with a photothermal method that combines high-frequency modulation and polarization interference contrast. The photothermal image is immune to the effects of scattering background, which limits particle imaging through Rayleigh scattering to diameters larger than 40 nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W2013057562,"COP9 signalosome (CSN) cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 from the Cul1 subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligases. The Jab1/MPN domain metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif in the Jab1/Csn5 subunit was found to underlie CSN's Nedd8 isopeptidase activity. JAMM is found in proteins from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, including the Rpn11 subunit of the 26S proteasome. Metal chelators and point mutations within JAMM abolished CSN-dependent cleavage of Nedd8 from Cul1, yet had little effect on CSN complex assembly. Optimal SCF activity in yeast and both viability and proper photoreceptor cell (R cell) development in Drosophila melanogaster required an intact Csn5 JAMM domain. We propose that JAMM isopeptidases play important roles in a variety of physiological pathways."

These splay faults branch upward from the plate-boundary interface (that is, the subduction zone) at a depth of ∼10 kilometers, ∼50 to 55 kilometers landward of the trough axis, breaking through the upper crustal plate. Slip on the active splay fault may be an important mechanism that accommodates the elastic strain caused by relative plate motion."
https://openalex.org/W2115956404,"Transient interactions of platelet-receptor glycoprotein Ibalpha (GpIbalpha) and the plasma protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) reduce platelet velocity at sites of vascular damage and play a role in haemostasis and thrombosis. Here we present structures of the GpIbalpha amino-terminal domain and its complex with the VWF domain A1. In the complex, GpIbalpha wraps around one side of A1, providing two contact areas bridged by an area of solvated charge interaction. The structures explain the effects of gain-of-function mutations related to bleeding disorders and provide a model for shear-induced activation. These detailed insights into the initial interactions in platelet adhesion are relevant to the development of antithrombotic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W1978159348,"According to the ""public information"" hypothesis, some animal species may monitor the current reproductive success of conspecifics to assess local habitat quality and to choose their own subsequent breeding site. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we manipulated two components of public information, the mean number of offspring raised locally (""quantity"") and their condition (""quality""), in the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. Immigration rate decreased with local offspring quantity but did not depend on local offspring quality, suggesting that immigrants are deprived of information regarding local quality. Conversely, emigration rate increased both when local offspring quantity or quality decreased, suggesting that residents can use both components of public information."
https://openalex.org/W1660040913,"In striated muscle, the plasma membrane forms tubular invaginations (transverse tubules or T-tubules) that function in depolarization-contraction coupling. Caveolin-3 and amphiphysin were implicated in their biogenesis. Amphiphysin isoforms have a putative role in membrane deformation at endocytic sites. An isoform of amphiphysin 2 concentrated at T-tubules induced tubular plasma membrane invaginations when expressed in nonmuscle cells. This property required exon 10, a phosphoinositide-binding module. In developing myotubes, amphiphysin 2 and caveolin-3 segregated in tubular and vesicular portions of the T-tubule system, respectively. These findings support a role of the bilayer-deforming properties of amphiphysin at T-tubules and, more generally, a physiological role of amphiphysin in membrane deformation."
https://openalex.org/W2153554955,"The enediynes exemplify nature's ingenuity. We have cloned and characterized the biosynthetic locus coding for perhaps the most notorious member of the nonchromoprotein enediyne family, calicheamicin. This gene cluster contains an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) that is demonstrated to be essential for enediyne biosynthesis. Comparison of the calicheamicin locus with the locus encoding the chromoprotein enediyne C-1027 reveals that the enediyne PKS is highly conserved among these distinct enediyne families. Contrary to previous hypotheses, this suggests that the chromoprotein and nonchromoprotein enediynes are generated by similar biosynthetic pathways."

Cloning and characterization of the 85-kilobase C-1027 biosynthesis gene cluster from Streptomyces globisporus revealed (i) an iterative type I polyketide synthase that is distinct from any bacterial polyketide synthases known to date, (ii) a general polyketide pathway for the biosynthesis of both the 9- and 10-membered enediyne antibiotics, and (iii) a convergent biosynthetic strategy for the C-1027 chromophore from four building blocks. Manipulation of genes governing C-1027 biosynthesis allowed us to produce an enediyne compound in a predicted manner."
https://openalex.org/W1963700437,"Signaling through receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) is essential for the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts, the cell principally responsible for bone resorption. Animals genetically deficient in RANK or the cognate RANK ligand are profoundly osteopetrotic because of the lack of bone resorption and remodeling. RANK provokes biochemical signaling via the recruitment of intracellular tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) after ligand binding and receptor oligomerization. To understand the RANK-mediated signal transduction mechanism in osteoclastogenesis, we have designed a system to recapitulate osteoclast differentiation and activation in vitro by transfer of the RANK cDNA into hematopoietic precursors genetically deficient in RANK. Gene transfer of RANK constructs that are selectively incapable of binding different TRAF proteins revealed that TRAF pathways downstream of RANK that affect osteoclast differentiation are functionally redundant. In contrast, the interaction of RANK with TRAF6 is absolutely required for the proper formation of cytoskeletal structures and functional resorptive activity of osteoclasts. Moreover, signaling via the interleukin-1 receptor, which also utilizes TRAF6, rescues the osteoclast activation defects observed in the absence of RANK/TRAF6 interactions.

The structural and metabolic integrity of bone is maintained through the dynamic process of bone remodeling that results from the coordinate action of bone resorption by osteoclasts and the formation of new bone by osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are large, multinuclear cells that develop from a hematopoietic progenitor and are highly specialized for the resorptive process (1Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 2889: 1504-1508Crossref Scopus (2967) Google Scholar).

It is now widely accepted that most osteotropic agents including IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17, TNF-α, prostaglandin E2, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (5Hofbauer L.C. Dunstan C.R.

RANKL affects bone resorption and bone density by influencing the osteoclast population at multiple stages. Not only does RANKL drive the differentiation of osteoclasts from multipotential progenitors, thereby expanding the pool of osteoclasts available for bone resorption (6Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N.

An essential role for the RANKL receptor, RANK, in osteoclast differentiation in vivo is demonstrated by the lack of osteoclasts and resulting osteopetrosis in RANK−/− animals (10Dougall W.C.

Thus, RANK plays a key role in bone metabolism as the critical signaling receptor responsible for osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival. RANK, like many of the TNFR family proteins, transmits biochemical signals after recruitment of intracellular adaptor TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins. Activation of NF-κB, JNK, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways by RANK occurs via TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 (reviewed in Ref. 12Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The relevance of each of these biochemical signals in osteoclast biology is underscored by the osteopetrotic phenotypes of the p50/p52 NF-κB double knockout mouse (13Franzoso G. Carlson L. Xing L.

Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar), as well as the inhibition ofin vitro osteoclast differentiation after blockade of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (16Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). TRAF6, which binds to a RANK structural motif distinct from the region that binds TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5, plays an essential role in RANKL-mediated NF-κB activation in transfected cell systems (17Darnay B.G., Ni, J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34120-34127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). TRAF6 also provides a functional connection between RANK signaling and the activation of c-Src kinase, Akt/protein kinase B, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (19Wong B.R. Kim N. Arron J.R.

RANK signaling is essential for the initiation of osteoclast differentiation. However, transfection studies in heterologous cells have demonstrated that RANK signal transduction is mediated via multiple distinct and selective TRAF-binding motifs (reviewed in Ref.12Inoue J. Ishida T. Tsukamoto N. Kobayashi N. Naito A. Azuma S. Yamamoto T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To define the relevance of these distinct RANK cytoplasmic motifs and downstream biochemical pathways in the context of each stage of osteoclast differentiation and function, we have established an experimental system in which transfer of the RANK gene into RANK−/− hematopoietic precursors will restore the formation and activation of osteoclasts. Using a panel of RANK mutants selectively incapable of binding distinct TRAF proteins, we have established that there are redundant RANK signaling paths necessary for the differentiation of hematopoietic precursors into multinuclear osteoclasts and for the up-regulation of genes which function during osteoclastogenesis. In contrast to RANK-dependent differentiation signals, the sequence elements in the RANK cytoplasmic domain necessary for TRAF6 binding are nonredundant and critical for the proper cytoskeletal organization and resorptive activities of osteoclasts. Each of the human RANK cDNA constructs has been previously described (18Galibert L. Tometsko M.E. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol.

Full-length and mutated human RANK constructs were subcloned into the LZRS-pBMNZ vector (22Kinsella T.M. N. G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), and production of infectious retroviral vector particles was performed in 293-E Phoenix packaging cells as described. Normalized expression of each of the RANK constructs was confirmed by analysis of RANK surface expression using an antibody against human RANK (monoclonal antibody M330) (23Anderson D.M.

NIH3T3 cells were infected with varying amounts of each RANK retroviral construct in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were lifted with Versene and stained with an antibody to hRANK (2.5 μg/ml), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 secondary (1:500) and positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The generation of the RANK−/− mice has been described previously (10Dougall W.C. Glaccum M. Charrier K. Rohrbach K. Brasel K., De Smedt T. Daro E. Smith J. Tometsko M.E. Maliszewski C.R. Armstrong A.

Spleen cells were isolated from 3–6-week-old RANK−/− mice, and T cells, erythroid cells, and neutrophils were depleted using rat antibodies against CD3, Ter-119, and GR-1 (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) and sheep anti-rat conjugated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M-450; Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Cells were incubated for 48 h in 40 ng/ml hCSF-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and infected using retroviral supernatants (multiplicity of infection of 5) in the presence of recombinant fibronectin fragments (Retronectin, PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) for 48 h in 40 ng/ml CSF-1. Following infection, spleen cells were harvested and plated in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum containing 40 ng/ml CSF-1 and the presence or absence of 200 ng/ml mRANKL as indicated. Recombinant murine RANKL is an N-terminal fusion of a leucine zipper trimerization domain (24Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) with residues 134–316 of murine RANKL (23Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R.

Calcitonin binding was performed by blocking cells in 5% nonfat dry milk followed by incubation with 1 μCi/ml 125I-labeled salmon calcitonin (Amersham Biosciences; specific activity = 2000 Ci/mmol). After cells were washed and solubilized in 0.5 mNaOH, total bound counts measured using a γ counter. The specificity of the calcitonin radioligand binding assay was determined by competition of the signal using 100× molar excess of unlabeled salmon calcitonin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Resorption of the CaPO4 matrix (BioCoatTMOsteologicTM discs; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) was measured after treatment of slides in bleach and staining with 0.5% alizarin red. Quantitation of the resorbed area was performed by measuring the surface area of cleared CaPO4 resorption pits using Image Pro Plus 4.1 software from Media Cybernetics (Silver Spring, MD). Values are expressed as relative resorbed area in percentages compared with that measured in cells transduced with full-length hRANK and treated with RANKL and were measured from wells in triplicate for each experiment and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. For the pit formation/resorption lacunae assay, transduced cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum containing 40 ng/ml CSF-1 and with either RANKL (200 ng/ml), IL-1β (20 ng/ml), or a combination of RANKL and IL-1β. After culture for a period of 7 days, cells were stained for TRAP and removed from the dentin slices, and the resorption pits were visualized by staining with 1% toluidine blue. RNA was isolated from infected splenic cultures 24, 48, 72, and 120 h after retroviral infection. Treatment of cultures with RANKL was begun at the 48-h time point after the initiation of retroviral infection. cDNA corresponding to 10 ng of total RNA was used per reaction in quantitative PCR performed on a GeneAmp 9600 thermocycler in the presence of the dye SYBR Green, and analyzed by the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). We used primers corresponding to cathepsin K, TRAP, OC-116kDa, c-Src, MMP-9, HPRT, carbonic anhydrase II, calcitonin receptor, hRANK, and CD61; the correct sequence of the reaction products was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All samples were normalized for equivalent cDNA amounts using the HPRT signal. Cells were cultured on coverslip-thick microscope slides. After incubation for 5 days, the medium was aspirated and cells were washed twice in PBS and then fixed in a solution of 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by quenching in 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were blocked using 5% normal goat sera in PBS. Cells were then incubated with antibodies against human RANK (M330), mouse CD61/β3 integrin (clone 2C9.G2; BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies. Alternatively, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% normal goat sera in PBS and incubated with antibodies against hRANK, c-Src (M327v-Src, Ab-1; Calbiochem), c-Cbl (clone C-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies. For visualization of the F-actin, cells were permeabilized as above and then incubated with fluorescently conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:100. To visualize nuclei, cells were permeabilized as described in the presence of RNase A at 100 μg/ml and incubated with Sytox (Molecular Probes) at 1:20,000 in 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. The complete absence of osteoclasts and resulting osteopetrotic phenotype of the RANK knockout mice revealed an obligate role for RANK in normal bone remodeling (10Dougall W.C. Glaccum M. Charrier K.

The C-terminal 72 amino acids of the human RANK cytoplasmic domain are capable of binding to multiple TRAFs (TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5) and transmit signaling through NF-κB- and JNK-dependent pathways (18Galibert L.

A separate region of the human RANK sequence (amino acids 340–421) mediates direct binding to TRAF6 only and is both necessary and sufficient for NF-κB activation in transfected 293 cells (17Darnay B.G., Ni, J. Moore P.A. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7724-7731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 18Galibert L. Tometsko M.E. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J.

To define the functional role of these RANK cytoplasmic domains within the physiological context of the osteoclast, we reconstituted osteoclast differentiation and activation of RANK−/− hematopoietic progenitors using retroviral gene transfer of various human RANK cDNA constructs that selectively lack the ability to bind specific TRAF proteins. We confirmed that infection of fibroblasts with each of the different RANK retroviral supernatants leads to equivalent levels of surface expression (Fig. 1 A). Splenic cells purified from RANK−/− animals and enriched for hematopoietic progenitors cannot form osteoclasts in vitroafter addition of RANKL and CSF-1 (10Dougall W.C. Glaccum M. Charrier K. Rohrbach K. Brasel K., De Smedt T. Daro E. Smith J. Tometsko M.E. Maliszewski C.R. Armstrong A. Shen V. Bain S. Cosman D. Anderson D. Morrissey P.J. Peschon J.J. Schuh J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2412-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) and therefore provide a null background for the osteoclast rescue experiments. These cells were infected with retroviruses encoding the different RANK constructs or a control lacZ virus, and cultured using osteoclastogenic conditions (RANKL + CSF-1, see “Materials and Methods”). Specific expression of the transgenic mRNAs (Fig. 1 B) and total or surface protein level (Fig. 1, C and D) could be detected for each of the RANK constructs only in infected cells. The expression of the full-length RANK transgene mRNA and protein was consistently lower by a factor of 2–2.5-fold relative to the other RANK construct transgenes (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, any deficiency in osteoclast differentiation or function was not caused by lack of expression of the mutated RANK constructs. The formation of differentiated osteoclasts was monitored in situ by expression of the enzyme marker TRAP in multinuclear cells. Osteoclasts failed to form from RANK−/− progenitors that were infected with a control virus encoding lacZ and then cultured with RANKL and CSF-1 (Fig.2). These cells expressed CD11b+, Mac-2+, and F4/80+ (data not shown) consistent with a macrophage phenotype. Retroviral-mediated expression of the full-length human RANK gene efficiently rescued multinuclear TRAP+ osteoclast differentiation even in the absence of exogenously added RANKL (Fig. 2, A andB). Addition of RANKL to the culture clearly increased the size of TRAP+ osteoclasts. RANK constructs lacking the C-terminal TRAF binding domain (RANK Δ545–616 or RANK Δ421–616) also promoted the differentiation of large TRAP+ osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL (Fig. 2,A and B), although to a lesser extent than full-length RANK. The absence of significant numbers of TRAP+ cells without addition of RANKL and the reduced number of multinuclear TRAP+ cells overall suggest that the differentiation signal from these RANK constructs is less potent. Cells transduced with a RANK construct lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain (RANK Δ340–616) were completely incapable of osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 2, A and B). A RANK construct lacking all TRAF binding sites (RANK Δ340–421/Δ545–616) was also completely incapable of forming TRAP+ osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL and CSF-1 (Fig. 2) and was indistinguishable from the C-terminal deletion RANK Δ340–616. To specifically address the role of RANK/TRAF6 signaling in osteoclast differentiation, RANK−/− cells were infected with the RANK Δ340–421 retroviral construct and cultured under the same conditions as described above. TRAP+ osteoclast formation was observed at efficiencies equal to that observed with the C-terminal RANK deletions (Fig. 2 B), although the cells were clearly more compact than, and morphologically distinct from, cells derived from the transduction of wild-type RANK or C-terminal RANK deletions. Higher magnification of these cells revealed that they contained more dendritic or lamellipodia-like processes and were less spread out than TRAP+ osteoclasts derived from the full-length RANK (Figs.5 and 6). Importantly, cells derived from the C-terminal deletion RANK constructs or the internal deletion of the TRAF6 binding site (RANK Δ340–421) were frequently multinuclear (Fig. 2 B). Quantitation of the nuclei in TRAP + osteoclasts transduced and differentiated with the various RANK constructs indicated that there was no significant difference in the mean nuclei number in each case. The reduced efficiencies of TRAP+ osteoclast formation mediated by the different RANK/TRAF-binding mutants indicate that both the RANK C-terminal (TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5) binding element and the membrane-proximal TRAF6 binding element contribute to osteoclast differentiation, but in the absence of either individual TRAF binding site, osteoclast differentiation still proceeds. This compensatory signaling toward osteoclast differentiation is completely abrogated upon removal of all TRAF binding elements. The relative differences in osteoclast differentiation did not vary substantially over several independent viral transductions with the RANK constructs.Figure 6Actin cytoskeleton of osteoclasts after transduction with RANK constructs. RANK−/− cells were infected with each of the RANK retrovirus constructs or a retrovirus encodinglacZ and differentiated in the presence of RANKL and CSF-1 for 5 days. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and processed for F-actin fluorescence using Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin (red) and nuclei were visualized with Sytox (yellow). A, cells differentiated after transduction with the full-length/wild-type (WT) RANK, or either of the C-terminal RANK deletions (RANK Δ545–616 or RANK Δ421–616) exhibited distinct podosome assembly (F-actin rings) in the periphery of most cells. Cells differentiated after transduction with the RANK/TRAF6 binding mutant (RANK Δ340–421) showed a redistribution of the actin to the ends of lamellipodia-like structures. Images were taken with a 20× objective. B, higher magnification (images were taken with a 60× objective) of the F-actin fluorescence in cultures transduced with the controllacZ virus, wild-type RANK, and the RANK/TRAF6 binding mutant (RANK Δ340–421).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to multinuclearity and TRAP staining, we have monitored the expression of multiple mRNAs and proteins expressed specifically during osteoclast differentiation to confirm that cells infected with RANK constructs lacking either the TRAF6 binding site or the separate binding site for TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5 still commit and differentiate into the osteoclast lineage. Expression of the osteoclast marker calcitonin receptor was detected using a radioligand binding assay. We found that expression of the full-length RANK transgene led to specific125I-calcitonin binding that was enhanced further by the addition of RANKL (Fig. 3). The expression of calcitonin receptor was also confirmed in cultures infected with either the C-terminal RANK deletions (RANK Δ545–616 or RANK Δ421–616) or the internal TRAF6 deletion (RANK Δ340–421). However, similar to the reduced efficiency of TRAP positive osteoclast differentiation, these cultures exhibited a reduction in overall125I-calcitonin binding as compared with osteoclasts differentiated via the full-length RANK protein. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of several osteoclast differentiation marker mRNAs (MMP-9, cathepsin K, β3 integrin, carbonic anhydrase II, c-Src, calcitonin receptor, TRAP) demonstrated significant increases of each of these mRNAs in cells cultured in the presence of RANKL after infection with the full-length RANK (Fig.4). In addition, we confirmed protein expression of c-Src (Fig. 5) as well as surface expression of CD61/β3 integrin, a subunit of the vitronectin receptor (data not shown). Osteoclast marker mRNAs were not detected in cells infected with the control lacZ virus or cells infected with the RANK constructs that cannot bind TRAFs (RANK Δ340–421/Δ545–616 and deletion RANK Δ340–616). Similar to the TRAP staining and calcitonin receptor expression, RANK constructs unable to bind TRAF6 (RANK Δ340–421) or TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5 (RANK Δ545–616 or RANK Δ421–616) still promoted osteoclast marker expression but to a lesser degree than the full-length RANK (Fig. 4). These data are consistent with the TRAP/multinuclear osteoclast potential (Fig. 2) and suggest that TRAF/RANK interactions lead to a similar capacity for osteoclast differentiation. The c-Src kinase is highly expressed in osteoclasts and serves as a specific determinant of osteoclast differentiation fro"
https://openalex.org/W2030247233,"Particulate air pollution has been shown to strongly suppress precipitation from convective clouds over land. New observations show that precipitation from similar polluted clouds over oceans is much less affected, because large sea salt nuclei override the precipitation suppression effect of the large number of small pollution nuclei. Raindrops initiated by the sea salt grow by collecting small cloud droplets that form on the pollution particles, thereby cleansing the air. Therefore, sea salt helps cleanse the atmosphere of the air pollution via cloud processes. This implies that over oceans, the climatic aerosol indirect effects are significantly smaller than current estimates."
https://openalex.org/W1986603363,"We report N and He isotopic and relative abundance characteristics of volatiles emitted from two segments of the Central American volcanic arc. In Guatemala, delta15N values are positive (i.e., greater than air) and N2/He ratios are high (up to 25,000). In contrast, Costa Rican N2/He ratios are low (maximum 1483) and delta15N values are negative (minimum -3.0 per mil). The results identify shallow hemipelagic sediments, subducted into the Guatemalan mantle, as the transport medium for the heavy N. Mass balance arguments indicate that the subducted N is efficiently cycled to the atmosphere by arc volcanism. Therefore, the subduction zone acts as a ""barrier"" to input of sedimentary N to the deeper mantle."

This change was followed by the decrease in carbachol-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and its regulatory proteins, caveolin-1 and heat shock protein 90, did not change in the hypoxic pulmonary artery, indicating that chronic hypoxia impairs eNOS activity at posttranslational level. In the hypoxic pulmonary artery, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ level stimulated by carbachol but not by ionomycin was reduced. We next focused on changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of the eNOS activation system. A morphological study revealed atrophy of endothelial cells and a peripheral condensation of eNOS in hypoxic endothelial cells preserving co-localization between eNOS and Golgi or plasma membranes. However, eNOS was tightly coupled with caveolin-1, and was dissociated from heat shock protein 90 or calmodulin in the hypoxic pulmonary artery in either the presence or absence of carbachol.

Hypoxia occurs commonly in patients with cardiopulmonary disease, and in normal individuals at high altitude. Chronic hypoxia is regarded as one of the critical factors that cause sustained pulmonary hypertension and aggravate pathophysiological conditions, and various forms of pulmonary hypertension pose a significant medical problem. Although there are many studies investigating the role of Kv channel, endothelin-1, and serotonin as the pathogenesis of the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (1Voelkel N.F. Tuder R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Rabinovitch M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Wang J. Juhaszova M. Rubin L.J. Yuan X.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2347-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the mechanism governing the development of this syndrome is unclear. Consequently, current options for effective prevention and therapy are limited. The vascular endothelium releases various vasoactive products such as NO, which contributes not only to the local regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone (4Rudic R.D. Shesely E.G. Maeda N. Smithies O. Segal S.S. Sessa W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), but also to cell proliferation (5Maeda Y. Ikeda U. Oya K. Shimpo M. Ueno S. Okada K.

Impairment of NO release is observed in pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic obstructive lung disease, cardiopulmonary bypass, and congestive heart failure (6Giaid A. Saleh D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar, 7Xue C. Johns R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Chen Y.F. Oparil S. Am. J.

However, serious doubt has been raised, because endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial NO synthase; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; RV, right ventricle; LV+S, left ventricle plus septum; PSS, physiological salt solution; DAF-2DA, diaminofluorescein-2 diacetate; DAF-2, diaminofluorescein-2; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+ level; DAF-2T, diaminotriazolofluorescein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; l-NMMA, N G-monomethyl-l-arginine; N, newton(s); PI, phosphatidylinositol; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate protein expression has been shown to be somewhat up-regulated in pulmonary hypertensive patients (11Komai H.

Pathol. 1998; 185: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and also because eNOS enzyme activity in lung homogenate is increased despite the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats (13Xue C. Rengasamy A., Le Cras T.D. Koberna P.A. Dailey G.C. Johns R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L667-L678PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that impairment of endothelial NO production is a result of down-regulation of eNOS activity at the posttranslational level in the hypertensive pulmonary artery. Enormous progress has recently been achieved in understanding of posttranslational regulatory mechanisms of eNOS. NO is generated in endothelial cells from conversion of l-arginine tol-citrulline by the enzymatic action of eNOS, which requires tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and FMN as cofactors (14Govers R. Rabelink T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F193-F206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). eNOS activity is also regulated by a variety of factors such as acylation by its cellular localization (14Govers R.

Additionally, recent reports have suggested that after increase of cytosolic Ca2+, efficient NO production requires the binding of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to eNOS and eNOS Ser1177phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinase Akt (14Govers R.

The aim of the present study is to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the impairment of endothelium-dependent NO production in pulmonary hypertension using pulmonary artery isolated from hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats. The main focus is first to examine whether decrease in NO generation occurs at eNOS translational and/or posttranslational level at an early stage of pulmonary hypertension, and second to conduct a detailed investigation into dysfunction of posttranslational regulatory mechanisms for eNOS activation. We first report that chronic hypoxia impairs posttranslational regulation of eNOS activity, including abnormal Ca2+homeostasis and close coupling between eNOS and caveolin-1, and that these impairments aggravate pulmonary hypertension. This findings provide new possibilities for improved therapeutic approaches for treating pulmonary hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (165–195 g) were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) at 6 weeks of age. After measurement of weight, rats were randomly divided into two groups, one of which was maintained in room air (normoxia) and the other exposed to normobaric hypoxia (10% O2) in transparent plastic chambers for 1–3 weeks. We gradually reduced oxygen concentration to 10% over 5.0 h. Relative humidity within the chamber was kept with anhydrous CaSO2. Boric acid was used to keep NH3 levels within the chamber at a minimum. To establish the hypoxic environment, the chamber was flushed with nitrogen and the chamber environment was monitored using an oxygen analyzer (MB1000, Chino Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The chamber temperature was maintained at 22–24 °C, and the chamber was opened every other day for 3 min to clean the cage and replenish standard rat chow ad libitum and water supplies. Normoxic rats were housed in identical cages in the same room and breathed room air for 1–3 weeks, with the same (12:12) light-dark cycle. Animal care and treatment were conducted in conformity with the institutional guidelines of the University of Tokyo and are consistent with theGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National Institutes of Health. After exposition to hypoxia or normoxia for 1–3 weeks, body weights were measured. Rats were euthanized and exsanguinations, and thoracotomy was performed. Heart and lungs were removed en bloc, a catheter was inserted into the main pulmonary artery, and the lungs were perfused with saline until the effluent was clear of blood. After the perfusion: (a) right and left main intrapulmonary arteries (<1 mm diameter) were dissected. After removal of the arteries, the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle plus septum (LV+S) were separated and weighed. In the experiments to examine the effect of chronic hypoxia on vascular smooth muscle, the endothelium was removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface with forceps. (b) The lung was perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde through the main pulmonary artery and then placed in 4% paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded lungs were sectioned into 4-μm-thick sections, and the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For each lung section, photo images were captured and measurements of arterial diameter were obtained using an image-processing program (Image 1.55; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Vessels not smaller than 100 μm, nor more than 200 μm, in external diameter were selected, and the area bounded by the internal elastic lamina was subtracted from the area bounded by the external elastic lamina to obtain the area of the medial layer, which was then expressed as a percentage of the total vessel area. Wall thickness was also calculated as the diameter of internal elastic lamina divided by the diameter of the external elastic lamina. Vascular muscle tension was recorded as in the previous paper (19Murata T. Yamawaki H. Yoshimoto R. Hori M. Sato K. Ozaki H. Karaki H. Life Sci. 2001; 69: 2685-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The arterial rings with or without endothelium were placed in normal physiological salt solution (PSS) of the following composition: NaCl, 136.9 mm; KCl, 5.4 mm; CaCl2, 1.5 mm; MgCl2, 1.0 mm; NaHCO3, 23.8 mm; and glucose, 5.5 mm. EDTA (1 μm) was also added to remove contaminating heavy metal ions. The PSS was saturated with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture at 37 °C and pH 7.4. Muscle tension was recorded isometrically with a force-displacement transducer (Orientec, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a strain amplifier (model 3134 or 3170, Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) and an ink-writing recorder (model 3056 or 3711, Yokogawa) under a resting tension of 10 mN. At the end of the experiment, 100 μm papaverine was added to determine the basal tone. Data are shown as percentage of relaxation of the steady-state preconstruction. We used an established fluorescence microscopic technique for visualizing the endotheliumin situ. NO production was monitored by labeling the pulmonary endothelium with diaminofluorescein-2 diacetate (DAF-2DA) de-esterified intracellularly to DAF-2. NO provides the third nitrogen to form a triazo ring from the two amino groups of the nonfluorescent DAF-2, and converts it to diaminotriazolofluorescein (DAF-2T), which is monitored at 488 nm excitation and 540 nm emission (20Broillet M. Randin O. Chatton J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Sugimoto K. Fujii S. Takemasa T. Yamashita K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, measurement of intracellular Ca2+level ([Ca2+]i) in endothelial cells in situ was performed according to the method using fluo-4AM as described previously (22Sato K. Ozaki H. Karaki H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 114-119PubMed Google Scholar). The artery (1 mm wide) was incubated in PSS with 1 μm DAF-2DA (Daiichi Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.02% Cremophor EL for 45 min at 37 °C, or with 5 μm fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes) and 0.02% Cremophor EL for 30 min at 25 °C. After the incubation, the artery was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, and was opened into a strip. The opened strip was mounted on a stage of laser microscope and the images were captured by means of a fluorescence imaging system (Aquacosmos, Hamamatsu Photonics, Tokyo, Japan) (magnification, ×600). We confirmed that carbachol, but not high K+, induced an increase in [Ca2+]i under this loading condition, because smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells have voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (22Sato K. Ozaki H. Karaki H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 255: 114-119PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nakazawa H. Hori M. Ozaki H. Karaki H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The increase in NO signal by carbachol was abolished by rubbing the endothelium and pretreatment with NO inhibitor, l-NMMA (200 μm), for 30 min, suggesting that DAF-2T fluorescence was derived from NO produced by endothelial cells. Images of vascular endothelial cells stained with DAF-2T or fluo-4 were taken every 20 and 15 s, respectively, at 37 °C. After observation of the DAF-2T response to carbachol, the NO donor NOC 5 (100 μm), which induced a maximum increase in DAF-2T, was added to obtain the relative amount of NO production. For quantification, each endothelial cell selected at random was outlined and its fluorescent intensity was measured over time. For each artery, the mean fluorescent intensities of 4–7 endothelial cells were averaged, as were fluorescent intensity of 4–8 arteries for each condition. The microscope was equipped with 488 nm (excitation) and 540 nm (emission) filters. Subsequent to incubation with or without test agent, pulmonary arteries (∼3 mm wide) with or without endothelium were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 6% trichloroacetic acid solution (300 μl). After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants (50 μl) were applied to a cGMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), whereas pellets were used to determine protein content by the Bradford method. cGMP contents are expressed as fmol/μg of protein content. The arterial rings were fixed in iced acetone for 10 min (for Golgi staining) or in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min (for caveolin-1 and von Willebrand factor staining). Fixed arteries were incubated in 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% normal goat serum (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) dissolved in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibodies (anti-eNOS monoclonal antibody, anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal antibody, or anti-von Willebrand factor polyclonal antibody) were diluted (1:1000) in PBS and applied for 8 h at 4 °C. After a PBS rinse, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) or Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:500), were applied for 1 h at 37 °C. Additionally, to label the Golgi complex, arterial rings were probed with Texas Red-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (1:100) for 3 h at 37 °C and then rinsed. The images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan) (magnification, ×630). The microscope was equipped with excitation (FITC, 458–488 nm; Texas Red, 543 nm) and emission (FITC, 520 nm; Texas Red, 570 nm) filters. Five-μm-thick images from the endothelial cell surface were digitized under constant exposure time, gain, and offset. After capturing images, protein co-localization and cell area were measured using the LSM510 program. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were performed as previous reports (16Gratton J.P.

Briefly, pulmonary arteries in the absence or presence of 1 μm carbachol for 3, 6, and 9 min were homogenized on ice in a Triton X-100 homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm aprotinin). After centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used for Western blot analysis to measure the eNOS, caveolin-1, HSP90, Akt, and phospho-Akt protein expressions. Equal amounts (60 μg) of protein from the total homogenate of the arteries were loaded on the SDS-PAGE. In the other experiments to examine the caveolin-1, calmodulin, and HSP90 binding into eNOS or to detect the phospho-Ser1177eNOS protein expression, the supernatant was incubated with anti-eNOS polyclonal antibody (dilution of 1:100) overnight at 4 °C following immunoprecipitation with protein A (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Equal amounts (20 μg) of immunoprecipitated protein were loaded. Antibodies that recognize phospho-eNOS and the other proteins were used at a dilution of 1:200 and 1:500, respectively. The densitometric intensity was quantified by using an image-processing program (Image 1.55). To ensure that the same amounts of proteins were loaded, we confirmed that the same densitometric intensities of actin were observed in each preparation. The antibodies used were anti-eNOS monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and HSP90 antibody (BD PharMingen); anti-phosphorylated eNOS, anti-Akt antibody, and anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody (Cell Signaling); anti-calmodulin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); anti-von Willebrand factor antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark); wheat germ agglutinin Texas Red conjugated (Molecular Probes); FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories). The results of the experiments are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical evaluation of the data was performed by unpaired Student's t test for comparisons between two groups, and by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for comparisons between more than two groups. A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as significant. As shown in Table I, body weight was lower in the 1-week, 2-week, and 3-week hypoxic rats than in normoxic rats (n = 7–9). In the 1-week hypoxic pulmonary artery, muscularization of the distal pulmonary artery in hypoxic rats by hematoxylin and eosin staining was observed; the muscularization worsened with the exposure length (n = 6 each). Additionally, ratios of the RV weight to body weight and RV weight to LV+S weight were higher in hypoxic rats, suggesting the right ventricular hypertrophy (n = 6 each). The cardiac hypertrophy also worsened with the exposure length (n = 6 each). These provided a reliable index of pulmonary hypertension in this model (1Voelkel N.F. Tuder R.M. J. Clin.

Dimensions were demarcated by the external (ext) and internal (int) elastic laminae. In 1-week normoxic or hypoxic pulmonary arteries with endothelium, cumulative addition of phenylephrine (1 nm to 10 μm) induced contractions of similar amplitudes (a maximum force of 14.1 ± 0.8 and 12.5 ± 2.2 mN/mg wet weight, respectively) in a concentration-dependent manner (n = 5 each). In both the 1-week normoxic and hypoxic pulmonary arteries with endothelium, carbachol (3 nm to 30 μm) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the contraction elicited by 100 nm phenylephrine (data not shown). In the 1-week hypoxic pulmonary arteries, however, the maximum relaxation induced by carbachol (30 μm) was significantly smaller than that in the 1-week normoxic pulmonary arteries (Fig.1 A). The impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation was also observed in 2- and 3-week hypoxic pulmonary artery (Fig. 1 A). From the results of right ventricular hypertrophy, muscularization of the distal pulmonary artery, and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation, we used 1-week hypoxic rats as an early stage pulmonary hypertensive model in following experiments. The vasodilator effect of the calcium ionophore ionomycin (100 μm) was also significantly weaker in hypoxic (1 week) pulmonary arteries (Fig.1 B, left bars). In the arteries without endothelium, carbachol was ineffective. Carbachol-induced relaxation was eliminated by pretreatment with a NOS inhibitor, N G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) (200 μm) for 30 min before the addition of phenylephrine (n = 6 each; data not shown). Treatment with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 μm) for 30 min before the addition of phenylephrine did not change the endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by carbachol (n = 4 each; data not shown). These results suggest that carbachol-induced relaxation of the pulmonary arteries is attributable mainly to NO production. Recent reports revealed that various stimuli activate eNOS through a PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent pathway (14Govers R. Rabelink T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F193-F206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C.

Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). In the present study, treatment with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (10 μm), for 30 min attenuated carbachol-induced relaxation (n = 6 each; data not shown), suggesting that PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent eNOS activation plays a role in carbachol-induced NO generation in the pulmonary artery. We further examined the effect of hypoxia on the NO sensitivity of smooth muscle. In the normoxic and hypoxic pulmonary arteries without endothelium, sodium nitroprusside (3 μm) similarly inhibited contractions elicited by 100 nm phenylephrine (Fig. 1 B, right bars;n = 4 each). We then examined whether hypoxia-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation was caused by depletion ofl-arginine, a precursor of NO, or tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for NO production. Each preparation was treated withl-arginine (1 mm) and/or tetrahydrobiopterin (1 μm) for 20 min before the addition of phenylephrine. These treatments did not affect the 30 μm carbachol-induced relaxation (Fig. 1 C;n = 5–9). With a view to confirming the decrease in NO production in the hypoxic artery, we used a fluorescence microscopic technique to visualize the pulmonary arterial endotheliumin situ using DAF-2DA (20Broillet M. Randin O. Chatton J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Sugimoto K. Fujii S. Takemasa T. Yamashita K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 113: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the normoxic pulmonary artery, endothelial cells exhibited a progressive increase in fluorescent intensity by carbachol (1 μm). As clearly demonstrated in Fig. 2 A, the increase in fluorescent intensity was significantly smaller in the hypoxic pulmonary artery than in the normoxic artery. We also measured cGMP content to estimate the NO production and confirmed the significant decrease in NO production under both stimulated (1 μm carbachol for 2 min) and unstimulated conditions in hypoxic pulmonary artery (Fig. 2 B). Treatment with sodium nitroprusside (1 μm) for 3 min, in contrast, increased the cGMP content in both the normoxic and hypoxic pulmonary arteries. Because eNOS is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, we examined the changes in endothelial [Ca2+]iinduced by 1 μm carbachol and 100 nm ionomycin. As shown in Fig.3 A, carbachol induced a transient increase in [Ca2+]ifollowed by a sustained increase in both normoxic and hypoxic arteries. Both the peak and sustained phases of [Ca2+]i were significantly smaller in the hypoxic pulmonary artery than those in the normoxic pulmonary artery. On the other hand, ionomycin-induced sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in hypoxic pulmonary arteries did not change from that in the normoxic pulmonary artery (Fig. 3 B). The localization of eNOS on the caveolae in plasma membrane and Golgi complex in endothelial cells is considered to be important for its activation (14Govers R. Rabelink T.J. Am. J.

Recent work has demonstrated that flagellin is a potent trigger of innate immune responses in a number of eukaryotic cells and organisms, including both mammals and plants.

The mechanisms by which flagellin activates TLR5 and the importance of this interaction in other model systems of flagellin-induced inflammation remain unknown. In this work, random and site-directed mutagenesis of the inflammatory flagellin from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli identified two regions in the conserved D1 domain that are required for interleukin-8 release and TLR5 activation. In contrast, large regions of the variable domain could be excised without reducing the inflammatory activity. In addition, regions of the protein analogous to epitopes that trigger innate immune responses in plants are not involved in Caco-2 flagellin responses.

Most Gram-negative bacteria express flagella, surface structures that confer motility. Flagella are composed of a basal body that serves as a rotatory motor, a filament that extends into the space around the bacterium to provide motive force, and a hook that connects the two. The filament consists of a long homopolymer of a single protein, flagellin, with a small cap protein at the end. Polymerization of flagellin occurs as a result of relatively conserved structures at the N and C termini, although the intervening regions of the protein are highly diverse. The crystal structure of a central proteolytic fragment of flagellin was recently solved, contributing to an understanding of how these conserved structures are involved in filament formation (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar). In addition to their role in bacterial motility, an accumulation of recent evidence suggests that flagella also enhance the pathogenicity of certain organisms, either by promoting adherence to host tissues or by directly activating host inflammatory signaling pathways. Alterations in flagellar expression are associated with decreased virulence in several animal models of bacterial pathogenesis, includingPseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection (2DiMango E. Zar H.J.

In addition, bacterial flagella from plant pathogens can induce immune responses in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (13Felix G. Duran J.D. Volko S. Boller T.

These findings suggest that recognition of bacterial flagella by the innate immune system is a widespread phenomenon among higher eukaryotes. Recent reports indicate that the component of flagella responsible for eliciting host immune responses is the filament protein flagellin.

Salmonella typhimurium flagellin is translocated across T84 cell monolayers during in vitro infection, where it acts basolaterally to cause IL-8 release (20Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 99-109Google Scholar). This effect was shown to be caused by activation of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) (21Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Google Scholar). Flagellin from Listeria monocytogenes also signals through TLR5, leading to systemic IL-6 release from challenged mice in a myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent manner (22Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R., Yi, E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar). Although it is evident from these reports that flagellin triggers immune responses in several systems, the mechanisms involved and the structural features of flagellin that elicit them remain unknown. In particular, it is unclear whether immune activation is specific to flagellins from particular microorganisms or conserved epitopes of flagellin form a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that is recognized by pattern-recognition receptors in a similar fashion to other pathogen-associated molecular patterns (such as lipopolysaccharide or CpG DNA). The studies described below were undertaken to answer these questions by examining the inflammatory structural elements of flagellin from enteroaggregative Escherichia coli strain 042, a well characterized diarrheal pathogen. We have previously shown that this flagellin (termed FliC-EAEC) potently elicits IL-8 secretion from several intestinal cell lines (19Steiner T. Nataro J. Poteet-Smith C. Smith J. Guerrant R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105Google Scholar). Using both site-directed and random mutagenesis, we demonstrate that disruption of two specific regions in the constant domains of flagellin eliminates IL-8 induction and TLR5 activation. EAEC strain 042, originally isolated from a child in Chile, was obtained from James Nataro (Center for Vaccine Development, University of Maryland). The cloning and expression hosts Top10F′ and BL21 (DE3) pLysS were obtained from Invitrogen. To express recombinant flagellin,fliC genes were amplified from bacterial colonies by PCR, using the following primers: start, 5′-GGATCCATGGCACAAGTCATTAAT-3′; end, 5′-TTCGAATTAACCCTGCTGCAGAGA-3′. The resulting fragments were cloned into pCRT7/NT Topo TA (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This plasmid contains an N-terminal His6 fusion under control of the T7 promoter. The vector containing the fliC gene from 042 (pfliC-EAEC) was used as the base for subsequent mutagenesis. Deletion mutants (with the exception of Del 0) were generated by two-step PCR and cloned into the BamHI and SfuI sites flanking the fliC gene in pfliC-EAEC. Point mutations were generated by either two-step PCR or by circular PCR withDpnI digestion to eliminate background wild-type plasmid. To create the Del 0 mutant, the BclI-StuI fragment corresponding to bases 34–176 of fliC-EAEC was excised, and the gel-purified plasmid backbone was blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease (MBI Fermentas, Burlington, ON, Canada) to maintain the open reading frame after religation. Transposon linker mutagenesis was performed on purified pfliC-EAEC using the EZ::TN in-frame linker insertion kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Kanamycin-resistant clones were screened for insertion within the fliC gene by restriction digestion. Clones of interest were digested with NotI and religated to yield plasmids with 19 amino acid insertions in-frame in all six frames. The exact site of the linker insertion was verified by sequencing. Expression of recombinant FliC from these clones was performed as described below; only clones yielding a product of the correct size seen by SDS-PAGE were analyzed further. pfliC-EAEC and its derived vectors with mutant fliC genes were maintained in Top10F′. For expression, plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysSand grown in Luria broth with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Log-phase cultures were induced with 0.5 to 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 37° C and then pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles followed by sonication (three 10-s pulses), and lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15,000 ×g for 20 min). Cleared lysates were then tested for Caco-2 cell IL-8 release (2 μl/well; see below). Lysates with absent or reduced activity were purified to verify expression of a full-length protein. These recombinant His-tagged flagellins were purified under native conditions by metal affinity chromatography. Protein expression was verified by electrophoresis on 9% SDS-PAGE, after which proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with a Ni2+-horseradish peroxidase reagent to detect His6-tagged proteins (India His-probe horseradish peroxidase; Pierce). Eluted proteins in 200–250 mmimidazole were used without buffer exchange to screen for activity on Caco-2 cells, which do not release IL-8 in response to LPS or to imidazole. For experiments on HEp-2 cells, flagellin was first purified of LPS by polymixin B chromatography (Detoxi-Gel; Pierce). Flagellin prepared this way had no detectable LPS by Limulus assay (data not shown). Caco-2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/literd-glucose, 1× sodium pyruvate, 1× nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell culture reagents and serum were obtained from various sources (Sigma; Invitrogen; and Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and produced no differences in growth or inflammatory response. For IL-8 release assays, cells were seeded into 24-well polystyrene dishes at 5 × 105/well and generally used 7–21 days later. To screen flagellin samples for IL-8 release, wells were filled with 500 μl of fresh growth medium and protein samples (up to 10 μg in 50 μl) were added. After 3 h, culture medium was removed and tested for IL-8 concentration by enzyme immunoassay (OptEIA IL-8; BD Pharmingen, Mississauga, ON, Canada). To determine the EC50 of flagellins, three to four 5-fold dilutions of flagellin were screened, and the inflection point of the dose-response curve was used as the EC50. The Flg22 and Flg15ECpeptides were provided by Georg Felix (Friedrich Miescher-Institute, Basel, Switzerland). They were synthesized and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The Flg22 peptide was eluted as a pure single peak and the Flg15 peptide was a partially purified preparation. Peptides were solubilized at 10 mm or 1 mm in water and diluted in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin before testing. pEF6/V5-His containing the humantlr5 gene was obtained from A. Aderem (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was used as a transfection control. HEp-2 cells were obtained from B. Brett Finlay (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada). They were maintained in Ham's F12 medium with 1× penicillin/streptomycin and 5% fetal bovine serum. Before transfection, HEp-2 cells were released with 0.25% trypsin EDTA and seeded at 105/well in 12-well polystyrene dishes. After 24–48 h, the medium was replaced with Ham's F12 medium without serum. Cells were then transfected with DNA using 0.5 μg of each plasmid and 6.6 μl/well ExGen-500 polyethyleneimine reagent (MBI Fermentas). Plates were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g, incubated for 30 min, and then fed with growth medium. Expression of green fluorescent protein was confirmed at 24–48 h by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were then fed with 1 ml of fresh growth medium, and flagellin samples were added. Supernatants were removed after 3 h for IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cells were rinsed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) and lysed by freezing/thawing in distilled water. Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and fluorescence was measured in a VersaFluor fluorometer (Bio-Rad). Relative fluorescent units were divided by protein concentration to give a measure of transfection efficiency to which IL-8 expression values were standardized. Protein samples were dialyzed against PBS for 24 h and assayed for protein by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were diluted to 12.5 μg/ml in PBS and analyzed in triplicate on a Jasco J-810 CD spectrometer (Jasco, Easton, MD). Tracings were truncated at 200 nm because of the high signal from the buffer below that value. Spectra were subtracted and analyzed using Spectra Manager software (Jasco). Based on prior observations showing that only a subset of E. coli flagellins were inflammatory (19Steiner T. Nataro J. Poteet-Smith C. Smith J. Guerrant R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105Google Scholar), we initially hypothesized that the IL-8-releasing activity of EAEC 042 flagellin would be dependent on epitopes in the central, variable domain of the molecule. To identify these epitopes, six deletion mutants of flagellin were generated. As shown in Table II, only one of these, Del 1, failed to release IL-8 from Caco-2 cells. The region deleted in Del 1 spans amino acids 57 to 190, consisting of the last 121 residues of the N-terminal constant domain and the first 12 residues of the variable domain. None of the remaining sections of the variable domain were required for activity, as evidenced by the wild-type activity of Del 2, Del 3, Del 4, and Del 5 (Table I).Table IIMutants with absent IL-8-releasing activity (at doses up to 10 μg)SampleType of mutantSite of mutationdel 1Engineered deletionN57–D1902H3TransposonGln-488E8TransposonIle-487F11TransposonGly-485C5TransposonAsn-489 Open table in a new tab Table IEngineered mutants of FliC-EAEC with preserved IL-8-releasing activity on Caco-2 cellsNameDescriptionG47AG47AAtumI38V, N39G, S40QΔQAQ48L, A49QQ488AQ488AA486LA486LΔSLGS483A, L484A, G485AΔ5N404VΔ2I433A, T434A, S435A, G436Adel 2T187–S266del 3V267–Q336del 4A337–T394del 5L395–T441 Open table in a new tab To screen smaller sections of the protein for activity, random transposon linker mutagenesis was performed on pfliC-EAEC. As shown in Fig.1 and Table II, four of 37 mutants were devoid of IL-8-releasing activity. Notably, all four of these null mutants were located within a five-residue stretch near the start of the C-terminal constant domain. This finding was of particular interest because several natural polymorphisms that alter flagellar filament structure occur in the corresponding region of S. typhimurium FliC (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar). Two of these polymorphisms (G426A and A427V) are analogous to Gly-485 and Ala-486 in FliC-EAEC, the insertion sites of two of the linker mutations that eliminate IL-8-releasing activity (Fig. 1). To determine whether the loss of activity could be explained by altered filament structure, several point mutations were generated in this region (Q488A, ΔSLG, and A486L). These possessed full inflammatory activity, suggesting that localized disruption by the 19-amino acid linker insertion is probably more important that the alteration or displacement of individual residues and that altered filament structure cannot fully explain the loss of inflammatory activity. Several of the transposon mutants obtained were able to elicit IL-8 release from Caco-2 cells, but with reduced potency compared with wild-type FliC-EAEC (TableIII). These were purified and analyzed by dose-response titration. As shown in Fig.2, most of these mutants (with the exception of 2C3) had the same maximal activity as FliC-EAEC, although they required much higher concentrations to achieve this effect. Mutant 2C3 (linker insertion after E79) had a relatively low EC50, but its maximal IL-8 release was less than half that of FliC-EAEC in the same experiment. Interestingly, this insertion is early in the region deleted in mutant Del 1 described above. Only one of the partially active mutants contained an insertion in the variable domain (after Thr-296). However, this region of the protein is dispensable for IL-8-releasing activity, because Del 3, which lacks this region, is fully active. This suggests that altered tertiary structure or steric hindrance, rather than disruption of a specific epitope, is responsible for the effects of this linker insertion.Table IIIMutants with intermediate IL-8-releasing activitySampleType of mutantSite of mutationApprox.

In addition, one engineered mutant with intermediate IL-8-releasing activity, Del 0, lacked most of the N-terminal disordered region of FliC-EAEC. These regions of the protein were excised before crystallization of the Salmonella flagellin (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar), so their contributions to FliC structure are not certain. However, they are predicted to face the inner tube of the flagellar filament, along with the region disrupted by the noninflammatory transposon mutants (2H3, F8, E11, and C5) (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar). This suggests that an interaction between these regions may be required for normal flagellin polymerization as well as for inflammatory activity. It has recently been observed that several plant species exhibit an immune response to flagellins from plant pathogens. A consensus peptide from near the N terminus of these flagellins (termed Flg22) is a potent stimulant of this inflammatory response, which is mediated by one or more transmembrane proteins with structural similarity to toll-like receptors. FliC-EAEC contains a similar consensus sequence, from E30 through A52. This raised the hypothesis that FliC-EAEC signals inflammation through the corresponding peptide epitope. However, Flg22 and Flg15EC, whose sequences are shown in TableIV, were completely inactive in releasing IL-8 from Caco-2 cells at concentrations as high as 1 mm. Moreover, they were unable to inhibit IL-8 release caused by FliC-EAEC, even at a 108 molar excess. In addition, alterations in this peptide sequence shown to reduce or eliminate signaling in plants were duplicated in FliC-EAEC (Table IV). These mutations did not affect the inflammatory activity of FliC-EAEC (Tables II and IV). Finally, the mutant Del 0, described above, maintained partial inflammatory activity despite the complete removal of the region containing the Flg22 sequence. Together, these findings demonstrate that the innate immune response to bacterial flagellin, although present in both mammals and plants, is directed at different epitopes.Table IVActivities of flagellins altered in the N-terminal conserved peptide regionSampleSequencePlant responseIL-8 responseFlg22QRLSTGSRINSAKDDAAGLQIA++0Flg15ECRINSAKDDAAGQAIA+0Flg15R.

Residues altered in engineered mutants are shown in bold. Flagellins from L. monocytogenesand S. typhimurium activate nuclear factor-κB in epithelial cells in a TLR5-dependent manner (21Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Google Scholar, 22Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R., Yi, E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar). It was previously not known whether FliC-EAEC also activates TLR5 and whether this activation is required for IL-8 release. The most straightforward way to determine this would have been to inhibit TLR5 activity in Caco-2 cells either by transient transfection with a dominant-negative TLR5 construct or with a blocking antibody. However, Caco-2 cells have a poor transfection efficiency, especially after differentiation in confluent monolayers, which is the state at which flagellin IL-8 responses occur. Moreover, no blocking antibody is commercially available. Therefore, HEp-2 cells were used as a model, because they transfect more readily and do not release IL-8 in response to flagellin in their native state. As shown in Fig. 3, HEp-2 cells transfected with a constitutive TLR5 expression vector released significantly more IL-8 in response to flagellin than did untransfected cells. TLR5 expression alone did not lead to IL-8 release. Likewise, the noninflammatory flagellin mutants 2H3 and Del 1 did not cause IL-8 release from HEp-2 cells expressing TLR5. These findings suggest that the same conformational features of flagellin which activate Caco-2 cells are also required to activate TLR5 in transiently transfected HEp-2 cells and that the lack of inflammatory activity of the flagellin mutants is probably caused by the inability to signal through TLR5. One explanation for the lack of inflammatory activity of Del 1 and 2H3 could be dramatic alterations of protein structure leading to improper folding as opposed to the disruption of a discrete epitope. CD spectroscopy on FliC-EAEC, 2H3, and Del 1 was used to examine the possibility of gross changes in secondary and tertiary structure. As shown in Fig.4, the spectra of FliC-EAEC and Del 1 were nearly identical, with a shoulder at 220 nm and minimum at 208 nm, consistent with the spectrum of S. typhimurium flagellin reported previously (23Steiner T. Lima A. Nataro J. Guerrant R. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 88-96Google Scholar). The 2H3 mutant had a slight shift of its nadir to 206 nm, but otherwise the tracings were very similar. These findings suggest that the lack of inflammatory activity of these altered flagellins are caused by disruption of specific active regions of the protein rather than to major distortions in overall protein structure. The studies reported here demonstrate the complexity of the innate immune recognition of flagellin. The results show that large regions of the variable domain of FliC-EAEC can be deleted or altered by linker insertion without disrupting inflammatory activity. Random linker mutagenesis identified only one narrow region of the C-terminal constant domain whose alteration eliminated IL-8 releasing activity. Despite the vulnerability of flagellin to linker insertions in this site, point mutations there, including some known to alter filament structure, had no effect on the inflammatory activity. Moreover, deletion of a length of the N-terminal constant domain (far removed from this site) also yielded a noninflammatory flagellin. In addition, some linker insertions at a significant distance from these critical sites attenuated but did not eliminate inflammatory potency. Finally, the results show that epitopes of flagellin recognized by innate immune receptors in plants are not required for flagellin signaling in mammalian cells. Bacterial flagellins elicit potent inflammatory responses in a number of eukaryotic cells. In at least two systems, this inflammation is mediated through TLR5 (21Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Google Scholar, 22Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R., Yi, E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors are characterized by extracellular leucine-rich repeats, believed to confer ligand specificity, and intracellular Tir domains, believed to signal via adapter molecules, such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase. All of the TLR activators identified so far are pathogen-associated molecular patterns, molecular signatures found in microorganisms but not in eukaryotic hosts (such as LPS, lipoteichoic acid, double-stranded RNA, and unmethylated CpG DNA). If TLR5 signaling is analogous, then flagellin should display a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that eukaryotic organisms have learned to recognize through coevolution with bacteria. For this hypothesis to be correct, the TLR5 recognition site(s) of flagellin would have to be located in the conserved domains of the protein, because the variable domains are highly divergent. This would suggest, in turn, that flagellin from most, if not all, enteric Gram-negative bacteria would be able to activate TLR5, because they share these conserved domains. Some evidence in support of this hypothesis is that culture filtrates from nonpathogenic, gut-derived, flagellated E. coli were able to induce IL-8 release from T84 cells and nitric oxide release from DLD-1 cells (12Eaves-Pyles T. Murthy K. Liaudet L. Virag L. Ross G. Soriano F.G. Szabo C. Salzman A.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1248-1260Google Scholar, 21Gewirtz A.T. Navas T.A. Lyons S. Godowski P.J. Madara J.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1882-1885Google Scholar). However, there are other reports of nonpathogenic E. coli strains failing to induce the CCL20 chemokine (18Sierro F. Dubois B. Coste A. Kaiserlian D. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Sirard J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13722-13727Google Scholar), to activate TLR5 (22Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R., Yi, E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Google Scholar), or to elicit IL-8 release from epithelial cells (23Steiner T. Lima A. Nataro J. Guerrant R. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 88-96Google Scholar). Thus, the question of whether inflammatory activity is a widespread feature of Gram-negative flagellins or a specific trait of individual pathogens remains unanswered. One way to address these questions is to generate flagellin mutants and to screen them for activity. There are two reports of such experiments, with conflicting results. McDermott et al. (24McDermott P.F. Ciacci-Woolwine F. Snipes J.A. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5525-5529Google Scholar) found that tumor necrosis factor-α release from monocytes was induced by full-length Salmonella enteritidis flagellin or by a peptide spanning the variable domain (although at reduced potency). Deletion of either the N- or C-terminal half of the variable domain reduced the potency further but still yielded an inflammatory molecule. However, a flagellin completely lacking the variable domain was inactive. These findings led to the conclusion that the variable domain of flagellin contains two separate inflammatory epitopes but that tertiary structure conferred by the constant domains is required to display these epitopes effectively. In contrast to these findings, Eaves-Pyles et al. (17Eaves-Pyles T.D. Wong H.R. Odoms K. Pyles R.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7009-7016Google Scholar) showed that a construct containing the N- and C-terminal constant regions of Salmonella dublin flagellin separated by an E. coli hinge element was as active as wild-type flagellin. They concluded from these data that the constant domains of flagellin contain the inflammatory epitopes and that the variable domains are necessary only to keep the constant regions in proper apposition. Several characteristics of flagellin make these questions difficult to answer conclusively. One is that the protein autopolymerizes at high concentrations or in the presence of certain salts (25Vonderviszt F. Kanto S. Aizawa S. Namba K. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 127-133Google Scholar), making crystallization of the full-length protein elusive so far. The fact that recombinant flagellin is as active as flagellar filaments sheared from live bacteria suggests that full-length filament formation is not required for inflammatory activity. However, it is not known whether some degree of autopolymerization of recombinant molecules occurs under the conditions tested in vitro. In addition, certain pathogenic bacteria can post-translationally modify flagellin, and the importance of these modified residues to inflammation has not been examined (11Ciacci-Woolwine F. Blomfield I.C. Richardson S.H. Mizel S.B. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1127-1134Google Scholar). The findings reported here substantially increase knowledge regarding the molecular basis for innate immune recognition of flagellin. We demonstrate that linker insertions within a five-residue stretch of the C-terminal constant domain of FLiC-EAEC eliminated both Caco-2 cell IL-8 release and TLR5-mediated responses in HEp-2 cells. Moreover, deletion of portions of the N-terminal constant region also abrogated the inflammatory response to flagellin. In contrast, most of the variable domain seemed to be dispensable for this activity. The presumed locations of these mutations on the folded flagellin protein (based on the crystal structure of the S. typhimurium fragment (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar)) are shown in Fig.5. The transposon linker insertions which eliminate inflammatory activity (2H3, E8, F11, C5) are located near the midpoint of the α-helix formed by the C-terminal conserved domain of the protein. The Del 1 mutation removes the apposed α-helix formed by the N-terminal conserved domain. These regions are predicted by the crystal analysis to form the axial skeleton of the flagellar filament. The region altered by the transposon insertions is predicted to face the inner hollow tube of the filament, along with portions of the extreme N and C termini, which are believed to form loose, unstructured helices but were excised before crystallization (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar, 26Samatey F.A. Imada K. Vonderviszt F. Shirakihara Y. Namba K. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 132: 106-111Google Scholar). This same region of the protein is the site of several natural polymorphisms in the Salmonella flagellin that confer altered filament structure (1Samatey F.A. Imada K. Nagashima S. Vonderviszt F. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Namba K. Nature. 2001; 410: 331-337Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that innate immune recognition of flagellin requires a tertiary structural element formed by the apposition of the two long α-helices within the D1 domain. The partial reduction in inflammatory activity of mutants Del 0, 2C3, and 2D12 could be explained by disruption of the distal portions of these helices, leading to altered tertiary structure. This model does not explain the reduced inflammatory activity of mutant E9, which carries its insertion in the D3 domain, far removed from the presumed critical site, nor does it explain why various groups have reported that some flagellins expressed by nonpathogenic E. coli are noninflammatory, because they presumably must share these critical conserved structures to make functional flagella. It is possible that these noninflammatory flagellins carry one or more spontaneous point mutations or deletions within the D1 region. Alternatively, there might be post-translational modifications of critical residues within the D1 domain that affect innate immune recognition but not filament formation. Further studies to address these questions should shed considerable light on how flagellin is recognized by mammalian cells. We thank Drs. Richard Guerrant, Brett Finlay, and Neil Reiner for valuable mentorship and for criticism of this work. We also thank Dr. Georg Felix for providing the flagellin peptides and David Oliver for assistance with CD spectroscopy."

However, the key question is how these pattern recognition molecules can induce activation of the proPO system in response to microbial infection. One hypothesis is that the pattern recognition molecules make a complex with the proPO-activating enzyme(s) and microbial cell wall components, and then activated proPO activating enzyme(s) will convert proPO to active phenoloxidase (PO) by limited proteolysis (1Söderhäll K.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), a nonproteolytic serine protease-like protein with a mutation in the catalytic triad, making this protein without serine protease activity. This protein is expressed during embryogenesis, larval, and pupal development inDrosophila melanogaster. The proPPAF-II protein contains a trypsin-like serine protease domain in the carboxyl terminus, except for a substitution of Ser in the active site triad to Gly and a clip domain in the amino terminus. Even though the numbers of clip domains are different between proPPAF-II and Drosophila masquerade, the catalytic domain, except for the serine residue and the disulfide linkages, is perfectly conserved in each of these two proteins. In this study we have investigated the complex activation mechanism of the proPO system in H. diomphalia by isolating and characterizing three new proPO components and by studying the sequential activation of three proPPAFs and two proPOs. Methods for raising the insects and collecting the hemolymph were as described previously (16Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Hemocytes were collected from the hemolymph by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with anticoagulation buffer, and stored at −80 °C. About 3 × 109 packed cells were obtained from 500 ml of hemolymph. The supernatant was taken as plasma, adjusted to pH 4.6 with 1m citric acid solution, and stored at −80 °C until use. The hemocyte lysate was prepared according to our previously published method (10Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Holotrichia proPOs were purified as described previously (17Kwon T.H. Lee S.Y. Lee J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 90-97PubMed Google Scholar). The active PPAF-I and proPPAF-II were purified according to our previous published methods (10Kwon T.H. Kim M.S. Choi H.W. Joo C.H. Cho M.Y. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6188-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The PO assay was carried out as described previously (9Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of purified 27-kDa PPAF-III on proPO activation, a mixture consisting of purified proPOs (2 μg), purified active PPAF-I (1 μg), proPPAF-II (1 μg), and purified PPAF-III protein (1 μg) was added to 400 μl of substrate solution (1 mm 4-methylcatechol and 2 mm4-hydroxyproline ethyl ester in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) in the presence or absence of 5 mm CaCl2. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the increase in absorbance at 520 nm was measured, and PO activity was expressed as the change in absorbance at 520 nm/10 min of incubation (A 520/10 min). After ultracentrifugation of plasma at 203,000 ×g for 4 h at 4 °C, the resulting supernatant was diluted 10× with buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.5) containing 5 mm EDTA), and about 1000 ml was applied to a dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column (φ1.5 × 50 cm) equilibrated and washed with buffer A. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in buffer A. When the hemocyte lysate containing proPOs and proPPAF-II was incubated with fractions from the dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column with Ca2+, fractions showing PO activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10, Amicon). We then found that two different fractions were necessary to induce PO activity in the hemocyte lysate; these fractions were named Gr-1 and Gr-2. The Gr-1 fraction contained PPAF-I, which was proven by Western blotting analysis using a PPAF-I antibody. To purify another PPAF from the Gr-2 fraction, namely PPAF-III, 3 ml of the concentrated Gr-2 solution was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (φ2 × 120 cm) equilibrated and eluted with buffer A. Fractions showing PO activity when incubated with hemocyte lysate, Gr-1, and 5 mmCa2+ were pooled and then were diluted with buffer B (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 1.7 m(NH4)2SO4) and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose FPLC equilibrated with buffer B. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 1.7 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer B, and fractions containing a 27-kDa PPAF protein were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The ammonium sulfate was removed by repeated ultrafiltration with buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) and then applied to a Mono-Q FPLC column equilibrated with buffer C. The absorbed proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.4m NaCl in buffer C. Fractions from the Mono-Q FPLC column showing PO activity when incubated with purified proPO, PPAF-I, and proPPAF-II, pooled, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The purified PPAF-III was reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were separated by HPLC on a C18 reverse-phase column (18Fullmer C.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 142: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the PPAF-III and internal tryptic peptides were determined using an Applied Biosystems Procise automated gas-phase sequencer (19LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 154-159PubMed Google Scholar). An antiserum against PPAF-III was raised by injecting 10 μg of the purified protein into a male albino rabbit with complete Freund's adjuvant and giving it a booster injection of the same amount of protein 14 days later. The resulting antiserum was affinity-purified as described previously (16Lee S.Y. Kwon T.H. Hyun J.H. Choi J.S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Six partial amino acid sequences of the purified PPAF-III were determined. Among them, a DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to NKYVQPIC was synthesized as follows: 5′-AA(T/C)AA(A/G)TA(T/C)GTICA(A/G)CCIAT(T/C/A)TG-3′. This oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by a previously described method (20Sgaramella V. Khorana H.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 72: 427-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A cDNA library of H. diomphalia larvae was constructed using a previously published method (9Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We screened 5 × 104 colonies and obtained six hybridization-positive clones. We analyzed two plasmids containing six chemically determined amino acid sequences and an amino-terminal sequence. To screen for Holotrichia proPO clones, we performed immunoscreening by using the affinity-purifiedHolotrichia proPO antibody prepared as described previously (21Cho M.Y. Lee H.S. Lee K.M. Homma K.I. Natori S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the proPPAF-III andHolotrichia proPOs were compared with the protein sequence data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Genetyx system (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo). To examine the biological functions of PPAF-I, proPPAF-II, and PPAF-III during proPO activation, PO activity was measured using the purified proPOs, PPAF-I, proPPAF-II, and PPAF-III with or without Ca2+. When PO activity was evident, the reaction mixture was treated with trichloroacetic acid to precipitate proteins and was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The amino-terminal sequences of the generated bands were determined by automated amino acid sequence analysis. We purified proPOs and proPPAF-II from hemocyte lysate and activated PPAF-I and PPAF-III from the plasma ofH. diomphalia as shown in Fig.1 A. During dextran sulfate column chromatography, two fractions (Gr-1 and Gr-2) were specifically able to induce PO activity when both fractions and hemocyte lysate were incubated in the presence of Ca2+. However, PO activity could not be observed when hemocyte lysate was incubated with either Gr-1 or Gr-2 in the presence of Ca2+. Because the Gr-1 fractions contained activated PPAF-I, as determined by immunoblotting, it was likely that Gr-2 contained another proPO-activating factor(s) necessary for inducing PO activity. Therefore, we purified this factor by pooling Gr-2 fractions and then subjecting these to gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column followed by hydrophobic chromatography using a phenyl-Sepharose column. The active fractions showing PO activity were further purified by Mono-Q FPLC column chromatography. The purified protein ran as a single band under reducing and nonreducing conditions with molecular masses of 27 and 40 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1 B). This mobility pattern is similar to those of several other PPAFs (13Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,14Wang R. Lee S.Y. Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) where the mass of the purified PPAF is higher under nonreducing than reducing conditions; this suggests that disulfide bonding is responsible for the higher mass. In total, 56 μg of the purified 27-kDa protein, which we named prophenoloxidase-activating factor III (PPAF-III), was obtained from 33.6 g of H. diomphaliaplasma. To investigate the localization of the 27-kDa PPAF-III, we prepared plasma and hemocyte lysate from H. diomphalialarvae and analyzed them by Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified PPAF-III antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the purified PPAF-III antibody recognized a protein with an apparent mass of 40 kDa in plasma but not in hemocyte lysate. This result suggests that PPAF-III exists as a zymogen of about 40 kDa in plasma and that the purified 27-kDa PPAF-III is generated by a proteolytic cleavage from the zymogenic 40-kDa proPPAF-III. BothHolotrichia proPO-I and proPO-II contain an open reading frame of 2052 nucleotides corresponding to 684 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 79 kDa. The six chemically determined partial amino acid sequences of proPO-I and proPO-II coincide with the deduced amino acid sequences in the corresponding open reading frame. The amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that proPO-I and proPO-II show high sequence homology to other insect proPOs with highest identity, 60.5 and 72.8%, respectively, to M. sexta proPOs. The two copper binding regions containing the six conserved histidine residues of proPO-I and proPO-II are the most conserved regions among all insect proPOs as well as in arthropod hemocyanins (Fig.2). Both of the HolotrichiaproPOs contain an Arg–Phe sequence motif around residues 51–52, which is also present in other insect proPOs (indicated by anarrow), and this has been determined to be the cleavage site in both B. mori (22Kawabata T. Yasuhara Y. Ochiai M. Matsuura S. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7774-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and M. sexta (23Hall M. Scott T. Sugumaran M. Söderhäll K. Law J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7764-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Also, proPOs from H. diomphalia and M. sexta have two other interesting putative cleavage sites for serine proteases (indicated by arrowheads), namely Arg162–Ala163 from Hd-proPO-I and Ms-proPO-I, Gln163–Ala164 motif from Hd-proPO-II and Ms-proPO, respectively. However, this motif was not observed inB. mori or Anopheles gambiae proPO. To determine the complete amino acid sequence of the purified PPAF-III, we screened the cDNA library of H. diomphalia larvae with a degenerate DNA probe. The cDNA of proPPAF-III contains an open reading frame of 1053 nucleotides corresponding to 351 amino acid residues with a predicted mass of 37,900 Da (Fig.3). This result suggests that the proPPAF-III exists as a zymogen of 40 kDa in plasma and that the purified PPAF-III (27 kDa) is generated by a proteolytic cleavage from the zymogenic proPPAF-III. The six peptides of the PPAF-III in which the amino acid sequences were chemically determined were present in the deduced amino acid sequence. The apparent mass of proPPAF-III on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (40 kDa) is slightly larger than the deduced sequence (37.9 kDa), which may be explained by the fact that the native protein has undergone some post-translational events. The proPPAF-III has two domains, an amino-terminal domain and a catalytic domain. The hydrophobic first 19 amino acids of the amino-terminal end of the protein probably constitute a signal peptide with a putative cleavage site between Ala13 and Ile14 (24von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). One putative clip motif is present in the amino-terminal domain of the protein (Fig. 3, closed circles). The putative catalytic domain, Val97–Val351, is characteristic of trypsin-like serine proteases (arrow), as is the presence of His142, Asp204, and Ser299 residues in the catalytic sites (stars). The six-cysteine residues (diamonds) that form three disulfide bridges in most serine proteases are present and their positions are also conserved in proPPAF-III. The deduced amino acid sequence of theHolotrichia proPPAF-III (Hd-PPAF-III) was similar toTachypleus proclotting enzyme (Tt-PCE, 29.3%) (25Muta T. Hashimoto R. Miyata T. Nishimura H. Toy Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22426-22433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),Holotrichia PPAF-I (Hd-PPAF-I, 44.5%) (9Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), M. sexta proPO activating enzyme (Ms-PPAE, 40.6%) (12Jiang H. Wang Y. Kanost M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12220-12225Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), B. mori-proPO activating enzyme (Bm-PPAE, 34.1%) (13Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), crayfishP. leniusculus proPO activating enzyme (Pl-PPAE, 35.2%) (14Wang R. Lee S.Y. Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and D. melanogaster easter (Dm-easter, 36.6%) (11Chasan R. Anderson K. Cell. 1989; 56: 391-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In conclusion, PPAF-III has a serine protease domain at the carboxyl terminus and a single clip motif in the amino terminus (Fig. 3). However, the biological function of this clip motif has not yet been determined, whereas the clip motif in P. leniusculus PPAE has been demonstrated to act as a defensin-like peptide (14Wang R. Lee S.Y. Cerenius L. Söderhäll K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). When PPAF-III was incubated with the purified Holotrichia proPOs, the active forms of PPAF-I and proPPAF-II, generation of PO activity was shown to be dependent on Ca2+ (column 9 in Fig.4 A) because incubation without Ca2+ failed to induce PO activity (column 8). All other combinations also failed to induce PO activity (Fig.4 A). These results suggest that PPAF-III and Ca2+ are necessary for the triggering of PO activity in the Holotrichia proPO system. Because purified PPAF-I and PPAF-III have serine protease domains, it is possible that these factors can cleave proPOs and proPPAF-II (a masquerade-like protein without protease activity). We examined several molar ratios of PPAF-III or PPAF-I to the proPOs, such as 0.05:1, 0.1:1, 0.5:1, and 1:1, with constant amount of PPAF-II present (data not shown). When we used small amounts of protease, a longer incubation time was required to induce PO activity. Therefore, to observe PO activity more rapidly, we used excess amounts of proteases. We first examined the cleavage pattern by incubating these purified factors as shown in Fig. 4 B. When PPAF-I and proPPAF-II, or PPAF-I and PPAF-III, were incubated in the presence of Ca2+, there was no cleavage of proPPAF-II, because neither of these factors had changed their mobility (lanes 4and 5). In contrast, if proPPAF-II and PPAF-III were incubated with or without Ca2+, the 55-kDa proPPAF-II was cleaved to a 45-kDa PPAF-II, shown as band C in Fig.4 B (lanes 6 and 7). When PPAF-I, proPPAF-II, and PPAF-III were incubated in the presence or absence of Ca2+, proPPAF-II was still the only factor that was cleaved (lanes 8 and 9). To determine the specific cleavage site of the 55-kDa proPPAF-II, the amino-terminal sequence of the generated 45-kDa protein was determined to be ENANEXESYL. This sequence perfectly matches that of Glu100–Leu109 in PPAF-II, as shown in Fig.4 D-1. This result suggests that PPAF-III can specifically cleave proPPAF-II regardless of whether Ca2+ is present. Second, we studied the cleavage pattern of the twoHolotrichia proPOs and the three PPAFs by performingin vitro reconstitution experiments as shown in Fig.4 C. The two purified Holotrichia proPOs have one band with a mass of 79 kDa on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (lane 1). However, when proPOs and PPAF-I were incubated with or without Ca2+, a new 76-kDa protein band (indicated as band A) was generated from the 79-kDa protein, and this 76-kDa protein has no PO activity (lanes 2 and3). To confirm this cleavage by PPAF-I, we determined the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the generated 76-kDa band as shown in Fig. 4 D-2. The two resulting amino acid sequences from the 76-kDa band were FGEETKSKIP and FGEDDSETVT, which perfectly matched the Arg50–Phe51 and Arg51–Phe52 cleavage sites ofHolotrichia proPO-I and proPO-II, respectively. This result shows that purified PPAF-I specifically cleaves the 79-kDa proPO-I and proPO-II into two 76-kDa proteins between the two Arg–Phe motif sites. Interestingly, the two 76-kDa proteins do not show any PO activity, whereas other insect proPOs, if cleaved by a prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme at Arg-Phe motif, will exhibit PO activity (22Kawabata T. Yasuhara Y. Ochiai M. Matsuura S. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7774-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 23Hall M. Scott T. Sugumaran M. Söderhäll K. Law J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7764-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). When proPOs were incubated with proPPAF-II and Ca2+, PPAF-III with Ca2+, or PPAF-III without Ca2+, the 76-kDa protein band was not generated from the 79-kDa proPOs, clearly demonstrating that only PPAF I is involved in cleaving the two zymogenic 79-kDa proPOs into the two 76-kDa zymogenic POs. When proPOs, PPAF-I, and proPPAF-II were incubated with Ca2+ (lane 7), or when proPOs, PPAF-I and PPAF-III were incubated with Ca2+ (lane 8), the 76-kDa protein was generated from 79-kDa proPOs but still without PO activity. In contrast, when proPOs, proPPAF-II, and PPAF-III were incubated without or with Ca2+, the 76-kDa band A was not generated from the 79-kDa proPOs. These results suggest that PPAF-II and PPAF-III do not have any effect on the specific cleavage of 79-kDa proPOs. However, proPPAF-II (55 kDa) is specifically cleaved to PPAF-II (45 kDa, band C) by PPAF-III, as described in Fig.4 B. The amino-terminal sequence of band C was determined as ENANEXESYL. This sequence perfectly coincides with Glu100–Leu109 of PPAF-II (Fig. 4 D, 1). Finally, we mixed the proPOs and all three factors without and with Ca2+present. Surprisingly, the 76-kDa band A and a new 60-kDa band B were generated after a 20-min incubation in the presence of Ca2+(lane 12 in Fig. 4 C). This 60-kDa band B could not be generated in the absence of Ca2+(lane 11 in Fig. 4 C). PO activity of the reaction mixture was also shown with Ca2+ present, and no activity could be detected without Ca2+. The amino-terminal sequence of band B was determined to be AREEATLVPE, which corresponds to Arg162–Glu172 of the proPO-I sequence (Fig.4 D, 3). These results demonstrate that 79-kDa proPO-I has been cleaved into a 76-kDa proPO-I by PPAF-I and then this 76-kDa proPO-I was cleaved to 60-kDa PO-I by a joint action of the activated serine protease(s) and Ca2+. In this study, we show for the first time that several proPO-activating enzymes and other factors are necessary to activate proPOs in H. diomphalia. Based on these results, we propose aHolotrichia proPO activation cascade as shown in Fig.5. At present, the upstream part of this proPO cascade is poorly understood. For instance, we do not know how LPS, peptidoglycan, or β-1,3-glucan recognition proteins induce the activation of prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme(s) or other factor(s). The downstream part of the Holotrichia proPO system is quite complex and involves limited proteolysis of several factors and proPOs. An easter-type serine protease, PPAF-I, cleaves the 79-kDa zymogenic proPO-I and -II to two 76-kDa proPO proteins, still without any PO activity. Then another easter-type serine protease, PPAF-III, cleaves the 55-kDa zymogen proPPAF-II to 45-kDa PPAF-II, and finally the 76-kDa proPO-I generated by PPAF-I is cleaved to an active 60-kDa PO by serine protease in the presence of Ca2+.

Söderhäll K Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 363-373Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and their colleagues published studies on the biochemical characterization of proPO-activating enzymes. Furthermore, they proposed early on a proPO activation cascade in arthropods (for review see Refs. 1Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar-2). Recently, Kanost and colleague (28Yu X.-Q. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37373-37381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) reported that a C-type lectin,M. sexta immunolectin-2, which binds to bacterial LPS, is also involved in proPO activation. It still remains to be elucidated in detail how the connection between the upstream and downstream parts of the proPO cascade is organized and activated, but our experiments reported here provide a more detailed study of the activation of two different proPOs and their activating factors."

Degradation is dependent on sequences conserved in a destruction box motif. Overexpression of nondegradable cyclin B3 blocks the mitotic cell cycle in late anaphase, and at higher doses it can interfere with progression through G1 and entry into S phase. H. sapiens cyclin B3 mRNA and protein are detected readily in developing germ cells in the human testis and not in any other tissue.

Originally cloned from a chicken cDNA library, cyclin B3 is expressed at very low levels in virally transformed hematopoietic cell lines and early embryonic stages of chicken. When Gallus gallus cyclin B3 is expressed in HeLa cells, it is nuclear, interacts with cdk2 and cdc2, and is associated with a modest histone H1 kinase activity (15Gallant P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, cyclin B3 is expressed in both mitotic and meiotic cells. In mitotic cells, it is only required when either cyclin A or cyclin B1 is absent. Its abundance is down-regulated during the metaphase to anaphase transition, following degradation of cyclin B1 (16Jacobs H.W. Knoblich J.A. Lehner C.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a nondegradable cyclin B3 is associated with chromatin decondensation defects at the end of mitosis (17Parry D.H. O'Farrell P.H. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cyclin B3 is essential for fertility; but unlike cyclin B1 deficiency, infertility of cyclin B3-deficient flies is restricted to the female germ line and does not appear to involve defects in ovary structure or in meiosis I entry (16Jacobs H.W. Knoblich J.A. Lehner C.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We report the cloning of a full-length human cyclin B3 cDNA and a partial mouse cyclin B3 cDNA. Like the previously described chicken and Drosophila homologs, when mammalian cyclin B3 expression is enforced in mitotic cells, it is nuclear, is degraded upon anaphase entry following cyclin B1 degradation, and it is a poor activator of cdk2 kinase. We could not detect endogenous cyclin B3 in cell lines from a wide variety of cell types. In contrast, we readily observed cyclin B3 mRNA and protein in prepachytene spermatocytes, specifically during the leptotene and zygotene stages, and in nests of female oocytes during embryonic development. To our knowledge, this is the first cyclin to be placed specifically into this important developmental window during both male and female meiosis. The sequence data for the human cyclin B3 cDNA, mouse cyclin B3 cDNA, and L23 BAC have been submitted to the GenBank data base under the accession numbers AJ416458, AJ416459, and AJ416884–6, respectively. We generated and purified our own human cyclin B3 antibody based on procedures we described previously (18Koff A. Cross F. Fisher A. Schumacher J. Leguellec K. Philippe M. Roberts J.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1217-1228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment of cyclin B3 spanning amino acids 997–1395 was cloned into pGEX-5X (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant protein was purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and used as antigen. A bacterially expressed cyclin B3 (amino acids 997–1395) tagged with His6 at the C terminus was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Sigma) and used to affinity purify the antibody. We also used antibodies to cdk2 (M2, Santa Cruz), cdc2 (A12, Santa Cruz), and mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in the course of this work. In vitrotranscription and translation reactions were performed as prescribed by the manufacturer (Promega). For producing transcripts encoding cyclin B3 and cyclin B1 the full-length cDNAs were cloned into pCITE1 from pSPORT1-GW4 (InCyte) and pGEM-cyclin B1 (19Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), respectively. All immunoprecipitations were carried out in Nonidet P-40 radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 0.3 mmvanadate). H1 kinase assays have been described previously (20Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). To produce fluorescently labeled cyclin B3, the cDNA was cloned into pEGFP-C3 or pEYFP-C3 (Clontech). To generate the destruction box mutant (pEGFP-C3–3XA), mutations R60A, F63A, and N68A were introduced into the pEGFP- C3-cyclin B3 construct by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). HeLa cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were synchronized in G2 phase by a thymidine/aphidicolin block as described previously (19Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The plasmids pEGFP-C3-cyclin B3, pEYFP-C3-cyclin B3, pEGFP-C3–3XA, and ECFP-N1-cyclin B1 (a gift from Anja Hagting) were diluted in 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8) to 50 ng/μl for microinjection. Microinjection and time-lapse differential interference contrast fluorescence microscopy were performed as described previously (21Clute P. Pines J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry, 7-μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissues were prepared from testis, adrenal glands, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, thyroid, brain, and ovary. Sections were stained as described previously (14Liu D. Matzuk M.M. Sung W.K. Guo Q. Wang P. Wolgemuth D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 22Cordon-Cardo C.

As negative controls, preimmune rabbit serum, a mouse monoclonal antibody (Serotec), or purified rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used at the same dilution. RNA in situ hybridization on mouse testis was performed on 8-μm paraffin sections as described previously (23Manova K. Nocka K. Besmer P. Bachvarova R.F. Development. 1990; 110: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Manova K. Tomihara-Newberger C. Wang S. Godelman A. Kalantry S. Witty-Blease K., De Leon V. Chen W.S. Lacy E. Bachvarova R.F. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 293-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After deacetylation, sections were hybridized at 65 °C. Probes were generated with T7 or T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 12 μm cold UTP and 4 μm[33P]UTP. Autoradiographic detection was performed after 2 weeks of exposure. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin. Both the sense and antisense probe contained sequences from nucleotide 1 to 429 of the 972 nucleotides in the partial mouse cDNA. This represents the coding portion of the transcript. RNA in situ hybridization on human tissues was performed as described previously (22Cordon-Cardo C. Koff A. Drobnjak M. Capodieci P. Osman I. Millard S.S. Gaudin P.B. Fazzari M. Zhang Z.F. Massague J. Scher H.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1284-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Tissue sections from testis, adrenal glands, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, thyroid, brain, and ovary were prepared both as individual slides containing tissue pairs and as part of a multitissue array. Slides were hybridized at 42 °C overnight to the sense probe and antisense probes (nucleotides 4082–4424). Multiple tissue Northern blots with human or mouse adult tissues were obtained commercially (Clontech). In the course of screening a cDNA library for p27-interacting proteins, we identified a clone we labeled HMG1.1. It contained an open reading frame (ORF) homologous in a 270–290-amino acid region containing a cyclin box motif to cyclin B3, previously identified in chicken, flies, and worms. To obtain a full-length cDNA, we screened a testis cDNA library and searched data bases for end sequence-tagged clones with additional 5′-coding sequences. Compiling these results, we determined that full-length human cyclin B3 cDNA encoded an ORF of 1,395 amino acids, corresponding to a protein of 125 kDa (Fig.1 A). HMG1.1 was encoded in the region spanned from nucleotide 3119 to 4540 of this cDNA. While we were preparing our manuscript, a cDNA from pooled Wilms tumors (GenBank accession no. AI733558) encoding a full-length ORF was identified, and Lozano and colleagues (25Lozano J.C. Perret E. Schatt P. Arnould C. Peaucellier G. Picard A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) identified a full-length transcript encoding an identical ORF. A cyclin B3 cDNA was also isolated as a cdk5-binding protein in a two-hybrid screen. 2H. Zhang, Yale University, personal communication. There were two highly conserved regions among cyclin B3 proteins from different organisms (Fig. 1 A). Similarities were restricted to the termini and included a putative destruction box motif of the RXXFXXXXN type at the N terminus (human amino acids 60–68) and a cyclin box motif (human amino acids 1160–1245) at the C terminus (Fig. 1 A). TheCaenorhabditis elegans sequence lacked similarity at the N terminus. The significance, if any, of the nonconserved region in the middle of the protein is not clear. As noted during the cloning of the chicken homolog (15Gallant P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), human cyclin B3 was most similar to cyclins of the A and B types (Fig. 1 B). We examined the ability of human cyclin B3 to form complexes with and activate cdk2 and cdc2. Because the full-length protein was predicted to be considerably larger than chicken andDrosophila cyclin B3, we also tested HMG1.1, which encoded a 55-kDa C-terminal fragment of cyclin B3 including the cyclin box. We individually expressed human cyclin B3, HMG1.1, or human cyclin B1 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and assayed the cdk immunoprecipitates from these lysates for associated cyclin and histone H1 kinase activity (Fig. 2). Full-length cyclin B3 translated at its predicted molecular mass of 120 kDa, HMG1.1 translated at 55 kDa, and cyclin B1 at 60 kDa, respectively (Fig.2 A). cdk2-associated kinase activity was detected in lysate programmed with cyclin B1 mRNA but not in lysate programmed with cyclin B3 or HMG1.1 (Fig. 2 B). Similar amounts of cdk2 were precipitated from the lysates, and nearly equimolar amounts of cyclin were coprecipitated. cdc2-associated kinase activity was apparent in cyclin B1-programmed lysate but not in lysate programmed with full-length cyclin B3 or HMG1.1. cdc2 was precipitated in similar amounts from the different lysates, and the lack of activity correlated with the failure to coprecipitate cyclin B3 or HMG1.1 (Fig. 2 B). No significant H1 kinase activity was immunoprecipitated with a mock antibody from any lysate or with cdk antibodies from unprogrammed lysate. Similar cdk interactions and an absence of histone H1 kinase activity were seen when either the GST-HMG1.1 fusion protein or a protein produced in baculovirus-infected cells was incubated with extracts from exponentially growing HeLa cells, MANCA cells, or testes prepared from adult mice, and complexes isolated on glutathione-agarose (negative data not shown). Reciprocally, immunoprecipitation of cyclin B3 with an affinity-purified antibody coprecipitated cdk2 from cyclin B3- but not cyclin B1-programmed lysates (Fig. 2 C). These precipitates did not have histone H1 kinase activity (data not shown). This antibody did not cross-react with cyclin B1 (Fig. 2 C). A mock antibody did not precipitate cdk2, cyclin B3, or cyclin B1. The affinity-purified cyclin B3 antibody did not react with recombinant cyclins A, D1, D2, D3, and E produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (data not shown). We conclude that human cyclin B3 can bind efficiently to cdk2 but not cdc2; however, it was unable to induce H1 kinase activity. We next examined the localization of human cyclin B3 tagged with GFP in mitotic cells. Nuclear accumulation of fluorescence was observed for an N-terminal GFP fusion protein (GFP-WT) in HeLa cells (Fig.3 A). Equivalent results were obtained with 293T and MDA468 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, C-terminal GFP-tagged protein accumulated in the cytosol (Fig.3 A). YFP and CFP have distinct fluorescence emission spectra, allowing the simultaneous detection of two proteins (26Ellenberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Presley J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Coinjection of vectors expressing cyclin B1-CFP and YFP-B3 showed that in interphase cells marked by cytoplasmic accumulation of cyclin B1, cyclin B3 accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 3 B). Endogenous cyclin B3 protein accumulated in the nucleus of human spermatocytes in testis (see Fig. 7 A), suggesting that nuclear localization was likely to be more physiologic.Figure 7Human cyclin B3 protein is expressed in developing male germ cells. Tissue sections were prepared, mounted on a tissue array, and stained with cyclin B3 antibody as described under “Materials and Methods.” Reactive protein was detected by peroxidase reaction (45Brown N.R.

These are representative fields from at least three different experiments. Negative staining in the brain, lung, thymus, and spleen on the array is not shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined whether human cyclin B3 was degraded during mitosis. We injected G2 phase HeLa cells with an N-terminally tagged GFP- or YFP- cyclin B3 expression construct and monitored the fluorescence in single cells during real time mitosis. In mitosis, cells typically completed metaphase alignment (designatedt = 0) 33–36 min after nuclear envelope breakdown and initiated telophase movements 15–18 min afterward (data not shown). In several experiments, fluorescence associated with injection of wild-type cyclin B3 in single cells began to decline in late metaphase and declined rapidly shortly after entering into anaphase (half-maximally at ∼9 min) (Fig.4 A), suggesting that human cyclin B3 is destroyed over the metaphase to anaphase transition. Next using cells injected with a pair of YFP-B3 and B1-CFP constructs, we defined the timing of cyclin B3 degradation relative to cyclin B1 degradation. Most B1-CFP/YFP-B3-expressing cells underwent a seemingly normal mitosis and began to destroy B1-CFP at the start of metaphase (more than half-maximal at t = 0) (Fig. 4 B). In these cells, YFP-B3 degradation, both the onset and the half-maximal timing, occurred roughly 12 min after B1-CFP degradation (Fig.4 B). Triple alanine substitution in the destruction box motif (R60A/F63A/N68A, the 3XA mutant) prevented the decrease in cyclin B3-associated fluorescence after completion of anaphase B (Fig.4 A, right, cells 1 and 2). Fluorescence of wild-type cyclin B3 was reduced by 78 ± 5% (mean ± S.D.) from the metaphase amount at this time (Fig. 4 A,left). This indicated that mitotic destruction of cyclin B3 was dependent on the destruction box sequence. To determine whether the expression of cyclin B3 would affect cell cycle progression, we cotransfected 293T cells with increasing amounts of vectors encoding cyclin B3 and GFP and examined the distribution of cells in each phase of the cycle by flow cytometry 36 h later using a FloJo4 analysis platform. Cyclin B3 expression did not significantly affect the cell cycle distribution at any amount (Fig. 5 A and TableI). On the other hand, cells transfected with 5 μg of cyclin B3XA expression vector accumulated in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and those transfected with 10 μg of cyclin B3XA expression vector accumulated in both G2/M and G1 (Table I). As expected, cyclin B3 did not accumulate to the amounts of cyclin B3XA (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that accumulated cyclin B3 might accelerate progression through S, inhibit progression through G2, or inhibit mitotic exit, and at very high levels might even retard the G1 to S transition.Table ICell cycle phase distribution of transfected cellsDNAAmountG1SG2μgGFP2142535519323310193232Cyclin B352031331019323220182634Cyclin B3XA11927262.513333151475510*46046Cell cycle phase distribution was determined by the Dean-Jett-Foxx model except where indicated by an asterisk (Watson Pragmatic model used) using a Flo-Jo 4.0 platform. Open table in a new tab Cell cycle phase distribution was determined by the Dean-Jett-Foxx model except where indicated by an asterisk (Watson Pragmatic model used) using a Flo-Jo 4.0 platform. Because cyclin B3 exerts effects on the G2/M population at lower doses, we chose to address the effects of cyclin B3 expression on G2 progression and mitotic exit. To accomplish this we injected plasmids expressing either GFP-cyclin B3 or the nondegradable mutant into G2-synchronized cells. Four fields were imaged 2 h later and scored for mitotic GFP-positive cells. Mitotic cells are easily identifiable by their rounded morphologic appearance (e.g. see Fig. 5 C). 0 of 48 cyclin B3-expressing cells were mitotic; however, 22 of 30 cells expressing the nondegradable mutant were. This suggests that accumulation of cyclin B3 might trigger premature mitotic entry. We then looked 8 h later, a time at which some noninjected cells would progress through G2, divide, and enter G1 (Fig. 5 C). In two separate experiments, very few cells expressing cyclin B3 were in M phase (7 of 99 and 1 of 71), and those were in anaphase. All other cells were in G1 or G2. In contrast, in two experiments with cells expressing the nondegradable mutant, 70 of 85 and 39 of 55 were arrested in mitosis. The vast majority of these were in anaphase, with only 11 of 70 or 10 of 39 in metaphase or past the point of cleavage furrow ingression. These observations indicate that accumulated cyclin B3 can trigger premature mitotic entry and inhibit progression from M to G1 by arresting or delaying cells in anaphase. These observations might reflect bona fide functions of cyclin B3 or be the result of cyclin B3 interfering with the normal regulation of mitotic events. Consequently, it was important to identify the cell types in which cyclin B3 was usually expressed. We next examined the expression of human cyclin B3 sequences in normal human tissues. Using a probe from the 3′-conserved region (nucleotides 4082–4424) and two probes from the nonconserved sequences (nucleotides 404–1129 and 3133–3416) (Fig.6 A), we detected an abundant signal only in testis by Northern analysis of mRNA prepared from adult tissues (Fig. 6 B). While this manuscript was in preparation, similar Northern results were reported for different N- and C-terminal probes (25Lozano J.C. Perret E. Schatt P. Arnould C. Peaucellier G. Picard A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These signals were only apparent as a single 5 kb band, suggesting that the B3 probe sequences might be contiguous. To demonstrate this more directly, we performed reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays (P1, P2, P3, P4) using overlapping primer sets (Fig. 6 A) and were able to amplify products of the appropriate size and sequence from testis mRNA (Fig.6 C). As a control for the same reverse transcriptase reactions, PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplified similar yields from testis and thymus mRNA, at different amounts of template (Fig. 6 C and data not shown). This result is in marked contrast to that of Lozano and colleagues (25Lozano J.C. Perret E. Schatt P. Arnould C. Peaucellier G. Picard A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) who reported mRNA in other tissues after two rounds of nested RT-PCR. However, our single round PCR protocol was sufficient to detect a single copy of cDNA per cell, and we were unable to detect cyclin B3 in thymus. It is possible that the mRNA was cell type-specific; however, we were unable to detect any in situ hybridization signals in multiple organs listed under “Materials and Methods” (negative data not shown). We screened a number of cell lines for cyclin B3 mRNA and protein. We could not detect cyclin B3 mRNA or protein in exponentially growing MDA468 (breast epithelial), HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), K-562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia), MANCA (B cell), SW480 (colon), A549 (lung), G361 (melanoma), G401 (embryonic kidney), or NT2/d1 (fibroblast-like embryonal carcinoma) cells (negative data not shown). We observed a weak signal after RT-PCR in HeLa cells, consistent with our cDNA library screen, but we could not detect the mRNA by Northern or the protein by immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, or immunofluorescence (data not shown). Thus, the normal expression of cyclin B3 mRNA was highly restricted to the testis, suggesting that it may have a tissue-specific role in mammals. The restricted expression of mRNA in the tissue Northern blot and our inability to detect it in many different cell lines suggested that cyclin B3 may have a cell type-specific function. The normal human testis contains four predominant cell types: Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, germ cells, and supporting fibroblast-like cells; consequently, we looked for the cell type(s) that express cyclin B3. We detected cyclin B3 protein in the nucleus only in a subset of cells inside the periphery of seminiferous tubules (Fig.7, A and B). No specific staining was observed in the region between tubules, suggesting that cyclin B3 was not expressed abundantly in Leydig cells and other cells located in the interstitial region. Sections from liver, pancreas (Fig. 7, C and D), and other tissues on the array (data not shown, listed under “Materials and Methods”) were not reactive with the cyclin B3 antibody. Morphology was used to determine whether cyclin B3 was expressed in intratubular germ cells or Sertoli cells (Fig. 7 B,inset). Sertoli cells have an elongated nuclei, an easily discernible single nucleolus, and proximity to the periphery of tubules (27Clermont Y. Russell L.D. Griswold M.D. The Sertoli Cell. Cache River Press, Clearwater, FL1993: 305-330Google Scholar). Sertoli cells recognizable by these criteria were negative for cyclin B3 staining. A similar expression pattern was seen with cyclin B3 mRNA, which was detected at the periphery of intratubular cells in testis sections (Fig. 8, A andB). Sense probes were negative (Fig. 8, C andD). No mRNA was detected in any other tissues on the array (negative data not shown; organs are listed under “Materials and Methods”). This suggests that cyclin B3 was expressed in the germ cells of the adult human testis. Because the staging of spermatogenesis is more defined in the mouse, we wanted to examine the expression of cyclin B3 in mouse testis. However, our cDNA probes and antibodies to human cyclin B3 do not recognize mouse RNA and protein, respectively. Therefore we first identified cyclin B3-related mouse genomic sequences in a single BAC clone by nucleic acid hybridization, and we used these to derive sequences for primers to amplify an RT-PCR product from mouse testis. Ultimately, we isolated a cDNA by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR, which we named TR. The TR cDNA encoded a single ORF of 238 amino acids which was highly similar to the C terminus (amino acids 1153–1295) of human cyclin B3 (70% identity). This mouse cDNA and genomic sequences mapped to a region of the X chromosome XA2-A3 (data not shown) which was syntenic with the region Xp11.22–11.23 (28Willard H.F. Durfy S.J. Mahtani M.M. Dorkins H. Davies K.E. Williams B.R. Hum. Genet. 1989; 81: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), where human cyclin B3 was mapped (25Lozano J.C. Perret E. Schatt P. Arnould C. Peaucellier G. Picard A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During the first wave of mouse spermatogenesis, tubules progress through the different stages of meiosis in a fairly synchronous fashion. mRNA expression was not detected at day 7.5 (data not shown). Rare tubules were positive at D8.5 (Fig.9) and increased in frequency from day 9.5 (Fig. 9) through day 12.5 (data not shown). Many of these signals localized to cells at the center of the positive tubules. At the same time, no expression was detected in histologically undeveloped tubules that contained only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells."

The molecular motion that causes the excess electron solvation is manifested as a dynamic shift in the electronic energy. Although the initially excited electron is delocalized in the plane of the interface, interactions with the adsorbate can lead to its localization. A method for determining the spatial extent of the localized electron in the plane of the interface has been developed. This spatial extent was measured to be on the order of a single adsorbate molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1525378600,"Platelet activation is a complex process induced by a variety of stimuli, which act in concert to ensure the rapid formation of a platelet plug at places of vascular injury. We show here that fibrillar collagen, which initiates platelet activation at the damaged vessel wall, activates only a small fraction of platelets in suspension directly, whereas the majority of platelets becomes activated by mediators released from collagen-activated platelets. In Gαq-deficient platelets that do not respond with activation of integrin αIIbβ3 to a variety of mediators like thromboxane A2 (TXA2), thrombin, or ADP, collagen at high concentrations was able to induce aggregation, an effect that could be blocked by antagonists of the TXA2 or P2Y12 receptors. The activation of TXA2 or P2Y12 receptors alone, which in Gαq-deficient platelets couple to G12/G13 and Gi, respectively, did not induce platelet integrin activation or aggregation. However, concomitant activation of both receptors resulted in irreversible integrin αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation of Gαq-deficient platelets. Thus, the activation of G12/G13- and Gi-mediated signaling pathways is sufficient to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Although Gq-mediated signaling plays an important role in platelet activation, it is not strictly required for the activation of integrin αIIbβ3. This indicates that the efficient induction of platelet aggregation through G-protein-coupled receptors is an integrated response mediated by various converging G-protein-mediated signaling pathways involving Gq and Gi as well as G12/G13. Platelet activation is a complex process induced by a variety of stimuli, which act in concert to ensure the rapid formation of a platelet plug at places of vascular injury. We show here that fibrillar collagen, which initiates platelet activation at the damaged vessel wall, activates only a small fraction of platelets in suspension directly, whereas the majority of platelets becomes activated by mediators released from collagen-activated platelets. In Gαq-deficient platelets that do not respond with activation of integrin αIIbβ3 to a variety of mediators like thromboxane A2 (TXA2), thrombin, or ADP, collagen at high concentrations was able to induce aggregation, an effect that could be blocked by antagonists of the TXA2 or P2Y12 receptors. The activation of TXA2 or P2Y12 receptors alone, which in Gαq-deficient platelets couple to G12/G13 and Gi, respectively, did not induce platelet integrin activation or aggregation. However, concomitant activation of both receptors resulted in irreversible integrin αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation of Gαq-deficient platelets. Thus, the activation of G12/G13- and Gi-mediated signaling pathways is sufficient to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Although Gq-mediated signaling plays an important role in platelet activation, it is not strictly required for the activation of integrin αIIbβ3. This indicates that the efficient induction of platelet aggregation through G-protein-coupled receptors is an integrated response mediated by various converging G-protein-mediated signaling pathways involving Gq and Gi as well as G12/G13. thromboxane A2 thromboxane B2 forward/side scatter Under normal conditions, platelets circulate freely in the blood and do not adhere to each other. At sites of vascular damage, however, platelets adhere to subendothelial surfaces and become activated. Platelet activation involves a rapid change of shape followed by degranulation and integrin αIIbβ3-mediated aggregation. The activation of platelets is induced by various extracellular stimuli and involves positive feedback loops, which in a complex process ensure the rapid formation of a platelet plug. Collagen, exposed at subendothelial surfaces at sites of vascular injury, induces platelet activation initially by binding to glycoprotein VI, which through the associated FcRγ chain signals in a G-protein-independent manner (1Watson S.P. Gibbins J. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 260-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Full platelet aggregation by collagen and subsequent recruitment of platelets into a growing platelet plug, however, requires the formation and release of mediators like thromboxane A2(TXA2)1 and ADP. The transmembrane receptors of TXA2 and ADP couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, which represent central mediators of platelet activation. TXA2 receptors couple to Gq and to G12/G13 (2Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 3Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), whereas ADP acts through two G-protein-coupled receptors, P2Y1, which couples to Gq, and P2Y12, which couples to Gi (4Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 5Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D., Li, G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Some of the roles of individual G-protein-mediated signaling pathways in platelet activation have been described during recent years. It is generally believed that Gq-mediated phospholipase Cβ activation plays an essential role in platelet activation as demonstrated by the phenotype of Gαq-deficient platelets, which fail to aggregate and secrete in response to thrombin, ADP, and the TXA2 mimetic U46619 because of a lack of agonist-induced phospholipase C activation (6Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of Gq-independent processes in the regulation of platelet activation emerged from studies describing the mechanism of ADP-induced platelet activation. Platelets deficient in P2Y1 or in which P2Y1 was blocked pharmacologically do not aggregate in response to low and intermediate concentrations of ADP (7Hechler B. Leon C. Vial C. Vigne P. Frelin C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. Blood. 1998; 92: 152-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Aggregation could be restored by serotonin, which induces Gq-mediated phospholipase C activation but alone is not able to induce platelet aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 9Savi P. Beauverger P. Labouret C. Delfaud M. Salel V. Kaghad M. Herbert J.M.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Platelet activation by ADP obviously requires an additional signal, which appears to be mediated by the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (5Hollopeter G. Jantzen H.-M. Vincent D., Li, G. England L. Ramakrishnan V. Yang R.-B. Nurden P. Nurden A. Julius D. Conley P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). Platelets deficient in P2Y12 or in which P2Y12was blocked did not aggregate in response to ADP unless the Gi-mediated pathway was activated by adrenaline, which itself is unable to induce platelet aggregation (8Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 12Foster C.J. Prosser D.M. Agans J.M. Zha I.Y. Smith M.D. Lachowicz J.E. Zhang F.L. Gustafson E. Monsma Jr., F.J. Wiekowski M.T. Abbondanzo S.J. Cook D.N. Bayne M.L. Lira S.A. Chintala M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus, Gq and Gi can synergize to induce platelet aggregation, and full platelet activation in response to ADP at intermediate concentrations requires concomitant activation of both G-proteins. G-proteins of the G12 family, G12 and G13, which are activated through TXA2 and thrombin receptors (2Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 3Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), have been involved in the induction of the platelet shape change. This is mainly based on the finding that in Gαq-deficient platelets in which TXA2receptors only couple to G12 and G13, U46619still induces a rapid shape change. This effect appears to be mediated by the Rho/Rho kinase pathway (3Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate a role for G12/G13-mediated signaling in platelet aggregation and show that in the absence of Gαq, TXA2, and ADP or adrenaline can induce integrin αIIbβ3-dependent platelet aggregation by concomitant activation of G12/G13 through TXA2 receptors and of Gi via P2Y12 or α2-adrenergic receptors, whereas each of the stimuli given alone was without effect. Thus, G12/G13-mediated as well as Gi-mediated signaling processes can synergize to activate the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Mutant mice deficient in Gαq were produced as described previously (6Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Gαq-deficient and wild-type littermates, which were of 129/Sv × C57BL/6 genetic background were used for experiments. The ATP analog AR-C69931MX was a generous gift from ASTRA Charnwood (Loughborough Leics, England). ADP, adrenaline, essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and human fibrinogen were from Sigma. The thromboxane analog U46619 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (Grünberg, Germany), and fibrillar type I collagen (Horm) from equine tendon was from Nycomed (Munich, Germany). The thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist SQ29548 was fromBiomol (Hamburg, Germany), and the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was kindly provided by Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. (Saitama, Japan). JON/APE, which selectively binds to activated mouse αIIbβ3 integrin (13Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Brockhoff G. Bier U. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), was produced and modified in our laboratory. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-P-selectin and control IgG antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Unlabeled JON/A was used to block αIIbβ3 in aggregometry as described previously (13Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Brockhoff G. Bier U. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mice were bled under ether anesthesia from the retroorbital plexus. Blood was collected in a tube containing 10% (v/v) 7.5 units/ml heparin, and platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Platelet-rich plasma was removed and centrifuged at 1570 × g for 10 min. The platelet pellet was washed twice in Tyrode's buffer (137 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter KCl, 12 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 0.3 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 5.5 mmol/liter glucose, 5 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.3) containing 0.35% bovine serum albumin and finally resuspended at a density of 5 × 105 platelet/μl in the same buffer in the presence of 0.02 units/ml ADP scavenger apyrase, a concentration sufficient to prevent desensitization of platelet ADP receptors during storage. Platelets were kept at 37 °C throughout all experiments. To block thromboxane A2 or P2Y12 receptors, platelets were incubated with 10 μm SQ29548 or 10 μm AR-C69931MX, respectively, for 10 min at 37 °C before the start of the experiment. To inhibit Rho kinase activity, platelets were incubated with Y-27632 (10 μm) for 30 min before the start of the experiment. To determine platelet aggregation, light transmission was measured using washed platelets adjusted to a platelet concentration of 3 × 105 platelets/μl with Tyrode's buffer containing CaCl2 (1 mm) and human fibrinogen (0.2 mg/ml). Transmission was recorded on a Fibrintimer 4-channel aggregometer (APACT Laborgeräte und Analysensysteme, Hamburg, Germany) and is expressed as arbitrary units with 100% transmission adjusted with plasma. Agonists were added as 20–100-fold concentrates. For determination of platelet degranulation, platelets were loaded with serotonin by incubation of platelet-rich plasma for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 μCi/ml [3H]serotonin (80–130 Ci/mmol). Thereafter, platelets were washed once in Tyrode's buffer, and platelets were adjusted at 2 × 105/ml. Platelets were exposed for 3 min to the indicated stimuli and chilled. After centrifugation, the secreted serotonin was determined by scintillation counting of the supernatants. TXB2 formation was determined using an enzyme immunoassay (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). 2.5 × 106 washed platelets were incubated for 3 min in the presence of the indicated stimuli. After centrifugation, TXB2 levels in supernatants were determined according to manufacturer's instructions. Washed platelets were adjusted to 2 × 104 platelets/μl with Tyrode's buffer, and 50 μl of this dilution were stimulated with the indicated agonists for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were then stained with fluorophore-labeled monoclonal antibodies for 10 min at room temperature and directly analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Pharmingen). Platelets were gated by forward/side scatter (FSC/SSC) characteristics. We have previously shown that Gαq-deficient platelets display defective activation by collagen (6Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) although primary signaling through the activating platelet collagen receptor, GPVI/FcRγ, is not affected by the absence of Gαq (14Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Eckly A. Schulte V. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J.P. Zirngibl H. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Blood. 2001; 97: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This may be because of the fact that fibrillar collagen is an insoluble macromolecule and, therefore, only a small fraction of platelets comes into direct contact with collagen (15Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D. Mokhtari-Nejad R. Lindhout T. Heemskerk J.W. Zirngibl H. Fassler R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), whereas the majority of platelets exposed to collagen may be activated secondarily by mediators like ADP and TXA2, which are released from the collagen-responsive fraction of platelets. To test this possibility, we performed flow cytometric analysis of single platelets in diluted suspensions under experimental conditions that largely exclude the accumulation of released mediators. Only 11% of the wild-type platelets were directly activated by collagen at high concentrations (50 μg/ml) as shown by the activation of αIIbβ3 using the JON/APEantibody (13Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Brockhoff G. Bier U. Zirngibl H. Nieswandt B. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and by degranulation-dependent exposure of P-selectin (Fig. 1). In contrast, >99% of platelets are activated upon exposure to stimuli like ADP and TXA2 under the same conditions (data not shown). The primary activation of a subpopulation of platelets by fibrillar collagen was not impaired in Gαq-deficient platelets of which also ∼11% responded to collagen. Thus, a small fraction of platelets is activated by collagen directly and subsequently releases soluble agonists like ADP, TXA2, and other mediators, which in turn activate the majority of platelets, resulting in the full aggregation response. This mechanism mediates not only collagen-induced activation of platelets in suspension as studied here but most probably also underlies the initial activation of platelets by subendothelial collagen at the damaged vessel wall in vivo. The amplification of collagen-induced platelet activation by mediators like ADP and TXA2 is thought to be largely Gq- dependent, because both ADP and TXA2 fail to induce platelet aggregation in the absence of Gαq (6Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we studied aggregation of Gαq-deficient platelets in response to increasing concentrations of fibrillar collagen. Although low concentrations of collagen did not induce aggregation of platelets in the absence of Gαq, collagen at concentrations of >10 μg/ml induced robust aggregation of Gαq-deficient platelets, which occurred with a pronounced shape change (as shown by the decrease in light transmission before the start of aggregation) (Fig.2 A). Whereas collagen was much less potent in Gαq-deficient platelets compared with wild-type platelets, the maximal efficacy appeared to be only moderately affected by the absence of Gq-mediated signaling. The aggregation of Gαq-deficient platelets in response to high collagen concentrations was accompanied by serotonin release and the formation of TXA2 (Fig. 2, B andC), whereas collagen at low concentrations was unable to induce significant release or formation of mediators in the absence of Gαq. These results suggested that soluble agonists released from collagen-activated platelets can induce shape change and aggregation in the absence of Gαq. In Gαq-deficient platelets, the receptors for ADP and TXA2 couple to Gi and G12/G13, respectively. Therefore, we studied the role of these signaling pathways in the overall process of platelet activation/aggregation. To test the significance of TXA2receptor-mediated activation of G12/G13 for the observed shape change and aggregation response in collagen-stimulated Gαq-deficient platelets, we inhibited the platelet TXA2 receptor by the specific antagonist SQ29548 (16Hedberg A. Hall S.E. Ogletree M.L. Harris D.N. Liu E.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 245: 786-792PubMed Google Scholar). As evaluated by light transmission, this treatment completely abolished the collagen-induced shape change of Gαq-deficient platelets (Fig. 2 D). Thus, the activation of G12/G13 through TXA2receptors plays a major role in this process. Unexpectedly, the inhibition of the TXA2 receptor also markedly reduced the aggregation response, suggesting that G12/G13stimulation is involved in the activation of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3. On the other hand, the inhibition of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor by the specific antagonist AR-C69931MX (10 μm) had no influence on the shape change but also abolished the aggregation response (Fig.2 D). The finding that both TXA2 and ADP are required for collagen-induced platelet aggregation in the absence of Gαq suggests that G12/G13- and Gi-mediated signaling pathways act in concert to activate integrin αIIbβ3. To study the role of G12/G13 in platelet integrin activation, we used the TXA2 mimetic U46619, which is known to specifically stimulate Gq and G12/G13 through the TXA2 receptor. As shown previously, U46619 induced a rapid shape change but no aggregation in Gαq-deficient platelets at concentrations up to 30 μm, whereas robust aggregation was already seen at 0.3 μm in wild-type platelets (Fig.3 A), confirming the crucial role of Gq in this process. U46619-induced aggregation of wild-type platelets has been shown to largely depend on released ADP acting on the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (17Paul B.Z. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29108-29114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the activation of Gq and G12/G13 is not sufficient to stimulate full integrin activation and, possibly, degranulation in platelets unless Gi is concomitantly activated. This was confirmed when we examined U46619-stimulated wild-type platelets by flow cytometry for activated αIIbβ3 integrin and P-selectin expression. U46619 at concentrations of up to 30 μminduced only very low levels of αIIbβ3activation and P-selectin expression in wild-type platelets (Fig.3 B). Thus, the activation of Gq and G12/G13 is indeed not sufficient for efficient integrin activation and granule release in platelets. However, the addition of low concentrations of exogenous ADP (5 μm) resulted in profound αIIbβ3 activation and P-selectin expression. At this concentration, ADP alone is known to induce only low levels of αIIbβ3 activation and no P-selectin expression in wild-type platelets, resulting in reversible platelet aggregation (Fig. 3 B) (4Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The potentiating effect of ADP was dependent on stimulation of the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor, because it was abrogated in the presence of the highly specific P2Y12 antagonist AR-C69931MX (10 μm). This finding suggested that the failure of Gαq-deficient platelets to aggregate in response to U46619 is not only because of the absence of the Gq-mediated pathway leading to inside-out activation of integrin αIIbβ3 but is also based on defective release of stored ADP and subsequent Giactivation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed αIIbβ3 activation on U46619-stimulated Gαq-deficient platelets in the absence or presence of exogenously added ADP. In these platelets, which do not degranulate in response to TXA2 receptor activation, U46619 alone did not induce αIIbβ3 activation at concentrations up to 30 μm (Fig. 3 C). Strikingly, however, weak but consistent activation of αIIbβ3was detectable upon the addition of 5 μm ADP, which by itself had no effect because of the lack of P2Y1-mediated calcium mobilization (18Ohlmann P. Eckly A. Freund M. Cazenave J.-P. Offermanns S. Gachet C Blood. 2000; 96: 2134-2139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to wild-type platelets, the potentiating effect of ADP was inhibited by the P2Y12antagonist AR-C69931MX (10 μm) (Fig. 3 C). The relatively low levels of αIIbβ3activation induced by U46619 and ADP in Gαq-deficient platelets were sufficient to mediate robust and irreversible aggregation that was inhibited by a blocking antibody against αIIbβ3 integrin (Fig. 3 D). Importantly, aggregation was also blocked in the presence of AR-C69931MX, confirming the critical role of the P2Y12receptor-mediated Gi activation in this process (Fig.3 D). Similar results were obtained when G12/G13 activation was induced by thrombin instead of U46619. Although thrombin (0.2 units/ml) alone induced shape change but no aggregation of Gαq-deficient platelets, robust αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation occurred in the presence of exogenously added ADP (5 μm). This potentiating effect of ADP was again inhibited by AR-C69931MX (10 μm) (data not shown). It is known that Gαq-deficient platelets do not aggregate in response to U46619 or ADP because of the lack of intracellular calcium mobilization (6Offermanns S. Toombs C.F., Hu, Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). To test whether the combination of both agonists would be able to bypass this defect by undefined mechanisms, we measured intracellular calcium levels in Gαq-deficient platelets in response to increasing concentrations of U46619 and ADP. However, although wild-type platelets responded with robust calcium mobilization to a combination of 1 μmU46619 and 5 μm ADP, no response was seen in Gαq-deficient platelets, even at 10 μmU46619 plus 50 μm ADP (data not shown). These results suggested that concomitant stimulation of G12/G13 and Gi results in integrin activation in platelets and that Gq is not necessarily required to induce platelet activation through G-protein-coupled receptors. To test this hypothesis further, we stimulated wild-type and Gαq-deficient platelets with U46619 in the absence or presence of the Gi-selective agonist, adrenaline. Adrenaline alone is unable to promote platelet shape change or aggregation (14Nieswandt B. Bergmeier W. Eckly A. Schulte V. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J.P. Zirngibl H. Offermanns S. Gachet C. Blood. 2001; 97: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Lanza F. Cazenave J.-P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) but can potentiate various platelet responses through Gi and the Gi family member Gz (20Yang J., Wu, J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9984-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Neither wild-type nor Gαq-deficient platelets responded to adrenaline (10 μm) with αIIbβ3 activation (Fig.4, A and C) or P-selectin expression (Fig. 4 C and data not shown), and consequently, no aggregation occurred (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Adrenaline (like ADP) potentiated the effect of U46619 in both mouse strains as shown by αIIbβ3 activation and P-selectin expression in wild-type (Fig. 4 C) and αIIbβ3 activation in Gαq-deficient platelets (Fig. 4 A). The αIIbβ3 activation observed in Gαq-deficient platelets in response to U46619 and adrenaline was sufficient to mediate irreversible platelet aggregation that was inhibited by a blocking antibody against the integrin (Fig.4 B). This finding demonstrates the critical involvement of both G12/G13 and Gi in full integrin activation and granule release in response to the TXA2 mimetic U46619 and indicates that activation of G12/G13- and Gi-mediated pathways is sufficient for platelet activation. Recent evidence suggests that the G12/G13-mediated platelet shape change response is mediated by the Rho/Rho kinase pathway (3Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 21Paul B.Z. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28293-28300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 22Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, the TXA2-dependent shape change of Gαq-deficient platelets in response to high collagen concentrations was abolished in the presence of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (10 μm) (23Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, however, the inhibition of Rho kinase had no significant influence on the aggregation response, indicating that G12/G13activation contributes to integrin activation by regulating a Rho kinase-independent mechanism (Fig.5 A). To test this hypothesis, we activated Gαq-deficient platelets with U46619 alone or in combination with ADP or adrenaline in the absence or presence of Y-27632 (10 μm). Indeed, whereas the inhibition of Rho kinase abrogated the shape change induced by U46619, it had no effect on αIIbβ3 activation (Fig. 5 B) and platelet aggregation (Fig. 5 C). Similarly, inhibitors of non-receptor tyrosine kinases like src, which have been shown to be activated through G12/G13 in platelets (3Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G. Offermanns S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), had no effect on the activation of Gαq-deficient platelets in response to U46619 and ADP (data not shown). The mechanisms linking the G12/G13-mediated signaling pathway to integrin αIIbβ3 activation in platelets remains unclear. To test the significance of the synergy between G12/G13- and Gi-mediated signaling in normal platelets, we stimulated wild-type platelets with 0.03 μmU46619 in the presence or absence of adrenaline. At this concentration, U46619 alone is known to induce a rapid shape change through G12/G13 activation but no aggregation due to insufficient Gq signaling (3Klages B. Brandt U. Simon M.I. Schultz G.

However, the concomitant stimulation of Gi by the addition of adrenaline (10 μm) induced irreversible integrin αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation (Fig. 5 D). These results demonstrate that the contribution of G12/G13 signaling to platelet activation also plays a significant role in wild-type platelets, at least at low agonist concentrations. This may reflect the in vivosituation where a variety of stimuli, which are present at submaximally active concentration, synergistically induce platelet activation during thrombus formation. Taken together, our data show that the activation of G12/G13- and Gi-mediated signaling pathways is sufficient to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Although, Gq-mediated signaling processes are essential for calcium mobilization and thus play an important role in platelet activation, they are not absolutely required for the activation of integrin αIIbβ3. These data indicate that the activation of platelets through G-protein-coupled receptors is a highly integrated process, which in order to occur with high efficiency requires the activation of at least three G-protein-mediated pathways involving Gq, Gi, and G12/13.

https://openalex.org/W2062438193,"Alkyl nitrates are a significant component of the ""odd nitrogen"" reservoir and play an important role in regulating tropospheric ozone levels in remote marine regions. Measurements of methyl and ethyl nitrate in seawater and air samples along two Atlantic Ocean transects provide the first direct evidence for an oceanic source of these compounds. Equatorial surface waters were highly supersaturated (up to 800%) in both species, with the waters in the temperate regions generally being closer to equilibrium. A simple box model calculation suggests that the equatorial source could be a major component of the local atmospheric alkyl nitrate budget."

https://openalex.org/W2001519383,"Methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins (MBD) mediate functional responses of methylated DNA. MBD2 and MBD3 are components of the MeCP1 protein complex, which contains the Mi-2/NuRD complex and includes 66- and 68-kDa polypeptides. Here we identified two highly related 66-kDa proteins in a yeast two-hybrid screen with MBD2b. Based on the high degree of sequence conservation to the previously identified <i>Xenopus</i> p66 subunit of the Mi-2/NuRD complex, we termed these proteins hp66α and hp66β. hp66α is the human orthologue of <i>Xenopus</i> p66, whereas hp66β, previously identified as a component of the human MeCP1 complex, is a second member of a p66 gene family. Coprecipitation of hp66α and MBD2 demonstrates their <i>in vivo</i> association. Furthermore, confocal microscopy shows a nuclear colocalization of hp66α with hp66β and MBD2 in a speckled pattern. hp66α is a potent transcriptional repressor reducing gene activity about 100-fold and is ubiquitously coexpressed with hp66β in cell lines and in fetal and adult tissues. We demonstrate direct binding of both p66 family members to MBD2 as well as MBD3. Interestingly, hp66α, which binds with a higher affinity than hp66β, interacts via two interaction domains in contrast to a single interaction domain present in hp66β. These results demonstrate that two highly related mammalian p66 proteins display overlapping functions and are involved in methylation dependent transcriptional repression."

Using a deletion mutant of calmodulin, we demonstrate that amino acids 2–8 are required for high affinity binding of calmodulin to RYR1 at both nmand μm Ca2+ concentrations and are required for maximum inhibition of the channel at μmCa2+ concentrations. In contrast, the addition of three amino acids to the N terminus of calmodulin increased the affinity for RYR1 at both nm and μm Ca2+concentrations, but destroyed its functional effects on RYR1 at nm Ca2+. Using both full-length RYR1 and synthetic peptides, we demonstrate that the calmodulin-binding site on RYR1 is likely to be noncontiguous, with the C-terminal lobe of both apocalmodulin and Ca2+-calmodulin binding to amino acids between positions 3614 and 3643 and the N-terminal lobe binding at sites that are not proximal in the primary sequence. Ca2+binding to the C-terminal lobe of calmodulin converted it from an activator to an inhibitor, but an interaction with the N-terminal lobe was required for a maximum effect on RYR1. This interaction apparently depends on the native sequence or structure of the first few amino acids at the N terminus of calmodulin. Calmodulin activates the skeletal muscle Ca2+ release channel RYR1 at nmCa2+ concentrations and inhibits the channel at μm Ca2+ concentrations. Using a deletion mutant of calmodulin, we demonstrate that amino acids 2–8 are required for high affinity binding of calmodulin to RYR1 at both nmand μm Ca2+ concentrations and are required for maximum inhibition of the channel at μmCa2+ concentrations.

This interaction apparently depends on the native sequence or structure of the first few amino acids at the N terminus of calmodulin. The skeletal muscle calcium release channel RYR1 is regulated by calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; mCaM, mammalian calmodulin; dCaM, Drosophila calmodulin; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. in both its Ca2+-free (apoCaM) and Ca2+-bound (Ca2+-CaM) states. ApoCaM is a partial agonist, whereas Ca2+-CaM is an inhibitor of the channel (1Tripathy A., Xu, L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar). Both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM bind with nanomolar affinity to RYR1 (2Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar, 3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z.

The ability of bound calmodulin to protect sites on RYR1 from tryptic cleavage was used to identify a site between amino acids 3614 and 3643 as a binding site for both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM (5Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar). This site was predicted to be a CaM-binding site by Takeshima et al. (6Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanoaka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM can bind to a synthetic peptide (R3614–43) representing amino acids 3614–3643 of RYR1. ApoCaM requires amino acids at the C-terminal part of this peptide, but Ca2+-CaM does not, leading to the suggestion that CaM undergoes an N-terminal shift within the binding site upon binding Ca2+ (3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z. Krol J. Pedersen S. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar). In the course of analyzing the interaction of CaM with RYR1, we found that the addition of three amino acids (Gly-Ser-His) to the N terminus of Drosophila CaM (designated (N+3)dCaM) increases its affinity for RYR1 compared with wild-type CaM. The additional amino acids do not significantly change the maximum binding at either nm or μm calcium concentrations (3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z. Krol J. Pedersen S. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar). The ability of three amino acids to produce a large increase in affinity led us to investigate this phenomenon in greater detail. There are at least two possible explanations for the affinity increase: 1) the extension alters the conformation of the molecule; and/or 2) the N-terminal amino acids of CaM make specific and essential contacts with RYR1, and these residues are more accessible in the mutant. Another type of mutant CaM involving the N terminus has also been studied. The deletion of seven amino acids (DQLTEEQ, residues 2–8) from the N terminus of mammalian CaM ((N2–8)mCaM) abolishes CaM-dependent activation of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. This mutant CaM still binds the kinase with high affinity (7Persechini A. Gansz K.J. Paresi R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19279-19282Google Scholar). Small-angle x-ray scattering structural analysis indicates that this mutant CaM has a different location in the complex with the kinase than native CaM (8Krueger J.K. Gallagher S.C. Zhi G. Geguchadze R. Persechini A. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4535-4538Google Scholar). These findings with the N-terminally altered CaMs suggest that the addition or deletion of a few amino acids at the N terminus can greatly change CaM interaction with a subset of targets. To determine the role for the N terminus of CaM in regulating RYR1, we analyzed the effects of addition and deletion of N-terminal amino acids of CaM on its interaction with RYR1 and the known CaM-binding peptide R3614–43, which represents the CaM-binding site on RYR1. Our findings suggest a complex role of both lobes of CaM in regulating the activity of RYR1. Tran35S-labelTM (1175 Ci/mmol) was obtained from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Irvine, CA).

Fluorescent derivatives of CaM (F19W-CaM and F92W-CaM) were graciously provided by Dr. D. J. Black (Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH). Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The peptide was synthesized in the core facility at Baylor College of Medicine under the direction of Dr. Richard Cook. SR membranes were prepared from rabbit hind leg and backstrap skeletal muscle and purified using a previous method (9Hawkes M.J. Diaz-Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Membr. Biochem. 1989; 8: 133-145Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al.(10Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The mCaM cDNA was graciously provided by Dr. Ruth Altschuld (Ohio State University). The mCaM and dCaM cDNAs were subcloned into pET3 vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI) for expression. The (N2–8)mCaM DNA was subcloned into the pMCMI-26 vector for expression. The subcloning of the wild-type dCaM cDNA into the pET28a expression vector was used to produce (N+3)dCaM. Expression and purification of wild-type CaM and (N2–8)mCaM were carried out as described previously (11Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar, 12Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 830-836Google Scholar). (N+3)dCaM was expressed and purified as described previously (5Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L.

Expressed mCaM was metabolically labeled as described in the literature (14Lydan M.A. O'Day B.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 31: 389-396Google Scholar) and purified following the same method used for purification of wild-type CaM and (N2–8)mCaM. Expression and purification of mCaM amino acids 1–75 (CaM-(1–75)), 1–80 (CaM-(1–80)), and 76–148 (CaM-(76–148)) were performed as previously described (15Pedigo S. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1179-1196Google Scholar, 16Sorensen B.R. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4244-4253Google Scholar, 17Sorensen B.R. Faga L, A. Hultman R. Shea M.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15-20Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using purchased bovine brain CaM as the standard. To express and purify N-CaM and C-CaM, the cDNA fragments corresponding to amino acid residues 1–79 and 78–148, respectively, were individually PCR-amplified from the pAED4 vector containing the human liver CaM cDNA. Each amplified cDNA fragment was digested with NdeI andHindIII, gel-purified, and then ligated into the pET3 expression vector. N-CaM and C-CaM were expressed and purified following the same procedure used for wild-type CaM and (N2–8)mCaM. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine brain CaM as the standard for the C-CaM construct and aprotinin as the standard for the N-CaM protein. SR membranes (10 μg/100 μl in each assay) were incubated with 5 nm35S-labeled CaM and increasing concentrations of unlabeled mCaM, dCaM, (N+3)dCaM, (N2–8)mCaM, N-CaM, and C-CaM for 2 h at room temperature in binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mm EGTA) in the absence (low Ca2+ buffer) or presence (high Ca2+ buffer) of 1.2 mmCaCl2 for binding at low or high Ca2+, respectively. Nonspecific binding is defined as binding in the presence of 5 μm unlabeled mCaM. Bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand by filtration through Whatman GF/F filters presoaked in binding buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the filters were washed with 5 × 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. The equilibrium inhibition constant (K i) was calculated with the equation described previously (11Rodney G.G. Williams B.Y. Strasburg G.M. Beckingham K. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7807-7812Google Scholar). SR membranes (10 μg/200 μl in each assay) were incubated with 5 nm [3H]ryanodine and 5 μm CaMs under CaM-saturated assay conditions or with 1 nm [3H]ryanodine and increasing CaM concentrations under CaM titration assay conditions at room temperature for 16 h in binding buffer. Nonspecific binding is defined as binding in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled ryanodine. Bound [3H]ryanodine was separated from free ligand by the same methods used for 35S-labeled CaM binding. To determine the interaction of CaM with the CaM-binding peptide R3614–43 on RYR1, 15 μl of 10 μm CaM was incubated with increasing concentrations of R3614–43 (0–100 μm) for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (low Ca2+) or 0.2 mm CaCl2 (high Ca2+). 15 μl of 2× nondenaturing sample buffer was added to the samples before loading onto a nondenaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel. To determine the interaction of CaM fragments (N-CaM, amino acids 1–79; and C-CaM, amino acids 78–148) representing the N- and C-terminal lobes of CaM with R3614–43, 4 μm CaM was incubated in 30 μl of 1× nondenaturing sample buffer with increasing concentrations of R3614–43 (0–40 μm) for 0.5–2 h at room temperature in the presence of 1 mm EGTA (low Ca2+) or 0.2 mm CaCl2 (high Ca2+). The gels were run at 30 mA and at 4 °C in the appropriate running buffer based on the Ca2+ concentration (18Pate P. Mochca-Morales J., Wu, Y. Zhang J.-Z. Rodney G.G. Serysheva I.I. Williams B.Y. Anderson M.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39786-39792Google Scholar). To determine the effect of N-terminal mutation on the affinity of CaM for Ca2+, the Ca2+-dependent tryptophan fluorescence enhancement of R3614–43 bound to CaM was assayed. 3 μmCaM and 3 μm R3614–43 were incubated for 2 h with increasing calcium concentrations (0–39 μm free Ca2+) in standardized Ca2+ buffers containing 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm KCl, and 30 mm MOPS (pH 7.2) (Molecular Probes, Inc.). To monitor the effect of R3614–43 on the affinity of the CaM lobes for Ca2+, fluorescence changes in fluorescent derivatives of CaM substituted with tryptophan at either position 19 or 92 (F19W-CaM and F92W-CaM, respectively) were analyzed. 2.5 μm CaM fluorescent derivative and 10 μmR3614–43 were incubated as described above. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 280 and 328 nm, respectively. Spectra were collected on a SPECTRAmax GEMINI dual-scanning microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices) as described previously (3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z. Krol J. Pedersen S. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar, 19Sencer S. Papineni R.V.L. Halling D.B. Pate P. Krol J. Zhang J.-Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38237-38241Google Scholar), and data were fit to a Hill equation as described by Murase and Iio (20Murase T. Iio T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1618-1629Google Scholar). To determine the interaction of the N- and C-terminal constructs of CaM (amino acids 1–75, 1–80, and 76–148) with R3614–43, the fluorescence emission spectra of tryptophan 3620 in R3614–43 were monitored in the presence of these constructs at low and high calcium concentrations. 6 μm R3614–43 and variable concentrations of CaMs (mCaM, CaM-(1–75), CaM-(1–80), and CaM-(76–148)) were incubated at 22 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 50 μm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, and 1 mm MgCl2 (low Ca2+) plus 10 mm CaCl2 (high Ca2+). Multiple CaM/peptide ratios were used to determine the saturating effect of CaMs on R3614–43 fluorescence. Spectra were collected using an SLM-AMINCO Model 4800CTM, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, a step size of 0.5 nm, and a band pass of 4 nm. Each spectrum shown was obtained by averaging three buffer corrected spectra and normalizing the average to the intensity at the maximum fluorescence emission wavelength of R3614–43 alone. To elucidate the effect of N-terminal mutation on the secondary structures of CaM, CaM was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. Considering the far-UV transparency of buffers, the buffer conditions used for CD measurement were different from those used in other experiments in this study. 50 μg/ml CaM in 5 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9) and 0.1 mm EGTA (low Ca2+) or 0.1 mm CaCl2 (high Ca2+) was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. CD spectra were recorded with an Olis 1000 RSM spectropolarimeter (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA) using a 1-mm cylindrical quartz cell as described previously (21Xiong L.-W. Raymond L.D. Hayes S.F. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 669-678Google Scholar). For each spectrum, a minimum of five scans was collected from 250 to 188 nm with a step resolution of 1 nm under constant nitrogen gas purge. All spectra were verified in three separately prepared samples. Base-line spectra of buffer and buffer + EGTA or CaCl2 were collected and subtracted from the experimental spectra where appropriate. We have previously shown that 35S-labeled (N+3)dCaM, derived from cleavage of the His tag when expressed in the pET28a vector, has an ∼6-fold higher affinity for RYR1 than the non-extended CaM at both nm and μm Ca2+concentrations (3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z. Krol J. Pedersen S. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar). This finding led us to systematically analyze the interactions of N-terminal mutant CaMs with RYR1. We expressed and purified mCaM, (N2–8)mCaM, dCaM, and (N+3)dCaM and compared the interactions of these CaMs with RYR1 and the calmodulin-binding peptide from RYR1 (R3614–43). Although there are three amino acid differences in sequence between mCaM and dCaM, they are all in the C-terminal lobe (positions 99, 143, and 147) and do not significantly alter the interactions with either RYR1 or the synthetic peptide R3614–43 (data not shown). For brevity, we will show mCaM rather than both mCaM and dCaM as a wild-type CaM control in all figures and tables. To evaluate the effects of the mutations on their affinity for RYR1, we compared the ability of these CaMs to inhibit the binding of 35S-labeled mCaM to SR membranes. Significant differences in affinity were detected between wild-type and mutant CaMs at both low (Fig.1 A) and high (Fig.1 B) Ca2+ concentrations. TheK i values are summarized in TableI. (N+3)dCaM had a 5-fold higher affinity at low Ca2+ concentrations and a 4-fold higher affinity at high Ca2+ concentrations than mCaM, whereas (N2–8)mCaM had 8- and 3-fold lower affinities than mCaM at low and high calcium concentrations, respectively (Table I). These effects of the N-terminal alterations on the overall affinity of CaM suggest that the N-terminal lobe of CaM is important in the interaction with RYR1.Table IEquilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) for different CaMs from competition with 35S-labeled mCaM bindingmCaM(N + 3)dCaM(N2–8)mCaMN-CaMC-CaMK i(low Ca2+)54 ± 4 nm11 ± 1 nm446 ± 25 nm≥120 μm≥7 μmK i(high Ca2+)41 ± 2 nm10 ± 1 nm106 ± 5 nm≥60 μm≥3 μm Open table in a new tab The requirement of both lobes for binding is further supported by the findings that CaM fragments representing only the N- or C-terminal lobe have dramatically reduced affinities for RYR1. The inhibition of 35S-labeled CaM by N-CaM (amino acids 1–78) and C-CaM (amino acids 79–148) at <10 nm and 200 μm Ca2+ is also shown in Fig. 1 (Aand B), respectively. At <10 nmCa2+, the apparent K i for C-CaM is >7 μm, whereas the K i for N-CaM is >120 μm. At 200 μm Ca2+, the apparent K i for C-CaM is >3 μm, whereas the K i for N-CaM is >60 μm(Table I). The finding that the addition of three amino acids to the N terminus increased the affinity of CaM for RYR1, whereas the deletion of seven amino acids decreased its affinity, led us to examine the effects of these CaMs on [3H]ryanodine binding. [3H]Ryanodine binding is frequently used to screen for functional effects of agents on RYR1 (22Chu A. Diaz-Munoz M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Hamilton S.L. Mol.

This is based on the finding that ryanodine binds preferentially to the open state of the channel; and agents that enhance [3H]ryanodine binding are generally channel activators, and agents that inhibit [3H]ryanodine binding are generally channel inhibitors (22Chu A. Diaz-Munoz M. Hawkes M.J. Brush K. Hamilton S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 735-741Google Scholar, 26Lu X., Xu, L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Google Scholar, 27Valdivia H.H.

[3H]Ryanodine binds with high affinity to one site per RYR1 tetramer. To determine the effect of N-terminal mutations on the functional interaction of CaM with RYR1, we analyzed [3H]ryanodine binding to SR membranes in the presence of the different CaMs at low and high Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 2). Although (N+3)dCaM had the highest affinity for RYR1 at low Ca2+, it had a very poor ability to enhance [3H]ryanodine binding at low Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, it was as effective as mCaM in inhibiting [3H]ryanodine binding at high Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, higher affinity does not correlate with increased efficacy. The situation with (N2–8)mCaM was somewhat different. This mutant CaM had a lower affinity for RYR1 at both low and high Ca2+concentrations and, at 5 μm, also showed decreased enhancement of [3H]ryanodine binding at low Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A) and decreased inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding at high Ca2+ compared with mCaM (Fig. 2 B). The decreased activation by (N2–8)mCaM compared with mCaM at low Ca2+ is consistent with its lower affinity. However, the 5 μm(N2–8)mCaM used in the experiments at high Ca2+ should have been close to saturation (Table I). To determine whether this is really an issue with saturation, we examined [3H]ryanodine binding at low and high Ca2+with increasing concentrations of (N2–8)mCaM (Fig. 2, C andD). At low Ca2+, (N2–8)mCaM enhanced [3H]ryanodine binding to the same extent as wild-type CaM, but the maximum enhancement required a much higher concentration (Fig. 2 C). At high Ca2+, the inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding by (N2–8)mCaM was biphasic (Fig.2 D), suggesting that 1) some of the (N2–8)mCaM is misfolded; 2) (N2–8)mCaM has reduced efficacy, but high concentrations have a nonspecific effect on the channel; or 3) a second molecule of CaM binds at the higher concentrations of CaM. Misfolding of a large fraction of (N2–8)mCaM at high Ca2+ seems unlikely based on the CD data described below. This type of biphasic inhibition curve was not seen with any of the other mutant CaMs. The CaM fragments had a greatly reduced affinity for RYR1 at both high and low Ca2+ concentrations. The low affinity of N-CaM (representing amino acids 1–78) precludes its use in [3H]ryanodine binding assays. However, C-CaM (representing amino acids 79–148) at 10 μm did produce some enhancement of [3H]ryanodine binding at low Ca2+ and some inhibition of binding at high Ca2+, but the effect was much less than that seen with mCaM and mutant CaMs (data not shown). These findings again argue that both lobes of CaM are required for high affinity binding at both nm and μm Ca2+concentrations. Our data with35S-labeled CaM and [3H]ryanodine binding indicate that the addition or deletion of amino acids at the N terminus of CaM can alter affinity, efficacy, or both for interaction with RYR1. We have previously identified a CaM-binding site on native RYR1 (5Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.-Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar) and have shown that a synthetic peptide matching the sequence of this site can bind both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM (3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z. Krol J. Pedersen S. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar). We examined the effects of the N-terminal alterations in CaM on its interactions with this synthetic peptide. The interaction of the mutant CaMs with the synthetic peptide matching amino acids 3614–3643 on RYR1 was assessed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We found that addition or deletion of amino acids at the N terminus of CaM did not significantly alter the binding to R3614–43. The data obtained at high and low Ca2+ concentrations are shown in Fig.3. In this gel system, the peptide alone did not enter the gel due to its positive charge. On the high Ca2+ gels, the complex of the peptide and CaM can be seen above the free CaM band. However, on the low Ca2+ gels, the CaM·peptide complex did not migrate as a discrete band; and therefore, the extent of interaction was assessed by the disappearance of the free CaM band. Representative gels using low and high Ca2+ concentrations are shown in the insets in Fig. 3 (A and B, respectively). The summarized data (I/I 0, the ratio of the intensity of the CaM band in the presence of the peptide to that of CaM alone) from the densitometric analysis of the CaM band at low and high Ca2+ with increasing peptide/CaM ratios are shown in Fig. 3(A and B). The intensity of the CaM band decreased to a constant level that was independent of the concentration of R3614–43. This residual CaM may arise from dissociation of the complex on the gel during electrophoresis or from limited solubility of the peptide. All of the CaMs behaved the same as mCaM at both high and low Ca2+. The lack of an effect of the mutations on the interactions of CaMs with the peptide suggested that the N-terminal lobe of CaM was not interacting with this sequence. To test this, we expressed two constructs representing amino acids 1–79 and 78–148 and tested the ability of these half-CaMs to interact with peptide R3614–43 at high and low Ca2+ concentrations (Fig.4). N-CaM (amino acids 1–79) had a very low affinity for R3614–43 under low Ca2+ conditions, but some binding could be detected at high peptide/CaM ratios under high Ca2+ conditions. In contrast, C-CaM bound well to R3614–43 under both Ca2+ conditions, and the affinity of C-CaM for the peptide was even higher than that of mCaM. If both the N- and the C-terminal lobes of CaM were interacting with the peptide, then one would expect the affinity of full-length CaM to be considerably greater than that of the C-terminal lobe. However, the relative affinities suggest an interaction of only the C-terminal lobe in the intact molecule. The finding that C-CaM bound with higher affinity than wild-type CaM to the peptide but had greatly reduced affinity for binding to full-length RYR1 (Fig. 1) suggests that the binding site on RYR1 involves determinants other than those found within sequence 3614–3643 or that all or part of it is occluded in full-length RYR1. Fluorescence studies with other N- and C-terminal constructs of CaM support the above findings (Fig. 5). A fragment representing amino acids 76–148 of CaM (C-CaM) produced a fluorescence enhancement and blue shift in the tryptophan fluorescence of the R3614–43 peptide (Fig. 5 A, – – –), whereas fragments representing amino acids 1–75 and 1–80 of CaM did not change the tryptophan fluorescence of this peptide at low Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 5 A, —— and ▴). In contrast, both the N- and C-terminal constructs produced a fluorescence enhancement and blue shift in the tryptophan fluorescence of R3614–43 at high Ca2+, but with less enhancement with N-CaM compared with C-CaM (Fig. 5 B). The affinity of N-CaM for R3614–43 at high Ca2+ was lower than that of C-CaM, but nonetheless, binding was definitely detected (Fig. 5 B,inset). Combining the results of Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, we conclude that the C-terminal lobe of CaM binds constitutively to the R3614–43 peptide, but the N-terminal lobe requires Ca2+binding for peptide association. The interaction of the Ca2+-bound N-terminal lobe with R3614–43 appears to be a low affinity interaction. The affinity of CaM for Ca2+ often increases when it is complexed with its target site (30Olwin B.B. Storm D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8081-8086Google Scholar). Because the R3614–43 peptide contains a tryptophan at residue 3620, we were able to examine the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of R3614–43 complexed with CaM as a function of Ca2+ concentration (3Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B. Zhang J.-Z. Krol J. Pedersen S. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar). To determine whether N-terminal mutations alter the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction of CaM with the peptide, we measured the tryptophan fluorescence of a mixture of CaM and R3614–43 at different Ca2+ concentrations. These data are shown in Fig.6 A. R3614–43 showed a Ca2+-dependent fluorescence (relative fluorescence units) enhancement in the presence of all three CaMs. No significant differences in fluorescence properties and calcium binding parameters were observed between the mutant CaMs and mCaM (TableII). These results further confirm that alteration of the N-terminal amino acids of CaM does not significantly alter its binding to R3614–43 and its affinity for calcium.Table IICa2+ dependence of the interaction of the different CaMs with R3614–43ComplexRFUminRFUmax − RFUminK d(Ca2+)nmmCaM·R3614–43560 ± 30599 ± 3458 ± 9(N + 3)dCaM·R3614–43543 ± 34631 ± 4991 ± 20(N2–8)mCaM·R3614–43630 ± 20521 ± 3174 ± 10Data were fit as described in the literature (20Murase T.

https://openalex.org/W2126785923,"Transcription by RNA polymerase-II (RNAPII) is controlled by multisite phosphorylation of the heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit. Phosphorylation of CTD is mediated by the cyclin-dependent protein kinases Cdk7 and Cdk9, whereas protein serine/threonine phosphatase FCP1 dephosphorylates CTD. We have recently reported that human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transcription is positively regulated by protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and that PP1 dephosphorylates recombinant CTD. Here, we provide further evidence that PP1 can dephosphorylate RNAPII CTD. In vitro, PP1 dephosphorylated recombinant CTD as well as purified RNAPII CTD. HeLa nuclear extracts were found to contain a species of PP1 that dephosphorylates both serine 2 and serine 5 of the heptapeptide repeats. In nuclear extracts, PP1 and FCP1 contributed roughly equally to the dephosphorylation of serine 2. PP1 co-purified with RNAPII by gel filtration and associated with RNAPII on immunoaffinity columns prepared with anti-CTD antibodies. In cultured cells treated with CTD kinase inhibitors, the dephosphorylation of RNAPII on serine 2 was inhibited by 45% by preincubation with okadaic acid, which inhibits phosphatases of PPP family, including PP1 but not FCP1. Our data demonstrate that RNAPII CTD is dephosphorylated by PP1 in vitro and by PPP-type phosphatase, distinct from FCP1,in vivo. Transcription by RNA polymerase-II (RNAPII) is controlled by multisite phosphorylation of the heptapeptide repeats in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit.

During a single cycle of transcription, the largest subunit of RNAPII is extensively phosphorylated and then dephosphorylated on its C-terminal domain (CTD) containing a tandem array of 26–52 heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence Tyr 1The abbreviations used are: RNAPII, RNA polymerase-II; RNAPIIa, hypophosphorylated RNAPII; RNAPIIo, hyperphosphorylated RNAPII; CTD, C-terminal domain; CTDa, hypophosphorylated CTD; CTDo, hyperphosphorylated CTD; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; PPP, protein phosphatase family; PP1, protein phosphatase-1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; Cdk, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase.-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7(1Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Google Scholar). The hypophosphorylated RNAPII (RNAPIIa) is recruited to the preinitiation complex, in which RNAPII is hyperphosphorylated (RNAPIIo) by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk7, a subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar). During elongation of transcription, the CTD is additionally phosphorylated by Cdk9 (3Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenbaltt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the CTD is required for promoter clearance, efficient transcription elongation, and recruitment of mRNA processing factors, including capping enzyme and splicing factors (4Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Google Scholar). At the end of the transcription cycle, RNAPII is dephosphorylated by a phosphatase, FCP1, which is the only known member of a novel family of protein phosphatases (5Bensaude O. Bonnet F. Casse C. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Palancade B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 249-255Google Scholar). FCP1 is required for the regeneration of initiation-competent RNAPII and may also antagonize the action of Cdk8, which inhibits transcription by phosphorylation of RNAPII prior to its recruitment to the preinitiation complex (6Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Google Scholar). FCP1 dephosphorylates Ser-2 during elongation of transcription but not Ser-5 during initiation of transcription (3Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenbaltt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that another, yet unidentified protein phosphatase is involved in regulation of CTD phosphorylation during transcription. In accordance with this view, okadaic acid, which inhibits phosphatases of the PPP family, including PP1, but not FCP1 (7Fernandez J.J. Candenas M.L. Souto M.L. Trujillo M.M. Norte M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 229-262Google Scholar), has been reported to induce RNAPII phosphorylation in growing HeLa cells (8Dubois M.F. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 417-426Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that a PPP-type protein phosphatase may dephosphorylate RNAPII CTD. Our previous studies have demonstrated that protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1) is involved in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar, 10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar). We have shown that HIV-1 Tat associates with PP1 (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar) and that a Tat-associated CTD kinase protein complex contains a nuclear regulator of PP1, known as NIPP1 (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar). In our experiments, addition of purified PP1 induced the elongation of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter in vitro (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar, 10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar). We have also reported that PP1 dephosphorylates recombinant CTD phosphorylated by CDK9/cyclin T1 (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggested that PP1 might be implicated in the regulation of HIV-1 transcription by controlling the level of RNAPII phosphorylation. PP1 belongs to the PPP family of serine-threonine protein phosphatases, which also includes PP2A, PP2B, and PP4-6 (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). With the exception of PP2B, the concentration of protein phosphatases of the PPP family is 2–10-fold higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). The nucleus of mammalian cells contains multiple species of PP1. They consist of a constant catalytic subunit and a variable regulatory (R−) subunit that determines the localization, activity, and substrate specificity of the phosphatase (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). One of the major nuclear subunits of PP1 is NIPP1 (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). NIPP1 targets PP1 to nuclear speckles that also contain RNAPII (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of particular interest to analyze whether PP1 associates with RNAPII and/or mediates RNAPII dephosphorylation. In the present study, recombinant CTD was hyperphosphorylated with purified Cdk7 (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar) and used as a substrate for purified catalytic subunit of PP1 (PP1c). In addition, we also used as a substrate the entire RNAPII CTD, which was phosphorylated during transcriptionin vitro. Furthermore, a species of PP1 present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts was utilized to dephosphorylate the RNAPII CTD. We evaluated the relative contribution of PP1 and FCP1 to the dephosphorylation of Ser-2 in HeLa nuclear extracts using reported PP1 and FCP1 inhibitors. Next, we analyzed whether PP1 was present in the same macromolecular complex with RNAPII and whether there was a direct association between PP1 and RNAPII. Finally, we used the phenomena of rapid RNAPII dephosphorylation in the cells treated with Cdk7 and Cdk9 inhibitors (13Lovoie S.B. Albert A.L. Handa H. Vincent M. Bensaude O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 675-685Google Scholar) to analyze whether it was PP1 that mediated the RNAPII dephosphorylation. We used okadaic acid, a well established cell-permeable inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A (7Fernandez J.J. Candenas M.L. Souto M.L. Trujillo M.M. Norte M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 229-262Google Scholar), to test whether inhibition of protein phosphatases of the PPP family would prevent RNAPII dephosphorylation. Our results indicate that RNAPII dephosphorylation is mediated by PP1 in vitro and by PPP-like protein phosphatase in vivo. COS-7 cells and HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). SuperoseTM 6 HR 10/30 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The GST-fused CTD of RNAPII was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (14Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S.

Flavopiridol ((−)cis-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-8-[4-(3-hydroxy-1-methyl)piperidinyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride) was a gift from Dr. Brady (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Polyhistidine-tagged NIPP1 fragments and NIPP1 mutants were prepared as described previously (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R.

HIV-1 Tat was expressed in E. coli and purified on Aquapore RP-300 column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by reverse-phase chromatography as described (19Allet B. Payton M. Mattaliano R.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Wingfield P.T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 259-268Google Scholar). 10 mg of phosphorylase-b was dissolved in 300 μl of buffer A (10 mm glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and dialyzed against the same buffer for 2–3 h. Then 7.5 μl of 500 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 6 μl of phosphorylase kinase prepared according to Ref. 20Jagiello I. Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17257-17263Google Scholar were added and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C followed by addition of 45 μl of ATP-Mg mix (8.3 mm ATP, 83 mmMgCl2, 75 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) and incubation for 2 h at 30 °C. Phosphorylase-a was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, resuspended in buffer A, and dialyzed against buffer A for 1–2 days at 4 °C. AG 501x8 (mixed anion and cation exchange) resin was placed in a separate dialysis bag to improve removal of unincorporated ATP and inorganic phosphate. Dialyzed phosphorylase-a was kept at 4 °C. Approximately 0.2 nmol of phosphorylase-a was used as a substrate for PP1 or PP2A. The phosphorylase phosphatase assay was carried out for 10 min in a buffer containing 50 mm glycylglycine at pH 7.4, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol as described (21Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Google Scholar). Where indicated, prior to the phosphorylase phosphatase assay, the samples were trypsinized to generate free, active catalytic subunit of PP1 (21Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16538-16544Google Scholar). CDK7-containing kinase complex (TTKa) was purified as described elsewhere (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar, 22Nekhai S. Shukla R.R Fernandez A. Kumar A. Lamb N.J.C. Virology. 2000; 266: 246-256Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extract from Jurkat T-cells was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and by conventional chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose. Flow-through activity (TTKa) was further purified on heparin-agarose and hydroxyapatite. Recombinant CTD was phosphorylated as we described earlier (23Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfrey A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-CTD (100 ng) was phosphorylated in a 20-μl reaction with 50 μm ATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 6 mm EGTA, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 30 °C. To induce CTD hyperphosphorylation, 40 μmmC2p peptide (ARAFGVPVRTYAHEVVTLWYRA (24Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar)) was added to the kinase reaction. A randomized peptide rC2p (HARTVGVWYRAEYARFVTPAVV (24Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar)) was used as a control. The reaction was supplemented with 7 mmEDTA to inactivate the kinase followed by addition of PP1 and incubation for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (Packard Instrument Co.). The analysis was carried out on the Hunter thin-layer peptide mapping electrophoresis system (C.B.S. Scientific, Del Mar, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, hyperphosphorylated CTD, prepared as described above, was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The portion of the membrane containing CTDo was boiled in 5.7 m HCl at 110 °C to liberate 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids as described (25Cooper J.A. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Google Scholar). After the hydrolysis, the sample was lyophilized and resuspended in the buffer for pH 1.9 electrophoresis with the addition of 0.06 mg/ml phosphoamino acid standards. The sample was resolved by thin-layer electrophoresis on a cellulose plate (C.B.S. Scientific) at pH 1.9 in the first direction and at pH 3.5 in the second direction. Cold standards were visualized by staining the plate with 0.25% ninhydrine dissolved in acetone. Positions of labeled phosphoamino acids were analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (Packard Instrument Co.). RNAPII was phosphorylated in transcription reaction (20 μl) containing 50 μg of HeLa nuclear extract; 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP; and 0.2 μg of JK2 linearized template (22Nekhai S. Shukla R.R Fernandez A. Kumar A. Lamb N.J.C. Virology. 2000; 266: 246-256Google Scholar) in transcription buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Transcription was carried out for 1 h at 30 °C. Reaction was terminated by addition of 7 mm EDTA. RNAPII was immunoprecipitated with α-CTD (8WG16) antibodies coupled to protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C and then extensively washed with TBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl). Alternatively, transcription reaction was terminated by 7 mm EDTA or flavopiridol and further incubated for 30 min at 30° to allow dephosphorylation of RNAPII by CTD phosphatases present in the nuclear extracts. HeLa nuclear extract (500 μg) was fractionated on SuperoseTM 6 HR 10/30 (AmershamBiosciences) in Buffer B (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 100 KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, concentrated on Microcone YM-10 spin columns (Millipore, Tempe, AZ), and analyzed by immunoblotting. The monoclonal α-CTD (8WG16) antibodies (1.5 mg) were coupled to 0.5 ml ofN-hydroxy succinimideactivated Sepharose 4 Fast Blue (Amersham Biosciences). The coupled beads were washed and equilibrated with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl). HeLa nuclear extract (750 μg) was loaded on the column. After washing off non-bound proteins with TBS, RNAPII was eluted with 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.4). COS-7 cells, HEK 293 cells, and HeLa cells were cultured in 24-well plates until 75% of confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. DRB was dissolved in 50% ethanol. Flavopiridol was dissolved in water. DRB (100 μm) or flavopiridol (25 μm) was added to the cell cultures for 1 h. Okadaic acid (dissolved in ethanol) was added as indicated at either 10 nm or 1 μm concentration for 30 min prior to the addition of DRB or flavopiridol. After the treatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on the plates in SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 2% SDS (100 μl per well). To estimate protein concentration, a portion of each lysate was briefly run on a 15% SDS-PAGE, allowing the samples to migrate for about 5 mm into the resolving gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue , photographed with a digital camera (Invitrogen), and quantified with phosphorimaging software. Lysates were resolved on 4% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against non-phosphorylated, Ser-2, and Ser-5 phosphorylated RNAPII CTD. We have recently reported that HIV-1 Tat and peptides derived from HIV-1 Tat enhanced the phosphorylation of RNAPII CTD by Cdk7/Cylin H, Cdk2/Cyclin E, and Cdk9/Cyclin T1 (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar, 23Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfrey A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Google Scholar). In the absence of the peptide activators, recombinant GST-CTD was poorly phosphorylated by any of the kinases (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar, 23Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfrey A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Google Scholar). While analyzing the effect of Tat on CTD phosphorylation, we found that a peptide, a pseudosubstrate for Cdk7 (mC2p (24Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar)), also stimulated CTD phosphorylation by purified Cdk7/cyclin H (Fig.1), Cdk1/cyclin B, and Cdk2/Cyclin E (not shown). Addition of mC2p stimulated GST-CTD hyperphosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A,lanes 2–5). Addition of mC2p increased the amount of CTDo more than 10-fold (Fig. 1 B), which appears as an apparent higher molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE. On the other hand, CTDa, which appears as an apparent lower molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A), co-migrated with the non-phosphorylated CTD (Fig.1 E). A randomized peptide (rC2p) did not stimulate CTD phosphorylation by Cdk7/cyclin H (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). The mC2p peptide also stimulated phosphorylation of purified yeast RNAPII (not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis showed the presence of phosphoserines in CTDo (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, histone H1 phosphorylated by CDK7/cyclin H contained phosphorylated serines and threonines (data not shown). The phosphorylation level of RNAPII was visualized by Western blot analysis with phosphoepitope-specific monoclonal antibodies that recognized phospho Ser-2 (H5) or phospho Ser-5 (H14) in the heptapeptide repeats of the CTD. Immunoblotting analysis showed that CDK7/cyclin H phosphorylated CTD in the presence of mC2p on Ser-2 and Ser-5 (Fig.1 E). We utilized the effect of CTD hyperphosphorylation in the presence of mC2p to generate CTDo, which was used as a substrate for the catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A (Fig. 2). Although PP1 dephosphorylated CTDo in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A andB, lanes 2–4), no dephosphorylation was seen with the structurally related PP2A (Fig. 2, D andE, lanes 2–4). Yet based on their activities toward the reference substrate, glycogen phosphorylase-a, PP2A was added at a 2-fold higher activity than PP1, dephosphorylating twice as much substrate as PP1 (Fig. 2, C and F,lanes 2–4). Moreover, since the specific phosphorylase phosphatase activity of PP2A is about 10-fold lower than that of PP1 (26Beullens M. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 93: 145-155Google Scholar), these data indicated that PP1 is at least a 20-fold better CTD phosphatase than is PP2A. The dephosphorylation of the CTD domain by 160 nm PP1 was completely blocked by the addition of 1 μm NIPP1 (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and3), a specific inhibitor of PP1 (27Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Google Scholar). This observation provides evidence that dephosphorylation of CTDo by PP1 was not mediated by a contaminating phosphatase and that the dephosphorylation was not an artifact resulting from proteolysis of the CTD. Because a high concentration of mC2p was present during the dephosphorylation reaction (typically between 20 and 30 μm), we have also asked whether the peptide affected the protein phosphatase activity of PP1 or PP2A. We found that the addition of 30 μm of either mC2p or the randomized rC2p peptide inhibited PP1 and PP2A by only 20% (data not shown), indicating that the data in Fig. 2 cannot be accounted for by the specific effects of mC2p on PP1 or PP2A.Figure 3NIPP1 inhibits CTDo dephosphorylation by PP1.

Subsequently, RNAPII was immunoprecipitated with the α-CTD (8WG16) monoclonal antibodies, and the immunoprecipitate was used as a substrate for purified PP1. The phosphorylation level of RNAPII was visualized by Western blot analysis with phosphoepitope-specific monoclonal antibodies that recognized phospho Ser-2 (H5) or phospho Ser-5 (H14) in the heptapeptide repeats of the CTD. In Fig. 4 A, it is shown that the purified catalytic subunit of PP1 dephosphorylated both Ser-2 and Ser-5 residues within CTD heptads. We subsequently examined whether the CTD domain of RNAPII could be dephosphorylated by the endogenous pool of PP1 present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Following phosphorylation of RNAPII during incubation of the extracts under conditions of transcription, the CTD kinases were blocked by 7 mm EDTA. We found that the addition of EDTA enabled the dephosphorylation of both Ser-2 and Ser-5 by an endogenous protein phosphatase (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). This endogenous protein phosphatase is not likely to be FCP1 because EDTA inhibits the Mg2+-dependent FCP1 and PPM families (28Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Google Scholar). We identified the endogenous phosphatase as PP1 because the dephosphorylation of Ser-2 and Ser-5 was blocked by the addition of NIPP1 (Fig. 4, lane 3). FCP1 is a well established CTD phosphatase that predominantly recognizes phosphorylated Ser-2 of CTD (3Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenbaltt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Google Scholar, 5Bensaude O. Bonnet F. Casse C. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Palancade B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 249-255Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to estimate the relative contribution of FCP1 and PP1 in the dephosphorylation of Ser-2. First, we analyzed the effect of inhibition of PP1 on the level of Ser-2 phosphorylation when FCP1 was not blocked by EDTA. Inhibition of PP1 with NIPP1 or okadaic acid in a transcription assay increased the level of Ser-2 phosphorylation by 30–45% (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–3). To estimate directly the contribution of FCP1 to the dephosphorylation of Ser-2, we made use of the reports that HIV-1 Tat inhibits FCP1 (29Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31726-31730Google Scholar) but does not affect CTD dephosphorylation by PP1 (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar). We also included a high concentration of flavopiridol to inhibit the CTD kinases (13Lovoie S.B. Albert A.L. Handa H. Vincent M. Bensaude O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 675-685Google Scholar) and to enable the dephosphorylation of RNAPII CTD by endogenous protein phosphatases (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). We arbitrarily set the difference in Ser-2 phosphorylation in the reaction before and after addition of flavopiridol as a 100% (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1 and 2). When PP1 was inhibited by NIPP1, and when FCP1 was active, ∼40% of Ser-2 was dephosphorylated (Fig.5 B, lane 3). When FCP1 was inhibited by Tat, and when PP1 was active, ∼30% of Ser-2 was dephosphorylated (Fig.5 B, lane 4). Therefore, PP1 dephosphorylates 30–45% of Ser-2 based on the observation in Fig. 5 A and ∼30% of Ser-2 based on the observations in Fig. 5 B. Combining these results together, PP1 may dephosphorylate ∼40% of Serine-2. Therefore, PP1 and FCP1 contributed roughly equally to dephosphorylation of Ser-2. PP1 is targeted to multiple organelles and macromolecular complexes by a host of regulatory subunits (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). We have examined whether PP1 is also associated with a nuclear macromolecular complex that contains RNAPII. Following gel filtration of HeLa cell nuclear extract on a Superose-6 column, the phosphorylase phosphatase activity was found in the fractions corresponding to the eluted complexes with masses of 67–2000 kDa (Fig.6 A, fractions 13–32). We identified the phosphatase activity belonging to PP1 because it was blocked by addition of NIPP1 (Fig. 6 A,fractions 15–32). PP1 activity therefore associated with complexes that eluted with masses ranging from the void volume of from 2000 to 200 kDa (Fig. 6 A), in accordance with the existence of multiple PP1 holoenzymes. RNAPII eluted in fractions 15–24 (Fig.6 A), which also contained PP1 activity. To assess whether PP1 and RNAPII were part of the same macromolecular complex, HeLa nuclear extracts were fractionated on an affinity column prepared with the α-CTD (8WG16) monoclonal antibodies. A HeLa cell nuclear extract was applied to this affinity column, and the retained proteins were eluted with a sodium acetate buffer at pH 3.4. Western blot analysis showed that both RNAPII and PP1 were partially retained by the column, whereas protein eIF2α, which served as a negative control, was not retained at all (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). These data suggested that RNAPII and a species of PP1 are the components of the same macromolecular complex and that PP1 could be involved in the regulation of RNAPII phosphorylation in the nucleus. In growing cells, RNAPII is rapidly dephosphorylated when the cells are treated with inhibitors of Cdk7 and Cdk9 (DRB and flavopiridol, (5Bensaude O. Bonnet F. Casse C. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Palancade B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 249-255Google Scholar, 13Lovoie S.B. Albert A.L. Handa H. Vincent M. Bensaude O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 675-685Google Scholar)). It has also been reported that treatment of growing cells with 1 μm okadaic acid increases RNAPII phosphorylation (8Dubois M.F. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 417-426Google Scholar). We utilized the effect of induced dephosphorylation of RNAPII and the effect of okadaic acid to analyze whether the dephosphorylation was in part mediated by a protein phosphatase of the PPP family. In growing COS-7 cells, RNAPII was phosphorylated on Ser-2 and Ser-5 (RNAPIIo, Fig.7, A and B,lane 3). Treatment with flavopiridol (Fig. 7, Aand B, lane 6) or DRB (not shown) resulted in a complete dephosphorylation of Ser-2 and Ser-5 residues. However, when the cells were pretreated with 1 μm okadaic acid prior to the treatment with flavopiridol, the dephosphorylation occurred only partially (Fig. 7 A, lane 8). The pretreatment with okadaic acid also increased the RNAPIIo level (Fig. 7 C,lane 8). Interestingly, the addition of 10 nmokadaic acid, which inhibits PP2A completely but has only a marginal effect on PP1 (7Fernandez J.J. Candenas M.L. Souto M.L. Trujillo M.M. Norte M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 229-262Google Scholar), had a much less pronounced effect on the recovery of Ser-2 and Ser-5 phosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B,lane 7) and did not increase RNAPIIo level (Fig.7 C, lane 7). Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells (not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that a protein phosphatase of the PPP family, most likely PP1, is involved in the dephosphorylation of RNAPIIo in growing cells. The present study describes a novel function of PP1, which is the dephosphorylation of RNAPII CTD. We provide evidence that PP1 dephosphorylates RNAPIIo in vitro and probably also in vivo. It is becoming clear that CTD phosphorylation is a dynamic process and is tightly regulated during transcription. Both protein kinases and protein phosphatases are of equal importance in the cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The role of protein kinases has been widely demonstrated and reviewed (2Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar), but only one RNAPII CTD phosphatase, FCP1, has been characterized (5Bensaude O. Bonnet F. Casse C. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Palancade B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 249-255Google Scholar). It has been shown that FCP1, which is part of RNAPII holoenzyme, dephosphorylates RNAPII CTD during elongation of transcription (3Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenbaltt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that FCP1 does not recognize recombinant CTD or purified RNAPII as a substrate and requires the RNAPII holoenzyme for its phosphatase activity (28Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Google Scholar). However, in a recent report, FCP1 dephosphorylated a CTD fragment containing four hepta repeats in vitro at acidic pH (30Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Google Scholar). The potential problem of the CTD dephosphorylation assay with full-length CTD is inefficient hyperphosphorylation of CTD by CTD kinases in vitro. Because some proteins such as HIV-1 Tat protein and its peptides could activate CTD kinases (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar, 23Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfrey A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Google Scholar), we hypothesized that kinase activation by peptides may be a useful approach for phosphatase studies. We generated CTDo substrate utilizing mC2p peptide. The mC2p peptide has been described by Cujec et al. (24Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar). It contains 20 amino acids from the Cdk2 sequence flanking a threonine mutated to alanine at position 160, which is normally phosphorylated by Cdk7/cyclin H. The mC2p blocks Tat transactivation in vitro and in vivo (24Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar, 31Okamoto H. Cujec T.P. Peterlin B.M. Okamoto T. Virology. 2000; 270: 337-344Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in our experimental conditions, mC2p increased the activities of Cdk7/cyclin H, Cdk2/cyclin E, and Cdk1/cyclin B when the recombinant CTD domain (23Deng L. Ammosova T. Pumfrey A. Kashanchi F. Nekhai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33922-33929Google Scholar) or purified yeast RNAPII (not shown) were used as substrates. Activation of Cdks is a two-step dynamic process; the first step is a rapid association of Cdk with a cyclin and involves the PSTAIRE motif, and the second step is an interaction between the T-loop of Cdk and the N-terminal helix of a cyclin (32Morris M.C. Gondeau C. Tainer J.A. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23847-23853Google Scholar). Recognition of T-loop by a cyclin is regulated by protein-protein interactions outside the T-loop and is not dependent on the primary sequence of the T-loop (33Garrett S. Barton W.A. Knights R. Jin P. Morgan D.O. Fisher R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 88-99Google Scholar). We speculate that the T-loop-derived peptide added at high concentration may interact with the cyclin and stimulate conformation changes needed for rearrangements of the ATP binding site (32Morris M.C. Gondeau C. Tainer J.A. Divita G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23847-23853Google Scholar). Based on our recent finding that PP1 positively regulates HIV-1 Tat activated transcription, we hypothesized that PP1 may function as a CTD phosphatase. This view is in accordance with an earlier report showing that a treatment of HeLa cells with okadaic acid results in a hyperphosphorylation of RNAPII (8Dubois M.F. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 417-426Google Scholar). Two protein phosphatases of the PPP family have been used in our study, PP1 and PP2A. The phosphatases have a high degree of homology, and both are present in the nucleus (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). Therefore, they may be potentially involved in regulation of transcription. We showed here that PP1 but not PP2A dephosphorylated recombinant CTDo. To rule out the possibility that the loss of the hyperphosphorylated form of CTD is the result of proteolysis rather than dephosphorylation, we have utilized a well known specific PP1 inhibitor NIPP1 (27Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Connor J. Shenolikar S. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14053-14061Google Scholar) and have shown that it blocks CTDo dephosphorylation. The function of PP1 as a CTD phosphatase was confirmed using immunopurified RNAPII. PP1 effectively dephosphorylated RNAPII. Recently it was shown that recombinant FCP1 preferentially dephosphorylates Ser-2 of RNAPII over Ser-5 in vitro (30Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Google Scholar). We show here that PP1 efficiently dephosphorylated both Ser-2 and Ser-5 of immunopurified RNAPII. Next, we analyzed whether HeLa nuclear extract contains a species of PP1, which may dephosphorylate RNAPII CTD. RNAPII was hyperphosphorylated during transcription assay, and then the kinases present in the nuclear extract were blocked by addition of 7 mm EDTA. Under these conditions, we observed spontaneous dephosphorylation of both Ser-2 and Ser-5 of CTD. Addition of EDTA blocks not only kinases but also the Mg2+-dependent FCP1 (28Chambers R.S. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24498-24504Google Scholar). Therefore, RNAPII dephosphorylation was mediated by a species of the PPP-type phosphatase. Because the RNAPII dephosphorylation was blocked by the addition of NIPP1, we conclude it was mediated by PP1 rather than by other phosphatases of the PPP subfamily. To investigate the relative contribution of PP1 and FCP1 to CTD dephosphorylation in HeLa nuclear extracts, we specifically inhibited FCP1 or PP1 by the addition of HIV-1 Tat or NIPP1, respectively. Our analysis indicates that PP1 and FCP1 roughly contribute equally to the dephosphorylation of Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. PP1 lacks a putative nuclear localization signal and is targeted to various subnuclear structures by specific targeting subunits (11Bollen M. Beullens M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 138-145Google Scholar). To assess the ability of PP1 to form a complex with RNAPII in the nucleus, we fractionated a HeLa nuclear extract by two different types of columns. We found that PP1 and RNAPII were co-migrated during gel filtration. Moreover, immunoaffinity chromatography, performed on a column prepared with immobilized anti-RNAPII antibodies, showed that a portion of RNAPII retained by the column also contained PP1. This provides direct evidence that PP1 and RNAPII are part of the same macromolecular complex and confirms our earlier observations that PP1c is part of the preinitiation complex formed on HIV-1 promoter (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar). PP1 remains associated with RNAPII during the initiation and early elongation step of HIV-1 transcription (9Bharucha D.C. Zhou M. Nekhai S. Brady J.N. Shukla R.R. Kumar A. Virology. 2002; 296: 6-16Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit that targets PP1 to the RNAPII complex has not yet been identified. NIPP1 is a possible candidate because it associates with PP1 with high affinity and is targeted to nuclear speckles that also contain RNAPII (12Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P. Van Eynde A. Vulsteke V. Jagiello I. Murray M. Krainer A.R. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol Chem. 2000; 275: 25411-25417Google Scholar). This view is also supported by our earlier observation that NIPP1 and PP1 were components of Tat-associated CTD kinase complex in T-lymphocytes (10Nekhai S. Zhou M. Fernandez A. Lane W.S. Lamb N.J.C. Brady J. Kumar A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 649-657Google Scholar). Taken together, our data imply that purified PP1 dephosphorylates both recombinant CTDo and immunoprecipitated RNAPII in vitro at physiological pH. HeLa nuclear extract contains PP1 species that form complexes with RNAPII and dephosphorylate it when kinases are blocked by EDTA or by flavopiridol. To analyze whether protein phosphatases of the PPP family contribute to the dephosphorylation of RNAPIIo in vivo, we used okadaic acid, a cell-permeable inhibitor of this family of protein phosphatases (5Bensaude O. Bonnet F. Casse C. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Palancade B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 249-255Google Scholar, 13Lovoie S.B. Albert A.L. Handa H. Vincent M. Bensaude O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 675-685Google Scholar). We found that a preincubation of the cells with 1 μm okadaic acid, but not 10 nm okadaic acid, partially prevented the dephosphorylation of RNAPII in intact cells. Since okadaic acid is a more potent inhibitor of PP2A than of PP1, these data are in agreement with a role for PP1 in the dephosphorylation of the CTD domain of RNAPII. Our report is the first demonstration that the dephosphorylation of RNAPII is mediated by PP1in vitro and probably also in vivo. We also have preliminary data indicating that the overexpression of NIPP1 blocks Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription in transient transfection assays and that overexpression of PP1 alleviates this inhibitory effect of NIPP1. However, it remains to be seen whether the stimulatory role of PP1 on HIV-1 transcription also involves the dephosphorylation of the CTD domain of RNAPII or is explained by the stimulation of a posttranscriptional process.

Brady (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) for the gift of flavopiridol."

The mechanism underlying the reversible modification of ALR2 was studied by mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular modeling approaches on the enzyme purified from bovine lens and on wild type and mutant recombinant forms of the human placental and rat lens ALR2. Two equivalents of copper ion were required to inactivate ALR2: one remained weakly bound to the oxidized protein whereas the other was strongly retained by the inactive enzyme. Cys303 appeared to be the essential residue for enzyme inactivation, because the human C303S mutant was the only enzyme form tested that was not inactivated by copper treatment. The final products of human and bovine ALR2 oxidation contained the intramolecular disulfide bond Cys298-Cys303. However, a Cys80-Cys303 disulfide could also be formed. Evidence for an intramolecular rearrangement of the Cys80-Cys303 disulfide to the more stable product Cys298-Cys303 is provided. Molecular modeling of the holoenzyme supports the observed copper sequestration as well as the generation of the Cys80-Cys303disulfide. However, no evidence of conditions favoring the formation of the Cys298-Cys303 disulfide was observed. Our proposal is that the generation of the Cys298-Cys303 disulfide, either directly or by rearrangement of the Cys80-Cys303 disulfide, may be induced by the release of the cofactor from ALR2 undergoing oxidation. The occurrence of a less interactive site for the cofactor would also provide the rationale for the lack of activity of the disulfide enzyme forms.

Our proposal is that the generation of the Cys298-Cys303 disulfide, either directly or by rearrangement of the Cys80-Cys303 disulfide, may be induced by the release of the cofactor from ALR2 undergoing oxidation. The occurrence of a less interactive site for the cofactor would also provide the rationale for the lack of activity of the disulfide enzyme forms. aldose reductase bovine lens ALR2 human placental recombinant ALR2 h-C80S, h-C303S, cysteine to serine mutated h-ALR2 rat lens recombinant ALR2 cysteine to serine mutated r-ALR2 carboxamidomethyl dithiothreitol glutathione-modified ALR2 liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry 2-mercaptoethanol molecular dynamics molecular mechanics Transition metals have a relevant role among systems that can induce or modulate oxidative stress. They are both able to promote the formation of reactive oxygen species (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4503) Google Scholar) and to act as cofactors in enzymatic systems devoted to counteract oxidative stress. The important role of the copper ion as an effective prosthetic group for special protein functions and its role as a potential toxic agent in cell function are handled by the cell through a fine control of the free copper level by highly efficient metal chelating proteins (2Stückel J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3Linder M.C. Hazegh-Azam M. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1996; 63: 797S-811SPubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, it is worth noting the extensive cell damage associated with pathologies resulting from both excess and a deficit of copper, such as Wilson's and Menkes's disease, respectively (4Yuan D.S.

When the concentration of free copper increases, either by environmental or pathological causes, cell damage likely occurs (6Ogihara H. Ogihara T. Miki M. Yasuda H. Mino M. Pediatr.

The effectiveness of copper ion in inducing protein as well as nucleic acid oxidation, by eliciting the generation of reactive oxygen species through a Fenton-type reaction, is well documented (11Ueda J.

Eye Res. 1990; 50: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, because of its ability to bind proteins and nucleic acids, copper has the potential to specifically promote in situoxidative modification reactions. Thus, it is important to define the mechanisms underlying processes induced by copper-protein interaction. The effect of the copper ion on aldose reductase (alditol:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.21) (ALR2),1 isolated from bovine lens was previously described (17Cecconi I. Moroni M. Vilardo P.G.

It appears that the enzyme, which was previously shown to be especially susceptible to thiol-mediated oxidation (18Giannessi M. Del Corso A. Cappiello M. Voltarelli M. Marini I. Barsacchi D.

The enzyme is readily inactivated by the metal ion through an oxygen independent modification process. The modified enzyme, fully reactivated in the presence of dithiothreitol, was postulated to contain an intramolecular disulfide bond and to carry two equivalents of bound copper ion. Based on the characterization of the inactivation process and on the measurement of the redox state of the bound copper on the enzyme, it was concluded that the metal ion responsible for ALR2 inactivation was directly involved in a site specific oxidation mechanism of the enzyme. In this paper, the rationale for the definition of the copper binding site(s) and the formation of the disulfide bond in ALR2 is put forward through mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, and molecular modeling approaches on the enzyme and its mutants from different species.

The purification of b-ALR2 was performed as previously described (24Del Corso A. Barsacchi D. Giannessi M. Tozzi M.G. Camici M. Houben J.L. Zandomeneghi M. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The pure native enzyme (specific activity 1.12 units/mg) was stored at 4 °C in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (S-buffer), supplemented with 2 mm DTT. Expression of h-ALR2 in Escherichia coli was done as previously described (25Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Bhatnagar A. Liu S. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant aldose reductase was extracted from host cells by osmotic shock and stored at −70 °C until used. Wild type and mutated forms of h-ALR2 were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by the same chromatographic steps used for the bovine lens enzyme (24Del Corso A. Barsacchi D. Giannessi M. Tozzi M.G. Camici M. Houben J.L. Zandomeneghi M. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); the pure enzymes were stored at 4 °C in S-buffer supplemented with 2 mm DTT. The specific activities of h-ALR2 and its C298S, C80S, and C303S mutants were 3.9, 9.8, 3.1, and 6.2 units/mg, respectively. E. coli expressing r-ALR2 and its mutants was grown as previously described (26Old S.E. Sato S. Kador P.F. Carper D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4942-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice in 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.2, and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of the same buffer, sonicated, and stored at −70 °C until used. r-ALR2 and its mutants were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by the same chromatographic steps used for the bovine lens enzyme (24Del Corso A. Barsacchi D. Giannessi M. Tozzi M.G. Camici M. Houben J.L. Zandomeneghi M. Mura U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); the pure enzymes were stored at 4 °C in S-buffer supplemented with 2 mm DTT. The specific activities of r-ALR2 and its H200Q, H110Q, H41Q, H187Q, and C298S mutants were 4.5, 5.2, 0.6, 4.0, 4.0, and 5.2 units/mg, respectively. The ALR2 activity and sensitivity to inhibition by Sorbinil were measured as previously described by usingd,l-glyceraldehyde as substrate (17Cecconi I. Moroni M. Vilardo P.G. Dal Monte M. Borella P. Rastelli G. Costantino L. Garland D. Carper D. Petrash J.M. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14167-14174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Before use, the enzyme forms were extensively dialyzed against S-buffer. If not otherwise specified, copper treatment of h-ALR2 forms was performed by supplementing the enzyme after dialysis with a stoichiometric amount of NADP+. When r-ALR2 was used, 30 μm DTT was present in the dialysis buffer and 4 μm DTT was constantly present in all further incubations. All tested enzyme forms, from 3 to 8 μm final concentrations, were incubated for the proper time at 25 °C in S-buffer supplemented with CuCl2 to give final ratios of [Cu(II)]/[enzyme] from 0.5 to 5, as specifically indicated. At the end of the incubation, 0.5 mm EDTA was added and the enzyme activity was measured. To detect copper bound to ALR2, the samples were extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against S-buffer containing 0.5 mm EDTA. The concentration of Cu(I) was determined by a complexometric method as previously described (17Cecconi I. Moroni M. Vilardo P.G. Dal Monte M. Borella P. Rastelli G. Costantino L. Garland D. Carper D. Petrash J.M. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14167-14174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) by measuring the formation of the complex between the metal ion and bathocuproinedisulfonic acid. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco J40AS spectropolarimeter with a cylindrical 10-mm path length cuvette kept at 10 °C. A spectral bandwidth of 2 nm was used. To block reduced cysteines, ALR2 samples were alkylated with 1.1m iodoacetamide in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 1.25 mm EDTA, containing 6 m guanidinium chloride, pH 7.0, at room temperature for 1 min in the dark. Proteins were freed from salt and reagent excess by passing the reaction mixture through an analytical Vydac C4 column as previously reported (22Vilardo P.G. Scaloni A. Amodeo P. Barsotti C. Cecconi I. Cappiello M. Lopez Mendez B. Rullo R. Dal Monte M. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11985-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Protein samples were manually collected and lyophilized. Electrospray mass spectra of intact protein species were recorded by using an API-100 single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source as previously reported (22Vilardo P.G. Scaloni A. Amodeo P. Barsotti C. Cecconi I. Cappiello M. Lopez Mendez B. Rullo R. Dal Monte M. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11985-11994Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mass calibration was performed by means of the multiply charged ions from a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin (molecular mass 16,951.5 Da). All masses are reported as average values. Samples of carboxamidomethylated aldose reductase (150 μg) were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C in 0.4% ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C overnight, using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). ALR2 digests were analyzed using a LCQ Deca mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with an electrospray source connected to a HP1100 chromatographic system (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Peptide mixtures were separated on a narrow bore Vydac C18 column (The Separation Group) using a linear gradient from 5 to 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, over a period of 65 min, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The column effluent was split 1:1 into the mass spectrometer connected on-line. The remaining part was spectrophotometrically detected at 220 nm. In the last case, peptides were manually collected and lyophilized for further characterization. Spectra were acquired in the range m/z 250–2000. Data were elaborated using the Excalibur software provided by the manufacturer. The instrument was calibrated using a mixture of caffeine, MRFA peptide, and Ultramark 1621. A determination of the relative abundance of the peptides containing Cys80, Cys298, and Cys303 was performed as previously reported by Vinci et al. (27Vinci F. Ruoppolo M. Pucci P. Freedman R.B. Marino G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, because different peptides containing a specific Cys residue could exist, the ion current for peptides containing a specific Cys residue (in reduced or oxidized form) was obtained by summing the ion current relative to all peptides containing that cysteine (in reduced or oxidized form). To obtain the relative abundance of a specific cysteine in reduced or oxidized form, this value was divided by the ion current produced by all peptides containing Cys80, Cys298, and Cys303. Because different peptides may ionize with different efficiencies, it was not possible to evaluate the absolute abundance of each reduced or oxidized cysteine. It was, nevertheless, possible to compare the trends in the oxidation of the different cysteine residues. Automated N-terminal degradation of the purified peptides was performed by using Procise 491 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a 140C microgradient apparatus and a 785A UV detector (Applied Biosystems) for the automated identification of phenylthiohydantoin-derivative. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electrophoretic and isoelectrofocusing analyses were performed as previously described (17Cecconi I. Moroni M. Vilardo P.G. Dal Monte M. Borella P. Rastelli G. Costantino L. Garland D. Carper D. Petrash J.M. Del Corso A. Mura U. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14167-14174Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Radioactivity measurements were done using a Beckman LS5000CE scintillation counter and Optiphase Hi Safe as scintillation fluid with a counting efficiency of 50% as determined by the tritium standard quench curve of the instrument. Molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the sander_classic module of AMBER6 (29Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheathan III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L.

Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11373) Google Scholar) force field. Calculations were performed on a IBM-SP3 computer. Graphical display and manipulations were performed on Silicon Graphics O2 workstations using MIDAS (31Ferrin T.E. Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge L. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6: 13-27Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Force field parameters for copper(II) have been developed in the present work and tested on plastocyanin. An ionic (nonbonded) approach (32Hay B.P. Coord. Chem. Rev. 1993; 126: 177-236Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was adopted in modeling the metal. The van der Waals R* of copper(II) was interpolated from a linear plot of the R* values of the metal ions contained in the AMBER force field against their atomic radii (33Weast R.C. Astle M.J. Beyer W.H. Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. 66th Edition. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985–1986Google Scholar); similarly, the well depth ε was interpolated from an exponential plot of the ε values of the same metal ionsversus their atomic radii. Values of R* = 1.26 Å and ε = 0.0123 kcal/mol were obtained. The coordination geometry of copper extracted from the crystal structure of plastocyanin (34Guss J.M. Bartunik H.D. Freeman H.C. Acta Cryst. Sect. B. 1992; 48: 790-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was used for charge calculations of copper; to this aim, the Cα carbons of the four amino acids coordinating copper (His37, His87, Cys84, and Met92) were truncated with methyl groups, and cysteine was modeled as anionic (35Ryde U. Ollson M.H.M. Pierloot K. Roos B.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 36Pierloot K., De Kerpel J.O.A. Ryde U. Roos B.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 218-226Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The atomic charge of Cu(II) was obtained from an electrostatic potential fit to STO-3G and 6–31G* ab initio wave functions, using GAUSSIAN94 (37Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Gill M.W. Johnson B.G. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Keith T. Petersson G.A. Montgomery J.A. Raghavachari K., Al- Laham M.A. Zakrzewski V.G. Ortiz J.V. Gaussian94, Revision D. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1995Google Scholar), followed by standard RESP fit (38Bayly C.I. Cieplak P. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10269-10277Crossref Scopus (5352) Google Scholar, 39Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Cornell W.D. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 1357-1377Crossref Scopus (845) Google Scholar). In the first case, a STO-3G basis set for copper and the whole coordination sphere was used, whereas a mixed 6–31G* basis set for the amino acids and a STO-3G basis set for copper was used in a second case. Atomic charges of copper of +0.71 and +1.13 were obtained, respectively. In both cases, the formal +2 charge of copper turned out to be significantly reduced upon coordination. As plastocyanin might not be an appropriate model for the copper coordination in ALR2, which is unknown, charge calculations were repeated for a system comprised of copper and six coordinating water molecules, using STO-3G. We still found that the charge of copper reduces to +1.08, a finding that confirms that the charge of the metal has to be reduced from +2 in liquid simulations, regardless of the nature of the residues that coordinate the metal. To test the reliability of the present R*, ε, and charge parameters of copper, MM and MD calculations were performed on the whole plastocyanin molecule using AMBER. Hydrogens were added to the protein and then optimized, keeping the heavy atoms of the protein fixed at their original positions. Counterions were placed around the charged residues at the surface of the protein to neutralize the system. The parameters for Na+ and Cl− were taken from the works of Åqvist (40Åqvist J. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 8021-8024Crossref Scopus (1406) Google Scholar) and Jorgensen (41Jorgensen W.L. Buckner J.K. Huston S.E. Rossky P.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 1891-1899Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), respectively. Crystallographic water molecules buried inside the protein were maintained and a 15-Å spherical cap of TIP3P (42Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28658) Google Scholar) water molecules centered on copper was added, resulting in 83 additional waters. Three independent MM and MD simulations were performed by setting the charge on copper at +2 (formal charge), +1.13 (mixed 6–31G*/STO-3G), and +0.71 (ST0–3G). In each case, 3,000 steps of conjugate-gradient minimization with MM were performed on the water molecules first, followed by 10,000 steps minimization of the protein residues at 12-Å distance from copper and all the water molecules. A 10-Å cut-off for the nonbonded interactions was adopted. Molecular dynamics was performed for 100 ps at 27 °C, using SHAKE (43van Gusteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Mol. Phys. 1977; 34: 1311-1327Crossref Scopus (1560) Google Scholar) to constrain bond lengths at their equilibrium values. Coordinates were collected every 0.1 ps for analysis, with the last 20 ps averaged for analysis. The root mean square deviations between the averaged structures and the crystal structure of plastocyanin (34Guss J.M. Bartunik H.D. Freeman H.C. Acta Cryst. Sect. B. 1992; 48: 790-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) have been analyzed. Taking into account the root mean square deviation values corresponding to the backbone atoms of the protein, values of 0.50, 0.36, and 0.28 were obtained for the simulations employing the +2, +1.13, and +0.71 charge on copper, respectively. Root mean square deviations limited to the coordination sphere of copper (i.e. copper, His37, His87, Cys84, and Met92) gave a similar trend (0.47, 0.28, and 0.20 for the three simulations). Therefore, MD with the formal charge of +2 on copper gave the worst results both in terms of reproducing the crystal structure of plastocyanin and the coordination geometry of copper. In contrast, the +0.71 simulation gave the best results and this charge was used throughout for the aldose reductase simulations. As it will be shown, an ad hoc strategy was devised to simulate the modification of ALR2 as a two-step process in which copper initially forms a noncovalent complex with ALR2 and, subsequently, induces the disulfide bridge formation. Two copper ions were docked into the structure of the human ALR2 holoenzyme (44Wilson D.K. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Quiocho F.H. Science. 1992; 257: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Because Cys80, Cys298, and Cys303 are the three cysteines involved in the formation of a disulfide bridge, copper ions were initially positioned to interact with these residues. One copper ion was positioned close to Cys80 and one close to Cys303 to investigate the formation of the Cys80-Cys303 disulfide, and one copper ion was positioned close to Cys298 and one close to Cys303 for the Cys298-Cys303 disulfide. When coordinating copper, cysteines were assigned a deprotonated form (35Ryde U. Ollson M.H.M. Pierloot K. Roos B.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 36Pierloot K., De Kerpel J.O.A. Ryde U. Roos B.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 218-226Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The ALR2 structures have been prepared using a procedure similar to that described for plastocyanin, with hydrogens added and counterions placed. The parameters for the cofactor were taken from previous work. Structures were solvated with spherical caps of more than 2000 TIP3P (42Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28658) Google Scholar) water molecules centered on the center of mass of ALR2. The following protocol was adopted for minimization and dynamics. A few steps of minimization with MM were performed on the two copper ions keeping the protein fixed at its original position to adjust their initial position with respect to the two cysteines. Prior to energy minimization of ALR2, only the water molecules were energy minimized and then subjected to 50 ps of MD at 27 °C to let the solvent equilibrate around the solute. Then, 5000 steps of minimization were performed on the whole system. 300 ps of MD at 27 °C was then performed starting from the minimized structure, using the same conditions described for plastocyanin. The whole structure was allowed to move during MD. MD was continued for over 800 ps in the case of the enzyme loaded with the two copper ions close to Cys298 and Cys303. Because the sulfur atoms of Cys80 and Cys303, after the 300 ps MD with copper, turned out to be much closer than the corresponding atoms in the crystal structure of the holoenzyme, the last minimized structure obtained from the noncovalent simulation described in the force field parameter section was used as the starting point for building a covalent disulfide bond between these cysteines. Five thousand steps of minimization and 800 ps of MD at 27 °C were performed on the enzyme carrying the Cys80-Cys303 disulfide with coordinates collected for the subsequent analysis. Because, after 800 ps of MD, Cys298 and Cys303were not sufficiently close to form a disulfide in the noncovalent complexes, a different strategy was used to build a model structure carrying this disulfide. Using the homology modeling software Model er6 (45Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar), the sequence of ALR2 was artificially aligned with itself, with the only difference being that while the template did not contain any disulfide (the crystal structure of the holoenzyme), a disulfide was explicitly requested in the modeled structure. This approach produced an initial structure of ALR2 carrying the disulfide; the quality of the structure was evaluated using PROCHECK (46Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

Then, the two copper ions were docked close to Cys298 and Cys303, and the structure was refined with MM and MD using the same protocol described above. 5000 steps of minimization were performed, and the structure was equilibrated with 900 ps of MD. The recombinant h-ALR2 and r-ALR2 were readily inactivated by low concentrations of Cu(II) (Fig.1). The rate and extent of inactivation were dependent on copper ion concentration. Moreover, in both cases enzyme activity was recovered upon addition of DTT. Following incubation with CuCl2 and extensive dialysis at 4 °C against EDTA, r-ALR2 and h-ALR2 contained 1.8 ± 0.1 and 2.1 ± 0.1 equivalents of total metal ion per enzyme mole, respectively. This is consistent with that reported for the b-ALR2 (17Cecconi I. Moroni M. Vilardo P.G. Dal Monte M. Borella P. Rastelli G. Costantino L. Garland D. Carper D. Petrash J.M. Del Corso A. Mura U.

To systematically obtain insight into mechanisms of hnRNP K activities, we set out to identify protein factors that interact with hnRNP K by using glutathione S-transferase-hnRNP K affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis. Several partner proteins in the K562 cell lysates were identified through this method. One of them is a DEAD box-containing putative RNA helicase, DDX1. In vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the protein-protein interaction between hnRNP K with DDX1, and the region spanning amino acids 1–276 of hnRNP K is apparently responsible for its physical interaction with DDX1. Interestingly, their interaction was disrupted by the addition of poly(C), poly(A), and poly(U) RNA substrates. We found that DDX1 was a homopolymeric poly(A) RNA-binding protein. On the other hand, the ATPase activity of the purified recombinant DDX1 protein was stimulated by these homopolymeric RNAs and yeast total RNA but not by DNA.

These hnRNP proteins bind pre-mRNAs directly and appear to facilitate various stages of mRNA biogenesis (1Dreyfuss G. Matunis G.M. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Google Scholar, 2Weighardt F. Biamonti G. Riva S. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 747-756Google Scholar, 3Krecic A.M. Swanson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 363-371Google Scholar). hnRNP K can bind to RNA and single-stranded or double-stranded DNA. The nucleic acid binding activity of hnRNP K is mediated by three repeats of motifs termed the K homology domain, which consists of 65–70 residues (4Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Google Scholar). It contains both classical nuclear localization signal and the K nuclear shuttling domain that allow the protein to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm (5Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Google Scholar). hnRNP K appears to be involved in transcriptional regulation as exemplified by its binding to a C-rich sequence (the CT element) within the human c-mycpromoter and subsequent activation of c-myc expression (6Takimoto M. Tomonaga T. Matunis M. Avigan M. Krutzsch H. Dreyfuss G. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18249-18258Google Scholar, 7Tomonaga T. Levens D. J. Biol.

Additionally, its association with CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β results in the repression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β target genes (9Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Shen B.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Google Scholar). hnRNP K was also reported to bind 3′ end of 15-lipoxygenase, and HPV 16 L2 mRNA was reported to trigger translation inhibition (10Ostareck D.H. Ostareck-Lederer A. Wilm M. Thiele B.J. Mann M. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 597-606Google Scholar, 11Collier B. Goobar-Larsson L. Sokolowski M. Schwartz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22648-22656Google Scholar). Moreover, direct protein-protein interactions between hnRNP K and some proto-oncogene products serve as clear evidence that hnRNP K acts as a docking platform to facilitate molecular interactions within signal transduction cascades (12Bustelo X.R.

Modulation of RNA structure is an essential step in many fundamental cellular processes, including RNA synthesis, splicing, export, turnover, and translation. Recently, an increasing number of RNA helicases from different organisms, ranging from bacteria to yeast, human, and virus, has been identified (17Fuller-Pace F.V. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 271-274Google Scholar, 18Wassarman D.A. Stetz J.A. Nature. 1991; 340: 463-464Google Scholar). DEAD box proteins are a family of putative RNA helicases that are characterized by a core region of 300–360 amino acids that possesses eight conserved amino acid motifs, one of which is the ATP hydrolysis motif containing the core tetrapeptide DEX(D/H) (19Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Google Scholar). The eighth domain, HRIGRXXR, is part of a basic region and is involved in RNA binding. DEAD box proteins are assumed to be ATP-dependent RNA helicases, based on the observed in vitro RNA helicase activities of the mouse translation initiation factor eIF4A (20Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Google Scholar), the human nuclear protein p68 (21Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Google Scholar), the Xenopus An3 (22Gururajan R. Mathew L. Longo F. Weeks D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2056-2060Google Scholar), and the Drosophila vasa (23Liang L. Diehl-Jones W. Lasko P. Development. 1994; 120: 1201-1211Google Scholar). The family is growing steadily, and each member differs in its size. The specificity and properties of each protein, including subcellular localization, RNA binding specificity, and regions required for the interaction with accessory proteins, are conferred by the additional N- and C-terminal sequences (17Fuller-Pace F.V. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 271-274Google Scholar). hnRNP K is involved in multiple regulatory processes of gene expression. To gain more insight into the mechanisms of hnRNP K action, we set out to identify its associated proteins through the hnRNP K affinity column. One of them was DDX1. DDX1 (originally named HuDBP-RB for human DEAD boxprotein identified inretinoblastoma cells) was isolated from a screen for cDNA clones of transcripts preferentially expressed in the retinoblastoma cell lines (24Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Google Scholar). Co-amplification of DDX1and the proto-oncogene MYCN has been demonstrated in both retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma cell lines (24Godbout R. Squire J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7578-7582Google Scholar, 25Squire J.A. Thorner P.S. Weitzman S. Maggi J.D. Dirks P. Doyle J. Hale M. Godbout R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1417-1422Google Scholar). DDX1 protein levels in MYCN/DDX1-amplified neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma cell lines correlate well with DDX1 gene copy number and its transcript levels (26Godbout R. Packer M. Bie W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21161-21168Google Scholar). Although there have been extensive research efforts directed toward DDX1 and MYCN, the enzyme activity of DDX1 protein remains to be investigated. Here, we found that DDX1 could interact with hnRNP K and poly(A) RNA. The ATPase and RNA unwinding activities of DDX1 were also further examined and characterized. The full-length hnRNP K cDNA was cloned as described (9Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Shen B.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Google Scholar). The EcoRI fragment of hnRNP K was subcloned into pEGFP-C (Clontech) for eukaryotic GFP-hnRNP K protein expression and also subcloned into pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) for GST fusion protein production. To construct truncated mutants, the EcoRI-HindIII (amino acids 1–180), XbaI-EcoRI (amino acids 277–464),HindIII-EcoRI (amino acids 179–464), andIndIII-XbaI fragments (amino acids 179–276) were individually subcloned into both pEGFP-C (Clontech) and pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) vectors. DDX1s were cloned by RT-PCR using the specific primers (sequence shown in the following method) and K562 cDNA. After being cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, the DDX1 cDNA was further subcloned into pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene) for mammalian cell expression and pVL1392 (Pharmingen) for baculovirus/insect cell expression. Several deletion fragments including theBamHI-ScaI (amino acids 1–524),ScaI-XhoI (amino acids 525–740),BamHI-SmaI (amino acids 1–295), andEcoRI-ScaI fragments (amino acids 185–524) were subcloned into the pCMV-Tag2 vector. RT-PCR was undertaken to clone the DDX1 cDNA. This is done by using total RNA from K562 cells, ready-to-go RT-PCR (Amersham Biosciences), and specific primers for DDX1: primer A, 5′-ATGGGRGRAATGCCTGAG-3′; and primer B, 5′-GTAAATGTAAAAA- TCAGAAGG-3′ Whole cell extracts of K562 cells are prepared in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptine, and 100 μg/ml PMSF. For GST fusion protein columns, 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) carrying 5 mg of immobilized GST-hnRNP K or GST proteins are used. 100 mg of whole cell extracts are preincubated with GST-bound beads for 3 h at 4 °C, and then the flow-through was mixed with the GST-hnRNP K beads in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptine, and 100 μg/ml PMSF) for further 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes with binding buffer, stepwise elution was performed with 5 ml of binding buffer containing 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1 m NaCl. The eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Following Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, the interesting protein bands were sliced from the gel. The gel pieces were incubated with 25 mm NH4HCO3 containing trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptide mixture was applied to capillary high performance liquid chromatography (PerkinElmer-Applied Biosystems) followed by tandem mass spectrometry analysis (model LCQ mass spectrometer, Finnigan). Full-length and deletion of DDX1 proteins were translated using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) from series of constructs of pCMV-Tag2 as DNA templates. The translated proteins were [35S]Met-labeled. All GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α, and then crude lysates were prepared according to the Amersham Biosciences manual. To generate the polyclonal antibody against DDX1, the truncated protein GST-DDX1 (1–185 amino acids) was expressed. The GST-DDX1 (1–185 amino acids) fusion protein was purified for rabbit immunizations. The anti-hnRNP K antibody was produced as described previously (9Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Shen B.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose 4A beads (about 8 μl) were equilibrated in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100) and then mixed with bacterial GST fusion proteins on a rotary shaker for 20 min at room temperature. After washed three times with PBST, the beads were combined with 5 μl of in vitrotranslation product in a final volume of 200 μl of LSBT (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% Triton X-100), 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF on a rotary shaker. The mixtures incubate at 4 °C for 30 min. Finally, the beads were washed four times with LSBT containing 0.3 m NaCl and once with 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and checked by SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, the nucleic acids were added as specified. Poly(C), poly(A), poly(G), and poly(U) RNAs were purchased from Sigma. Poly(A)-Sepharose 4B and poly(C)-agarose were purchased from Sigma. The binding reactions included in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein and 10 μg of RNA resin in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and was incubated for 30 min with rotating at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer. The proteins bound to the RNA beads were released by boiling in SDS protein sample buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. Human renal 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Human erythroleukemic K562 cells and retinoblastoma Y79 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf21) were cultured in TMN-FH medium (Applichem) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 27 °C. The Sf21 cells do not require carbon dioxide supplementation. Transfection was performed by a calcium-phosphate precipitation method as described previously (9Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Shen B.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10784-10791Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses expressing FLAG-DDX1 and GFP-hnRNP K were generated by the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmingen). For recombinant protein expression, multiple 15-cm tissue culture plates were seeded with 2 × 107 Sf21 cells/plate and then kept at 27 °C overnight. The seeded cells were then infected with a high titer stock solution of recombinant baculovirus (minimum titer 1 × 108 virus particles/ml). After incubating at 27 °C for 3 days, the cells were harvested and spun down at 2,500 rpm. Whole cell extracts were prepared. To prepare whole cell extract, 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml papstatin A, and 100 μg/ml PMSF). The cell suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. The protein concentration was estimated by Bio-Rad protein assay. The cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG beads for 4 h in the binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) at 4 °C. The resulting immune complexes were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.2 or 0.5m NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% or 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or further elution. The complexes were eluted by 0.5 μg/μl FLAG peptide in three successive fractions of appropriate volume. The quantities of the eluted samples were checked by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Then the samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for further assays. The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to Hybond-C membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and Western blotting was done using anti-GFP or anti-DDX1 antibody. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 10 μl, which contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and various amounts of protein samples and, unless otherwise stated, polynucleotides. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. One microliter of the reaction product was spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (Merck). The chromatography was performed in 0.375 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, and analyzed by autoradiography. The relative amounts of free radioactive phosphate in the reaction mixture were evaluated from the dried plates using a Fujifilm BAS 1000 phosphorus imager. The RNAs used in unwinding assays were prepared as follows: A, pSP64/poly(A) vector (Promega) was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase; B, pGEM3 vector (Promega) was linearized with BamHI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase; C, pGEM3 vector was linearized withEcoRI and transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase; and D, pGEM3 vector was linearized with SmaI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase. RNA probes B and D were incorporated with [α-32P]UTP. Two sets of RNA fragments, A and B or C and D, were annealed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl after boiling for 5 min and cooling down gradually to 30 °C. RNA unwinding assay was performed as described (27Tseng S.S.-I. Weaver P.L. Liu Y. Hitomi M. Tartakoff A.M. Chang T.-H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2651-2662Google Scholar). 40 fmol of duplex RNA in a 10-μl reaction containing 17 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 0.3% PEG 8,000, 1 mm ATP, 40 units of RNasin, 1 μg of tRNA, and the indicated proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. One μl of stop buffer (10 mg/ml proteinase K, 5% SDS) was then added to terminate the reaction and further incubated for 15 min. The reactions were analyzed by 10% native polyacrylamide gel (40:1) electrophoresis. To investigate the proteins that may interact with hnRNP K, we performed GST-hnRNP K affinity chromatography using proleukemic K562 whole cell extracts. The protein fractions from control GST and GST-hnRNP K chromatography are separated on SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig.1 A). Several specific protein bands were identified through comparison between the protein fractions from GST and GST-hnRNP K columns. These specific polypeptides purified from the GST-hnRNP K column were subsequently trypsinized and fractionated by capillary HPLC. Fractions eluted from the capillary HPLC column were directly analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Several proteins were identified by this method (Fig. 1 B). We were particularly interested in one of them, the putative RNA helicase termed DDX1, because of the increasingly important role of helicases in mRNA maturation and translation and their potential functional link to hnRNP K. All eight conserved motifs characteristic of DEAD box proteins are present in DDX1. To further explore the physical and functional interaction between hnRNP K and DDX1, we first cloned the complete open reading frame of DDX1 by RT-PCR. To test whether DDX1 directly interacts with hnRNP K, pull-down assay and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. By using GST pull-down assay, the in vitrotranslated DDX1 protein was tested for binding to the GSH beads prebound with GST or GST-hnRNP K. The results, as shown in Fig.2 A, indicate that the in vitro translated DDX1 could associate with GST-hnRNP K. The molecular weights of GST-hnRNP K and DDX1 are very similar, hence a doublet of protein bands was visible on the gel when the GST-hnRNP K was abundant. Because both hnRNP K and DDX1 have RNA-binding domains, their interaction might be mediated through RNA binding. However, we observed that the interaction between hnRNP K with DDX1 seemed to be better in the presence of RNase A (data not shown). To further clarify the possible effects of RNA on their interaction, the binding of35S-labeled DDX1 to GST-hnRNP K was performed in the presence of several homopolymeric RNAs. Poly(C), poly(A), and poly(U) weakened the interaction of DDX1 with hnRNP K, whereas poly(G) did not affect this binding (Fig. 2 B). To further establish the in vivo interaction between DDX1 and hnRNPK, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using cell lysates derived from 293T cells and insect cells. Whole cell extracts from FLAG-hnRNP K-expressed 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody beads and analyzed by Western blotting with antibody against DDX1. DDX1 protein was found to co-immunoprecipitate with FLAG-hnRNP K (Fig. 3 A). In addition, insect cell Sf21 were co-infected with viruses expressing recombinant FLAG-tagged DDX1 and GFP-tagged hnRNP K. In this system, hnRNP K was also detected through immunoblotting as a component of the FLAG-tagged immunocomplex (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, theses results indicate that DDX1 can interact with hnRNPK bothin vitro and in vivo. To map the interacting region within hnRNP K that facilitates binding to DDX1, we generated a series of deletion mutants of the hnRNP K protein. Whole cell extracts of 293T cells previously transfected with various GFP-hnRNP K derivatives were next incubated with anti-FLAG beads preabsorbed with FLAG-DDX1. The in vitro binding was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.4 A, DDX1 was found to co-precipitate with the K (1–464), K (1–180), K (179–276), and K (179–464) constructs, but no binding was observed with the K (277–464) mutant and control GFP protein. GST pull-down assay yielded the same results (Fig. 4 B). These data pinpoint the DDX1 interaction region of hnRNP K to an area between amino acids 1 and 276. Using a panel of DDX1 deletion mutants, we next mapped the region within DDX1 that is responsible for binding to hnRNP K. The results of the in vitro binding assay (shown in Fig.5) demonstrate that two separate regions of DDX1, amino acids 1–295 ands amino acids 525–740, can independently bind to hnRNP K, although their relative binding efficiencies are lower than that of full-length DDX1. Fig. 2 B showed that the interaction of DDX1 with hnRNP K could be interfered by the presence of poly(A), poly(C), and poly(U) homopolymeric RNAs. Because poly(A) RNA has never been mentioned to affect interaction between hnRNP K and other associated proteins, we tested whether DDX1 can bind to poly(A) RNA. RNA binding assay showed that DDX1 bound to poly(A) beads but not to poly(C) beads (Fig.6 A, lanes 1–3). The RNA-binding domain-deleted mutant of DDX1 lost the RNA binding activity (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4–6). Consistent with a previous report (28Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Google Scholar), hnRNP K possessed a specific poly(C) RNA binding ability (Fig. 6 A, lanes 7–9). Fig. 6 Bshowed that DDX1 could be brought down by poly(A) beads from the Y79 cytoplasm extracts. Interestingly, we noticed that hnRNP K was absent in this DDX1-containing poly(A) RNA-binding protein complexes (lane 2) and vice versa (lane 3). Most but not all of the DEAD box proteins have ATPase activity. DDX1 protein has an ATPase motif similar to other DEAD box proteins. However, the ATPase activity of the purified DDX1 protein has not been fully characterized. Recombinant FLAG-hnRNP K was expressed in 293T cells, and recombinant FLAG-DDX1 was expressed in Sf21 insect cells (Fig.7 A). To examine the ATPase activity in vitro, [γ-32P]ATP was incubated along with FLAG-DDX1, and ATP hydrolysis was measured based on the production of [32P]phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP as observed on the polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates. As shown in Fig. 7 B, recombinant protein DDX1 was found to possess ATPase in the presence of various polynucleotides. We compared the stimulatory effect of a variety of RNAs and DNAs on such enzymatic activity. Generally speaking, the ATPase activity of DDX1 was stimulated efficiently by poly(A), poly(U), poly(C), and total RNA from yeast (1.5–3.7-fold increases from the initial rates in the absence of polynucleotides), whereas DNA and poly(G) had no effect and even an inhibitory effect on the ATPase activity of DDX1, respectively. We have demonstrated that hnRNP K can form a complex with DDX1 in cell lysates (Fig. 3). We further examined the ATPase activity of hnRNP K-DDX1 complex. Overexpressed FLAG-K (full-length) or truncated FLAG-K (277–464, a DDX1-interacting mutant as shown in Fig. 4) from 293T cell lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody agarose. After washes with high salt or low salt buffer, the protein complexes were eluted with FLAG peptide and were subjected to Western blot and ATPase assays. The result showed that under the low salt wash condition the full-length hnRNP K could bring down the DDX1 but truncated hnRNP K could not and that the co-immunoprecipitated DDX1 had ATPase activity. Under the more stringent conditions, hnRNP K could not interact with DDX1, and thus no ATPase activity was detected from the eluents (Fig.8). Several DEAD box proteins exhibit RNA unwinding activities in vitro. To evaluate the RNA helicase activity of DDX1, we carried out the RNA unwinding activity assay by first immobilizing DDX1 or hnRNP K immunocomplexes on protein A-Sepharose by anti-DDX1 or anti-hnRNP K antibody, respectively, and subsequent incubation with duplex RNA. Two pairs of duplex RNA were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the RNA pair (A + B) has 30 bases of rATP overhangs. Fig. 9 showed that recombinant DDX1 alone exhibited no RNA unwinding activity (lanes 7 and 8), but protein complexes co-immunoprecipitated by DDX1 (lane 5) were able to reconstitute the RNA unwinding activity on the duplex RNA (A + B) in vitro. ATP is required in this reaction (data not shown). Compared with the activity of DDX1 complexes, that of immunoprecipitated hnRNP K protein complexes was very weak (lane 6). The fundamental processes of the eukaryotic cell, such as transcription initiation, RNA metabolism, replication, and DNA repair, are catalyzed by multiple protein complexes consisting of up to many dozens of subunits that possess enzymatic as well as regulatory functions. To learn more about the molecular mechanisms of these processes and the nature of the multiprotein complexes involved, the identification of their subunits and the characterization of their interaction are essential. hnRNP K is a component of the hnRNP complex, and a large amount of literature has implicated it in the regulation of gene expression on different levels. Although many hnRNP K-interacting proteins have been identified (8Michelotti E.F. Michelotti G.A. Aronsohn A.I. Levens D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2350-2360Google Scholar, 12Bustelo X.R. Suen K.L.

DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 569-577Google Scholar), the exact roles of hnRNP K-containing complexes in gene expression regulation are currently unclear. In this study, we identified a putative RNA helicase DDX1 from GST-hnRNP K affinity chromatography as a new hnRNP K-interacting factor. The GST binding assay and immunoprecipitation analysis further confirmed the physical interaction between these two proteins. RNA helicases have been thought to be ATP-driven switches for modulating RNA secondary structure or for rearranging RNA-protein complexes (33Linder P. Tanner N.K. Banroques J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 339-341Google Scholar). We thus hypothesize that DDX1 may assist hnRNP K and/or hnRNPs during RNA processing steps. There are reports describing the nucleic acid-mediated interaction between hnRNP K and certain associated proteins. Poly(C) RNA, which binds to hnRNP K, blocked Zik1 binding to hnRNP K, whereas poly(A), which does not bind to hnRNP K, did not affect such binding (29Denisenko O.N. O'Neill B. Ostrowski J. Seuningen I.V. Bomszztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27701-27706Google Scholar). Poly(U) decreased the interaction of YB-1 with hnRNP K, whereas the other polynucleotides had no effect (30Shnyreva M. Schullery D.S. Suzuki H. Higaki Y. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 15498-15503Google Scholar). Previously, we also reported that the interaction between hnRNP K and the dengue virus core protein was altered in the presence of poly(C) and poly(U) (32Chang C.J. Luh H.W. Wang S.H. Lin H.J. Lee S.C. Hu S.T. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 569-577Google Scholar). Fig. 4 showed that the DDX1-interacting region in hnRNP K contains the N-terminal K homology or RGG domain that is known to confer nucleic acid binding. We performed the binding experiments in the presence of polyhomonucleic acids and found that the interaction of DDX1 and hnRNP K was weakened in the presence of poly(C), poly(A), and poly(U) (Fig. 2 B). We further demonstrated that DDX1 could bind to poly(A), presumably sequence to facilitate its RNA unwinding activity. Fig. 6 Bshows that binding of DDX1 to poly(A) and hnRNP K or of hnRNP K to poly(C) and DDX1 seemed to be mutually exclusive. It suggests that protein-protein interactions of DDX1 and hnRNP K could modulate their RNA binding activity and subsequently regulate their biological functions. The biological function of DDX1 is not known. Recently, Bleoo et al. (34Bleoo S. Sun X. Hendzel M.J. Rowe J.M. Packer M. Godbout R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3046-3059Google Scholar) reported that DDX1 associated with a pre-mRNA 3′ end cleavage protein CstF-64. With our new finding that DDX1 is one of the poly(A) RNA binding proteins, it can be postulated that DDX1 is involved in the 3′ end processing of pre-mRNA. Most DEAD box family proteins have been reported to be associated with ATP hydrolysis activity, and for many of them the activity is RNA-dependent. Although RNA binding assay showed that DDX1 preferred to bind to poly(A), the ATPase activity of recombinant DDX1 was stimulated by several RNAs (such as poly(A), poly(U), poly(C), and yeast total RNA) to various degrees (Fig. 7). Among the known DEAD box proteins, only some have RNA substrate specificity, and most of them either do not have any substrate specificity or have specificities that are unrelated to their assumed in vivo roles. For example, mammalian eIF4A, which is required for translation initiation of all mRNA, is stimulated more efficiently by poly(U) than by globin mRNA (20Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Google Scholar). For E. coli DbpA and yeast Slt22, only specific RNA can stimulate their ATP hydrolysis activity (23 rRNA and U2/U6 small nuclear RNA, respectively) (35Fuller-Pace F.V. Nicol S.M. Reid A.D. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3619-3626Google Scholar, 36Xu D. Nouraini S. Field D. Tang S.-J. Friesen J.D. Nature. 1996; 381: 709-713Google Scholar). However, the in vivo substrates of these proteins may be more complex and thus cannot fully be inferred from the in vitro experiments. This implicates that substrate determination of RNA helicases is complicated and is most likely dependent on other RNA helicase-associated factors. This is also consistent with no helicase activity of recombinant DDX1. Only some of DEAD box-containing proteins (eIF-4A, p68, vasa, An3, and others) have been shown to have both ATP hydrolysis and RNA helicase activities in vitro (17Fuller-Pace F.V. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 271-274Google Scholar). Most RNA helicases unwind dsRNA in either a 5′ to 3′ or a 3′ to 5′ direction when tested in vitro. The designed substrates provide the double-stranded region with either 5′ or 3′ single-stranded overhangs (19Tanner N.K. Linder P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 251-262Google Scholar). These overhangs enable the helicase to load onto the substrate. Our data indicate that purified recombinant DDX1 does not possess RNA unwinding activity, but the immunoprecipitated DDX1 complexes exhibit such activity to unwind a substrate with poly(A) overhang. This finding implies that, just like eIF-4A (20Rozen F. Edery I. Meerovitch K. Dever T.E. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1134-1144Google Scholar) and Dbp5p (27Tseng S.S.-I. Weaver P.L. Liu Y. Hitomi M. Tartakoff A.M. Chang T.-H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2651-2662Google Scholar), DDX1 requires co-factors to unwind RNA duplexes. It was also demonstrated that DDX1 exhibits its RNA unwinding activity only for a specific RNA substrate, as previously observed in the case of An3 (37Gururajan R. Weeks D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 169-182Google Scholar). Taken together, DDX1 may function as a RNA helicase in the presence of a specific RNA substrate and other potential accessory proteins. The enzymatic properties of DDX1 will be further investigated. hnRNP K is up-regulated in SV40-transformed cells (38Dejgaard K. Leffers H. Rasmussen H.H. Madsen P. Kruse T.A. Gesser B. Nielsen H. Celis J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 33-48Google Scholar) and in human breast cancer, and it positively controls the growth rate of human breast cancer cells (39Mandal M. Vadlamudi R. Nguyen D. Wang R.-A. Costa L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mendelsohn J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9699-9704Google Scholar). DDX1 is co-amplified with MYCN in several retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma cells and may be involved in either the formation or the progression of a subset of these tumors. Thus, the interaction of hnRNP K with DDX1 and the associated RNA unwinding activity may play significant roles in the physiology of both normal and tumor cells.

Contrary to the rapid activation of PLA2s during the inflammatory response, death-associated AA release is a late event occurring downstream of mitochondrial changes and effector caspase activation (7Wissing D.

The PLA2 activity is found in several enzymes that can be classified based on their Ca2+ dependence into secretory PLA2s, which require Ca2+ at mmlevels, cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s), which require Ca2+ at μm levels and display specificity for phospholipids containing AA in the sn-2 position, Ca2+-independent PLA2s (iPLA2s), and platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolases. The definition of the role of individual PLA2 enzymes in cell death has been based mainly on the ability of pharmacological inhibitors to confer protection. The obtained data suggesting that iPLA2 and cPLA2 mediate cell death induced by anti-Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or oxidative stress, respectively (5Thorne T.E. Voelkel-Johanson C. Casey W.M.

McHowat J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 793-799PubMed Google Scholar). Instead, they cross-react with several PLA2s and possibly even with other enzymes like cyclo-oxygenase. Genetic evidence support, however, a role for cPLA2 in cell death and tissue injury. Mice deficient for cPLA2α show reduced post-ischemic tissue injury and resistance to brain injury induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6,-tetrahyropyride (8Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R.

Thorne T.E. Laster S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 201-207PubMed Google Scholar). TNF is a multifunctional cytokine that can elicit several biological responses like apoptosis, inflammation, and stress response (15Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar, 16Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). TNF-induced apoptosis is triggered by the activation of caspase-8 at the receptor complex. Caspase-8 can either directly or via a mitochondrial amplification pathway activate downstream effector caspases, including caspase-3, which execute the apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, TNF-induced AA release in tumor cells depends on caspase activation (7Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jäättelä M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all cathepsin-mediated cell death models, cathepsins translocate from the lysosomes into the cytosol before cathepsin-mediated morphological changes (25Leist M. Jäättelä M.

This study was designed to investigate the role of cathepsin B in TNF-induced AA release in cells dying either in caspase-dependent or -independent manner and to study the role of individual PLA2 enzymes and their cleavage in TNF-induced cell death. For this purpose we analyzed the effect of various well characterized protease inhibitors on TNF-induced AA release, cytotoxicity, and cleavage of PLA2s in three TNF-sensitive tumor cell lines. The results obtained were confirmed genetically by employing immortalized/transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs) from wild type, cathepsin B-, cPLA2-, or caspase-3-deficient mice or by expressing ectopic cPLA2or its noncleavable mutants in MCF-7S1 cells lacking the endogenous enzyme.

The deletion of the cDNA encoding either the C-terminal 227 amino acids (cPLA2-N) or N-terminal 522 amino acids (cPLA2-C) of human cPLA2 was performed by PCR with pBSII-cPLA2 as a template. Subsequently, the obtained cDNAs with or without N-terminal FLAG-tag (GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG) were subcloned between HindIII and NotI sites of multicloning sites of pN1 (pEGFP-N1 from Clontech without EGFP) or pEBS7 vectors by PCR. The expected sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. To create pCEP-vimentin, cDNA encoding vimentin (kindly provided by Nobuhiro Morishima, Saitama, Japan) was subcloned into the multicloning site of pCEP4-puro vector (the pCEP4 vector from Invitrogen with a replacement of the hygromycin resistance gene with the puromycin resistance gene from pBABE-puro). pcDNA3-neo was from Invitrogen, and pcDNA-casp3 was kindly provided by Vishva Dixit (Ann Arbor, MI). The transfections of MCF-7S1 cells with the indicated plasmids were performed by electroporation as described previously (11Jäättelä M. Benedict M. Tewari M. Shayman J.A. Dixit V.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2297-2305PubMed Google Scholar). Two days later successfully transfected cells were selected by adding 150 μg/ml hygromycin, 200 μg/ml G418, and/or 5 μg/ml puromycin. Experiments were performed with cell pools that had been in culture for 1–3 weeks. Transient transfections of WEHI-S cells were performed using LipofectAMINE plus reagents (Invitrogen). The survival and cell death of cells were analyzed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction and lactate dehydrogenase release assays as described (22Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jäättelä M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting reagents (AmershamBiosciences). To obtain cPLA2-specific antisera, rabbits were immunized with ovalbumin-coupled peptides (CPDPYVELFISTTPDSRK sequence, corresponding to amino acids 42–58 or CSVSLSNVEARRFFNKEFLSKPKA, corresponding to amino acids 726–749 of human cPLA2 sequence) at Neosystem. The obtained polyclonal antisera recognizing the N-terminal or the C-terminal part of cPLA2 are referred to as anti-cPLA2-N and anti-cPLA2-C, respectively. Other primary antibodies used included polyclonal rabbit antiserum, recognizing a C-terminal sequence of iPLA2 (Cayman Chemical), goat polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and murine monoclonal antibodies against cathepsin B (Oncogene Research Products), FLAG (anti-FLAG®M2, Sigma), and Hsc70 (clone N69, kindly provided by Boris A. Margulis, St. Petersburg, Russia). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO A/S. Two days after the transfections of 6 × 106 WEHI-S cells with the indicated plasmids, cells were stimulated with TNF and/or zVAD-fmk for 8 h, and the ectopic FLAG-cPLA2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Briefly, cells were harvested by scraping, washed once in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of Tris lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.7) containing protease inhibitors, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After centrifugation of the thawed lysate (14.000 × g for 10 min), the supernatant was precleared by incubation with 50 μl of a 50% solution of protein G-SepharoseTM beads (AmershamBiosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were removed by centrifugation, 0.95 μl of anti-FLAG-antibody was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was rotated for 18 h at 4 °C. 60 μl of Sephadex protein G beads (50% in phosphate-buffered saline) was added, and the rotation was continued for an additional 2 h. The beads were washed 5 times with Tris lysis buffer, dissolved in 70 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Recombinant cPLA2 (200 ng; kindly provided by M. Gelb, Seattle, Washington) was mixed with cathepsin B, cathepsin L (both from Enzyme Systems Products), or caspase-3 (R&D) in the indicated buffers. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1 h, terminated by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting. The following protease buffers were used: cathepsin B reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 4 mmEDTA, 8 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mmPefablock, pH 6.0); cathepsin L reaction buffer (4 m urea, 20 mm sodium acetate, 4 mm EDTA, 8 mm DTT, 1 mm Pefablock, pH 5.0), or caspase-3 reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm Pefablock, pH 7.5). The analysis of AA release was done essentially as described previously employing cells prelabeled with [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]AA (0.25 μCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (28Jäättelä M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4286-4294PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity released from cells treated with TNF and protease inhibitors was compared with that from cells incubated with protease inhibitors alone. The spontaneous AA release was always less than 15% of the total. 3H released from cells killed by freezing and thawing did not differ significantly from the spontaneous release, indicating that all the radioactive AA was incorporated into the membranes and did not get released by unspecific lysis of the cells. To measure the PLA2 activity in the lysates of transfected cells, cells (5 × 106 cells/ml) were resuspended in a lysis buffer (80 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm ammonium(meta)vanadate, and 4 mm DTT), and the cytosolic fraction was isolated by sonication and centrifugation. The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a total volume of 525 μl containing 100 μl of cytosolic cell lysate and 50 pmol of 1-stearoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonoylphosphatidylcholine (55 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in a reaction buffer (80 mmKCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 4.7 mm Ca2+, 5 mm DTT, and 200 μg bovine serum albumin) and terminated by the addition of 750 μl of stop solution (chlorophorm/methanol/10 m hydrochloric acid (volume 2:1:0.01), 0.05% butylated hydroxytoluene, and 0.1 mg/ml of mouse liver lipid (kindly provided by G. Hiller). After vortexing, the lipid phase was added to a silica acid (Merck) column equilibrated with 1 ml of chloroform, and phospholipids were eluted with 2.1 ml of methanol. Eluates of both free fatty acids and phospholipids were air-dried and mixed with 3 ml of Ecosint A scintillation fluid and counted in a scintillation counter. In TNF-sensitive human tumor cells, TNF-induced PLA2 activation as well as the release of cysteine cathepsins from lysosomes into the cytosol are dependent on caspase activity (7Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jäättelä M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jäättelä M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). To test whether cysteine cathepsins and PLA2 are in the same caspase-dependent signaling pathway, we tested the effect of various protease inhibitors on TNF-induced PLA2activity. Treatment of MCF-7S1 cells with 20 ng/ml TNF for 18 h triggered a 2.5-fold increase in AA release as compared with untreated cells. As expected, inhibition of caspases by zVAD-fmk, DEVD-CHO, or IETD-CHO almost completely inhibited TNF-induced AA release in MCF-7S1 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1 A). In addition to caspase inhibitors, also a broad spectrum cysteine cathepsin inhibitor (zFA-fmk) and a more specific inhibitor of cathepsin B (CA-074-Me) partially inhibited TNF-induced AA release. Similarly, zVAD-fmk, DEVD-CHO, and CA-074-Me effectively inhibited TNF-induced 2.1-fold increase in AA release in ME-180as human cervix carcinoma cells (Fig. 1 B). Except for CA-074-Me-treated MCF-7S1 cells dying as effectively as untreated cells despite the significantly reduced AA release, the ability of all other protease inhibitors to inhibit PLA2-like activity correlated well with their ability to inhibit TNF-induced cell death (Fig. 1,A and B). These data indicate that caspases and cathepsin B are upstream of both PLA2 activation and death in ME-180as cells, whereas in MCF-7S1 cells cathepsin B activity is required for TNF-induced PLA2 activation but not death. Other cysteine cathepsins than cathepsin B appear, however, to contribute to TNF-induced execution of MCF-7S1 cells because a broad-spectrum cysteine cathepsin inhibitor, zFA-fmk, was partially protective (Fig. 1 A). We could unfortunately not investigate the role of PLA2-like activity in TNF-induced death of human tumor cells, because PLA2 inhibitors were highly toxic to these cells. The ability of CA-074-Me to inhibit TNF-induced PLA2 activation without inhibiting death indicated, however, that AA release is not required for TNF-induced death in MCF-7S1 cells. Careful titration of protease inhibitor concentrations to obtain specific inhibition of caspases has revealed that contrary to MCF-7S1 and ME-180as cells, TNF-induced death of WEHI-S murine fibrosarcoma cells as well as that of several other fibroblast-derived murine cells is enhanced by caspase-8 inhibition (19Khwaja A. Tatton L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36817-36823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jäättelä M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These data prompted us to reevaluate our earlier data suggesting that the TNF-induced AA release in WEHI-S cells is caspase-dependent (7Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jäättelä M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To avoid the inhibition of other cysteine proteases than the caspases, we used zVAD-fmk at concentrations from 1 to 5 μm that were sufficient to inhibit the TNF-induced caspase-8 activation (demonstrated by the inhibition of the autocatalytic processing of caspase-8 into an ∼43-kDa intermediate fragment) without having a significant effect on cysteine cathepsins or calpains (22Foghsgaard L. Wissing D. Mauch D. Lademann U. Bastholm L. Boes M. Elling F. Leist M. Jäättelä M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). As demonstrated earlier, the inhibition of caspases by 1–5 μm zVAD-fmk sensitized WEHI-S cells to cytotoxicity induced by 100 pg/ml TNF (Fig.1 C). This sensitization was accompanied by a significant increase in AA release. Higher zVAD-fmk concentrations (≥50 μm) that in addition to caspases effectively inhibit cathepsin B and other cysteine cathepsins completely inhibited both TNF-induced AA release and cell death. The inhibition of cathepsin B activity by CA-074-Me also effectively attenuated TNF-induced cell death and AA release in WEHI-S cells. Furthermore, the enhanced death and PLA2-like activity induced by the combination of TNF and zVAD-fmk were effectively inhibited by CA-074-Me. In addition to cysteine cathepsin inhibitors, an antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole blocked both death and AA release induced by TNF in WEHI-S cells (Fig.1 C). As demonstrated earlier in slightly different experimental conditions (7Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Egeblad M. Poirier G.G. Jäättelä M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5073-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the inhibition of PLA2-like activity by 20 μm AACOCF3 also conferred nearly complete protection to WEHI-S cells against cytotoxicity induced by a 12-h treatment with 100 pg/ml TNF (not shown). These data suggest that a cathepsin B-dependent but caspase-independent PLA2 activity is required for TNF-induced cytotoxicity to occur in WEHI-S cells. To test genetically whether cathepsin B really is required for the TNF-induced activation of PLA2-like enzymes, we compared the ability of TNF to induce AA release in iMEFs originating from wild type and cathepsin B-deficient mice (26Deussing J. Roth W. Saftig P. Peters C. Ploegh H.L. Villadangos J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). TNF induced a dose-dependent release of AA in wild type iMEFs at concentrations ranging from 10 pg/ml to 1 ng/ml (Fig. 2 A). Contrary to wild type cells, no AA release was detected after stimulation of cathepsin B-deficient iMEFs with 10 or 100 pg/ml TNF. At a higher concentration (1 ng/ml) TNF induced some AA release also in cathepsin B-deficient iMEFs, but this release was significantly less than in wild type iMEFs. The differences in TNF-induced AA release between these cell lines reflected differences in their sensitivity to TNF-induced cytotoxicity (Fig. 2 B). Both iPLA2 and cPLA2can trigger the release of AA, and both enzymes have been implicated in death receptor-induced cell death (1Cummings B.S. McHowat J. Schnellmann R.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 793-799PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the expression of cPLA2 and iPLA2 proteins in cell lines used in this study. WEHI-S cells and iMEFs expressed high levels of cPLA2 but no detectable iPLA2 (Fig.3 A). A similar expression pattern was observed in murine brain, whereas spleen contained both cPLA2 and iPLA2, and thymus, testis, and lung tissues expressed mainly iPLA2. MCF-7S1 cells expressed iPLA2, but no cPLA2, and ME-180as cells expressed both isoforms (Fig. 3 B). Both cPLA2 and iPLA2 have been reported to be cleaved by caspases during apoptosis (9Atsumi G. Murakami M. Kojima K. Hadano A. Tajima M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18248-18258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ectopic and endogenous cPLA2 was effectively cleaved in TNF-treated MCF-cPLA2 and ME-180as cells, respectively, into an ∼64 kDa N-terminal fragment and a 32-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig.3 B, not shown). Even though the amount of full-length iPLA2 was slightly reduced in TNF-treated ME-180as and MCF-cPLA2 cells, we failed to detect any cleavage product in these samples. Because caspase-3-mediated cleavage of cPLA2 at Asp522 inactivates the enzyme, we speculated that zVAD-fmk-mediated enhancement of TNF-induced cytotoxicity and AA release could be due to the inhibition of cPLA2 cleavage. However, the increase in TNF-triggered AA release and death induced by 1 μm zVAD-fmk was surprisingly accompanied by an increase in cPLA2 cleavage (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, CA-074-Me,"

The entry process is initiated when the HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 associates with CD4 (3Klatzmann D. Champagne E. Chamaret S. Gruest J. Guetard D. Hercend T. Gluckman J.C. Montagnier L. Nature. 1984; 312: 767-768Google Scholar). This association induces in gp120 a conformational change that allows for a subsequent association with CCR5 (5Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R.

Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Google Scholar). Association with CCR5 is thought to promote a global rearrangement of the transmembrane component of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp41 that allows the amino-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 to interact with the target cell membrane. Subsequent conformational changes in gp41 are proposed to induce the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes and the entry of the viral capsid into the target cell (7Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Google Scholar). HIV-1 isolates differ in their coreceptor usage, and these differences are associated with different stages of infection in vivo(8Connor R.I. Sheridan K.E. Ceradini D. Choe S. Landau N.R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 621-628Google Scholar). Horizontally transmitted viruses and those that predominate in natural infection, so-called R5 isolates, utilize CCR5 as a coreceptor. Coincident with a decline of immune function, R5X4 isolates may emerge that utilize CXCR4 in addition to CCR5 as a coreceptor. HIV-1 isolates (X4 isolates) adapted to immortalized cell lines typically use CXCR4 as their primary or sole coreceptor (4Feng Y. Broder C.C. Kennedy P.E. Berger E.A. Science. 1996; 272: 872-877Google Scholar). The natural chemokine ligands of CCR5: MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, block the association with CCR5 of gp120 derived from R5 isolates and inhibit the infection of CCR5-expressing target cells by R5 isolates (9Cocchi F. DeVico A.L. Garzino-Demo A. Arya S.K. Gallo R.C. Lusso P. Science. 1995; 270: 1811-1815Google Scholar). Similarly, stromal derived factor-1, the sole identified ligand of CXCR4, inhibits HIV-1 infection of CXCR4-expressing target cells by X4 isolates (10Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C.

These additional coreceptors, most of which are chemokine receptors, share little obvious sequence similarity in their external domains. They do, however, have in common an amino-terminal region rich in tyrosines and acidic amino acids (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Google Scholar). This region of CCR5 plays a critical role in its ability to support the entry of R5 isolates (22Farzan M. Choe H. Vaca L. Martin K. Sun Y. Desjardins E. Ruffing N., Wu, L. Wyatt R. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1160-1164Google Scholar). The tyrosine residues in the CCR5 amino terminus are post-translationally modified by sulfate, and these sulfate moieties contribute substantially to the ability of CCR5 to support HIV-1 entry (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Google Scholar). Sulfated peptides based on this tyrosine-sulfated domain of the CCR5 amino terminus, but not their unsulfated analogs, can slow HIV-1 entry and also, less efficiently, block the association of MIP-1α with CCR5 (23Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C. Dragic T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5762-5767Google Scholar, 24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar). Here we show that the same tyrosine-sulfated peptides, but again not their unsulfated analogs, can complement the HIV-1 coreceptor activity of a CCR5 variant lacking its amino-terminal tyrosine-sulfated domain. Tyrosine-sulfated peptides also enabled this CCR5 variant to mobilize calcium in the presence of MIP-1α and MIP-1β. We also present data demonstrating that X4 isolates are substantially less dependent on the amino terminus of CXCR4 than are R5 isolates on the analogous region of CCR5. These data underscore the functional importance of sulfate moieties in CCR5 function, highlight a distinction between CXCR4- and CCR5-mediated HIV-1 entry, and imply that a tyrosine-sulfated region of CCR5 mediates association of the natural and viral ligands of CCR5 with the remainder of the CCR5 receptor. Reconstitution of CCR5 function in this manner will be useful in further structural and functional studies of CCR5 and other G protein-coupled receptors. Plasmids encoding codon-optimized CCR5 and CXCR4 in a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) have been described previously (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

Similarly, a plasmid encoding the CXCR4 variant ΔNX4 was generated by deleting CXCR4 codons 2–25 in the same manner. Plasmids were sequenced in their entire coding region to exclude the possibility of unintended changes. HEK293T human kidney cells and Cf2Th canine thymocytes were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture collection (CRL11554 and CRL1430, respectively). Cf2Th cells stably expressing CCR5 (CCR5-Cf2Th cells) or CD4 (CD4-Cf2Th cells) have been described previously (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Google Scholar). Cf2Th cells stably expressing the CCR5 variant ΔNR5 (ΔNR5-Cf2Th cells) were made in the same way. Briefly, Cf2Th cells were transfected with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid encoding the ΔNR5 variant, selected in 1.5 mg/ml G418, and cloned by limiting dilution. Clones with high surface expression of the ΔNR5 receptors were identified by FACS analysis using the anti-CCR5 antibody 2D7 (Pharmingen). The peptides used in these studies were synthesized and purified (>95% pure) by the American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA). The amino acid sequence of the s22 peptide (MDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEPSQK) is identical to the 22 amino-terminal residues of CCR5, except that cysteine 20 of CCR5 has been altered to serine; tyrosines 10 and 14 were synthesized as tyrosine sulfate, as indicated by underlining (24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar). The c22 peptide is identical to the s22 peptide, except that the tyrosines at positions 10 and 14 are unsulfated. The s13 peptide (SSPIYDINYYTSE) corresponds to residues 6–18 of CCR5; tyrosines 10 and 14 were again synthesized as tyrosine sulfate. The c5aR-s22 peptide (TTPDYGHYDDKDTLDLNTPVDK) corresponds to residues 7–28 of the human C5a receptor, with tyrosine 10 and 14 synthesized as tyrosine sulfate (43Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Kuhn J. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Choe H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1059-1066Google Scholar). Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9) at a concentration of 20 μg/μl. The envelope complementation assay used here has been described previously (1Choe H. Farzan M. Sun Y. Sullivan N. Rollins B. Ponath P.D., Wu, L. Mackay C.R. LaRosa G. Newman W. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Cell. 1996; 85: 1135-1148Google Scholar, 26Helseth E. Kowalski M.

Briefly, HIV-1 proviral DNA lacking a functional envelope gene and encoding chloramphenicol acetyltranferase as a reporter was cotranfected into HEK293T cells with plasmids encoding the envelope glycoproteins of the R5 isolates ADA and YU2, the R5X4 isolate 89.6, or the X4 isolate HXBc2 HIV-1. Viruses harvested from cell supernatants corresponding to 20,000 cpm reverse transcriptase activity were incubated with ∼30,000 Cf2Th-CD4 cells transfected with varying amounts of plasmid expressing CCR5, CXCR4, the CCR5 variant ΔNR5, or the CXCR4 variant ΔNX4. Experiments that included the s22, s13, and c22 peptides were performed by incubating target cells with a mixture of viruses and peptide at the indicated concentrations in a total volume of 150 μl in 48-well plates. The cells were washed following overnight incubation and lysed 60 h later. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was then measured in cell lysates. Cf2Th-ΔNR5 or Cf2Th-CCR5 cells were plated onto a 384-well plate at 12,000 cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were loaded with the no-wash dye in loading buffer (Molecular Devices) for 1 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 40 μl, as recommended by the manufacturer. The measurements of calcium mobilization in response to MIP-1α or MIP-1β, in the presence or absence of the indicated peptides, were performed by injecting 10 μl of the chemokine/peptide mixture onto the loaded cells, using FLIPR (Molecular Devices). Metabolically labeled soluble gp120 molecules derived from the YU2 and ADA HIV-1 isolates were produced from HEK293T cells that were transfected with gp120 expressor plasmids and labeled with [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine. Radiolabeled cell supernatants were centrifuged to remove debris, and gp120 content was quantified by Western blotting with sera from HIV-1-infected individuals using purified gp120 as a standard. Supernatant containing ∼50 ng of labeled gp120 was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 500 ng of soluble CD4 and the indicated concentrations of s22, s13, or c22 peptides or buffer only in a total volume of 100 μl. Approximately 2 × 105 Cf2Th-CCR5, Cf2Th-ΔNR5, or Cf2Th cells were pelleted and resuspended in the gp120/CD4/peptide mixture containing 0.1% NaN3 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of 1%n-dodecyl-d-maltoside detergent (Anatrace) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Following centrifugation to remove debris, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of sera from HIV-1-infected individuals and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Approximately 2 × 105Cf2Th-CCR5 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.2 nm [125I]MIP-1α and 200 μm of the indicated peptide, buffer only, or with 300 nm of unlabeled MIP-1α. The cells were washed as described previously (24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar, 27Farzan M. Choe H. Martin K.A. Sun Y. Sidelko M. Mackay C.R. Gerard N.P. Sodroski J. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6854-6857Google Scholar), and bound 125I was measured by γ counting. We have previously demonstrated that specific tyrosines and acidic residues in the amino terminus of CCR5 are critical to the ability of the R5 isolates ADA and YU2 and the R5X4 isolate 89.6 to infect CCR5-expressing target cells (22Farzan M. Choe H. Vaca L. Martin K. Sun Y. Desjardins E. Ruffing N., Wu, L. Wyatt R. Gerard N. Gerard C. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1160-1164Google Scholar). We have also shown that sulfate moieties at tyrosines 10, 14, and 15 of CCR5 contribute to the efficiency of infection by the same isolates (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Google Scholar). To further assess the role of the CCR5 amino-terminal region that includes these tyrosines, a construct, denoted ΔNR5 (Fig.1 A), was generated that lacks residues 2–17 but retains the first cysteine of the CCR5, which is important for efficient receptor expression (28Blanpain C. Lee B. Vakili J. Doranz B.J. Govaerts C. Migeotte I. Sharron M. Dupriez V. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18902-18908Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that HIV-1 viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the R5 isolates YU2 and ADA could efficiently enter Cf2Th-CD4 cells transfected with varying amounts of plasmid encoding wild-type CCR5 (Fig. 2,A and B, circles). However, these same viruses were markedly less efficient in infecting Cf2Th-CD4 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding ΔNR5 (Fig. 2,A and B, squares). Both R5 viruses infected ΔNR5-expressing Cf2Th-CD4 cells at less than 2% the efficiency of cells expressing the equivalent levels of wild-type CCR5. Moreover, viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the R5X4 isolate 89.6 did not detectably infect Cf2Th-CD4 cells expressing ΔNR5, although they efficiently infected Cf2Th cells expressing wild-type CCR5 (data not shown). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2 (C and D), Cf2Th-CD4 cells transfected with plasmids encoding ΔNX4, a CXCR4 variant analogous to ΔNR5 (Fig. 1 A), could be efficiently infected by viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of the R5X4 isolate 89.6 or the X4 isolate HXBc2 (19 and 44%, respectively, of infection observed for cells expressing equivalent levels of wild-type CXCR4). These data underscore the major contribution of the CCR5 amino terminus to the ability of R5 and R5X4 isolates to enter target cells and highlight the less significant contribution of the amino terminus of CXCR4 to infection by X4 and R5X4 isolates. Tyrosine-sulfated peptides based on the CCR5 amino terminus specifically block HIV-1 infection of CCR5-expressing target cells at micromolar concentrations and inhibit the association of CCR5 with gp120/sCD4 complexes and with the chemokine MIP-1α (23Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C. Dragic T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5762-5767Google Scholar, 24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J.

In particular, a peptide (denoted here as s22; Fig. 1 B) corresponding to the first 22 residues of the CCR5 amino terminus, with sulfated moieties present at tyrosines 10 and 14, blocked the entry into peripheral blood mononuclear cells and macrophages of viruses pseudotyped with the ADA, YU2, and 89.6 envelope glycoproteins (24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar). A peptide (denoted as c22; Fig.1 B) with the identical 22 residues but lacking the two sulfate moieties had no effect on HIV-1 entry or CCR5 association with gp120 or MIP-1α. These same peptides, as well as a smaller peptide (denoted here as s13; Fig. 1 B) corresponding to residues in the immediate vicinity of tyrosines 10 and 14, were assayed for their effect on the ability of HIV-1 to enter cells expressing ΔNR5. Fig. 3 demonstrates that both s22 and s13 substantially enhanced the ability of the ADA and YU2 viruses to infect Cf2Th-CD4 cells expressing ΔNR5. Entry of the YU2 virus was nearly 30% of that observed for Cf2Th-CD4 cells expressing equivalent levels of wild-type CCR5 at the highest concentration of s22 used (137 μm). Entry of the ADA virus was similarly enhanced by s22, to about 25% of entry observed for wild-type CCR5-expressing cells (Fig. 3). The s13 peptide was less efficient than the s22 peptide at enhancing the entry of the YU2 virus but enhanced the entry of the ADA virus only slightly less efficiently than the s22 peptide. The c22 peptide had no effect on the ability of either the ADA or YU2 viruses to infect the same cells. None of the peptides were capable of enhancing the entry of HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of the R5X4 89.6 isolate (Fig. 3 C), a result consistent with the greater sensitivity of this isolate to amino-terminal perturbations of CCR5 (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Choe H. Cell. 1999; 96: 667-676Google Scholar, 22Farzan M. Choe H. Vaca L. Martin K. Sun Y. Desjardins E.

Chem. 2002; 28: 28Google Scholar). These peptides also had no effect on infection by viruses pseudotyped with the envelope glycoproteins of 89.6 or with the X4 isolate HXBc2 of Cf2th-CD4 cells expressing either wild-type CXCR4 or ΔNX4, a CXCR4 variant lacking residues 2–25 (Fig. 3 C). None of the peptides enhanced entry of the ADA, YU2, 89.6, or HXBc2 viruses into Cf2Th-CD4 cells lacking coreceptor molecules (data not shown). These data show that the amino terminus of CCR5 provided in trans can complement the inability of cells expressing ΔNR5 to support efficient HIV-1 infection by R5 isolates. Cf2Th cells expressing CCR5 mobilize calcium in response to its natural ligands MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES (31Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Google Scholar, 32Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Google Scholar). We assayed the ability of these cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding ΔNR5 or CCR5 (Cf2Th-ΔNR5 or Cf2Th-CCR5 cells, respectively) to mobilize calcium in response to MIP-1α and MIP-1β in the presence and absence of the s22, s13, and c22 peptides. Fig. 4 A demonstrates that Cf2Th-ΔNR5 cells did not detectably mobilize calcium in the presence of high concentrations (500 nm) of the chemokine MIP-1α. However, when 200 μm of the s22 peptide was introduced with the MIP-1α to Cf2Th-ΔNR5 cells, an efficient calcium flux could be detected (Fig. 4 A). This response was comparable with or higher than the response of Cf2Th-CCR5 cells when pulsed with 50 nm of MIP-1α. The s13 peptide allowed only a modest mobilization of calcium in Cf2Th-ΔNR5 cells pulsed with 500 nm MIP-1α. No detectable response was observed with 500 nm MIP-1α and 200 μm of the unsulfated c22 peptide (Fig. 4 A) or in the absence of chemokine (not shown). Qualitatively identical results were obtained using the chemokine MIP-1β in the same experiments (data not shown). Fig. 4 B demonstrates that the ability of the s22 peptide to enable MIP-1α to mobilize calcium in Cf2Th-ΔNR5 cells is dependent on the concentration of s22 used, with 50 μm of s22 enabling a substantially lower signal than with higher concentrations of s22. These results demonstrate that, at the concentrations indicated, sulfated CCR5-derived peptides can reconstitute the ability of ΔNR5 to respond to natural ligands of CCR5. The s13 peptide was consistently less efficient than the s22 peptide in the above assays, although it encompasses the region shown to be most critical to the coreceptor function of CCR5. To determine the relative ability of the s13 peptide to associate with gp120/CD4 complexes, this peptide was assayed for its ability to block the association of CCR5 with gp120/CD4. Fig. 5 A shows that the s13 was ∼10–20% less efficient than the s22 peptide in blocking the association of complexes of CD4 and the ADA or YU2 gp120 glycoproteins with Cf2Th-CCR5 cells. We previously demonstrated that the s22 at high concentrations can specifically interfere with the association of MIP-1α and CCR5 (24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar). We assayed the relative ability of s22 and s13 to block the ability of MIP-1α to bind Cf2Th-CCR5 cells. As shown in Fig.5 B, the s22 was more efficient than the s13 peptide in blocking the association of MIP-1α with CCR5. The relative difference between the two sulfated peptides appeared to be more pronounced in the blocking the association of CCR5 to MIP-1α than to gp120/CD4 complexes. It is also worth noting that no binding of gp120/CD4 complexes or MIP-1α to Cf2Th-ΔNR5 cells could be detected in the presence or absence of any of the peptides assayed here (data not shown). We conclude that the s22 peptide is slightly more efficient than the s13 peptide in interfering with the ligation of gp120/CD4 complexes and MIP-1α to CCR5. We have shown here that deletion of the critical tyrosine-sulfated region of CCR5 dramatically interferes with HIV-1 entry but that an analogous deletion of CXCR4 has a much less pronounced effect. These data are consistent with other observations suggesting a major role for the amino terminus of CCR5, but not that of CXCR4, in HIV-1 coreceptor function (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P.

We have also shown that two tyrosine-sulfated peptides (s22 and s13) based on the amino terminus of CCR5 can complement the inability of a CCR5 variant lacking residues 2–17 (ΔNR5) to support efficient HIV-1 infection or to mobilize calcium in response to chemokine. These data are the first that demonstrate the complementation of a defective G protein-coupled receptor variant with a soluble fragment of that receptor. We and others have previously demonstrated a physical association between the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120/CD4 complexes and s22 and similar peptides. For example, immunoprecipitation of gp120/CD4 complexes by the CD4 induced anti-gp120 antibodies 48d and 23e was blocked by s22 (24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar), and multimeric gp120/CD4 complexes could bind sulfated CCR5-derived peptide in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay (29Cormier E.G. Tran D.N. Yukhayeva L. Olson W.C. Dragic T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5541-5549Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows schematically a model of reconstitution that best reflects these observations and those in this study. In the presence of CD4 and a fully functional CCR5 molecule, the s22 peptide binds a portion of the CCR5-binding domain of HIV-1 gp120, sterically impeding association of gp120 with CCR5 (Fig. 6, top panels). The ΔNR5 molecule, lacking its critical amino terminus, cannot associate with the CD4-bound HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and cannot mediate entry (Fig. 6,bottom left panel). However, the s22 peptide bound to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein can transiently associate with ΔNR5 receptor to mediate entry (Fig. 6, bottom right panel). s22 cannot enhance the entry observed for CXCR4 and ΔNX4 because the envelope glycoproteins of X4 isolates cannot bind s22 (23Cormier E.G. Persuh M. Thompson D.A. Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Olson W.C. Dragic T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5762-5767Google Scholar, 24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar) and presumably because it cannot mediate association of these gp120 molecules with these CXCR4-based receptors. Although these peptides could complement the functional activities of ΔNR5, they could not complement the inability of ΔNR5 to detectably bind gp120/CD4 complexes or chemokine ligands. This apparent discrepancy can be readily resolved by proposing that the sulfated peptides have a rapid off-rate (24Farzan M. Vasilieva N. Schnitzler C.E. Chung S. Robinson J. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Choe H. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33516-33521Google Scholar). This off-rate would prevent detection of a physical association between ΔNR5 and the ligands of CCR5 in binding assays that require bound complexes to persist through one or more wash steps. In contrast, both HIV-1 infection and chemokine signaling require only a transient association among ΔNR5, sulfated peptides, and gp120 or chemokine, respectively, and these processes, once underway, are irreversible. In the entry assays described, the HIV-1 virion is held in position on the cell surface by CD4. A relatively short-lived association of the HIV-1 envelope with peptide appears to be sufficient to mediate association with ΔNR5 and induce fusion of the virion with the target cell. Similarly, chemokine-mediated signaling is also an event that requires only a short-lived association of chemokine with its receptor, including, as these data imply, the receptor amino terminus. This model contrasts with previous suggestions that the amino terminus of chemokine receptors is a relatively disordered domain that functions primarily to position chemokine proximal to the relatively more important extracellular loops of the molecule (38Siciliano S.J. Rollins T.E. DeMartino J. Konteatis Z. Malkowitz L. Van Riper G. Bondy S. Rosen H. Springer M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1214-1218Google Scholar, 39Schwyzer R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18077-18082Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the CCR5 amino terminus has important contacts with the remainder of the receptor and may constitute a large portion of the ligand-accessible surface of the receptor. Functional reconstitution of G protein-coupled receptors may be useful in further studies of these receptors and their ligands. Peptide variants of the ones used here can be used to distinguish between amino-terminal residues that interact with ligand and those that interact with the receptor body. Sulfated peptides also may be useful in the bulk synchronization of the HIV-1 fusion process, allowing the coordinated exposure of fusion intermediate forms of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (7Eckert D.M. Kim P.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 777-810Google Scholar). Study of these fusion intermediates could cast light on the mechanism and kinetics of HIV-1 fusion. Finally, these data provide the most compelling evidence to date of the functional involvement of the sulfated moieties of the CCR5 amino terminus in both chemokine association and HIV-1 entry. Given the functional roles of amino-terminal tyrosine sulfates in CCR5, CCR2b, CXCR4, C3XCR1, and the C5a receptor (21Farzan M. Mirzabekov T. Kolchinsky P. Wyatt R. Cayabyab M. Gerard N.P. Gerard C.

https://openalex.org/W2025134487,"By combining real time measurements of agonist binding, by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and of subsequent responses, we proposed previously that the neurokinin NK2 receptor preexists in equilibrium between three states: inactive, calcium-triggering, and cAMP-producing. Thr24 and Phe26 of the NK2 receptor extracellular domain are considered to interact with neuropeptide agonists based on the reduction of affinity when they are substituted by alanine. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we now quantify the binding kinetics of two Texas Red-modified neurokinin A agonists to the fluorescent wild-type (Y-NK2wt) and the mutant (Y-NK2mut)receptor carrying Thr24 → Ala and Phe26 → Ala mutations. TR1-neurokinin A binds with a fast component and a slow component to the Y-NK2wt receptor and triggers both a calcium and a cAMP response. In contrast, on the mutant receptor, it binds in a single fast step with a lower apparent affinity and activates only the calcium response. Another agonist, TRC4-neurokinin A, binds to both wild-type and mutant receptors in a single fast step, with similar affinities and kinetics and promotes only calcium signaling. Kinetic modeling of ligand binding and receptor interconversions is carried out to analyze phenotypic changes in terms of binding alterations or changes in the transitions between conformational states. We show that the binding and response properties of the Y-NK2mutreceptor are best described according to a phenotype where a reduction of the transition between the inactive and the active states occurs.

We show that the binding and response properties of the Y-NK2mutreceptor are best described according to a phenotype where a reduction of the transition between the inactive and the active states occurs. G-protein-coupled receptor fluorescence resonance energy transfer neurokinin A Texas Red enhanced green fluorescent protein Substance P phosphate-buffered saline standard deviation G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 represent the largest family of cell surface receptors and have multiple effects on the activated cell. Despite the variety of molecular types of ligands (hormones, proteins, small peptides, ions, lipids, and sensory stimuli such as odorants, pheromones, and photons), GPCRs share homology in their core domain composed of seven transmembrane α-helices. The conservation of the same overall hydrophobic structure exemplifies the essential role of this structure for the activation process. GPCR activation promotes GDP to GTP exchange on the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein associated with its cytoplasmic loops, thereby initializing the intracellular cascade of signaling events. Among the theoretical models describing the activation mechanism, the two-state allosteric model of activation has been proposed, following the discovery of inverse agonists and of constitutive activity for GPCRs (1Karlin A. J. Theor. Biol. 1967; 16: 306-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Morgan P.H. Lutz M.W. Kenakin T.P. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 181: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this model, a GPCR preexists in equilibrium between an active and an inactive state in the absence of ligand. As such, agonists, higher affinity for the active state having displace the equilibrium toward activation, whereas inverse agonists have higher affinities for the inactive state. Constitutive activity is explained by an intrinsic tendency for a receptor to spontaneously isomerize toward the active conformation. Although the multiple conformational states theory is an attractive model for describing GPCR activation, there is a need for more data correlating the parameters of possible intermediate conversion states with physiological responses. Indeed, several GPCRs have been reported to mediate multiple signaling pathways through activation of different heterotrimeric G proteins: the receptors for dopamine D1 (Gs and Go (5Kimura K. Sela S.

These different couplings suggest that GPCRs may exist in more than a single active state. We have previously addressed the question of multiple receptor states by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to monitor ligand binding in parallel with cellular responses. A chimeric green fluorescent neurokinin NK2 receptor, EGFP-NK2R was expressed in HEK293 cells. Two of its neuropeptide agonists, the decapeptide neurokinin A (NKA) and its truncated form, NKA-(4–10), were covalently linked to the fluorophore Texas Red (TR) (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Kinetic measurements of the associations of TR1-NKA and TR7-NKA-(4–10) to the EGFP-NK2 receptor on living cells were monitored as a diminution of fluorescence emission of EGFP due to FRET. This analysis showed that the NK2 receptor exists in a minimal number of three receptor conformations, denoted R0, R1, and R2 with intrinsic binding constants specific to each ligand (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The R0 state corresponded to the inactive state. The R1 state could be populated by the two agonists, was characterized by a rapid association with both ligands, and corresponded to an active conformation triggering calcium responses via heterotrimeric Gq activation. The R2 state was stabilized at equilibrium only by TR1-NKA and was characterized by a slow binding relaxation temporally correlated with a cyclic AMP response unique to TR1-NKA. The R2 state was thus assigned to an active conformation triggering cAMP synthesis putatively through Gs activation (20Nakajima Y. Tsuchida K. Negishi M. Ito S. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2437-2442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Catalioto R.M. Cucchi P. Renzetti A.R. Criscuoli M. Maggi C.A. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.

In the present study, the phenotype of an EYFP chimeric fluorescent NK2 receptor carrying two point mutations located in the extracellular amino-terminal domain Thr24 → Ala and Phe26→ Ala has been investigated. These substitutions taken independently have been previously shown to lower the apparent affinity of NKA for the receptor (23Huang R.R. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Labrou N.E. Bhogal N. Hurrell C.R. Findlay J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37944-37949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Thr24 and Phe26 are part of the binding domain for NKA. In addition, the activation process was reported to be unaffected by the substitutions, as measured by the ability of NKA to trigger calcium responses (23Huang R.R. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, given the demonstration that the NK2 receptor exists in several active states (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we have now reanalyzed intracellular responses of the mutant receptor that we named Y-NK2mut. We find that the Y-NK2mut receptor is unable to activate cAMP production irrespective of the agonist tested. This shows that Thr24 and Phe26 somehow play a role in the activation process. We have studied the kinetics of interaction between the Y-NK2mut receptor and two of its fluorescent agonists (TR1-NKA and TRC4-NKA) by FRET and compared them to those of the wild-type Y-NK2wt receptor. The experimental data are interpreted in the context of the kinetic model previously used to describe the activation of the EGFP-NK2 receptor. We propose that, in fact, the mutant receptor is affected in its capacity to interconvert between the inactive state R0 and the two active states, behaving like a “constitutively inactive” receptor. Synthetic peptides were obtained from Bachem or Neosystem. Protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. Fluorescent labels and ion chelators were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). SR48968 was a kind gift from Sanofi. [3H]SR48968 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Geneticin (G418) was from Invitrogen. A NotI-XhoI SP-EYFP fragment, in which SP is the signal peptide and EYFP the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, was generated as described for the SP-EGFP fragment (25Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using pEYFP-C3 (Clontech) as a source of EYFP sequence. The wild-type rat NK2 sequence starting at the amino acid 16 was extracted from the pCEP4-chim1 vector as a XhoI-BamHI fragment (25Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The NK2 mutant fragment XhoI-BamHI was amplified by PCR using pCEP4chim1 as a bait with primer 1 (A CCGCTC GAG AGC AAT GCC ACG GGT GTT GCA GCCGCC TCC ATG) (XhoI site underlined) and primer 2 (CG GGA TCC CTA AGC CTG GGC CTT GCA GAT GGG) (BamHI site underlined). The mutated nucleotides are in boldface type in primer 1. The NotI-XhoI SP-EYFP fragment was ligated in frame to theXhoI-BamHI NK2 fragment and inserted in the expression vector pREP9 (Invitrogen) between the NotI andBamHI sites. HEK 293 cells, grown in minimal essential medium complemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (streptomycin/penicillin), were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) and selected with 600 μg/ml G418. Stable cell lines were passaged twice a week. New stocks were defrosted every 12 weeks. Cells were grown for 2 days in 24-well plates on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with rat type I collagen. For endosome staining, Texas Red transferrin uptake was done as previously described (27Gicquiaux H. Lecat S. Gaire M. Dieterlen A. Mely Y. Takeda K. Bucher B. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6645-6655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or cell lines expressing either the Y-NK2wt or the Y-NK2mutreceptor were transiently transfected with a pcDNA3 plasmid expressing a Rab5(Q79L)-myc tagged under a cytomegalovirus promoter. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 15 min at room temperature and then incubated for 15 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. Coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using Möwiol (Calbiochem) and observed either with an inverted microscope (Zeiss Axioplan) equipped with a Hamamatsu CDD camera or with an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) connected to a laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES) using a Plan Apo ×60 1.20 numerical aperture water immersion objective (Nikon). For epifluorescence measurements, the EYFP was excited at 485 ± 10 nm with a bandpass filter. Emitted fluorescence was detected using a dichroic mirror at 510 nm and a longpass filter of 520 nm. For confocal measurements, excitation was from a 30-milliwatt krypton/argon laser at 10% power. Each stack of two-dimensional images was acquired sequentially in the green channel (PMT2; excitation 488 nm, emission 522 nm) and eventually in the red channel (PMT1; excitation 568 nm, emission 605 nm), before stepping (0.5 μm) the objective in thez axis; typically 10–12 images are taken per cell. Around 5 million cells were resuspended in 800 μl of cold lysis buffer (in 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm/EDTA, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mmdithiothreitol and one tablet of complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (for 10 ml of buffer; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A postnuclear supernatant was prepared as described previously (27Gicquiaux H. Lecat S. Gaire M. Dieterlen A. Mely Y. Takeda K. Bucher B. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6645-6655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were carried out with a polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody made in our laboratory. The immunoprecipitated complex was prepared as described (27Gicquiaux H. Lecat S. Gaire M. Dieterlen A. Mely Y. Takeda K. Bucher B. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6645-6655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) prior to loading on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blots were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Clontech) at a 1:1000 dilution, followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:2000 dilution. Detection was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal® WestPico; PerbioScience). Radioligand binding assays and quantification of receptor sites per cell were performed as described previously (25Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Competition experiments were performed at 4 °C with 1 nm[3H]SR48968 for 3 h, and experimental IC50 values were converted to K i values using the Cheng and Prusoff relationship (28Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12264) Google Scholar). The peptides NKA (HKTDSFVGLM-NH2), C7-NKA-(4–10) (DSFCGLM-NH2) and C4-NKA (HKTCSFVGLM-NH2) were derivatized with Texas Red as previously described for fluorescent TR1-NKA and TR7-NKA-(4–10) peptides (19Palanche T.

Hibert, and J. L. Galzi, manuscript in preparation. Adherent cells were rinsed with PBS and dissociated from the culture flask in PBS, 5 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4. Unless otherwise stated, cell suspensions were at 106 cells/ml in HEPES-bovine serum albumin buffer (137.5 mm NaCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 6 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.4) supplemented with protease inhibitors (40 μg/ml bestatin and bacitracin, 20 μg/ml phosphoramidon, 50 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). All fluorescence measurements on cell suspensions were made on a Fluorolog-2 (SPEX) spectrofluorometer equipped with a 450-watt xenon lamp, one double grating excitation (set at 470 nm) and two single grating emission monochromators (time-based set at 530 and 610 nm). Interaction of TR-modified NKA with the cell surface Y-NK2 receptors was monitored as a decrease of EYFP emission at 530 nm due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer toward the acceptor group TR. Data were acquired with a photon-counting photomultiplier (linear up to 107 counts/s) and stored using the DM3000 software provided with the spectrofluorometer. Cells were placed in a 1-ml cuvette with magnetic stirring and maintained at 21 °C in the thermostatted cuvette handler of the spectrofluorometer as previously described (25Vollmer J.Y. Alix P. Chollet A. Takeda K. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37915-37922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Time-based recordings were sampled every 300 ms. Ligand was added to the cuvette at around 20–50 s by stopping the recordings for a short time. Quantitative experiments were carried out at 21 °C with an Applied Photophysics SK1E apparatus modified for rapid mixing of living cells. The observation chamber was a Hellma 176.002 (100-μl) quartz circulation cuvette placed in the cuvette holder of the spectrofluorometer. Time-based recordings were sampled every 50 ms as described (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The range of ligand concentration used in stopped-flow assays was previously determined in equilibrium binding assays, yielding measurement of receptor site occupancy and saturation. Each trace corresponds to the mean of three consecutive recordings. Fitting was carried out with nonlinear regression, by giving to each triplicate a weighting inversely proportional to the corresponding variance. Traces were analyzed with a single exponential, one exponential plus linear, drift or two exponentials plus linear drift with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Heidmann T. Changeux J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 97: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The selection of the adequate fitting procedure was based on the comparison of the nonlinear least squares derived for the various fits. The single bimolecular interaction data were analyzed with Kaleidagraph, whereas the data corresponding to the model of a bimolecular interaction followed by the interconversion to a second conformation were analyzed with SAS software. The FRET measurements in the stopped-flow system were performed with 2 × 106 cells/ml. Each cell line expressed 750,000 Y-NK2wt receptor sites and 1 million Y-NK2mut receptor sites per cell. Final receptor site concentration in the assay was thus as follows: [Y-NK2wtT] ∼ (750,000 × 2 × 106 × 103)/6.02 × 1023∼ 2.5 nm, and [Y-NK2mut T] ∼ (1,000,000 × 2 × 106 × 103)/6.02 × 1023 ∼ 3 nm. In the stopped-flow measurements, an exponential drift occurs with a constant rate of 0.025 s−1 at all agonist concentrations, and its amplitude is constant. This is due to the sedimentation of the cells in the cuvette, since it is not observed in recordings performed in a standard cuvette equipped with magnetic stirring. This exponential drift has been taken into account in the kinetic data analysis (and has been afterwards subtracted from the binding traces for fitting of the experimental traces with the simulated traces in the modeling). Dissociation curves were analyzed with Kaleidagraph with either one or two exponentials according to the following: [RL](t) = a +be−koff bt or [RL](t) = a +be−koff bt +ce−koff ct. Each relaxation process was characterized by the values of its amplitude (b andc, given as relative amplitudes) and of its dissociation rate constant k off. Adherent cells were loaded with 5 μm Indo-1 in HEPES-bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 37 °C. They were dissociated in PBS and suspended in HEPES-bovine serum albumin buffer. Cell suspension measurements were made at 21 or 37 °C in the 1-ml cuvette on the spectrofluorometer with excitation set at 355 nm and emission detected at 400 nm. cAMP measurements were performed as described by Rumenapp et al. (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Agonists were applied on adherent cells at 21 or 37 °C and at various concentrations for 15 min, unless otherwise stated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 volume of ice-cold 0.2 m HCl. Kinetic modeling of ligand binding, and responses was performed as described by Palanche et al. (19Palanche T. Ilien B. Zoffmann S. Reck M.P. Bucher B. Edelstein S.J. Galzi J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34853-34861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The differential equations for ligand binding are solved in the MATLAB computing environment using a program called STOIC (30Edelstein S.J. Schaad O. Henry E. Bertrand D. Changeux J.P. Biol. Cybern. 1996; 75: 361-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The theoretical model simulates ligand binding for a receptor with one binding site and three conformational states. The conformational states are in freely interconverting equilibria, such that all states are present in defined proportions in the absence of ligand and their equilibria shift as a function of the kinetics of ligand binding. The entered parameters for each receptor and for each ligand in the simulation are as follows: (i) experimental ligand concentrations, (ii) measured association rate constant k 1 (assuming that they are identical for the three states), (iii) measured dissociation rate constant k off for each state (all of the experimental dissociation traces have been fitted with two exponentials and correspond to two of the three states, each combination being tested in the modeling), and (iv) intrinsic rates for the transition between two ligand-bound receptor states. The program simulates and represents as a function of time (i) the theoretical binding and dissociation traces for the indicated concentrations of ligand and (ii) the theoretical proportions of ligand-free and ligand-bound receptor states and allows us to derive values for the intrinsic isomerization constants Γ between two of the NK2 receptor states. Huang et al. (23Huang R.R. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) have performed an exhaustive site-directed mutagenesis study of the NK2 receptor to identify residues involved in NKA binding. Important residues were mainly located in the amino-terminal domain, the extracellular loops 1 and 2, and in the second hydrophobic transmembrane helix. We have introduced two point mutations in the extracellular extremity of rat NK2 (substitutions Thr24 → Ala and Phe26 → Ala). Y-NK2wt and Y-NK2mut chimeric receptors were generated by joining the carboxyl terminus of the yellow fluorescent protein EYFP to the amino-terminal part starting at residue Leu16 of the wild-type and the mutant NK2 (Fig.1 A), as had previously been done for the wild-type NK2 receptor fused to the green fluorescent protein, EGFP (19Palanche T.

Confocal images of the expressing cells illustrate that the fusion proteins were properly localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B). Intracellular fluorescent signal corresponds mainly to endosomal compartments as measured by Rab5 and Texas Red-transferrin co-localization (data not shown). Each protein had the expected size on polyacrylamide gels (27 kDa of EYFP plus 40 kDa of NK2 receptor) as revealed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1 C). The number of receptors expressed at the cell surface were estimated from radiolabeled antagonist [3H]SR48968 binding, which is not sensitive to mutations in the amino-terminal domain (23Huang R.R. Vicario P.P. Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10048-10055Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For each cell line, we have found ∼750,000 Y-NK2wt sites and 1,150,000 Y-NK2mut sites per cell. NKA binding affinities were determined from competition experiments performed at equilibrium using 1 nm[3H]SR48968 (Fig.2 A). The apparent inhibition constants for NKA (K i ± S.D., n = 3) were 4.5 ± 0.5 nm and 45 ± 8 μm for Y-NK2wt and Y-NK2mut receptors, respectively, indicating an apparent 10,000-fold loss of NKA affinity for the mutant, which is in agreement with published data (23Huang R.R.

Calcium responses were monitored on cell suspensions using Indo-1 fluorescence variations after agonist addition and quantified as peak response amplitudes. The Y-NK2mutreceptor responded to NKA with an EC50 of 3.4 ± 0.2 μm (versus 2.2 ± 0.5 nm for the Y-NK2wt receptor) and a maximal response reaching 70% of the maximal Y-NK2wt receptor response for the same agonist (Fig.2 B).

Unexpectedly, the mutant did not induce any cAMP response even at high concentrations of NKA (up to 100 μm) (Fig.2 C). Previously, we have modeled the activation of the NK2 receptor and proposed that its calcium and cAMP responses are mediated by distinct active states R1 and R2, respectively (Fig.3), which can be detected by ligand binding kinetic determinations (19Palanche T.

Previously, we demonstrated that PKCepsilon has the capacity to enhance the expression of both caveolin-1 and c-Myc in cultured prostate cancer cells and is sufficient to induce the growth of androgen-independent tumors. In this study, we have uncovered further evidence of a functional interplay among these proteins in the CWR22 model of human prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that PKCepsilon expression was naturally up-regulated in recurrent CWR22 tumors and that this oncoprotein was required to sustain the androgen-independent proliferation of CWR-R1 cells in culture. Gene transfer experiments demonstrated that PKCepsilon had the potential to augment the expression and secretion of a biologically active caveolin-1 protein that supports the growth of the CWR-R1 cell line. Antisense and pharmacological experiments provided additional evidence that the sequential activation of PKCepsilon, mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Myc, and androgen receptor signaling drove the downstream expression of caveolin-1 in CWR-R1 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that mitogen-activated protein kinases were required downstream of PKCepsilon to derepress the transcriptional elongation of the c-myc gene. Our findings support the hypothesis that PKCepsilon may advance the recurrence of human prostate cancer by promoting the expression of several important downstream effectors of disease progression."

During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, a prereplication complex (pre-RC) consisting of ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM2–7 is established at replication origins on the chromatin. At the G1/S transition, MCM10 and the protein kinases Cdc7-Dbf4 and Cdk2-cyclin E cooperate to recruit Cdc45 to the pre-RC, followed by origin unwinding, RPA binding, and recruitment of DNA polymerases. Using the soluble DNA replication system derived fromXenopus eggs, we demonstrate that immunodepletion of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) from egg extracts and inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid abolish loading of Cdc45 to the pre-RC. Consistent with a defect in Cdc45 loading, origin unwinding and the loading of RPA and DNA polymerase α are also inhibited. Inhibition of PP2A has no effect on MCM10 loading and on Cdc7-Dbf4 or Cdk2 activity. The substrate of PP2A is neither a component of the pre-RC nor Cdc45. Instead, our data suggest that PP2A functions by dephosphorylating and activating a soluble factor that is required to recruit Cdc45 to the pre-RC. Furthermore, PP2A appears to counteract an unknown inhibitory kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the same factor. Thus, the initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication is regulated at the level of Cdc45 loading by a combination of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation events.

Together, these proteins form the prereplication complex (pre-RC), which is generated during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. At the G1/S transition, the pre-RC is activated by cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 (17Jackson P.K. Chevalier S. Philippe M. Kirschner M.W. J.

Although both kinases are required for the same step, they function in a defined order. In the Xenopus cell-free replication system, Cdc7-Dbf4 functions before and independently of Cdk2-cyclin E (28Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Google Scholar, 29Jares P. Blow J.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1528-1540Google Scholar), whereas in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc7-Dbf4 acts downstream of Cdk2 (32Nougarede R. Della Seta F. Zarzov P. Schwob E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3795-3806Google Scholar). In addition to Cdc7-Dbf4 and Cdk2, MCM10 is required for Cdc45 loading. MCM10 binding to the pre-RC is MCM2–7-dependent but does not require the presence of Cdc7 or Cdk2 (33Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Google Scholar). Subsequent to Cdc45 loading, the DNA is unwound at the replication origin, and the unwound strands are stabilized by the single-stranded DNA binding protein, RPA (34Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5182-5191Google Scholar, 35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar). After the origin is unwound, the initiation complex is completed by the loading of DNA polymerase α (31Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Google Scholar, 35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar, 36Aparicio O.M. Stout A.M. Bell S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9130-9135Google Scholar). Xenopus egg extracts are valuable tools to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of replication initiation. Upon the addition of sperm chromatin to the extract, replication-competent nuclei are assembled, and semiconservative DNA replication occurs (37Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Google Scholar, 38Newport J. Cell. 1987; 48: 205-217Google Scholar). Recently, a nucleus-free replication system has been developed withXenopus eggs (39Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Google Scholar). This variation of the traditional system employs the use of two different extracts. First, pre-RCs are formed on either sperm chromatin or plasmid DNA in membrane-free egg cytosol (EC), which mimics the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Following pre-RC assembly, a concentrated nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) is added that recapitulates the environment found during S phase. Here, high levels of kinase activities (28Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Google Scholar) and initiation factors promote a complete round of semiconservative DNA replication. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) exists in most mammalian cells as two major forms, holoenzyme and core enzyme (40Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Google Scholar, 41Chung H. Nairn A.C. Murata K. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Google Scholar). The core enzyme consists of a 36-kDa catalytic C subunit and a 65-kDa regulatory A subunit. Holoenzymes are composed of core enzyme to which one of several regulatory B subunits is bound. The A and C subunits exist as two isoforms, isoforms Aα and Aβ and isoforms Cα and Cβ, respectively. The B subunits fall into four families, designated B, B′ (also called B56), B“, and B‴. Each family has several members. All subunits together could give rise to over 70 different forms of PP2A, indicating that PP2A is highly regulated and involved in many cellular processes (42Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Google Scholar). In Xenopus extracts, PP2A represents 1% of total protein, whereby core and holoenzyme are present at a ratio of 1:1 (43Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar). We have previously shown that in Xenopus egg extracts, PP2A is required during initiation of DNA replication after the formation of pre-RCs and before elongation (43Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that PP2A regulates the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin. It plays no role in RPA loading or any step thereafter. Xenopus laevis egg cytosol and nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) were prepared as described previously (39Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Google Scholar). DNA unwinding assays were performed according to Walter and Newport (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar). DNA replication was assayed by incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP (39Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Google Scholar). The percentage replication was estimated from the amount of [α-32P]dCMP incorporated and the specific activity of [α-32P]dCTP, assuming a 50 μm endogenous pool of dNTPs. However, since the amount of endogenous dNTPs was estimated and not individually determined for each extract, the calculated replication efficiency is in reality only a rough estimate of the actual efficiency. For PP2A rescue experiments, purified catalytic C subunit was used at a final concentration of 2.7 μm (43Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar). An equal amount of C subunit storage buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50% glycerol) was added to the controls. The PP2A C subunit (a generous gift from Dr. Marc Mumby, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) was purified from bovine heart. Some variation in the degree of rescue by added C subunit may be a result of differences in the amount of okadaic acid or the batch of extract used. Purified PP1 catalytic subunit (5000 units/mg; New England Biolabs) was used at a concentration equal to that of purified PP2A C subunit in rescue experiments. Recombinant His-tagged Cdc45 proteins were purified according to Mimura and Takisawa (31Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Google Scholar) and used at ∼0.3 mg/ml. Okadaic acid (Alexis Biochemicals) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 1.0–1.5 μm final concentration, depending on the batch of okadaic acid andXenopus egg extract. The NPE was typically preincubated with okadaic acid for 20 min before use. To isolate sperm chromatin, up to 6 μl of extract containing chromatin was diluted with 4 volumes of cold egg lysis buffer (250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.7) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and layered over a 170-μl egg lysis buffer cushion containing 500 mm sucrose in a 5 × 44-mm microcentrifuge tube (Beckman). The sample was centrifuged in a Beckman E microcentrifuge using a horizontal rotor at 16,000 ×g for 18 s at 4 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was gently washed with 200 μl of egg lysis buffer and respun in the same tube for 20 s as described above. The wash was carefully removed, and the pellet was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western analysis. PP2A was removed by three consecutive rounds of immunodepletion using monoclonal antibody 6F9 directed against the N terminus of the human Aα subunit as previously described (43Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar). The degree of depletion was determined for each experiment by Western blotting as described (43Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar). For egg cytosol, it was 99%; for NPE it was 95%. Immunodepletions of Cdc7, Cdc45, and RPA were carried out as described by Walter and Newport (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar). To avoid the typical loss of extract associated with depletions, a slit was introduced to the bottom of the Eppendorf tube to recover the extract by centrifugation into a fresh tube while retaining the beads. Western blotting was performed using antisera against xOrc2 (44Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Google Scholar), xMCM3 (45Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Google Scholar), xMCM10 (33Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Google Scholar), xCdc7 (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar), xCdc45 (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar), the 34-kDa subunit of xRPA (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar), and the 70-kDa subunit of DNA polymerase α (a generous gift from Dr. Teresa S. Wang; Stanford University). The pGex-KG vector containing mouse glutathione S-transferase-tagged p27Kip cDNA provided by Dr. Tony Hunter (46Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Google Scholar) was transformed into BL21(DE3)plysS bacteria, and p27Kipwas purified using the Amersham Bioscience bulk glutathioneS-transferase purification modules. Cdc7 or Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from 4 μl of NPE containing either okadaic acid or a control buffer and washed with kinase buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmβ-glycerolphosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmHepes, pH 7.7). Immunoprecipitated Cdc7 was subsequently incubated with 25 μg of MCM2 (a generous gift from Dr. Haruhiko Takisawa, Osaka University, Japan) in 10 μl of kinase buffer containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (47Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29042-29052Google Scholar). Similarly, immunoprecipitated Cdk2 was incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 4 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out for 30 min at room temperature, stopped with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and quantified with a PhosphorImager. The rabbit antisera against Cdk2 were made against the C-terminal 14 amino acids of Xenopus laevis Cdk2 and affinity-purified. It precipitates Cdk2 but not Cdc2. 2J. Walter and T. Prokhorova, unpublished results. Histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was labeled by an overnight incubation with [γ-33P]ATP and Cdc2 (New England Biolabs) in the supplied Cdc2 buffer (New England Biolabs). The resulting labeled histone H1 was dialyzed to remove unincorporated [γ-33P]ATP. Labeled histone H1 was then incubated in 50 μl of PP2A reaction buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 0.75 μm p27Kip, 0.01% Brij 35, and 0.3 μl of NPE containing either okadaic acid or a control buffer. After 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped with 200 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid, placed on ice for 10 min, and spun at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then collected and counted with a scintillation counter to determine the amount of phosphates released. Our previous finding that PP2A is required during the initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts (43Lin X.H. Walter J. Scheidtmann K. Ohst K. Newport J. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14693-14698Google Scholar) prompted us to ask whether PP2A directs the binding of initiation factors to chromatin. Although previous results indicated that PP2A is not needed for pre-RC formation, it may be required for the binding of MCM10, Cdc7, Cdc45, RPA, or DNA polymerase α to chromatin. To investigate this possibility, we carried out chromatin binding experiments in PP2A-depleted extracts (Fig.1 A). Sperm chromatin was incubated in PP2A- or mock-depleted EC for 30 min to form pre-RCs, followed by an additional 30-min incubation in PP2A- or mock-depleted NPE to allow formation of initiation complexes. Aphidicolin was added to NPE to inhibit elongation and preserve the initiation complex. The chromatin was then isolated from the extract by spinning through a sucrose cushion, and the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. As we reported previously, the absence of PP2A had no effect on the binding of MCM3, demonstrating that pre-RC formation was normal. We also examined Cdc7, whose binding has been reported to increase strongly upon the addition of NPE (28Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Google Scholar), and found that PP2A depletion had little effect on Cdc7 loading (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, binding of Cdc45 and RPA34 to chromatin was strongly reduced in the PP2A-depleted extracts (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 2 and 3). Binding was restored by the addition of purified PP2A catalytic C subunit to the depleted extracts (lane 4). As a control, a mixture of egg cytosol and NPE lacking chromatin was subjected to the same procedure (lane 1). In addition, PP2A- and mock-depleted extracts were tested in a replication assay. As shown in Fig.1 B, DNA replication was inhibited by PP2A removal, and this inhibition was efficiently rescued by the addition of purified PP2A catalytic C subunit to the depleted extracts. It is possible that mock-depleted extracts replicate less efficiently than PP2A-depleted extracts supplemented with C subunit due to dilution of endogenous PP2A during the depletion procedure. As an alternative to the removal of PP2A by immunodepletion, we studied chromatin binding of initiation factors in extracts supplemented with okadaic acid. Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of PP2A and, to a lesser extent, of PP1 (48Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Google Scholar, 49Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Google Scholar). Unlike immunodepletion, okadaic acid allows us to inactivate PP2A without subjecting extracts to dilution and mechanical stress, which can weaken their replication capacity. The use of okadaic acid also allowed us to determine whether it is the phosphatase activity of PP2A that is essential for replication initiation. To study the effect of PP2A activity on chromatin binding of initiation factors, sperm chromatin was incubated for 30 min in egg cytosol, followed by NPE supplemented with aphidicolin and either okadaic acid or a control buffer. The NPE was preincubated with okadaic acid and aphidicolin for 20 min before it was added to EC and sperm chromatin (see below). After a 30-min incubation in NPE, sperm chromatin was isolated from the extract for analysis. Consistent with the results of PP2A depletion, we found that inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid blocked the binding of Cdc45, RPA34, and DNA polymerase α to chromatin in NPE (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 4 and 5). The reduced binding was reversed by the addition of purified PP2A catalytic C subunit to the okadaic acid-containing NPE (lane 6). As with PP2A depletion, the amounts of ORC2, MCM3, and Cdc7 bound to chromatin were unaffected by okadaic acid (lanes 4–6). The background in the absence of chromatin from either egg cytosol alone or egg cytosol mixed with NPE is shown in lanes 1and 3, respectively. The diffuse band around the position of Cdc45 (lanes 3 and 5) is most likely background, because soluble and chromatin-bound Cdc45 always appear as sharp bands. Lane 2 shows the binding of proteins to chromatin after a 30-min incubation in egg cytosol and before the addition of NPE. The same extracts used for chromatin binding were also used in a DNA replication assay. Okadaic acid-treated extracts were deficient in replication, and the inhibition could be rescued by purified PP2A C subunit (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 C, the 20-min preincubation of okadaic acid and NPE is essential for achieving inhibition of Cdc45 loading and of DNA replication. Whereas complete inhibition of PP2A activity occurs within 2 min after the addition of okadaic acid to NPE, as determined by dephosphorylation of histone H1, complete inhibition of DNA replication took 20 min. These results suggest that when PP2A is inhibited, an essential replication factor becomes phosphorylated and inactivated by an unknown inhibitory protein kinase that is normally counteracted by PP2A. The substrate of PP2A and the presumed inhibitory kinase could be Cdc45 or another factor that controls Cdc45 loading. It is likely that during the removal of PP2A from NPE with antibodies, which takes 3–5 h, the same inhibitory phosphorylation event occurs as after the addition of okadaic acid to NPE. To demonstrate that the effect of okadaic acid was due specifically to the inhibition of PP2A and not PP1, sperm chromatin was incubated in extracts supplemented with okadaic acid and either PP2A or PP1. As shown in Fig. 2 D, PP2A (column 3) but not PP1 (column 4) rescued inhibition of DNA replication by okadaic acid. In fact, we repeatedly found that PP1 had an inhibitory effect on replication. In summary, we found that both the removal of PP2A by immunodepletion and the inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid block the loading of Cdc45 onto chromatin and prevent replication initiation. The lack of Cdc45 and RPA34 binding in both PP2A-depleted and okadaic acid-treated extracts suggested that PP2A counteracts a kinase that is capable of inhibiting origin unwinding. To examine this question more directly, we studied the effect of okadaic acid on the topology of circular plasmids undergoing replication initiation in Xenopus egg extracts. It was previously shown that origin unwinding results in a highly supercoiled species of plasmid DNA termed U-form DNA (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar). The generation of U-form DNA requires MCM2–7, Cdc7, Cdk2, MCM10, Cdc45, and RPA (33Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Google Scholar, 35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar). The normally transient U-form DNA can be trapped in the presence of aphidicolin and visualized on an agarose gel containing chloroquine. In the experiment shown in Fig.3, pBluescript was incubated first in egg cytosol for 30 min, followed by 5-, 10-, or 15-min incubations in NPE containing aphidicolin and either okadaic acid or a control buffer. Inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid strongly reduced the amount of U-form DNA generated (Fig. 3, lanes 5–7) compared with the control (lanes 2–4). This reduction was rescued by the addition of purified PP2A C subunit (lanes 8–10). Lane 1 shows the ground state of the plasmid in egg cytosol before the addition of NPE. The modest increase in supercoiling seen in the reactions containing OA (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and5–7) is almost certainly initiation-independent, since we previously showed that a similar amount of partial supercoiling is seen upon the addition of NPE in extracts lacking ORC, Cdk2, or MCM2–7 activity (35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that PP2A is required for origin unwinding, consistent with the failure to load Cdc45 in the absence of PP2A activity (Figs. 1 and 2). It is important to point out that complete inhibition of unwinding requires preincubation of NPE and okadaic acid, again implying that phosphorylation by an inhibitory protein kinase counteracts PP2A (data not shown). It has been shown that both Cdc7 and Cdk2 kinase activities are required for Cdc45 binding to the pre-RC (27Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Google Scholar, 28Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Google Scholar, 29Jares P. Blow J.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1528-1540Google Scholar, 35Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Google Scholar), and Cdc45 is a substrate of Cdc7-Dbf4 in vitro (32Nougarede R. Della Seta F. Zarzov P. Schwob E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3795-3806Google Scholar, 50Weinreich M. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5334-5346Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether PP2A promotes Cdc45 binding to chromatin by modulating either Cdc7 or Cdk2 kinase activity. To assay Cdc7 kinase activity, Cdc7 was immunoprecipitated from NPE that was preincubated with okadaic acid or a control buffer for 20 min, and its activity was measured using MCM2 as a substrate. As shown in Fig.4 A, inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid had no significant effect on Cdc7 kinase activity. Similarly, in order to assay Cdk2 activity, Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from NPE incubated for 30 min with either okadaic acid or a control buffer, and its activity was determined using histone H1 as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 4 B, inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid had no effect on the kinase activity of Cdk2. We therefore conclude that although PP2A is essential for Cdc45 binding to the pre-RC, it does not alter the kinase activities of Cdc7 and Cdk2. To further elucidate the mechanism by which PP2A acts to recruit Cdc45 to the pre-RC, we tested the effect of okadaic acid on several initiation factors known to be required for the loading of Cdc45. It was reported recently by Wohlschlegel et al. (33Wohlschlegel J.A. Dhar S.K. Prokhorova T.A. Dutta A. Walter J.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 233-240Google Scholar) that the recruitment of Cdc45 to the origin of replication is MCM10-dependent and that MCM10 is recruited to the pre-RC following NPE addition. We therefore asked whether PP2A regulates binding of MCM10 to the pre-RC. As shown in Fig. 2 A, lane 5, the recruitment of MCM10 to pre-RC was not affected by okadaic acid. Therefore, PP2A does not act in recruiting Cdc45 by regulating MCM10 binding to chromatin. Since PP2A is a positive factor in Cdc45 loading, it is conceivable that Cdc45 itself is the substrate of PP2A. This would imply that PP2A can only function in the presence of Cdc45. To investigate this possibility, we tested whether PP2A can act in extracts from which Cdc45 was removed by immunodepletion. As outlined in Fig.5 B (reaction 3), sperm chromatin was incubated for 30 min in Cdc45-depleted egg cytosol followed by a 20-min incubation in Cdc45-depleted NPE. During this incubation, PP2A was active in the absence of Cdc45. Okadaic acid was then added and incubated for 2 min to inhibit PP2A without giving the opposing kinase enough time to exert its inhibitory role. Then recombinant Cdc45 was added. If PP2A can perform its function in the absence of Cdc45, then replication would occur. However, if Cdc45 must be present for PP2A to function, then replication would be inhibited. As shown in Fig. 5 A(column 3), PP2A was able to function in the absence of Cdc45. Therefore, PP2A does not regulate Cdc45 recruitment to chromatin by directly dephosphorylating Cdc45. Instead, it appears that PP2A and its opposing protein kinase regulate a factor that controls Cdc45 loading. The presence of this kinase was verified by an experiment outlined in Fig. 5 B, reaction 4. Here the okadaic acid was preincubated for 20 min with Cdc45-depleted NPE, giving the opposing kinase enough time to inactivate the Cdc45 loading factor. Under these conditions, DNA replication was indeed inhibited, as shown in Fig. 5 A(column 4). There was a formal possibility that replication was not inhibited after the 2-min okadaic acid incubation because the recombinant Cdc45 used was previously “activated” and therefore did not need to be acted on by PP2A. To rule out this possibility, we showed that the recombinant Cdc45 could not rescue inhibition of replication by okadaic acid (Fig. 5 B, reaction 5). In other control reactions"

PAH catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-Phe to l-Tyr, the rate-limiting step in the catabolism ofl-Phe (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 67: 77-264Google Scholar, 2Flatmark T.

Rev. 1996; 96: 2659-2756Google Scholar). Genetic defects in the human enzyme (hPAH) cause phenylketonuria, with a broad range of metabolic and clinical phenotypes (4Scriver C.R. Eisensmith R.C.

Mammalian PAH is activated severalfold by preincubation with its substratel-Phe, which represents the most important mechanism for its regulation in hepatocytes (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1993; 67: 77-264Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PAH at Ser16 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) represents an additional post-transcriptional regulation of the enzyme (10Abita J.P. Milstien S. Chang N. Kaufman S. J. Biol.

Enzyme Regul. 1986; 25: 37-64Google Scholar). The two mechanisms of activation are interdependent,i.e. l-Phe enhances its rate of phosphorylation by PKA, and the phosphorylated enzyme requires a lower concentration of substrate for its activation (15Phillips R.S. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2474-2479Google Scholar, 16Døskeland A.P. Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 409-414Google Scholar). It appears that these two mechanisms act synergistically also in vivo and thatl-Phe promotes the phosphorylation and activation of PAH in rat liver (13Tipper J. Kaufman S. J. Biol.

However, the molecular mechanism of this interdependence is not well understood (18Jennings I.G. Teh T. Kobe B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 196-200Google Scholar, 19Wang G.-A., Gu, P. Kaufman S. Proc.

Phosphorylation of the human enzyme results in a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (20Smith S.C. Kemp B.E. McAdam W.J. Mercer J.F. Cotton R.G. J. Biol.

The enzyme expressed in the latter system is recovered as a double band on SDS-PAGE, corresponding to the phosphorylated (∼51 kDa) and nonphosphorylated (∼50 kDa) forms. Furthermore, we have previously shown by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that phosphorylation of the isolated recombinant N-terminal regulatory domain (residues 2–110) results in an apparent increase in the content of α-helical structure (23Chehin R. Thorolfsson M. Knappskog P.M. Martı́nez A. Flatmark T. Arrondo J.L. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 225-230Google Scholar). In the present work we have extended these studies, including molecular modeling by the anchor grow method using the program DOCK 4.0 (24Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 505-524Google Scholar), and the possible conformations of the 18-residue N-terminal tail have been estimated for the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. The modeled conformations have given a structural explanation of the changes in enzyme kinetic properties and conformation observed as a result of phosphorylation. To validate this modeled structure we substituted Ser16 by residues with negatively charged (Glu and Asp) and neutral (Ala) side chains. In addition, we have studied the effect of charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis of residues in the regulatory (Arg13) and catalytic (Glu353and Glu381) domains considered to be involved in electrostatic interactions and thus important for determining the conformation and orientation of the N-terminal tail in the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. The biochemical data support the structures obtained for the full-length enzymes by molecular modeling. Docking and preparation of structures was performed on a SGI Octane workstation. The DOCK 4.0.1 suite of programs (University of California at San Francisco) (24Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput.

The solvent-accessible surface of this domain was calculated by the DMS program under MidasPlus (University of California at San Francisco) (25Ferrin T.E. Hunag C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 13-27Google Scholar), and a grid of 45 Å × 29 Å × 36 Å was constructed in which iron was included as a sphere of the correct radius and without including crystallographic water molecules. The grid is used by DOCK to evaluate the steric boundary of the protein as well as electrostatic and van der Waal's interactions between the protein and the ligand atoms during the docking procedure, using the energy scoring function. The atom potential types and the partial charges of the 19-residue N-terminal peptide were assigned for the AMBER forcefield using InsightII (Accelrys). A grid space of 0.3 Å, a dielectric factor of 4, and a sampling size of 50 configurations/cycle were used. The anchor grow method (26Leach A.R. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 730-748Google Scholar) was used for docking, including energy minimization of the bound peptide structure during docking. The anchor grow method is based on the partition of the ligand (the N-terminal sequence) into rigid segments containing the largest set of adjacent atoms separated by nonrotatable bonds, whose position is optimized during each step. The coordinates for Gly19 were used as anchor for growing the remaining 18 N-terminal residues. The programs InsightII and WebLab Viewer (Accelrys) were used to prepare the figures of the modeled full-length conformers of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated PAH. Snapshots of the structure of each of the 30 lowest energy conformers of the docked peptides with the rest of the protein were prepared using the VMD software (27Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J.

Then the MediaConvert software for IRIX 6.5 (SGI) was used to prepare a video showing the ensemble of the 30 snapshots, with increasing docking score (see the supplemental material).

The phosphorylation of wt-hPAH and its mutant forms (50 μm subunit) was performed at 30 °C for 1 h, in 15 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.03 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 200 nm of PKA catalytic subunit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The reaction was initiated by adding 500 μm MgATP, and the extent of phosphorylation was measured by SDS-PAGE (mobility shift) and/or by 32P autoradiography using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). At these conditions ∼1 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mol isolated hPAH subunit (16Døskeland A.P. Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 409-414Google Scholar). The samples of nonphosphorylated wt-hPAH and mutants utilized in this study were treated at identical conditions as the phosphorylated enzymes, except for the absence of kinase during assay. SDS-PAGE was performed at 15 mA/gel on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels (except as otherwise indicated; see below), containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The gels were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, scanned, and further analyzed using the software Deskscan II (Hewlett-Packard Co.) and Phoretix 1D Plus (Nonlinear Dynamics Ltd). Ferguson plot analyses were performed by running SDS-PAGE at various concentrations of acrylamide (from 8 to 13%, w/v) (30Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem.

The relative electrophoretic mobility (R m) was calculated using standardized gels with molecular mass standards of known radii (Bio-Rad), and the log(R m) was plotted versus the acrylamide concentration (which determines the pore size). Denatured proteins differing only in the effective Stokes radius (hydrated radius of the protein-detergent complex) have different slopes and a common intercept at they axis, whereas proteins differing only in the electrical charge have identical slopes with different y axis intercepts (30Hedrick J.L.

The various forms of hPAH (0.1 μg/μl) were incubated withN-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin from bovine pancreas (Sigma) at various protease:hPAH ratios, i.e. 0.002:1, 0.005:1, 0.01:1, and 0.1:1, in a final volume of 45 μl at 30 °C for 20 min. After quenching the reaction with SDS denaturation buffer by heating for 3 min at 95 °C, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. PAH activity was assayed at 25 °C with a standard reaction mixture (final volume, 50 μl) of 10 μm ferrous ammonium sulfate, 1 mml-Phe, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 75 μm BH4, 0.04 μg/μl catalase, 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg of the various hPAH forms in 100 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, as described (21Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Google Scholar). Two types of reactions were performed: (i) the enzyme was preincubated for 4 min at 25 °C in a mixture containing buffer, l-Phe, and catalase, then Fe(II) was added, and after another 1-min incubation, the reaction was started by the addition of BH4(l-Phe activated enzyme) and (ii) the reaction was performed as above, except that l-Phe is added together with BH4 (nonactivated enzyme). The reaction was stopped after 30 s with 1% (v/v) acetic acid in ethanol. The amount ofl-Tyr was measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and fluorimetric detection (12Døskeland A.P. Døskeland S.O. Øgreid D. Flatmark T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11242-11248Google Scholar, 21Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were determined using variable concentrations of the substrate (0–5 mml-Phe with 75 μmBH4) and of the cofactor (0–500 μmBH4 with 1 mml-Phe) and were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data using the program Enzfitter (Elsevier-Biosoft). CD analyses were performed at 25 °C on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Jasco 423S Peltier element. The samples (10 μm subunit of hPAH forms) were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm KF, pH 7.0, with stoichiometric amounts of ferrous ammonium sulfate. Wavelength scans were taken between 185 and 300 nm using quartz cells with path lengths of 0.1 and 0.5 cm. The data were analyzed with the standard analysis program provided with the instrument. The amount of secondary structure elements was estimated by the CDNN program that applies a neural network procedure (33Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the dimeric C-terminal truncated form of rPAH (Protein Data Bank code 1PHZ) (9Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E. Santarsiero B.D. Stevens R.C. Cotton R.G. Kemp B.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar), no electron density was observed for the 18-residue N-terminal tail. Therefore, to obtain some information on the structure of the full-length enzyme and on the conformational changes induced by phosphorylation of Ser16, we have created a modeled structure of the N-terminal tail by docking the peptide sequence into the crystal structure of rPAH, using DOCK with the anchor grow method (24Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 505-524Google Scholar). Using the coordinates for Gly19 as an anchor for growing the remaining 18 N-terminal residues, the most probable conformations for the 19-residue N-terminal tail was estimated for the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms. The top scoring structures resulting from the molecular docking are shown in Fig. 1 for the nonphosphorylated (Fig. 1 A) and the phosphorylated forms (Fig. 1B) (see also the supplemental material). Whereas the residues 16–18 could be superimposed for the two forms, phosphorylation resulted in a significantly different conformation/orientation of residues 1–15. Furthermore, Arg13 was found to change its electrostatic interactions from Glu353 and Glu381 in the nonphosphorylated enzyme (Fig. 1 C) to the phosphate group of Ser16 (Fig. 1 D). Although the nonphosphorylated tail establishes interactions with residues on both sides of the entrance to the active site crevice structure, leading to a relatively “closed” conformation of this structure, the phosphorylated tail is reoriented along one side of the channel (Table II), resulting in a more open active site conformation. This change in orientation would allow for the proposed facilitated access of the substrate (9Kobe B. Jennings I.G. House C.M. Michell B.J. Goodwill K.E. Santarsiero B.D. Stevens R.C. Cotton R.G. Kemp B.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 442-448Google Scholar) to its binding site close to the iron (34Teigen K. Frøystein N.Å. Martı́nez A. J. Mol.

Open table in a new tab The interactions were determined in the structures shown in Fig. 1. The electrostatic interaction between the phosphate group at Ser16 and Arg13 thus seems to be a key determinant for the different conformation adopted by the phosphorylated enzyme. To further validate this structural model and to get information on the molecular basis for the kinetic and conformational changes that occur in wt-hPAH on phosphorylation, we substituted Ser16 with acidic residues (using alanine as a control) and characterized the biochemical properties of the resulting enzyme forms. The mutants S16A, S16D, and S16E were expressed and purified at similar yields as those obtained for wt-hPAH, i.e. about 35 mg of fusion protein were obtained per liter of bacterial culture, and about 8–12 mg of pure tetrameric enzyme forms were recovered after the cleavage of the fusion protein by EKMaxTM. When wt-hPAH is phosphorylated on Ser16 by PKA, a mobility shift is observed on SDS-PAGE for the phosphorylated form (which appears at an apparentM r of ∼51 kDa) with respect to the nonphosphorylated form (∼50 kDa) (16Døskeland A.P. Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 409-414Google Scholar, 21Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Olafsdottir S. Døskeland A.P. Eiken H.G. Svebak R.M. Bozzini M. Apold J. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 589-597Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A). A similar result was obtained when wt-hPAH expressed in the in vitrotranscription-translation system was analyzed (Ref. 5Bjørgo E. Knappskog P.M. Martı́nez A. Stevens R.C. Flatmark T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 1-10Google Scholar and data not shown). The relative mobilities (R m values) on SDS-PAGE of the S16D and S16E mutants are also lower than that of the nonphosphorylated wt-hPAH, although the mobility shift was less pronounced than that observed for phosphorylated wt-hPAH (Fig.2 A). To get further information on the mobility shift observed for phosphorylated wt-hPAH, the shift was measured as a function of the pore size of the gel and analyzed by the Ferguson plot method (30Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Google Scholar, 31Ferguson K.A. Metabolism. 1964; 13: 985-1002Google Scholar) using standardized gels with protein standards of known radii. From Fig. 2 B it is seen that the difference inR m values between the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated subunits increased with decreasing pore size. These data indicate that the mobility shift results from a change in the effective Stokes radius of the SDS-denatured enzyme, as reported for other proteins (32Li M. Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7869-7877Google Scholar). Analysis of the mobility shift of the mutant forms S16D and S16E relative to nonphosphorylated wt-hPAH or to the S16A mutant showed that the differences in the slope of the log (R m) versus the acrylamide concentration plots were not significant. Attempts to study the mobility shift following phosphorylation under nondenaturing conditions was hampered by the fact that the purified tetrameric enzyme does not show a unique band when subjected to native electrophoresis but rather a smear of multiple bands, 2M.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 6302-6310Google Scholar). As seen from TableIII, the V maxvalues obtained for the three mutant forms S16A, S16D, and S16E were similar to that of wt-hPAH when the enzymes were activated by preincubation with l-Phe. As expected (16Døskeland A.P. Martı́nez A. Knappskog P.M. Flatmark T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 409-414Google Scholar), phosphorylation of hPAH resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in the basal activity (i.e. without l-Phe preincubation) as well as a higher apparent affinity for l-Phe. No significant difference in the degree of substrate activation or the kinetic parameters was measured for the S16A mutant form, as compared with the nonphosphorylated wt-hPAH, whereas the mutants with the negatively charged residues, notably S16E, revealed a higher basal activity and a lower [S]0.5 value for l-Phe, thus partially mimicking the phosphorylated form (Table III). The characteristic positive kinetic cooperativity of l-Phe binding to tetrameric PAH, with a Hill coefficient of h =∼2 (1Kaufman S. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Purified LamB was reconstituted in artificial lipid bilayer membranes forming channels in the permanently open configuration at neutral pH. Almost complete channel closure was observed when the pH on both sides of the membrane was lowered to pH 4. When LamB was added to only one side of the membrane, the cis-side, and the pH was lowered at either side of the membrane, the cis- or the trans-side, the response to pH was asymmetric, suggesting preferential orientation of maltoporin channels and pH- dependent closure of only one side of the channel. In experiments with LamB mutants in which major external loops L4, L6, and/or L9 were deleted, we identified the surface-exposed loops L4 and L6 as the cause of pH-mediated closure. The pH dependence of the LamB channel is consistent with the assumption that it inserts in a preferential orientation into the lipid bilayer. About 70–80% of the reconstituted channels are oriented with the extracellular entrance toward the side to which the protein was added (the cis-side) and with the periplasmic opening on the opposite side (the trans-side). The possibility of closing the channels, which are oriented in the reverse direction by low pH at the trans-side, allowed the deduction of channel asymmetry with respect to carbohydrate binding kinetics. Whereas maltose binding was found to be almost symmetric with respect to the channel orientation, the sucrose and trehalose binding to LamB was asymmetric. The results are discussed in respect to possible physiological function of the pH-dependent closure of maltoporin.

Immun. 1977; 16: 145-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Water-filled channels, the so-called porins, allow the passage of solutes through this diffusion barrier. Porins are divided in two classes: general diffusion pores, which sort solutes according to their molecular mass, and specific pores, which have a binding site for specific substrates inside the channel and facilitate the diffusion of these substrates through the outer membrane (3Benz R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 4Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the last few years the structure of several porins were solved by x-ray crystallography (5Cowan S.W. Schirmer T. Rummel G. Steiert M. Ghosh R. Pauptit R.A. Jansonius J.N. Rosenbusch J.P.

Porins are built of three identical polypeptide subunits (monomers). The common structure of the monomers is a barrel formed by 16 or 18 antiparallel β-strands connected by small turns on the periplasmic side and by long loops on the extracellular side. In all known porin structures loop 3, between β-strands 5 and 6, is folded inside the channel and leads to a decrease in the diameter of the constriction of the channel. The other loops form a protrusion that protects the extracellular entrance of the outer membrane channels. LamB (maltoporin) from Escherichia coli is a specific porin for malto-oligosaccharides (8Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The monomer is composed of 18 β-strands, which means that there are nine extracellular loops. The binding site inside the channel is composed of six aromatic amino acids that line the channel lumen from the extracellular to the periplasmic opening (6Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In addition to this so-called “greasy slide” there are several amino acid residues inside the channel that are involved in malto-oligosaccharide binding (10Dutzler R. Wang Y.F. Rizkallah P. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. Structure. 1996; 4: 127-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Jordy M. Andersen C. Schülein K. Ferenci T. Benz R. J. Mol.

In a previous study we investigated the influence of the extracellular loops on maltoporin function in vivo and in vitro (13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Deletion of the large loops L4 or L6 leads to instability of the protrusion. This instability influences the binding kinetics of malto-oligosaccharides entering the pore from the extracellular side. The deletion of the three major loops (L4, L6, and L9) has no effect on sugar binding, and the mutant shows wild-type characteristics inin vitro experiments. So, the interaction of the loops seems to be crucial for the stability of the protrusion built by loops L4, L6, and L9. General diffusion pores from E. coli outer membrane have been shown susceptible to low pH. In particular, low pH leads to channel closure in the case of OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE (14Xu G.Z. Shi B.

Schirmer T. Rosenbusch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20676-20680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Low pH may also be involved in cadaverine-mediated channel block (19DelaVega A.L. Delcour A.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6058-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Atomic force microscopy of OmpF at low pH suggests that a conformation change of the loops exposed to the external surface is the reason for channel closure at low pH (20Müller D.J. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1347-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the influence of low pH on the properties of the maltoporin channel, which had not been studied yet at low pH. We show that pH 4 leads to an almost complete closure of the maltoporin channel and provide evidence that the closure is due to destabilization of the protrusion on the extracellular side. This allows some insight into which direction maltoporin inserts into artificial bilayers and provides a method of studying sugar binding in a system with oriented inserted maltoporin channels in lipid bilayer membranes. The results are discussed in respect to the possible role of maltoporin closure in protecting the organism from drastic changes of the environment. Wild-type LamB of E. coli was purified as published previously (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar,22Schülein K. Andersen C. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The deletion mutants ΔL4, ΔL6, ΔL9v, ΔL4+L6, and ΔL4+L6+L9v affecting loops L4 (residues 148–165), L6 (residues 239–263), and L9 (residues 379–401) were constructed and purified as has previously been described (13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Black lipid bilayer membranes were formed from a 1% solution of diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in n-decane as described previously (23Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Läuger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The instrumentation consists of a Teflon chamber with two aqueous compartments filled with electrolyte (1m KCl). The compartments are connected by a small circular hole with a 0.3-mm2 surface area across which the membranes were formed. The electrolyte solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was buffered by Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and citrate/KOH, pH 4.0, respectively, to a final maximal concentration of 20 mm. To exclude the possibility that the closure of pores by adding citrate is an effect of citrate binding to maltoporin comparable with that observed for malto-oligosaccharide, we also used phosphate buffer, MES,1 or HCl to decrease the pH with the same effect as with citrate (data not shown). The membrane current was measured with a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes with salt bridges switched in series with a voltage source and a current amplifier (Keithley 427 with a four-pole filter or a current to voltage converter made using a Burr Brown operational amplifier with a three-pole filter). The feedback resistors of the current amplifier were between 0.01 and 10 gigaohms. The amplified signal was monitored with a strip chart recorder to measure the absolute magnitude of the membrane current. Maltoporin or the deletion mutants were added from concentrated stock solutions to both sides or only one side of the membrane. The reconstitution of channels in the black lipid membrane could be monitored on a strip chart recorder by a stepwise increase of the membrane current. The pH of the electrolyte was changed by adding buffer to the same side (cis-side) or the other side (trans-side) with respect to the addition of protein (the cis-side). The temperature was kept at 20 °C and the membrane potential at 20 mV throughout. Binding of maltose and sucrose to maltoporin were investigated as described in previous publications (24Benz R. Schmid A. Nakae T. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Binding of the substrate to the binding site inside the channel could be detected because the current through the channel is blocked when the binding site is occupied. Shortly after the membrane turned black, the protein was added to the aqueous compartment (final concentration 100 ng/ml). The membrane conductance increased by the reconstitution of channels. After 20–30 min the increase slowed down. When the conductance was nearly constant the titration experiment started, and carbohydrates were added in defined concentrations to one or both sides of the membrane. Subsequently the membrane conductance decreased in a dose-dependent manner as a result of the channel block for ions because of substrate binding. In earlier experiments (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 21Andersen C. Jordy M. Benz R. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 105: 385-401Google Scholar) the carbohydrates were added to the aqueous phase on both sides of the membrane. In the present study we expanded the protocol in such a way that carbohydrate was also added to one side of the membrane only, e.g. to either the cis-side (side′; the side of the addition of LamB, carbohydrate concentration c′) or the trans-side (side“; the opposite side of the membrane, carbohydrate concentrationc”). In the case where carbohydrate is added to both sides of the membrane in equal concentration (c′ = c“= c) the relative conductance inhibition is given by Gmax−G(c)Gmax=K·c1+K·cEquation 1 where G max represents the conductance of a LamB-containing membrane prior to the addition of carbohydrate,G(c) the conductance in the presence of carbohydrate, and K the stability constant for carbohydrate binding. This means that the titration curves can be analyzed using Lineweaver-Burk plots as shown in previous publications for carbohydrate-specific porins (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Benz R. Schmid A. Nakae T. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 978-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The stability constant, K, for carbohydrate binding to the binding site inside the LamB channel is given by K=k1′k−1′=k″1k″−1=k1′+k″1k−1′+k″−1Equation 2 k′1 and k“1represent the on-rate constants for carbohydrate binding from the cis-side and the trans-side, respectively, to the binding site. The off-rate constants are given by k′−1 andk”−1. In the case of symmetric kinetics of carbohydrate binding to maltoporin (k′1 =k“1 and k′−1 =k”−1), Equation 2 is reduced to K=k1k−1Equation 3 In contrast, when the carbohydrate is added to only one side of the membrane (c′ = c; c“ = 0) and the channels are fully oriented, the relative conductance inhibition is given by Gmax−G(c)Gmax=K′·c1+K′·cEquation 4 or, depending on the orientation of the channels, by Gmax−G(c)Gmax=K″·c1+K″·cEquation 5 K′ and K“ are given by K′=k1′k−1′+k″−1andK″=k″1k−1′+k″−1Equation 6 Note that K′ and K“ cannot be compared with the stability constant K given in Equation 2, as they do not represent the stability constants for carbohydrate binding to the binding site inside the channel. Rather, K′/K” reflects the ratio of the on-rates of the binding processes from the two different sides (i.e. K′/K“ =k′1/k”1). For the study of the pH dependence of maltoporin, purified LamB was added to both sides of the membrane bathed in an aqueous potassium chloride solution buffered with 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The membrane conductance increased in a stepwise fashion caused by reconstitution of maltoporin into the membrane. When the reconstitution process slowed down and the membrane conductance became stationary, the pH of the electrolyte solution on both sides of the membrane was decreased in steps by adding sodium citrate, pH 4.0 (Fig. 1). The resulting pH was determined by measuring the pH of a 50-μl sample of the aqueous compartments using a pH electrode. Lowering the pH to 4.73 by adding the buffer had virtually no influence on membrane conductance. At pH 4.63 the membrane conductance started to decrease. A further decrease of the pH to 4.51 and 4.40 and then to 4.28 continued this process, and the membrane conductance went down to a constant level of about 5% of its initial value at pH 4.02, which could not be reduced further at even lower pH. The same influence on LamB-mediated membrane conductance was also observed when other acids and buffers, such as MES and phosphate and hydrochloric acid instead of citrate, were used to decrease the pH. This excludes the possibility that the decrease of the conductance is caused by a block of the channels by the binding of citrate to the binding side inside the channel similar to that observed for malto-oligosaccharides (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Taken together the decrease in membrane conductance was definitely caused by low pH. Theinset in Fig. 1 shows the fraction of open channels as a function of pH. It is noteworthy that the experimental data could not be explained by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which suggests that not a single amino acid is responsible for channel closure. It seems, moreover, that it is a cooperative process. One possible explanation for this effect is that low pH leads to the removal of maltoporin from the membrane or the complete destruction of its channel function. This explanation could be excluded by shifting the pH back to 7.0 after acidification by the addition of Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The membrane conductance increased again and reached approximately its initial level (before lowering the pH), demonstrating that the pH-induced decrease was reversible. Thus, we concluded that maltoporin channels are gated by low pH in a manner similar to that demonstrated previously for the general diffusion porins OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE (14Xu G.Z. Shi B.

McGroarty E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1498-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The results suggested also that a conformational change is responsible for the reversible closure of the pores at pH levels lower than 4.7. In the next set of experiments, LamB was added to both sides of the membrane, but the pH was first lowered to pH 4.0 on one side of the membrane and then on the other to the same pH (Fig.2 a). When the pH was decreased on one side to 4.0 (leftmost arrow), membrane conductance first increased somewhat, probably because of the increased channel conductance due to increased concentration of protons. Then it diminished to about 45% of its initial value. A further decrease was observed when pH was also lowered on the other side to 4.0 (second arrow from left). In agreement with the results described above, the final conductance reached values of only about 5–10% of the initial membrane conductance when both sides of the membrane had a pH of 4.0. Similar to the description above, the pH-mediated closure was reversible when pH was increased again to 6, first on the trans- and then on the cis-side (two rightmost arrows). Protein was added to both sides of the membrane in the experiments described above, and the decrease was about 45% of the initial membrane conductance when the pH on one side was lowered. This behavior was different when maltoporin was added to only one side of the membrane (the cis-side, Fig. 2 b). Lowering the pH on the trans-side to 4.1 reduced the conductance by about 20–30% of its initial value (left side of Fig. 2 b) compared with a reduction of 70–80% in the same experiments when the pH was decreased on the cis-side to pH 4.1 (right side of Fig.2 b). Again, in both cases the residual membrane conductance could be reduced to about 5–10% of the initial level also when both compartments were acidified. These experiments demonstrate that acidifying only one side of the membrane is sufficient to induce channel closure. The difference between the experiments in which the protein was added to one or both sides of the membrane can only be explained when it is assumed that maltoporin does not insert randomly but in a preferred orientation into the membranes. Low pH at the cis-side induces the closure of the pores inserted in the preferred orientation. The orientation of maltoporin when it is added to one of the membrane is about 70–80%, which is in agreement with the results of the experiment described above and also with those of a previous study (13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To detect the pH-induced maltoporin closure on the single-channel level, we added only a small amount of wild-type protein (final concentration about 5 ng/ml) to one side of a membrane. After reconstitution of only one channel into the membrane, the pH was lowered at the cis-side to 4 (left arrow in Fig. 3). First, an increase of the conductance could be observed as seen in the multi-channel experiments, probably caused by the higher single-channel conductance of LamB at an increased proton concentration (pH 4). Subsequently the conductance decreased to almost zero in three distinct steps of the same size (about 65 picosiemens; see Fig. 3). In the next step the pH was also lowered to 4 on the trans-side (middle arrow), which had no further effect on conductance. Then, the pH on the cis-side was neutralized by adding Tris/HCl (right arrow in Fig. 3). As a consequence the channel opened again in three distinct steps and had the same conductance as before the pH was lowered on the cis-side (150 picosiemens). Neutralizing the trans-side also had no effect on the channel conductance (data not shown). This experiment demonstrates that the three monomers within a LamB trimer close and open independently from one another as a reaction to pH change in the cis-compartment. In a previous study (13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) we demonstrated that certain LamB loop mutants also showed preferential orientation and asymmetric carbohydrate binding when added to only one side of the membrane. Looking for the basis of the pH-induced channel closure of LamB wild type, we tested maltoporin mutants in which the three major external loops, L4, L6, and L9, are deleted separately or in combination. Our previous work (13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) showed that the mutants ΔL4, ΔL6, ΔL9v, ΔL4+L6, andΔL4+L6+L9v are expressed in a LamB-deficient E. coli strain. They can be purified from the outer membrane and form channels when reconstituted in black lipid membranes (13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Each mutant protein was added to both sides of the membrane, and pH dependence was tested in the same way as described above for LamB wild type. The mutant ΔL4+L6+L9v, in which all three major loops were deleted, showed no conductance decrease after the pH was lowered to 4.0 on the cis- and the trans-sides (Fig. 4). This was clear evidence that the pH-induced closure of LamB wild type is not the result of conformational changes inside the channel lumen but has its origin in the extracellular loops, which become unstable under acidic conditions and collapse into the channel lumen and block it for the permeation of ions. Further experiments with the single-loop deletion mutants ΔL4, ΔL6, and ΔL9v were performed to examine which loops are involved in the closing event. The mutants ΔL4 and ΔL6 as well as the combination ΔL4+L6 showed no pH-induced closure, whereas acidic pH led to the closure of the mutant ΔL9v. We therefore concluded that the two major loops, L4 and L6, are responsible for the closure. Combining the knowledge that lowering the pH at the cis-side had a greater effect when LamB wild type was added to only one side (the cis-side; see above) and that the extracellular loops are the origin of the pH-induced closure, we concluded that the preferred orientation of the LamB trimers in artificial lipid bilayers is with the periplasmic end first. The extracellular loops point toward the cis-side and lead to almost complete channel closure when pH is decreased at this side to pH 4. The investigation of carbohydrate binding to LamB under asymmetric conditions has been a problem because the orientation of maltoporin in artificial membranes was not known. Furthermore it has been a matter of debate as to whether the channel is asymmetric with respect to carbohydrate binding and transport (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Orlik F. Andersen C. Benz R. Biophys.

The pH-induced block of reconstituted maltoporin channels offers an elegant way to manipulate the reconstituted channels, in a way that all open channels have the same orientation, whereas the channels in the other orientation are closed. It allowed a detailed investigation of carbohydrate binding under asymmetric conditions. The asymmetric binding constants K′ and K“ and the stability constant K (see “Experimental Procedures”) were derived by titration experiments in which the ion flux through the channels is blocked when carbohydrate molecules are bound to the binding site inside the channel. To exclude the possibility that the pH change influences carbohydrate binding, we used LamBΔL4+L6+L9v as a control. Its carbohydrate binding characteristics were very similar to that of LamB wild type (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Andersen C. Bachmeyer C. Täuber H. Benz R. Wang J. Michel V. Newton S.M. Hofnung M. Charbit A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 851-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because the mutant channels do not close under acidic conditions (see above), it was possible to determine the carbohydrate binding constants at pH 4.0. The binding constant of maltose added to both sides is almost identical (K neutral = 200 m−1;K acidic = 220 m−1) to that measured at neutral conditions, demonstrating that the carbohydrate binding is not affected by pH. The asymmetric carbohydrate-binding experiments were performed in a manner similar to that described above for the experiments in which the pH was lowered. The protein was added to one compartment (the cis-side), and the trans-compartment was acidified to close the channels oriented with their extracellular side (the side of the loops) toward the trans-compartment (Fig. 5). This means that the membrane conductance is due to maltoporin channels in which the extracellular side points exclusively toward the cis-side. We determined the asymmetric binding constants of maltose, sucrose, and trehalose added either from the cis-side (extracellular side) or the trans-side (the periplasmic side). TableI shows that the binding of maltose is 1.5-fold better if it is added from the cis-side (the external side;K′ = 170 ± 20 m−1) than from the trans-side (the periplasmic side) of the channel (K“ = 110 ± 20 m−1). This result suggests that the asymmetry of the LamB channel is indeed very small. For sucrose the asymmetric binding constants K′ and K” differed more substantially (K′ = 130 ± 30m−1 and K“ = 6 ± 4m−1). This means that for sucrose the difference between cis and trans addition is more than 20-fold. For trehalose the asymmetric binding constants were also significantly different. Binding from the extracellular site is 3-fold better than from the periplasmic side (K′ = 42 ± 2m−1, K′ = 13 ± 2m−1). A comparison with earlier data in which protein and carbohydrates were added to both sides of the membranes shows satisfactory agreement with the present data (9Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that it is impossible without the pH-induced closure of one population of channels to determine the asymmetric binding constants, because the conductance decrease in titration experiments is always caused by channels blocked by substrate entering from their extracellular or periplasmic side.Table IApparent stability constants for maltose, sucrose, and trehalose binding to maltoporin from the extracellular or the periplasmic sideK′ extracellular sideK“ periplasmic sideK aAddition of protein and carbohydrate to both side.M−1M−1Maltose170 ± 20110 ± 20100bTaken from Ref. 9.Sucrose130 ± 306 ± 467bTa"

We report a novel biochemical technique, called misincorporation proton-alkyl exchange (MPAX), that can be used to footprint protein structure at single amino acid resolution. MPAX exploits translational misincorporation of cysteine residues to generate probes for physical analysis. We apply MPAX to the triosephosphate isomerase (β/α)8 barrel, accurately determining its substrate-binding site, a protein-protein interaction surface, the solvent-accessible protein surface, and the stability of the barrel. Because MPAX requires only microgram quantities of material and is not limited by protein size, it is ideally suited for proteins not amenable to conventional structural methods, such as membrane proteins, partially folded or insoluble proteins, and large protein complexes.

In principle, protein footprinting provides a means to study protein structure, but it has been far less successful than the corresponding techniques developed for nucleic acids (1Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Because of the chemical heterogeneity of the amino acid side chains, no reagent exists with the ability to cleave uniformly the protein backbone under native conditions. Furthermore, protein separation techniques such as SDS-PAGE do not possess the single monomer resolution of the urea-acrylamide gels used for the separation of nucleic acids, which complicates the analysis of observed cleavage patterns. Finally, because of the cooperative nature of protein unfolding, proteolytic cleavage at one site often leads to a global loss of structure and to increased cleavage at other sites in the same molecule, resulting in artifactual data. Footprinting by chemical modification of amino acid side chains represents a different approach to the problem. Modification of side chains is carried out under native conditions, whereas detection of modifications can be performed under arbitrary conditions. The susceptibility of each side chain to modification reports its solvent accessibility. Acylation of lysine residues (2Doonan S. Fahmy H.M. Eur. J.

These studies have been limited in scope, however, because they examine only a few naturally occurring residues or require extensive site-directed mutagenesis to introduce additional structural probes. Here we describe a new experimental approach, termed misincorporation proton-alkyl exchange (MPAX),1 that overcomes many of the limitations of traditional protein footprinting and facilitates high throughput analysis. MPAX utilizes the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues as reactive sites that can be modified specifically under native conditions. Because cysteine residues occur naturally at a low frequency, auxiliary cysteines must be introduced into a protein of interest to act as structural probes. An expedient strategy for introducing cysteine residues is to subvert the protein translational machinery. Recently, mutant bacterial cysteine tRNAs were created by substituting the cysteine anti-codon triplet with an isoleucine or methionine anti-codon triplet (7Doring V. Marliere P. Genetics. 1998; 150: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar). These tRNAs were demonstrated to misincorporate cysteine at isoleucine and methionine codons complementary to the mutant triplets. Based on this finding, we engineered anti-codon variants of the cysteine tRNA that substitute cysteine residues for a variety of other amino acids. These misincorporator tRNAs are expressed from autonomous plasmids that can be co-transformed with arbitrary protein expression vectors. The MPAX strategy is outlined in Fig. 1. Co-expression of a cysteine misincorporator tRNA with a protein of interest in Escherichia coli results in cysteine being misincorporated at low frequency for one type of amino acid. The substituted proteins are exposed to a thiol-specific alkylating reagent. The rate of alkylation at each misincorporated cysteine provides a measurement of its solvent accessibility. Cysteine alkylation is measured by mass spectrometry or by protection from backbone cleavage by the cysteine-specific cutting reagent 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) (8Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because misincorporation occurs at a single amino acid type, cleavage sites are generally distant in the sequence, and cleavage fragments can be separated using SDS-PAGE. Combining data from separate gel lanes for misincorporation at different amino acids overcomes the intrinsic limitations of these gels and can provide structural information at single amino acid resolution. Because typical misincorporation frequencies are ∼1%/site, a very small fraction of proteins is expected to contain more than a single cysteine substitution. Rates of modification at slowly reacting sites can be measured accurately despite the existence of rapidly reacting sites, because the misincorporated cysteines are located in different molecules. The method is not limited by protein size or solubility and requires only microgram quantities of material. The E. colicysteine tRNA was cloned under the control of the T7 promoter of the pET21a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the E. coli cysteinyl tRNA synthetase was cloned into theBglII and SphI sites of the same plasmid to generate pMPAX. Derivative misincorporator plasmids were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis (9Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J.

The two native cysteines were substituted by Kunkel mutagenesis to generate the C41V/C126A double mutant designated pH6_TIM_PKA. BL21(DE3) cells were co-transformed with pH6_TIM_PKA and the pMPAX derivative of interest. The cultures were grown in M63 medium (11Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G.

Ten μg of purified protein was radioactively labeled by incubation with [γ-33P]ATP and protein kinase A (Sigma). Alkylation of cysteines was accomplished by incubating the protein in 50 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 10 mm iodoacetamide for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. NTCB cleavage at cysteine residues was performed as described (8Jacobson G.R. Schaffer M.H. Stark G.R. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6583-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wu J. Watson J.T. Anal.

An equal volume of 8 m guanidinium chloride, 300 mmsodium bicine, pH 8.6, 100 mm NTCB was added to the protein sample and incubated for 5 min. The cyanylated proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (13Arnold U. Ulbrich-Hofmann R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of 8 m urea, 0.1 mNH4OH. After a 1-h incubation, 5 μl of 500 mmTris chloride, pH 6.5, 25% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.001% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 was added to quench the cleavage, and the resulting solution was loaded onto a Tricine gel (14Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) with an additional comb gel layer (15Wiltfang J. Arold N. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This protocol resulted in an average cleavage efficiency of 84%. Molecular weight markers were constructed by creating a series of single cysteine mutants of TIM by Kunkel mutagenesis. The pooled proteins were cleaved with NTCB to generate a ladder of defined peptides. The gels were run at 140–160 volts overnight, transferred onto Whatman 3MM Chr paper, and dried. The gels were exposed on image plates and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Labeled protein misincorporated at leucine or valine was incubated with or without 50 mmsodium glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in 200 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 10 mm iodoacetamide for 2 min before quenching and cleavage. Illustrations were generated using MOLSCRIPT (16Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and the 7TIM structure (17Davenport R.C. Bash P.A. Seaton B.A. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5821-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The Myc epitope sequence (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted at position 132 in the yeast TIM sequence by Kunkel mutagenesis. The denatured protein was diluted from 5m urea into a reaction containing a final concentration of 1 m urea, 50 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 150 mm NaCl with or without 1 μl of polyclonal anti-Myc serum and incubated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 2 min. Labeled protein was prepared and incubated for 24 h with 50 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 10 mm iodoacetamide. The samples were taken at various time points, acid-quenched, and stored at −20 °C. The protection factor at each position was defined as the ratio of the observed rate of alkylation in the unfolded state to the observed rate of alkylation in the folded protein. The results are the averages of three independent measurements. Alkylation rates in the unfolded state were measured to be 3.3 ± 0.1m−1 s−1 in 4 m GdmCl, 50 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 25 °C for all probes. This value was corrected to 1.5 m−1s−1 for denaturant-free buffer based on the effect of GdmCl on the alkylation rate of glutathione. The fractional burial of each side chain was calculated using X-PLOR (18Brunger A. X-PLOR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and the 7TIM structure. To determine the stability of TIM, labeled protein at a final concentration of 2 μm was incubated with 50 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 10 mm iodoacetamide for 5 h in the presence of 0.7–1.1 m GdmCl (in 0.1m increments). The values of RT*ln(protection factor) for valine 91 were plotted against denaturant concentration and extrapolated linearly to zero. The unfolding free energy of TIM was evaluated as the y intercept. The Helicobacter pylori amidase AmiE was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and cloned between the BglII and SphI sites of pET24a (Novagen) to generate pAmiE. Mutations at Cys165 were created by Kunkel mutagenesis. Mutant pMPAX libraries were generated by treating 10 μg of pMPAX(GUG) or pMPAX(GCU) DNA with ultraviolet light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30 s. The libraries were transformed into BL21(DE3) Tuner cells (Novagen) containing pAmiE with either a C165S or a C165H mutation, resulting in 105–106 transformants. pMPAX plasmids from cells that grew faster than the parent plasmid in acetamide medium (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 μm citric acid, 50 μm FeCl3, 25 μm MnCl2, 25 μmCaCl2, 100 mm acetamide, 25 μmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 20 μg/ml kanamycin) were isolated, co-transformed with pH6_TIM_PKA, and screened for misincorporation efficiency. Details of the synthesis and characterization of the ICAT reagents are provided as supplementary material upon request. Wild-type TIM was incubated with 10 mm13C-ICAT, 50 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, at room temperature for 10, 300, or 1440 min. 12C-ICAT was added to 100 mm, followed by guanidinium chloride to 4 m, and the reactions were incubated for 45 min. Two samples of wild-type TIM were treated respectively with 100 mm of 13C-ICAT or12C-ICAT in 100 mm sodium bicine, pH 8.6, 4m guanidinium chloride for 1 h and then pooled to generate a control sample with a 1:1 ratio of12C:13C at each misincorporated cysteine. The samples were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to remove excess alkylating reagents and resuspended in 5 m urea. The urea was diluted to 0.5 m in 100 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.0, 25 μg/ml sequencing-grade trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the protein was digested overnight at 37 °C. The samples were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatant was added to 250 μl of phenylboronate acrylamide beads (Pierce) pre-equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm sodium HEPES, pH 9.0, 500 mm NaF, 10% acetonitrile). The mixture was rotated for 30 min and then washed for three 30-min incubations with 1 ml of binding buffer. Modified peptides were eluted by two 15-min incubations with 250 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.0, 100 mm sorbitol, 10% acetonitrile). The eluates were pooled, concentrated under vacuum, and injected onto a 1 × 50-mm C18 column (Michrom, Auburn, CA) in buffer A (0.025% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1% formic acid in water) and eluted in a linear gradient of 5–70% buffer B (0.022% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.085% formic acid in acetonitrile) over 50 min. Eluting peptides were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry on an LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) at the Stanford Mass Spectrometry Facility essentially as described in Ref. 19Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4324) Google Scholar. No difference in the elution times of the 13C-ICAT or12C-ICAT modified peptides was observed. The entire peak area was integrated for calculation of the mass ratio. A cysteine-free variant of yeast TIM was used as a model system to investigate the MPAX technique. TIM is a dimeric (β/α)8 barrel protein. The TIM construct used here includes a C-terminal protein kinase A tag to allow labeling with radioactive phosphate, and an N-terminal His6tag on a 30-amino acid linker for purification. This linker shifts the full-length, 290-residue protein away from the fainter cleavage products during gel electrophoresis. We first verified that cysteine could be misincorporated at specific amino acid positions by expressing TIM in the presence or absence of a series of cysteine misincorporator tRNAs. Cleavage of TIM by NTCB is observed only when TIM is co-expressed with a misincorporator tRNA (Fig. 2a). The observed ladder of cleavage bands depends on the anti-codon sequence of the tRNA and corresponds to the pattern expected based on the amino acid sequence of TIM (Fig. 2a). Amino acid analysis confirmed the presence of low levels of cysteine (∼0.3 cysteines/protein) in the purified proteins. Treatment of the protein with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 2 min under denaturing conditions completely blocked cleavage at misincorporated cysteines (Fig. 2b). However, treatment of the protein with iodoacetamide under native conditions did not block cleavage at most sites. The data suggest that protein structure protects these residues from alkylation. Strategies for chemically mapping protein interaction sites fall into three broad categories: interference, cross-linking, and protection (20Creighton T.E. Proteins. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993: 333-334Google Scholar). Interference is based on scanning mutagenesis of a protein. If a residue substitution interferes with a physical interaction, it is inferred that the residue plays a role in binding. In the chemical cross-linking approach, residues that participate in cross-links are identified, and the existence of the cross-link implies spatial proximity to the binding partner. Finally, protection methods are based on chemical modification of a protein in the presence and absence of a binding partner. Binding sites are identified as residues protected from modification by the presence of the partner. The three techniques provide distinct and complementary information. For example, protection and interference experiments identify regions of a protein that undergo a conformational change upon binding, whereas cross-linking only maps direct contact surfaces. Each of the chemical mapping techniques can be carried out in conjunction with parallel misincorporation of cysteine residues. Because the protection strategy is most general with respect to multiple proteins and multiple binding partners, we describe a protection experiment here. To footprint the ligand-binding site of triosephosphate isomerase, TIM protein with misincorporated cysteines was alkylated with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 2 min in the presence and absence of 50 mm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, its substrate. Binding of substrate was found to specifically protect a subset of the fastest alkylating residue positions (Fig.3a). Three of these are located in close proximity to the crystallographically determined substrate-binding site (Fig. 3b) and correspond to the only solvent-accessible (less than 99% buried) valine and leucine residues within 15 Å of the substrate. A fourth residue protected by the substrate is located in the dimerization loop, which makes contacts to the substrate in the opposite monomer. We also investigated the utility of MPAX for mapping a protein-protein interaction surface. Because native triosephosphate isomerase is a homodimer that does not interact with other protein partners, we created tagged variants of TIM with Myc epitope insertions before or after the fifth helix of the barrel. We were not able to refold either tagged protein, so the antibody binding experiment was performed with denatured TIM. Anti-Myc antibodies specifically protected from alkylation only cysteine residues misincorporated within the Myc epitope, providing a direct mapping of the antibody-binding site (Fig. 4). Alkylation at single amino acid resolution was observed by separating leucine and isoleucine bands in different gel lanes. The data demonstrate the utility of MPAX for examining partially folded proteins. Importantly, a protein-binding interface was revealed in a single experiment. Current de novoprotein structure prediction algorithms yield multiple reasonable structural models given an input sequence. The inclusion of sparse experimental NMR data in the prediction process significantly improves the accuracy and convergence of the computed models (21Bowers P.M. Strauss C.E.M. Baker D. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that MPAX data might also be useful for guiding computational structure prediction, we investigated whether MPAX could be used to map a protein surface. The alkylation rates of cysteine residues misincorporated at 61 positions in the TIM sequence were measured. Solvent-exposed residues are expected to alkylate more rapidly than buried residues, and thus alkylation rates should be useful for assigning sequence positions to interior or exterior environments. The observed alkylation rates can be interpreted using a kinetic model derived from hydrogen exchange experiments (22Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). In this model, the solvent accessibility of each cysteine side chain is described by an equilibrium between unfolded, solvent-accessible states and a folded, solvent-inaccessible state (Fig. 1c). Alkylation is assumed to occur only in the exposed states. The factor by which native protein structure slows alkylation of a cysteine residue (relative to the rate of alkylation of the same cysteine in the unfolded state) defines a protection factor for the site of misincorporation. Large protection factors indicate side chain burial, and the magnitude of protection increases in proportion to local protein stability. Protection factors were measured by incubating TIM for 24 h under native conditions in the presence of 10 mm iodoacetamide. The samples were withdrawn periodically and analyzed by NTCB cleavage. This procedure allows accurate measurement of rates up to 104-fold slower than the intrinsic alkylation rate (a protection factor of 104). All of the side chains at sites displaying a protection factor greater than 103 are more than 94% buried in the crystal structure of the wild-type protein (Fig. 5, b and c). Conversely, all side chains at sites displaying protection factors less than 10 are at least 30% solvent-accessible. The correlation between residue burial and protection shows that MPAX can be used to assign amino acid positions to the interior or exterior of a protein, providing a constraint on the topology of the protein backbone fold. The equilibrium stability of TIM cannot be measured by spectroscopic methods because even moderate concentrations of the unfolded polypeptide aggregate. However, protection factors can provide a direct measure of protein stability under native conditions, when >99% of the protein is folded. 2The protection factor is equal to the equilibrium constant between folded and unfolded states when the rate of conformational closing is much faster than the rate of alkylation, a kinetic regime called EX2 (22Bai Y. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Science. 1995; 269: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). All of the alkylation rates were found to depend on the concentration of alkylating reagent, confirming that alkylation occurs by the EX2 mechanism. Protection factors for all of the buried probes were measured at various denaturant concentrations (data not shown). The denaturant dependence of the protection factor for the cysteine misincorporated at valine 91, one of the slowest exchanging residues in TIM, indicates that this cysteine mutant of TIM is 8.5 kcal mol−1 stable at 2 μm concentration (Fig. 5d). MPAX allows measurement of thermodynamic quantities for large and poorly folding proteins like TIM, permitting the kind of energetic analysis currently restricted to small proteins. For MPAX to be most broadly applicable, misincorporation at a variety of amino acids is required. Accordingly, the efficiency of misincorporation by 18 anti-codon mutants of the cysteine tRNA was investigated. The observed misincorporation levels varied over a fairly narrow range (Table I), with the differences probably reflecting proofreading activity of the cysteinyl tRNA synthetase. Only the tRNA complementary to the serine codon AGC caused an obvious impairment in cell growth. Misincorporation appears to follow normal wobble base pairing rules (23Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4 Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1996: 886-888Google Scholar). For example, the Val(GAC) tRNA misincorporated cysteine equally well at GUC or GUU codons, but not at GUG or GUA codons (data not shown).Table IMisincorporation efficiency at different codonsAmino acidCodonApparent cleavage efficiency1-aAverage intensity of cleavage bands relative to the total protein.%CysUGC84.0TyrUAC1.9IleAUC0.7ValGUC0.7LeuCUC0.7His (selected)CAC0.7PheUUC0.6TrpUGG0.4Ser (selected)AGC0.4AspGAC0.3AlaGCU0.2ArgCGU0.2ThrACU0.1AsnAAC<0.1GlnCAA<0.1GluGAA<0.1GlyGGU<0.1HisCAC<0.1LysAAG<0.1ProCCU<0.1SerUCG<0.1SerAGC—1-b—, this tRNA construct is toxic in BL21 (DE3) cells.1-a Average intensity of cleavage bands relative to the total protein.1-b —, this tRNA construct is toxic in BL21 (DE3) cells. Open table in a new tab To expand the number of amino acids to which MPAX can be applied, we increased the misincorporation efficiency at serine and histidine codons using a genetic selection described previously (7Doring V. Marliere P. Genetics. 1998; 150: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar). The selection is based on expression of the H. pylori amidase AmiE in E. coli. AmiE function is required for growth ofE. coli with acetamide as the sole nitrogen source. Mutation of the essential catalytic residue Cys165 in AmiE eliminates enzymatic function (24Kobayashi M. Yanaka N. Nagasawa T. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9000-9007Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, efficient misincorporation by the appropriate misincorporator tRNA construct is required to restore the function of Cys165 mutants. For our studies, Cys165 was mutated to histidine or serine and co-transformed into E. coli with mutant misincorporator libraries. The variants were isolated from the library based on an increased growth rate in amine-free, acetamide-containing medium. By direct biochemical measurement, some of these variants exhibit significantly higher levels of misincorporation (Fig.6 and Table I). Isolation of mutants that efficiently misincorporate cysteine for serine and histidine residues suggests that it will be possible to select efficient misincorporator constructs for all 19 amino acids. Although it is convenient to analyze MPAX data by SDS-PAGE, the gel read-out requires that the protein of interest be devoid of native cysteine residues. A native cysteine residue is present in 100% of the protein molecules and will always be cleaved by NTCB. Thus, only misincorporated cysteines located between the radioactive end label and the closest native cysteine residue are expected to produce observable cleavage bands. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a mass spectrometry method to measure the rate of alkylation at misincorporated cysteines. Our approach is based on a pulse-chase experiment that uses two ICAT reagents, N-iodoacetyl, p-chlorobenzyl-12C6-glucamine (12C-ICAT) and N-iodoacetyl, p-chlorobenzyl-13C6-glucamine (13C-ICAT). Except for the difference in nuclear isotope composition, the two compounds are chemically identical. The protein is incubated for a variable time under native conditions with13C-ICAT, followed by incubation under denaturing conditions with an excess of 12C-ICAT (Fig.7a). Solvent-exposed cysteines are modified completely by 13C-ICAT during the initial pulse, whereas buried cysteines are only alkylated with12C-ICAT upon unfolding of the protein in the chase step. After alkylation, the protein is fragmented by proteolysis, and peptides containing alkylated cysteine residues are purified by boronate affinity chromatography. This affinity step takes advantage of the fact that the vicinal diols present in the glucose moiety of the ICAT reagent bind to immobilized boronate groups (25Liu X.C. Scouten W.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 147 (119–128): 886-888Google Scholar). The purified peptides are separated by reverse-phase chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Each peptide is identified by its absolute mass and by its mass fragmentation pattern. The13C-ICAT:12C-ICAT isotope ratio reports the fractional alkylation of the peptide during the initial alkylation pulse (Fig. 7, b–d). Thus, the mass isotope ratios for cysteine-containing peptides provide a quantitative and site-specific measure of alkylation rates in the folded protein. We demonstrate the use of the ICAT approach in measuring protection factors of misincorporated cysteines in the wild-type (cysteine-containing) TIM protein. Protection factors determined by mass spectrometry are in excellent agreement with those determined by gel methods (Fig. 7f). Mass spectrometry provides a high throughput read-out that does not require the removal of native cysteines from the protein. The ICAT detection method and the modular design of the misincorporation plasmids are well suited for proteome-wide studies. We present a novel technique, MPAX, for the study of protein structure at single amino acid resolution. First, using cysteine tRNAs mutated at the anti-codon triplet, we show that we can biosynthetically misincorporate cysteine at specific amino acid sites in a bacterially expressed protein. Second, we use the pool of cysteine-misincorporated protein to map binding sites on the protein for ligands withKd values ranging from millimolar (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate binding to the TIM active site) to nanomolar (a polyclonal antibody binding to its epitope). For cysteine probes whose alkylation is completely blocked by ligand binding, probe protection increases by a factor of 1 + [ligand]/Kd in the presence of the ligand relative to its absence. Thus, in principle, MPAX could be used to determine Kd values for ligands. Third, we identify amino acids on the protein surface and buried in the protein structure using MPAX data. This type of information should be useful in predicting the structures of novel proteins. Fourth, we demonstrate that MPAX can be used to measure the protein stability of TIM under conditions that favor the native state. TIM does not reversibly unfold and refold under the conditions conventionally used for stability measurements. Our data suggest that MPAX will be useful for making stability measurements on other large proteins that do not exhibit reversible refolding reactions. Fifth, we show that efficient misincorporation can be achieved at new codons by application of a simple bacterial selection scheme. Thus, it should be possible to apply the MPAX technique to all 20 amino acids. Finally, we demonstrate that MPAX data can be collected for proteins that contain native cysteine residues by using a pulse-chase experiment with an isotope-coded affinity tag detected by mass spectrometry. This approach should be useful for proteomics work. A concern regarding the use of misincorporated cysteines as a probe of protein structure is that a cysteine mutation itself could disrupt the native conformation. This concern is mitigated by the fact that the cysteine side chain is small and amphiphilic and thus a good substitute for many amino acids. To address the question directly, we measured the effects on in vivo folding caused by cysteine replacements at the isoleucine, leucine, and valine residues of triosephosphate isomerase. TIM was expressed in the presence of misincorporator tRNAs and was purified from both soluble and inclusion body fractions of E. coli. The level of misincorporation at each position was measured by NTCB cleavage. The cleavage intensity of each residue in the two protein preparations was found to differ by no more than 5-fold at any position (data not shown). None of the cysteine mutations causes a significant partitioning of triosephosphate isomerase into inclusion bodies in vivo, hence cysteine mutations at these positions do not appear to interfere substantially with folding. If a cysteine mutation at a buried position did disrupt the protein structure, the residue would likely be incorrectly classified as solvent-exposed. This type of disruption is not observed to occur in the TIM mutants that we studied. All of the residues show protection factors consistent with their solvent accessibility (Fig. 5, b and c). Alternatively, cysteine substitution in a binding interface could interfere with binding. This would produce a false negative result in a protection experiment, because no protection of the misincorporated cysteine would be observed upon addition of the binding partner. Again, this phenomenon is not observed in the TIM mutants we studied. All isoleucine, leucine, and valine residues involved in the binding sites of both a small molecule and an antibody are identified correctly (Figs. 3b and 4). Disruption of a binding interface should never produce a false positive result. MPAX is complementary to structural techniques such as x-ray crystallography and multi-dimensional NMR, because it can provide information on the dynamical behavior of proteins in complex solutions. Clearly, prior knowledge of the protein structure greatly facilitates the interpretation of MPAX data. MPAX is closely related to the amide proton-deuterium exchange technique, and essentially any type of amide proton-deuterium exchange experiment can be adapted to the MPAX format. A disadvantage of MPAX relative to amide proton-deuterium exchange is that cysteine mutations are expected to perturb protein structure to a greater extent than proton-deuteron substitutions. MPAX has the advantage relative to amide proton-deuterium exchange in that it is read out by gel methods or by mass spectrometry rather than by magnetic resonance. Thus, the MPAX technique overcomes the technical challenge of assigning a protein NMR spectrum, the requirement for specialized equipment, and the protein size limitations inherent to magnetic resonance. Finally, a number of analytical techniques are based on introduction of single cysteine substitutions into a protein by site-directed mutagenesis. Most of these approaches can be accomplished in the MPAX format, with the advantage that cysteine misincorporation provides a high throughput means to generate distributed cysteine probes. MPAX can be applied to many types of experiments beyond those demonstrated here. For example, time-resolved measurements of cysteine reactivity can be used to monitor the kinetic progression of biochemical events (see Ref. 26Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar for analysis of E. coliDNA polymerase III processivity clamp assembly by the clamp loader machine and Ref. 27Ha J.H. Loh S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar for studies of apomyoglobin refolding at millisecond resolution). Alkylation of misincorporated cysteinesin vivo would probe protein interactions in their natural environment. Presumably, the technique can be adapted to eukaryotic expression systems known to accommodate suppressor tRNAs (28Laski F.A. Ganguly S. Sharp P.A. RajBhandary U.L. Rubin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the effects of gangliosides on cell spreading and related signaling pathways are unknown. Increases in gangliosides GT1b and GD3 inhibited spreading on fibronectin, concurrent with inhibition of Src and focal adhesion kinase. Although antibody blockade of GT1b or GD3 function and gene-modulated ganglioside depletion stimulated spreading and activated Src and focal adhesion kinase, the augmented spreading by disruption of GT1b function, but not by disruption of GD3 function, was inhibited by blockade of Src and focal adhesion kinase activation. In contrast, inhibitors of protein kinase C prevented the stimulation of spreading by GD3 functional inhibition, but not by GT1b functional blockade. Modulation of either GT1b or GD3 content affected phosphoinositol 3-kinase activation, and inhibition of this activation reversed the stimulation of cell spreading by anti-GD3 antibody, anti-GT1b antibody, and ganglioside depletion, suggesting that phosphoinositol 3-kinase is an intermediate in both the FAK/Src and protein kinase C pathways that lead to cell spreading. These studies demonstrate that epithelial cell ganglioside GT1b modulates cell spreading through alpha(5)beta(1)/FAK and phosphoinositol 3-kinase signaling, whereas GD3-modulated spreading appears to involve phosphoinositol 3-kinase-dependent protein kinase C signaling."

DNA replication starts at specific sites on chromosomes referred to as origins of DNA replication. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins recognize the origins of replication and facilitate local unwinding of duplex DNA. Once single-stranded DNA has been exposed the remaining replication proteins may assemble into a multienzyme complex frequently referred to as the replisome (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA replication Second Edition. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992Google Scholar). It is likely that the origins of DNA replication have structural features that contribute to the efficiency and regulation of initiation of DNA replication during one or both of these steps. Initiation of Herpes simplex virus DNA replication depends on two largely homologous origins of replication in the viral genome: oriL and oriS (2Stow N.D. McMonagle E.C.

Box I and box III are part of an evolutionarily conserved palindrome that forms a stable hairpin in single-stranded DNA. Box I and box II are separated by an AT-rich spacer sequence that varies in length and nucleotide composition between different α herpes viruses. In oriS from HSV-1 box I, box II and the AT-rich sequence form a 46-bp palindrome. Genetic analyses have demonstrated that the boxes I, II, and III as well as their precise arrangement in oriS affect the efficiency of origin-dependent DNA replication in vivo(5Aslani A. Macao B.

The C-terminal part of the protein, below referred to as ΔOBP, binds the sequence GTTCGCAC through interactions in the major groove of DNA (15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol.

It has been shown that single-stranded DNA efficiently disrupts the complex between OBP and ICP8 (20Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol.

We also show that OBP and ICP8 together support specific unwinding of minimal oriS dependent on ATP. A model for the activation of HSV-1 oriS is presented. It suggests that the DNA sequence of the origin of replication directs the folding of DNA into a stable structure specifically bound by the initiator protein and that this complex may serve as an assembly site for the replisome. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. ATP, ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Oligonucleotides were from DNA Technology A/S, Denmark. Unless otherwise stated they were 80 nucleotides long. The upper strands were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. They were used either as single-stranded oligonucleotides or to make double-stranded DNA. Complementary strands were annealed in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8 and 0.1m NaCl. In the experiments described below oriS consists of double-stranded DNA, and oriS* is made up of a single-stranded 80-mer corresponding to the upper strand of oriS as shown in Fig. 1.

T65 is a 65-mer of oligodeoxythymidylate. OBP and ICP8 were purified from Sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus vectors as described (19Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Google Scholar). The proteins were ∼95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Ultra pure agarose was purchased from Invitrogen. Reaction mixtures, 10 μl, with 0.2 nmradiolabeled oriS or oriS* in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm NaCl were supplemented with 40 nm OBP and 50 nm ICP8 as indicated. The reaction mixtures also contained 2.5 mm ATP or ATPγS, ADP, and AMP-PNP as indicated. Samples were incubated at 37 °C. The reactions were analyzed on 0.9% agarose gels in a buffer containing 40 mmTris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Submarine gels were run for 90 min at room temperature and a field strength of 7 V/cm. The gels were dried onto DE81 paper, Whatman, and they were either autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C or subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. Exonuclease I at a concentration of 10 units/μl was from Amersham Biosciences. Single-stranded 80-mer oriS(wt) was radiolabelled at the 5′end. Double-stranded oriS(wt) was produced by annealing complementary strands as described above. In the 40-μl reaction mixtures 0.8 nm of single-stranded oriS(wt), oriS*, or double-stranded oriS(wt), oriS, were incubated with 0.16 μm OBP and 0.2 μm ICP8 in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2,5 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm ATP as indicated. Incubation was for 90 min at 37 °C to allow formation of OBP-oriS* complexes from double-stranded DNA. To remove ICP8 from the protein-DNA complexes 2 μl of T65 was added. After an incubation for 1 min in 37 °C 1 μl of exonuclease I, 10 units, was added as indicated, and the incubation was allowed to proceed for another 15 min at 37 °C. The samples were extracted by phenol, and DNA was precipitated by ethanol. DNA was dissolved in 5 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8. 0.5 μl of formamide loading buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Electrophoresis was for 2 h at 600 V. The dried gels were analyzed using a phosphorimager. Single-stranded radiolabeled 44-, 54-, and 63-mer oligonucleotides corresponding to the upper strand of oriS were used as markers. Metaphor® agarose was from BioWhittaker Molecular Applications. The reaction mixture was as described above. Double-stranded DNA radiolabeled at the upper strand was produced as described above. The incubation was carried out at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 60 min by addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to a final concentration of 0.1%. Samples were analyzed on 3% Metaphor agarose gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was for 2 h at room temperature at 100 V. The gels were then dried onto DE81 paper, Whatman, and they were either autoradiographed overnight at −80 °C or subjected to phosphorimager analysis. OBP forms a specific and stable complex with either heat-treated double-stranded oriS or single-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the upper strand of oriS (Fig.1 A) (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar). The novel conformation of oriS recognized by OBP is referred to as oriS*. OriS* consists of stable hairpin formed by complementary base pairing between box I and box III (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar). The 3′-part of oriS* is made up of the AT-rich spacer sequence, and it may also adopt a hairpin conformation (Fig.1 B). A secondary structure prediction using the mfold program, however, suggests that it is an unstable hairpin that easily may become single-stranded as temperature is increased from 37 to 45 °C (Fig. 1 C) (21SantaLucia Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1460-1465Google Scholar, 22GCG Wisconsin Package Version 10.1. Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI2000Google Scholar, 23Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a mutant version of oriS referred to as oriS(-6AT) leads to reduced ability to form an OBP-oriS* complex (10Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Google Scholar, 12Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Google Scholar). A secondary structure prediction using mfold indicates that the putative AT-rich hairpin becomes more stable in this mutant (results not shown). We have also seen that OBP forms a complex with single-stranded DNA containing a boxI/boxIII hairpin and a 3′ single-stranded tail (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar). This DNA ligand not only supports the formation of a stable complex with OBP, but it also greatly stimulates ATP hydrolysis by OBP (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that oriS* exists as a hairpin with a single-stranded tail when bound by OBP. We have now searched for conditions that would allow an 80-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing minimal oriS to be converted to single-stranded oriS* by OBP. The short version of oriS was formed by annealing of two 80-mer complementary DNA strands. The single-strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 and ATP were together with OBP included in the reaction mixture. The production of oriS* was monitored by the appearance of a complex between OBP and oriS* detected by agarose gel electrophoresis under native conditions. The results were initially difficult to interpret because ICP8 will form a stable and specific complex with the C terminus of OBP (19Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Google Scholar). This complex can, however, be efficiently disrupted by single-stranded DNA (20Gustafsson C.M. Falkenberg M. Simonsson S. Valadi H. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19028-19034Google Scholar). In the gel retardation experiments described below we have therefore added a 65-mer of oligodeoxythymidylate, T65, to the reaction mixture immediately prior to analysis of protein-DNA complexes by agarose gel electrophoresis. In this way we can distinguish between the OBP-oriS* complex and the ternary complex formed between OBP, ICP8, and oriS*. We first examined the requirements for the formation of an OBP-oriS* complex from double-stranded minimal oriS (Fig.2). Incubation of OBP, ICP8, and ATP with double-stranded minimal oriS was carried out for 60 min at 37 °C. T65 was then added as indicated to the reaction mixtures before gel electrophoresis. We found that incubation of double-stranded minimal oriS with OBP and ATP produced two complexes referred to as complex I and complex II (Fig. 2, lane 5). These complexes have been previously characterized (10Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Google Scholar). Complex I represents OBP bound to box I, whereas complex II represents OBP cooperatively bound to boxes I and II. The addition of T65 did not significantly affect the formation of complexes I and II (Fig. 2,lane 6). ICP8 did not bind double-stranded oriS (Fig. 2,lanes 7 and 8). Simultaneous incubation of OBP, ICP8, and ATP resulted in the formation of complexes, which migrated slower than complex II in agarose gels (Fig. 2, lane 9). Strikingly, addition of T65 reduced the amount of slowly migrating complexes and produced a unique complex with an electrophoretic mobility similar to the OBP-oriS* complex (Fig. 2, lanes 2and 10). A separate experiment was performed in order to further examine the electrophoretic properties of the putative OBP-oriS* complex (Fig.3). In the sample analyzed in the first lane OBP was mixed with a single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the upper strand of minimal oriS prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. In the sample analyzed in the second lane OBP, ICP8, and ATP was first incubated with double-stranded minimal oriS(wt). Competing T65 was then added prior to agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was subjected to phosphorimager analysis. The results show that the two complexes have identical electrophoretic mobilities. To further authenticate the OBP-oriS* complex produced from double-stranded oriS an exonuclease I footprinting assay was developed. Exonuclease I is a 3′-5′ processive single-strand specific exonuclease. The single-stranded oriS(wt) 80-mer oligonucleotide oriS* will be completely degraded by exonuclease I without significant pause sites. In contrast double-stranded oriS(wt) is completely resistant to exonuclease I (results not shown). In the presence of OBP and ICP8, however, two prominent pause sites are detected during the digestion of oriS* (Fig. 4). The first pause site corresponds approximately to a 54-mer, whereas the second pause site corresponds to 38- and 39-mers. The addition of T65, which disrupts the interaction between OBP and ICP8, does not affect the location of the pause sites (Fig. 4). When double-stranded oriS is examined we find that incubation with OBP, ICP8, and ATP prior to exonuclease allows detection of the very same pause sites. Addition of T65 does not affect the location of the pause sites. Importantly, in the absence of ATP double-stranded oriS is completely resistant to exonuclease I, and no pause sites are detected (Fig. 4). The results argue that OBP, in the presence of ICP8 and ATP, is able to form an OBP-oriS* complex from double-stranded oriS. It also indicates that the helicase domains of OBP may cover between 4 and 20 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA extending from the box I/box III hairpin toward the 3′-end. We have also analyzed the effect of mutations in oriS on the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex (Fig.5). Box III is of special interest. It does not interact with OBP in double-stranded oriS in a sequence-specific manner, but it is essential for the formation of oriS* through complementary base-pairing with box I (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar, 15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Google Scholar). The results again show that double-stranded minimal oriS(wt) can be converted to an OBP-oriS* complex in the presence of ICP8 and ATP (Fig.5, a and b, lane 4). In contrast, a mutant version of minimal oriS, oriS(-box III), fails to support the formation of an OBP-oriS* complex. In this case, the addition of competing T65 to a reaction mixture containing OBP, ICP8, and ATP results in reappearance of complexes I and II (Fig. 5, a andb, lane 8). It should also be noted that a complex between OBP and a single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the upper strand of oriS(-box III) is formed with a reduced efficiency when compared with the OBP-oriS* complex, and it has a different electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5, a andb, lanes 1 and 5). These properties probably reflect a DNA conformation characterized by complementary base pairing between boxes I and II as previously discussed (12Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Google Scholar). The role of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis was investigated in a similar set of experiments. We found that ADP, ATPγS, and AMP-PNP did not support the formation of a complex migrating as an OBP-oriS* complex in agarose gels (Fig. 6). In contrast, when ATP was present in the reaction mixture we found that slowly migrating complexes were produced and that these complexes were disrupted by T65 and replaced by an OBP-oriS* complex (Fig. 6,lanes 5 and 6). We also noted that in the presence of ADP complexes accumulated in the wells (lanes 3and 4). The DNA retained in the wells is not single-stranded since the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate will only release duplex DNA (results not shown, see also Fig. 9 b below). The aggregation of OBP-DNA complexes presumably reflects a conformational difference between the OBP-ATP complex and the OBP-ADP complex. Previous studies have also shown the specific OBP-DNA complexes formed in the absence of the nucleotide cofactor may aggregate but complexes formed in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates readily enter the gel (10Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Google Scholar, 24Elias P. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2959-2963Google Scholar).Figure 9Unwinding of minimal oriS requires OBP , ICP8 , and ATP. a, an autoradiograph of a Metaphore agarose gel showing unwinding of double-stranded minimal oriS, dsDNA. Reaction mixtures are described under “Experimental Procedures.” They all contain 2.5 mm ATP. OBP and ICP8 were added as indicated. b, ATP-dependent unwinding of oriS. Reaction mixtures as described under “Experimental Procedures” were supplemented with nucleotides as indicated. Samples were analyzed on Metaphor agarose gels described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The time course for the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex was also examined. We noted that incubation for 30 min or more at 37 °C was required in order to produce significant amounts of the OBP-oriS* complex from duplex DNA (Fig. 7). These results argue that OBP together with ICP8 can convert double-stranded DNA containing minimal oriS to an activated form in a reaction dependent on hydrolysis of ATP. Activated minimal oriS can be isolated in complex with OBP and ICP8. When these complexes are exposed to single-stranded DNA ICP8 dissociates, but OBP remains bound to activated minimal oriS. The complex between OBP and activated minimal oriS has an electrophoretic mobility identical to the previously characterized OBP-oriS* complex. These complexes also present the same exonuclease I digestion patterns. Both complexes also depend on an intact version of box III. Since box III is involved in complementary base-pairing with box I in oriS* we suggest that this base-pairing scheme also occurs in the activated form of minimal oriS produced by OBP, ICP8, and ATP. Together these observations suggest that the OBP-oriS* complexes formed from single-stranded oriS* and double-stranded DNA oriS have the same composition and structure. It remains to be determined whether the OBP-oriS* complex is a product of an unwinding reaction or an intermediate formed during the process leading to complete strand separation. Several attempts have been made to demonstrate that OBP can specifically unwind oriS containing double-stranded DNA. A study using electron microscopy has successfully demonstrated this phenomenon (25Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1742-1750Google Scholar). In contrast, biochemical studies of OBP-dependent unwinding of oriS have been less successful (26He X. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5726-5728Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that OBP can catalyze complete unwinding of a short version of oriS provided that the AT-rich spacer sequence existed in a preformed single-stranded conformation (26He X. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5726-5728Google Scholar). The unwinding of fully double-stranded oriS was, however, much less efficient. Encouraged by our observation that an OBP-oriS* complex could be formed from double-stranded minimal oriS we looked for experimental conditions that would facilitate analysis of unwinding of minimal oriS. It was essential to identify experimental conditions that allowed complete separation of single-stranded oriS* and double-stranded oriS. We found that this could be acheived in gels containing 3% Metaphor agarose (Fig. 8). Using experimental conditions that favor the formation of an OBP-oriS* complex we could now demonstrate complete unwinding of an 80-bp minimal oriS duplex (Fig. 8 a). Approximately 30% of double-stranded minimal oriS was converted to single strands (Fig. 8 b). The reaction required OBP and ICP8, and it only occurred in the presence of hydrolysable ATP (Fig. 9, aand b). Sequence requirements for initiation of DNA replication are complex. Studies of HSV-1 oriS have indicated that box I and box II are required for cooperative binding of OBP to duplex DNA (15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Google Scholar, 16Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. Naylor A.M. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24621-24626Google Scholar, 17Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Google Scholar, 27Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Google Scholar). In addition the distance and sequence between box I and box II must be correct (10Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Google Scholar). Finally, box III is needed for complementary intrastrand base pairing with box I (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar). We have now surveyed the effects of a selected set of oriS mutations on OBP-dependent unwinding. We first compared unwinding of an 80-bp duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to wild type minimal oriS, oriS(wt), with either an 80-bp duplex oligonucleotide with the same nucleotide composition as oriS but with a scrambled nucleotide sequence, oriS(Scrambled), or an 80-bp minimal oriS duplex with mutations in box I, oriS(-BoxI). The results show that the scrambled duplex was a poor substrate for OBP-dependent unwinding. We estimate that less than 4% of total DNA became single-stranded during the incubation period (Fig. 10). The unwinding of the box I mutant was reduced but not abolished. Approximately 12% of total DNA was retrieved as single strands (Fig.10). Cooperative binding of OBP to the box I mutant presumably accounts for the fact that some unwinding albeit reduced was observed in this instance (15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Google Scholar, 17Hazuda D.J. Perry H.C. McClements W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14309-14315Google Scholar, 27Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Stow N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17424-17429Google Scholar). To explore the connection between unwinding and the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex we examined oriS with mutations either in box I, oriS(-Box I), or box III, oriS(-Box III). These mutations severely reduce formation of the OBP-oriS* complex (12Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Google Scholar). In addition, a double mutant that restores complementary base pairing between boxes I and III, oriS(-boxI,III), was used. We found that unwinding of the mutant versions of oriS was reduced compared with the wild type sequence, oriS(wt) (Fig. 11). It is interesting to note, however, that double mutations in box I and box III did not have an additive effect (Fig. 11). This observation correlates with observations on the behavior of the double mutant in transient replication experiments. In this instance an oriS-containing plasmid with mutations in box I replicated as efficiently as a plasmid with a box I/box III double mutant (9Hernandez T.R. Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. Gustafsson C. Elias P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1649-1652Google Scholar). Our results argue that there is a good correlation between the formation of the OBP-oriS* complex and unwinding of double-stranded minimal oriS. We also wanted to examine if the length of double-stranded DNA would affect the efficiency of OBP-dependent unwinding of oriS. A longer oriS containing duplex, oriS(136-mer), was studied (Fig. 11). We found that unwinding of oriS(136-mer) was much less efficient than unwinding of oriS(wt). This observation might indicate either that unwinding by OBP and ICP8 alone is restricted in vivo to minimal oriS or that long DNA substrates favor reannealing of complementary strands in vitro. The results presented here demonstrate that the Herpes simplex virus type I initiator protein OBP collaborates with the single-strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 to promote ATP-dependent activation of HSV-1 oriS. Both OBP and ICP8 are needed to form the OBP-oriS* complex as well as to carry out complete unwinding of an 80-bp duplex minimal oriS. Below we will address the conformational changes that double-stranded oriS will undergo during this process. We will also discuss the role of ICP8 during initiation of DNA replication. Finally, a comparison will be made between OBP and structurally related DNA helicases that have different biological roles but may share important mechanistic properties with OBP. Binding of initiator proteins to cognate origins of DNA replication leads to the induction of substantial conformational changes in DNA. In most instances enzymatic or chemical probes have been used to detect new conformations. The conformations of the activated origins of DNA replication remain poorly characterized from a structural point of view. One example could be mentioned. Binding of SV-40 T-antigen to its origin of replication starts with sequence-specific recognition of inverted repeats containing the pentanucleotide 5′-GAGGC-3′, and it is accompanied by structural changes in the early palindrome and the AT-rich sequence surrounding the central palindrome (28Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Bullock P.A. Hurwitz J. Cell. 1990; 60: 181-184Google Scholar). Ultimately double hexamers of T-antigen assemble at the origin and encircle the DNA strands. The precise nature of conformational changes the DNA molecule undergoes during this process is not known. The activation of the HSV-1 origin of replication oriS seems to follow a related pathway. Initially the origin-binding protein binds cooperatively to two binding sites in duplex DNA (10Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. Falkenberg M. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4629-4633Google Scholar,15Elias P. Gustafsson C.M. Hammarsten O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17167-17173Google Scholar). In the presence of the single-strand DNA-binding protein ICP8 duplex DNA is destabilized as determined by an increased hyperchromicity and sensitivity to the single-strand-specific endonuclease P1 (29He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Google Scholar). The reaction appears to be ATP-independent. The DNA substrate used in these studies was, however, lacking the box III region of oriS, and the two strands do not appear to become fully separated. We now show that OBP and ICP8 in the presence of a DNA substrate-containing box III is able to completely unwind double-stranded minimal oriS in an ATP-dependent manner. Unwinding of double-stranded oriS leads to the formation of a stable DNA structure, oriS*, consisting of a boxI/boxIII hairpin followed by a single-stranded tail comprising the AT-rich spacer sequence. OBP and oriS* forms a stable complex, and oriS* is a very efficient activator of hydrolysis of ATP by OBP (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar, 12Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Google Scholar). Unwinding of oriS and formation of the OBP-oriS* complex are dependent on intact box I as well as box III sequences. Our observations suggest that origins of replication contain not only DNA sequences that are easily unwound, but they may also contain sequences that allow formation of stable DNA structures that can be recognized by the initiator protein or other components of the replication machinery. ICP8 appears to be required for initiation of DNA replication as well as elongation since a mutant version of OBP that lacks the sequences at the C terminus required for binding to ICP8 is deficient in DNA synthesis as measured in transient replications experiments using expression plasmids encoding the seven HSV-1 replication proteins (30Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Google Scholar). ICP8 may act solely by affecting properties of the initiator protein through a specific interaction with the C terminus of OBP (19Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8444-8448Google Scholar, 30Boehmer P.E. Craigie M.C. Stow N.D. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29329-29334Google Scholar). It is also possible that ICP8 will bind to single-stranded regions of oriS exposed during the process of initiation and prevent reannealing of complementary strands. There is some genetic evidence that ICP8 may participate in two separate reactions. The HSV-1 mutants TL4 and TL5, which map in the N terminus of ICP8 appears to fully complement the HSV-1 mutant n11SV in which 28 amino acids at the very C terminus have been replaced by the SV40 nuclear localization signal (31Gao M. Bouchey J. Curtin K. Knipe D.M. Virology. 1988; 163: 319-329Google Scholar). A distinct role for the C terminus of ICP8 is also indicated by the fact that the mutant dl105 with a deletion mapping at the C terminus acts in a dominant-negative way and inhibits viral DNA replication (32Chen Y.M. Knipe D.M. Virology. 1996; 221: 281-290Google Scholar). Together these observations argue that ICP8 has at least two distinct roles. Perhaps the binding of ICP8 to single-stranded DNA at the replication fork and binding of ICP8 to OBP during initiation of DNA replication are differentially affected in the aforementioned mutants. The crystal structure analyses of the DNA helicases Rep and PcrA have highlighted universal structural features characterizing DNA and RNA helicases (14Subramanya H.S. Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Wigley D.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 379-383Google Scholar, 33Korolev S. Hsieh J. Gauss G.H. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Cell. 1997; 90: 635-647Google Scholar, 34Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 75-84Google Scholar). The RecA-like domains 1A and 2A provide the scaffold for the conserved helicase motifs involved in binding and hydrolysis of ATP. It is more difficult to pinpoint specific roles for the remaining domains. It appears, however, that these enzymes have composite DNA binding sites that target the enzymes to appropriate DNA structures. In the case of OBP, sequence-specific binding to duplex DNA by the C-terminal domain is accompanied by recognition of a 3′-single-stranded tail by the N-terminal helicase domains (5Aslani A. Macao B. Simonsson S. Elias P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7194-7199Google Scholar). Both of these interactions have to be established in order to efficiently trigger hydrolysis of ATP. In a similar way PriA appears to recognize a specific DNA structure at the same time as it binds a 3′-single-stranded tail (35Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Google Scholar). Interestingly, binding of DNA is highly dependent on the length of the tail. The K D for binding duplex DNA is decreased ∼200-fold when the tail length is increased from 8 to 12 nucleotides (35Nurse P. Liu J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25026-25032Google Scholar). A complementary observation was made for OBP. The hydrolysis of ATP is dramatically stimulated when the tail length is altered from 7 to 10 nucleotides (12Aslani A. Simonsson S. Elias P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5880-5887Google Scholar). The exonuclease I digestion experiments presented here indicate that the helicase domains of OBP cover between 4 and 20 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA at the 3′-side of the boxI/box III hairpin. These observations are compatible with the crystal structure analysis of the SF2 RNA helicase NS3 from hepatitis virus C. In this instance eight nucleotides of single-stranded deoxyuridylate bind in a groove between the helicase domains and a C-terminal domain (36Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 89-100Google Scholar). We suggest that the OBP-oriS* complex is formed during the activation of HSV-1 oriS and that it might serve as an intermediate during initiation of DNA replication. It could act as an assembly site for the viral replisome. This model could be tested in several ways. For example, does the OBP-oriS* complex specifically interact with helicase-primase and DNA polymerase? It should also be possible to extend the unwinding experiments described above. What DNA sequences affect the efficiency of unwinding of oriS? Can OBP unwind extensive stretches of DNA or is it restricted to act on minimal oriS only? Such studies should facilitate experiments aiming at establishing a reconstituted system for HSV-1 DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2120794269,"Difficulties in preparing cluster ions for spectroscopic studies have limited our understanding of intermolecular forces in charged complexes that are typical of many reactive intermediates. Here, the infrared spectrum of the charge transfer complex [Ar–N 2 ] + , recorded in a supersonic planar plasma with a tunable diode laser spectrometer, is presented. More than 70 adjacent rovibrational transitions were measured near 2272 wave numbers and assigned to the molecular nitrogen stretching fundamental in the 2 Σ + ground state of [Ar–N 2 ] + . The accurate structural parameters that were determined confirm a linear structure and show that the major part of the charge is located at the argon atom. The latter result is surprising and implies a charge switch of the cationic center upon complexation."
https://openalex.org/W2073545060,"The distances between the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-binding sites of tetrameric IP3 receptors were probed using dimers of IP3linked by poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules of differing lengths (1–8 nm). Each of the dimers potently stimulated45Ca2+ release from permeabilized cells expressing predominantly type 1 (SH-SY5Y cells) or type 2 (hepatocytes) IP3 receptors. The shortest dimers, with PEG linkers of an effective length of 1.5 nm or less, were the most potent, being 3–4-fold more potent than IP3. In radioligand binding experiments using cerebellar membranes, the shortest dimers bound with highest affinity, although the longest dimer (8 nm) also bound with almost 4-fold greater affinity than IP3. The affinity of monomeric IP3 with only the PEG attached was 2-fold weaker than IP3, confirming that the increased affinity of the dimers requires the presence of both IP3 motifs. The increased affinity of the long dimer probably results from the linked IP3 molecules binding to sites on different receptors, because the dimer bound with greater affinity than IP3 to cerebellar membranes, where receptors are densely packed, but with the same affinity as IP3 to purified receptors. IP3and the IP3 dimers, irrespective of their length, bound with similar affinity to a monomeric IP3-binding domain of the type 1 IP3 receptor expressed in bacteria. Short dimers therefore bind with increased affinity only when the receptor is tetrameric. We conclude that the four IP3-binding sites of an IP3 receptor may be separated by as little as 1.5 nm and are therefore likely to be placed centrally in this large (25 × 25 nm) structure, consistent with previous work indicating a close association between the central pore and the IP3-binding sites of the IP3 receptor.

The three subtypes of mammalian IP3 receptor are closely related to each other and to the receptors expressed in birds,Xenopus, crayfish, Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans (2Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Google Scholar). For each of these receptors, the functional IP3-gated Ca2+ channel is thought to be a tetramer, which may either be homomeric or, in those species that express more than one receptor subtype, heteromeric (3Joseph S.K. Lin C. Pierson S. Thomas A.P. Maranto A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23310-23315Google Scholar). Although the different subtypes of mammalian IP3 receptor differ in their distribution (2Taylor C.W. Genazzani A.A. Morris S.A. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Google Scholar), differ modestly in their affinity for IP3 and their ability to recognize different inositol phosphates (4Nerou E.P. Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 59-69Google Scholar), and may be differentially modulated (5Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Google Scholar), the physiological significance of this diversity is unclear. More striking than the differences between IP3 receptor subtypes are the similarities: the primary sequences of the subunits are closely related, each assembles to form a tetrameric IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, they recognize similar ligands with broadly similar affinities, and most are biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca2+ (6Swatton J.E. Morris S.A. Cardy T.J.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 55-60Google Scholar).Analyses of the relationships between structure and function have focused primarily on the mammalian type 1 IP3 receptor, but the other subtypes are likely to be similar. Electron microscopy of IP3 receptors in cerebellar Purkinje cells (7Katayama E. Funashashi H. Michikawa T. Shiraishi T. Ikemoto T. Iino M. Hirosawa K. Mikoshiba K.

A. 1990; 87: 2132-2136Google Scholar) structures. Recent evidence suggests that Ca2+ might regulate the transition between these states (8Hamada K. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Google Scholar). In negatively stained images of pure receptors, the sides of the structures are about 25 nm in length (8Hamada K. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Google Scholar, 9Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Google Scholar, 10Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2132-2136Google Scholar), but they appear smaller (about 15 nm) in single particle reconstructions of purified receptors in vitreous ice (11Jiang Q.-X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Google Scholar) and smaller still (about 12 nm) in images of native receptors (7Katayama E. Funashashi H. Michikawa T. Shiraishi T. Ikemoto T. Iino M. Hirosawa K. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4844-4851Google Scholar).The IP3-binding site (one on each subunit of the receptor) lies within the N-terminal between residues 226 and 576 (12Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Google Scholar) and is formed by two structurally distinct domains linked by a region that includes the S1 splice site (13Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Google Scholar). Within this region, conserved lysine and arginine residues are likely to be important for recognition of the phosphate groups of IP3. All four subunits of the tetrameric receptor contribute to the Ca2+ pore, with residues lying close to the C terminus, namely the last two transmembrane regions (TMR-5 and TMR-6) and the intervening loop, forming the Ca2+ channel (14Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Google Scholar). Although the IP3-binding site and the pore of the channel lie at opposite ends of the primary sequence and are separated by almost 1700 residues (the “modulatory domain”), there is evidence of direct contact between them (15Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Google Scholar), with the IP3-binding domain of one subunit perhaps interacting directly with the pore region of an adjacent subunit (16Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Google Scholar). Despite this considerable progress in establishing the structural determinants of IP3 binding and of the pore, the location of the IP3-binding sites within the quaternary structure of the receptor is unknown.A powerful strategy for the identification of potent and selective ligands for receptors with multiple binding sites is the use of multivalent ligands (17Mammen M. Choi S.-K. Whitesides G.M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 2754-2794Google Scholar). Applications of this approach to multi-subunit proteins have generally employed synthetic bivalent constructs in which two molecules of a ligand are linked by a spacer in which the length is customized to span the distance between two binding sites within a protein multimer. Successful examples include the development of selective κ-opioid antagonists such as norbinaltorphine (18Portoghese P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2259-2269Google Scholar), potent muscarinic agonists (19Rajeswaran W.G. Cao Y. Huang X.-P. Wrobelski E. Colclough T. Lee S. Liu P. Nagy P.I. Ellis J. Levine B.A. Nocka K.H. Messer W.S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 4563-4576Google Scholar), and inhibitors for β-tryptase (20Schaschke N. Matschiner G. Zettl F. Marquardt U. Bergner A. Bode W. Sommerhoff C.P. Moroder L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 313-327Google Scholar) and the proteasome (21Loidl G. Groll M. Musiol H.-J. Huber R. Moroder L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5418-5422Google Scholar). Bivalent ligands may show enhanced affinity and selectivity for multimeric proteins, and they can also be used to investigate the separation of ligand-binding sites. In a recent example, potent bivalent ligands for tetrameric cyclic nucleotide-gated channels of photoreceptors and olfactory neurons were identified from a series of synthetic dimers of the natural ligand (cGMP) linked by PEG chains of various lengths (1Kramer R.H. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1998; 395: 710-713Google Scholar). The separation of the binding sites for cGMP in the multimeric channels could then be estimated from the calculated mean separation of the two cGMP molecules in the most active dimers for each type of channel.Because previous work had established that even bulky additions to the axial 2-oxygen of IP3 only slightly decrease affinity for the IP3 receptor (22Hirata M. Yanaga F. Koga T. Ogasawara T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8404-8407Google Scholar), we attached linkers to this position to produce dimers of IP3 (23Riley A.M. Potter B.V.L. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2077174157,"Proteasome-mediated processing of thenfκb2 gene product p100 is a regulated event that generates the NF-κB subunit p52. This event can be induced through p100 phosphorylation by a signaling pathway involving the nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase (NIK). The C-terminal region of p100, which contains its phosphorylation site and a death domain, plays a pivotal role in regulating the processing of p100. To understand the biochemical mechanism of p100 processing, we searched for cellular factors interacting with the C-terminal regulatory region of p100 using the yeast two-hybrid system. This led to the identification of S9, a non-ATPase subunit of the 19 S proteasome with no known functions. Interestingly, the S9/p100 interaction could be induced by NIK but not by a catalytically inactive NIK mutant. This inducible molecular interaction required p100 ubiquitination and was dependent on the intact death domain. We further demonstrated that the death domain is essential for NIK-induced post-translational processing of p100, thus providing a functional link between the S9 binding and the processing of p100.

Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 69: 6910-6924Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Google Scholar, 3Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, this family is composed of five members, RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, that function as homo- and heterodimers (4Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar). The NF-κB dimers are normally sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment as inactive complexes by specific inhibitory molecules that belong to the inhibitor κB (IκB) family. Activation of NF-κB by cytokines and various other cellular stimuli involves phosphorylation and proteolysis of the IκB proteins and the concomitant nuclear translocation of NF-κB factors. This acute activation process is mediated by an IκB kinase (IKK), which is composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). Upon activation by upstream signals, IKK phosphorylates the IκBs at specific serines, which targets these inhibitors for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. In addition to this so-called canonical pathway of activation, NF-κB is subjected to regulation by other mechanisms. These include processing of the NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 precursor proteins p105 and p100, which is required for generating the p50 and p52 NF-κB subunits, respectively (4Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar, 6Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Google Scholar). Because p105 and p100 function as IκB-like molecules, their processing also leads to activation of specific NF-κB members. Recent studies suggest that the processing of p105 and p100 involves different mechanisms (3Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Google Scholar, 7Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). Whereas the processing of p105 is constitutive, the processing of p100 is tightly controlled (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). The lack of constitutive processing of p100 is largely attributable to its C-terminal processing-inhibitory domain, which contains a region known as a death domain (DD). Active processing of p100 can be induced by the NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar), which seems to function through its downstream kinase IKKα (9Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Kraehn G. Greten F. Chen Y., Hu, Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, p100 is recognized by the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase, which catalyzes its polyubiquitination (10Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Google Scholar). This modification serves as an essential trigger for the inducible processing of p100 by the proteasome. The 26 S proteasome complex is composed of two subcomplexes, the 20 S catalytic particle and the 19 S regulatory particle (11Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Google Scholar). The 20 S particle has a cylinder-shaped structure containing four stacked heptameric rings that form the proteolytic chamber. The 20 S cylinder is capped on both sides by a 19 S particle to form the 26 S proteasome. The 19 S particle is composed of at least 17 proteins that form two subcomplexes; the “base” complex is composed of six AAA family of ATPases and three other proteins, and the “lid” complex is composed of eight non-ATPase proteins (12Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the 19 S particle plays two major roles in facilitating protein degradation by the 20 S particle. The first is to recognize and position ubiquitinated protein substrates, and the second is to unfold the protein substrates so that they can be inserted to the proteolytic chamber of the 20 S catalytic particle. How these events occur in the 19 S particle is unclear, and how the individual subunits participate in the regulatory functions also remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that S9, a protein located in the “lid” of the 19 S proteasome (13Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 179-184Google Scholar), specifically interacted with p100. The S9/p100 interaction could be strongly induced by NIK and required p100 ubiquitination. Interestingly, the DD of p100 was essential for S9 binding as well as for NIK-induced post-translational processing of p100. These results provide an important insight into the biochemical mechanisms of p100 processing in the proteasome. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using the MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech). A cDNA fragment encoding the C-terminal region (amino acids 754–900) of p100 was cloned into the pLexA vector downstream of the DNA-binding domain of LexA to generate the pLexA-p100C bait. Initial tests showed that this bait has no self-transactivation activity (data not shown). The pLexA-p100C was used to screen a Jurkat T cell library constructed using pB42AD vector (Human Leukemia MATCHMAKER LexA cDNA library; Clontech) following the manufacturer's instructions. Putative positive clones were retransformed to the yeast strain with either the pLexA-p100C or a nonspecific bait, pLexA-lamin. After this step of false-positive elimination, specific clones were subjected to DNA sequencing and subsequent BLAST search analyses (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Expression vectors encoding NIK and NIK mutant, p100 and derivatives, and HA-ubiquitin have been described previously (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar, 14Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Google Scholar). p100L831P was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to replace leucine 831 of p100 with proline. To construct the HA-tagged S9, full-length human S9 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from Jurkat T cells and inserted into the carrier DNA (pcDNA)-HA vector (15Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Google Scholar). The S9iR is a mutant generated by site-directed mutagenesis that harbors sense mutations in the RNAi targeting site, which prevents the binding and degradation by the specific RNAi. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, 3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antibody recognizing the N terminus of p100 (anti-p100) was kindly provided by Dr. W. C. Greene (16Sun S.-C. Ganchi P.A. Beraud C. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1346-1350Google Scholar). Small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs, double stranded 21-base pair RNA oligonucleotides) specific for human β-TrCP, human S9, and green fluorescent protein were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of the oligonucleotides are: β-TrCP siRNA, GUG GAA UUU GUG GAA CAU CTT (sense) and GAU GUU CCA CAA AUU CCA CTT (antisense); S9 siRNA, GCU GCA GAG CUU GGA GGA CTT (sense) and GUC CUC CAA GCU CUG CAG CTT (antisense); and green fluorescent protein siRNA, GCU ACC UGU UCC AUG GCC ATT (sense) and UGG CCA UGG AAC AGG UAG CTT (antisense). Transfection of 293 cells was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded into six-well plates 12–16 h before transfection. About 60 pmol of siRNA was mixed with 800 ng of pcDNA and transfected into the 293 cells in 2 ml of culturing medium. In some experiments (as indicated in the figure legends), the transfection was repeated at 24 h after the first transfection to achieve high efficiency of gene suppression. 24 h after the RNAi transfection, DNA expression vectors encoding p100 and the other indicated proteins were transfected into the cells. Protein extracts and RNA were prepared at 24–30 h after the DNA transfection. The efficiency of RNAi-mediated gene suppression was monitored by RT-PCR. 293 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (17Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Google Scholar) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (14Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Google Scholar). The cell lysates (about 7 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and IB as described previously (18Uhlik M. Good L. Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Zandi E. Karin M. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21132-21136Google Scholar). CoIP assays (using 250 μg of cell lysates) were performed as described previously (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates with HA-ubiquitin and p100 together with the indicated expression vectors. About 30 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and immediately subjected to IP using anti-p100. The agarose beads were washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and then eluted in SDS loading buffer. The eluted ubiquitin-conjugated p100 was analyzed by IB using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA. 293 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran. At 30 h after transfection, the cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine and then metabolically labeled for 30 min with 350 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine. The pulse-labeled cells were either immediately lysed or chased for 2 h in regular Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10 mm cold methionine and then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for IP analysis. We have previously shown that the C-terminal region of p100 plays a critical role in regulating the processing of p100 (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). To understand the biochemical mechanisms underlying the processing of p100, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens with the C-terminal regulatory region of p100 (amino acids 754–900) fused to the LexA DNA binding domain as bait. We identified five clones encoding different lengths of the same cDNA. BLAST search revealed that this cDNA is identical to a previously cloned gene termed S9 (Fig.1 A). S9 was isolated as a non-ATPase subunit of the 19 S proteasome complex, although its role in protein degradation remained unknown (13Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 179-184Google Scholar). The clones isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening encode the C-terminal portion of S9 covering the conserved PINT (motif in proteasome subunits, Int-6, Nip-1, and TRIP-15) domain. To confirm the interaction of S9 with p100 in mammalian cells, we amplified the full-length human S9 cDNA by RT-PCR from Jurkat leukemia T cell cDNA and cloned it into the pcDNA-HA vector (15Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22911-22914Google Scholar) downstream of the HA tag. When coexpressed with p100 in 293 cells, S9 weakly interacted with p100, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation of these two proteins by the p100-specific antibody (anti-p100) (Fig. 1 B, top, lane 2). Under these conditions, S9 was not precipitated by anti-p100 in the absence of transfected p100 (lane 1), suggesting specificity of the coimmunoprecipitation. We then examined the effect of NIK on the S9/p100 interaction, because this kinase serves as a potent inducer of p100 processing (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). As expected, p100 processing was strongly induced in cells expressing NIK (bottom, lane 3). More importantly, the NIK-induced p100 processing correlated with a marked enhancement of the S9/p100 physical interaction (top, lane 3). The level of S9 protein was comparable in the different cell lysates (middle). These results demonstrate that S9 interacts with p100 in both yeast and mammalian cells and that this molecular interaction can be strongly enhanced by NIK. To further confirm this interaction, we attempted to visualize the binding using endogenous proteins. Because of the lack of an available S9 antibody, we transfected HA-tagged S9 into 293 cells to observe binding with endogenous p100. Because the level of endogenous p100 is low, it is anticipated that the amount of S9 associated with endogenous p100 will also be low. Therefore, about two times more cell lysates were used than in the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B. Interestingly, the anti-p100 antibody could pull down transfected S9, and this interaction was enhanced by NIK (Fig. 1 C,lanes 1 and 2). The S9/p100 interaction was specific; S9 could not be pulled down with a nonspecific preimmune serum (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). The levels of S9 (middle) and p100 (lower) were comparable in the different samples. Thus, S9 interacts with both endogenous and transfected p100, and this binding is enhanced by NIK. To map the domain of p100 involved in S9 binding, we examined the S9-binding activity of various p100 mutants lacking the C-terminal sequences. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid assay, the C-terminal region of p100 seemed to be important for S9 binding, because a p100 mutant (p100-(1–665), see Fig. 2 A) lacking the C-terminal 235 amino acids failed to interact with S9 (Fig.2 B, lane 5). Interestingly, another p100 mutant (p100-(1–859)), which lacks the C-terminal 41 amino acids covering its phosphorylation site (Fig. 2 A), remained competent in S9 binding (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). In fact, this mutant was capable of strong S9 interaction independent of NIK (lane 4 and data not shown). This finding suggests that the sequence located upstream of the phosphorylation site of p100 may serve as an important domain for S9 binding. A visible domain located in this region of interest is the DD. To test the role of the DD in S9 binding, an internal deletion from amino acids 775 to 853 was made to remove the DD from p100. As shown in Fig.3 C, the p100ΔDD was completely inactive in S9 binding in the absence of NIK (lane 3). Furthermore, NIK was unable to induce the binding of this p100 mutant to S9 (lane 4).Figure 3The death domain of p100 is essential for NIK-induced post-translational processing of p100. 293 cells were transfected with NIK (0.25 μg) together with p100 (0.8 μg) or p100ΔDD (0.8 μg). At 30 h after infection, the cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine followed by IP assays to isolate the radiolabeled p100 proteins. Post-translational generation of p52 was detected from the pulse-labeled wild-type p100 (lane 2) but not from the pulse-labeled p100 lacking the death domain (lane 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The DD present in different proteins is about 90 amino acids in length and characterized by the presence of six α-helices that are essential for maintaining the tertiary structure and function of the DD (19Berglund H. Olerenshaw D. Sankar A. Federwisch M. McDonald N.Q. Driscoll P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 171-188Google Scholar, 20Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Google Scholar). To further assess the role of the DD in S9 binding, a proline residue (known to interrupt helix structure) was introduced into the last α-helix of the DD by amino acid substitution. This single amino acid change of leucine 831 to proline (p100L831P) severely affected both the basal and NIK-inducible binding of p100 to S9 (Fig. 2 C,top, lanes 5 and 6). Parallel immunoblotting assays showed that the levels of S9 (middle) and the different p100 constructs (bottom) were similar. These results suggest that the DD of p100 serves as an essential domain for its physical interaction with S9. We have previously shown that the DD of p100 serves as an inhibitory domain for the constitutive processing of p100 (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar); a p100 mutant lacking the DD (p100ΔDD) can undergo constitutive processing. However, the level of this processing is lower compared with that of the NIK-induced p100 processing (Fig. 2 C, bottom,lanes 2 and 3; see also Ref. 8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). Note that the processing of the p100ΔDD, which is incapable of binding to S9, could not be further enhanced by NIK (lane 4). Interestingly, NIK was also unable to induce the processing of the p100L831P mutant (Fig.2 C, bottom, lane 6), which is also defective for the NIK-inducible S9 interaction. This suggested the possibility that constitutive and NIK-inducible processing of p100 occur through different biochemical mechanisms and that S9 may be essential for only the latter. To further explore this possibility, we used an 35S pulse-chase labeling assay, which allows for the specific detection of post-translational processing. Surprisingly, although the p100ΔDD was shown to constitutively generate p52 by immunoblotting assays, the labeling experiment did not reveal a notable precursor/product relationship after a chase of 2 h, even in the presence NIK (Fig.3, lane 4). This result indicates that the processing of p100ΔDD either proceeds with slow kinetics or occurs cotranslationally, as has been demonstrated for the constitutive processing of p105 (21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, mutations in the DD abolish the NIK-inducible post-translational processing of p100, implicating the importance of this domain and interaction with S9 for this biochemical event. Because NIK triggers p100 processing by first inducing its ubiquitination (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar), and because ubiquitin conjugation is a common precursor to proteasome association (12Ciechanover A. Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 442-451Google Scholar), an intriguing possibility is that the ubiquitination of p100 is required for its subsequent binding to S9. To test this idea, we first examined whether the S9/p100 interaction could be enhanced by a catalytically inactive NIK mutant that is incapable of inducing p100 ubiquitination or processing (10Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Google Scholar). As expected, wild-type NIK markedly promoted the S9/p100 interaction (Fig. 4 A,top, lanes 2 and 3), which correlated with the processing of p100 (bottom, lanes 2 and3). In contrast, the NIK mutant was unable to induce the binding of S9 to p100 (top, lanes 4 and5), and this was associated with an inability to induce p100 processing (bottom, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the kinase activity of NIK, and presumably the ubiquitination of p100, is required for the induction of S9/p100 binding. We further confirmed the requirement for p100 ubiquitination using a genetic approach. We have recently shown that NIK-induced p100 polyubiquitination is mediated by the β-TrCP-containing ubiquitin ligase (10Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Google Scholar). Suppression of β-TrCP expression by small inhibitory RNA interference blocks NIK-induced p100 ubiquitination and processing. We used this approach to assess whether the ubiquitination of p100 is required for its physical interaction with S9. For these studies, 293 cells were first transfected with either vector alone or the β-TrCP siRNA to suppress β-TrCP gene expression. To monitor the effect on the polyubiquitination of p100, the cells were then transfected with p100 and an HA-tagged ubiquitin construct, either in the absence or presence of NIK (Fig. 4 C). p100 was isolated by IP, and the ubiquitin-conjugated p100 adducts (migrating as large molecular weight bands) were detected by IB using anti-HA. As expected, β-TrCP gene suppression inhibited NIK-induced p100 ubiquitination (Fig. 4 C, lane 6) and processing (Fig. 4 B, bottom, lane 6). To monitor the effect of β-TrCP gene silencing on S9/p100 binding, we cotransfected the β-TrCP-suppressed cells with p100 and HA-tagged S9, either in the absence or the presence of NIK (Fig.4 B). Interestingly, the NIK-induced S9/p100 physical interaction was almost completely abrogated in the β-TrCP-suppressed cells (Fig. 4 B, upper, lane 6), correlating with the absence of p100 ubiquitination. The levels of S9 were comparable in the different cell lysates (middle). Together, these findings strongly suggest that the S9/p100 binding is facilitated by the polyubiquitination of p100. Although S9 has been identified as a protein associated with the 19 S proteasome complex, the biological function of this protein remains to be defined. The biochemical studies described above argue for a functional connection between S9 and p100 processing. We investigated this possibility using RNAi-mediated gene suppression, a technique that allows for the transient inhibition of specific genes (22Caplen N.J. Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 49-51Google Scholar). Because the S9 antibody is not available, RT-PCR was used to evaluate the efficiency of the RNAi. As shown in Fig.5 A, transfection of an S9-specific siRNA into 293 cells resulted in marked reduction in the level of S9 mRNA. This inhibition was specific; GAPDH RNA levels were unaffected (Fig. 5 A). We also determined the effect of the S9 RNAi on the expression of transfected HA-tagged S9 protein. Consistent with the RNA analysis, the level of HA-S9 protein was greatly reduced in the RNAi-treated cells (Fig. 5 B,lane 2). To further confirm the specificity of this gene suppression approach, we generated a S9 mutant harboring sense mutations at its siRNA binding site. Such mutations do not alter the amino acid codons of S9 but render the S9 mRNA resistant to RNAi-mediated suppression. As expected, the expression of this S9 mutant, termed S9iR, was not affected by the S9-specific RNAi (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). We then examined the effect of S9 gene suppression on NIK-induced p100 processing. As shown in Fig. 5 C, NIK strongly induced the processing of p100 in the untreated cells, resulting in generation of p52 (lane 2). Interestingly, the inducible p100 processing was markedly inhibited when the expression of S9 was suppressed by the RNAi (Fig.5 C, lane 4). To further confirm that the RNAi-mediated inhibition of p100 processing was caused specifically by the lack of S9, we transfected the RNAi-treated cells with the RNAi-resistant form of S9 cDNA (S9iR). As expected, expression of the S9iR efficiently rescued the defect in p100 processing (Fig. 5 C, lane 6). Thus, S9 is required for the NIK-induced processing of p100. Processing of p100 to generate p52 is a tightly regulated event that is stimulated by phosphorylation at the C-terminal region of p100. We have recently demonstrated that the phosphorylated p100 can be recognized by β-TrCP and targeted for rapid ubiquitination (10Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Google Scholar). Although the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination is essential for p100 processing, the subsequent molecular events of p100 processing remain to be investigated. In the present study, we have shown that p100 can be recognized by the S9 protein located in the “lid” of the 19 S proteasome particle. In mammalian cells, the level of this interaction is strongly enhanced after NIK-induced ubiquitination of p100 (Fig. 4). The mechanism by which ubiquitination promotes p100 binding to S9 remains unclear, but one possibility is that the ubiquitination induces conformational changes in p100, resulting in the exposure of an S9-binding domain, the DD. In support of this possibility, removal of the sequences located downstream of the DD of p100 renders this protein capable of strong interaction with S9 even in the absence of NIK (Fig.2 B). Additionally, deletion of the DD or interruption of one of the α-helices in the DD of p100 largely abrogates the ability of p100 to bind S9 (Fig. 2 C). The DD of p100 has been shown to contribute to the inhibition of p100 constitutive processing, because a p100 mutant lacking the DD (p100ΔDD) undergoes constitutive processing (8Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). The data presented in the current study suggests that the DD also plays a role in mediating NIK-induced p100 processing (Fig. 2 C). Interestingly, pulse-chase assays fail to detect a clear product/precursor relationship for the constitutive processing of the p100ΔDD (Fig. 3). This finding suggests two possibilities. First, the constitutive processing of p100 may be mediated by a cotranslational mechanism, as suggested for the constitutive processing of p105 (21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Google Scholar). Second, the kinetics of p100 constitutive processing may be slow compared with NIK-induced processing and thus difficult to detect by pulse-chase analysis. Notwithstanding, our studies suggest that the constitutive and inducible processing of p100 are regulated by different mechanisms. This is clearly demonstrated by the ability of constitutive processing to occur independently of β-TrCP mediated ubiquitination, whereas NIK-inducible processing absolutely depends on the activity of this ubiquitin ligase (10Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Google Scholar). The requirement for the DD in both S9 binding and NIK-inducible p100 processing suggests an important function for the S9/p100 interaction. This notion is further supported by the finding that the S9/p100 binding is induced by NIK and dependent on p100 ubiquitination. In addition, suppression of S9 expression inhibits NIK-mediated p100 processing. Thus, we have demonstrated a unique, direct interaction between p100 and the regulatory particle of the 26 S proteasome that is required for its NIK-inducible processing. How can the DD function to both prevent p100 constitutive processing and support p100 inducible processing? The definitive answer for this question may require structural analysis of the C terminus of p100. One possibility is that the DD is important for proper folding of the C-terminal half of p100, yielding a conformation that prevents direct coupling to the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery, as suggested for its homologue p105 (21Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Google Scholar). Thus, its removal would allow for processing to occur in the absence of any inducers, which is indeed the case. In this scenario, it is tempting to speculate that for the full-length p100, the binding of S9 to the DD may serve to counteract this function, resulting in unfolding of the p100 protein in the 19 S regulatory particle and facilitation of processing by the 20 S proteasome complex. It is of further interest to speculate why p100 requires direct association with a proteasome subunit in addition to the typical ubiquitin signal for its inducible proteolysis. The enhanced level of specificity gained from this additional requirement may be advantageous given the deleterious effects of uncontrolled, constitutive p52 generation. Chromosomal translocations of thenfκb2 gene resulting in loss of the C terminus and constitutive p52 levels have been observed in a number of cases of B- and T-cell lymphomas/leukemias (23Neri A.

Lymphoma. 1996; 23: 43-48Google Scholar). The Tax oncoprotein of the human T-cell leukemia virus, an etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia, is also a potent inducer of p100 processing, and high levels of p52 have been observed in immortalized T cell lines derived from ATL patients (14Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.C. EMBO (Eur. Mol. Biol. Organ.) J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Google Scholar). Thus, tight control of p52 levels with the use of multiple checkpoints may be important for proper regulation of cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W1992774469,"The inhibition of Escherichia coli d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase by l-serine is positively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of ∼2, whereas the binding of the inhibitor, l-serine, to the apoenzyme displays positive cooperativity in the binding of the first two serine molecules and negative cooperativity in the binding of the last two serine molecules. An earlier report demonstrated that the presence of phosphate appeared to lessen the degree of both the positive and negative cooperativity, but the cause of this effect was unknown. This study demonstrates that the presence of intrinsically bound NADH was responsible to a substantial degree for this effect. In addition, this study also provides evidence for negative cooperativity in NADH binding and for at least two NADH-induced conformational forms of the enzyme that bind the inhibitor in the physiological range. Successive binding of NADH to the enzyme resulted in an increase in the affinity for the first inhibitor ligand bound and a lessening of both the positive and negative cooperativity of inhibitor binding as compared with that seen in the absence of NADH. This effect was specific for NADH and was not observed in the presence of NAD+ or the substrate α-ketoglutarate. Conversely, the binding of l-serine did not have a significant effect on the stoichiometry of NADH binding, consistent with it being a V-type allosteric system. Thus, cofactor-related conditions were found in equilibrium binding experiments that significantly altered the cooperativity of inhibitor binding. Since the result of inhibitor binding is a reduction in the catalytic activity, the binding of inhibitor to these NADH-induced conformers must also induce additional conformations that lead to differential inhibition of catalytic activity. The inhibition of Escherichia coli d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase by l-serine is positively cooperative with a Hill coefficient of ∼2, whereas the binding of the inhibitor, l-serine, to the apoenzyme displays positive cooperativity in the binding of the first two serine molecules and negative cooperativity in the binding of the last two serine molecules.

In turn,l-serine inhibits PGDH catalytic activity in an allosteric, cooperative manner (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grant G.A. Schuller D.J. Banaszak L.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PGDH is a homo-tetrameric enzyme that contains four active sites and four l-serine binding sites (4Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The binding of l-serine to PGDH has been studied and shown to exhibit characteristics of both positive and negative cooperativity (5Grant G.A., Xu, X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). l-Serine binds to PGDH at the interface between two adjacent regulatory domains with two molecules ofl-serine binding at each of the two regulatory domain interfaces (4Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Each serine molecule forms hydrogen bonds with adjacent domains forming a hydrogen bond network across the non-covalent interface. This network appears to tether the domains together and results in inhibition of catalytic activity (4Schuller D. Grant G.A. Banaszak L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 6Al-Rabiee R. Zhang Y. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the potential binding of two effector molecules at a single interface could explain the negative cooperativity of ligand binding if a single effector molecule was capable of stabilizing the association of the two domains (5Grant G.A., Xu, X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to the extent that it could exclude, or partially exclude, the binding of the second ligand. l-serine binding was shown to display significant differences in binding behavior in the presence of phosphate (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar). This manifested itself in an alteration of the degree of both the positive and negative cooperativity of serine binding as well as the relative sensitivity of PGDH to serine concentration. This effect seemed to be unique to phosphate among the buffers tested in that several other buffers acted similarly to each other but differently from phosphate. The nature of this “phosphate effect” was unknown at the time, but it was proposed that the phosphate ion might interact at the active site since phosphate groups are part of the natural substrates, 3-phosphoglycerate and NAD+ (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar). It was suggested that linkage between the active sites and the serine binding sites could result in a more open form of the regulatory interface in response to phosphate interaction at the active site, which might then manifest itself in a greater ease of serine binding and a lessening of cooperative effects. If this phosphate effect is the result of interaction at the active site, it suggests that the natural substrates of the enzyme, which contain phosphate groups, would also have a measurable effect on the serine binding characteristics. Such reciprocal effects, that is, the binding of ligand at one site affecting the binding of another ligand at a separate site, is not uncommon (8Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar). In fact, this is essentially the basis for K-type regulation in allosteric systems (8Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar). PGDH has been reported to be basically a V-type regulatory system (2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, binding of effector has its major effect on the velocity of the enzyme rather than on substrate binding. In this respect and in light of recent observations (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar), it was of interest to explore the potential significance of this further. Sugimoto and Pizer (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that purified PGDH contained approximately two molecules of intrinsically bound NADH. The amount of NADH bound could be observed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues in the enzyme and the bound NADH (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sugimoto and Pizer (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reported that the fluorescence signal due to bound NADH was affected by the presence of l-serine, but they concluded that serine only altered the fluorescence properties of the enzyme rather than the amount of bound NADH. To further explore the modulation of cooperativity in PGDH, the effect of cofactors and substrates on the l-serine binding characteristics of PGDH were investigated. This report provides evidence that although some effect of phosphate buffer is seen, a major effect on serine binding is the direct influence of the binding of NADH but not of NAD+ or α-ketoglutarate. PGDH was produced and isolated as described previously (9Al-Rabiee R. Lee E.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13013-13017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10Schuller D.J. Fetter C.H. Banaszak L.J. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2645-2648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with PGDH 4C/A, which is a form of the enzyme in which the 4 cysteine residues in each subunit are converted to alanine residues (11Grant G.A. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22389-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). After cell lysis and ammonium sulfate fractionation, the enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on a column of 5′-AMP-Sepharose and eluted with NADH. After elution, the enzyme was dialyzed directly against either 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA or 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA. In some instances, as described below, the NADH was converted to NAD+ by the addition of α-ketoglutarate prior to dialysis. This conversion was monitored by following the fluorescence of the solution at 420 nm as described below. Catalytic activity was monitored by the change in absorbance at 340 nm due to the conversion of NADH to NAD+ at pH 7.5 (12Tobey K.L. Grant G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12179-12183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using α-ketoglutarate as the substrate (13Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Serine binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis in 200-μl dialysis chambers (Sialomed, Inc., Columbia, MD) purchased from the Nest Group (Southborough, MA). Dialysis was performed for 16 h with [3H]l-serine in appropriate concentrations of unlabeled l-serine. Cells were sampled in triplicate, and the average of 10-min counts was used to calculate concentrations of free and bound l-serine. The nominal PGDH concentration was 5–10 μm tetramer in all binding experiments. When indicated, NADH, NAD+, and α-ketoglutarate were present in solution at 100 μm, 100 μm, and 5 mm, respectively. The dissociation constants reported for NADH and NAD+ are 0.05 and 8 μm, respectively (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the K m for α-ketoglutarate is 0.3 mm. Serine binding data were fit to the Adair equation for four binding sites using Kaleidograph (Synergy Software) as described previously (5Grant G.A., Xu, X.L. Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Grant G.A., Hu, Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17844-17850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescence experiments were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. NADH binding was determined under conditions for stoichiometric binding, which is defined as a concentration of the acceptor that is at least 10 times greater than the dissociation constant of the ligand (15Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 31-32Google Scholar). Excitation was performed at 295 nm, and emission was monitored at 420 nm (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was corrected for dilution. As NADH binds to protein, the F420 rises in response to the resonance energy transfer. After the enzyme is saturated with ligand, the remaining increase in F420 is due to free NADH in solution. Extrapolation of the slopes of these two responses gives the moles of NADH bound per moles of tetrameric PGDH at their point of intersection (15Winzor D.J. Sawyer W.H. Quantitative Characterization of Ligand Binding. Wiley-Liss, New York1995: 31-32Google Scholar). When indicated,l-serine was present at a concentration of 200 μm. Fluorescence scans were performed with excitation at 295 nm and emission monitored from 300 to 450 nm. NADH concentration was determined by absorbance at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6.22 × 103 (16Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the fluorescence spectrum of PGDH after isolation from a 5′-AMP-Sepharose affinity column followed by dialysis to remove free NADH. The fluorescence at 420 nm is an indication of the amount of NADH bound to the enzyme. Also shown is the spectrum of PGDH after it has been treated with the substrate α-ketoglutarate. Titration of the sample containing intrinsically bound NADH with additional NADH (Fig.2) produces an increase in the fluorescence at 420 nm, which corresponds to the binding of ∼2 additional NADH per tetramer, which is consistent with there being ∼2 mol of NADH bound/tetramer in the isolated enzyme.Figure 2Fluorescence titration of PGDH containing intrinsically bound NADH. Immediately after purification, PGDH was dialyzed against Tris or phosphate buffer and then titrated with NADH in the same buffer.

After dialysis, samples titrated with NADH (Figs.3 and 4) show that they are capable of binding ∼4 NADH/tetramer. Thus, the NAD+ produced by reaction with α-ketoglutarate either dissociates from the enzyme during dialysis or can be freely displaced by NADH if it is still bound to the enzyme.Figure 4NADH titration of PGDH in the presence or absence of l-serine in Tris buffer. Immediately after purification, PGDH was treated with α-ketoglutarate to convert NADH to NAD+ and then dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA for 18 h. Titrations were performed without added l-serine (●) or in the presence of 200 μml-serine (▪). The y axis is expressed as the fluorescence at 420 nm minus the initial fluorescence before addition of NADH,F-Fo. The x axis is expressed as moles of NADH per moles of protein (tetramer).

Hu Z. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2501-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar). However, this was done without prior removal of intrinsically bound NADH. To explore this further, serine binding was performed with enzyme that was depleted of NADH and dialyzed with phosphate buffer. The binding curves measured in the absence and presence of saturating levels of NADH, NAD+, and α-ketoglutarate are shown in Fig.5. The binding parameters derived from fitting the data to the Adair equation are shown in TableI. Serine binding to PGDH in the presence of saturating NADH reduces both the positive and negative cooperativity of binding as compared with binding in phosphate in the absence of NADH or in the presence of NAD+ or α-ketoglutarate. The binding in phosphate in the presence of NADH from this study is similar to the binding in phosphate reported previously (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar) in that the degree of apparent positive cooperativity is decreased and the binding of the fourth ligand is now measurable. The effect of NADH on serine binding in Tris buffer shows similar behavior in the lessening of positive cooperativity but not the negative cooperativity (Fig. 6).Table Il-Serine binding parametersTris + NADHTris − NADHPhosphate + sat NADHaBinding performed in the presence of saturating NADH.Phosphate + int NADHbBinding performed with intrinsically bound NADH.Phosphate − NADHPhosphate + NAD+Phosphate + α-KGK12.7 ± 0.411.0 ± 0.00061.2 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.77.0 ± 0.0027.8 ± 0.0018.0 ± 0.001K212.1 ± 4.62.4 ± 0.0037.1 ± 2.75.2 ± 2.22.8 ± 0.0052.7 ± 0.0043.1 ± 0.004K32.5 ± 0.892.9 ± 0.00025.0 ± 1.67.2 ± 2.447.6 ± 0.000242.1 ± 0.000280.7 ± 0.0001K4VLcVL, very large, i.e. > 104.VL145 ± 251380 ± 1770VLVLVLX2dFitting statistics,X 2, accumulated deviation between data and calculated curve.

Adair constants are denoted asK i and intrinsic site dissociation constants asK Ki'. Differential effects of NADH levels on the serine binding characteristics of PGDH can also be observed. The Scatchard analyses in Fig. 7 are derived under conditions in which NADH is depleted from the enzyme, when only intrinsically bound NADH remains on the enzyme (after dialysis), or when the enzyme is saturated with NADH. The decrease in the concavity of the Scatchard plots shows that the degree of cooperativity observed progressively decreases as the NADH status progresses from complete absence to saturation. As expected, the derived dissociation constants listed in Table I show a distinct progression from no NADH to saturating NADH. The distribution of each effector-bound species, calculated from the Adair constants presented in Table I for PGDH in the absence and presence of saturating NADH in phosphate buffer, is shown in Fig.8. The nearly 6-fold increase in affinity for the first inhibitor ligand in the presence of NADH significantly enhances the inhibitor occupancy of PGDH at very low serine concentrations. For instance, at 1 μml-serine, the percentage of enzyme with at least one inhibitor ligand bound increases from ∼16 to ∼50% in the presence of NADH. In addition, the species with at least three inhibitor ligands bound is also significantly enhanced in the presence of NADH. At 5 μml-serine, this occupancy increases from about 5 to 27%, and at 10 μml-serine, it increases from 12 to 55%. The population of species with at least two ligands bound is also increased in the presence of NADH but not nearly to the extent as the others. Because of the effect that the presence of NADH has on serine binding, the effect of serine on NADH binding was also investigated. NADH titrations of NADH-depleted PGDH in the presence of saturating levels of l-serine (Figs. 3 and 4) demonstrate that serine has no appreciable effect on the level of NADH binding in either Tris or phosphate buffer. Serine did appear to enhance the fluorescence slightly in phosphate buffer (Fig. 3), but the number of NADH molecules bound was not altered. We reported previously (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar) that phosphate buffer appeared to have a specific effect on the binding of serine to PGDH that was not evident with other buffers such as Tris, imidazole, and borate. The results of the studies reported here show that the presence of bound NADH also exhibits a significant effect on the binding of l-serine. Furthermore, this effect is specific for the reduced cofactor since it is not observed with NAD+. The data in Table I, which were derived from the serine binding curves, show that phosphate buffer alone (phosphate − NADH) may slightly reduce the level of positive cooperativity in the binding of the first two ligands as compared with Tris buffer. However, phosphate alone does not appear to alter the negative cooperativity in the binding of subsequent serine ligands. Serine binding in phosphate buffer in the presence of either NAD+ or α-ketoglutarate produces very similar binding parameters to that of phosphate alone (phosphate − NADH). It is not until NADH is introduced into the solution that a significant increase in the affinity of the first ligand and a decrease in the negative cooperativity are seen. In regard to the latter, the presence of NADH now brings binding of the last ligand into the measurable range, whereas under all other conditions, binding is too weak to measure. Note that this does not happen in Tris buffer in the presence of NADH. This is consistent with the previous report (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar) since no effort was made to remove the bound NADH from the protein used in those studies. Therefore, these results indicate that the phosphate effect reported previously (7Grant, G. A., Xu, X. L., Hu, Z., and Purvis, A. R.Biochemistry 38, 16548–16552.Google Scholar) appears to be due to a combination of effects from the phosphate ion as well as bound NADH. On the other hand, the ability of PGDH to bind NADH does not appear to be affected by the level of l-serine. This is consistent with the early work of Sugimoto and Pizer (1Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2090-2098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who concluded that serine altered the fluorescent properties of the enzyme rather than the amount of NADH bound. It is difficult to assess the physiologic significance of the effect of NADH since comparable binding parameters are not obtainable when the enzyme is actively turning over substrate and cofactor. It is well known, however, that serine inhibits activity in a cooperative manner during catalysis in vitro in either the direction of NADH oxidation or reduction (2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but with a 10-fold higher sensitivity to serine in the direction of NADH oxidation. Physiologically, the reaction catalyzed by PGDH proceeds in the direction of reduction of NAD+, although the equilibrium of the reaction in the test tube lies well in the other direction (2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That the reaction functions as it does physiologically has been attributed to the depletion of the reaction products by the associated metabolism, thus drawing the reaction in the forward direction. This in itself would represent a level of control over the production of l-serine or the intermediate products of the pathway. That serine binding appears to be more positively cooperative in the physiological direction in which the enzyme binds NAD+ as a substrate suggests an additional potential for fine-tuning in the level of control. However, Dubrow and Pizer (17Dubrow R. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1527-1538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have presented pre-steady state kinetic evidence that suggested that PGDH is not in the same conformation in the enzyme-reduced cofactor complex as it is when it is turning over. Although these data show a change in effector binding characteristics in response to cofactor, it is difficult to explain the inhibition characteristics in terms of the effector binding pattern alone. Moreover, additional changes in effector binding may occur when both substrate and cofactor are interacting with the enzyme. Thus, care must be taken when trying to interpret the results of individual ligand binding experiments in the context of an enzyme that is actively turning over, especially when conclusions regarding comparative stoichiometry are made. PGDH has been classified as a V-type enzyme (2Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), meaning that regulation of activity is basically through modulation of the catalytic turnover rate rather than substrate binding, which is the case for K-type enzymes. The present studies are consistent with this conclusion, but somewhat unexpected is the significant effect of cofactor binding on effector binding without a similar effect in the opposite direction. The differential binding of NADH visualized in Fig.7, as well as in Figs. 2 and 3, provides evidence for at least two additional conformational states of the protein. These two additional states correspond to enzyme with intrinsically bound NADH and enzyme under conditions of saturating NADH. This observation has at least two implications. First, the enzyme displays negative cooperativity in the binding of NADH. Two sites in the enzyme bind NADH very tightly since enzyme is purified with two NADH molecules bound/tetramer, which do not dissociate during dialysis. Second, in the presence of additional NADH, the last two sites bind NADH with weaker affinity. This observation is not unprecedented for dehydrogenases which bind NADH as a cofactor. For instance, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (18Conway A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 4011-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) displays increasing dissociation constants for the four sites that range from around 10−11 for the first site to 10−5 for the last site. Consistent with the induced fit theory of Koshland et al.(19Koshland D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar), this study presents evidence for at least three different states that bind inhibitor with affinities in the physiological range that clearly differ in their individual site affinity for the inhibitor. One state exists in the absence of NADH binding, and the latter two are induced by NADH binding. The two induced states manifest themselves most strikingly in an increase in affinity for the first ligand to bind and an increase in the overall degree of ligand binding. In addition, there is a progressive loss of cooperative behavior of effector binding as cofactor occupancy increases. Thus, in addition to the negative cooperativity that cannot be accommodated by the Monod model (8Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6129) Google Scholar), these data are also more consistent with some variation of the Koshland model, which states that the conformation of each subunit changes in turn as it binds ligand. Furthermore, in addition to the multiple states induced by NADH binding, the subsequent binding to these states by the inhibitor, l-serine, must also induce at least one, and probably more, conformational states that lead to inhibition of catalytic activity. Previously, we have shown that mutations in hinge areas between the inhibitor binding domain and the active site can actually uncouple the cooperativity of inhibition from the cooperativity of serine binding (14Grant G.A., Hu, Z. Xu X.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17844-17850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Grant G.A., Xu, X.L. Hu Z.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1078-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). If these mutations literally interrupt the flow of conformational information between these two distant sites because of mutations that hinder movement around these hinges, then one might expect them to also interrupt the effect of NADH on inhibitor binding. However, if the mechanisms for these two phenomena are not the same, then a different outcome would be expected. Investigations are now ongoing to test this hypothesis. In either case, these investigations will provide additional insight into the structural basis for the cooperative allosteric regulation of this enzyme."

In this paper, we present the molecular cloning and characterization of a gene encoding this protein named virus-inducible stress protein (VISP). The VISP was purified partially by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody against the VISP and further purified by the electroelution from a SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was subjected to internal protein sequencing, and the sequence of three peptides was determined. Degenerate oligonucleotides based on the three peptide sequences were used to screen a cDNA library from rhabdovirus-infected CHSE-214 fish cells, and a cDNA of a 2193-bp open reading frame encoding the VISP with 730 amino acid residues (M r = 79.84) was identified. Whereas the nucleotide sequence of VISPshows no similarity with other genes in the GenBankTM, the amino acid sequence of the VISP has similarity with the bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein family 5 (SBP_bac_5) that is proposed to have chaperone activity. Thus, we explored whether the VISP also had chaperone-like activity. Purified recombinant VISP expressed in Escherichia coli promoted the functional folding of α-glucosidase after urea denaturation and also prevented thermal aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase.

Although both mechanisms of stress protein induction during virus infection and the subsequent roles these proteins play during infection remain mostly unknown, some have speculated that the function of chaperone proteins expressed during virus infection is to facilitate the folding and/or assembly of viral proteins.

The function of the chaperone proteins is found to be important for the growth of adenovirus (10Glotzer J.B. Saltik M. Chiocca S. Michou A.I. Moseley P. Cotton M.

We previously reported that a cellular protein named virus-inducible stress protein (VISP) is increased in fish cells by rhabdovirus infection (29Lee J.Y. Cho W.J., Do, J.W. Kim H.J. Park J.W. Park M.A. Sohn S.G. Jeong G. Hah Y.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This protein is induced by various kinds of stresses including heat shock, heavy metal, and virus infection and distributed among various kinds of cells, which suggests that this protein has the characteristics of a stress protein, molecular chaperone. However, the molecular mass and the antigenic characteristics of this protein are different from those of other well known chaperone proteins (1Cho W.J. Cha S.J., Do, J.W. Choi J.Y. Lee J.Y. Jeong C.S. Cho K.J. Choi W.S. Kang H.S. Kim H.D. Park J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, the cDNA of this protein was cloned and analyzed to further define its characteristics. Oligonucleotide primers based on the partial peptide sequences of the purified VISP led to the isolation of a 2.7-kb cDNA. Its conceptual translational product of 730 amino acids shares sequence similarities with the bacterial extracellular solute-binding protein family 5 (SBP_bac_5). Members of SBP_bac_5 are involved in the transport of and chemotaxis toward substrate (30Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Holbrook S.R. Shymala V. Adv. Enzymol. 1992; 65: 1-47PubMed Google Scholar, 31Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence similarities, they fall into at least eight families that generally correlate with the nature of the solute bound. Among them, family 5 proteins are specific for dipeptides and oligopeptides (32Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of SBP_bac_5 are proposed to act in a manner similar to that of molecular chaperones and therefore increase the refolding of unfolded proteins (33Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Matsuzaki M. Kiso Y. Yamamoto I. Satoh T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In line with its likely role as a molecular chaperone, we now show that the recombinant VISP increases the refolding of unfolded proteins and protects proteins against thermal denaturation. Therefore, we propose that the VISP has sequence similarity with SBP_bac_5 and acts as a molecular chaperone that may play a role in virus infection. CHSE-214 cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A Korean isolate of fish rhabdovirus, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), IHNV-PRT (35Park M.A. Sohn S.G. Lee S.D. Jeong S.K. Park J.W. Fryer J.L. Hah Y.C. J.

The cell lysates were prepared by using lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and were preadsorbed with 10 μl of protein G-agarose (50% suspension in lysis buffer) (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 °C. Preadsorbed supernatant (200 μl) was then mixed with 10 μl of monoclonal antibody (mAb) AB7 raised against the VISP (29Lee J.Y. Cho W.J., Do, J.W. Kim H.J. Park J.W. Park M.A. Sohn S.G. Jeong G.

The immunoprecipitates were harvested by centrifugation after incubation with 10 μl of protein G-agarose suspension and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The polypeptides were electrophoresed in a 10% separating gel under reducing conditions. The molecular masses were assessed in comparison with molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). The proteins on acrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the first antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies with goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and then 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma) in an alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 9.8) were used to detect the VISP-specific antibodies. The CHSE-214 cells were harvested 24 h after IHNV-PRT infection. Total nucleic acids were extracted using the guanidium thiocyanate/acid phenol/chloroform method, and mRNA was purified using oligo(dT)30-Latex suspension (Qiagen). The cDNAs were synthesized using a cDNA cloning kit (Stratagene; ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit). The cDNA was ligated into the EcoRI andXhoI site of λ ZAP vector and packaged into phage λ. The resultant phage λ was infected into Escherichia coliXL1-Blue MRF′ strain. E. coli cells were infected according to the manufacturer's instructions and screened by hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe. To identify the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the obtained proteins, the proteins were immunoprecipitated using mAb AB7 and then electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE as described (1Cho W.J. Cha S.J., Do, J.W. Choi J.Y. Lee J.Y. Jeong C.S. Cho K.J. Choi W.S. Kang H.S. Kim H.D. Park J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein band was excised, and the protein was eluted using gel eluter (Hoefer). Two purified samples were submitted for amino acid sequencing. One sample was electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and submitted for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The second sample, ∼20 pmol of the VISP, was subjected to Arg-C digestion, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (36Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 3rd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 10-82-10-86Google Scholar), and then submitted for internal protein sequencing to the BioResource Center at Cornell University. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the amino acid sequence of the three peptides and were synthesized. Then PCR was carried out using as a template cDNA from IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cells (see Table I). Primer sets 5F-7R, 5F-9R, 7F-5R, 7F-9R, 9F-5R, and 9F-7R were utilized for the gene amplification. The gene amplification reaction conditions were as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 5 min; 20 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min with a 0.5 °C decrease each cycle, and 72 °C for 1 min; 20 cycles of 92 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. A unique 186-bp product was isolated from the gene amplification reaction using 9F-5R primer set, cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced using the chain-terminating, dideoxy method. Conceptual translation of the primary sequence verified that this amplified product corresponded to the VISP. The 186-bp product was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random prime reactions (Stratagene) and was used to screen the cDNA library. Positive clones were plaque-purified, and the clone containing the largest insert was chosen for further characterization. The cDNA insert was excised into pBlueScript (Stratagene), and the sequencing was performed at the Basic Science Research Center (Daejon, Korea) on an automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) according to the dye terminator procedure with forward and reverse primers and overlapping primers designed from the sequencing results.Table IAmino acid sequence of internal peptides from the VISP and sequence of degenerate oligonucleotides used in gene amplificationPeptideAmino acid sequenceaAmino acid sequences are listed in the standard single-letter code.

Open table in a new tab To obtain a full-length cDNA sequence, 5′ RACE amplification was carried out by using 5′ RACE kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CHSE-214 cells were harvested 24 h after IHNV infection, and total RNA was extracted. One μg of the total RNA was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and the first gene-specific primer, 5′-GAGCTCTAACTTCAGATGCAAATTC-3′. A poly(C) tail was added to the 3′-end of the cDNA using terminal transferase (Invitrogen). The dC-tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR with 5′ RACE-abridged anchor primer and the second gene-specific primer, 5′-AAATTCGTTAACTGCAATACTTTGG-3′. The PCR was allowed to proceed for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product was reamplified by nested PCR with an universal amplification primer and the nested gene-specific primer, 5′-TTCGAATAGATATAACACGCCATCT-3′. The PCR reaction was performed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The 5′ RACE amplification product was cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). Total RNA was extracted from mock infected or IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cells, and the RNA samples (20 μg) were transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences; Hybond-N). Hybridization was done with [α-32P]CTP-labeled probes prepared by the random oligonucleotide priming method. The probe used was the gene amplification product of 186 bp. For the expression of the VISP in E. coli, a plasmid (pET-VISP) was constructed by inserting the full-length cDNA corresponding to the VISPinto the NcoI-XhoI site of a pET29b in the correct reading frame. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET-VISP. VISP was expressed as the His-tagged protein in E. coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His·bind resin, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). α-Glucosidase (Sigma) was denatured at a concentration of 15 μm in 8 murea, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. Renaturation was initiated by a 50-fold dilution in 40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, at 20 °C, in the absence of any additional protein or in the presence of various concentrations of VISP, 5 μm DnaK (StressGen), 20 μm bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The enzymatic activity of α-glucosidase was measured as described by Jakob et al. (37Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1517-1520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equine liver ADH (Sigma) was dissolved at a concentration of 5 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA, and the aggregation of ADH at 37 °C was then monitored in the absence or presence of VISP by measuring the absorbance at 360 nm using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. Protein data base searches were performed with the National Center for Biotechnology BLAST Network services. The comparison and alignment of the VISP translation product were performed using Clustal W sequence alignment. We have shown previously that the expression of a VISP is induced in fish cells by IHNV infection (1Cho W.J. Cha S.J., Do, J.W. Choi J.Y. Lee J.Y. Jeong C.S. Cho K.J. Choi W.S. Kang H.S. Kim H.D.

To further characterize this protein, strategies were developed to isolate and purify the protein using IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cells as the starting material. Immunoprecipitation was used to isolate the VISP from the cell lysate of IHNV-infected cells, and this produced a highly purified VISP (Fig.1 A). The protein was confirmed to correspond to the VISP by Western blotting analysis using mAb AB7 against this protein (Fig. 1 B). The proteins were further purified by electroelution from the SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the band was excised and submitted for N-terminal protein sequencing. Alternatively, the protein purified by electroelution was subjected to Arg-C digestion and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and several major bands were excised and submitted for internal protein sequencing analysis. N-terminal protein sequencing revealed a blocked N terminus. Analysis of the Arg-C digestion product resulted in the determination of the primary sequences of three peptides, VISP-5, VISP-7, and VISP-9 (Table I). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on the standard triplicate code using the amino acid sequences of the peptides VISP-5, VISP-7, and VISP-9 (Table I). These oligonucleotides were used for a gene amplification of the IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cell cDNA library. Amplification of the cDNA with primer sets 9F-5R resulted in a unique 186-bp DNA fragment. When this fragment was sequenced and the conceptual translation product was examined, the amino acids from peptides VISP-9 and VISP-5 were revealed, including amino acids that were not utilized in the design of the oligonucleotides (Fig.2). These results confirmed that this fragment corresponded to a cDNA with sequence homology to theVISP gene. The 186-bp DNA fragment was labeled and used as a probe to screen the IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cell cDNA library. Approximately 200,000 plaques were screened in duplicate, and 20 positive colonies were identified. Ten plaques were subjected to secondary screening, and two of them were purified by tertiary screening. The cDNA inserts were excised into pBlueScript and sequenced completely in both directions. They were found to contain a 1659-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1086–2744 (Fig.3). The 5′-end of this phage clone lacked an ATG initiation codon and, therefore, represented an incomplete cDNA. To isolate a full-length cDNA clone for the VISP, 5′ RACE was performed on RNA isolated from IHNV-infected CHSE-214 cells. This procedure yielded nucleotides 1–1085 in the composite sequence and included the ATG start codon. The 2193-bp open reading frame (nucleotides 273–2465) encodes a conceptual translation product of 730 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 79.84 kDa. The sequences of all three peptides determined by protein sequencing were identified in the conceptual translation product.Figure 3The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of VISP cDNA.

GenBankTMaccession number associated with this sequence is AF527060.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the cloned gene showed an expression pattern matching that previously determined for virus stimulation of the VISP synthesis (1Cho W.J. Cha S.J., Do, J.W. Choi J.Y. Lee J.Y. Jeong C.S. Cho K.J. Choi W.S. Kang H.S. Kim H.D. Park J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the amount of mRNA was measured at various times after the virus infection by Northern blotting of RNA (Fig. 4). In mock-infected normal cells, there was no increase in the level of the transcription of the VISP throughout the incubation period of 48 h. However, in IHNV-infected cells, the transcript increased prominently at 24 h post-infection. This pattern of hybridization indicates that the VISP gene expression is induced by virus infection as had been shown previously by an analysis of the protein synthesis in IHNV-infected cells. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the VISP with those in the GenBankTM data base revealed no similarity with other genes. However, a conserved domain search using reverse position-specific BLAST identified domains of SBP_bac_5 in two regions, Glu5 to Leu57 and Val215 to Asp561. The amino acid sequence of these two regions exhibited similarity with members of SBP_bac_5, including oligopeptide-binding protein (OPPA), dipeptide-binding protein (DPPE), periplasmic dipeptide transport protein (DPPA), oligopeptide-binding protein (APPA), and peptide transport periplasmic protein (SAPA). The region Val215 to Asp561 of VISP exhibits 16–21% identity with members of the SBP_bac_5 and is most similar (21% identity) to the OPPA of Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (38Bao Q. Tian Y., Li, W., Xu, Z. Xuan Z., Hu, S. Dong W. Yang J. Chen Y. Xue Y., Xu, Y. Lai X. Huang L. Dong X., Ma, Y. Ling L. Tan H. Chen R. Wang J., Yu, J. Yang H. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Although the VISP within these two regions exhibits similarity with members of SBP_bac_5, the VISP outside these regions exhibits little similarity with any other genes in the GenBankTM. Our previous results suggest that the VISP has characteristics of a stress protein (1Cho W.J. Cha S.J., Do, J.W. Choi J.Y. Lee J.Y. Jeong C.S. Cho K.J. Choi W.S. Kang H.S. Kim H.D. Park J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequence of this protein shows similarity with OPPA and DPPA, members of SBP_bac_5 proposed to have chaperone activity (33Richarme G. Caldas T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15607-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 34Matsuzaki M. Kiso Y. Yamamoto I. Satoh T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2718-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the VISP acts as a molecular chaperone in the folding of proteins. Overexpressed recombinant VISP was purified fromE. coli BL21 as a His-tagged protein. This recombinant protein was recognized by mAb AB7 raised against the VISP (29Lee J.Y. Cho W.J., Do, J.W.

Virol. 1996; 77: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), but its band was a little shifted up because of the His tag (Fig.6). α-Glucosidase, whose refolding is facilitated by several chaperones, such as GroEL, HSP90, and small HSPs (37Jakob U.

It was unfolded in the presence of 8 m urea and allowed to refold upon the dilution of the denaturant in the absence of added protein or in the presence of the VISP (protein folding in the presence of DnaK and bovine serum albumin was comparatively studied). Under our experimental conditions, the refolding yield of 0.3 mα-glucosidase was increased from 4% in the absence of added proteins to 48% in the presence of 1 μm VISP and to 16% in the presence of 5 μm DnaK. The addition of 20 μm bovine serum albumin did not affect the refolding of α-glucosidase (Fig. 7 A). The dependence of α-glucosidase reactivation on the concentrations of added VISP is shown in Fig. 7 B. The maximal recovery of enzyme activity attains 52% in the presence of 3 μmVISP, and half-maximal reactivation occurs at 0.5 μm.Figure 7Influence of VISP on the refolding of urea-denatured α-glucosidase.

But as [Janka][1] explains in his Perspective, the visible event corresponds to less than 1% of the energy involved in a supernova. Recent models and observations are beginning to shed light on how energy is transferred from the collapsing core of the star to the ejected matter.
