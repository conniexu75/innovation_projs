Homsy et al. performed exome sequence analysis of 1200 CHD patients and their parents to identify spontaneously arising (de novo) mutations. Patients with both CHD and neurodevelopmental disorders had a much higher burden of damaging de novo mutations, particularly in genes with likely roles in both heart and brain development. Thus, clinical genotyping of patients with CHD may help to identify those at greatest risk of neurodevelopmental disabilities, allowing surveillance and early intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2259812487,"Global temperature targets, such as the widely accepted limit of an increase above pre-industrial temperatures of two degrees Celsius, may fail to communicate the urgency of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The translation of CO2 emissions into regional- and impact-related climate targets could be more powerful because such targets are more directly aligned with individual national interests. We illustrate this approach using regional changes in extreme temperatures and precipitation. These scale robustly with global temperature across scenarios, and thus with cumulative CO2 emissions. This is particularly relevant for changes in regional extreme temperatures on land, which are much greater than changes in the associated global mean. Targets for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide are related to regional changes in climate extremes rather than to changes in global mean temperature, in order to convey their urgency better to individual countries. A major theme in the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was that global mean surface temperature scales linearly with cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases. Sonia Seneviratne et al. show that a similar scaling exists between cumulative emissions and regional changes in the occurrence of extremes in precipitation and temperatures. The presentation of targets regionally, rather than globally, has the advantage of conveying their urgency better to individual countries."
https://openalex.org/W2190642228,"A change of heart (mitochondria) Mitochondria provide an essential source of energy to drive cellular processes and are particularly important in heart muscle cells (see the Perspective by Gottlieb and Bernstein). After birth, the availability of oxygen and nutrients to organs and tissues changes. This invokes changes in metabolism. Gong et al. studied the developmental transitions in mouse heart mitochondria soon after birth. Mitochondria were replaced wholesale via mitophagy in cardiomyocytes over the first 3 weeks after birth. Preventing this turnover by interfering with parkin-mediated mitophagy specifically in cardiomyocytes prevented the normal metabolic transition and caused heart failure. Thus, the heart has coopted a quality-control pathway to facilitate a major developmental transition after birth. Wai et al. examined the role of mitochondrial fission and fusion in mouse cardiomyocytes. Disruption of these processes led to “middle-aged” death from a form of dilated cardiomyopathy. Mice destined to develop cardiomyopathy were protected by feeding with a high-fat diet, which altered cardiac metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2301918656,"In developing hearts, changes in the cardiac metabolic milieu during the perinatal period redirect mitochondrial substrate preference from carbohydrates to fatty acids. Mechanisms responsible for this mitochondrial plasticity are unknown. Here, we found that PINK1-Mfn2-Parkin-mediated mitophagy directs this metabolic transformation in mouse hearts. A mitofusin (Mfn) 2 mutant lacking PINK1 phosphorylation sites necessary for Parkin binding (Mfn2 AA) inhibited mitochondrial Parkin translocation, suppressing mitophagy without impairing mitochondrial fusion. Cardiac Parkin deletion or expression of Mfn2 AA from birth, but not after weaning, prevented postnatal mitochondrial maturation essential to survival. Five-week-old Mfn2 AA hearts retained a fetal mitochondrial transcriptional signature without normal increases in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. Myocardial fatty acylcarnitine levels and cardiomyocyte respiration induced by palmitoylcarnitine were concordantly depressed. Thus, instead of transcriptional reprogramming, fetal cardiomyocyte mitochondria undergo perinatal Parkin-mediated mitophagy and replacement by mature adult mitochondria. Mitophagic mitochondrial removal underlies developmental cardiomyocyte mitochondrial plasticity and metabolic transitioning of perinatal hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2295313298,"Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which sustain production of all blood cell lineages, rely on glycolysis for ATP production, yet little attention has been paid to the role of mitochondria. Here we show in mice that the short isoform of a critical regulator of HSCs, Prdm16 (refs 4, 5), induces mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a protein involved in mitochondrial fusion and in tethering of mitochondria to the endoplasmic reticulum. Overexpression and deletion studies, including single-cell transplantation assays, revealed that Mfn2 is specifically required for the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential, but not, or less so, for the maintenance of myeloid-dominant HSCs. Mfn2 increased buffering of intracellular Ca(2+), an effect mediated through its endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria tethering activity, thereby negatively regulating nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear factor of activated T cells (Nfat). Nfat inhibition rescued the effects of Mfn2 deletion in HSCs, demonstrating that negative regulation of Nfat is the prime downstream mechanism of Mfn2 in the maintenance of HSCs with extensive lymphoid potential. Mitochondria therefore have an important role in HSCs. These findings provide a mechanism underlying clonal heterogeneity among HSCs and may lead to the design of approaches to bias HSC differentiation into desired lineages after transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2267382996,"Regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 have a pivotal role in maintaining immunological self-tolerance; yet, excessive Treg cell activities suppress anti-tumour immune responses. Compared to the resting Treg (rTreg) cell phenotype in secondary lymphoid organs, Treg cells in non-lymphoid tissues exhibit an activated Treg (aTreg) cell phenotype. However, the function of aTreg cells and whether their generation can be manipulated are largely unexplored. Here we show that the transcription factor Foxo1, previously demonstrated to promote Treg cell suppression of lymphoproliferative diseases, has an unexpected function in inhibiting aTreg-cell-mediated immune tolerance in mice. We find that aTreg cells turned over at a slower rate than rTreg cells, but were not locally maintained in tissues. aTreg cell differentiation was associated with repression of Foxo1-dependent gene transcription, concomitant with reduced Foxo1 expression, cytoplasmic localization and enhanced phosphorylation at the Akt sites. Treg-cell-specific expression of an Akt-insensitive Foxo1 mutant prevented downregulation of lymphoid organ homing molecules, and impeded Treg cell homing to non-lymphoid organs, causing CD8(+) T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Compared to Treg cells from healthy tissues, tumour-infiltrating Treg cells downregulated Foxo1 target genes more substantially. Expression of the Foxo1 mutant at a lower dose was sufficient to deplete tumour-associated Treg cells, activate effector CD8(+) T cells, and inhibit tumour growth without inflicting autoimmunity. Thus, Foxo1 inactivation is essential for the migration of aTreg cells that have a crucial function in suppressing CD8(+) T-cell responses; and the Foxo signalling pathway in Treg cells can be titrated to break tumour immune tolerance preferentially."
https://openalex.org/W2252335677,"Ubiquitination is a central process affecting all facets of cellular signalling and function. A critical step in ubiquitination is the transfer of ubiquitin from an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to a substrate or a growing ubiquitin chain, which is mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligases. RING-type E3 ligases typically facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 directly to the substrate. The RING-between-RING (RBR) family of RING-type E3 ligases, however, breaks this paradigm by forming a covalent intermediate with ubiquitin similarly to HECT-type E3 ligases. The RBR family includes Parkin and HOIP, the central catalytic factor of the LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex). While structural insights into the RBR E3 ligases Parkin and HHARI in their overall auto-inhibited forms are available, no structures exist of intact fully active RBR E3 ligases or any of their complexes. Thus, the RBR mechanism of action has remained largely unknown. Here we present the first structure, to our knowledge, of the fully active human HOIP RBR in its transfer complex with an E2~ubiquitin conjugate, which elucidates the intricate nature of RBR E3 ligases. The active HOIP RBR adopts a conformation markedly different from that of auto-inhibited RBRs. HOIP RBR binds the E2~ubiquitin conjugate in an elongated fashion, with the E2 and E3 catalytic centres ideally aligned for ubiquitin transfer, which structurally both requires and enables a HECT-like mechanism. In addition, three distinct helix-IBR-fold motifs inherent to RBRs form ubiquitin-binding regions that engage the activated ubiquitin of the E2~ubiquitin conjugate and, surprisingly, an additional regulatory ubiquitin molecule. The features uncovered reveal critical states of the HOIP RBR E3 ligase cycle, and comparison with Parkin and HHARI suggests a general mechanism for RBR E3 ligases."
https://openalex.org/W2271635813,"Cellular immunity against viral infection and tumour cells depends on antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. Intracellular antigenic peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and then loaded onto the nascent MHC I molecules, which are exported to the cell surface and present peptides to the immune system. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize non-self peptides and program the infected or malignant cells for apoptosis. Defects in TAP account for immunodeficiency and tumour development. To escape immune surveillance, some viruses have evolved strategies either to downregulate TAP expression or directly inhibit TAP activity. So far, neither the architecture of TAP nor the mechanism of viral inhibition has been elucidated at the structural level. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TAP in complex with its inhibitor ICP47, a small protein produced by the herpes simplex virus I. Here we show that the 12 transmembrane helices and 2 cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains of the transporter adopt an inward-facing conformation with the two nucleotide-binding domains separated. The viral inhibitor ICP47 forms a long helical hairpin, which plugs the translocation pathway of TAP from the cytoplasmic side. Association of ICP47 precludes substrate binding and prevents nucleotide-binding domain closure necessary for ATP hydrolysis. This work illustrates a striking example of immune evasion by persistent viruses. By blocking viral antigens from entering the endoplasmic reticulum, herpes simplex virus is hidden from cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which may contribute to establishing a lifelong infection in the host."
https://openalex.org/W2400868641,"Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is an economically important beverage crop. Drought stress (DS) seriously limits the growth and development of tea plant, thus affecting crop yield and quality. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of tea plant responding to DS, we performed transcriptomic analysis of tea plant during the three stages [control (CK) and during DS, and recovery (RC) after DS] using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Totally 378.08 million high-quality trimmed reads were obtained and assembled into 59,674 unigenes, which were extensively annotated. There were 5,955 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three stages. Among them, 3,948 and 1,673 DEGs were up-regulated under DS and RC, respectively. RNA-Seq data were further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. Genes involved in abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling were generally up-regulated under DS and down-regulated during RC. Tea plant potentially used an exchange pathway for biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and salicylic acid under DS. IAA signaling was possibly decreased under DS but increased after RC. Genes encoding enzymes involved in cytokinin synthesis were up-regulated under DS, but down-regulated during RC. It seemed probable that cytokinin signaling was slightly enhanced under DS. In total, 762 and 950 protein kinases belonging to 26 families were differentially expressed during DS and RC, respectively. Overall, 547 and 604 transcription factor (TF) genes belonging to 58 families were induced in the DS vs. CK and RC vs. DS libraries, respectively. Most members of the 12 TF families were up-regulated under DS. Under DS, genes related to starch synthesis were down-regulated, while those related to starch decomposition were up-regulated. Mannitol, trehalose and sucrose synthesis-related genes were up-regulated under DS. Proline was probably mainly biosynthesized from glutamate under DS and RC. The mechanism by which ABA regulated stomatal movement under DS and RC was partly clarified. These results document the global and novel responses of tea plant during DS and RC. These data will serve as a valuable resource for drought-tolerance research and will be useful for breeding drought-resistant tea cultivars."

The transcription factor Bach2 represses Blimp-1 expression in B cells to stall terminal differentiation, by which it supports reactions such as class switch recombination of the antibody genes.

More specifically, little is known about the co-regulators of Bach2 or the epigenetic regulation of Prdm1 in B and plasma cells. Here, we compare changes in acetylation and methylation of histones at the Prdm1 locus before and after plasma cell differentiation, and we purified the Bach2 protein complex to identify proteins involved in this epigenetic regulation. The Bach2 complex was purified from nuclear extracts prepared from BAL17 cells stably expressing FLAG-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Bach2 (eBach2) as described previously (15Ochiai K. Katoh Y.

The eBach2-expressing cells were collected by centrifugation for 8 min at 1,865 × g and were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,190 × g, the pellets were suspended in 6 volumes of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 10 mm KCl, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), 40 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) and were then collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,190 × g. Next, the cells were resuspended in the same volume of hypotonic buffer, and the suspensions were homogenized and centrifuged for 15 min at 2,330 × g to collect the nuclei. The obtained crude nuclei were then suspended in a half-volume of low salt buffer (0.02 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) for homogenization. The resulting suspension was dropped with a half-volume of high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and then stirred gently for 60 min and centrifuged for 60 min at 48,384 × g. The supernatants were dialyzed against 50 volumes of BC-0 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm 2-ME, 40 μm PMSF) until the conductivity reached 65–70 microsiemens/cm. The dialysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 23,700 × g, and the supernatant was used as a nuclear extract. eBach2 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts by incubating with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) for 4 h with rotation. After an extensive wash with 0.1 m KCl-containing buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted from FLAG M2-agarose by incubating for 60 min with the FLAG peptide in the same buffer (0.5 mg/ml). The eluates were then incubated with anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads for 4 h with rotation. After extensive washing with 0.1 m KCl-containing buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted from anti-HA antibody-conjugated beads by incubating with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% gel, and the gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained bands were excised from the gel, and the proteins therein were subjected to in-gel reduction, S-carboxyamidomethylation, and digestion with trypsin (Promega). The molecular masses of the tryptic peptides were determined using LC-HCT plus (Bruker Daltonics), and protein identification was performed using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science). The proteins interacting with Bach2 were isolated also by another method based on the one called “ReCLIP” (21Smith A.L. Friedman D.B. Yu H. Carnahan R.H. Reynolds A.B.

Approximately 1 × 108 BAL17 cells were fixed in PBS containing 0.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and 0.5 mm dithiobismaleimidoethane, and then they were treated with Tris and l-cysteine in PBS for quenching. The fixed cells were suspended in RIPA buffer, and after supersonic treatment and centrifugation, the cleared lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG magnetic beads (Sigma M8823) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with RIPA buffer, and the proteins bound to the beads were eluted using 0.1 μg/μl FLAG peptide. The eluted proteins were treated with 50 mm DTT to dissolve the cross-link and were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 5–20% polyacrylamide gel (Oriental Instruments). After staining with 60 mg/liter Coomassie Brilliant Blue-G-250 and 35 mm HCl (22Lawrence A.M. Besir H.U. Staining of proteins in gels with Coomassie G-250 without organic solvent and acetic acid.J. Vis. Exp. 2009; 30: 1350Google Scholar), each lane in the gel was divided into 12 sections, and the resulting gel blocks were treated with DTT for reduction and then with acrylamide for alkylation of the sulfhydryl groups. The proteins in every gel block were digested overnight by 10–20 ng of trypsin (Promega). The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel with 75% acetonitrile and 0.5% formic acid and were concentrated in a SpeedVac. One-half of each sample was analyzed using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos with ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a PAL HTC-xt autosampler (AMR) and an ADVANCE HPLC system (AMR, Tokyo, Japan). The peptides were separated on a PepSwift Monolithic Column (100 μm inner diameter × 25 cm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min with a 60-min linear gradient generated by aqueous solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and organic solvent B (100% acetonitrile) as follows: 2.5–22.5% B in 52 min, to 35% B in 56 min, to 95% B in 58 min, and they were directly electrosprayed into the mass spectrometer. The data acquisition of every sample was carried out for 70 min after the LC gradient was started, in which MS1 scans from m/z = 321 to 1,800 were carried out in the orbitrap with the resolution set at 100,000 with a lock mass at m/z = 445.120025, followed by sequential isolation of the 20 most intense precursor ions and MS2 acquisition by collision-induced dissociation in the ion trap in the normal resolution mode. The settings for MS2 scans were as follows: minimal signal intensity required = 500, isolation width = 2 m/z, AGC target = 10,000, maximum ion injection time = 200 ms, normal collision energy = 35, activation time = 10 ms, microscan = 1, and dynamic exclusion was enabled with a 60-s exclusion duration. The raw data files derived from samples in the same SDS-PAGE lane were converted together into a single MASCOT generic format file and used for the database search by MASCOT (version 2.5.1, Matrix Science) against the human proteins in SwissProt (Feb., 2015), and a custom database, including contaminant proteins and the FLAG-tagged mouse Bach2 protein. A maximum of three trypsin miscleavages was allowed. The peptide mass tolerance and MS/MS tolerance were set at 5 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. Protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106), oxidation of methionine (+15.9949), phosphorylation at serine/threonine (+79.9663), propionamidation at cysteine (+71.0371), propionamidated dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) at lysine (+159.0354), and propionamidated dithiobismaleimidoethane at cysteine (+246.0674) were considered to be variable modifications. Peptides identified with MASCOT expectation values of <0.05 were selected as significant hits. The false discovery rates calculated by decoy database search were 2.05% in mock IP and 1.79% in FLAG-Bach2 IP.

ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Thermo Scientific Pierce) were used to detect antibody-antigen complexes. His-tagged mouse Bach2 protein (amino acid residues 119–318) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel resin. The recombinant Bach2 protein was used to immunize a rabbit, resulting in anti-Bach2 antisera (Bach2N-1 and N-2). These antisera were found useful for the immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation assays. Whole cell extracts of BAL17 cells were pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 2 h and immunoprecipitated with the anti-Bach2 antiserum (Bach2N-2) or anti-HDAC3 antibody (NB500-126; Novus) for 2 h to analyze the interaction of endogenous proteins. Immunoprecipitates were recovered with protein G-Sepharose beads and were washed seven times. Samples were analyzed by immunoblot analysis as described above (25Yamasaki C. Tashiro S. Nishito Y.

The secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare). In some experiments, rabbit IgG TrueBlot (eBioscience) was used to eliminate the interference of signal detection by the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. For primary B cell immunoprecipitation, ReCLIP was carried by using control IgG or anti-Bach2 antibodies (Bach2N-1) that were conjugated with beads, followed by immunoblot analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2272519159,"NK cells accumulate at the maternal-fetal interface (MFI) and play essential roles in maintaining immune tolerance during pregnancy. The mechanisms that facilitate NK cells tolerance to fetal tissue are largely unknown. T cell Ig and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) is a newly defined molecule with essential immunological function in many physiological and pathological processes. Recent study showed that Tim-3 was involved in the regulation of immune tolerance at MFI. However, whether Tim-3 regulates NK cells cytotoxicity toward trophoblasts is unclear. Here, we showed Tim-3 was mainly expressed by decidual NK cells (dNK) and Tim-3 level in dNK was higher than peripheral NK cells (pNK). Tim-3(+) dNK expressed more levels of mature markers CD94 and CD69 than Tim-3- dNK cells and blocking Tim-3 significantly inhibited dNK IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion. Furthermore, we found TGF-β1 may contribute to such up-regulation of Tim-3 in NK cells. Interestingly, blocking Tim-3 enhanced NK cytotoxicity toward trophoblast cell line HTR-8 but not K562. We found HTR-8 expressed Tim-3 ligand Galectin-9, in contrast K562 did not. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of Galectin-9 expression enhanced NK cytotoxicity toward HTR-8. We further showed Tim-3/Galecin-9 inhibited NK cytotoxicity toward trophoblast partially via impairing the degranulation process. In addition, clinical data showed that abnormal Tim-3 level on pNK might be associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). Thus, our data demonstrate Tim-3/Galectin-9 pathway maintains local tolerance by suppressing NK cytotoxicity toward trophoblasts which may represent a new immunologic tolerance mechanism at MFI."
https://openalex.org/W2253822381,"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is a serine/threonine kinase with essential function in necroptosis. The activity of RIPK3 is controlled by phosphorylation. Once activated, RIPK3 phosphorylates and activates the downstream effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) to induce necroptosis. In certain situations, RIPK3 has also been shown to promote apoptosis or cytokine expression in a necroptosis and kinase-independent manner. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for selective degradation of cellular proteins and thus has a critical role in many cellular processes such as cell survival and cell death. Clinically, proteasome inhibition has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent. Here we show that the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib activate the RIPK3-MLKL necroptotic pathway in mouse fibroblasts as well as human leukemia cells. Unlike necroptosis induced by classical TNF-like cytokines, necroptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors does not require caspase inhibition. However, an intact RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) is essential. Surprisingly, when recruitment of MLKL to RIPK3 is restricted, proteasome inhibitors induced RIPK3-dependent apoptosis. Proteasome inhibition led to accumulation of K48-linked ubiquitinated RIPK3, which was partially reduced when Lys-264 was mutated. Taken together, these results reveal the ubiquitin-proteasome system as a novel regulatory mechanism for RIPK3-dependent necroptosis."

Although each agonist appears to stimulate the same suite of downstream signaling proteins, different agonists are capable of inducing distinct responses in the same cell. To determine the basis for these differences, we used luciferase fragment complementation imaging to monitor the recruitment of Cbl, CrkL, Gab1, Grb2, PI3K, p52 Shc, p66 Shc, and Shp2 to the EGF receptor when stimulated by the seven EGF receptor ligands. Recruitment of all eight proteins was rapid, dose-dependent, and inhibited by erlotinib and lapatinib, although to differing extents. Comparison of the time course of recruitment of the eight proteins in response to a fixed concentration of each growth factor revealed differences among the growth factors that could contribute to their differing biological effects. Principal component analysis of the resulting data set confirmed that the recruitment of these proteins differed between agonists and also between different doses of the same agonist. Ensemble clustering of the overall response to the different growth factors suggests that these EGF receptor ligands fall into two major groups as follows: (i) EGF, amphiregulin, and EPR; and (ii) betacellulin, TGFα, and epigen.

https://openalex.org/W2338767585,"Natural products play an invaluable role as a starting point in the drug discovery process, and plants and animals use many interesting biologically active natural products as a chemical defense mechanism against predators. Among marine organisms, many nudibranch gastropods are known to derive defensive metabolites from the sponges they eat. Here we investigated the putative sequestration of the toxic compound latrunculin A--a 16-membered macrolide that prevents actin polymerization within cellular processes--which has been identified from sponge sources, by five closely related nudibranch molluscs of the genus Chromodoris. Only latrunculin A was present in the rim of the mantle of these species, where storage reservoirs containing secondary metabolites are located, whilst a variety of secondary metabolites were found in their viscera. The species studied thus selectively accumulate latrunculin A in the part of the mantle that is more exposed to potential predators. This study also demonstrates that latrunculin-containing sponges are not their sole food source. Latrunculin A was found to be several times more potent than other compounds present in these species of nudibranchs when tested by in vitro and in vivo toxicity assays. Anti-feedant assays also indicated that latrunculin A was unpalatable to rock pool shrimps, in a dose-dependent manner. These findings led us to propose that this group of nudibranchs has evolved means both to protect themselves from the toxicity of latrunculin A, and to accumulate this compound in the mantle rim for defensive purposes. The precise mechanism by which the nudibranchs sequester such a potent compound from sponges without disrupting their own key physiological processes is unclear, but this work paves the way for future studies in this direction. Finally, the possible occurrence of both visual and chemosensory Müllerian mimicry in the studied species is discussed."

The AGEs can be formed via degradation of early glycation intermediates (glycoxidation) and by interaction with the products of monosaccharide autoxidation (autoxidative glycosylation). Although formation of these potentially deleterious compounds is well characterized in animal systems and thermally treated foods, only a little information about advanced glycation in plants is available. Thus, the knowledge of the plant AGE patterns and the underlying pathways of their formation are completely missing. To fill this gap, we describe the AGE-modified proteome of Brassica napus and characterize individual sites of advanced glycation by the methods of liquid chromatography-based bottom-up proteomics. The modification patterns were complex but reproducible: 789 AGE-modified peptides in 772 proteins were detected in two independent experiments. In contrast, only 168 polypeptides contained early glycated lysines, which did not resemble the sites of advanced glycation. Similar observations were made with Arabidopsis thaliana. The absence of the early glycated precursors of the AGE-modified protein residues indicated autoxidative glycosylation, but not glycoxidation, as the major pathway of AGE formation. To prove this assumption and to identify the potential modifying agents, we estimated the reactivity and glycative potential of plant-derived sugars using a model peptide approach and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based techniques.

https://openalex.org/W2281650010,"Aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) contributes to beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes and islet transplantation. Like other amyloidogenic peptides, human IAPP induces macrophage IL-1β secretion by stimulating both the synthesis and processing of proIL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that (when chronically elevated) impairs beta cell insulin secretion. We sought to determine the specific mechanism of IAPP-induced proIL-1β synthesis. Soluble IAPP species produced early during IAPP aggregation provided a Toll-like-receptor-2- (TLR2-) dependent stimulus for NF-κB activation in HEK 293 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Non-amyloidogenic rodent IAPP and thioflavin-T-positive fibrillar amyloid produced by human IAPP aggregation failed to activate TLR2. Blockade of TLR6 but not TLR1 prevented hIAPP-induced TLR2 activation, consistent with stimulation of a TLR2/6 heterodimer. TLR2 and its downstream adaptor protein MyD88 were required for IAPP-induced cytokine production by BMDMs, a process that is partially dependent on autoinduction by IL-1. BMDMs treated with soluble but not fibrillar IAPP provided a TLR2-dependent priming stimulus for ATP-induced IL-1β secretion, whereas late IAPP aggregates induced NLRP3-dependent IL-1β secretion by LPS-primed macrophages. Moreover, inhibition of TLR2 and depletion of islet macrophages prevented up-regulation of Il1b and Tnf expression in human IAPP-expressing transgenic mouse islets. These data suggest participation by both soluble and fibrillar aggregates in IAPP-induced islet inflammation. IAPP-induced activation of TLR2 and secretion of IL-1 may be important therapeutic targets to prevent amyloid-associated beta cell dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2288788281,"There is increasing evidence that metformin, a commonly used treatment for diabetes, might have the potential to be repurposed as an economical and safe cancer therapeutic. The aim of this study was to determine whether stage III-IV or recurrent endometrial cancer patients who are using metformin during treatment with chemotherapy have improved survival. To test this we analyzed a retrospective cohort of subjects at two independent institutions who received chemotherapy for stage III-IV or recurrent endometrial cancer from 1992 to 2011. Diagnosis of diabetes, metformin use, demographics, endometrial cancer clinico-pathologic parameters, and survival duration were abstracted. The primary outcome was overall survival. The final cohort included 349 patients, 31 (8.9%) had diabetes and used metformin, 28 (8.0%) had diabetes but did not use metformin, and 291 (83.4%) did not have diabetes. The results demonstrate that the median overall survival was 45.6 months for patients with diabetes who used metformin compared to 12.5 months for patients with diabetes who did not use metformin and 28.5 months for patients without diabetes (log-rank test comparing the three groups P = 0.006). In a model adjusted for confounders, the difference in survival between the three groups remained statistically significant (P = 0.023). The improvement in survival among metformin users was not explained by better baseline health status or more aggressive use of chemotherapy.

Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine responses to immune challenges contribute to neuronal death during neurodegeneration. In order to investigate the role of glial cells in this phenomenon, we developed a modified method to remove the non-neuronal cells in primary cultures of E16.5 mouse cortex. We modified previously reported methods as we found that a brief treatment with the thymidine analog, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU), is sufficient to substantially deplete dividing non-neuronal cells in primary cultures. Cell cycle and glial markers confirm the loss of ~99% of all microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). More importantly, under this milder treatment, the neurons suffered neither cell loss nor any morphological defects up to 2.5 weeks later; both pre- and post-synaptic markers were retained. Further, neurons in FdU-treated cultures remained responsive to excitotoxicity induced by glutamate application. The immunobiology of the FdU culture, however, was significantly changed. Compared with mixed culture, the protein levels of NFκB p65 and the gene expression of several cytokine receptors were altered. Individual cytokines or conditioned medium from β-amyloid-stimulated THP-1 cells that were, potent neurotoxins in normal, mixed cultures, were virtually inactive in the absence of glial cells. The results highlight the importance of our glial-depleted culture system and identifies and offer unexpected insights into the complexity of -brain neuroinflammation."

PCC 6803, and elongation factor G has been identified as a target of oxidation by ROS. In the present study we examined the sensitivity to oxidation by ROS of another elongation factor, EF-Tu. The structure of EF-Tu changes dramatically depending on the bound nucleotide. Therefore, we investigated the sensitivity to oxidation in vitro of GTP- and GDP-bound EF-Tu as well as that of nucleotide-free EF-Tu. Assays of translational activity with a reconstituted translation system from Escherichia coli revealed that GTP-bound and nucleotide-free EF-Tu were sensitive to oxidation by H2O2, whereas GDP-bound EF-Tu was resistant to H2O2. The inactivation of EF-Tu was the result of oxidation of Cys-82, a single cysteine residue, and subsequent formation of both an intermolecular disulfide bond and sulfenic acid. Replacement of Cys-82 with serine rendered EF-Tu resistant to inactivation by H2O2, confirming that Cys-82 was a target of oxidation. Furthermore, oxidized EF-Tu was reduced and reactivated by thioredoxin. Gel-filtration chromatography revealed that some of the oxidized nucleotide-free EF-Tu formed large complexes of >30 molecules. Atomic force microscopy revealed that such large complexes dissociated into several smaller aggregates upon the addition of dithiothreitol. Immunological analysis of the redox state of EF-Tu in vivo showed that levels of oxidized EF-Tu increased under strong light. Thus, resembling elongation factor G, EF-Tu appears to be sensitive to ROS via oxidation of a cysteine residue, and its inactivation might be reversed in a redox-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W2256385491,"Introduction Macular degeneration (MD) can cause a central visual field defect. In a previous study, we found volumetric reductions along the entire visual pathways of MD patients, possibly indicating degeneration of inactive neuronal tissue. This may have important implications. In particular, new therapeutic strategies to restore retinal function rely on intact visual pathways and cortex to reestablish visual function. Here we reanalyze the data of our previous study using surface-based morphometry (SBM) rather than voxel-based morphometry (VBM). This can help determine the robustness of the findings and will lead to a better understanding of the nature of neuroanatomical changes associated with MD. Methods The metrics of interest were acquired by performing SBM analysis on T1-weighted MRI data acquired from 113 subjects: patients with juvenile MD (JMD; n = 34), patients with age-related MD (AMD; n = 24) and healthy age-matched controls (HC; n = 55). Results Relative to age-matched controls, JMD patients showed a thinner cortex, a smaller cortical surface area and a lower grey matter volume in V1 and V2, while AMD patients showed thinning of the cortex in V2. Neither patient group showed a significant difference in mean curvature of the visual cortex. Discussion The thinner cortex, smaller surface area and lower grey matter volume in the visual cortex of JMD patients are consistent with our previous results showing a volumetric reduction in their visual cortex. Finding comparable results using two rather different analysis techniques suggests the presence of marked cortical degeneration in the JMD patients. In the AMD patients, we found a thinner cortex in V2 but not in V1. In contrast to our previous VBM analysis, SBM revealed no volumetric reductions of the visual cortex. This suggests that the cortical changes in AMD patients are relatively subtle, as they apparently can be missed by one of the methods."
https://openalex.org/W2279303511,"A type 3 secretion system is used by many bacterial pathogens to inject proteins into eukaryotic cells. Pathogens insert a translocon complex into the target eukaryotic membrane by secreting two proteins known as translocators. How these translocators form a translocon in the lipid bilayer and why both proteins are required remains elusive. Pseudomonas aeruginosa translocators PopB and PopD insert pores into membranes forming homo- or hetero-complexes of undetermined stoichiometry. Single-molecule fluorescence photobleaching experiments revealed that PopD formed mostly hexameric structures in membranes, whereas PopB displayed a bi-modal distribution with 6 and 12 subunits peaks. However, individually the proteins are not functional for effector translocation. We have found that when added together, the translocators formed distinct hetero-complexes containing 8 PopB and 8 PopD molecules. Thus, the interaction between PopB and PopD guide the assembly of a unique hetero-oligomer in membranes."

The EQA addressed 445 participants in 10/11 provinces (October 2013–April 2014). Participants were sent a panel of five slides and asked to return a routinely stained slide which was assessed for quality of preparation and staining. Response rate was 89.9% (400/445). For slide 1 (no parasites), 30.6% participants reported malaria, mostly Plasmodium falciparum. Only 11.0% participants reported slide 2 (Plasmodium malariae) correctly, 71.0% reported “malaria” or “Plasmodium falciparum” (considered acceptable). Slide 3 contained Plasmodium falciparum (109/μl) and Trypanosoma brucei brucei trypomastigotes: they were each reported by 32.5% and 16.5% participants respectively, 6.0% reported both. Slide 4 (Trypanosoma) was recognised by 44.9% participants. Slide 5 (Plasmodium ovale) was correctly reported by 6.2% participants, another 68.8% replied “malaria” or “Plasmodium falciparum” (considered acceptable). Only 13.6% of routine slides returned were correctly prepared and stained. The proportion of correct/acceptable scores for at least 4/5 slides was higher among EQA-experienced participants compared to first time participants (40.9% versus 22.4%, p = 0.001) and higher among those being trained < 2 years ago compared to those who were not (42.9% versus 26.3%, p = 0.01). Among diagnostic laboratories in Democratic Republic of the Congo, performance of blood parasite microscopy including non-falciparum species and Trypanosoma was poor. Recent training and previous EQA participation were associated with a better performance."
https://openalex.org/W2329841178,"Viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1), a Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus protein, destabilizes p53 by inhibiting p53 acetylation and Hdm2 phosphorylation. This leads to increased ubiquitination and degradation of p53 by Hdm2, which cripples the cellular p53-mediated antiviral response. Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) deubiquitinates p53 and Hdm2 and regulates their stability. We identified an EGPS consensus sequence in vIRF1, which is identical to that found in Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) that interacts with the N-terminal domain of USP7 (USP7-NTD). GST pulldown assays demonstrated that vIRF1 interacts with USP7-NTD via its EGPS motif. NMR heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) analysis revealed chemical perturbations after titration of USP7-NTD with vIRF1 (44)SPGEGPSGTG(53) peptide. In contrast, these perturbations were reduced with a mutant vIRF1 peptide, (44)SPGEGPAGTG(53). Fluorescence polarization analysis indicated that the vIRF1 peptide interacted with USP7-NTD with a Kd of 2.0 μm. The crystal structure of the USP7-NTD·vIRF1 peptide complex revealed an identical mode of binding as that of the EBNA1 peptide to USP7-NTD. We also showed that USP7 interacts with vIRF1 in U2OS cells. Decreased levels of p53, but not Hdm2 or ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), were seen after expression of vIRF1, but not with a vIRF1 mutant protein. Our results support a new role for vIRF1 through deregulation of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 to inhibit p53-mediated antiviral responses."
https://openalex.org/W2436652328,"It remains challenging to produce decisive vaccines against MUC1, a tumor-associated antigen widely expressed by pancreas, breast and other tumors. Employing clinically relevant mouse models, we ruled out such causes as irreversible T-cell tolerance, inadequate avidity, and failure of T-cells to recognize aberrantly glycosylated tumor MUC1. Instead, every tested MUC1 preparation, even non-glycosylated synthetic 9mer peptides, induced interferon gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that recognized glycosylated variants including tumor-associated MUC1. Vaccination with synthetic peptides conferred protection as long as vaccination was repeated post tumor challenge. Failure to revaccinate post challenge was associated with down-regulated tumor MUC1 and MHC molecules. Surprisingly, direct admixture of MUC1-expressing tumor with MUC1-hyperimmune T-cells could not prevent tumor outgrowth or MUC1 immunoediting, whereas ex vivo activation of the hyperimmune T-cells prior to tumor admixture rendered them curative. Therefore, surrogate T-cell preactivation outside the tumor bed, either in culture or by repetitive vaccination, can overcome tumor escape."

A wealth of medium-to-high resolution structural data for various family members (there are 48 AQP structures in the Protein Data Bank) all suggest that the AQP homotetrameric quaternary structure is highly conserved despite diversity in solute permeability, subcellular localization, and trafficking responses of individual AQPs. Early biochemical work, using carboxyl-amine fusion dimers (consisting of 1 wild-type unit and 1 unit lacking the cysteine residue required for mercurial inhibition), showed that monomers are the functional AQP units (1.Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Molecular structure of the water channel through aquaporin CHIP: the hourglass model.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); numerous molecular dynamics simulation studies support this (2.Hub J.S. Grubmuller H. de Groot B.L. Dynamics and energetics of permeation through aquaporins: what do we learn from molecular dynamics simulations?.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 2009: 57-76Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recent work has suggested that isolated AQP monomers are equally capable of facilitating water transport as those incorporated into a tetramer (3.Horner A. Zocher F. Preiner J. Ollinger N. Siligan C. Akimov S.A. Pohl P. The mobility of single-file water molecules is governed by the number of H-bonds they may form with channel-lining residues.Sci. Adv. 2015; 1: e1400083Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore it is not clear why AQPs retain this tetrameric structure. Regulation of AQP function by the formation of heterotetramers has been suggested for some plant AQPs (4.Chevalier A.S. Chaumont F. Trafficking of plant plasma membrane aquaporins: multiple regulation levels and complex sorting signals.Plant Cell Physiol. 2015; 56: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fifth, central pore formed at the 4-fold axis of the tetramer has also been suggested to transport carbon dioxide (5.Kaldenhoff R. Kai L. Uehlein N. Aquaporins and membrane diffusion of CO2 in living organisms.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840: 1592-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and cations (6.Yu J. Yool A.J. Schulten K.

Trigger-induced relocalization of AQP-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane is a well established regulatory mechanism for AQPs; the best studied example of this is relocalization of AQP2 to the apical membrane of the collecting duct in the mammalian kidney in response to arginine vasopressin (also called anti-diuretic hormone). There is also evidence for similar mechanisms for other AQPs including AQP1 (7.Conner M.T. Conner A.C. Bland C.E. Taylor L.H. Brown J.E. Parri H.R. Bill R.M.

A naturally occurring AQP2 mutant (R187C) has also been reported that is unable to relocalize in response to arginine vasopressin or to form tetramers (10.Kamsteeg E.J. Wormhoudt T.A.

Given the ubiquity of these regulatory responses across the AQP family and the conservation of the tetrameric quaternary structure, it may be that these trigger-induced relocalization responses involve interaction with proteins that only recognize the tetrameric form of AQPs. aquaporin Forster resonant energy transfer fluorescence recovery after photobleaching transmembrane domain Madin-Darby canine kidney cells blue native-PAGE 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine analysis of variance. Here we demonstrate that intracellular loop D of AQP4 forms vital homomeric interactions between AQP subunits that stabilize the tetrameric quaternary structure. We also show that loss of tetramerization does not affect single channel water permeability. Our data suggest that tetramerization is not required for AQP4 to be trafficked through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to the plasma membrane, but that unlike wild-type AQP4, the non-tetrameric mutants are unable to relocalize to the plasma membrane in response to changes in local osmolality. Finally, based on loss and gain of oligomerization mutants of AQP1 and AQP3, we suggest that loop D-mediated inter-monomer interactions may control formation of the signature quaternary structure of the family. Human AQP4 cDNA cloned into pDEST47 (Life Technologies) was used as previously described (11.Kitchen P. Day R.E. Taylor L.H. Salman M.M. Bill R.M. Conner M.T. Conner A.C.

An untagged AQP4 construct was created from this by mutagenesis of the first two codons of the GFP linker peptide to stop codons. These were used as templates for mutagenesis following the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers were synthesized by Sigma. Mutant plasmids were amplified in TOP10 Escherichia coli with 100 ng/ml of ampicillin selection. Plasmid DNA was purified using a Wizard Maxiprep kit (Promega) and diluted to 1 mg/ml for transfection. HEK293 cells were cultured routinely in DMEM with l-glutamine (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and without antibiotics in humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 in air at 37 °C. Cells were seeded into either tissue culture treated 6-well plates (Falcon) for Blue Native (BN)-PAGE and biotinylation or 35-mm FluoroDishesTM (World Precision Instruments) for confocal microscopy. Cells were transfected (at 50% confluence) using polyethyleneimine (branched, average Mr ∼25,000, Sigma) as previously described (11.Kitchen P. Day R.E. Taylor L.H. Salman M.M. Bill R.M. Conner M.T.

Stable transfections were done using the neomycin resistance gene on the pDEST47 vector. Cells were transiently transfected as described above, then trypsinized and serially diluted into tissue culture plates after 24 h. Cells were treated with 700 μg/ml of G418 antibiotic for 2 weeks, with medium replaced every third day. GFP-expressing resistant colonies were picked using cloning cylinders (Sigma) and serially diluted. The lowest dilution that grew to confluence was used to generate a stable cell line. Cellular protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as previously described (11.Kitchen P. Day R.E. Taylor L.H. Salman M.M. Bill R.M. Conner M.T. Conner A.C.

No endogenous AQP4 was detected in Western blots. Reduced G418 pressure (300 μg/ml) was used to maintain the stable cell lines after colony isolation. All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma using the EZ-PCR test kit (Biological Industries), and all data reported are from cells that tested negative. HEK293 and MDCK cells both expressed only the M1 isoform of AQP4 from the wild-type AQP4 construct. This was confirmed by Western blotting comparing the wild-type construct to AQP4 constructs in which either the M1 or M23 translation initiation sites were removed, as previously described (11.Kitchen P.

AQP4-GFP constructs were imaged in live HEK293 cells using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with a ×63 1.4 NA oil immersion objective. GFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon laser, Venus using the 514-nm line and mTurquoise2 using a 405-nm diode laser. Hypotonic exposure was performed by adding 3 ml of ddH2O to cells in 1 ml of growth medium (280 to 70 mosmol/kg of H2O). Line profiles across the cell membrane and cytoplasm were extracted using ImageJ as previously described (7.Conner M.T. Conner A.C. Bland C.E. Taylor L.H. Brown J.E. Parri H.R. Bill R.M.

Relative membrane expression was calculated from these profiles (3 profiles per cell and at least 3 cells per image) using in-house Matlab code. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was done using a circular bleaching 1-μm area of radius. Recovery curves were fitted to a single phase exponential recovery function and diffusion coefficients were calculated using the approach and equations of Kang et al. (12.Kang M. Day C.A. Kenworthy A.K. DiBenedetto E. Simplified equation to extract diffusion coefficients from confocal FRAP data.Traffic. 2012; 13: 1589-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).

FRET experiments were done using the sensitized emission methodology with the FRET signal corrected for donor emission in the acceptor channel and direct excitation of the acceptor, following van Rheenen et al. (13.van Rheenen J. Langeslag M. Jalink K. Correcting confocal acquisition to optimize imaging of fluorescence resonance energy transfer by sensitized emission.Biophys.

The contrast of some images in the figures was adjusted manually using ImageJ to aid the eye. All analysis was performed on raw, unadjusted images. Cell surface amines were biotinylated using an amine-reactive biotinylation reagent that is not cell permeable (Thermo number 21328, EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin), and surface AQPs were detected using a neutravidin-based ELISA as previously described (11.Kitchen P.

Transfected cells were lysed in ice-cold BN lysis buffer (1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm bis-tris, 500 mm aminohexanoic acid, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 250 μl/well). The lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was collected and diluted 10-fold in Triton lysis buffer. 8% bis-tris-buffered polyacrylamide gels (0.75 mm) at pH 7.0 containing 66 mm aminohexanoic acid were used. Wells were topped up with cathode buffer (50 mm Tricine, 15 mm bis-tris, 0.02% (w/v) Coomassie G-250, pH 7.0). 10 μg of BSA was used as a molecular mass marker, giving bands at 66 and 132 kDa. Gels were run on ice at 100 V until samples entered the gel, then at 180 V until the Coomassie dye front reached the end of the gel. BN-PAGE gels were destained with 40% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid for 30 min, refreshing the destaining solution every 10 min. Gels were soaked for 30 min in 1% SDS in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at room temperature. Proteins were blotted onto PVDF membrane by wet transfer at 100 V for 1 h. Coomassie-stained BSA marker bands were marked onto the membrane using a felt-tipped pen. Membranes were blocked in 20% (w/v) Marvel-skimmed milk powder in 0.1% PBS-Tween for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a roller in rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody (Abcam, ab128906) diluted 1:5,000 or rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam, ab6556) diluted 1:10,000, both in 5 ml of 0.1% PBS-Tween.

The AQP4 tetramer was embedded into 5 pre-equilibrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers using inflateGRO (18.Schmidt T.H. Kandt C.

Model. 2012; 52: 2657-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and hydrated using Gromacs. Na+ and Cl− were added to a final concentration of 100 mm. Equilibration was achieved by steepest gradient energy minimization, 100-ps NPT simulation with 1,000 kJmol−1 nm−1 restraints on protein heavy atoms followed by three 1-ns NVT simulations with 1000, 100, and 10 kJmol−1 nm−1 restraints on protein heavy atoms followed by 30-ns unrestrained simulation. A Nosé-Hoover thermostat (0.5 ps, 310 K) was used to maintain constant temperature and 2 Parinello-Rahmann barostats (2 ps, 1 atm) were used to maintain constant pressure with zero surface tension. 1.4-nm cut-offs were applied for dispersion and short-range electrostatic interactions. Long-range electrostatics were treated using particle mesh Ewald. Hydrogen bonds were identified using the H-bonds plugin of visual molecular dynamics (19.Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. VMD: visual molecular dynamics.J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (27–38): 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (38403) Google Scholar) using 3 Å and 20° cut-offs. Hydrogen bond occupancy was calculated according to these cut-offs at 100-ps intervals along the 100-ns trajectories and averaged over the 4 monomers and 5 trajectories. Plate reader-based calcein fluorescence quenching was done following Fenton et al. (20.Fenton R.A. Moeller H.B. Nielsen S. de Groot B.L. Rützler M. A plate reader-based method for cell water permeability measurement.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2010; 298: F224-F230Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were plated into black-walled, clear-bottomed tissue culture treated 96-well plates (Greiner) at 50% confluence 24 h before the experiment. Cells were loaded with 5 μm calcein-AM in growth medium supplemented with 1 mm probenecid (to inhibit dye leakage) for 90 min. Cells were washed twice with HEPES-buffered growth medium supplemented with 1 mm probenecid, then covered with 75 μl of probenecid-supplemented HEPES-buffered medium. Fluorescence was read on a BioTek synergy HT plate reader with injector system. Each well was read continuously (dt = 50 ms) for 5 s, followed by injection of 75 μl of HEPES-buffered medium containing 400 mm mannitol to give a final concentration of 200 mm and an osmotic gradient of 200 mosmol. Fluorescence was read for a further 50 s. Normalized fluorescence values were converted to normalized volumes using a Coulter counter generated standard curve. Single-phase exponential decay functions were fitted and rate constants were taken as proportional to the membrane water permeability. Using the crystal structure of AQP4 (17.Ho J.D. Yeh R. Sandstrom A. Chorny I. Harries W.E. Robbins R.A. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Crystal structure of human aquaporin 4 at 1.8 Å and its mechanism of conductance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7437-7442Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), residues likely to form the tetrameric interface were identified, based on the physical distance between residues on adjacent monomers. Alanine substitution mutagenesis was used to investigate the contribution of these residues to oligomeric assembly. The identified residues were clustered into two regions. The first cluster comprises a patch of hydrophobic residues at the interfaces of TM1 and TM2 of one monomer with TM4 and TM5 of the adjacent monomer (Fig. 1A); the second cluster comprises 12 predominantly polar and charged residues forming intracellular loop D and the bottom of TM2 (Fig. 1B). 24 single point alanine-substitution mutants were made and six compound mutants were used to investigate the possibility of synergistic effects of several residues. There are two protein kinase A/C consensus sites in loop D (Ser180 and Ser188) so phosphomimetic mutations were also made (S180D and S188D). All mutants are listed in the left-hand column of Table 1. BN-PAGE followed by immunoblotting was used to assess the oligomeric state of all mutants expressed in HEK293 cells. Representative BN blots are shown in Fig. 2A and the effect of all mutations on oligomeric assembly and surface expression summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2B. None of the hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic patches had any effect on tetramer formation, either in isolation or in compound mutants. TM compound mutants consisted of simultaneous mutations of all residues identified within that transmembrane segment (e.g. TM1 denotes the simultaneous mutations I43A/I47A/L50A/L51A/I57A). Of the loop D single alanine mutants, only D179A had an effect on oligomeric assembly in isolation, and this effect was only minimal, with 95 ± 2% of the protein still assembled into tetramers. Unlike the hydrophobic cluster, the compound mutants of loop D had a clear effect on the ability of AQP4 to tetramerize. The two compound mutants, loop D1 (D179A/S180A/K181A/R182A/T183A) and loop D2 (D184A/V185A/T186A/G187A/S188A), caused reductions in oligomeric assembly: only 19 ± 4% of the loop D1 protein assembled into tetramers with both dimers (27 ± 5%) and monomers (53 ± 4%) being present, whereas the loop D2 protein predominantly formed dimers (67 ± 7%) with 33 ± 7% assembled into tetramers (n = 3).TABLE 1Oligomerization state and surface expression of AQP4 mutantsMutantOligomerization stateSurface expression% of WTI43AT113.9 ± 5.1I47AT95.8 ± 3.2L50AT102.5 ± 4.1L51AT96.1 ± 13.0I57AT104.1 ± 4.1TM1 (I43A/I47A/L50A/L51A/I57A)T86.9 ± 3.1L72AT121.1 ± 25.6L79AT88.9 ± 13.3TM2 (L72A/L79A)T97.7 ± 5.6L161AT91.9 ± 18.4I165AT87.9 ± 3.6TM4 (L161A/I165A)T85.4 ± 11.2I189AT97.7 ± 5.9I199AT96.2 ± 8.5F203AT112.4 ± 13.3TM5 (I189A/I199A/F203A)T93.3 ± 9.0Q86AT118 ± 4.4H90AT113.5 ± 4.1D179AT (95 ± 2%)87.6 ± 19.4D (5 ± 2%)S180AT109.8 ± 4.5S180DT99.7 ± 4.9K181AT103.2 ± 4.5R182AT96.1 ± 22.1T183T105.6 ± 3.6Loop D1 (D179A/S180A/K181A/R182A/T183A)T (19 ± 4%)88.5 ± 6.1D (27 ± 5%)M (53 ± 4%)D184AT97.7 ± 8.8V185AT102.2 ± 5.4T186AT95.1 ± 7.5G187AT106.7 ± 5.1S188AT98.6 ± 3.2S188DT104.1 ± 4.2Loop D2 (D184A/V185A/T186A/G187A/S188A)T (33 ± 7%)83.1 ± 11.0D (67 ± 7%) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2.BN-PAGE and Western blotting of AQP4 mutants.

Surface expression was assessed qualitatively by live cell confocal microscopy using GFP-tagged AQP4 mutant constructs and quantitatively by cell surface biotinylation. Fig. 3A shows representative confocal micrographs of HEK293 cells transfected with GFP fusion proteins of AQP4 wild-type, and the loop D1 and loop D2 mutants. Surface expression in transiently transfected HEK293 cells measured by cell surface biotinylation was not significantly different (p = 0.53, one-way ANOVA, n = 3) for either of the loop D compound mutants (D1 and D2) or the single alanine mutants (Fig. 3B). This suggests that the trafficking machinery is able to interact with non-tetrameric aquaporins. The cell surface biotinylation data are summarized for all mutants in the third column of Table 1. It was important to confirm the reduction in tetramerization of AQP4 molecules that had been constitutively trafficked to the cell surface and to rule out intracellular retention of dimeric/monomeric species or changes in detergent sensitivity caused by loop D substitutions. Several complementary biophysical techniques were used to address this. Recovery curves were collected from 5 different cells per experimental repeat (n = 6). Representative fluorescence recovery curves are shown in Fig. 3D, along with the average recovery half-times. From these, diffusion coefficients were calculated: 5.2 ± 0.3 × 10−3 μm2 s−1 (AQP4 WT), 5.9 ± 0.3 × 10−3 μm2 s−1 (loop D1), and 5.8 ± 0.2 × 10−3 μm2 s−1 (loop D2). Both loop D mutant diffusion coefficients were significantly different from the wild-type (D1 p = 0.01 and D2 p = 0.02 by Student's t test following ANOVA, with p values subjected to Bonferroni correction). The FRAP data suggest reduced tetramerization for the surface-localized loop D mutants, although the increased diffusion coefficient could also be explained by the inability of these mutants to form a complex with a third party protein. To complement these FRAP experiments, biotinylated cell surface proteins were isolated using neutravidin-coated plates, eluted by reducing the S-S bond incorporated into the biotinylation reagent (using 1% β-mercaptoethanol in BN lysis buffer) and subjected to BN-PAGE (representative blots are shown in Fig. 3C). Surface-localized mutant AQP4 molecules subjected to BN-PAGE had the same changes in tetramerization seen in whole cell lysates (n = 3). To complement the above analyses, AQP4 constructs tagged with Venus (a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) derivative) and mTurquoise2 (a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) derivative) were generated and co-transfected into HEK293 cells to form a FRET biosensor for homo-oligomerization in living cells. The wild-type AQP4 constructs gave a robust FRET signal with an average apparent efficiency of 44.2 ± 3.6% (Fig. 4). We were unable to measure any FRET in cells co-transfected with AQP1-Venus and AQP4-Turquoise despite high co-localization (data not shown), suggesting that the FRET interactions occur primarily within the AQP4 tetramers and not between tetramers that are transiently close together in the plane of the membrane. The probability of a particular donor molecule taking part in FRET is dependent on the number of acceptors within the Forster radius and vice versa. For CFP-YFP, the Forster radius is ∼5 nm (21.Felber L.M. Cloutier S.M. Kündig C. Kishi T. Brossard V. Jichlinski P. Leisinger H.J. Deperthes D. Evaluation of the CFP-substrate-YFP system for protease studies: advantages and limitations.BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 878-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the AQP4 crystal structure, the monomer-monomer center of mass separations are 2.8 (adjacent monomers) and 3.9 nm (diagonal monomers), respectively, so both would be expected to contribute to the FRET signal (assuming that the average separation of the C-terminal tails is similar). The average number of FRET pairings in a sample of co-transfected cells is therefore dependent on the level of AQP4 oligomerization. Both D1 and D2 compound mutants had a slightly larger than 2-fold reduction in FRET efficiency (to 17 ± 6 and 20 ± 4%, respectively, p = 0.003 and p = 0.005, n = 4) compared with the wild-type (Fig. 5A), suggesting that these constructs have a reduced propensity to oligomerize in live cells, further confirming that the changes seen in the BN-PAGE were not mediated by changes in detergent sensitivity. Furthermore, for the mutants, there was no difference in FRET efficiency between plasma membrane and intracellular membranes (Figs. 5, B and C), suggesting that the oligomerization state of these m"
https://openalex.org/W2412049582,"A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant for the treatment of major depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the actions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not fully understood. In the dentate gyrus, chronic fluoxetine treatment induces increased excitability of mature granule cells (GCs) as well as neurogenesis. The major input to the dentate gyrus is the perforant path axons (boutons) from the entorhinal cortex (layer II). Through voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we found that the excitatory neurotransmission of the perforant path synapse onto the GCs in the middle molecular layer of the mouse dentate gyrus (perforant path-GC synapse) is enhanced after chronic fluoxetine treatment (15 mg/kg/day, 14 days). Therefore, we further examined whether chronic fluoxetine treatment affects the morphology of the perforant path-GC synapse, using FIB/SEM (focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy). A three-dimensional reconstruction of dendritic spines revealed the appearance of extremely large-sized spines after chronic fluoxetine treatment. The large-sized spines had a postsynaptic density with a large volume. However, chronic fluoxetine treatment did not affect spine density. The presynaptic boutons that were in contact with the large-sized spines were large in volume, and the volumes of the mitochondria and synaptic vesicles inside the boutons were correlated with the size of the boutons. Thus, the large-sized perforant path-GC synapse induced by chronic fluoxetine treatment contains synaptic components that correlate with the synapse size and that may be involved in enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission."

https://openalex.org/W2271076325,"Synthetic peptide vaccines provide the advantages of safety, stability and low cost. The success of this approach is highly dependent on efficient epitope identification and synthetic strategies for efficacious delivery. In malaria, the Merozoite Surface Protein-9 of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP9) has been considered a vaccine candidate based on the evidence that specific antibodies were able to inhibit merozoite invasion and recombinant proteins were highly immunogenic in mice and humans. However the identities of linear B-cell epitopes within PvMSP9 as targets of functional antibodies remain undefined. We used several publicly-available algorithms for in silico analyses and prediction of relevant B cell epitopes within PMSP9. We show that the tandem repeat sequence EAAPENAEPVHENA (PvMSP9E795-A808) present at the C-terminal region is a promising target for antibodies, given its high combined score to be a linear epitope and located in a putative intrinsically unstructured region of the native protein. To confirm the predictive value of the computational approach, plasma samples from 545 naturally exposed individuals were screened for IgG reactivity against the recombinant PvMSP9-RIRII729-972 and a synthetic peptide representing the predicted B cell epitope PvMSP9E795-A808. 316 individuals (58%) were responders to the full repetitive region PvMSP9-RIRII, of which 177 (56%) also presented total IgG reactivity against the synthetic peptide, confirming it validity as a B cell epitope. The reactivity indexes of anti-PvMSP9-RIRII and anti-PvMSP9E795-A808 antibodies were correlated. Interestingly, a potential role in the acquisition of protective immunity was associated with the linear epitope, since the IgG1 subclass against PvMSP9E795-A808 was the prevalent subclass and this directly correlated with time elapsed since the last malaria episode; however this was not observed in the antibody responses against the full PvMSP9-RIRII. In conclusion, our findings identified and experimentally confirmed the potential of PvMSP9E795-A808 as an immunogenic linear B cell epitope within the P. vivax malaria vaccine candidate PvMSP9 and support its inclusion in future subunit vaccines."

Such suppression transpires through a transcriptional mechanism, predominantly at the proximal serum response element of the c-fos promoter. We show that androgen signaling suppresses TPA-induced c-Fos expression through repressing a PKC/MEK/ERK/ELK-1 signaling pathway. Moreover, our results support the hypothesis that p38MAPK, PI3K, and PKCδ are involved in the androgenic regulation of c-Fos through controlling MEK/ERK. Stable silencing of c-Fos and PKCδ with shRNAs suggests that R1881 promotes cell death induced by low-dose TPA through a mechanism that is dependent on both PKCδ and loss of c-Fos expression. Reciprocally, loss of either PKCδ or c-Fos activates p38MAPK while suppressing the activation of ERK1/2. We also provide the first demonstration that R1881 permits cell death induced by low-dose TPA in the LNCaP androgen-dependent PCa cell line and that TPA-induced cell death is independent of exogenous androgen in the castration-resistant variants of LNCaP, C4-2 and C4-2B. Acquisition of androgen-independent killing by TPA correlates with activation of p38MAPK, suppression of ERK1/2, and loss of c-Fos.

https://openalex.org/W2255019371,"Objectives The current study compared the effects of high-intensity aerobic training (HIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) on mountain biking (MTB) race simulation performance and physiological variables, including peak power output (PPO), lactate threshold (LT) and onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). Methods Sixteen mountain bikers (mean ± SD: age 32.1 ± 6.4 yr, body mass 69.2 ± 5.3 kg and VO2max 63.4 ± 4.5 mL∙kg-1∙min-1) completed graded exercise and MTB performance tests before and after six weeks of training. The HIT (7–10 x [4–6 min—highest sustainable intensity / 4–6 min—CR100 10–15]) and SIT (8–12 x [30 s—all-out intensity / 4 min—CR100 10–15]) protocols were included in the participants’ regular training programs three times per week. Results Post-training analysis showed no significant differences between training modalities (HIT vs. SIT) in body mass, PPO, LT or OBLA (p = 0.30 to 0.94). The Cohen’s d effect size (ES) showed trivial to small effects on group factor (p = 0.00 to 0.56). The interaction between MTB race time and training modality was almost significant (p = 0.08), with a smaller ES in HIT vs. SIT training (ES = -0.43). A time main effect (pre- vs. post-phases) was observed in MTB race performance and in several physiological variables (p = 0.001 to 0.046). Co-variance analysis revealed that the HIT (p = 0.043) group had significantly better MTB race performance measures than the SIT group. Furthermore, magnitude-based inferences showed HIT to be of likely greater benefit (83.5%) with a lower probability of harmful effects (0.8%) compared to SIT. Conclusion The results of the current study suggest that six weeks of either HIT or SIT may be effective at increasing MTB race performance; however, HIT may be a preferable strategy.

MPSS administration was the standard of care for acute SCI until recently when its use has become controversial. Patients with SCI have had little input in the debate, thus we sought to learn their opinions regarding administration of MPSS. A summary of the published literature to date on MPSS use for acute SCI was created and adjudicated by 28 SCI experts. This summary was then emailed to 384 chronic SCI patients along with a survey that interrogated the patients’ neurological deficits, communication with physicians and their views on MPSS administration. 77 out of 384 patients completed the survey. 28 respondents indicated being able to speak early after injury and of these 24 reported arriving at the hospital within 8 hours of injury. One recalled a physician speaking to them about MPSS and one patient reported choosing whether or not to receive MPSS. 59.4% felt that the small neurological benefits associated with MPSS were ‘very important’ to them (p<0.0001). Patients had ‘little concern’ for potential side-effects of MPSS (p = 0.001). Only 1.4% felt that MPSS should not be given to SCI patients regardless of degree of injury (p<0.0001). This is the first study to report SCI patients’ preferences regarding MPSS treatment for acute SCI. Patients favor the administration of MPSS for acute SCI, however few had input into whether or not it was administered. Conscious patients should be given greater opportunity to decide their treatment. These results also provide some guidance regarding MPSS administration in patients unable to communicate."
https://openalex.org/W2255064035,"Establishing nature reserves protects species from land cover conversion and the resulting loss of habitat. Even within a reserve, however, many factors such as fires and defoliating insects still threaten habitat and the survival of species. To address the risk to species survival after reserve establishment, reserve networks can be created that allow some redundancy of species coverage to maximize the expected number of species that survive in the presence of threats. In some regions, however, the threats to species within a reserve may be spatially correlated. As examples, fires, diseases, and pest infestations can spread from a starting point and threaten neighboring parcels’ habitats, in addition to damage caused at the initial location. This paper develops a reserve site selection optimization framework that compares the optimal reserve networks in cases where risks do and do not reflect spatial correlation. By exploring the impact of spatially-correlated risk on reserve networks on a stylized landscape and on an Oregon landscape, this analysis demonstrates an appropriate and feasible method for incorporating such post-reserve establishment risks in the reserve site selection literature as an additional tool to be further developed for future conservation planning."

Thus, NEMO-dependent signaling is essential for normal thyroid physiology.

Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Two distinct pathways of NF-κB activation have been reported. The classical, canonical pathway is found in virtually all mammalian cells and depends on the presence of the IKKγ/NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) 3The abbreviations used are: NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; IKK, I-κB kinase; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone; HED-ID, hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein. protein (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). In this pathway, NF-κB activation is mediated by the IKK complex, consisting of the IKK1/IKKα and IKK2/IKKβ catalytic kinase subunits and the NEMO regulatory protein (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). Basically, NF-κB transcription factors are kept inactive in the cytoplasm through binding to members of the I-κB family of inhibitory proteins. Cell activation by a variety of stimuli results in the IKK-dependent phosphorylation of I-κB proteins, followed by their polyubiquitination and their proteasome-dependent degradation, allowing NF-κB dimers to enter the nucleus and catalyze transcription of target genes (1Vallabhapurapu S. Karin M. Regulation and function of NF-κB transcription factors in the immune system.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 693-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). In specific lymphoid tissues cells, an alternative, non-canonical pathway has been described that relies on IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of I-κB molecules.

The evidence that NEMO-deficient mice exhibit a phenotype similar to that of p65/RELA-deficient mice demonstrates the essential role of NEMO in the canonical NF-κB signaling. Experiments based on tissue- and/or organ-specific deletion of NEMO, obtained through Cre-mediated genetic recombination, have given diverse results regarding the physiological role of this protein. In fact, ablation of NEMO in liver parenchymal cells causes spontaneous development of steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (13Luedde T. Beraza N. Kotsikoris V. van Loo G. Nenci A. De Vos R. Roskams T. Trautwein C. Pasparakis M. Deletion of NEMO/IKKγ in liver parenchymal cells causes steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 119-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Instead, intestinal epithelial cell-specific deletion of NEMO results in severe chronic intestinal inflammation due to apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells, impaired expression of antimicrobial peptides, and translocation of bacteria into the mucosa (14Nenci A. Becker C. Wullaert A. Gareus R. van Loo G. Danese S. Huth M. Nikolaev A. Neufert C. Madison B. Gumucio D. Neurath M.F. Pasparakis M. Epithelial NEMO links innate immunity to chronic intestinal inflammation.Nature. 2007; 446: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Central nervous system-specific ablation of NEMO results in no apparent abnormalities but rather ameliorates inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies (15van Loo G. De Lorenzi R. Schmidt H. Huth M. Mildner A. Schmidt-Supprian M. Lassmann H. Prinz M.R. Pasparakis M. Inhibition of transcription factor NF-κB in the central nervous system ameliorates autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). NEMO inactivation in the heart did not affect embryonic cardiac development but led to spontaneous and progressive impairment of cardiac function, progression to dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart failure (16Kratsios P. Huth M. Temmerman L. Salimova E. Al Banchaabouchi M. Sgoifo A. Manghi M. Suzuki K. Rosenthal N. Mourkioti F. Antioxidant amelioration of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by conditional deletion of NEMO/IKKγ in cardiomyocytes.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, genetic abrogation of NEMO in podocytes did not affect normal glomerular development and function under non-stressed conditions (17Brähler S. Ising C. Hagmann H. Rasmus M. Hoehne M. Kurschat C. Kisner T. Goebel H. Shankland S. Addicks K. Thaiss F. Schermer B. Pasparakis M. Benzing T. Brinkkoetter P.T. Intrinsic proinflammatory signaling in podocytes contributes to podocyte damage and prolonged proteinuria.Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2012; 303: F1473-F1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that canonical NF-κB signaling performs different roles and functions, depending on the type of tissue and organ. In the present work, we have investigated the requirement for NEMO in thyroid development, differentiation, and function by generating a mouse model bearing a thyroid-specific genetic inactivation of NEMO. In these mice, development and differentiation of the thyroid gland appears normal. In contrast, after birth, thyroid-specific NEMO knock-out mice develop progressive loss of thyroid cellularity and thyroid markers, hypothyroidism, and reduced vitality due to extensive apoptosis of thyroid cells. Thus, our data indicate that NF-κB-dependent gene expression is essential for maintaining normal thyroid gland structure and function in the adult. Procedures involving animals were conducted as indicated in the Italian National Guidelines (D.L. 100/2006 and D.L. 116/1992) and in the pertinent European Directives (EEC Council Directive 86/609, 1.12.1987), adhering to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (United States National Research Council). All of the in vivo experimental activities were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Biogem (Italy) with ID number 4713. To inactivate the NEMO gene in thyroid, mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of endogenous Pax8 promoter (18Bouchard M. Souabni A. Busslinger M. Tissue-specific expression of Cre recombinase from the Pax8 locus.Genesis. 2004; 38: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and NEMOFlox/+ (12Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israël A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. NEMO/IKKγ-deficient mice model incontinentia pigmenti.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were bred. NEMOFlox/Y/Pax8Cre/+ mice were named NEMOTS-KO and used as the experimental group, whereas NEMO+/Y/Pax8Cre/+ littermates were used as controls. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of a tail biopsy. All experiments were conducted on age- and gender-matched animals. Renal parameters were evaluated in 12-month-old mice using metabolic cages as described previously (19Iervolino A. Trepiccione F. Petrillo F. Spagnuolo M. Scarfò M. Frezzetti D. De Vita G. De Felice M. Capasso G. Selective dicer suppression in the kidney alters GSK3β/β-catenin pathways promoting a glomerulocystic disease.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0119142Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mice were housed individually in metabolic cages for 5 days at 23 °C with a 12-h dark/light cycle. After 4 days of adjustment, parameters were registered on day 5. 24-h urine output was collected under mineral oil to prevent evaporation. Proteinuria was quantified by a Bradford assay, and urinary electrolytes and creatinine were evaluated using Vitrovet (Scil). Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane and perfused through abdominal aorta with 4% paraformaldehyde. Blood, left kidney, and thyroid were collected before perfusion. The left kidney and one thyroid lobe were used for immunoblotting or PCR, whereas the right kidney and the other thyroid lobe were used for immunohistochemistry. After embedding in paraffin, 4-μm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) or with Masson's trichrome kit (Bio-Optica). For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated overnight in xylene and then progressively in ethanol solution (99-96-70%). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 35% H2O2 in methanol, and target retrieval was performed in TEG buffer, pH 9.2. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C, and sections were then incubated with secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Dako). Chromogenic reactions were carried out with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories), and stained sections were mounted with Eukitt (Bio-Optica). For immunofluorescence analysis, thyroid sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-NIS antibody (kindly provided by Prof. M. De Felice). Sections were then incubated with secondary anti-rabbit-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488; DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. The primary antibodies used for kidney staining were as follows: anti-AQP2 and anti-NKCC2 provided by Prof. Frische; anti-Pax8, anti-TITF1, and anti-thyroglobulin provided by Prof. De Felice; and anti-cleaved caspase-3 purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. A Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope was used for image acquisition. All stainings were done at least three times using different biological material as sources. Tissues were homogenized with a TissueLyser (Qiagen) in lysis buffer (300 mm sucrose, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblottings were performed as described previously (20Stilo R. Liguoro D. di Jeso B. Leonardi A. Vito P. The α-chain of the nascent polypeptide- associated complex binds to and regulates FADD function.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-NEMO, anti-IKKα/β, anti-p65, anti-p50, anti-phospho-CREB, anti-CREB, anti-caspase-3, and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. All immunoblots were done at least three times using different biological material as sources. 1 μg of total RNA was isolated from a pool of three thyroid lobes using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using the Quantitec reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR mixtures contained 7.5 ng of total cDNA, Power PCR Master Mix 16 (Applied Biosystems), and the following primers: Pax8, GCCATGGCTGTGTAAGCAAGA (forward) and GCTTGGAGCCCCCTATCACT (reverse); Titf1, CTACTGCAACGGCAACCTG (forward) and CCCATGCCATCATATATTCAT (reverse); Tg, CATGGAATCTAATGCCAAGAACTG (forward) and TCCCTGTGAGCTTTTGGAATG (reverse); Tpo, CAAAGGCTGGAACCCTAATTTCT (forward) and AACTTGAATGAGGTGCCTTGTCA (reverse); Nis, TCCACAGGAATCATCTGCA (forward) and CCACGGCCTTCATACCACC (reverse); Gapdh, AATGGTGAAGGTCGGTGTG (forward) and GAAGATGGTGATGGGCTTCC (reverse); c-Flip, CCGTGAAGAGACTTACAGGA (forward) and GTTATGTCATGTGACTTGGG (reverse); Bcl-2, GGGGTCATGTGTGTGGAGAG (forward) and GCATGCTGGGGCCATATAGT (reverse); Bfl-1/A1, TGCCCTGGATGTATGTGCTT (forward) and GAGCATTTCCCAGATCTGTC (reverse); Bcl-xL, CCTTGGATCCAGGAGAACGG (forward) and AAGAGTGAGCCCAGCAGAAC (reverse); c-Iap2, AGAGAGGAGCAGATGGAGCA (forward) and CCTGTTCAGTGATGGCCCTT (reverse); c-Iap1, GACCCCTGGATAGAACACGC (forward) and CTGGGGTGTCTGAAGTGGAC (reverse); Xiap, GGAACATGGACATCCTCAGT (forward) and TACCACTTCGCATGCTGTTC (reverse); RNA18S, CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA (forward) and GGGCCTCGAAAGAGTCCTGT (reverse). Reactions were run on a 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems). For each sample, expression of the genes of interest was normalized to the expression of RNA18S and/or Gapdh measured under the same conditions (21D'Andrea E.L. Ferravante A. Scudiero I. Zotti T. Reale C. Pizzulo M. De La Motte L.R. De Maio C. Mazzone P. Telesio G. Vito P. Stilo R.

Mice of different genotypes were anesthetized and sacrificed. Thyroid lobes were dissected aseptically and placed on a microscope slide containing a drop of Eagle's minimum essential medium. The lobes were disrupted mechanically, using two 25-gauge needles to obtain approximately 10 fragments from each lobe. The fragments were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube containing 1 ml of digestion medium, consisting of 112 units/ml type I collagenase (Sigma) and 1.2 units/ml dispase dissolved in Eagle's minimum essential medium. The enzymatic digestion was carried out for 45 min in a 37 °C water bath. The follicles were seeded and cultured in F-12 medium (EuroClone) supplemented with 10% Nu-Serum IV (BD Biosciences), 10 ng/ml somatostatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 ng/ml glycyl-l-histidyl-lysine acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) in a water-saturated incubator, under 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and TNFα used for thyrocyte stimulation were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Venous blood samples were collected in microtubes without anticoagulant. After clot formation, samples were centrifuged, and the serum fraction was kept at −80 °C. Free T4 was measured using the ELISA kit from DiaMetra according to the manufacturer's instructions. TSH levels were determined by a rat TSH radioimmunoassay kit (Institute of Isotopes, Budapest, Hungary). A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay for cell viability was performed in a 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates as described previously (22Scudiero I. Zotti T. Ferravante A. Vessichelli M. Vito P. Stilo R. Alternative splicing of CARMA2/CARD14 transcripts generates protein variants with differential effect on NF-κB activation and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced cell death.J. Cell. Physiol. 2011; 226: 3121-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed by Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. In order to understand the role of NEMO in thyroid development and function, we applied the Cre-LoxP strategy to specifically delete the NEMO locus in the thyroid gland. For this, females bearing a floxed Nemo allele (NemoFlox/+), which do not show phenotype abnormalities (12Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israël A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. NEMO/IKKγ-deficient mice model incontinentia pigmenti.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), were crossed to the knock-in Pax8Cre/+ mice, which express the Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Pax8 gene promoter and mediate efficient Cre recombination in thyroid (18Bouchard M. Souabni A. Busslinger M. Tissue-specific expression of Cre recombinase from the Pax8 locus.Genesis. 2004; 38: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Mutant mice were observed at the expected Mendelian frequency and were named NEMO thyroid-specific knock-out (NEMOTS-KO). As shown in Fig. 1A, site-specific recombination of the NEMO allele was observed only in NEMO floxed mice expressing the Cre recombinase. Efficient ablation of the NEMO locus was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis on whole-thyroid extracts (Fig. 1B). Functional inactivation of the IKK complex was demonstrated by lack of I-κBα degradation in NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes following exposure to TNFα (Fig. 1C, left). On the other hand, expression of p65, IKKα/β, and p50 were not affected by genetic deletion of NEMO (Fig. 1C, right). Because Pax8Cre/+ mice express Cre recombinase also in the mesonephros and metanephros (18Bouchard M. Souabni A. Busslinger M. Tissue-specific expression of Cre recombinase from the Pax8 locus.Genesis. 2004; 38: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), excision of the Nemo floxed allele was consistently detected also in kidney tissues (Fig. 1, D and E). NEMOTS-KO mutant mice appeared undistinguishable from control mice at birth (data not shown). In contrast, starting from 2 months of age, mutant mice developed clearly smaller than control littermates and displayed a significantly reduced body weight (Fig. 2A). NEMOTS-KO mice had a significantly shortened life span, and about 50% of mice die before 8 months of age (Fig. 2B). When compared with control mice, NEMOTS-KO mice presented significantly lower levels of serum-free T4 hormone (Fig. 2C) and increased TSH levels (Fig. 2D), which is indicative of hypothyroidism. Hence, body weight reduction and early lethality observed in these mice might be due, at least in part, to thyroid dysfunction. To exclude the possibility that the premature lethality observed in NEMOTS-KO mice was due to renal failure, we carried out a histological and functional analysis on the kidneys of the mutant mice. The result of this analysis, shown in Table 1, indicates that partial loss of NEMO expression in specific kidney tissues was not associated with an overt kidney phenotype. In fact, monitoring of the renal function in NEMOTS-KO mice did not reveal any physiological alteration (Table 1). Kidney histology was assessed by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry for the kidney-specific markers AQP2 and NKCC2. Again, no alteration in immunoreactivity for these markers was detected in NEMOTS-KO kidneys with respect to control mice at 12 months of age (Fig. 3, A–C). From these results, we deduced that NEMOTS-KO do not suffer of renal dysfunction. This conclusion is consistent with a previous observation showing that podocyte-specific NEMO-deficient mice do not show overt changes in kidney morphology and functionality (17Brähler S. Ising C. Hagmann H. Rasmus M. Hoehne M. Kurschat C. Kisner T. Goebel H. Shankland S. Addicks K. Thaiss F. Schermer B. Pasparakis M. Benzing T. Brinkkoetter P.T.

Souabni A. Busslinger M. Tissue-specific expression of Cre recombinase from the Pax8 locus.Genesis. 2004; 38: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At embryonic day 16.5, no alteration in thyroid size and morphology could be detected (Fig. 4A), and similar results were obtained when the same analysis was performed in mice at 1 month of age (Fig. 4A). Hence, these data indicate that canonical NF-κB signaling is not required for embryonic thyroid development and differentiation. The effect of NEMO conditional inactivation on thyroid morphology and differentiation was further analyzed. Starting from 2 months of age, thyroid glands of NEMOTS-KO mice appeared considerably smaller compared with controlmice (Fig. 4B). In the surviving 2-month-old NEMOTS-KO mice, significant cell loss was observed, and the thyroid follicular architecture appeared highly variable in diameter with irregular outlines (Fig. 4, B–F). Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis shows that the expression level of two thyroid-specific transcription factors, namely PAX8 and TTF1, steadily declined over time (Fig. 4, C and D). A similar decline occurred for thyroglobulin and for the Na/I symporter NIS (Fig. 4, E and F). NIS, for instance, appeared barely detectable in thyrocytes isolated from 2-month-old NEMOTS-KO mice (Fig. 4E). Masson's trichrome staining also revealed the presence of fibrotic material in mutant thyroids (Fig. 4G). In all staining, the progressive disorganization and degeneration of the thyroid parenchyma in NEMOTS-KO mutant mice was clearly visible. Also, reduction of cellularity and gland size in NEMOTS-KO mice was accompanied by massive apoptosis, as indicated by the staining for active caspase 3 (Fig. 4H). Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed the reduced expression of the thyroid markers PAX8, TTF1, TPO, and NIS in NEMO-deleted thyroids (Fig. 4I). The mRNA expression levels of TSH receptor and thyroglobulin were also both significantly reduced (Fig. 4I). Despite its reduced expression, however, TSH receptor signaling does not appear compromised in NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes, as assessed by monitoring phosphorylation of CREB following TSH stimulation (Fig. 4J). NF-κB controls the expression of several genes, including Bfl-1/A1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-Flip, and Iap, that protect cells against apoptotic cell death (23Zong W.X. Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J.

Consistently, all of these anti-apoptotic genes appear significantly down-regulated in NEMO-deficient thyrocytes (Fig. 5A). Thus, we verified whether NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes exhibit a greater sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. As shown in Fig. 5, B–E, lack of NEMO dramatically sensitizes these thyrocytes to the cytotoxic action of both TNFα and TSH. Taken together, these data demonstrate that in adult mice, NEMO is required for thyrocyte survival and contributes to the maintenance of thyrocyte differentiation by regulating the expression of several thyroid markers. In this paper, we demonstrate that NEMO signaling is essential for normal postnatal thyroid gland structure and function. Although previous studies have clearly established a role for NF-κB in thyroid tumor progression (30Visconti R. Cerutti J. Battista S. Fedele M. Trapasso F. Zeki K. Miano M.P. de Nigris F.

Leonardi A. Role of NF-κB in thyroid cancer.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2010; 321: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), this is the first work that examines the role of canonical NF-κB signaling in normal thyroid development and physiology. We show that mice with thyroid-specific ablation of NEMO develop a pronounced impairment of thyroid function, eventually leading to shortened life span. On the other hand, no gross alterations of thyroid gland localization, morphology, and differentiation were observed during embryonic development and in newborn mice, indicating that the NEMO-dependent NF-κB signaling is not required for embryonic thyroid development. Our results indicate that in thyroid, NEMO is required for at least two essential aspects: (i) thyrocyte survival and (ii) maintenance of thyroid marker expression. The critical role of NF-κB in cell survival is widely supported by the available literature. Gene-targeting experiments have in fact shown that mice lacking p65/RELA, IKK2, or NEMO die during embryonic development due to liver apoptosis (7Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

Thus, the extensive apoptosis observed in NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes confirms the requirement for NF-κB in orchestrating cytoprotective pathways. Particularly interesting are the data showing the different behavior of WT and NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes when exposed to TSH. In fact, whereas both wild type and NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes proliferate following TSH stimulation, NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes also undergo extensive apoptosis (Fig. 5). This finding is consistent with previous evidence showing that TSH stimulation on thyrocytes in fact triggers both proliferative and apoptotic responses (33De Gregorio G. Coppa A. Cosentino C. Ucci S. Messina S. Nicolussi A. D'Inzeo S. Di Pardo A. Avvedimento E.V. Porcellini A. The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K mediates TSH-cAMP-PKA growth and survival signals.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2039-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our work now shows that NF-κB signaling could play a decisive role in determining the fate of thyrocytes following TSH stimulation. An interesting aspect of our experiments is the evidence here provided that NF-κB controls, directly or indirectly, the expression level of several thyroid markers. Although an involvement of NF-κB in the regulation of Nis expression has been already reported (34Nicola J.P. Nazar M. Mascanfroni I.D. Pellizas C.G. Masini-Repiso A.M. NF-κB p65 subunit mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced Na+/I− symporter gene expression by involving functional interaction with the paired domain transcription factor Pax8.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 1846-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we now show that, in addition to NIS, NF-κB controls the expression of a panel of thyroid markers, including TTF1, PAX8, TPO, and thyroglobulin. In this context, our work provides a molecular explanation for some phenotypical aspects of human disorders associated with mutations in NEMO. In humans, in fact, mutations in the X-linked NEMO gene cause two distinct genetic diseases. Mutations that completely disrupt the NEMO locus result in Incontinentia Pigmenti, a disease where male patients die in utero, whereas the phenotypic analysis of females is complicated by the fact that NEMO-deficient cells quickly disappear and are replaced by wild-type cells. A second disease, named hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (HED-ID), is characterized by hypomorphic NEMO mutations that do not completely abolish but rather reduce NF-κB activation. HED-ID is characterized by impaired skin appendage development and severe immune deficiency. Strikingly, hypothyroidism is not uncommon in patients with HED-ID (35Fryns J.P. Chrzanowska K.

Congenital hypothyroidism with ectodermal dysplasia.Indian Pediatr. 1980; 17: 566PubMed Google Scholar), as predicted by the data we show here. In conclusion, our data can be easily interpreted considering the crucial role that NEMO plays in activation of NF-κB, which, in turn, regulates the expression of genes that are critical for cell survival. However, it should not be disregarded that NF-κB-independent functions have been ascribed to NEMO, and these latter are also involved in the control of cell proliferation and cell death (39Bettermann K.

Hence, it is very possible that NF-κB-independent functions of NEMO may contribute, at least in part, to the cellular degeneration observed in NEMOTS-KO thyrocytes. C. R., A. I., A. F., L. E. D.

https://openalex.org/W2275528056,"Caveolae are flask-shaped plasma membrane subdomains abundant in most cell types that participate in endocytosis. Caveola formation and functions require membrane proteins of the caveolin family, and cytoplasmic proteins of the cavin family. Cationic peptide dendrimers are non-vesicular chemical carriers that can transport pharmacological agents or genetic material across the plasma membrane. We prepared a panel of cationic dendrimers and investigated whether they require caveolae to enter into cells. Cell-based studies were performed using wild type or caveola-deficient i.e. caveolin-1 or PTRF gene-disrupted cells. There was a statistically significant difference in entry of cationic dendrimers between wild type and caveola-deficient cells. We further unveiled differences between dendrimers with varying charge density and head groups. Our results show, using a molecular approach, that (i) expression of caveola-forming proteins promotes cellular entry of cationic dendrimers and (ii) dendrimer structure can be modified to promote endocytosis in caveola-forming cells."
https://openalex.org/W2280357780,"The yeast cell wall integrity MAPK Slt2 mediates the transcriptional response to cell wall alterations through phosphorylation of transcription factors Rlm1 and SBF. However, the variety of cellular functions regulated by Slt2 suggests the existence of a significant number of still unknown substrates for this kinase. To identify novel Slt2 targets, we generated and characterized an analog-sensitive mutant of Slt2 (Slt2-as) that can be specifically inhibited by bulky kinase inhibitor analogs. We demonstrated that Slt2-as is able to use adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate analogs to thiophosphorylate its substrates in yeast cell extracts as well as when produced as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. Taking advantage of this chemical-genetic approach, we found that Slt2 phosphorylates the MAPK phosphatase Msg5 both in the N-terminal regulatory and C-terminal catalytic domains. Moreover, we identified the calcineurin regulator Rcn2, the 4E-BP (translation initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein) translation repressor protein Caf20, and the Golgi-associated adaptor Gga1 as novel targets for Slt2. The Slt2 phosphorylation sites on Rcn2 and Caf20 were determined. We also demonstrated that, in the absence of SLT2, the GGA1 paralog GGA2 is essential for cells to survive under cell wall stress and for proper protein sorting through the carboxypeptidase Y pathway. Therefore, Slt2-as provides a powerful tool that can expand our knowledge of the outputs of the cell wall integrity MAPK pathway.

Protein phosphorylation is a key regulatory event in signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. As a result, protein kinases, a family of enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of substrate proteins, play a major role in signaling pathways. Among them, MAPK pathways contain a three-tiered protein kinase cascade that consists of a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 3The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; CWI, cell wall integrity; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; as, analog-sensitive; CR, Congo red; 2,3-DMB-PP1, 4-Amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(2,3-dimethylbenzyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; BCIP, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; 4E-BP, translation initiation factor eIF4E-binding protein; GGA, Golgi-associated, γ-adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding protein; RCAN, regulator of the Ca2+ and calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine phosphatase calcineurin; AP, alkaline phosphatase. kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase (MAPK) that are sequentially phosphorylated at their activation loop upon stimulation (1Qi M. Elion E.A. MAP kinase pathways.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3569-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Once activated, the MAPK in turn phosphorylates specific protein targets on serine and threonine residues within a consensus T/SP motif (2Ubersax J.A. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Mechanisms of specificity in protein phosphorylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 530-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). These MAPK substrates are effectors of the cellular response triggered by the extracellular signal. The model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has five MAPK pathways that are involved in the regulation of mating, filamentous and invasive growth, osmoregulation, cell wall integrity (CWI), and spore wall assembly (3Chen R.E.

When the integrity of the cell wall is threatened, a compensatory salvage mechanism is activated to strengthen this vital structure. This cellular response is mainly mediated by the CWI pathway, which is essential for survival under cell wall stress conditions. The MAPK of this pathway, Slt2, directly phosphorylates the transcription factor Rlm1 (5Jung U.S. Sobering A.K. Romeo M.J. Levin D.E. Regulation of the yeast Rlm1 transcription factor by the Mpk1 cell wall integrity MAP kinase.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), which is responsible for the major transcriptional response (6García R. Bermejo C. Grau C. Pérez R. Rodríguez-Peña J.M.

Cell. 2014; 25: 1396-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have also been reported to be phosphorylated by Slt2. Phosphorylation-based feedback loops that are exerted by Slt2 on upstream components of the CWI pathway, such as the Rho1-GDP-GTP exchange factor Rom2 and the MAPKKs Mkk1 and Mkk2 as well as on its negative regulator, the protein phosphatase Msg5, have also been described (11Molina M. Cid V.J. Martín H. Fine regulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAPK pathways by post-translational modifications.Yeast. 2010; 27: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, although Slt2 regulates other cellular functions not mediated by its known targets, such as pexophagy, mitophagy, or the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (12Mao K. Klionsky D.J. MAPKs regulate mitophagy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 1564-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Bonilla M. Cunningham K.W. Mitogen-activated protein kinase stimulation of Ca2+ signaling is required for survival of endoplasmic reticulum stress in yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4296-4305Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), no other bona fide Slt2 direct substrates have been identified to date. Over the past few years, several novel methods for kinase substrate identification have been developed. On the one hand, large scale MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomic approaches allow the detection of proteins that become specifically phosphorylated upon activation of a signal transduction pathway (14Thingholm T.E. Jensen O.N. Larsen M.R. Analytical strategies for phosphoproteomics.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1451-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This is a very powerful technique that also brings about the identification of the phosphorylation sites within the protein, although the information regarding the kinase responsible for the phosphate transfer is uncoupled from the phosphorylation event. On the other hand, one technique that provides a direct coupling of kinase activity to its substrate relies on the use of analog-sensitive (as) kinases and orthogonal unnatural ATP analogs for the selective labeling of direct substrates by in vitro kinase assays (15Bishop A. Buzko O. Heyeck-Dumas S. Jung I. Kraybill B. Liu Y. Shah K. Ulrich S. Witucki L. Yang F. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Unnatural ligands for engineered proteins: new tools for chemical genetics.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this approach the active site of the kinase is engineered to allow the enzyme to accept a bulky ATP analog in which the γ-phosphate is replaced with a thiophosphate moiety. Such an ATP analog is not recognized by other wild-type kinases, and therefore, only the modified kinase is able to transfer the thiophosphate group to its target proteins. Then, thiophosphorylated proteins can be specifically immunodetected or affinity-purified (16Hertz N.T. Wang B.T. Allen J.J. Zhang C. Dar A.C. Burlingame A.L. Shokat K.M. Chemical genetic approach for kinase-substrate mapping by covalent capture of thiophosphopeptides and analysis by mass spectrometry.Curr. Protoc. Chem. Biol. 2010; 2: 15-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This strategy can be used to confirm direct phosphorylation of candidate substrates by a particular kinase or to identify direct substrates in complex samples, like cell extracts. In addition, as-kinases are valuable tools for functional studies because they allow their specific inhibition with bulky inhibitor analogs (17Zhang C. Lopez M.S. Dar A.C. Ladow E. Finkbeiner S. Yun C.H. Eck M.J. Shokat K.M. Structure-guided inhibitor design expands the scope of analog-sensitive kinase technology.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By using a quantitative stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based phosphoproteomic approach, we previously identified a number of putative Slt2 targets that displayed enhanced phosphorylation at (S/T)P sites upon CWI pathway stimulation triggered by Pkc1 hyperactivation (18Mascaraque V. Hernáez M.L. Jiménez-Sánchez M. Hansen R. Gil C. Martín H. Cid V.J. Molina M.

Here, by using an analog-sensitive version of this MAPK (Slt2-as) and an ATPγS analog in in vitro kinase assays, we confirm that three of these candidates, Rcn2, Gga1, and Caf20, are bona fide substrates of Slt2.

First, SLT2 or slt2-as was amplified by PCR with primers FwNco1-BamH1-SLT2 and RvBamH1STOPNco1-SLT2 using plasmids pRS316-SLT2 or pRS316-slt2-as as templates, respectively. These were then cloned into pGEMT (Promega) to generate the pGEMT-SLT2 and pGEMT-slt2-as plasmids. Second, the NcoI-BamHI fragments from these plasmids were subcloned into pEG(KG) (28Mitchell D.A.

The minimal inhibitory concentration of Congo red in the presence of 2,3-DMB-PP1 was estimated using the microdilution method in microplates of 96 wells with YPD medium, incubated at 30 °C for 48 h.

The molecular processes governing availability of NET in the plasma membrane are poorly understood. Here we use the fluorescent cocaine analogue JHC 1-64, as well as several other approaches, to investigate the trafficking itinerary of NET in live noradrenergic neurons. Confocal imaging revealed extensive constitutive internalization of JHC 1-64-labeled NET in the neuronal somata, proximal extensions and presynaptic boutons. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate increased intracellular accumulation of JHC 1-64-labeled NET and caused a parallel reduction in uptake capacity. Internalized NET strongly colocalized with the “long loop” recycling marker Rab11, whereas less overlap was seen with the “short loop” recycling marker Rab4 and the late endosomal marker Rab7. Moreover, mitigating Rab11 function by overexpression of dominant negative Rab11 impaired NET function. Sorting of NET to the Rab11 recycling compartment was further supported by confocal imaging and reversible biotinylation experiments in transfected differentiated CATH.a cells. In contrast to NET, the dopamine transporter displayed markedly less constitutive internalization and limited sorting to the Rab11 recycling compartment in the differentiated CATH.a cells. Exchange of domains between the two homologous transporters revealed that this difference was determined by non-conserved structural elements in the intracellular N terminus.

The reuptake is mediated by the NE transporter (NET), which is present in noradrenergic neurons both in the brain and in the peripheral sympathetic nerve system (1Iversen L.L.

It is assumed that the amount of NET present in the presynaptic plasma membrane is tightly controlled to sustain NE homeostasis, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Several mechanisms have been suggested to regulate NET distribution, including protein kinase C (PKC), whose activation (e.g. by Gq-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) can increase NET internalization and reduce NE transport capacity (11Apparsundaram S.

The general NET trafficking properties and postendocytic sorting pattern, however, have not been investigated in detail. Of interest, several SLC6 family transporters, such as the dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT), and glycine transporters, have been shown to undergo constitutive internalization (18Loder M.K.

Here, we employ several different approaches, including use of the fluorescent cocaine analogue JHC 1-64, to describe NET surface distribution, internalization, and postendocytic sorting in live noradrenergic neurons. We show that NET undergoes extensive constitutive internalization and that internalized NET mainly is sorted to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Inhibition of Rab11 function by dominant negative Rab11 (Rab11 S25N) impairs NE uptake capacity in noradrenergic neurons, implying that correct and sufficient postendocytic recycling is critical for NET function. Finally, we find that NET displays a markedly higher degree of constitutive internalization than DAT and that this difference, together with the differential postendocytic sorting of NET compared with DAT, is determined in part by non-conserved structural elements in the intracellular N termini of the two transport proteins. Our results reveal striking differences in the trafficking itineraries of NET compared with DAT and provide thereby a critical framework for further deciphering the role of NET and DAT in controlling neurotransmitter homeostasis and how this might be altered in diseased states.

A DAT/NET(590–617) chimeric construct was generated by introducing a unique restriction site, BsiI, to the coding sequence of NET by PCR. Subsequently, the C-terminal tail of NET was ligated into DAT using digestion with BsiI and XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3.1. DAT(1–59)/NET and NET/DAT(593–620) chimeras were generated by a two-step PCR procedure. First, the N terminus (residues 1–59) and C terminus (residues 593–620) of DAT were amplified from pcDNA3 DAT with primers that generated overhangs identical to the corresponding sequences of NET. Second, the NET parts of the chimeras (NET(56–617) and NET(1–590)) were amplified from NET pcDNA3 with primers that generated overhangs identical to the N and C termini of DAT. Products from the first PCR rounds were used as templates for generating the respective chimeras that were subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1. TacNET was likewise generated by a two-step PCR procedure. First, the FLAG-Tac was amplified from pcDNA3 FLAG-Tac with primers generating an overhang identical to the N-terminal part of NET. Second, NET was amplified from pcDNA3 NET with primers with an overhang identical to the C-terminal part of FLAG-Tac. The products from the first round of PCR were used as templates for generating a TacNET fragment that subsequently was cloned into pcDNA3.

Briefly, ganglia from 0–3-day-old rat pups were dissected and dissociated for 30 min at 37 °C in 3 mg/ml collagenase/0.5 mg/ml trypsin in RPMI medium gently oxygenated with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Digestion was terminated by adding 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in RPMI medium. Subsequently, cells were briefly centrifuged and then resuspended in warm RPMI medium supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated FBS and 20 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF). Digested tissue was carefully triturated into single cells by using increasingly smaller pipette tips. The neurons were seeded onto coverslips coated with glial cells for immunocytochemistry into similarly coated Lab-Tek chambers for live cell imaging or into similarly coated 96-well plates for uptake experiments. On the next day, cultures were treated with 1 μm 5-fluoro-5-deoxyuridine to inhibit glial cell growth. Cultures were grown for 12–16 days in supplemented RPMI medium prior to experiments. Lentivirus was produced as described previously (20Eriksen J. Rasmussen S.G. Rasmussen T.N. Vaegter C.B. Cha J.H. Zou M.F. Newman A.H. Gether U.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with HEPES and sodium bicarbonate (DMEM 1965), and differentiated CATH.a (CAD) cells (ATCC CRL-11179), originating from mouse brain, were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM 1965 and Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen), both supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.01 mg/ml gentamicin. For transient expression, the cells were transfected using standard Lipofectamine 2000 protocols (Invitrogen) 2 days prior to experiments. NET uptake experiments were carried out using [3H]DA (30–60 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as substrate. NET transports DA and NE with similar affinity (Km = 0.5–1 μm), and [3H]DA is commonly used as NET substrate (26Giros B. Wang Y.M. Suter S. McLeskey S.B. Pifl C. Caron M.G.

Medium was removed from SCG neurons cultured on glial cell monolayers in 96-well plates, and the cells were equilibrated in uptake buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm l-ascorbic acid, 5 mm d-glucose, and 1 μm catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor Ro 41-0960 (Sigma)) for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μm) or vehicle (0.01% DMSO) was added, and neurons were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Uptake was initiated by the addition of 100 nm [3H]DA, allowed to continue for 5 min at room temperature, and terminated by rapid aspiration of the medium and two washes with ice-cold uptake buffer. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 100 μm desipramine. Opti-Phase HiSafe3 scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the wells, and the samples were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β-scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Saturation kinetics of DA uptake were determined using increasing concentrations of DA (final concentration 0.05–6.4 μm) with a trace amount of [3H]DA in CAD cells transfected 48 h before the experiment with equal amounts of constructs encoding NET, DAT, NET-DAT chimeras, or TacNET. Uptake was initiated by adding serial dilutions of dopamine/[3H]dopamine and was allowed to continue for 3 min at room temperature. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 100 μm nomifensine. Subsequently, cells were lysed in 1% SDS and transferred to counting plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), Opti-Phase HiSafe3 scintillation fluid was added, and the samples were counted in a Wallac Tri-Lux β-scintillation counter. Uptake data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). SCG neurons grown on glial monolayers on coverslips were incubated with 50 nm JHC 1-64 in imaging buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5 mm d-glucose) for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the specimens were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), blocked and permeabilized in blocking/permeabilization buffer (5% goat serum, 0.2% saponin, PBS), and immunostained with a monoclonal mouse anti-NET antibody (NET-05, mAb Technologies; 1:1000) or a monoclonal mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (Mab318; Millipore, 1:1000) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were labeled with a goat polyclonal anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. The specimens were mounted on glass slides with Slow-Fade Antifade (Invitrogen) and visualized by confocal microscopy. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510) with an oil immersion ×63 lens with a 1.4 numerical aperture (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) as described (20Eriksen J.

Alexa Fluor 488 dye and EGFP were excited using a 488-nm laser line from an argon-krypton laser, and the emitted light was filtered using a long pass 505–530-nm barrier filter. Image processing was performed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). NET surface expression was visualized in live SCG neurons grown on glial monolayers in LabTek chambers using the rhodamine-conjugated cocaine analogue JHC 1-64 (50 nm) in imaging buffer for 20 min at 4 °C to label surface NET. Subsequently, the buffer was removed, and the cells were rapidly washed twice with cold imaging buffer and imaged immediately using a Zeiss LSM 510 instrument. To verify the specific binding of JHC 1-64 to NET, some specimens were preincubated with desipramine (100 μm) for 20 min before labeling with JHC 1-64. To visualize NET internalization in live neurons, SCG neurons were first incubated with JHC 1-64 (50 nm) at 4 °C to label surface NET. Subsequently, the buffer was removed and replaced with prewarmed imaging buffer, and internalization was allowed for 1 h at 37 °C. JHC 1-64-labeled NET was then visualized by confocal microscopy carried out at 37 °C. To assess the effect of activation of PKC on NET internalization, SCG neurons were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or vehicle (0.01% DMSO) after surface labeling of NET with JHC 1-64 at 4 °C. To investigate the postendocytic fate of internalized NET in live neurons, SCG neurons were transduced with different endosomal markers (EGFP-Rab4, -Rab7, -Rab11, and -Rab11 S25N) on days 4–5 in vitro. Next, transduced (and non-transduced) SCG neurons were incubated with JHC 1-64 (50 nm) to label surface NET before 1 h of internalization at 37 °C. After incubation, the living neurons were imaged by confocal microscopy carried out at 37 °C. To further assess the postendocytic fate of NET, we also visualized lysosomes by incubating non-transduced SCG neurons with LysoTracker Green (50 nm; Invitrogen) during the last 15 min of incubation at 37 °C. Finally, cells were washed twice and imaged at 37 °C. CAD cells transiently transfected with equal amounts of TacNET and EGFP-Rab7 or EGFP-Rab11 were seeded on coverslips treated with poly-l-ornithine. The cells were incubated with a mouse anti-FLAG antibody (M1 antibody) (1 μg/ml) in DMEM at 4 °C for 30 min to label surface-expressed TacNET. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with DMEM and then incubated in prewarmed medium for 1 h at 37 °C allowing internalization (or at 4 °C as a non-trafficking surface control). Internalization was terminated by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min, permeabilization in blocking/permeabilization buffer, and incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody for 30 min. Finally, the specimens were washed, mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), and visualized by confocal microscopy. To evaluate colocalization of the transporters with different endosomal markers, CAD cells were transiently transfected with equal amounts of the transporters of interest (NET, DAT, or NET-DAT chimeras) and either EGFP-Rab7 or EGFP-Rab11. JHC 1-64 internalization assays were performed 48 h post-transfection by labeling surface expressed transporters at 4 °C with JHC 1-64 (50 nm). Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow internalization and imaged at 37 °C. Evaluation of transporter colocalization with EGFP-Rab7 and EGFP-Rab11 was performe"
https://openalex.org/W2258189350,"Confounding factors In transcriptomics experimentation, confounding factors frequently exist alongside the intended experimental factors and can severely influence the outcome of a transcriptome analysis. Confounding factors are regularly discussed in methodological literature, but their actual, practical impact on the outcome and interpretation of transcriptomics experiments is, to our knowledge, not documented. For instance, in-vivo experimental factors; like Individual, Sample-Composition and Time-of-Day are potentially formidable confounding factors. To study these confounding factors, we designed an extensive in-vivo transcriptome experiment (n = 264) with UVR exposure of murine skin containing six consecutive samples from each individual mouse (n = 64). Analysis Approach Evaluation of the confounding factors: Sample-Composition, Time-of-Day, Handling-Stress, and Individual-Mouse resulted in the identification of many genes that were affected by them. These genes sometimes showed over 30-fold expression differences. The most prominent confounding factor was Sample-Composition caused by mouse-dependent skin composition differences, sampling variation and/or influx/efflux of mobile cells. Although we can only evaluate these effects for known cell type specifically expressed genes in our complex heterogeneous samples, it is clear that the observed variations also affect the cumulative expression levels of many other non-cell-type-specific genes. ANOVA ANOVA analysis can only attempt to neutralize the effects of the well-defined confounding factors, such as Individual-Mouse, on the experimental factors UV-Dose and Recovery-Time. Also, by definition, ANOVA only yields reproducible gene-expression differences, but we found that these differences were very small compared to the fold changes induced by the confounding factors, questioning the biological relevance of these ANOVA-detected differences. Furthermore, it turned out that many of the differentially expressed genes found by ANOVA were also present in the gene clusters associated with the confounding factors. Conclusion Hence our overall conclusion is that confounding factors have a major impact on the outcome of in-vivo transcriptomics experiments. Thus the set-up, analysis, and interpretation of such experiments should be approached with the utmost prudence."
https://openalex.org/W2287634796,"Arrestins were originally described as proteins recruited to ligand-activated, phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to attenuate G protein-mediated signaling. It was later revealed that arrestins also mediate GPCR internalization and recruit a number of signaling proteins including, but not limited to, Src family kinases, ERK1/2, and JNK3. GPCR-arrestin binding and trafficking control the spatial and temporal activity of these multi-protein complexes. In previous reports, we concluded that N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-mediated apoptosis, which occurs upon receptor stimulation in the absence of arrestins, is associated with FPR accumulation in perinuclear recycling endosomes. Under these conditions, inhibition of Src kinase and ERK1/2 prevented FPR-mediated apoptosis. To better understand the role of Src kinase in this process, in the current study we employed a previously described arrestin-2 (arr2) mutant deficient in Src kinase binding (arr2-P91G/P121E). Unlike wild type arrestin, arr2-P91G/P121E did not inhibit FPR-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that Src binding to arrestin-2 prevents apoptotic signaling. However, in cells expressing this mutant, FPR-mediated apoptosis was still blocked by inhibition of Src kinase activity, suggesting that activation of Src independent of arrestin-2 binding is involved in FPR-mediated apoptosis. Finally, while Src kinase inhibition prevented FPR-mediated-apoptosis in the presence of arr2-P91G/P121E, it did not prevent FPR-arr2-P91G/P121E accumulation in the perinuclear recycling endosome. On the contrary, inhibition of Src kinase activity mediated the accumulation of activated FPR-wild type arrestin-2 in recycling endosomes without initiating FPR-mediated apoptosis. Based on these observations, we conclude that Src kinase has two independent roles following FPR activation that regulate both FPR-arrestin-2 signaling and trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2408918950,"Over the last half-century, coral diseases have contributed to the rapid decline of coral populations throughout the Caribbean region. Some coral diseases appear to be potentially infectious, yet little is known about their modes of transmission. This study experimentally tested whether dark-spot syndrome on Siderastrea siderea was directly or indirectly transmissible to neighboring coral colonies. We also tested whether open wounds were necessary to facilitate disease transmission. At the completion of the experiments, we sampled bacterial communities on diseased, exposed, and healthy coral colonies to determine whether bacterial pathogens had transmitted to the susceptible colonies. We saw no evidence of either direct or waterborne transmission of dark-spot syndrome, and corals that received lesions by direct contact with diseased tissue, healed and showed no signs of infection. There were no significant differences among bacterial communities on healthy, exposed, and diseased colonies, although nine individual ribotypes were significantly higher in diseased corals compared with healthy and exposed corals, indicating a lack of transmission. Although our experiments do not fully refute the possibility that dark-spot syndrome is infectious and transmissible, our results suggest that in situ macroscopic signs of dark-spot syndrome are not always contagious."
https://openalex.org/W2278459484,"The Asian Tree Toad genus Pedostibes, as currently understood, exhibits a conspicuously disjunct distribution, posing several immediate questions relating to the biogeography and taxonomy of this poorly known group. The type species, P. tuberculosus and P. kempi, are known only from India, whereas P. hosii, P. rugosus, and P. everetti are restricted to Southeast Asia. Several studies have shown that these allopatric groups are polyphyletic, with the Indian Pedostibes embedded within a primarily South Asian clade of toads, containing the genera Adenomus, Xanthophryne, and Duttaphrynus. Southeast Asian Pedostibes on the other hand, are nested within a Southeast Asian clade, which is the sister lineage to the Southeast Asian river toad genus Phrynoidis. We demonstrate that Indian and Southeast Asian Pedostibes are not only allopatric and polyphyletic, but also exhibit significant differences in morphology and reproductive mode, indicating that the Southeast Asian species’ are not congeneric with the true Pedostibes of India. As a taxonomic solution, we describe a new genus, Rentapia gen. nov. to accommodate the Southeast Asian species."
https://openalex.org/W2256931946,"Here, we studied the underlying mechanism of aldosterone (Aldo)-induced vascular endothelial cell damages by focusing on ceramide. We confirmed that Aldo (at nmol/L) inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) survival, and induced considerable cell apoptosis. We propose that ceramide (mainly C18) production might be responsible for Aldo-mediated damages in HUVECs. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an anti-ceramide lipid, attenuated Aldo-induced ceramide production and following HUVEC damages. On the other hand, the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor PDMP or the ceramide (C6) potentiated Aldo-induced HUVEC apoptosis. Eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, almost completely blocked Aldo-induced C18 ceramide production and HUVEC damages. Molecularly, ceramide synthase 1 (CerS-1) is required for C18 ceramide production by Aldo. Knockdown of CerS-1 by targeted-shRNA inhibited Aldo-induced C18 ceramide production, and protected HUVECs from Aldo. Reversely, CerS-1 overexpression facilitated Aldo-induced C18 ceramide production, and potentiated HUVEC damages. Together, these results suggest that C18 ceramide production mediates Aldo-mediated HUVEC damages. MR and CerS-1 could be the two signaling molecule regulating C18 ceramide production by Aldo."
https://openalex.org/W2285405837,"ABCB4/MDR3, a member of the ABC superfamily, is an ATP-dependent phosphatidylcholine translocator expressed at the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. Defects in the ABCB4 gene are associated with rare biliary diseases. It is essential to understand the mechanisms of its canalicular membrane expression in particular for the development of new therapies. The stability of several ABC transporters is regulated through their binding to PDZ (PSD95/DglA/ZO-1) domain-containing proteins. ABCB4 protein ends by the sequence glutamine-asparagine-leucine (QNL), which shows some similarity to PDZ-binding motifs. The aim of our study was to assess the potential role of the QNL motif on the surface expression of ABCB4 and to determine if PDZ domain-containing proteins are involved. We found that truncation of the QNL motif decreased the stability of ABCB4 in HepG2-transfected cells. The deleted mutant ABCB4-ΔQNL also displayed accelerated endocytosis. EBP50, a PDZ protein highly expressed in the liver, strongly colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with ABCB4, and this interaction required the QNL motif. Down-regulation of EBP50 by siRNA or by expression of an EBP50 dominant-negative mutant caused a significant decrease in the level of ABCB4 protein expression, and in the amount of ABCB4 localized at the canalicular membrane. Interaction of ABCB4 with EBP50 through its PDZ-like motif plays a critical role in the regulation of ABCB4 expression and stability at the canalicular plasma membrane."

In the same year as LifA was described in EPEC, a near identical factor was described in EHEC O111:H− that was associated with bacterial adherence to cultured epithelial cells. The authors named the factor EHEC factor for adherence 1 (Efa1), however, it has 97.4% amino acid identity to lymphostatin, and they are likely equivalent proteins (8Nicholls L. Grant T.H.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although a direct role of Efa1 in adherence has been reported using rabbit EPEC (9Badea L. Doughty S. Nicholls L. Sloan J.

Frankel G. Phillips A.D. Wallis T.S. Efa1 influences colonization of the bovine intestine by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli serotypes O5 and O111.Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 5158-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently also been reported that lymphostatin can be secreted via the type III secretion system, but its functions once injected into host cells are unknown (10Deng W. Yu H.B. de Hoog C.L. Stoynov N. Li Y. Foster L.J. Finlay B.B.

Understanding of the mode of action of lymphostatin has been constrained by the instability of plasmid clones and difficulties in obtaining full-length purified protein (2Klapproth J.M. Scaletsky I.C. McNamara B.P. Lai L.C. Malstrom C. James S.P. Donnenberg M.S. A large toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli strains that inhibits lymphocyte activation.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, even plasmid-driven soluble expression of smaller fragments of lymphostatin has proven to be difficult (11Abu-Median A.-B. van Diemen P.M. Dziva F. Vlisidou I. Wallis T.S. Stevens M.P. Functional analysis of lymphostatin homologues in enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 258: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis has identified homology between the amino-terminal of LifA/Efa1 and the catalytic glycosyltransferase domain of the LCTs (2Klapproth J.M. Scaletsky I.C. McNamara B.P. Lai L.C.

These clostridial cytotoxic molecules are large proteins whose catalytic domain glycosylates Rho-family GTPases that regulate the actin network (12Jank T. Belyi Y. Aktories K. Bacterial glycosyltransferase toxins.Cell Microbiol. 2015; 17: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). They are retaining enzymes with a GT-A fold, which belong to glycosyltransferase family 44 and are characterized by having a DXD (Asp-Xaa-Asp) motif involved in metal ion binding together with the diphosphate moiety of the UDP-sugar donor (13Lairson L.L. Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Withers S.G. Glycosyltransferases: structures, functions, and mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). It is a multistep reaction dependent on the DXD motif, where sugar binding and hydrolysis is followed by transfer of the released sugar to an acceptor protein (reviewed in Ref. 12Jank T. Belyi Y. Aktories K. Bacterial glycosyltransferase toxins.Cell Microbiol. 2015; 17: 1752-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies show that attaching and effacing E. coli express another novel protein, NleB, which is an effector glycosyltransferase injected into host cells upon infection. NleB blocks death receptor-induced apoptosis and promotes intestinal colonization (14Li S. Zhang L. Yao Q. Li L. Dong N. Rong J. Gao W. Ding X. Sun L. Chen X. Chen S. Shao F.

NleB uses uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as its donor sugar and covalently N-links a GlcNAc to a conserved arginine residue in death domain containing adaptor proteins (14Li S.

This modification had not previously been described and most GlcNAc addition to proteins occurs via O-linkage on serine/threonine residues (14Li S. Zhang L. Yao Q. Li L. Dong N. Rong J. Gao W.

Apart from the glycosyltransferase domain, searches also identified a Yersinia YopT-like cysteine protease (CP) motif in the sequence of lymphostatin (17Shao F. Merritt P.M. Bao Z. Innes R.W.

These features represent a small portion of the primary sequence of lymphostatin, and are restricted to the N-terminal third of the protein. Although one report claimed that deletion of the predicted glycosyltransferase and cysteine protease motifs attenuated C. rodentium in mice (5Klapproth J.-M. Sasaki M. Sherman M. Babbin B. Donnenberg M.S. Fernandes P.J. Scaletsky I.C. Kalman D. Nusrat A. Williams I.R. Citrobacter rodentium lifA/efa1 is essential for colonic colonization and crypt cell hyperplasia in vivo.Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), close inspection reveals that stop codons were introduced that resulted in protein truncation at the deletion site rather than in-frame mutations, making the results difficult to interpret (4Deacon V. Dziva F. van Diemen P.M. Frankel G. Stevens M.P. Efa-1/LifA mediates intestinal colonization of calves by enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli O26:H: in a manner independent of glycosyltransferase and cysteine protease motifs or effects on type III secretion.Microbiology. 2010; 156: 2527-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Given its large size and the paucity in understanding how lymphostatin is able to carry out its activities, we sought to produce a full-length recombinant lymphostatin and characterize its structural and biophysical features, as well as its effects on activated T cells. Here we show that full-length lymphostatin can be expressed as a folded, biologically active recombinant protein that inhibits bovine T cell proliferation at very low concentrations. Furthermore, like other glycosyltransferases, it has sugar-binding potential, and both its biological activity and sugar binding is dependent on a DXD motif, which has been implicated in the activity of glycosyltransferases. Although the activity of lymphostatin was identified more than a decade ago, this is the first significant step forward in understanding the mechanisms underlying its intrinsic activities. The full-length gene encoding lymphostatin (∼9.6 kb) was cloned using the commercially available Expresso Rhamnose cloning and expression system (Lucigen Inc.) from the prototype enteropathogenic E. coli serotype O127:H6 strain E2348/69. The lymphostatin gene was amplified using genomic DNA from E2348/69 as lymphostatin activity was first described in this strain (2Klapproth J.M. Scaletsky I.C. McNamara B.P. Lai L.C. Malstrom C. James S.P. Donnenberg M.S. A large toxin from pathogenic Escherichia coli strains that inhibits lymphocyte activation.Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2148-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The pRham vector incorporates a C-terminal in-frame His6 tag. Amplicons were generated using the primers EXPLifA_FOR, 5′-GAAGGAGATATACATATGAGACTGCCAGAGAAAGTTCTT-3′ and EXPLifA_REV, 5′-GTGATGGTGGTGATGATGGTTAAAAAGGTTGTCACCATT-3′ with PHUSION proofreading polymerase (Thermo Scientific). Amplicons of the appropriate size were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using Geneclean II (MP Biomedicals, Inc.). The amplicons were cloned into pre-linearized pRham vector by homologous recombination in E. cloni 10G® (Lucigen Inc.) chemically competent cells. Subsequent transformants were screened by colony PCR using primers supplied by the manufacturer: pRham Forward, 5′-GCTTTTTAGACTGGTCGTAGGGAG-3′ and pETite Reverse, 5′-CTCAAGACCCGTTTAGAGGC-3′. The sequence of two independent clones (pRHAM-LifA-6xH) were confirmed to be identical to the published lifA sequence of E2348/69 (gene E2348C_3234; (18Iguchi A. Thomson N.R. Ogura Y. Saunders D.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar)) by full-length Sanger sequencing on both strands using primers every 500 bp (GATC-Biotech). To remove the DXD motif the amino acids DTD at position 557–559 were substituted with AAA using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, using the pRHAM-LifA-6xH plasmid as a template, the primers LifA-DXD-1 (Forward), GGATGTATATCCTTAAAGAGCATGGTGGTATTTATACAGCGGCCGCGATGATGCCTGCATACTCTAAACAAGTAATTTTTAAAA, and LifA-DXD-2 (Reverse), TTTTAAAAATTACTTGTTTAGAGTATGCAGGCATCATCGCGGCCGCTGTATAAATACCACCATGCTCTTTAAGGATATACATCC, were used to introduce AAA to the sequence, by total replication of the plasmid, followed by digestion of the parent plasmid. A NotI restriction endonuclease site (indicated in bold) was also introduced at the site of mutation. Putative mutant plasmids were screened by restriction digest with NotI, and verified by Sanger sequencing on both strands (GATC-Biotech). Recombinant His-tagged lymphostatin (rLifA) was overexpressed in E. cloni® cells cultured in lysogeny broth at 37 °C, 250 rpm shaking to A600 nm 0.8. Expression of the protein was induced by the addition of l-rhamnose to 0.2% (w/v) and cultured for a further 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, re-suspended in 20 mm sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), pH 7.6, 300 mm sodium chloride, 500 mm non-detergent sulfobetaine (NDSB201), 20 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 complete protease inhibitor tablet/3 g cell mass (Roche), 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and lysed by high pressure lysis by single passage, at 30 kpsi, through a Constant Systems TS 1.1 kW Benchtop Cell disruptor. All chromatography was performed on an ÄKTA Explorer 10 UV900 LC system (GE Healthcare) at 6 °C. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (50,000 × g at 4 °C) and loaded onto a Ni2+ ion-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column (HisTrap FF; GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 300 mm sodium chloride, 20 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 at 2 ml/min. This was followed by washing with 15 column volumes (cv) of the same buffer (Buffer A) and 15 cv of Buffer A supplemented with 4% Buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 300 mm sodium chloride, 500 mm imidazole, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). rLifA was eluted by increasing the concentration of imidazole up to 500 mm over 5 cv (gradient over 5 cv); all at 2 ml/min. rLifA was passed over a size exclusion column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 300 mm sodium chloride, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 to separate low molecular weight contaminants (Superose-6pg XK16/60; GE Healthcare) at 1 ml/min. Fractions containing rLifA were buffer exchanged into 15 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 50 mm sodium chloride, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 at 8 ml/min and further purified to homogeneity by anion exchange (HiPrep desalt 26/10; Mono-Q 5/50 GL; GE Healthcare) at 1 ml/min. The protein was eluted by running a gradient from 15 to 500 mm NaCl over 30 cv; the protein eluted at a salt concentration of 160 mm. AAA mutant full-length lymphostatin (rLifADTD/AAA) was purified using the same strategy as rLifA protein, and the chromatograms were indistinguishable. The induction, size, and stability of expressed proteins were assessed by 3–8% Tris acetate SDS-PAGE and/or by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody specific for His6 (4A12E4, Novex, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Access to bovine blood for these studies was approved by the local ethics committee and blood draws were carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. PBMCs were isolated from 12–18-month-old Holstein-Friesian cows. Briefly, blood was collected into heparinized bags or syringes. Following centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 15 min to generate an initial buffy coat, the white blood cell fractions were pooled, layered over Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare), and centrifuged for 30 min at 1,200 × g with the brake off. The PBMCs were collected from the interface and washed several times before use. If required, the T lymphocyte fraction was further enriched using a sterile wool column (Polysciences, Inc.), as suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, columns were washed in sterile Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin, 20 mm l-glutamine (Life Technologies), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were applied at 108/ml, run into the column by gravity, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C per 5% CO2. Unbound cells (mainly composed of T cells) were washed off the column in 10 ml of medium, spun down, and counted. The purity of T cell preparations was checked by single channel flow cytometry. Cells were stained with a commercially available anti-bovine CD3 antibody (MM1A; IgG1; VMRD, Pullman, WA). Secondary staining with a FITC-conjugated anti-IgG1 secondary antibody was carried out, and the samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) and FloJo software (Tree Star). A minimum of 10,000 events were collected, with an initial gate for live cells based on forward/side scatter parameters. Enriched T cells were used to test the activity of rLifA, purified partial fragments, and rLifADTD/AAA using a standard colorimetric measurement of mitogenic activation of proliferation. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottom plates (Costar) in triplicate for all conditions. rLifA, rLifADTD/AAA, or a fragment thereof was added at a final concentration as indicated in the figure legends. Cell proliferation was stimulated using the mitogen concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in the presence or absence of recombinant lymphostatin as indicated in a final volume of 100 μl/well. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. The colorimetric substrate CellTiter 96® AQueous One (Promega) was added 18 h before the end of the assay. All measurements were carried out at 492 nm on a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Scientific). Cells and medium alone were used as negative controls. Background medium measurements were subtracted from all values. All treatments are expressed as a Proliferation Index, which is calculated by the ratio of: [absorbance (cells treated with ConA and recombinant protein)/absorbance (cells treated with ConA alone)]. Isolated T cells were tested for cytotoxic effect of rLifA using a lactate dehydrogenase release assay (Cytotoxicity Detection Test Plus, Roche) according to the manufacturer's directions, using an 8-h incubation period. The identity of full-length recombinant lymphostatin was confirmed by in-gel protein digest and peptide analysis. Excised gel-bands were incubated at a porcine trypsin:lymphostatin ratio of ∼1:30, in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 32 °C (Promega). Peptides were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectroscopy on a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix. The spectral data were processed using Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems) and the MASCOT NCBInr database searched against the peptide mass map (Matrix Science). To investigate the domain structure of lymphostatin, purified protein was incubated with trypsin at a ratio of 375:1, at 21 °C, to give limited digestion. Aliquots were removed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h and the reaction stopped by boiling samples adjusted with 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm PMSF in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Digest products were separated by SDS-PAGE and individual bands were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy as described above. Peptide masses were compared with the sequence of full-length rLifA using GPMAW 9.2 software, mass tolerance 50 ppm (19Peri S. Steen H. Pandey A. GPMAW–a software tool for analyzing proteins and peptides.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 687-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Fragment F1 was purified to homogeneity from other digest products by ion-exchange chromatography (Mono-Q 5/50 GL; GE Healthcare) as described above. Size exclusion chromatography coupled to UV, static light scattering, and refractive index detection were used to determine the molecular mass of pure rLifA in solution and to estimate the detergent load (Viscotec SEC-MALS 20 and Viscotek RI Detector:VE3580; Malvern Instruments). One hundred μl of 1 mg/ml of lymphostatin was passed over a size exclusion column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20 (Superose6 10/300 G"

Much attention from the network science community are paid to figure out how to efficiently predict the missing/future links based on the observed topology. Real-world information always contain noise, which is also the case in an observed network. This problem is rarely considered in existing methods. In this paper, we treat the existence of observed links as known information. By filtering out noises in this information, the underlying regularity of the connection information is retrieved and then used to predict missing or future links. Experiments on various empirical networks show that our method performs noticeably better than baseline algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2465523672,"Bream pond aquaculture plays a very important role in China's aquaculture industry and is the main source of aquatic products. To regulate and control pond water quality and sediment, a movable solar pond aquaculture water quality regulation machine (SMWM) was designed and used. This machine is solar-powered and moves on water, and its primary components are a solar power supply device, a sediment lifting device, a mechanism for walking on the water's surface and a control system. The solar power supply device provides power for the machine, and the water walking mechanism drives the machine's motion on the water. The sediment lifting device orbits the main section of the machine and affects a large area of the pond. Tests of the machine's mechanical properties revealed that the minimum illumination necessary for the SMWM to function is 13,000 Lx and that its stable speed on the water is 0.02-0.03 m/s. For an illumination of 13,000-52,500 Lx, the sediment lifting device runs at 0.13-0.35 m/s, and its water delivery capacity is 110-208 m(3)/h. The sediment lifting device is able to fold away, and the angle of the suction chamber can be adjusted, making the machine work well in ponds at different water depths from 0.5 m to 2 m. The optimal distance from the sediment lifting device to the bottom of the pond is 10-15 cm. In addition, adjusting the length of the connecting rod and the direction of the traction rope allows the SMWM to work in a pond water area greater than 80%. The analysis of water quality in Wuchang bream (Parabramis pekinensis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) culture ponds using the SMWM resulted in decreased NH3(+)-N and available phosphorus concentrations and increased TP concentrations. The TN content and the amount of available phosphorus in the sediment were reduced. In addition, the fish production showed that the SMWM enhanced the yields of Wuchang bream and silver carp by more than 30% and 24%, respectively. These results indicate that the SMWM may be suitable for Wuchang bream pond aquaculture in China and that it can be used in pond aquaculture for regulating and controlling water quality."
https://openalex.org/W2253394210,"Hair cycle disturbances are common in dogs and comparable to some alopecic disorders in humans. A normal hair cycle is maintained by follicular stem cells which are predominately found in an area known as the bulge. Due to similar morphological characteristics of the bulge area in humans and dogs, the shared particularity of compound hair follicles as well as similarities in follicular biomarker expression, the dog is a promising model to study human hair cycle and stem cell disorders. To gain insight into the spatial distribution of follicular keratinocytes with stem cell potential in canine compound follicles, we microdissected hair follicles in anagen and telogen from skin samples of freshly euthanized dogs. The keratinocytes isolated from different locations were investigated for their colony forming efficiency, growth and differentiation potential as well as clonal growth. Our results indicate that i) compound and single hair follicles exhibit a comparable spatial distribution pattern with respect to cells with high growth potential and stem cell-like characteristics, ii) the lower isthmus (comprising the bulge) harbors most cells with high growth potential in both, the anagen and the telogen hair cycle stage, iii) unlike in other species, colonies with highest growth potential are rather small with an irregular perimeter and iv) the keratinocytes derived from the bulbar region exhibit characteristics of actively dividing transit amplifying cells. Our results now provide the basis to conduct comparative studies of normal dogs and those with hair cycle disorders with the possibility to extend relevant findings to human patients."
https://openalex.org/W2297203620,"In this study, we applied the text-change paradigm to investigate whether and how discourse hierarchy affected the memory representation of a discourse. Three kinds of three-sentence discourses were constructed. In the hierarchy-high condition and the hierarchy-low condition, the three sentences of the discourses were hierarchically organized and the last sentence of each discourse was located at the high level and the low level of the discourse hierarchy, respectively. In the linear condition, the three sentences of the discourses were linearly organized. Critical words were always located at the last sentence of the discourses. These discourses were successively presented twice and the critical words were changed to semantically related words in the second presentation. The results showed that during the early processing stage, the critical words were read for longer times when they were changed in the hierarchy-high and the linear conditions, but not in the hierarchy-low condition. During the late processing stage, the changed-critical words were again found to induce longer reading times only when they were in the hierarchy-high condition. These results suggest that words in a discourse have better memory representation when they are located at the higher rather than at the lower level of the discourse hierarchy. Global discourse hierarchy is established as an important factor in constructing the mental representation of a discourse."
