https://openalex.org/W2058880763,"The recycling of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) from the cell surface via the endocytic pathways plays a key role in the generation of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in Alzheimer disease. We report here that inherited variants in the SORL1 neuronal sorting receptor are associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease. These variants, which occur in at least two different clusters of intronic sequences within the SORL1 gene (also known as LR11 or SORLA) may regulate tissue-specific expression of SORL1. We also show that SORL1 directs trafficking of APP into recycling pathways and that when SORL1 is underexpressed, APP is sorted into Aβ-generating compartments. These data suggest that inherited or acquired changes in SORL1 expression or function are mechanistically involved in causing Alzheimer disease."
https://openalex.org/W2146037001,"Recent anatomical, physiological, and neuroimaging findings indicate multisensory convergence at early, putatively unisensory stages of cortical processing. The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in A1 and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area A1 in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in A1 indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect."
https://openalex.org/W2095091733,"The naturally occurring regulatory T cell (T(r)) is the pivotal cell type that maintains self-tolerance and exerts active immune suppression. The development and function of T(r) cells is controlled by Foxp3 (refs 1, 2), a lack of which results in loss of T(r) cells and massive multi-organ autoimmunity in scurfy mice and IPEX (immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked) patients. It is generally thought that, through a binary mechanism, Foxp3 expression serves as an on-and-off switch to regulate positively the physiology of T(r) cells; however, emerging evidence associates decreased Foxp3 expression in T(r) cells with various immune disorders. We hypothesized that Foxp3 regulates T(r) cell development and function in a dose-dependent, non-binary manner, and that decreased Foxp3 expression can cause immune disease. Here, by generating a mouse model in which endogenous Foxp3 gene expression is attenuated in T(r) cells, we show that decreased Foxp3 expression results in the development of an aggressive autoimmune syndrome similar to that of scurfy mice, but does not affect thymic development, homeostatic expansion/maintenance or transforming-growth-factor-beta-induced de novo generation of Foxp3-expressing cells. The immune-suppressive activities of T cells with attenuated Foxp3 expression were nearly abolished in vitro and in vivo, whereas their anergic properties in vitro were maintained. This was accompanied by decreased expression of T(r) cell 'signature genes'. Notably, T cells expressing decreased Foxp3 preferentially became T-helper 2 (T(h)2)-type effectors even in a T(h)1-polarizing environment. These cells instructed T(h)2 differentiation of conventional T cells, which contributed to the immune diseases observed in these mice. Thus, decreased Foxp3 expression causes immune disease by subverting the suppressive function of T(r) cells and converting T(r) cells into effector cells; these findings are important for understanding the regulation of T(r) cell function and the aetiology of various human immune diseases."

This suggests an abstract coding of numerical magnitude. Here, we critically tested this hypothesis using fMRI adaptation to demonstrate notation-independent coding of numerical quantity in the hIPS. Once subjects were adapted either to dot patterns or to Arabic digits, activation in the hIPS and in frontal regions recovered in a distance-dependent fashion whenever a new number was presented, irrespective of notation changes. This remained unchanged when analyzing the hIPS peaks from an independent localizer scan of mental calculation. These results suggest an abstract coding of approximate number common to dots, digits, and number words. They support the idea that symbols acquire meaning by linking neural populations coding symbol shapes to those holding nonsymbolic representations of quantities.

These results suggest an abstract coding of approximate number common to dots, digits, and number words. They support the idea that symbols acquire meaning by linking neural populations coding symbol shapes to those holding nonsymbolic representations of quantities. Numerical quantities, like many other categories of concepts, can be expressed symbolically or analogically. The numerical quantity 3, for example, can be expressed symbolically by the digit 3 or by the spoken or written word “three.” It can also be conveyed in concrete form by a set of three visual objects, a sequence of three tones, or three self-generated movements. Are the neural populations that extract and represent the cardinality of a given set (numerosity) also involved in representing the meaning of a given numerical symbol? It has been proposed that, in the course of learning to speak, read, or write, children learn to map spoken and written numerals onto a core representation of numerosity in the intraparietal sulcus (Butterworth, 1999Butterworth B. The Mathematical Brain. Macmillan, London1999Google Scholar, Dehaene, 1997Dehaene S. The Number Sense. Oxford University Press, New York1997Google Scholar). It is likely that symbolic and concrete depictions of number are linked together in the adult human brain, perhaps in the form of notation-independent assemblies of neurons coding for number at a purely conceptual level (cardinality). The goal of the present study is to put this hypothesis to a critical test using fMRI adaptation. Recent research has suggested that concepts of number form a semantic category which dissociates from other categories of concepts (for example colors, living things, or tools). In neuropsychology, a double dissociation exists between numbers and other semantic categories. On the one hand, there are patients (with cortical atrophy mainly of temporal lobes) with heavily deteriorated semantic processing but spared calculation and number comprehension (Butterworth et al., 2001Butterworth B.

On the other hand, there are patients (mainly with lesions or atrophy in the parietal cortex) that show impaired understanding of numbers but otherwise preserved knowledge of other semantic domains (Cipolotti et al., 1991Cipolotti L.

Functional imaging techniques have also revealed some degree of segregation between numbers and other categories such as animals and colors (Eger et al., 2003Eger E. Sterzer P. Russ M.O. Giraud A.L.

Furthermore, they have helped clarify the organization of number-related processes in the parietal lobe. fMRI studies have suggested a crucial role of regions situated along the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) of both hemispheres for the representation of numerical quantities (Dehaene et al., 2003Dehaene S. Piazza M. Pinel P. Cohen L. Three parietal circuits for number processing.Cogn. Neuropsychol. 2003; 20: 487-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Independent lines of research have pointed to parietal cortex as crucial for coding numerical quantity both when it is conveyed by number symbols (digits, number words; Eger et al., 2003Eger E.

Those results have been taken to imply that the hIPS contains a modality-independent quantity representation. However, symbolic and nonsymbolic quantities were often tested in different experimental settings and subjects; only one recent fMRI study showed common activations in the anterior IPS bilaterally, left posterior IPS, medial frontal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus for symbolic and nonsymbolic addition (Venkatraman et al., 2005Venkatraman V. Ansari D. Chee M.W. Neural correlates of symbolic and nonsymbolic arithmetic.Neuropsychologia. 2005; 43: 744-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Most crucially, coactivation of the same voxels need not imply a common neural code but might simply be due to the activation of distinct neural populations intermixed at the same cortical location (Cohen Kadosh et al., 2005Cohen Kadosh R. Henik A. Rubinsten O. Mohr H. Dori H. van de Ven V. Zorzi M. Hendler T. Goebel R. Linden D.E. Are numbers special?

Another line of research pointing to a possible convergence of symbolic and nonsymbolic representations of numbers arises from chronometric investigations. Evidence from the number comparison task has suggested that the internal metrics governing the mental representation of nonsymbolic quantities and of numerical symbols are similar. In both cases, response times and error rates show numerical distance and numerical magnitude effects: numerical judgments become more difficult when the numerical distance between two values decreases, and this effect is exacerbated as their absolute magnitude increases (Buckley and Gillman, 1974Buckley P.B.

Psychol. 1975; 7: 82-138Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Such effects are captured by Weber's law, which states that the threshold of discrimination between two stimuli scales with their magnitude. They point to an internal coding of number by a distribution of activation on an internal compressed number “line” or “scale.” These observations led some authors to the conclusion that symbolic and nonsymbolic notations converge onto a common format of representation (Buckley and Gillman, 1974Buckley P.B. Gillman C.B. Comparison of digits and dot patterns.J. Exp. Psychol. 1974; 103: 1131-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, Dehaene et al., 1998Dehaene S. Dehaene-Lambertz G. Cohen L.

Once again, however, such behavioral evidence is indirect in nature and leaves open the possibility that there are two separate systems for representing symbolic and nonsymbolic numerical magnitudes that are simply governed by a similar metric. Indeed, magnitude effects are shared properties of a great variety of mental representations (e.g., size, sound intensity, etc.) that probably have little in common (Cohen Kadosh et al., 2005Cohen Kadosh R. Henik A. Rubinsten O. Mohr H. Dori H. van de Ven V. Zorzi M. Hendler T. Goebel R. Linden D.E. Are numbers special?

To directly evaluate the presence of an abstract, notation-independent code for numerical magnitude in the hIPS, we measured brain activity with fMRI while 14 healthy volunteers passively observed both nonsymbolic (dot patterns) and symbolic (Arabic digits) numbers. Using an adaptation paradigm, we investigated whether a region in the bilateral intraparietal sulcui adapts to approximate quantity and shows crossnotation recovery whenever the number changes. Previous research has shown number-related adaptation in the hIPS, both in adults and in 4-year-old subjects for numbers presented as sets of dots (Ansari et al., 2006Ansari D. Dhital B. Siong S.C.

Furthermore, Naccache and Dehaene, 2001Naccache L. Dehaene S. The priming method: imaging unconscious repetition priming reveals an abstract representation of number in the parietal lobes.Cereb. Cortex. 2001; 11: 966-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar demonstrated subliminal fMRI repetition priming across Arabic digits and written words. The key addition of the present study is to test whether those symbolic and nonsymbolic adaptation effects occur at a shared level of parietal representation. For each subject, we also acquired a short localizer scan to identify regions active during symbolic mental calculation (subtractions of numbers presented visually or auditory). This localizer scan provided an independent definition of intraparietal regions of interest, where we investigated the presence of fMRI adaptation effects. During short (2 min) sequences, participants were passively exposed to a fixed set of numerical quantities, all very close to a given value (e.g., 17, 18, or 19; see Figure 1). In a given sequence, these adaptation numerosities were presented in a fixed notation, either as Arabic digits or as sets of dots. Recovery from adaptation was investigated at two different temporal scales (Figure 2). First, after two minutes of adaptation with a fixed approximate quantity (hereafter called period A1), the adaptation numerosities changed abruptly (e.g., to 47, 48, or 49), with or without a concomittent change in notation, and remained approximately fixed for another 2 min period (hereafter called period A2). We examined whether this unforeseen change led to a durable rebound in the fMRI signal. Second, within each block, following a fixed adaptation part, sparse deviant stimuli were occasionally introduced. We examined whether each deviant event led to a local response dependent on the distance between the adaptation and deviant values. Crucially, all combinations of adaptation and deviant notations were used, resulting in two within-notation conditions (dots-to-dots and Arabic-to-Arabic) as well as two crossnotation conditions (dots-to-Arabic and Arabic-to-dots).Figure 2General Structure of Each Experimental Block and Example of Specific StimuliShow full captionEach block comprised two successive adaptation sequences (A1 and A2). Within each sequence, the first 25 stimuli always presented the designated adaptation numbers. Deviants then occurred at pseudorandom moments (12 deviants amongst 60 adaptation stimuli). Each sequence ended with six trials with adaptation numbers only. At the transition between the sequences A1 and A2, the adaptation numbers abruptly changed without any break or warning. On half such transitions, notation also changed. The example (bottom) depicts a case in which adaptation stimuli in both A1 and A2 are Arabic numerals in the range 17–19 in A1 and in the range 47–49 in A2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Each block comprised two successive adaptation sequences (A1 and A2).

The example (bottom) depicts a case in which adaptation stimuli in both A1 and A2 are Arabic numerals in the range 17–19 in A1 and in the range 47–49 in A2. To investigate the presence of adaptation, we searched for regions where activity decreased linearly during the first 30 s of periods A1 and A2, both after rest and after a change in number (see Figure 2, Figure 3). Regions showing number-related decreasing activity were mostly observed in bilateral parietal and frontal cortices, with additional effects in occipito-temporal, cerebrellar, and subcortical thalamic regions (Table 1). Given our a priori focus on parietal cortex (Piazza and Dehaene, 2004Piazza M. Dehaene S. From number neurons to mental arithmetic: the cognitive neuroscience of number sense.in: Gazzaniga M.

Figure 3 shows the time course of the BOLD signal in those voxels, averaged across hemispheres. The plot revealed that number-related adaptation in the parietal cortex is a slow, continuous process that takes several tens of seconds: activation continued to drop during the entire period where a given approximate numerical magnitude was repeated, both after rest and after a recovery from adaptation due to a change in number. The activation attained its peak around 10 s after the stimuli onset and then slowly decreased down to a minimum about 26 s after the peak. The adaptation effect was then tested statistically by comparing, across subjects, the mean activation in three time windows of 12 s: during baseline, around the peak, and at the end of the adaptation sequence. This analysis showed a significant increase after rest (paired t test T(13) = 5.11, p < 0.001) and a significant decrease of the activation during the last adaptation period compared to activity around the peak (T(13) = 3.02, p < 0.01).Table 1Regions Showing an Overall fMRI Adaptation Effect (Decreasing Activation with Repetition of the Same Approximate Quantity during the First 30 s of Periods A1 and A2)xyzZ ScoreCortical Region−34−54444.87Left parietal−20−6842−32−644034−64544.19Right parietal34−585046−4640−28−64−324.46Left cerebellum36−72−264.64Right cerebellum−34−80−23.46Left occipital24−8044.20Right occipital36−46−203.60Right inferior temporal−36−60−143.44Left inferior temporal−5424303.51Left DLPF3826204.50Right DLPFC−14−223.43Putamen14−203.35 Open table in a new tab The activation profile of parietal peaks in Figure 3 suggests a rebound effect, with a sudden recovery of the fMRI signal after a change in the adaptation numbers (from A1 to A2), followed by a new period of adaptation during the subsequent repetitions of those new numbers. We compared, across subjects, the mean signal averaged over the 12 s before the change in number with the mean signal average over the first 12 s after the change in number. This analysis showed a statistically significant increase in activation (T(13) = −2.14, p < 0.05). The adaptation effect, a subsequent decrease in activation, was also highly significant (t test comparing the activity during the first and the last 12 s of the initial deviant-free period of A2, T(13) = 4.93, p < 0.001). To further explore this rebound effect across our experimental conditions, we then isolated, for each subject, within the two IP regions identified by the group analysis, the voxel where the overall largest fMRI rebound signal was observed. The amount of rebound was quantified as the slope of a linear regression between the bold signal and a linearly decreasing vector going from 1 to −1 over the 30 s deviant-free section of period A2. An ANOVA with A1 notation and A2 notation as dependent variables, showed that rebound was invariant to notation (effect of A2 notation, left, F(1,13) = 0.4, p = 0.54; right, F(1,13) = 0.09, p = 0.77; effect of A1 notation, left, F(1,13) = 0.05, p = 0.83; right, F(1,13) = 0.13, p = 0.73) and also, crucially, invariant to changes in notation (A1∗A2 notation interaction, left, F(1,13) = 1.16, p = 0.3; right, F(1,13) = 0.54, p = 0.47). In other words, the increased activity due to a change in number was identical with or without a concomitant change in notation (e.g., from Arabic digits to sets of dots, from sets of dots to Arabic digits, or within each notation; see Figure 4). This observation provides a first piece of evidence for an abstract coding of approximate number in the parietal cortex. At this level of analysis, our design, in order to spare experimental time, did not incorporate a control condition where the transition between A1 and A2 was not accompanied by a change in number. Nevertheless, on same-notation trials, the number changed without any warning or any break in the stimulus sequence. It thus seems unlikely that the rebound would have occurred spontaneously at this precise moment in time, if it was not related specifically to the change in number. More unambiguous evidence for an abstract numerical effect came from an analysis of the local event-related recovery from adaptation during the presentation of rare (deviant) stimuli in the second part of periods A1 and A2. Although the deviants always differed in number from the adaptation stimuli, the distance between the deviant and the adaptation numbers was either very small (a distance of an average of 2 units ±1) or large (32 ± 1 units; see Figure 1). We reasoned that presenting an occasional deviant number should lead to a local recovery of fMRI responses only if the deviant differed from the adaptation value by a sufficiently large amount. Based on our prior results with nonsymbolic stimuli, which indicate a Gaussian profile of recovery from adaptation in the hIPS, we expected little or no recovery for close deviants but a large recovery effect for far deviants. Accordingly, we looked for regions that responded more to large distances than to small ones. In a whole-brain search, this analysis revealed mostly a bilateral fronto-parietal-cerebellar network (Table 2 and Figure 5). No brain region was more active for number change than for notation change. In the converse direction, notation change yielded a supplemental increased activation in bilateral inferior and middle occipito-temporal cortex (Table 3), probably reflecting adaptation to the very different overall shapes of digits and dot patterns (Grill-Spector et al., 1999Grill-Spector K.

To study whether and how numerical coding in the IPS was modulated by the format of presentation of the numbers we isolated, for each subject, within the two IPS regions identified by the group analysis, the voxel where the largest fMRI response to numerical distance was found (mean and SD of the coordinates across subjects = −32(5), −57(6), 46(10) in the left hemisphere and 46(4), −42(5), 47(6) in the right hemisphere). We then plotted activation in these voxels as a function of our experimental conditions (see Figure 5). In both hemispheres, overall activation was higher when the numerical distance between deviant and adaptation values was large than when it was small (main effect of numerical distance F(1,13) = 73.48, p < 0.000 and F(1,13) = 74.74, p < 0.000 for the left and right hemispheres, respectively). Moreover, adaptation and deviant notation interacted (F(1,13) = 37.6, p < 0.000 for the left and F(1,13) = 11.45, p < 0.005 for the right hemisphere), indicating that changing notation also had an effect on the activity of IP cortex. However, importantly, in the right hemisphere the effect of numerical distance did not interact either with deviant notation or with adaptation notation (p > 0.1), indicating that the effect of number change and of notation change are additive. In the left hemisphere, a large change in number generally yielded stronger activation than a small change (see Figure 5), but there was an exception when deviant dots were presented among digits. This was reflected in a triple interaction of adaptation notation, deviant notation, and numerical distance (F(1,13) = 8.00, p < 0.05). When deviant dots were presented among digits, there was a large recovery from adaptation even for small numerical distances, contrary to the symmetrical situation where deviant digits were presented among dots for which a small numerical distance did not yield recovery from adaptation. In order to visualize this effect more easily, we calculated and plotted for each subject and hemisphere the size of the distance effect (the difference between the activation of far versus close deviants; see Figure 5C). A paired t test confirmed that in the left hemisphere the distance effect for dots amongst digits was smaller than in the right hemisphere (T(13) = −1.87, p < 0.05), where it did not differ in size from the other conditions. This effect was small but present in 10 out of 14 subjects (70%). It was only found by the region-of-interest method, as no other region showed a significant interaction of distance and notation in the whole-brain analysis. In the discussion, we consider a tentative interpretation of this unexpected asymmetric adaptation effect in terms of the degree of precision of the internal representations of symbolic and nonsymbolic quantities (Verguts and Fias, 2004Verguts T. Fias W. Representation of number in animals and humans: a neural model.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2004; 16: 1493-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Most importantly, however, for the issue of notation-independent coding is the fact that distance-dependent crossnotation fMRI recovery was significant in both left and right parietal cortices when deviant digits were presented amongst dots (t(13) = 3.99, p < 0.01 and t(13) = 3.64, p < 0.01, for the left and right parietal cortices, respectively). These results show that the magnitude code of the parietal cortices is common to numerosities and numerical symbols. While"

To understand LTM, we must understand how memory traces persist over time despite the short-lived nature and rapid turnover of their molecular substrates. It is widely accepted that LTM formation is dependent upon hippocampal de novo protein synthesis and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling during or early after acquisition. Here we show that 12 hr after acquisition of a one-trial associative learning task, there is a novel protein synthesis and BDNF-dependent phase in the rat hippocampus that is critical for the persistence of LTM storage. Our findings indicate that a delayed stabilization phase is specifically required for maintenance, but not formation, of the memory trace. We propose that memory formation and memory persistence share some of the same molecular mechanisms and that recurrent rounds of consolidation-like events take place in the hippocampus for maintenance of the memory trace.

We propose that memory formation and memory persistence share some of the same molecular mechanisms and that recurrent rounds of consolidation-like events take place in the hippocampus for maintenance of the memory trace. Learning is the process by which we and other organisms acquire information about the world. Memory is the storage of that information. In 1900, Muller and Pilzecker proposed that the formation of permanent memory takes time and that during this time, memory remains vulnerable to disruption (McGaugh, 1966McGaugh J.L. Time-dependent processes in memory storage.Science. 1966; 153: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Muller and Pilzecker, 1900Muller G.E. Pilzecker A. Experimentelle Beiträge zur Lehre vom Gedächtnis.Z. Psychol. Ergänzungsband. 1900; 1: 1-300Google Scholar). The process of developing stable memory is referred to as consolidation. During the last 40 years, a great body of evidence has uncovered many aspects of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in memory formation and consolidation (Kandel, 2001Kandel E.R. The molecular biology of memory storage: a dialogue between genes and synapses.Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, McGaugh, 1966McGaugh J.L.

Memory–a century of consolidation.Science. 2000; 287: 248-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Memory can be divided into at least two phases: a protein and RNA synthesis-independent phase that lasts minutes to 1–3 hr (short-term memory) and a protein and mRNA synthesis-dependent phase that lasts several hours to days, weeks, or even longer (long-term memory, or LTM) (Davis and Squire, 1984Davis H.P.

Memory–a century of consolidation.Science. 2000; 287: 248-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a definite property of LTM is its sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibitors. During memory formation, protein synthesis is thought to be required to transform newly learned information into stable synaptic modifications (Davis and Squire, 1984Davis H.P. Squire L.R.

Memory–a century of consolidation.Science. 2000; 287: 248-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many behavioral studies in different animal species have demonstrated that LTM requires de novo protein synthesis around the time of training or during the first few hours posttraining (Bourtchouladze et al., 1998Bourtchouladze R.

However, the involvement of macromolecular synthesis in LTM at longer time delays has not been thoroughly explored so far. Regulation of the expression of several proteins has been associated with the learning process. One molecule that has been proven to be necessary for memory formation in different learning tasks is Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which is a small dimeric protein widely expressed in the adult mammalian brain. BDNF has been extensively implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory processing, and it has been demonstrated to be essential for the development of the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) (Kang et al., 1997Kang H.

Importantly, this molecule has been implicated in the modulation of synapse formation and dendritic spine growth in the hippocampus (Bamji et al., 2006Bamji S.X. Rico B. Kimes N. Reichardt L.F.

In particular, endogenous BDNF is required for LTM formation of inhibitory avoidance in the rat hippocampus and parietal cortex (Alonso et al., 2002Alonso M. Vianna M.R. Depino A.M. Mello e Souza T. Pereira P. Szapiro G. Viola H. Pitossi F. Izquierdo I. Medina J.H.

Mem. 2005; 12: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Little is known about the cellular and molecular processes that continue for several hours or days after learning to mediate persistence, a key feature of LTM. With the exception of a few examples (Riedel et al., 1999Riedel G. Micheau J. Lam A.G. Roloff E.L. Martin S.J. Bridge H. de Hoz L. Poeschel B. McCulloch J. Morris R.G.

NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic reinforcement as a crucial process for memory consolidation.Science. 2000; 290: 1170-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), most studies have evaluated the effect of pre- or posttraining treatments on LTM measured 24 hr after training. However, memories may last days, months, or even a lifetime. So, for them to become long-lasting, changes must persist after acquisition in order to render the memory trace immune to molecular turnover (Bailey et al., 2004Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Si K.

Memory–a century of consolidation.Science. 2000; 287: 248-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the question of memory persistence remains central in understanding the neurobiology of learning and memory. Recent studies have started to address this issue of memory persistence, focusing mainly on the neocortex as the region of permanent memory storage (Bontempi et al., 1999Bontempi B. Laurent-Demir C.

Menzaghi F. Bontempi B. Sites of neocortical reorganization critical for remote spatial memory.Science. 2004; 305: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). On the other hand, few works have assessed the involvement of the hippocampus in this process (Cui et al., 2004Cui Z. Wang H. Tan Y. Zaia K.A. Zhang S. Tsien J.Z. Inducible and reversible NR1 knockout reveals crucial role of the NMDA receptor in preserving remote memories in the brain.Neuron. 2004; 41: 781-793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Riedel et al., 1999Riedel G.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This is probably because, based on lesion experiments, the hippocampus appears to have a temporary role in memory storage (Anagnostaras et al., 1999Anagnostaras S.G. Maren S. Fanselow M.S. Temporally graded retrograde amnesia of contextual fear after hippocampal damage in rats: within-subjects examination.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1106-1114PubMed Google Scholar, Brown, 2002Brown A.S.

The primate hippocampal formation: evidence for a time-limited role in memory storage.Science. 1990; 250: 288-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that protein synthesis and BDNF signaling are crucially involved in LTM formation, and that BDNF is known to promote morphological changes at the synapse that could underlie memory maintenance (Barco et al., 2006Barco A. Bailey C.H. Kandel E.R. Common molecular mechanisms in explicit and implicit memory.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1520-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2004Lamprecht R. LeDoux J. Structural plasticity and memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to investigate whether protein synthesis and BDNF-mediated signaling in the hippocampus are also required for persistence of LTM storage at a time when these processes are no longer necessary for LTM formation. Here we show for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) that de novo protein synthesis and BDNF expression and activity are engaged in the hippocampus during a restricted time window after LTM has already formed in order to ensure successful storage for memory persistence over days. We propose that memory formation and memory persistence share some of the same molecular mechanisms and that recurrent rounds of consolidation-like events take place in the hippocampus for maintenance of the memory trace. To study persistence of memory storage, rats were submitted to a one-trial inhibitory avoidance training (IA) task, a hippocampus-dependent learning task (Izquierdo et al., 2006Izquierdo I.

In the training session a rat was placed on a platform located in the training apparatus. The animal explored the platform for a few seconds and then stepped down onto a grid where it received a 3 s mild foot-shock. During the test session, LTM (conventionally measured 24 hr after training) was assessed as the time the animal spent on the platform before stepping down. The use of protein synthesis inhibitors has been fundamental for the development of the hypothesis that macromolecular synthesis is required for LTM (Davis and Squire, 1984Davis H.P. Squire L.R. Protein synthesis and memory: a review.Psychol. Bull. 1984; 96: 518-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, Kandel, 2001Kandel E.R. The molecular biology of memory storage: a dialogue between genes and synapses.Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar), and for a long time it yielded the sole evidence for the participation of de novo protein synthesis in the learning process. In recent years this assumption has been further confirmed through the use of molecular and genetic approaches (Abel and Lattal, 2001Abel T. Lattal K.M. Molecular mechanisms of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 180-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors on learning has been extremely consistent among different learning tasks and species. Therefore, protein synthesis inhibitors are still the best tools to examine the “when” and the “where” of protein synthesis requirements for learning and memory. To test whether hippocampal de novo protein synthesis is required for the persistence of IA memory, we injected the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (Ani) into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus (Figure 1), an area of the brain extensively implicated in memory processing and known to be essential for IA LTM formation (Igaz et al., 2002Igaz L.M.

Although the exact composition of these channels is not yet established, TRPC1 contributes to SOC channels and regulation of physiological function of a variety of cell types. Recently, Orai1 and STIM1 have been suggested to be sufficient for generating CRAC channels. Here we show that Orai1 and STIM1 are also required for TRPC1-SOC channels. Knockdown of TRPC1, Orai1, or STIM1 attenuated, whereas overexpression of TRPC1, but not Orai1 or STIM1, induced an increase in SOC entry and ISOC in human salivary gland cells. All three proteins were co-localized in the plasma membrane region of cells, and thapsigargin increased co-immunoprecipitation of TRPC1 with STIM1, and Orai1 in human salivary gland cells as well as dispersed mouse submandibular gland cells. In aggregate, the data presented here reveal that all three proteins are essential for generation of ISOC in these cells and that dynamic assembly of TRPC1-STIM1-Orai1 ternary complex is involved in activation of SOC channel in response to internal Ca2+ store depletion.

SOCE is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types and critically regulates a variety of cellular functions ranging from T-lymphocyte activation, smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, fluid and protein secretion, to regulation of cell growth and proliferation (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol.

Despite intense focus on SOCE over the past two decades neither the mechanism(s) by which the status of Ca2+ in the ER is transmitted to the plasma membrane, to activate or inactivate SOC channels, nor the molecular components of the channels have yet been identified. Interestingly, the characteristics of these channels in different cell types are quite distinct, suggesting diversity in the channel components (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 4Beech D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Bolotina V.M. Sci.

The first SOC channel to be identified was the highly Ca2+-selective, calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, which is found in T-lymphocytes, RBL, and other hematopoietic cells (7Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 8Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). However, similar measurements in other cell types such as salivary gland, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells have demonstrated the presence of different types SOC channels, which range from non-selective to relatively Ca2+-selective (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 4Beech D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2005; 451: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 5Bolotina V.M.

Although the physiological significance of such diversity in SOC channels is not clear, it is important to consider whether all these channels are activated by the same signal generated in response to internal Ca2+ store depletion or whether internal Ca2+ store depletion induces multiple intracellular signals that act on different channels. Members of the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) family of channels have been proposed as components of SOC channels (2Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar, 3Venkatachalam K. van Rossum D.B. Patterson R.L. Ma H.T. Gill D.L. Nat.

Although several TRPC members, e.g. TRPC4, TRPC3, and TRPC7, have been reported to be activated by internal Ca2+ store depletion, the data are most consistent for TRPC1. This protein has been shown to be required for SOCE in several different cell types, including salivary gland, HEK293, smooth muscle, endothelial, DT 40 cells, and platelets (4Beech D.J.

These findings have been further substantiated by studies demonstrating that TRPC1 contributes to the Ca2+ permeability of SOC channels in several cell types, including salivary gland and smooth muscle cells (2Parekh A.B.

With the exception of a few studies that implicate TRPCs in CRAC function in lymphocytes (7Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 8Parekh A.B.

Recently two new proteins have emerged as candidate components of SOCE: STIM1 and Orai1. STIM1 is a single-transmembrane protein that has an unpaired EF-hand domain in the N terminus, which has been predicted to be localized in the ER lumen (19Williams R.T. Senior P.V. Van Stekelenburg L. Layton J.E. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Knockdown of STIM1 expression using siRNA significantly reduced SOCE in HEK293, SH-SY5Y, Jurkat T, and HeLa cells (20Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr.

Cahalan M.D. Velicelebi G. Stauderman K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of STIM1 only modestly enhanced SOCE in HEK293 cells (22Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Additionally, STIM1 was relocalized into punctae in the subplasma membrane region following stimulation by thapsigargin (Tg) (20Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). The EF-hand domain of STIM1 has been suggested to function as the ER-Ca2+ sensor regulating SOCE (20Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which STIM1 regulates SOCE is not yet known. The second protein, Orai1, is a four-transmembrane domain protein that was initially suggested to be a plasma membrane-localized regulatory protein for ICRAC. Mutations in Orai1 have been genetically linked to severe combined immunodeficiency, and T-lymphocytes isolated from patients with severe combined immunodeficiency displayed decreased ICRAC activity (23Feske S.

Knockdown of Orai1 decreases SOCE, whereas expression of Orai1 with mutations in conserved negatively charged residues changes the Ca2+ selectivity of CRAC channel (24Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W.

Because Orai1 and STIM1 can reconstitute the ICRAC current, it has been suggested that they are sufficient for the formation of this channel. We have previously reported that TRPC1 is an essential component of the SOC channels in salivary gland cells (13Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. O'Connell B. Wellner R. Zhu M.X.

Our data demonstrated that knockdown of TRPC1 decreases SOCE, overexpression increases the activity, whereas expression of TRPC1 with mutations in the proposed pore region of this protein alters the Ca2+ permeability of the channel. In the present study, we have investigated the possible role of STIM1 and Orai1 in TRPC1-dependent SOCE. The data presented here reveal that all three proteins are essential for generation of TRPC1-SOC channels. We show that STIM1 regulation of TRPC1-SOC is similar to its regulation of ICRAC. Further, we report that dynamic assembly of a TRPC1-STIM1-Orai1 complex is involved in activation of Ca2+ entry. These data reveal common components of SOC and CRAC channels that contribute toward their store-dependent regulation and function.

Sequences of primers (Integrated DNA Technologies), used to detect the Orai1 transcript, were as follows: 5′-CAGCAGCCAACGTCAGCACCA-3′ and 3′-CAGCTGGTCCTGTAAGCGGGCAAA-5′. In Fig. 1, -ve control indicates the buffer control, whereas +ve control indicates the human cDNA aliquot provided in the RT-PCR kit, FastStart High Fidelity PCR system from Roche Applied Sciences. The PCR product was sequenced and confirmed to be the Orai1 transcript. [Ca2+]i Measurements—Measurements of [Ca2+]i were performed by imaging Fura-2AM-loaded cells using an Olympus 50× microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA), with an ORCA-ER camera (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan) attached to a Polychrome IV (Till Photonics LLC, Pleasanton, CA). MetaFluor (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) was used to acquire images and processing the data. Other details have been provided elsewhere (33Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Singh B.B. Groschner K.

In the case of transfected cells, green fluorescent protein was used to select the transfected cells. Measurements were made in standard extracellular solution (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (NaOH)) with additions of Ca2+ as indicated (16Liu X. Singh B.B.

Relative changes in 340/380 ratios (representing [Ca2+]i) are shown in the figures (traces are average of at least 50-100 cells in each experiment). Electrophysiological Measurements—Whole cell-attached patch clamp measurement was performed using Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices) as described previously (6Liu X. Groschner K.

Patch pipette resistance was 3-6 mΩ filled with the following solution: 145 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2 (CsOH). SOCE was activated by either including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (10 μm) in the pipette solution or by including Tg (1 μm) in the external solution (as indicated in the figures). Standard external solution was used with 10 mm CaCl2. For Na+ current measurements the external solution (divalent cation-free) was composed as follows: 165 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (NaOH). Development of the current was assessed from the current amplitudes at potentials of -80 mV and +80 mV recorded during voltage ramps ranging from -90 to 90 mV (over a period of 1 s, imposed every 4 s) from a holding potential of 0 mV, and digitized at a rate of 1 kHz. A liquid-junction potential of less than 8 mV was not corrected, capacitative currents and series resistance were determined and minimized. The first ramp was used for leak subtraction in the subsequent current records. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells, grown to 80% confluence, were harvested, and crude membrane fraction (used where indicated) was prepared as described previously (33Liu X.

Where indicated, band intensities were quantified in an image analyzer, Gel Doc™ XR, using Quality One software (Bio-Rad). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses in this and other experiments were done using Student's t test. Purification of GST-N- and GST-C-TRPC1 Proteins and GST Pull-down Assays—The N and C termini of TRPC1 were cloned into pGEX5.1 (Amersham Biosciences) vector and expressed as a GST fusion protein. GST pull-down assays were conducted as described previously (33Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Singh B.B. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, 500 ml of Escherichia coli (BL-21) expressing either GST or GST-N-TRPC1 or GST-C-TRPC1 protein were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Proteins were purified after lysing the cells by French press at 1200 pounds/square inch. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a GST-agarose affinity column, washed five times with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors, and eluted using 10 mm reduced glutathione. 2.2 μm of the individual GST-purified proteins were incubated with 500 μg of HSG cell lysates (lysed either using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer or octylglucoside plus 500 mm potassium iodide containing proteolytic inhibitors; see Refs. 33Liu X.

Interacting proteins were pulled down using 100 μl of GST beads, washed five times with high salt buffer, and incubated with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, and Western blots were performed as described above. Preparation of Dispersed Mouse Submandibular Gland Cells—Cells were prepared from the mouse submandibular gland as described previously (31Singh B.B. Zheng C. Liu X. Lockwich T. Liao D. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1652-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, submandibular glands were removed, cleaned, minced, and digested in standard extracellular solution buffer containing 0.02% soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1% bovine serum albumin containing collagenase P (2.5 mg/8 ml) for 15-20 min at 37 °C, washed twice with the external solution, and resuspended in 5 ml of standard extracellular solution buffer. The cell suspension was then treated with Tg for 60 s and centrifuged, and the pellets were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were obtained after centrifugation, precleared, and used for immunoprecipitation as above. All mice were maintained according to guidelines approved by the NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Animal Care and Use Committee. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (31Singh B.B. Zheng C. Liu X. Lockwich T. Liao D. Zhu M.X. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S.

Samples were washed and then treated with Cy5- and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-tagged secondary antibodies as required (1:100 dilution). Images were collected using a Leica confocal microscope. Images were analyzed using MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Control experiments were done without primary antibody. TIRF Microscopy Imaging—TIRF microscopy imaging was conducted using an Olympus IX81 motorized inverted microscope (Olympus). Excitation light was provided by a 20-milliwatt argon-krypton laser. The 488 nm laser was directed into an Olympus TIRF illuminator attached to the rear port of the microscope and through a 488 band pass filter (BP 10 nm) to a TIRF-optimized Olympus Plan APO ×60 (1.45 numerical aperture) oil immersion objective. Emitted light was collected through a 525 band pass filter (BP 50 nm). Images were collected every 0.5 s using a Hamamatsu EM C9100 back-thinned camera (Hamamatsu) controlled using the Openlab modular imaging software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Cells were bathed in a Ca2+-containing standard extracellular solution (ingredients as described above). Solution changes were accomplished by selecting flow from a multichambered valve-controlled mechanical fed reservoir. Effect of Knockdown of TRPC1, Orai1, or STIM1 on SOCE and Generation of ISOC—Knockdown of endogenous TRPC1, STIM1, or Orai1 using shTRPC1, STIM1 siRNA, or Orai1 siRNA reduced Tg-stimulated Ca2+ influx as compared with that in cells transfected with the relevant control vector or siRNA (Fig. 1, A-C, red and black traces, respectively). Internal Ca2+ release was not altered. (Note that shTRPC1 was used, because attempts to knock down TRPC1 with several different siRNAs, either commercially available or custom made, were not very successful even after 72 h of transfection). Consistent with the effect on Ca2+ influx, the store-operated current, ISOC, which we have previously described in HSG cells (6Liu X. Groschner K. Ambudkar I.S. J. Membr.

https://openalex.org/W2066513668,"Numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) have been discovered in the genomes of higher eukaryotes, and functional studies indicate that they are important during development. However, little is known concerning the function of individual miRNAs. We approached this problem in zebrafish by combining identification of miRNA expression, functional analyses and experimental validation of potential targets. We show that miR-214 is expressed during early segmentation stages in somites and that varying its expression alters the expression of genes regulated by Hedgehog signaling. Inhibition of miR-214 results in a reduction or loss of slow-muscle cell types. We show that su(fu) mRNA, encoding a negative regulator of Hedgehog signaling, is targeted by miR-214. Through regulation of su(fu), miR-214 enables precise specification of muscle cell types by sharpening cellular responses to Hedgehog."
https://openalex.org/W2160819536,"The roles of voltage-sensitive sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) channels located on dendrites and spines in regulating synaptic signals are largely unknown. Here we use 2-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines while monitoring uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (uEPSPs) and Ca transients. We find that, in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, CaV(2.3) voltage-sensitive Ca channels (VSCCs) are found selectively on spines and act locally to dampen uncaging-evoked Ca transients and somatic potentials. These effects are mediated by a regulatory loop that requires opening of CaV(2.3) channels, voltage-gated Na channels, small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels, and NMDA receptors. Ca influx through CaV(2.3) VSCCs selectively activates SK channels, revealing the presence of functional Ca microdomains within the spine. Our results suggest that synaptic strength can be modulated by mechanisms that regulate voltage-gated conductances within the spine but do not alter the properties or numbers of synaptic glutamate receptors."

This view is based on failures to find differences between various notational representations. Here we show that by using relatively smaller voxels together with an adaptation paradigm and analyzing subjects on an individual basis it is possible to detect specialized numerical representations. The current results reveal a left/right asymmetry in parietal lobe function. In contrast to an abstract representation in the left parietal lobe, the numerical representation in the right parietal lobe is notation dependent and thus includes nonabstract representations. Our results challenge the commonly held belief that numbers are represented solely in an abstract way in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W1982738871,"Background Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a lethal stroke type. As mortality approaches 50%, and current medical therapy against ICH shows only limited effectiveness, an alternative approach is required, such as stem cell-based cell therapy. Previously we have shown that intravenously transplanted human neural stem cells (NSCs) selectively migrate to the brain and induce behavioral recovery in rat ICH model, and that combined administration of NSCs and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) results in improved structural and functional outcome from cerebral ischemia. Methods and Findings We postulated that human NSCs overexpressing VEGF transplanted into cerebral cortex overlying ICH lesion could provide improved survival of grafted NSCs, increased angiogenesis and behavioral recovery in mouse ICH model. ICH was induced in adult mice by unilateral injection of bacterial collagenase into striatum. HB1.F3.VEGF human NSC line produced an amount of VEGF four times higher than parental F3 cell line in vitro, and induced behavioral improvement and 2–3 fold increase in cell survival at two weeks and eight weeks post-transplantation. Conclusions Brain transplantation of F3 human NSCs over-expressing VEGF near ICH lesion sites provided differentiation and survival of grafted human NSCs and renewed angiogenesis of host brain and functional recovery of ICH animals. These results suggest a possible application of the human neural stem cell line, which is genetically modified to over-express VEGF, as a therapeutic agent for ICH-stroke."

These experiments establish the feasibility of RNAi screens to characterize the mechanisms that control mammalian neuronal development and to identify components of the genetic program that regulate synapse formation and/or maintenance. Synapses are specialized sites of cell-cell contact that mediate the transmission and storage of information in the brain. The majority of synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) are chemical synapses, where communication occurs by the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal, which then acts on neurotransmitter receptors localized at the postsynaptic terminal (Li and Sheng, 2003Li Z. Sheng M. Some assembly required: the development of neuronal synapses.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Multiple, overlapping steps are required for the development of glutamatergic synapses in the mammalian hippocampus, beginning with initial contact between the axon and the dendrite (Ziv and Garner, 2004Ziv N.E. Garner C.C. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of presynaptic assembly.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After initial contact, preassembled packets of proteins localize to the presynaptic compartment to form the active zone and the synaptic vesicle release machinery (Ziv and Garner, 2004Ziv N.E. Garner C.C. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of presynaptic assembly.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, neurotransmitter receptors, signaling molecules, and scaffolding and structural proteins cluster at the postsynaptic site (Ziv and Garner, 2004Ziv N.E. Garner C.C. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of presynaptic assembly.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Finally, synapses undergo a process of refinement wherein a subset of synapses are weakened and eliminated while the remainder are strengthened and maintained (Katz and Shatz, 1996Katz L.C. Shatz C.J. Synaptic activity and the construction of cortical circuits.Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). Given the complex nature of synapse development, it is not surprising that multiple proteins are involved in regulating this process. Trans-synaptic ligand-receptor complexes and cell adhesion molecules are attractive candidates for regulating contact initiation and stabilization, as these proteins have both adhesive and intracellular signaling capabilities. Indeed, the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB and its ligand ephrinB, the neurexin/neuroligin complex, and SynCAM (Biederer et al., 2002Biederer T. Sara Y. Mozhayeva M. Atasoy D. Liu X. Kavalali E.T.

Moreover, the coordination of synapse development is a global cellular process that requires gene transcription in the nucleus (Flavell et al., 2006Flavell S.W. Cowan C.W. Kim T.K. Greer P.L. Lin Y.

Nelson S.B. Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Although intensive study has begun to identify molecules that regulate synapse development, it is still not known at which step in synapse development most of these molecules function. An identification of the full complement of molecules that are required for synapse development would represent a major advance toward understanding the requirement for individual molecules at specific steps in the process. In comparison to glutamatergic synapse development, less is known about the development of inhibitory, GABAergic synapses. The relatively low abundance of GABAergic synapses on hippocampal neurons has precluded the use of biochemistry to identify proteins present at such synapses (Fritschy and Brunig, 2003Fritschy J.M. Brunig I. Formation and plasticity of GABAergic synapses: physiological mechanisms and pathophysiological implications.Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 299-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Thus far, only a few proteins, such as gephyrin, a 93 kDa peripheral membrane protein, and dystrophin, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene product, have been shown to regulate GABAergic synapse development (Fritschy and Brunig, 2003Fritschy J.M. Brunig I. Formation and plasticity of GABAergic synapses: physiological mechanisms and pathophysiological implications.Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 299-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A remaining question in the field of synapse development is how a neuron matches the correct postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors to the appropriate glutamatergic or GABAergic presynaptic terminal. Interestingly, several proteins can regulate both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse development and/or function (Chih et al., 2005Chih B. Engelman H. Scheiffele P.

USA. 2005; 102: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and considerable mismatching of components of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses occurs both in vivo and in vitro (e.g., the localization of GABAA receptors to glutamatergic presynaptic terminals) (Anderson et al., 2004Anderson T.R.

Mismatched appositions of presynaptic and postsynaptic components in isolated hippocampal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8344-8353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the fidelity of matching increases as the neurons mature (Anderson et al., 2004Anderson T.R. Shah P.A. Benson D.L. Maturation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse composition in hippocampal neurons.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 694-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that neurons may execute a general program of synapse development that is sufficient to initiate the assembly of synaptic structures and that the final specification of the postsynaptic structure as either glutamatergic or GABAergic occurs at a later step in synapse development. These observations imply that proteins likely exist in the postsynaptic cell that regulate the sorting and/or matching of the proper neurotransmitter receptors with their appropriate presynaptic terminals. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that control synapse development, we developed a strategy for discovering molecules required for the various steps in glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse development. Specifically, we established an RNA interference (RNAi)-based, forward genetic screen to identify molecules that regulate synapse development. Thus far, we have identified five genes that play a role in glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synapse development. These include: two cadherin family members, cadherin-11 and cadherin-13; two class 4 Semaphorins, Sema4B and Sema4D; and the activity-regulated small GTPase Rem2. We took a two-step approach to identify molecules that are important for the development of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampal neurons. First, we used transcriptional profiling to identify transcripts that are up- or downregulated during the time period of synapse development in the postnatal rodent hippocampus. We also identified genes regulated by activity in cultured neurons, as neuronal activity has been shown to be required for synapse stabilization and maintenance (Katz and Shatz, 1996Katz L.C. Shatz C.J. Synaptic activity and the construction of cortical circuits.Science. 1996; 274: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). From an analysis of the regulation of over 30,000 genes, we compiled a list of approximately 600 genes that we considered good candidates for regulating synapse development. From this list, we prioritized the genes to be targeted in the RNAi screen by choosing those that were highly induced by activity or those with relevant functional motifs such as cadherin repeats or Ig or RING finger domains (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data). We also supplemented our list with genes that we hypothesized might be involved in synapse development based on work in other organisms or on the genes' roles in related biological processes. Next, to determine whether these candidate genes play a role in synapse development, we established an RNAi-based screen in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure 1). RNAi is an innate mechanism in eukaryotes in which double-stranded 21- to 23-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) target the corresponding mRNA for degradation in a sequence-specific manner (Novina and Sharp, 2004Novina C.D. Sharp P.A. The RNAi revolution.Nature. 2004; 430: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We used the RNase III-family member enzyme Dicer to construct a library of siRNAs targeting the candidate gene products. The mixture of siRNAs produced by Dicer digestion has been shown to effectively target specific genes (Myers et al., 2003Myers J.W. Jones J.T. Meyer T. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Recombinant Dicer efficiently converts large dsRNAs into siRNAs suitable for gene silencing.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data), and in pilot experiments, we demonstrated efficient and specific knockdown of over 15 gene products in heterologous cells using diced siRNAs (Figure S2 and A.E. West, A. Brunet, S.P. and M.E.G., unpublished data). Before commencing the screen, diced siRNAs were evaluated for their ability to knock down neuronally expressed proteins over the time period of synapse development in hippocampal culture. As synapse development in culture occurs over a period of approximately 2 weeks (Rao et al., 1998Rao A. Kim E. Sheng M. Craig A.M. Heterogeneity in the molecular composition of excitatory postsynaptic sites during development of hippocampal neurons in culture.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the time frame of gene knockdown that is required in a screen for genes important for synapse development is significantly longer than that required for previously reported screens. We transfected hippocampal neurons with diced siRNAs targeting the PSD-95 or GluR2 mRNA at 4DIV and assessed protein knockdown by quantitative immunocytochemistry at 14DIV. Diced siRNAs targeting the PSD-95 or GluR2 mRNA significantly reduced the expression of the targeted gene (Figure S1). In addition, we sought to increase the throughput of the screen by transfecting pools of diced siRNAs that target multiple genes into neurons. We found that transfecting pools of siRNAs that target more than one gene results in knockdown comparable to that observed with transfection of siRNAs targeting each gene individually (Figure S3), and thus, the majority of the screen was performed using pools of diced siRNAs targeting multiple genes. The assay that we established to assess the effect of knockdown of the targeted genes on the density of glutamatergic synapses is as follows. We cotransfected neurons with GFP and diced siRNAs at 4DIV, then fixed and stained the transfected cells at 14DIV with antibodies that recognize synapsin I, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein, and PSD-95, a scaffolding protein that is highly enriched at the postsynaptic side of glutamatergic synapses. Images of transfected neurons were acquired by confocal microscopy, and synapse density was quantified as the number of opposing synapsin I/PSD-95 puncta present along the dendrites of GFP-expressing neurons (see Experimental Procedures). Thus, since we scored the number of synapses formed onto the transfected neuron rather than the number of synapses formed by the transfected neuron, we assayed the function of the targeted genes in the postsynaptic neuron. Our screen was controlled for nonspecific or “off-target” effects of the RNAi methodology. For one, the low hit rate of the screen (16% of pools were initially “positive,” 4% were reproducibly positive) speaks to the overall immutability of glutamatergic synapse density after transfection with siRNAs (Figure 2A). Moreover, we compared neurons transfected with GFP with neurons transfected with GFP and siRNAs targeting DsRed and found that synapse density did not differ between the two conditions (data not shown). We also used Sholl analysis to assess the complexity of the dendritic arbors in the diced siRNA-treated cells and found no change as a result of treating neurons with diced siRNAs targeting DsRed or the genes comprising the positive pools (Figure S4). This suggests that transfection with siRNAs did not a priori cause a deficit in cell health or dendritic complexity and that the reductions in glutamatergic synapse density observed for our positive pools are likely not a result of a perturbation of cell health or dendritic complexity. Thus far, we have analyzed 160 genes comprising 105 unique pools of diced siRNAs targeting 1–4 genes (Figure 2A and Table S1). A pool was considered positive if the pool of diced siRNAs caused a change in the density of glutamatergic synapses as compared with control (significance determined by two-sample t test using a cutoff of p < 0.05; black diamonds in Figure 2A). All positive pools were retested and analyzed further if the pool was positive in the second experiment (red circles in Figure 2A). Of the 105 pools analyzed to date, 4 pools of diced siRNAs yielded a reproducible change in synapse density: Lin7c/Rem2, cadherin-11/cadherin-13, APC5/Ube2d3, and Sema4A/Sema4B/Sema4D (Figures 2B and 2C). We further characterized the hits in our screen by transfecting neurons with short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting each of the genes from the positive pools. We thus sought to determine which gene(s) was responsible for the observed decrease in synapse density. We designed three shRNAs against each of the genes in the positive pools using current algorithms for the rational design of shRNAs (see Experimental Procedures). Each shRNA matches a single 21 base pair (bp) sequence within the targeted gene. This is in contrast to the diced siRNAs where multiple 21 bp siRNAs target the gene of interest. To insure maximum efficiency of knockdown by shRNAs, we simultaneously transfected three shRNAs targeting a specific gene into neurons and assessed synapse density. We also confirmed the specificity of the diced siRNAs and the shRNAs for knockdown of individual gene products in heterologous cells (Figure S2). By targeting each gene product from our positive pools using shRNAs, we found that knockdown of the Rem2, cadherin-11, cadherin-13, or Sema4B gene product causes a decrease in the density of glutamatergic synapses. The transfection of shRNAs targeting APC5 or Sema4D has no effect on glutamatergic synapse density (Figures 3A and 3B), and shRNA constructs targeting the Sema4A and Ube2d3 gene products cause cell lethality. Our screen identified regulators of synapse development from multiple categories on our original list of candidate genes, including activity-regulated genes, cell adhesion molecules, and putative pathfinding molecules, which underscores the complex nature of synapse development. We have investigated the importance of these genes for glutamatergic synapse development as follows: (1) analysis of the specificity of the RNAi phenotype (Figures 3C, 3D, 6C, and 6D), (2) assessment of glutamatergic synapse development by whole-cell voltage-clamp recording of AMPA receptor-mediated mEPSCs (Figure 4) and immunostaining with antibodies recognizing the GluR2 subunit of the AMPAR (Figure 5), and (3) assessment of the development of pre- and postsynaptic specializations independent of a requirement for colocalization (Figures 3E and 3F). In addition, we sought to determine if the genes identified in the screen are general regulators of synapse development by testing whether they are also involved in GABAergic synapse development (Figure 6).Figure 5Rem2, Cadherin-11, Cadherin-13, and Sema4B Are Required for the Development of AMPA Receptor-Containing SynapsesShow full caption(A) Immunostaining for GluR2 (red) and Synaptotagmin I (blue) in the dendrites of cells cotransfected with GFP and shRNAs targeting the indicated gene products.

Our screen revealed a role for the cadherin-13 and cadherin-11 gene products as positive regulators of glutamatergic synapse development. The large size of the cadherin family, the restricted expression of cadherin family members, and the localization of cadherin family members to synapses has suggested a role for the cadherin family in determining synapse specificity (Fannon and Colman, 1996Fannon A.M. Colman D.R. A model for central synaptic junctional complex formation based on the differential adhesive specificities of the cadherins.Neuron. 1996; 17: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). It is not known which cadherin family members are important for the development of connections between specific subpopulations of neurons. However, cadherin-11 is known to be expressed in the hippocampus during the postnatal period when robust synaptogenesis occurs (Manabe et al., 2000Manabe T. Togashi H. Uchida N. Suzuki S.C. Hayakawa Y. Yamamoto M. Yoda H. Miyakawa T. Takeichi M. Chisaka O. Loss of cadherin-11 adhesion receptor enhances plastic changes in hippocampal synapses and modifies behavioral responses.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 534-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and the expression of cadherin-13 is upregulated between 2 and 7 days in culture, a time when synapse development is beginning (data not shown). We further characterized the role of cadherin-13 in synapse development and compared the function of cadherin-13 to that of cadherin-11. We began by verifying the specificity of the cadherin-13 RNAi phenotype (Figures 3C and 3D). We demonstrated that transfection of a single shRNA construct targeting cadherin-13, shRNA_2_Cdh13 (Figure 3C), produces a decrease in synapse density comparable to that observed in neurons transfected with pools of diced siRNAs (Figure 2C) or with three shRNA constructs (Figure 3B). These various cadherin-13 RNAi technologies target distinct regions of the cadherin-13 mRNA, and each causes a decrease in glutamatergic synapse density. This suggests that the observed decreases in synapse density are due to knockdown of the cadherin-13 mRNA and not to an off-target effect of the RNAi. We created a cadherin-13 expression plasmid resistant to knockdown by shRNA_2_Cdh13 (Figure S2B) and tested its ability t"
https://openalex.org/W2083485324,"Ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) are conjugated by dynamic E1–E2–E3 enzyme cascades. E1 enzymes activate UBLs by catalysing UBL carboxy-terminal adenylation, forming a covalent E1˜UBL thioester intermediate, and generating a thioester-linked E2˜UBL product, which must be released for subsequent reactions. Here we report the structural analysis of a trapped UBL activation complex for the human NEDD8 pathway, containing NEDD8’s heterodimeric E1 (APPBP1–UBA3), two NEDD8s (one thioester-linked to E1, one noncovalently associated for adenylation), a catalytically inactive E2 (Ubc12), and MgATP. The results suggest that a thioester switch toggles E1–E2 affinities. Two E2 binding sites depend on NEDD8 being thioester-linked to E1. One is unmasked by a striking E1 conformational change. The other comes directly from the thioester-bound NEDD8. After NEDD8 transfer to E2, reversion to an alternate E1 conformation would facilitate release of the E2˜NEDD8 thioester product. Thus, transferring the UBL’s thioester linkage between successive conjugation enzymes can induce conformational changes and alter interaction networks to drive consecutive steps in UBL cascades. The structure of the enzyme E1 bound to its four substrates is described, showing how a thioester switch toggles E1-E2 affinities. Transferring the Ubl's thioester linkage between successive conjugation enzymes induces striking conformational changes and alters interaction networks to drive consecutive steps in Ubl cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1980316562,"GABA(B) receptors are heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors composed of R1 and R2 subunits that mediate slow synaptic inhibition in the brain by activating inwardly rectifying K(+) channels (GIRKs) and inhibiting Ca(2+) channels. We demonstrate here that GABA(B) receptors are intimately associated with 5'AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as a metabolic sensor that is potently activated by increases in 5'AMP concentration that are caused by enhanced metabolic activity, anoxia, or ischemia. AMPK binds the R1 subunit and directly phosphorylates S783 in the R2 subunit to enhance GABA(B) receptor activation of GIRKs. Phosphorylation of S783 is evident in many brain regions, and is increased dramatically after ischemic injury. Finally, we also reveal that S783 plays a critical role in enhancing neuronal survival after ischemia. Together our results provide evidence of a neuroprotective mechanism, which, under conditions of metabolic stress or after ischemia, increases GABA(B) receptor function to reduce excitotoxicity and thereby promotes neuronal survival."
https://openalex.org/W2021981560,"To understand the functions of NIPA1, mutated in the neurodegenerative disease hereditary spastic paraplegia, and of ichthyin, mutated in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, we have studied their Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, spichthyin (Spict). Spict is found on early endosomes. Loss of Spict leads to upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and expansion of the neuromuscular junction. BMP signaling is also necessary for a normal microtubule cytoskeleton and axonal transport; analysis of loss- and gain-of-function phenotypes indicate that Spict may antagonize this function of BMP signaling. Spict interacts with BMP receptors and promotes their internalization from the plasma membrane, implying that it inhibits BMP signaling by regulating BMP receptor traffic. This is the first demonstration of a role for a hereditary spastic paraplegia protein or ichthyin family member in a specific signaling pathway, and implies disease mechanisms for hereditary spastic paraplegia that involve dependence of the microtubule cytoskeleton on BMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2056781179,"Frequency tuning in the cochlea is determined by the passive mechanical properties of the basilar membrane and active feedback from the outer hair cells, sensory-effector cells that detect and amplify sound-induced basilar membrane motions. The sensory hair bundles of the outer hair cells are imbedded in the tectorial membrane, a sheet of extracellular matrix that overlies the cochlea's sensory epithelium. The tectorial membrane contains radially organized collagen fibrils that are imbedded in an unusual striated-sheet matrix formed by two glycoproteins, alpha-tectorin (Tecta) and beta-tectorin (Tectb). In Tectb(-/-) mice the structure of the striated-sheet matrix is disrupted. Although these mice have a low-frequency hearing loss, basilar-membrane and neural tuning are both significantly enhanced in the high-frequency regions of the cochlea, with little loss in sensitivity. These findings can be attributed to a reduction in the acting mass of the tectorial membrane and reveal a new function for this structure in controlling interactions along the cochlea."
https://openalex.org/W2136178930,"Axon-axon interactions have been implicated in neural circuit assembly, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that in the Drosophila antennal lobe, early-arriving axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) from the antenna are required for the proper targeting of late-arriving ORN axons from the maxillary palp (MP). Semaphorin-1a is required for targeting of all MP but only half of the antennal ORN classes examined. Sema-1a acts nonautonomously to control ORN axon-axon interactions, in contrast to its cell-autonomous function in olfactory projection neurons. Phenotypic and genetic interaction analyses implicate PlexinA as the Sema-1a receptor in ORN targeting. Sema-1a on antennal ORN axons is required for correct targeting of MP axons within the antennal lobe, while interactions amongst MP axons facilitate their entry into the antennal lobe. We propose that Sema-1a/PlexinA-mediated repulsion provides a mechanism by which early-arriving ORN axons constrain the target choices of late-arriving axons."

https://openalex.org/W2004921139,"Targeting of synaptic molecules to their proper location is essential for synaptic differentiation and plasticity. PSD-95/Dlg proteins have been established as key components of the postsynapse. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the synaptic targeting, assembly, and disassembly of PSD-95/Dlg are not well understood. Here we show that PAR-1 kinase, a conserved cell polarity regulator, is critically involved in controlling the postsynaptic localization of Dlg. PAR-1 is prominently localized at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Loss of PAR-1 function leads to increased synapse formation and synaptic transmission, whereas overexpression of PAR-1 has the opposite effects. PAR-1 directly phosphorylates Dlg at a conserved site and negatively regulates its mobility and targeting to the postsynapse. The ability of a nonphosphorylatable Dlg to largely rescue PAR-1-induced synaptic defects supports the idea that Dlg is a major synaptic substrate of PAR-1. Control of Dlg synaptic targeting by PAR-1-mediated phosphorylation thus constitutes a critical event in synaptogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2048599247,"The ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) promotes the proteasomal degradation of target proteins by decorating them with Ub labels. Emerging evidence indicates a role of UPS in regulating gene transcription. In this study, we provided evidence for the involvement of UPS in the transcriptional activation function of tumor suppressor p53. We showed that both ubiquitylation and proteasomal functions are required for efficient transcription mediated by p53. Disruption of transcription by actinomycin D, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimadazole or alpha-amanitin leads to accumulation of cellular p53 protein. Proteasome inhibition by MG132 increases the occupancy of p53 protein at p53-responsive p21(waf1) promoter. In addition, the Sug-1 component of 19S proteasome physically interacts with p53 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in response to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage, both the 19S proteasomal components, Sug1 and S1, are recruited to p21(waf1) promoter region in a kinetic pattern similar to that of p53. These results suggested that UPS positively regulates p53-mediated transcription at p21(waf1) promoter."

However, differences in the requirements of E6/E6AP and Mdm2 to promote the degradation of p53, both in vivo and in vitro, suggest that these two E3 ligases may promote p53 degradation by distinct pathways. Using tools that disrupt ubiquitination and degradation, clear differences between E6- and Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation are presented. The consistent failure to fully protect p53 protein from E6-mediated degradation by disrupting the ubiquitin-degradation pathway provides the first evidence of an E6-dependent, ubiquitin-independent, p53 degradation pathway in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1972938448,"Activator protein-2 (AP-2) is a transcription factor that regulates proliferation and differentiation in mammalian cells and has been implicated in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in several types of cancer. Herein, we examine the role of AP-2α in colon cancer progression. We provide evidence for the lack of AP-2α expression in the late stages of colon cancer cells. Re-expression of the AP-2α gene in the AP-2α-negative SW480 colon cancer cells suppressed their tumorigenicity following orthotopic injection into the cecal wall of nude mice. The inhibition of tumor growth could be attributed to the increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression and activity of matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in the transfected cells, as well as a substantial loss of their in vitro invasive properties. Conversely, targeting constitutive expression of AP-2α in AP-2-positive KM12C colon cancer cells with small interfering RNA resulted in an increase in their invasive potential, downregulation of E-cadherin and increased expression of MMP-9. In SW480 cells, re-expression of AP-2α resulted in a fourfold increase in the activity of E-cadherin promoter, and a 5–14-fold decrease in the activity of MMP-9 promoter, indicating transcriptional regulation of these genes by AP-2α. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that re-expressed AP-2α directly binds to the promoter of E-cadherin, where it has been previously reported to act as a transcriptional activator. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed AP-2α binding to the MMP-9 promoter, which ensued by decreased binding of transcription factor Sp-1 and changes in the recruitment of transcription factors to a distal AP-1 element, thus, contributing to the overall downregulation of MMP-9 promoter activity. Collectively, our data provide evidence that AP-2α acts as a tumor suppressor gene in colon cancer."

Most data concerning LINE-1 biology and evolution are derived from the human and mouse genomes and are often assumed to hold for all placentals.To examine LINE-1 relationships, sequences from the 3' region of the reverse transcriptase from 21 species (representing 13 orders across Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Supraprimates and Laurasiatheria) were obtained from whole genome sequence assemblies, or by PCR with degenerate primers. These sequences were aligned and analysed.Our analysis reflects accepted placental relationships suggesting mostly lineage-specific LINE-1 families. The data provide clear support for several clades including Glires, Supraprimates, Laurasiatheria, Boreoeutheria, Xenarthra and Afrotheria.

https://openalex.org/W2076687077,"In a previous study, we have described that UVB induces granzyme B (GrB) in human keratinocyte cells, and that confers potent cellular cytotoxicity against various cellular models, including immune cells (Hernandez-Pigeon, H., Jean, C., Charruyer, A., Haure, M. J., Titeux, M., Tonasso, L., Quillet-Mary, A., Baudouin, C., Charveron, M., and Laurent, G. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 13525–13532). Herein, we have found that, in contrast to UVB, UVA failed to enhance keratinocyte cellular cytotoxicity but was still able to trigger GrB production. We show that GrB is accumulated through a p38 MAPK-dependent transcriptional mechanism stimulated by redox-dependent migration inhibitory factor release. Moreover, GrB purified from UVA-treated cellular extracts was found to degrade fibronectin in vitro. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide directed against GrB resulted in the inhibition of UVA-induced cell detachment and cell death and facilitated cell migration through fibronectin and vitronectin matrix upon UVA exposure. Altogether, these results suggest another function for GrB in the context of the UV response. Indeed, combined with our previous study, it appears that, whereas this enzyme mediates keratinocyte cellular cytotoxicity following UVB irradiation, GrB supports the capacity of keratinocyte to degrade extracellular matrix components following UVA irradiation. UV-mediated GrB production may thus have important consequences in photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. In a previous study, we have described that UVB induces granzyme B (GrB) in human keratinocyte cells, and that confers potent cellular cytotoxicity against various cellular models, including immune cells (Hernandez-Pigeon, H., Jean, C., Charruyer, A., Haure, M.

Herein, we have found that, in contrast to UVB, UVA failed to enhance keratinocyte cellular cytotoxicity but was still able to trigger GrB production. We show that GrB is accumulated through a p38 MAPK-dependent transcriptional mechanism stimulated by redox-dependent migration inhibitory factor release. Moreover, GrB purified from UVA-treated cellular extracts was found to degrade fibronectin in vitro. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide directed against GrB resulted in the inhibition of UVA-induced cell detachment and cell death and facilitated cell migration through fibronectin and vitronectin matrix upon UVA exposure. Altogether, these results suggest another function for GrB in the context of the UV response. Indeed, combined with our previous study, it appears that, whereas this enzyme mediates keratinocyte cellular cytotoxicity following UVB irradiation, GrB supports the capacity of keratinocyte to degrade extracellular matrix components following UVA irradiation. UV-mediated GrB production may thus have important consequences in photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. UVA is a major contributor to a vast variety of skin lesions following prolonged exposure to solar radiation culminating in photoaging or photocarcinogenesis. In this context, extracellular matrix degradation is an important event responsible for wrinkle formation, reduced recoil capacity, and blister formation, all hallmarks of photoaging. UVA-induced matrix degradation is generally considered as the result of the production of various matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 4The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; Ab, antibody; GrB, granzyme B; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitor factor; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rGrB, recombinant granzyme B; rMIF, recombinant MIF; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKAPK, MAPK-activated protein kinase; ROS, radical oxygen species; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. 4The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; Ab, antibody; GrB, granzyme B; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitor factor; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rGrB, recombinant granzyme B; rMIF, recombinant MIF; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKAPK, MAPK-activated protein kinase; ROS, radical oxygen species; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein. not only by dermal fibroblasts but also by keratinocytes. MMP display substrate specificity for dermal (collagens I, III, and V, proteoglycans, and elastin) and basement membrane compounds (collagens IV and VII, proteoglycans, laminin, and fibronectin). The effects of MMP are counteracted by tissue inhibitor of MMP1. The fact that UV also triggers extracellular matrix component biosynthesis renders even more complex this balance. For example, as evidenced in the hairless mouse model, fibronectin accumulates upon prolonged UV exposure (1Schwartz E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1988; 91: 158-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the increase of this important extracellular matrix component reflects the net balance between stimulated biosynthesis (2Boyer B. Fourtanier A. Kern P. Labat-Robert J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1992; 14: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and an enhanced degradation through specific MMP, such as MMP2 and MMP9, but not MMP1 (3McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 4Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Granzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease contained in cytotoxic granules inside activated immune cells. Upon release from these cells, GrB induces target cell lysis in combination with perforin, another protein component of the cytotoxic granules. Although the role of GrB in non-lymphoid cells has received little attention, one previous study has described that significant amount of catalytically active GrB accumulated into keratinocytes when these cells were plated at high density, suggesting that, at least in some stress conditions, keratinocytes may produce this enzyme (5Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, we have recently shown that UVB induces GrB expression in keratinocytes, and this confers to the cells potent cellular cytotoxicity against a wide variety of cellular models, including immune cells (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is surprising that this observation has attracted no further attention in the field of photoaging. Indeed, previous studies dealing with the role of GrB in the destruction of cartilage in the context of rheumatoid arthritis have already described that GrB degrades glycosaminoglycans (7Ronday H.K. van der Laan W.H. Tak P.P. de Roos J.A. Bank R.A. TeKoppele J.M. Froelich C.J. Hack C.E. Hogendoorn P.C. Breedveld F.C. Verheijen J.H.

Immunol. 1993; 151: 7161-7171PubMed Google Scholar), which is distributed in the skin. More recently, GrB has been identified as a central player for extracellular matrix remodeling based on its potent proteolytic capacity for vitronectin, laminin, and fibronectin (9Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol.

Podor T.J. McManus B.M. Granville D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on these findings and considerations, we speculated that UVA irradiation could trigger GrB production in skin cells, and that this event contributes to the degradation of fibronectin in combination with MMP. Moreover, based on a previous study that showed that MMP production upon UVA stimulation is mediated by the release of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (11Watanabe H. Shimizu T. Nishihira J. Abe R. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Sabe H. Ishibashi T. Shimizu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether MIF could be involved in UVA-mediated GrB production. This study shows that, indeed, UVA irradiation induces the production of catalytically active GrB through MIF, UVA-induced GrB was able to degrade fibronectin, and consequently GrB influences cell detachment, cell death, and cell migration. Cell Culture and Chemicals—Immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes, provided by CERPER (Pierre-Fabre, France), were cultured in DMEM at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Culture medium was supplemented with 10% FCS, glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (200 units/ml) (all these reagents were purchased from Eurobio, les Ulis, France). Normal human skin was obtained immediately after surgery for breast reduction. The UVA irradiation source was a fluorescent lamp (Uvitec, Cambridge) that emitted an energy peak at 340 nm. The emitted dose was calculated using a UVA radiometer photodetector (Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-vallé;e, France). UVA irradiation was performed in cells incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C. Drugs and Reagents—The rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab) against fibronectin (used at 1/1000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The rabbit polyclonal anti-MAPKAPK-2 and antiphospho MAPKAPK-2 Thr-222 Abs (used at 1/1000) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (St. Quentin en Yvelines, France). The mouse monoclonal anti-GrB (clone GrB-7, used at 1/200) and anti-β-actin (used at 1/1000) Abs were purchased, respectively, from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France) and NeoMarkers (Interchim, Montluçon, France). Affinity-purified secondary Abs were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (Beckman Coulter Company, Marseille, France). SB203580, SP600125, and PD98059 were purchased from VWR International (Fontenay sous Bois, France). Recombinant human MIF (rMIF) and human MIF Ab were obtained from R&D Systems (Lille, France). Controls and antisense oligonucleotides directed against GrB have been designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Euromedex, Mundolsheim, France) (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J.

Human recombinant GrB protein was purchased from Coger (Paris, France). Other products were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as already described (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M.

Briefly, cells were permeabilized using 100% methanol (2 min at room temperature) and incubated with anti-GrB Ab at a 1/20 dilution in 1% FCS-PBS, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Beckman-Coulters) diluted at 1/100 in 1% FCS-PBS for 25 min at room temperature. Immunohistochemistry—Several 4-mm punch biopsies were taken from normal human skin. Irradiated samples and non-irradiated samples were placed in PBS. Irradiated skin samples received 150 kJ/m2 UVA delivered by a blue lamp bulb UVA lamp in the BioSun System (Vilber Lourmat). After irradiation, skin biopsies were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2 during 24 h. All the biopsies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen in tissue embedding (Tissue-Tek®, Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and 5-μm-thick sections were prepared in cryostat, air dried, and fixed in acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. Sections were first rehydrated in PBS, and endogenous peroxidases were inactivated. Tissue sections were incubated for 15 min with Protein Block (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA), and then for 1 h with 1/100 GrB primary antibody (goat anti-GrB, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Negative control was obtained without GrB primary antibody. Sections were rinsed in PBS and revealed with DAKO LSAB+ kit peroxidase and diaminobenzidine (DakoCytomation) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were observed using light microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Human MIF Immunoassay—For the quantitative determination of MIF concentrations in cell culture supernatants, we used the human MIF immunoassay kit (Quantikine, R&D Systems). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assessment of Fibronectin Cleavage by GrB—HaCaT cells were irradiated or not at 100 kJ/m2, and GrB was immunoprecipitated as previously described (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For assessment of cleavage of fibronectin, wells of a 24-well tray were coated with 500 ng of fibronectin, blocked with bovine serum albumin, and incubated with GrB immunoprecipitated or with human recombinant GrB protein (20 ng). After 24 h of incubation, Laemmli sample buffer was added, complexes were scrapped, and cleavage of fibronectin was visualized by Western blot analysis using anti-fibronectin Ab. Cell Death Assays—HaCaT cells were plated onto 96-well tissue culture tray coated with 2 μg of fibronectin (8 × 104/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were pretreated with sense or antisense GrB oligonucleotides for 6 h at 37 °C prior to exposing cells at 100 or 150 kJ/m2 UVA. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in DMEM 0.2% FCS to inhibit cell proliferation. For quantification of the remaining survival cells, cells were incubated with 100 μl of 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) for 1 h. Deposited formazan crystals were solubilized by addition of 100 μl of Me2SO (DMSO) and detected at Abs 595 nm. Cell Migration and Invasion Assays—For invasion assays, 105 HaCaT cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% FCS into Falcon™ HTS Fluoroblok™ 24-Multiwell Insert System (6.5-mm diameter, 3-μm pore size, BD Biosciences) that had been precoated with 2 μg of fibronectin. Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h and were washed, pre-treated or not with GrB antisense or sense oligonucleotides (5 μm) for 6 h, irradiated at 100 or 150 kJ/m2 UVA, marked with 5 μm CellTracker Green CMFDA (5-Chloromethyl fluorescein diacetate) (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the medium was replaced with 300 μl of DMEM containing 0.2% FCS to inhibit cell proliferation. Cells were allowed to migrate toward 10% FCS for 24 h, after which cells on the underside of the membrane were detected by fluorescence of CMFDA (Abs 490 nm/Em 520 nm). Induction of GrB Expression by UVA in HaCaT Cells— HaCaT cells were treated with UVA at different doses and incubated for 16 h (Fig. 1A) or were irradiated at 100 kJ/m2 and were incubated for different times (Fig. 1B). GrB mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR followed by a separation of PCR products in 2% agarose gel. In non-irradiated non-confluent HaCaT cells, GrB mRNA was undetectable as previously described (5Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), whereas UVA irradiation induced time and dose-dependent increase in GrB mRNA with a maximum of 100 kJ/m2 above which we detected toxicity (Fig. 1, A and B). In HaCaT cells grown at confluence, GrB mRNA were detectable as previously described (5Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In these conditions of culture, UVA irradiation was still able to induce a 3-fold increase in GrB gene expression (data not shown). Immunoblot revealed GrB protein in HaCaT cells following UVA stimulation (Fig. 1C) and confocal microscopy showed that GrB accumulated into cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, treatment with UVA results in an increase in mRNA of MMP1 in HaCaT cells as previously described in dermal fibroblasts (11Watanabe H. Shimizu T. Nishihira J. Abe R. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Sabe H. Ishibashi T. Shimizu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas mRNA levels of MMP2 and MMP9 were unchanged (Fig. 1E). This response profile was different from that we observed in human dermal fibroblasts, which displayed increased expression of each of these MMP, whereas GrB was unchanged (data not shown). Induction of GrB Expression by UVA in Human Skin—Normal human skin from different donors was irradiated at 150 kJ/m2 UVA. This dose was used due to the thickness of the skin. In these conditions, as shown by immunohistochemistry for a representative donor, UVA also stimulated GrB protein expression (Fig. 2). As also illustrated in Fig. 2, GrB accumulated into the epidermal compartment and remained undetectable in dermis. This result was in agreement with the lack of GrB induction in primary fibroblast cultures. Altogether, these results suggest that UVA irradiation activates GrB at the mRNA level in human keratinocytes. Role of MIF in the Induction of GrB by UVA Irradiation— Based on a previous study, which showed that not only did treatment with UVA result in the release of MIF from dermal fibroblasts but also that MIF played a central role in the production of MMP1 by these cells (11Watanabe H. Shimizu T. Nishihira J. Abe R. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Sabe H. Ishibashi T. Shimizu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we investigated whether similar mechanism could operate in keratinocytes cells. We found that UVA induced a time-dependent release of MIF in HaCaT culture medium as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a maximum for 100 kJ/m2 at 24 h (Fig. 3A). The kinetics and magnitude of MIF production in keratinocytes were similar to those we observed in primary fibroblasts (data not shown). We were unable to detect MIF gene activation or modification in cellular MIF protein content (data not shown) suggesting that, in keratinocytes, UVA acts on MIF transport rather than on gene or protein regulation. The role of MIF in GrB induction was then evaluated. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment with human rMIF resulted in GrB mRNA expression in HaCaT cells, thus mimicking the effect of UVA, whereas pre-treatment of HaCaT cells with antibody directed against MIF, completely inhibited GrB induction by UVA irradiation (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrated that MIF plays a critical role in GrB gene activation by UVA. In the abovementioned study (11Watanabe H. Shimizu T. Nishihira J. Abe R. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Sabe H. Ishibashi T. Shimizu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the authors have not investigated the signaling events that control MIF production. Based on the important role of radical oxygen species (ROS) in the UVA response, we hypothesized that ROS could play a role in the release of MIF and, subsequently, in GrB induction. As a matter of fact, pre-treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent anti-oxidant agent, prevented the release of MIF (Fig. 3C), whereas treatment with H2O2 resulted in MIF secretion, thus mimicking the effect of UVA (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that ROS plays a central role in UVA-induced MIF release from keratinocytes. Because, on one hand, ROS regulated MIF, and, on the other hand, MIF is essential for GrB induction, one could easily speculate that ROS are also essential for UVA-mediated GrB regulation. Indeed, treatment with H2O2 resulted in GrB gene activation (Fig. 3E), whereas NAC inhibited UVA-induced GrB activation, both at the mRNA (Fig. 3F) and at the protein level (Fig. 3G). Altogether, our study argues for a model in which UVA-induced ROS production mediates the release of MIF, which, in turn, induces GrB gene activation and protein accumulation. Role of p38 MAPK in MIF- and UVA-induced GrB Activation—In further studies, we investigated the mechanism that links UVA-induced MIF production and UVA-induced GrB activation. We hypothesized that MAPK could play a role in coupling MIF with GrB gene regulation based on three lines of evidences. First, MIF and UVA were found to activate ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK modules (13Santos L.L. Lacey D. Yang Y. Leech M. Morand E.F. J. Rheumatol. 2004; 31: 1038-1043PubMed Google Scholar, 14Silvers A.L. Bachelor M.A. Bowden G.T. Neoplasia. 2003; 5: 319-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, MAPK are candidates for the regulation of AP1 and CREB, two regulatory elements of GrB promoter (15Babichuk C.K. Duggan B.L. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16485-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Wargnier A. Legros-Maida S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael C.J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Third, we have already demonstrated that UVB induced GrB expression via MAPK pathway in keratinocytes (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, we found that UVA as well MIF stimulates ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK (data not shown). Then, HaCaT cells were pre-treated with MAPK inhibitors and then ultimately treated with rMIF. Only SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor, totally inhibited GrB mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein induction (Fig. 4B) by UVA, whereas both JNK and ERK inhibitors had no effect either on GrB mRNA (Fig. 4A) or on protein induction (data not shown). As a control, we show in Fig. 4C that rMIF did activate p38 MAPK as attested by SB203580-inhibitable phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2, a substrate of p38 MAPK. To confirm the implication of p38 MAPK in UVA-induced GrB activation, we performed similar experiments in HaCaT cells irradiated with UVA. As expected from the above results, we found that UVA triggered p38 MAPK, and that this stimulation was essential for GrB gene activation (Fig. 5A) and protein accumulation (Fig. 5B). As a control, we show in Fig. 5C that UVA, like MIF, activated p38 MAPK as attested by SB203580-inhibitable phosphorylation of MAPKAPK2. Altogether, these results suggest a model in which UVA induces the production of MIF which, in turn, activates GrB through p38 MAPK. Effect of GrB on Fibronectin Cleavage following UVA Irradiation—GrB has been shown to cleave extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin (9Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Choy J.C. Hung V.H. Hunter A.L. Cheung P.K. Motyka B. Goping I.S. Sawchuk T. Bleackley R.C. Podor T.J. McManus B.M. Granville D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To confirm that GrB induced by UVA irradiation is able to degrade this extracellular matrix protein, we irradiated HaCaT cells at 100 kJ/m2, and 24 h after irradiation, GrB protein was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. In irradiated cells, GrB was totally retained in immunoprecipitates, because it was undetectable in the supernatants (Fig. 6A). These immunoextracts were then incubated for 24 h with 500 ng of plated purified fibronectin. As illustrated in Fig. 6B, we observed that anti-GrB immunoextracts from UVA-irradiated cells, but not from control cells, were able to degrade purified fibronectin. Control experiments showed that human recombinant GrB induced a dose-dependent cleavage of fibronectin as illustrated in Fig. 6B for the concentration of 20 ng. These results show that, after UVA irradiation, GrB is able to degrade fibronectin protein. Effect of GrB on Keratinocyte Cell Death and Migration following UVA Irradiation—Buzza and co-workers (9Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) described that recombinant GrB-mediated degradation of extracellular matrix structure resulted in cell detachment and cell death as well as in cell migration inhibition. Therefore, we have investigated whether UVA-induced GrB display similar properties in fibronectin-plated keratinocytes. To test this hypothesis, we used antisense oligonucleotide strategy to deplete UVA-induced GrB protein expression. Indeed, confocal analysis showed that antisense oligonucleotide directed against GrB, but not sense, inhibit UVA-induced GrB expression (Fig. 7A). As illustrated in Fig. 7B, UVA (100 and 150 kJ/m2) induced a significant reduction of viable adherent cells, compared with non-irradiated cells. However, GrB depletion by antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a 4-fold reduction of cell loss, demonstrating that GrB is an important contributor to UVA-induced cell detachment. In additional experiments, we used the Falcon HTS Fluoroblok 24-Multiwell Insert System coated with fibronectin to investigate the effect of UVA-induced GrB production on keratinocytes motility. As shown in Fig. 7C, treatment with UVA irradiation resulted in a low but significant increase in HaCaT cell migration, compared with non-irradiated cells. However, GrB depletion dramatically enhanced cell motility with a magnitude amplification of ∼10-fold. Moreover, treatment with rGrB abrogated the migration capacity of keratinocytes depleted in endogenous GrB by antisense (Fig. 7C). Similar results were obtained with vitronectin (data not shown). Moreover, pre-treatment with anti-MIF antibody resulted in enhanced cell migration after UVA exposure, thus mimicking GrB depletion (data not shown). Altogether, these results confirm the role of GrB as an important player in cell detachment and survival in the context of the UVA response. Moreover, as an unexpected result, our study unmasked an important intrinsic potential of UVA to trigger keratinocyte migration. Finally, these results illustrate the potency of GrB to counteract the tremendous stimulatory effect of UVA on cell motility. In this work we have shown for the first time that, in keratinocytes, UVA irradiation induces GrB gene and protein expression. Our data support a model in which UVA induces a redox-dependent release of MIF, which, in turn, activates the production of active GrB through p38 MAPK. GrB accumulation was observed in immortalized HaCaT cells and normal human skin from different donors, suggesting that this event is not related to a specific cellular model or culture conditions. However, among skin cells, GrB induction upon UVA stimulation seems specific to keratinocytes, because it was not observed in primary dermal fibroblasts. In this perspective, it is also interesting to note that UVA-irradiated keratinocytes produced simultaneously GrB and MMP1, the former (see below), but not the latter (3McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 4Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), being able to cleave fibronectin, whereas fibroblasts produced MMP2 and MMP9, which are active against fibronectin, but not GrB. This result confirms that, upon UVA irradiation, keratinocytes and fibroblasts cooperate for producing various proteases with complementary properties for extracellular matrix remodeling. The fact that GrB up-regulation is part of the cellular response to stress induced by UVA irradiation was not totally unexpected. Indeed, not only GrB was detected in confluent keratinocytes (5Berthou C. Michel L. Soulie A. Jean-Louis F. Flageul B. Dubertret L. Sigaux F. Zhang Y. Sasportes M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5293-5300PubMed Google Scholar), but also we have recently described GrB production in keratinocytes following UVB irradiation (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and, in non-epithelial cells following genotoxic stress (12Bruno A.P. Lautier D. d'Orgeix A.T. Laurent G. Quillet-Mary A. Blood. 2000; 96: 1914-1920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also reported similar events in cells treated by inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα (17Guilloton F. de Thonel A. Jean C. Demur C. Mansat-De Mas V. Laurent G. Quillet-Mary A. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that, at least in a number of tissues, GrB induction may be part of a general response to cellular stress. The mechanism by which UVA up-regulates GrB has been also examined. Our study provides strong evidences that MIF is a central player in UVA-mediated GrB regulation. MIF, a pituitary-derived hormone, is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, including the skin. The role of MIF in the UVA response has been previously documented in dermal fibroblasts. In these cells, Watanabe and co-workers (11Watanabe H. Shimizu T. Nishihira J. Abe R. Nakayama T. Taniguchi M. Sabe H. Ishibashi T. Shimizu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1676-1683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have reported that UVA stimulates MIF production and that the event is critical for the production of MMP1, the principal fibroblast-derived secreted proteinase capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens of types I, II, III, and VII (3McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 4Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Combined with our results, MIF appears as an important mediator for the production of extracellular matrix-remodeling factors, such as at least MMP1 and GrB, but also, perhaps, other proteases. Clinical evidences of increased MIF expression in chronic inflammatory states or in skin diseases suggest that MIF may also operate in other conditions than in the context of UVA irradiation (for a review, see Ref. 18Shimizu T. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2005; 37: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Whether or not, in these conditions, MIF accumulation may result in GrB induction with similar functional consequences needs further information. The mechanism by which MIF stimulates GrB was also examined. UV irradiation induces various but coordinated signaling pathways, known as the UV response, which include ROS-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK (19Bowden G.T. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). By using chemical inhibitors, we describe that GrB induction by MIF (and by UVA) is dependent upon p38 MAPK. However, ERK, JNK, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways play no role in this regulation. The link between p38 MAPK activation and GrB has not been investigated. However, it should be noted that GrB promoter contains binding sites for AP1, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), core-binding factor, and Ikaros transcription factors (15Babichuk C.K. Duggan B.L. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16485-16493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Wargnier A. Legros-Maida S. Bosselut R. Bourge J.F. Lafaurie C. Ghysdael C.J. Sasportes M. Paul P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6930-6934Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, p38 MAPK can also activate CREB (20Butler M.P. Hanly J.A. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27759-27768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and AP1 transcription factors (21Chen R. Lim J.H. Jono H. Gu X.X. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Murphy T.F. Li J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Efimova T. LaCelle P. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24387-24395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Finally, some findings indicate that the p38 MAPK pathway contributes also to stabilization of mRNAs through an MAPKAPK2-dependent and AU-rich element-targeted mechanism (23Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, one could speculate that p38 MAPK acts directly through a CREB- or AP1-mediated transcriptional mechanism, and/or indirectly at a post-transcriptional level by stabilizing GrB mRNA. The significance and the functional consequences of GrB accumulation on the epidermis homeostasis following UVA irradiation were unknown. In this study, we have first provided direct evidences that GrB synthesized upon UVA irradiation was able to degrade purified fibronectin. This finding is in agreement with a recent study that elegantly shows that purified or recombinant GrB is able to cleave laminin, vitronectin, and fibronectin both in vitro and in cell culture (9Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The specificity of this enzyme for extracellular matrix components has also been described by adding purified GrB to smooth muscle cell culture (10Choy J.C. Hung V.H. Hunter A.L. Cheung P.K. Motyka B. Goping I.S. Sawchuk T. Bleackley R.C. Podor T.J. McManus B.M. Granville D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, our study raises the possibility that, following UVA, increased fibronectin synthesis and subsequent accumulation (2Boyer B. Fourtanier A. Kern P. Labat-Robert J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1992; 14: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) are counteracted by GrB production and fibronectin cleavage and that any disturbances of this balance may result in potentially severe alterations of the composition of extracellular protein components. In the two studies mentioned above (9Buzza M.S. Zamurs L. Sun J. Bird C.H. Smith A.I. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Nice E.C. Bird P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23549-23558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Choy J.C. Hung V.H. Hunter A.L. Cheung P.K. Motyka B. Goping I.S. Sawchuk T. Bleackley R.C. Podor T.J. McManus B.M. Granville D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it has been shown that GrB-mediated degradation of extracellular matrix structure resulted in the inhibition of cell spreading, cell detachment, and cell death via anoikis. Our study shows that UVA-induced GrB production also influences cell detachment and cell death in keratinocytes culture. Moreover, we provide direct evidences that GrB efficiently counteracts the stimulatory effect of UVA on cell motility. These findings suggest that GrB is an important factor for eliminating damaged cells through cell detachment following UVA irradiation. If this is the case, one could speculate that deficiency in GrB production should result in both cell death inhibition and cell migration facilitation, two effects that may have serious consequences in terms of skin organization and carcinogenesis. It is important to note that human GrB displays polymorphism with significant differences in terms of catalytic capacities (24McIlroy D. Cartron P.F. Tuffery P. Dudoit Y. Samri A. Autran B. Vallette F.M. Debre P. Theodorou I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2562-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the GrB allele profile influences long term UVA effects such as photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. Finally, it is interesting to note that, in contrast to UVB, UVA failed to confer cellular cytotoxicity capacity to keratinocytes (data not shown). The mechanism that underlies this difference is unclear. Indeed, as we have described for UVB (6Hernandez-Pigeon H. Jean C. Charruyer A. Haure M.J. Titeux M. Tonasso L. Quillet-Mary A. Baudouin C. Charveron M. Laurent G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13525-13532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), UVA also stimulates not only the production of GrB (this study) but also the accumulation of perforin in HaCaT cells (data not shown). These observations raise the possibility that UVB, but not UVA, irradiation activates mechanism resulting in cell-to-cell recognition and interaction required for target cell lysis. Combining our two studies, it appears that GrB could confer to keratinocyte the ability to degrade extracellular matrix components or the capacity to eliminate non-epithelial surrounding epidermal cells, depending on the UV source.

https://openalex.org/W1981925035,"Background Theoretical work suggests that data from multiple nuclear loci provide better estimates of population genetic parameters than do single loci, but just how many loci are needed and how much sequence is required from each has been little explored. Methodology/Principle Findings To investigate how much data is required to estimate the population genetic parameter θ (4Neμ) accurately under ideal circumstances, we simulated datasets of DNA sequences under three values of θ per site (0.1, 0.01, 0.001), varying in both the total number of base pairs sequenced per individual and the number of equal-length loci. From these datasets we estimated θ using the maximum likelihood coalescent framework implemented in the computer program Migrate. Our results corroborated the theoretical expectation that increasing the number of loci impacted the accuracy of the estimate more than increasing the sequence length at single loci. However, when the value of θ was low (0.001), the per-locus sequence length was also important for estimating θ accurately, something that has not been emphasized in previous work. Conclusions/Significance Accurate estimation of θ required data from at least 25 independently evolving loci. Beyond this, there was little added benefit in terms of decreasing the squared coefficient of variation of the coalescent estimates relative to the extra effort required to sample more loci."
https://openalex.org/W1971456880,"In the olfactory system of Drosophila, 50 functional classes of sensory receptor neurons (ORNs) project in a highly organized fashion into the CNS, where they sort out from one another and converge into distinct synaptic glomeruli. We identified the transmembrane molecule Semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a) as an essential component to ensure glomerulus-specific axon segregation. Removal of sema-1a in ORNs does not affect the pathfinding toward their target area but disrupts local axonal convergence into a single glomerulus, resulting in two distinct targeting phenotypes: axons either intermingle with adjacent ORN classes or segregate according to their odorant receptor identity into ectopic sites. Differential Sema-1a expression can be detected among neighboring glomeruli, and mosaic analyses show that sema-1a functions nonautonomously in ORN axon sorting. These findings provide insights into the mechanism by which afferent interactions lead to synaptic specificity in the olfactory system."
https://openalex.org/W2119396444,"Background The Botswana antiretroviral program began in 2002 and currently treats 42,000 patients, with a goal of treating 85,000 by 2009. The World Health Organization (WHO) has begun to implement a surveillance system for detecting transmitted resistance that exceeds a threshold of 5%. However, the WHO has not determined when this threshold will be reached. Here we model the Botswana government's treatment plan and predict, to 2009, the likely stochastic evolution of transmitted resistance. Methods We developed a model of the stochastic evolution of drug-resistant strains and formulated a birth-death Master equation. We analyzed this equation to obtain an analytical solution of the probabilistic evolutionary trajectory for transmitted resistance, and used treatment and demographic data from Botswana. We determined the temporal dynamics of transmitted resistance as a function of: (i) the transmissibility (i.e., fitness) of the drug-resistant strains that may evolve and (ii) the rate of acquired resistance. Results Transmitted resistance in Botswana will be unlikely to exceed the WHO's threshold by 2009 even if the rate of acquired resistance is high and the strains that evolve are half as fit as the wild-type strains. However, we also found that transmission of drug-resistant strains in Botswana could increase to ∼15% by 2009 if the drug-resistant strains that evolve are as fit as the wild-type strains. Conclusions Transmitted resistance will only be detected by the WHO (by 2009) if the strains that evolve are extremely fit and acquired resistance is high. Initially after a treatment program is begun a threshold lower than 5% should be used; and we advise that predictions should be made before setting a threshold. Our results indicate that it may be several years before the WHO's surveillance system is likely to detect transmitted resistance in other resource-poor countries that have significantly less ambitious treatment programs than Botswana."

Accumulating evidence suggests that actin and its associated proteins play a crucial role in podosome dynamics. Caldesmon is localized to the podosomes, and its expression is down-regulated in transformed and cancer cells. Here we studied the regulatory mode of caldesmon in podosome formation in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed fibroblasts. Exogenous expression analyses revealed that caldesmon represses podosome formation triggered by the N-WASP-Arp2/3 pathway. Conversely, depletion of caldesmon by RNA interference induces numerous small-sized podosomes with high dynamics. Caldesmon competes with the Arp2/3 complex for actin binding and thereby inhibits podosome formation. p21-activated kinases (PAK)1 and 2 are also repressors of podosome formation via phosphorylation of caldesmon. Consequently, phosphorylation of caldesmon by PAK1/2 enhances this regulatory mode of caldesmon. Taken together, we conclude that in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells, changes in the balance between PAK1/2-regulated caldesmon and the Arp2/3 complex govern the formation of podosomes.

As podosomes and invadopodia appear to be similar in morphology, functions, and molecular compositions, they are considered to be related structures with different cellular contexts. The podosomes are composed of actin, its associated proteins, and signaling molecules (2Sobue K. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 13: S80-S91Google Scholar, 3Linder S. Aepfelbacher M.

Neural WASP (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex are also localized to the podosomes (10Linder S. Nelson D. Weiss M. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, blocking the functions of N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex using dominant-negative mutants and RNA interference inhibits podosome formation (11Mizutani K. Miki H. He H. Maruta H. Takenawa T.

Caldesmon (CaD), which is an actin- and calmodulin-binding protein, controls smooth muscle and non-muscle actin-myosin interactions (14Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Fujita M. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Two different molecular weight (Mr) isoforms of CaD are identified: high molecular weight CaD (h-CaD; 120-150 kDa) and low molecular weight CaD (l-CaD; 70-80 kDa). They are generated from a single gene by alternative splicing. h-CaD is exclusively expressed in smooth muscle cells, but l-CaD is widely distributed in non-muscle cells (15Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J.

In addition to controlling actin-myosin interactions, l-CaD in collaboration with tropomyosin (TM) stabilizes parallel actin filaments (16Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro reconstitution experiments further revealed that CaD competes with filamin, Arp2/3 complex, and cofilin to bind to F-actin (17Nomura M. Yoshikawa K. Tanaka T. Sobue K. Maruyama K. Eur. J.

The significance of the expression and localization, however, remained unclear. During the preparation of this manuscript, Eves et al. (24Eves R. Webb B.A. Zhou S. Mak A.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1691-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have reported a role of CaD in the negative regulation of podosome formation in smooth muscle A7r5 cells. Here we provided additional information that extends the understanding of the molecular mechanism of CaD-regulated podosome formation. We clearly demonstrated that changes in the balance between CaD regulated by p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and the N-WASP-Arp2/3 pathway dictate the formation of podosomes in RSV-transformed cells. Cell Culture—BY1 is a clonal line of RSV-transformed 3Y1 cells derived from Fisher rat embryos (25Kimura G. Itagaki A. Summers J. Int. J. Cancer. 1975; 15: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Expression Vectors and Transfection—Coding regions of rat Arp3, PAK1, and PAK2 were amplified by PCR using 3Y1 cDNA as the template. The coding region of human l-CaD used was as described previously (26Hayashi K. Yano H. Hashida T. Takeuchi R. Takeda O. Asada K. Takahashi E. Kato I. Sobue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each fragment was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). The pEGFP-Arp3 and pDsRed-CaD vectors were constructed by inserting the coding sequence of rat Arp3 or human l-CaD into pEGFP-C2 Vector or pDsRed-Monomer-C1 Vector (Clontech). The pcDNA3.1(+)-GFP-actin vector was constructed by inserting the coding sequence of human β-actin into pEGFP-C2. pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-CaD(S479/509A), pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-CaD(S479/509D), pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-PAK1(K298R), pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-PAK4(K352/353A), and pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-PAK1(T422E) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. pCAGGS-myc-Rac1-V12, pCAGGS-myc-Rac1-N17, pCAGGS-myc-Cdc42-V12, and pCAGGS-myc-Cdc42-N17 were prepared as described previously (27Konno D. Yoshimura S. Hori K. Maruoka H. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5082-5088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BY1 cells were transfected with these expression vectors using Optifect transfection reagent (Invitrogen). To establish stable cell lines expressing HA-CaD, BY1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-CaD. These cells were cultured with 100 μg/ml G418, and the drug-resistant clones were isolated. Immunofluorescence Microscopic and Time-lapse Image Analyses—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were incubated with primary antibody, followed by the appropriate secondary antibody. To visualize actin filaments, Alexa 568- or Alexa 350-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was added with the secondary antibody solution. When endogenous CaD and PAK1 were doubly stained, anti-CaD antibody was labeled using the Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit IgG labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Because the expression levels of endogenous PAK1 and PAK2 were too low in BY1 cells to be detected by immunostaining, immunoreaction-enhanced Can Get Signal immunostain (Toyobo) was used as a dilution solution for the antibodies. Antibodies used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1. For time-lapse image analysis, BY1 cells were transfected with CaD siRNA (CaD-depleted cells) or scrambled siRNA (control cells). After 2 days of transfection, the cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-GFP-actin, and GFP fluorescence was observed every 20 s under the Axiovert 200 (Carl Zeiss). Actin Binding Assay—F-actin was polymerized in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm phalloidin, 0.2 mm ATP) for 40 min at 30 °C. After polymerization, a 0.3 or 0.6 μm C-terminal fragment of CaD (CaD39 (28Novy R.E. Sellers J.R. Liu L.F. Lin J.J.C. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Next, 10 nm Arp2/3 complex (Cytoskeleton Inc.) and 50 nm GST-VCA (Cytoskeleton Inc.) were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. After the incubation, the samples were spun (105,000 × g, 2 h) to collect the F-actin associated with CaD and the Arp2/3 complex. The proteins in the pellets were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, and detected by immunoblot using the respective antibody. Actin Polymerization Assay—Actin polymerization assay was performed using the actin polymerization biochem kit (Cytoskeleton Inc.). Briefly, 0.4 mg/ml pyrene-labeled actin was mixed with 15 nm Arp2/3 complex, 50 nm GST-VCA, and 0-1 μm recombinant CaD39 in general actin buffer, in which 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to prevent the dimerization of CaD protein. The pyrene fluorescence signal was measured by Spectra Max Gemini microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices) every 7 s from just after the addition of actin polymerization buffer. Co-immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science) (pH 7.5)) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The lysates were spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. After incubation, protein A-Sepharose or protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the mixtures, which were incubated overnight at 4 °C. To elute the immunocomplexes, the Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and SDS-sample buffer was then added. RNA Interference—Sequences of siRNAs used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 2. Cells were transfected with these siRNAs using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and cultured for 3 days before analysis. Expression and Localization of Caldesmon, Tropomyosin, N-WASP, and the Arp2/3 Complex in Fibroblasts and Their RSV Trans-formants—CaD and TM bind to parallel actin filaments, stabilizing their alignment (16Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7490-7497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the N-WASP-Arp2/3 pathway induces the branching of actin filaments (29Mullins R.D. Heuser J.A. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6181-6186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of these actin-associated proteins in podosome formation, we compared their expression and localization in a rat fibroblast cell line (3Y1) and its RSV-transformant cell line (BY1). Consistent with our previous findings (22Tanaka J. Watanabe T. Nakamura N. Sobue K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 595-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), l-CaD and high molecular weight TMs (TM1 and TM2) proteins were markedly reduced in BY1 cells compared with parental 3Y1 cells. Low molecular weight TM was expressed at the same levels in both cell lines. The N-WASP protein expression was greater in BY1 cells than in 3Y1 cells, whereas Cdc42, an activator of N-WASP, and the Arp2/3 complex (p34 Arc and p21 Arc subunits), a downstream target of N-WASP, were expressed at the same levels in both lines (Fig. 1A). Because the 3Y1 and BY1 cells examined expressed only l-CaD, we refer to l-CaD as CaD throughout this study, unless otherwise noted. In 3Y1 cells, CaD and TM were localized along stress fibers, whereas N-WASP and a subunit (p34 Arc) of the Arp2/3 complex were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, with a limited accumulation at the ruffling membrane (Fig. 1B). In BY1 cells, dot-shaped F-actin clusters were predominant in the podosomes, replacing stress fibers. CaD, N-WASP, and p34 Arc were concentrated in the core of podosomes, and TM was diffusely distributed within podosomes (Fig. 1B). Three-dimensional reconstruction along the z axis revealed that CaD and TM were preferentially localized to the tip domain of the podosomes, whereas N-WASP and p34 Arc were concentrated at their base (Fig. 1B, insets). To further compare the localizations of the Arp2/3 complex and CaD, we co-expressed trace amounts of GFP-Arp3 and DsRed-CaD in BY1 cells, and we determined their localizations by three-dimensional reconstruction. They partially overlapped each other within the podosomes located at the ventral side of BY1 cells. GFP-Arp3 was mainly concentrated at the podosomal base, whereas DsRed-CaD was preferentially localized to the tip domain (Fig. 1C). These distinct localizations support a recent finding (13Lorenz M. Yamaguchi H. Wang Y. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 697-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) that N-WASP- and Arp2/3-mediated nucleation and branching network formation of actin initially occurs at the base, followed by the elongation of parallel actin filaments within the invadopodia. Caldesmon as a Repressor of Podosome Formation—Because CaD expression was markedly down-regulated in BY1 cells, we examined the effect of HA-tagged CaD overexpression on podosome formation. HA-CaD reduced the number of podosomes and induced a flattened cell morphology and the formation of cortical actin bundles with thin stress fibers (Fig. 2A). We then cloned stable cell lines expressing HA-CaD from the transfected BY1 cells (BY1-CaD cells). The total amounts of exogenous and endogenous CaD in two BY1-CaD (C4 and C11) clones were nearly equivalent to that of endogenous CaD in 3Y1 cells (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this, these two clones showed a reduced number of podosomes (the average numbers of podosomes per cell: 31.2 ± 2.2 in BY1 cells, 12.4 ± 4.7 in BY1-CaD (C4) cells, and 10.9 ± 4.3 in BY1-CaD(C11) cells), flattened cell morphology, and formation of thin actin bundles (Fig. 2C). We examined the effect of CaD depletion on podosome formation using siRNA (Fig. 2, D and E). The CaD-depleted BY1 cells had numerous small-sized podosomes at the ventral surface (the average numbers of podosomes per cell: 34.7 ± 2.6 in control BY1 cells and 219.4 ± 29.1 in CaD-depleted BY1 cells). They frequently formed belt-like structures along the cell periphery. Unlike osteoclasts, these structures never formed sealing zones. Compared with podosomes of control cells, small podosomes in CaD-depleted cells were highly dynamic; the positions of small podosomes changed dynamically from the cell periphery to the center of the ventral cell surface and vice versa (Fig. 2F and supplemental Videos 1 (control cells) and 2 (CaD-depleted cells)). The lifetime of small podosomes in CaD-depleted cells, as determined by following individual podosomes visualized by GFP-actin, was shorter than that in control cells (average lifetimes of podosomes: 52.0 ± 6.4 s in CaD-depleted cells and 184.8 ± 10.6 s in control cells) (Fig. 2G). Competition between CaD and the Arp2/3 Complex Regulates Podosome Formation—CaD-depleted cells had numerous small podosomes in which the p34 Arc subunit of the Arp2/3 complex was highly concentrated (Fig. 3A). In agreement with a previous report (12Yamaguchi H. Lorenz M. Kempiak S. Sarmiento C. Coniglio S. Symons M. Segall J. Eddy R. Miki H. Takenawa T. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), the depletion of p34 Arc from BY1 cells resulted in the disassembly of podosomes and the formation of cortical actin bundles that co-localized with CaD (Fig. 3, B-D). This phenotype is similar to that of BY1 cells expressing exogenous CaD, as shown in Fig. 2A. Depletion of both CaD and p34 Arc partially reversed this effect (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that the remaining Arp2/3 complex can form podosomes under CaD-depleted conditions. These combined results suggest that the balance between the relative expression levels of CaD and the Arp2/3 complex is critical for podosome formation. In connection with this, Yamakita et al. (18Yamakita Y. Oosawa F. Yamashiro S. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17937-17944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that CaD reduces the affinity of the Arp2/3 complex for F-actin, thereby preventing the Arp2/3-dependent nucleation of actin in vitro. To confirm the competition between CaD and the Arp2/3 complex for actin binding and nucleation, we performed an in vitro co-sedimentation assay and actin polymerization assay using recombinant CaD and the Arp2/3 complex. We found that CaD inhibited both Arp2/3 complex binding to F-actin and Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, E and F). Modification of CaD Function in Podosome Formation by PAK Phosphorylation—It has been well documented that CaD is highly phosphorylated by many kinds of kinases, such as Cdc2 kinase (30Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), ERK (31Childs T.J. Watson M.H. Sanghera J.S. Campbell D.L. Pelech S.L. Mak A.S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1990; 188: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (34Hettasch J.M. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11876-11881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and p38 MAPK (35Hedges J.C. Yamboliev I.A. Ngo M. Horowitz B. Adam L.P. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C527-C534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PAK has been also reported as an important kinase for modification of CaD function (36Foster D.B. Shen L.H. Kelly J. Thibault P. Van Eyk J.E. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Eppinga R.D. Li Y. Lin J.L. Mak A.S. Lin J.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2006; 63: 543-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In BY1 cells, the expression levels of PAK1 and PAK2 were low compared with those in 3Y1 cells (Fig. 4A). PAK3 was not detected in either cell line. Additionally, PAK1 and PAK2 were mainly colocalized in the core region of podosomes with CaD and also in the more peripheral area of podosomes (Fig. 4B). From these results, we investigated the relationship between CaD and PAKs in podosome formation. Foster et al. (36Foster D.B. Shen L.H. Kelly J. Thibault P. Van Eyk J.E. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1959-1965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) determined two serine sites of CaD as phosphorylation sites by PAK. To analyze the functional significance of CaD phosphorylation by PAK, we constructed expression vectors of mutant CaD proteins in which the two serine sites were replaced with alanine (CaD(AA)) or aspartate (CaD(DD)). The expression of CaD(DD) in BY1 cells inhibited podosome formation to a similar extent as wild-type CaD (CaD (WT)), whereas CaD(AA) showed a less significant effect (Fig. 5, A and B). Additionally, CaD(WT) and CaD(DD) rescued the aberrant podosome formation in CaD-depleted BY1 cells, whereas CaD(AA) scarcely reduced the number of podosomes in CaD-depleted BY1 cells (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that the phosphorylation of CaD by PAK1 and/or PAK2 enhances the CaD-induced inhibition of podosome formation.FIGURE 5The mutations of PAK phosphorylation sites of CaD. A, BY1 cells transfected with GFP, HA-CaD, HA-CaD(AA), or HA-CaD(DD) were stained with anti-HA antibody (green) and phalloidin (red). Scale bar, 20 μm. B, BY1 cells expressing GFP, HA-CaD, HA-CaD(AA), or HA-CaD(DD) were counted and classified according to their phenotypes as follows: no effect (black bars), compared with nontransfected BY1 cells; weak effect (white bars), slightly decreased number of podosomes; strong effect (gray bars), markedly disassembled podosomes and new formation of cortical actin bundles with thin stress fibers. Statistical analysis was carried out for three independent experiments. One hundred cells per sample were counted in each experiment. C, BY1 cells were transfected with CaD siRNA. After 2 days of transfection, cells were respectively transfected with HA-CaD(WT), HA-CaD(AA), or HA-CaD(DD) and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then stained with anti-HA antibody (green) and phalloidin (red). Scale bar, 20 μm. D, whole cell extracts of BY1 cells transfected with HA-CaD, HA-CaD(AA), or HA-CaD(DD) were prepared, and immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using anti-HA antibody. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblot (IB) using the indicated antibodies. E, amounts of p34 Arc and actin in the precipitates were determined from immunoblot (D) and expressed as the amounts of p34 Arc per unit of actin. Statistical analysis was carried out for three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 3, CaD competes with the Arp2/3 complex for actin binding in vitro and podosome formation. To analyze whether this competition is further modulated by the PAK-dependent phosphorylation of CaD, we transfected HA-tagged CaD(WT), CaD(AA), or CaD(DD) into BY1 cells and collected the CaD-actin-Arp2/3 complex from the extracts of transfected cells by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody. When HA-CaD(WT) or HA-CaD(DD) was expressed in BY1 cells, only a little Arp2/3 complex was co-immunoprecipitated with actin. In contrast, the amount of Arp2/3 complex bound to actin in BY1 cells expressing HA-CaD(AA) was 5-fold higher than that in the HA-CaD(WT)- or HA-CaD(DD)-expressing cells (Fig. 5, D and E). These data suggest that the phosphorylation of CaD by PAKs enhances its inhibitory effect on podosome formation by increasing its ability to compete with the Arp2/3 complex. Inhibitory Function of PAK in Podosome Formation—To further analyze the involvement of PAK1 and PAK2 in podosome formation, we depleted or overexpressed these kinases in BY1 cells. Like CaD-depleted cells, PAK1- and/or PAK2-depleted cells had numerous small podosomes. Most cells displayed belt-like organization or large clusters of small podosomes (Fig. 6, A and B). The expression of HA-PAK1 or HA-PAK2 markedly induced podosome disassembly and the formation of cortical actin bundles (Fig. 6, C and D). Although exogenous PAK3 expression also impaired podosome formation, its efficiency was much lower than that of PAK1 and PAK2. The formation of cortical actin bundles was less significant in PAK3-transfected BY1 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). We also confirmed that the expression level of endogenous CaD was not altered by PAK1/2 overexpression and PAK1/2 depletion (Fig. 6E). These data indicate that both"

Here, we show that caldendrin, a variant of CaBP1 enriched in the brain, interacts with and distinctly modulates Cav1.2 (L-type) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels relative to other Ca2+-binding proteins. Caldendrin binds to the C-terminal IQ-domain of the pore-forming α1-subunit of Cav1.2 (α11.2) and competitively displaces calmodulin and CaBP1 from this site. Compared with CaBP1, caldendrin causes a more modest suppression of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Cav1.2 through a different subset of molecular determinants. Caldendrin does not bind to the N-terminal domain of α11.2, a site that is critical for functional interactions of the channel with CaBP1. Deletion of the N-terminal domain inhibits CaBP1, but spares caldendrin modulation of Cav1.2 inactivation. In contrast, mutations of the IQ-domain abolish physical and functional interactions of caldendrin and Cav1.2, but do not prevent channel modulation by CaBP1. Using antibodies specific for caldendrin and Cav1.2, we show that caldendrin coimmunoprecipitates with Cav1.2 from the brain and colocalizes with Cav1.2 in somatodendritic puncta of cortical neurons in culture. Our findings reveal functional diversity within related Ca2+-binding proteins, which may enhance the specificity of Ca2+ signaling by Cav1.2 channels in different cellular contexts.

First, while the C-terminal-half of caldendrin is identical to that in CaBP1, the N-terminal half of caldendrin is unique and lacks a site for myristoylation (2Seidenbecher C.I. Langnaese K. Sanmarti-Vila L. Boeckers T.M. Smalla K.H. Sabel B.A. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol.

Because myristoylation of CaBP1 is required for its ability to enhance inactivation of Cav2.1 (24Few A.P. Lautermilch N.J. Westenbroek R.E. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7071-7080Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the absence of this modification may confer caldendrin with distinct regulatory capabilities. Second, caldendrin mRNA has been detected in different neuronal populations than that for CaBP1 by in situ hybridization (3Laube G. Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Dieterich D.C. Hoffmann B. Landwehr M.

These findings raise the possibility that caldendrin may differentially modulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in separate subgroups of neurons in the brain.Like caldendrin, Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels are prominently localized in somatodendritic compartments in neurons (25Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J.

Based on the similar cellular and subcellular distribution of caldendrin and Cav1.2 in the brain, we investigated the significance of caldendrin as a modulator of Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels. We show that caldendrin physically and functionally interacts with Cav1.2 in unexpectedly different ways than CaBP1. Caldendrin associates with Cav1.2 in the brain and colocalizes with Cav1.2 in somatodendritic compartments of isolated neurons. Our results suggest a novel role for caldendrin in regulating Ca2+ signals and further underscore the importance of such neuron-specific Ca2+-binding proteins in conferring heterogeneous modes of target regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs and Molecular Biology—For electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, Cav1.2 subunit cDNAs were α11.2 (rbcII), β2A, and α2δ (31Snutch T.P.

A caldendrin cDNA corresponding to the published sequence (GenBank™ Y17408) was amplified by PCR as two fragments corresponding to nucleotides 1-411 and 387-897 from rat brain cDNA (Clontech) with the following primers (non-homologous nucleotides are in lowercase): AL86 (gcATGAGCTCGCACATCGCCAAGAGC) and AL88 (GCGCAGCTGGTGGAGGAACGGaTCCGCCTCGGGGTTGCCAGC); and AL89 (gcaGGAtCCGTTCCTCCACCAGCTGCGCCCCATGC) and AL85 (gcTCAGCGAGACATCATCCGGACAAA). AL88 and AL89 incorporated a silent BamHI site (underlined). The PCR fragments were cloned separately into PCR-4-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the C-terminal fragment was excised and cloned as a BamHI/SpeI into the plasmid containing the N-terminal fragment. The entire caldendrin cDNA was then cloned into EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) and confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to mammalian cell expression. His6-caldendrin was constructed by subcloning into EcoRI sites of pTrcHisb (Invitrogen).Preparation and Purification of Caldendrin and α11.2 Antibodies—A GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1-135 of rat caldendrin was generated by subcloning the corresponding cDNA into BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. The fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, purified according to standard protocols, and used for immunization of rabbits by a commercial source (Covance Research Products Inc., Denver, PA). For α11.2 antibodies, rabbit antiserum was generated (Prosci, Inc., Poway, CA) against a peptide corresponding to a sequence in rat α11.2 (C KYT TKI NMD DLQ PSE NED KS) used previously for the generation of α11.2-specific antibodies (25Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Warner C. Ahlijanian M.K. Prystay W. Gilbert M.M. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 949-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The α11.2 antibodies were specific in that they recognized α11.2 in transfected cells and in brain lysate by Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry (not shown). Caldendrin and α11.2 antibodies were affinity-purified on columns containing the corresponding immunogen prior to use.Binding Assays—HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbec-co’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere under 7% CO2. Cells were grown to ∼70-80% confluence and transfected with Gene Porter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells plated on 150-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of caldendrin or CaBP1-S cDNA. Two days later, cells were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, with protease inhibitors: 17 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.4), and membrane proteins were solubilized by rotating at 4 °C for 30 min. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used immediately or aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. GST-α11.2 fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with purified CaM (5 μg, Sigma-Aldrich) or transfected cell lysates in a total volume of 1 ml with binding buffer (Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.3), 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA at 4 °C, rotating for 4 h. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer (1 ml), and bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Caldendrin or CaM was detected by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CaBP1/caldendrin (UW72, 1:1000 (14Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Verlinde C.L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Blots were processed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG 1:4000, anti-mouse IgG 1:4000) and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Biosciences).For competitive binding assays, His6-caldendrin and His6-CaBP1-L were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli, purified, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). GST-α11.2 fragments immobilized on glutathione beads were preincubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 0.05 μm His6-caldendrin, His6-CaBP1-L, or purified CaM (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (TBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors). Varying concentrations of the competing protein were added and the reaction continued for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in binding buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to His6 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), pan-CaBP1, or CaM antibodies as described above.Coimmunoprecipitation Assays—For coimmunoprecipitation from transfected cells, HEK293T cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of FLAG-α11.2 (wild-type or with ΔNT or IQ-EE mutations), α2δ, β2A, and caldendrin with or without CaBP1-L. After 42 h, cells were lysed, and membrane proteins solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4 °C, and subjected to centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated with caldendrin or α11.2 antibodies (8 μg) for 1 h, followed by the addition of preswollen protein A-Sepharose (50 μl, 50% slurry) for 2 h and washed three times in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting with antibodies against α11.2 (1:5000) and caldendrin (1:4000) or CaBP1 (UW72, 1:4000).For immunoprecipitation from brain, frozen brains from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AK). For one experiment, one brain was homogenized in ice-cold buffer (4 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors) and large debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in ice-cold solubilization buffer (8 ml; 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min on ice and insoluble material removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (0.5 ml) was incubated with antibodies against caldendrin or control rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA) (10 μg) for 4 h, rotating at 4 °C. Pre-swollen protein A-Sepharose (50 μl of 50% slurry) was washed three times with solubilization buffer and added to immunoprecipitation reactions. After further incubation, rotating at 4 °C over-night, the beads were washed, and immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting. For Fig. 7, C and D, the blot was incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 1% SDS, 3.1% dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 50 °C prior to re-probing with CaM or CaBP1 antibodies.Immunocytochemistry of Primary Neurons in Culture—Primary cultures of neurons were prepared from neocortical tissue dissected from rat embryos (E19). The tissue was incubated with papain for 1 h at 37 °C and triturated in inactivation solution (minimum essential medium, MEM (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum). The resulting cell suspension was plated at a density of ∼300,000 neurons per 60-mm plate containing glass coverslips that were precoated with poly-d-lysine. Neurons were maintained in medium containing MEM, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.6% dextrose, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1X B-27 (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, and 0.001% MITO and serum extender (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). After 16-21 days in culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraform-aldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) for 20 min, rinsed in TBS, and blocked for 30 min in TBS containing 10% NGS and 0.1% Triton X-100. All antibodies were diluted in TBS containing 2.5% NGS and 0.1% Triton X-100, and cells were rinsed three times for 5 min following each incubation period. All fluorescent secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. After blocking, cells were incubated with caldendrin antibodies (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature and after rinsing, with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit Fab fragments (1:200) for 30 min. Before double-labeling, cells were blocked with goat anti-rabbit Fab fragments (1:200) for 20 min. Cells were then incubated with α11.2 antibodies (1:100) overnight at 4 °C and after rinsing, with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1300) for 1 h and subsequently with FITC-avidin (1:1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, MA). Coverslips were washed and mounted on glass slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) prior to viewing with a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. Image processing was performed with Zeiss LSM Image Browser and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA) software and quantitatively analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Co., Downingtown, PA). All images were thresholded to similar levels to obtain representative images. Fluorescent signal colocalization was determined from optical sections (1 μm) taken from the central plane of the neuron. Pixels containing both fluorescent signals were considered colocalized, and this value was expressed as a percentage of the total number of pixels positive for one fluorochrome.Electrophysiological Recordings—HEK293T cells were transfected with a total of 5 μg of DNA (Cav1.2 subunits: α11.2, β2A, α2δ) including 0.2 μg of a pEGFP-N1, caldendrin/pEGFPN1, or CaBP1-S/pEGFPN1 for fluorescent detection of transfected cells. 24-48 h after transfection, whole cell patch clamp recordings of transfected cells were acquired with a HEKA Elektronik (Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier. Data acquisition and leak subtraction using a P/-4 protocol were performed with Pulse software (HEKA Electronik). Extracellular recording solutions contained (in mm): 150 Tris, 2 MgCl2, and 10 or 20 CaCl2 or BaCl2. Intracellular solutions contained (in mm): 140 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 HEPES, 2 MgCl2, 2-MgATP, and 5 EGTA. The pH of the recording solutions was adjusted to 7.3 with methanesulfonic acid. Series resistance was ∼2-4 MΩ, compensated up to 70%. Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10-20 kHz. I-V curves were fit by Equation 1, 1=g(V-E)/{1+exp[(V1/2-V)/k]}Eq. 1 where g is maximum conductance, V is test voltage, E is apparent reversal potential, V½ is half-maximal activation, and k is the slope factor. Data were analyzed using Igor software (Wave-Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and graphs plotted with Sigma Plot (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Statistical comparisons between groups were made by Student’s t test.RESULTSCaldendrin Binds to the α1-Subunit of Cav1.2—CaM binding to a well-characterized IQ-domain and pre-IQ-domain in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of the Cav1.2 α1-subunit (α11.2) mediates a negative feedback regulation of incoming Ca2+ ions known as Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) (21Zuöhlke R.D.

Although CaBP1 also binds to the IQ-domain, we have shown that CaBP1 binding to the N-terminal domain (NT) of α11.2 is essential for suppressing CDI (17Zhou H. Yu K. McCoy K.L. Lee A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29612-29619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To gain insight into how caldendrin might regulate Cav1.2, we identified the sites in α11.2 with which caldendrin interacts in pull-down assays with GST-tagged fragments of the cytoplasmic domains of α11.2 (Fig. 1A). As we have shown previously, CaM and CaBP1 interacted with the NT, but only CaBP1 bound the NT both with and without Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Despite its similarity to CaBP1, caldendrin did not bind to the NT either in the presence or absence of Ca2+. This result demonstrates the specificity with which even highly related Ca2+-binding proteins can interact with the same target sequence. Like CaBP1 (16Zhou H. Kim S.A. Kirk E.A. Tippens A.L. Sun H. Haeseleer F. Lee A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4698-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), caldendrin bound both with and without Ca2+ to a C-terminal fragment of α11.2 that included both the IQ and Pre-IQ region (CT1, Fig. 1, A and C). The absence of caldendrin and CaBP1 binding to a fragment downstream of this region (CT2, Fig. 1A) confirmed the specificity of the interaction. Further analyses showed that like CaBP1, caldendrin binds to the Pre-IQ sites (CT7) both with and without Ca2+ and to the IQ-domain (CT6) stronger in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1C). These results suggested that caldendrin and CaBP1 constitutively associate with the Pre-IQ region and exhibit some Ca2+-dependent binding to the IQ-domain. Under the same assay conditions where Ca2+-independent binding was assessed in the presence of EGTA, CaM showed strictly Ca2+-dependent binding to CT1 and CT6 and weak Ca2+-independent binding to CT7 (Fig. 1C). Previous studies showed that in biochemical assays, CaM does not bind to Pre-IQ or IQ sites in the complete absence of Ca2+, but requires nanomolar concentrations of Ca2+ (35Pitt G.S. Zuöhlke R.D.

Thus, our results high-light differences in the Ca2+ requirements for CaBP1/caldendrin and CaM association with the α11.2 C-terminal domain.FIGURE 1Caldendrin binds to a subset of sites in α11.2 that interact with CaM and CaBP1.

https://openalex.org/W2053153169,"Baló's concentric sclerosis is a rare atypical form of multiple sclerosis characterized by striking concentric demyelination patterns. We propose a robust mathematical model for Baló's sclerosis, sharing common molecular and cellular mechanisms with multiple sclerosis. A reconsideration of the analogies between Baló's sclerosis and the Liesegang periodic precipitation phenomenon led us to propose a chemotactic cellular model for this disease. Rings of demyelination appear as a result of self-organization processes, and closely mimic Baló lesions. According to our results, homogeneous and concentric demyelinations may be two different macroscopic outcomes of a single fundamental immune disorder. Furthermore, in chemotactic models, cellular aggressivity appears to play a central role in pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W2077219446,"Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) modulates the opioid system by exerting functional anti-opioid activity on neurons, the mechanism of which is unknown. By using a model of SH-SY5Y cells, we recently postulated that anti-opioid activity likely takes place upstream from the signaling cascade, suggesting that NPFF receptors could block opioid receptors by physical interaction. In the present study, fluorescence techniques were used to monitor the physical association and the dynamic of NPFF2 and μ-opioid (MOP) receptors tagged with variants of the green fluorescent protein. Importantly, cyan fluorescent protein-tagged NPFF2 receptors retained their capacity to antagonize opioid receptors. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that NPFF and MOP receptors are close enough to generate a basal FRET signal. The opioid agonist Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-Gly-ol disrupts by 20-30% this FRET signal, mainly because it concomitantly induces 40% internalization of receptors. In contrast, the NPFF analog 1DMe significantly increases by 10-15% the basal FRET signal, suggesting an association between both receptors. In addition, 1DMe reduces, by half, MOP receptor internalization, indicating that, besides a functional blockade of opioid receptors, the NPFF analog also inhibits their internalization. Finally, as a first report showing the modulation of the mobility of a G-protein-coupled receptor by another one, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis reveals that 1DMe modifies the lateral diffusion of MOP receptors in the cell membrane, changing them from a confined to a freely diffusing state. By promoting NPFF-MOP receptor heteromerization, 1DMe could disrupt the domain organization of MOP receptors in the membrane, resulting in a reduction of opioid response.

NPFF (FLFQPQRFamide) 2The abbreviations used are: NPFF, neuropeptide FF; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; MOP, μ-opioid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; vrFRAP, FRAP at variable observation radius; DAMGO, Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-gly-ol; FRETc, FRET with values corrected; 1DMe, d-Tyr-Leu-(NMe)Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Arg-Phe-NH2. is representative of a family of RFamide peptides shown to regulate pain, cardiovascular functions, appetite, thirst, and body temperature (1Zajac J.M. Mollereau C. Peptides. 2006; 27: 941-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 2Panula P. Aarnisalo A.A. Wasowicz K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 48: 461-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). NPFF is part of a neuropeptidergic system composed of two precursors, pro-NPFFA and pro-NPFFB, and of two specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), NPFF1 and NPFF2 (3Zajac J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A close relationship between NPFF and opioid systems exists in the central nervous system, because the pharmacological and physiological effects of opioids, especially in pain perception, are modulated (increased or decreased, depending on dose and site of action) by NPFF agonists (4Harrison L.M. Kastin A.J. Zadina J.E. Peptides. 1998; 19: 1603-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 5Cesselin F. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 1995; 9: 409-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Panula P. Kalso E. Nieminen M. Kontinen V.K. Brandt A. Pertovaara A. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7Roumy M. Zajac J.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 345: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The NPFF system is therefore considered to be an opioid-modulating system involved in homeostasis that counteracts the action of opioids and, thus, plays a role in opiate tolerance (8Rothman R.B. Synapse. 1992; 12: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Much data indicate that, at the cellular level, stimulation of NPFF receptors inactivates opioid receptors by a molecular mechanism still not understood (for review, see Ref. 9Mollereau C. Roumy M. Zajac J.M. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2005; 5: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For example, the NPFF analog 1DMe blocks presynaptic δ-opioid auto-receptors in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in K+-evoked met-enkephalin release (10Mauborgne A. Bourgoin S. Polienor H. Roumy M. Simonnet G. Zajac J.M. Cesselin F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 430: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 1DMe also inhibits the reduction induced by morphine, but not by noradrenalin, of the electrically evoked acetylcholine release in the guinea pig myenteric plexus (11Takeuchi T. Fujita A. Roumy M. Zajac J.M. Hata F. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 86: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, on isolated neurons from rat periventricular and dorsal raphe nuclei, that co-express nociceptin receptors and NPFF1 or NPFF2 receptors, respectively, NPFF analogs inhibit the nociceptin-induced reduction of N-type Ca2+ channel conductance (12Roumy M. Zajac J. Brain Res. 1999; 845: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Roumy M. Garnier M. Zajac J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 348: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-opioid activity of NPFF on neurons, we have recently developed a suitable cellular model by stably transfecting human NPFF1 or NPFF2 receptors in the neuroblastoma-derived cell line SH-SY5Y (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Kersante F. Mollereau C. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Peptides. 2006; 27: 980-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The neuroblastoma clone SH-SY5Y, derived from a human sympathetic ganglion tumor, displays many properties of mature sympathetic neurons, in particular the synthesis and depolarization-evoked, Ca2+-dependent, secretion of noradrenalin (16Vaughan P.F. Peers C. Walker J.H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1191-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In these cells, μ-opioid and nociceptin receptor activation leads, as in neurons, to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and voltage-gated N-type Ca2+ channels. We have demonstrated that activation of NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors in the recombinant cell lines inhibits the response to opioid agonists in two different paradigms involving Ca2+ signaling, thus reproducing the cellular anti-opioid activity observed with isolated neurons (12Roumy M. Zajac J. Brain Res. 1999; 845: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Roumy M. Garnier M. Zajac J.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 348: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, this cellular model, in contrast to those generally used (Chinese hamster ovary and COS), exhibits properties and gathers all protagonists of a neuronal cell, allowing a detailed molecular exploration of the opioid and anti-opioid signaling cross-talk that could have physiological significance. Using this model, we have accumulated data suggesting that classic cross-desensitization between both transduction systems does not occur. Indeed, NPFF and opioid receptors regulate similar effectors (adenylyl cyclase, voltage-gated N-type Ca2+ channel, and activated phospholipase C) and are coupled to essentially the same G-protein α subunits (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, only the pretreatment with NPFF agonists abolishes the opioid response, the reverse being not true (15Kersante F. Mollereau C. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Peptides. 2006; 27: 980-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This effect is not accompanied by a loss of opioid receptor binding affinity. Moreover, the antagonistic effect of 1DMe on the opioid-induced reduction of Ca2+ transients is not prevented by the addition of protein kinase A and C inhibitors (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results led us to consider that the anti-opioid activity of NPFF receptors could take place upstream from the signaling cascade, as the result of a physical interaction between NPFF and opioid receptors leading to non-functional complexes. Oligomerization of GPCR has been proposed to play a role in receptor biogenesis and recycling, pharmacological diversity, and regulation of signal transduction (17Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Terrillon S. Bouvier M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the pharmacological and signaling properties of heteromers differ from those of monomers and sometimes lead to inactive receptors as demonstrated for angiotensin receptors AT1 in AT1/AT2 heterodimers (19AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M. Quitterer U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39721-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) or somatostatin sst3 receptors in sst2A·sst3 complexes (20Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schroder H. Klutzny M. Kirscht S. Kreienkamp H.J. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14027-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In the present study, different cellular, biochemical, and biophysical approaches were used to investigate the possible heteromerization between NPFF2 and μ-opioid (MOP) receptors. Analysis of such an interaction in living cells has been greatly aided by the development of biological fluorescent probes derived from the native green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the jellyfish Aequora victoria, in association with biophysical and fluorescence spectroscopy techniques (21Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4983) Google Scholar). Therefore, SH-SY5Y cells were stably transfected with NPFF and MOP receptors tagged with the cyan (CFP) and yellow (YFP) fluorescent proteins, respectively, to investigate their possible interaction by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). FRET is a well suited technique to monitor protein-protein interactions or proximity in the 1-10 nm range in living cells and is appropriate for studying GPCR oligomerization (17Devi L.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 532-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 22Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 23Marshall F.H. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). FRAP has been extensively used to measure lateral diffusion of molecules in biological membranes (25Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) and has been applied to explore the confinement of GPCR in plasma membrane microdomains (26Cezanne L. Lecat S. Lagane B. Millot C. Vollmer J.Y. Matthes H. Galzi J.L. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45057-45067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Scott L. Zelenin S. Malmersjo S. Kowalewski J.M. Markus E.Z. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 762-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In FRAP experiments, a small area of the cell membrane is bleached with a brief pulse of a high intensity laser beam, and recovery of fluorescence into the bleached area is used to measure the membrane diffusion rate of the fluorescent molecule of interest. We used FRAP at variable observation radius (vrFRAP), which allows one to identify the presence of microdomains and to characterize their size (28Salome L. Cazeils J.L. Lopez A. Tocanne J.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Results presented in this study provide convincing evidence for a close proximity between NPFF2 and MOP receptors in the plasma membrane, which could be considered as heterodimerization. Interestingly, activation of NPFF receptors not only promotes receptor association, as visualized by FRET, but also modifies considerably the lateral mobility of MOP receptors in the plasma membrane by reducing the proportion of MOP receptors confined in microdomains. Upon activation, NPFF receptors could therefore move MOP receptors out of their signaling platform, preventing activation of their associated transduction systems, as well as their subsequent internalization. This hypothesis is proposed to explain the cellular anti-opioid activity of NPFF agonists. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (UK). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ozyme, France). Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was obtained from Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-MOP receptor antibody was a generous gift from Drs. Huda Akil and Stanley Watson (University of Michigan), but antibodies from Abcam (United Kingdom) were also tested. NPFF-related peptides were synthesized with an automated synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 433A). DAMGO (Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-NMe-Phe-gly-ol) was purchased from Bachem (France), and levorphanol was from Hoffmann Laroche (France). [3H]DAMGO (67 Ci/mmol) and [3H]adenine (26 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The NPFF2 receptor-selective radioligand [125I]EYF was iodinated by electrophilic substitution of EYFSLAAPQRFa (29Gouarderes C. Quelven I. Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Rice S.Q. Zajac J.M. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Radioiodinated peptides were stored at 4 °C in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, France). Vector Constructions—pcDNA3 plasmids containing the enhanced cyan (mCFP) and yellow (mYFP) monomeric variants (A206K mutation) of GFP (30Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Roger Y. Tsien (University of California). Because the stop codon was lacking in these constructions, a short adapter containing two TAA codons was obtained by annealing sense (5′-CTAAGGGTAAT-3′) and antisense (5′-CTAGATTACCCTTAGGTAC-3′) oligonucleotides. This adapter was then inserted at the 3′-end of each cDNA between KpnI and XbaI restriction sites of pcDNA3, which introduced three additional amino acids (Ala-Gly-Thr) at the C-terminal end of the proteins. cDNA were then transferred into pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene) using HindIII-XbaI sites for further cloning. We took advantage of the presence of an NcoI restriction site in the initiation codon to introduce the GFP cDNAs in-frame with the C-terminal end sequence of NPFF2 and MOP receptors. The human NPFF2 receptor (NPFF2) cDNA was obtained as previously reported (31Kotani M. Mollereau C. Detheux M. Le Poul E. Brezillon S. Vakili J. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Zajac J.M. Parmentier M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the human MOP receptor cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Laurent Emorine (Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Molé;culaire du Contrôle de la Prolifé;ration, Toulouse France). For the construction of NPFF2-CFP fusion protein, receptor cDNA was amplified by PCR with a forward primer containing a BamHI restriction site (5′-CGCGGATCCACCATGAATGAGAAATGGGAC-3′), and a reverse primer (5′-TACACCATGGCAGATTCAATCTCACTGCTGTTAGTAGTTTC-3′) designed to both suppress the stop codon and introduce a NcoI restriction site at the 3′-end of the sequence. This construction introduced three additional amino acids (Glu-Ser-Ala) at the C-terminal end of the receptor. The PCR product was ligated into PCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pBluesript II SK- using EcoRI. mCFP was ligated to the 3′-end of NPFF2 using NcoI and XbaI sites. The resulting construct contained residues Glu-Ser-Ala between the sequences of NPFF2 and mCFP. The construct was finally inserted into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEFIN3 bearing the neomycin selection marker (31Kotani M. Mollereau C. Detheux M. Le Poul E. Brezillon S. Vakili J. Mazarguil H. Vassart G. Zajac J.M. Parmentier M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For the construction of MOP-YFP fusion protein, receptor cDNA was amplified with a forward primer designed to replace the NcoI site present in the initiation codon by EcoRV (5′-TCGCGATATCATGGACAGCAGCGCTGCCC-3′) and a reverse primer designed to both suppress the stop codon and introduce NcoI and XbaI restriction sites at the 3′-end of the sequence (5′-TAGTTCTAGATTACACCATGGGACCCTGTAAG-3′). The PCR product was ligated to PCRT7/CT-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pBluescript II SK- using HindIII-XbaI. mYFP was ligated to the 3′-end of MOP receptor using NcoI and XbaI sites. The resulting construct contained residues Leu-Gln-Gly-Pro between the sequences of MOP receptor and mYFP. The completed construct was finally inserted into the EcoRV-XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pEFIB3 bearing the blasticidin selection marker. All constructs were verified by sequencing (Genome Express, France). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, kindly provided by Dr. F. Noble (Université; René; Descartes, Paris), were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (4.5 g/liter glucose, GlutaMAXI) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen), in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were used undifferentiated. Cells were transfected by using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Applied Science). Selection was achieved by adding to the culture medium 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for pEFIN3 constructs or 2 μg/ml blasticidin (Cayla, France) for pEFIB3 constructs, or both for double transfected cells. Individual clones were isolated by limit dilution in 96-well plates and grown for at least 6-8 weeks, because scattering strongly slowed down growth of neuroblastoma cells. After amplification, clones were characterized for their binding and functional properties. The NPFF2-CFP (clone B10) cell line was obtained first and then transfected with the MOP-YFP vector to obtain the double transfected cell line NPFF2-CFP/MOP-YFP (clone B8). The MOP-YFP vector was also used to transfect the SH2-D9 clone previously characterized (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to give the (SH2-D9)MOP-YFP (clone B7) cell line that expresses non-tagged NPFF2 receptors and YFP-tagged MOP receptors. Binding and Biological Assays—Membrane preparation, binding of [125I]EYF (NPFF2 receptors) or [3H]DAMGO (MOP receptors) and cAMP measurements were performed as previously described (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was monitored in living, perfused SH-SY5Y cells, by quantitative photometry using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—Cell membranes (300-350 μg), prepared as described previously (14Mollereau C. Mazarguil H. Zajac J.M. Roumy M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 965-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), were suspended and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation in freshly prepared solubilization buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with 25 μl of EZView red protein A affinity gel (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s. Immunoprecipitation was then performed with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads. The washing procedure was exactly as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma), boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting under standard conditions in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin. Immunoreactivity was revealed with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative FRET Imaging—Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well plates. The following day, cells were rinsed three times with KRH buffer (124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm HEPES, 8 mm glucose, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and then incubated for 5, 10, or 15 min at room temperature with 2 ml of buffer (control) or 2 ml of buffer plus 1 μm 1DMe or DAMGO. Cells were rinsed one time with KRH, one time with PBS, and were fixed with 3.8% formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with 2 ml of PBS, slides were mounted in PBS on CoverWell imaging chambers (Sigma). Images were captured with a Leica DM 5000B (Germany) upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a 100/1.4 oil immersion objective, a HBO mercury lamp and a cooled charge-coupled device camera (CoolSNAPES, Photometrics, Roper Scientific France). FRET measurements were performed under the “Sensitized FRET” configuration (32Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 33Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr.

J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) of the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Three images of the same field were successively collected at 5-s intervals through three series of filters (Omega Optical Inc.): 1) FRET (Ex: 440AF21; 455DRLP; Em: 535AF26), (2Panula P. Aarnisalo A.A. Wasowicz K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 48: 461-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) CFP (Ex: 440AF21; 455DRLP; Em: 480AF30), and 3) YFP (Ex: 500AF25; 525DRLP; Em: 545AF35). The integration time was 800 ms, without binning. Background correction was performed by subtracting an image of an empty field, acquired with the corresponding filter set under the same conditions. In each background-subtracted image, linear region of interest surrounding each cell were selected to quantify the mean fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane, using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). FRET values were corrected (FRETc) for the contribution of CFP and YFP emission in the FRET channel due to bleed-through of fluorophores, according to Equation 1, IFRETc+IFRET-(b×ICFP)-(a×IYFP)Eq. 1 where IFRET, ICFP, and IYFP, correspond to the mean fluorescence intensity of a given region of interest in the FRET, CFP, and YFP channels, respectively, and a and b are the ratio values IFRET/ICFP and IFRET/IYFP determined in cell lines expressing only CFP- or YFP-tagged receptors, respectively (32Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 33Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr.

J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). An illustration of the fluorophore contribution in wild-type and transfected cells is given in Fig. 4. Non-transfected SH-SY5Y cells displayed a moderate and non-homogeneous autofluorescence that was only detected in the CFP and FRET channels, giving an IFRET/ICFP ratio of 2 (Fig. 4). In CFP cells, the contribution of CFP bleed-through into the FRET channel was b = 0.67 ± 0.02 (3Zajac J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No fluorescence was detected at the acceptor excitation wavelength (Fig. 4). In YFP cells, the contribution of YFP fluorescence in the FRET channel was a = 0.54 ± 0.02 (3Zajac J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calculated with FRET intensity values corrected for the autofluorescence contamination (twice the intensity recorded in the CFP channel). Because fluorescence intensity varied among cells, results were expressed as normalized FRET: FRETN = IFRETc/(ICFP × IYFP)½ (34Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Confocal Imaging—Cells seeded on glass coverslips were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μm agonist, after a 30-min preincubation in KRH buffer or KRH buffer containing 5 μm 1DMe. After fixation, the cells were mounted in Vectashield medium (AbCys, France) and observed on an upright laser scanner confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Germany) with a 40/1 oil immersion objective. The excitation wavelength was 514 nm, and images were acquired without frame average or frame accumulation, with a zoom of 2.97. vrFRAP Experiments on Living Cells—(SH2-D9)MOP-YFP cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates for 36 h. Each coverslip was washed with 3 ml of KRH buffer, placed on a homemade stainless steel slide, and left for 5 min at room temperature with 500 μl of KRH buffer (control) or 500 μl of KRH buffer containing 1 μm 1DMe. Cells were then covered with another coverslip and observed for 30-40 min at room temperature (20-22 °C). A detailed description of the conditions for FRAP experiments with variable observation radius (vrFRAP) has been previously reported (26Cezanne L. Lecat S. Lagane B. Millot C. Vollmer J.Y. Matthes H. Galzi J.L. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45057-45067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The vrFRAP work station consisted of an upright Leitz Ortholux II fluorescence microscope coupled to a photomultiplier detection system and equipped with a 63/1.3 oil immersion objective combined to a set of diaphragms allowing the diameter of the observed field to vary between 1.4 and 3.45 μm. The cell membrane was illuminated with an argon laser beam (λex = 488 nm), and the fluorescence was recorded over a period of 30 s, including3sof acquisition before bleaching. Shutter and laser settings were adjusted to prevent photobleaching during recording and to obtain a 40-60% bleaching rate during the 20- to 40-ms bleaching time. For a given observation radius, the measurements were repeated in at least 30 cells. No variation in cell responses was observed over the 30-40 min of observation. Fluorescence recovery curves were analyzed by fitting experimental data to a mathematical model of diffusion (35Lopez A. Dupou L. Altibelli A. Trotard J. Tocanne J.F. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 963-970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with a customized minimization algorithm. The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) and the mobile fraction (M) corresponding to the fluorescent molecules that can diffuse through the bleached area (25Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E.

https://openalex.org/W2009546865,"Worldwide, 400 million people suffer from hay fever and seasonal asthma. The major causative agents of these allergies are pollen specific proteins called the group-1 grass pollen allergens. Although details of their antigenicity have been studied for 40 years with an eye towards immunotherapy, their function in the plant has drawn scant attention. Zea m 1 constitutes a class of abundant grass pollen allergens coded for by several genes that loosen the walls of grass cells, including the maize stigma and style. We have examined the impact of a transposon insertion into one of these genes (EXPB1, the most abundant isoform of Zea m 1) on the production of Zea m 1 protein, pollen viability, and pollen tube growth, both in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the effect of the insertional mutation on the competitive ability of the pollen by experimentally varying the sizes of the pollen load deposited onto stigmas using pollen from heterozygous plants and then screening the progeny for the presence of the transposon using PCR. We found that the insertional mutation reduced the levels of Zea m 1 in maize pollen, but had no effect on pollen viability, in vitro pollen tube growth or the proportion of progeny sired when small pollen loads are deposited onto stigmas. However, when large pollen loads are deposited onto the stigmas, the transposon mutation is vastly underrepresented in the progeny, indicating that this major pollen allergen has a large effect on pollen tube growth rates in vivo, and plays an important role in determining the outcome of the pollen-pollen competition for access to the ovules. We propose that the extraordinary abundance (4% of the extractable protein in maize pollen) of this major pollen allergen is the result of selection for a trait that functions primarily in providing differential access to ovules."
https://openalex.org/W2007161298,"Preparatory to a community trial investigating how best to deliver rectal artesunate as pre-referral treatment for severe malaria; local understanding, perceptions of signs/symptoms of severe malaria and treatment-seeking patterns for and barriers to seeking biomedical treatment were investigated.19 key informant interviews, 12 in-depth interviews and 14 focus group discussions targeting care-givers, opinion leaders, and formal and informal health care providers were conducted. Monthly fever episodes and danger signs or symptoms associated with severe malaria among under-fives were recorded. Respondents recognized convulsions, altered consciousness and coma, and were aware of their risks if not treated. But, these symptoms were perceived to be caused by supernatural forces, and traditional healers were identified as primary care providers. With some delay, mothers eventually visited a health facility when convulsions were part of the illness, despite pressures against this. Although vomiting and failure to eat/suck/drink were associated with malaria, they were not considered as indicators of danger signs unless combined with another more severe symptom. Study communities were familiar with rectal application of medicines.Communities' recognition and awareness of major symptoms of severe malaria could encourage action, but perceptions of their causes and poor discrimination of other danger signs - vomiting and failure to feed - might impede early treatment. An effective health education targeting parents/guardians, decision-makers/advisors, and formal and informal care providers might be a prerequisite for successful introduction of rectal artemisinins as an emergency treatment. Role of traditional healers in delivering such medication to the community should be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2074639088,"As an intermediate filament (IF)-based cytolinker protein, plectin plays a key role in the maintenance of cellular cytoarchitecture and serves at the same time as a scaffolding platform for signaling cascades. Consisting of six structural repeats (R1-6) and harboring binding sites for different IF proteins and proteins involved in signaling, the plectin C-terminal domain is of strategic functional importance. Depending on the species, it contains at least 13 cysteines, 4 of which reside in the R5 domain. To investigate the structural and biological functions of R5 cysteines, we used cysteine-to-serine mutagenesis and spectroscopic, biochemical, and functional analyses. Urea-induced unfolding experiments indicated that wild-type R5 in the oxidized, disulfide bond-mediated conformation was more stable than its cysteine-free mutant derivative. The binding affinity of R5 for vimentin was significantly higher, however, when the protein was in the reduced, more relaxed conformation. Of the four R5 cysteines, one (Cys4) was particularly reactive as reflected by its ability to form disulfide bridges with R5 Cys1 and to serve as a target for nitrosylation in vitro. Using immortalized endothelial cell cultures from mice, we show that endogenous plectin is nitrosylated in vivo, and we found that NO donor-induced IF collapse proceeds dramatically faster in plectin-deficient compared with wild-type cells. Our data suggest an antagonistic role of plectin in nitrosylation (oxidative stress)-mediated alterations of IF cytoarchitecture and a possible role of R5 Cys4 as a regulatory switch."
https://openalex.org/W2076722432,"Increasing evidence implicates cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in neuronal synaptic function. We searched for Cdk5 substrates in synaptosomal fractions prepared from mouse brains. Mass spectrometric analysis after two-dimensional SDS-PAGE identified several synaptic proteins phosphorylated by Cdk5-p35; one protein identified was Sept5 (CDCrel-1). Although septins were isolated originally as cell division-related proteins in yeast, Sept5 is expressed predominantly in neurons and is implicated in exocytosis. We confirmed that Sept5 is phosphorylated by Cdk5-p35 in vitro and identified Ser17 of adult type Sept5 (Sept5_v1) as a major phosphorylation site. We found that Ser17 of Sept5_v1 is phosphorylated in mouse brains. Coimmunoprecipitation from synaptosomal fractions and glutathione S-transferase-syntaxin-1A pulldown assays of Sept5_v1 expressed in COS-7 cells showed that phosphorylation of Sept5_v1 by Cdk5-p35 decreases the binding to syntaxin-1.

However, the precise function of Cdk5-p35 in synaptic activity has not been elucidated fully.Sept5 (also known as CDCrel-1) is a member of the septin family of cytoplasmic 40–60-kDa proteins comprising a highly conserved GTPase motif at the N terminus and a coiled-coil domain at the C terminus. Septins were first discovered in mutants of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that cannot complete cell division (22Hartwell L.H. Culotti J. Pringle J.R. Reid B.J. Science. 1974; 183: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Yeast septins form hetero-oligomeric filaments that contribute to bud site selection and neck stability (23Byers B. Goetsch L.

Science. 2005; 307: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Mammalian septins are involved in many other cellular activities including membrane dynamics, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal remodeling (28Kartmann B. Roth D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 839-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gottfried Y. Rotem A. Lotan R. Steller H. Larisch S.

Several septins are also expressed in postmitotic neurons. Sept5 is expressed predominantly in neurons; localizes in presynaptic regions; interacts with syntaxin-1A, a component of the SNARE complex; and regulates neurotransmitter release (31Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 32Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Sept5 is thought to inhibit exocytosis by acting as a physical barrier, as shown by the observation that overexpression of Sept5 in HIT-T15 cells inhibits evoked human growth hormone secretion (32Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Prolonged overexpression induces neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat brain (33Dong Z. Ferger B. Paterna J.C. Vogel D. Furler S. Osinde M. Feldon J. Bueler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12438-12443Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Sept5 is a substrate for parkin, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, whose mutation is a cause of autosomal recessive familial Parkinson disease (34Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Thus, proper regulation of Sept5 is important for neuronal function and survival. However, the regulation of the functions of Sept5 is not understood at all.We identified adult type Sept5 (Sept5_v1) as a Cdk5 substrate in the synaptosomal fractions using the combined methods of two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometric analysis. We found Ser17 of Sept5_v1 at a phosphorylation site in vitro and in vivo and found that phosphorylation of Sept5_v1 at Ser17 decreases the binding to syntaxin-1. We hypothesize that Cdk5 modulates synaptic vesicle release by regulating the interaction between Sept5 and syntaxin-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Antibodies against CDCrel-1 (C-20), Cdk5 (DC17), p35 (C-19), and Myc tag (9E10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-human CDCrel-1 (C354) antibody was purchased from MBL (Nagoya, Japan). Anti-dynamin (Clone 41) antibody was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2A (NMDAR2A) antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Antibodies to syntaxin-1 (6D2, 10H5), SNAP-25 (BRO8), and VAMP-2 (3D10) were described previously (35Yoshida A. Oho C. Omori A. Kuwahara R. Ito T. Takahashi M. J. Biol.

Anti-Ser(P)17 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with the synthetic phosphopeptide of EWLLpSPRTQAC (AnyGen, Kwang-ju, Korea) and was affinity-purified using the peptide conjugated to Sepharose beads using SulfoLink (Pierce) to produce the negative nonphosphorylated peptide and positive phosphorylated peptide.Plasmids—Myc adult type mouse Sept5 (Sept5_v1) was provided by Dr. Ted M. Dawson (The Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) (34Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). cDNA of Sept5_v2 or Sept5_v1 excised with KpnI and NotI was cloned into a pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Ala (S17A), Asp (S17D), and Glu (S17E) mutants of Ser17 in Sept5_v1 were generated by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pcDNA3-Sept5_v1 as a template according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Preparation of Synaptosomal Proteins from Mouse Brains—Subcellular fractionation and preparation of synaptosomes were performed as described previously with some modifications (37Ueda T. Greengard P. Berzins K. Cohen R.S. Blomberg F. Grab D.J. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In brief, 12–15-week-old C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The brains were homogenized with a Teflon pestle glass homogenizer in 10 volumes of HEPES buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 μg/mg leupeptin, and 1 μm E64) containing 0.32 m sucrose. The homogenate (H) was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (S1) was centrifuged again at 8,500 × g for 15 min. The pellet (P2) was suspended in HEPES buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose and centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 15 min to yield the supernatant (S2′) and pellet (P2′). The P2′ pellet was homogenized in HEPES buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose with a Teflon pestle glass homogenizer. The homogenate was layered on top of a 1.2 and 0.8 m stepwise sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h using an SPR28-SA rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Synaptosomes sedimented to the 0.8–1.2 m sucrose interface as a broad band with high turbidity.To separate the detergent-soluble and -insoluble proteins, the synaptosomal proteins were suspended in MOPS buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC, 1 μg/mg leupeptin, and 1 μm E64) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. All of the procedures were performed at 4 °C throughout the preparation.In Vitro Phosphorylation of Synaptosomal Proteins by Cdk5-p35—Cdk5-p35-His was purified from the extract of Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus encoding Cdk5 and p35-His as described previously (38Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Synaptosomal proteins were phosphorylated by Cdk5-p35 in MOPS buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 35 °C. The reaction was stopped by cooling on ice, and the detergent-soluble supernatant and detergent-insoluble pellet fractions were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional PAGE, and the radioactivity was detected by a BAS2000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan).Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Protein spots were stained by ProteoSilver Plus silver stain kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and excised from the two-dimensional PAGE gel. After washing, the gels were digested by incubation in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, with trypsin (39Taoka M. Ichimura T. Wakamiya-Tsuruta A. Kubota Y. Araki T. Obinata T. Isobe T. J. Biol.

Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Preparation of Cell Extracts, and Immunoprecipitation for Phosphorylation—COS-7 cells cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (KOHJIN BIO, Saitama, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH, Lenexa, KS) were transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-Sept5 using a PolyFect transfection regent (Qiagen). The cells were harvested 24 h after transfection. Myc-Sept5 was prepared from COS-7 cell extracts in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μm E64) by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody using protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare BioScience, Piscataway, NJ). Sept5 was also prepared from synaptosomes in RIPA buffer by immunoprecipitation with anti-Sept5 antibody using protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Science). The beads were washed with RIPA buffer four times and with MOPS buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 four times, and the immunoprecipitated Sept5 was phosphorylated in the presence of 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP by Cdk5-p35.Coimmunoprecipitation of Syntaxin-1 with Sept5 from Synaptosomes—The synaptosomes in MOPS buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm NaCl were incubated with anti-Sept5 for 1 h at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with MOPS buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm NaCl, and the binding of syntaxin-1 with Sept5 was examined by immunoblotting.GST-Syntaxin-1A Pulldown Assay—GST-syntaxin-1A was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified from the cell extract by glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Science). The extracts of COS-7 cells expressing Sept5_v1, either WT, S17A, S17D, or S17E, with or without Cdk5-p35, were incubated with GST-syntaxin-1A immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with MOPS buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 100 mm NaCl, and the bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.SDS-PAGE, Two-dimensional PAGE, and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (38Sakaue F. Saito T. Sato Y. Asada A. Ishiguro K. Hasegawa M. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31522-31529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional PAGE was carried out using a horizontal electrophoresis system NA-1410-R (Nihon Eido, Tokyo, Japan). The Immobiline Dry-strip (pH 3–10, 24 cm long; GE Healthcare Bio-Science) was rehydrated using a cellular and organelle membrane solubilizing reagent (Sigma) containing synaptosomal proteins for 18 h at 25 °C. The first dimension was isoelectric focusing, and the second dimension was SDS-PAGE.RESULTSSubcellular Fractionation of Cdk5-p35 in Synaptosomes of Mouse Brains—Synaptosomes were prepared from mouse brains by the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Successful fractionation of synaptosomes was confirmed by the enrichment of synaptic proteins such as VAMP-2, dynamin 1, and NR2A (Fig. 1A). Both Cdk5 and p35 were detected in the isolated synaptosomal fractions, as reported previously (Fig. 1A) (13Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 731-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). p35 was more concentrated in synaptosomes than was Cdk5, which was distributed more evenly in other fractions. Synaptosomal proteins were separated further into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by centrifugation in the presence of Nonidet P-40. Consistent with previous observations, presynaptic proteins (e.g. VAMP-2) were enriched in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, and the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction contained the postsynaptic density proteins (e.g. NR2A) and detergent-resistant membrane components and cytoskeletal proteins. Dynamin 1 was enriched into the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1B). More Cdk5 and p35 was found in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction than in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, implicating the presence of more substrate proteins in the detergent-resistant membranes, cytoskeletons, or postsynaptic density (42Gil C.

Synaptosomal proteins were separated into Nonidet P-40-soluble and Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography. The addition of Cdk5-p35 increased phosphorylation significantly (Fig. 2A, right panel).

We confirmed the fractionation of Sept5 in our synaptosomal fraction by immunoblotting with anti-Sept5 antibody. Sept5 was distributed widely from the S1 to P2′ fractions in the subcellular preparation and was recovered in the synaptosomal fraction when the crude synaptosomes (P2′) were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 4A). In synaptosomes treated with Nonidet P-40, Sept5 was found in both Nonidet P-40-insoluble and Nonidet P-40-soluble fractions (Fig. 4B). Further, when the region around spot 4 in two-dimensional PAGE was immunoblotted with anti-Sept5, the reaction was detected at spot 4 with additional spots of several different isoelectric points and two distinct electrophoretic mobilities (data not shown).FIGURE 4Phosphorylation of Sept5_v1 at Ser17 by Cdk5-p35 in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W2164919206,"Differences in the ways in which males and females maximize evolutionary fitness can lead to intra-locus sexual conflict in which genes delivering fitness benefits to one sex are costly when expressed in the other. Trade-offs between current reproductive effort and future reproduction and survival are fundamental to the evolutionary biology of ageing. This leads to the prediction that sex differences in the optimization of age-dependent reproductive effort may generate intra-locus sexual conflict over ageing rates. Here we test for intra-locus sexual conflict over age-dependent reproductive effort and longevity in the black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus. Using a half-sib breeding design, we show that the most important components of male and female reproductive effort (male calling effort and the number of eggs laid by females) were positively genetically correlated, especially in early adulthood. However, the genetic relationships between longevity and reproductive effort were different for males and females, leading to low genetic covariation between male and female longevity. The apparent absence of intra-locus sexual conflict over ageing suggests that male and female longevity can evolve largely independently of one another."

In response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged murine Mtss1 (Mtss1-GFP) underwent redistribution from the cytoplasm to dorsal membrane ruffles along with phosphorylation at tyrosine residues in a time-dependent manner. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1-GFP was also elevated in cells where an oncogenic Src was activated but severely impaired in Src knock-out cells or cells treated with Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Mutagenesis analysis has revealed that phosphorylation occurs at multiple sites, including tyrosine residues Tyr-397 and Tyr-398. Mutation at both Tyr-397 and Tyr-398 abolished the PDGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, recombinant Mtss1 protein was phosphorylated by recombinant Src in a manner dependent on Tyr-397 and Tyr-398. Efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1 in response to PDGF also involves a coiled-coil domain, which is essential for a proper distribution to the cell leading edge and dorsal ruffles. Interestingly, overexpression of wild type Mtss1-GFP promoted the PDGF-induced dorsal ruffling, whereas overexpression of a mutant deficient in phosphorylation at Tyr-397 and Tyr-398 or a mutant with deletion of the coiled-coil domain impaired the formation of dorsal ruffles.

Growth factor-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization plays a pivotal role in cell shape changes, locomotion, endocytosis, and homeostasis. The signal transduction elicited by ligand-occupied receptors initially involves activation of several small guanosine triphosphatase proteins, including Rac, Cdc42, and Rho (1Nobes C.D. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). Activated Cdc42 or Rac binds either directly or indirectly to Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP) 2The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein; CCD, coiled-coil domain; GFP, green fluorescence protein; IMD, IRSp53 and Mtss1 homology domain; IRSp53, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate p53; MIM/Mtss1, missing in metastasis protein; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; WAVE, WASP family verprolin homologous protein; WH2, WASP homology 2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; GST, glutathione S-transferase; KD, kinase-dead. or WASP family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE/Scar), resulting in recruitment of these proteins to the plasma membrane wherein they subsequently activate Arp2/3 complex, an actin nucleation factor for the branched actin filaments that constitute lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (2Stradal T.E. Scita G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). On the other hand, activation of Rho promotes the assembly of non-branched actin filaments through the function of the Formin family proteins, which may be responsible for the formation of stress fibers or actin cables (3Dong Y. Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to these relatively well established signaling factors, there are a few actin-associated proteins the role of which in the cytoskeletal reorganization remains to be defined. One of these proteins is MIM, which stands for missing in metastasis, or MTSS1 as recently recommended by Human Genome Organization Gene Nomenclature Committee. Previous studies have reported the existence of multiple MIM splicing transcripts, including MIM-A, the prototype of MIM that encodes only 356 amino acids; MIM-B, which encodes a protein product of 759 amino acids; and MIM-C, which contains an alternative exon and predicts a protein of 734 amino acids (4Wang Y. Liu J. Smith E. Zhou K. Liao J. Yu G.Y. Zhan X. Cancer Investig. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). However, analysis of a variety of human cells revealed only a dominant MIM-related immuno-reactivity running at a position close to recombinant MIM-B (4Wang Y. Liu J. Smith E. Zhou K. Liao J. Yu G.Y. Zhan X. Cancer Investig. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar), indicating that MIM-B likely represents the primary protein product of MIM. We hereby designate MTSS1 as the human gene that encodes a protein product with the same amino acid sequence as MIM-B, which bears a carboxyl-terminal WASP homology 2 (WH2) domain that is known to bind to monomeric actin (5Mattila P.K.

Neoplasia. 2002; 4: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a serine-rich domain (SRD), and a proline-rich domain (PRD) (Fig. 1A). The protein product of MTSS1 is structurally related to insulin receptor substrate protein 53 (IRSp53), a multidomain scaffolding protein that has been implicated in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia (7Yamagishi A.

The sequence similarity between MTSS1 and IRSp53 centers on the amino-terminal region of 250 amino acids, which is also called IRSp53 and MTSS1 homology domain (IMD) (Fig. 1A). Structural and biochemical analyses have demonstrated that IMD of IRSp53 is composed of four α helices that integrate each other and form an apparent anti-parallel homodimer (10Millard T.H.

Expression of MTSS1 has been found to be down-regulated in a subset of tumor cells derived from advanced prostate, breast, bladder, and gastric cancers (6Lee Y.G. Macoska J.A. Korenchuk S.

The mechanism for the down-regulation of MTSS1 may involve DNA methylation (13Yamashita S. Tsujino Y. Moriguchi K. Tatematsu M. Ushijima T.

Although the relevance of such down-regulation to tumor progression, in particular, metastasis, has not yet been confirmed, several lines of evidence have indicated a role of MTSS1 in cell morphogenesis. Overexpression of MTSS1 triggers distinct cell shape changes such as increase in the formation of lamellipodia, membrane ruffles, and filopodia-like structures (5Mattila P.K. Salminen M. Yamashiro T.

Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More interestingly, MTSS1 has been found to be a target of Sonic hedgehog, a well characterized morphogen that plays a critical role in the patterning of embryonic and adult tissues (18Callahan C.A. Ofstad T. Horng L. Wang J.K. Zhen H.H. Coulombe P.A. Oro A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2724-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, how MTSS1 induces these changes is not understood. MTSS1 has been proposed to be a scaffolding protein by linking F-actin to other intracellular proteins, including Rac1 (16Bompard G. Sharp S.J. Freiss G. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5393-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and δ type receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (15Woodings J.A. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem.

On the other hand, the potential of MTSS1 to act as a signaling protein has also been evidenced. In skin epithelial cells, MTSS1 was found to associate with Gli, a major signaling target of the Sonic hedgehog pathway, and activate the transcriptional activity of Gli within cells (18Callahan C.A. Ofstad T. Horng L. Wang J.K. Zhen H.H. Coulombe P.A. Oro A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2724-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that Mtss1, a murine protein sharing 96.3% identity with MTSS1, binds to cortactin through the proline-rich domain and promotes the cortactin-mediated actin assembly (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Mtss1 inhibits the actin polymerization mediated by a spontaneous process or by neuronal (N)-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Mtss1 caused a reduction in the motility of NIH3T3 cells in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and of human endothelial cells in response to sphingosine 1 phosphate (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although these results have indicated that Mtss1 may modulate cell morphogenesis through regulation of the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli, the link between Mtss1 and growth factor receptor signaling pathways is unknown. In the present study we attempted to explore the role of Mtss1 in the PDGF signaling pathway and found that PDGF rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ectopically expressed Mtss1 and redistribution of Mtss1 to dorsal membrane ruffles and the cell leading edge. We also identified two major phosphotyrosine sites targeted by protein tyrosine kinase Src. Overexpression of a mutant at these two tyrosine residues apparently reduced dorsal membrane ruffling mediated by PDGF. Thus, our data suggest that Mtss1 is implicated in a growth factor receptor signaling pathway that regulates cell shape changes via protein tyrosine kinases.

Src in Vitro Kinase Assay—Purified recombinant Mtss1 or its derivatives (3 μg) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 0.25 mm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 10 units of recombinant Src. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. The sample was further analyzed by phosphotyrosine immunoblot using 4G10 antibody. Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded onto coverslips precoated with fibronectin in a 6-well plate. The cells on coverslips were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS plus 5% goat serum) for 1 h, followed by incubation in blocking buffer containing primary antibody for 1 h. The cell samples were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-rabbit antibody and Pacific Blue-coupled anti-mouse antibody. After three times of wash, the samples were mounted onto glass slides using Prolong Anti-fade kit and subsequently inspected under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon TE2000U) using a ×60 oil lens. Cell images were captured by digital camera Nikon 1200F and further processed by Adobe Photoshop. Protein Profile Scan—Murine Mtss1 amino acid sequence was examined for the presence of structural motifs using the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. PDGF Induces Redistribution and Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Mtss1-GFP—To study a potential role of Mtss1 in growth factor signal transductions, we analyzed NIH3T3 cells expressing murine Mtss1 that had been fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at its C terminus (Mtss1-GFP). Expression of Mtss1-GFP was driven by retroviral vector MGIN (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent analysis revealed a diffused staining of Mtss1-GFP in the cytoplasm when cells were grown in a low percent serum-containing medium (Fig. 1B, a). Upon stimulation with PDGF, Mtss1-GFP was translocated within 5 min into a membrane wave-like structure wherein cortactin (blue) and F-actin (red) were also enriched (Fig. 1B, d-f). A similar cortactin-enriched wave structure has also been previously described in PDGF-treated NIH3T3 cells (21Krueger E.W. Orth J.D. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Time-lapse image analysis showed that these waves were highly dynamic (data not shown), indicating that they likely represent a type of membrane dynamics that has been previously described as dorsal ruffles where actin polymerization is intimately implicated (22Mellstrom K. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to these dorsal ruffles, Mtss1-GFP was also found in the cell leading edge that outlines the newly formed lamellipodia (Fig. 1B, h). This finding is consistent with the role of Mtss1 in actin polymerization as previously reported (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, either in quiescent or PDGF-treated cells Mtss1-GFP did not apparently associate with stress fibers or filopodia, indicating that Mtss1 preferably binds to the cortactin-associated actin network. To study in detail about the role of Mtss1 in the PDGF signaling pathway, we examined the possibility that Mtss1 may be subjected to tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PDGF, as many phosphotyrosyl proteins are known to engage in the signal transduction of PDGF receptors (23Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, phosphotyrosine immunoblot was carried out to analyze Mtss1-GFP in NIH3T3 cells before and after PDGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 1C, Mtss1-GFP underwent a rapid phosphorylation upon PDGF treatment, which reached to a peak within 1 min but started to decline at 10 min and retreated to the basal level after 1 h. These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1 represents an early event in the PDGF signaling cascade. Determination of Phosphotyrosine Residues of Mtss1—The predicted full-length Mtss1 protein contains a total of 15 tyrosine residues. To define specific residues responsible for the PDGF-induced phosphorylation, we prepared a series of GFP-tagged Mtss1 mutants in which individual tyrosine residues were substituted with phenylalanine and transfected each mutant into NIH3T3 cells. Transient transfectants were subjected to tyrosine phosphorylation analysis by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, mutations at individual residues of Tyr-177, Tyr-256, Tyr-260, Tyr-394, Tyr-422, Tyr-509, Tyr-532, and Tyr-562 caused only little or minor effect on the PDGF-mediated phosphorylation. However, mutants Y397F and Y398F showed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation response to PDGF by more than 60% as compared with the wild type Mtss1-GFP. Furthermore, double mutations at Tyr-397 and Tyr-398 nearly abolished the phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), indicating that these two residues play a critical role in the PDGF-mediated phosphorylation. In contrast, mutants carrying either double mutations of Y256F/Y260F or sextuple mutations of Y177F/Y256F/Y260F/Y394F/Y422F/Y532F (Mtss1-YF6) were still effectively phosphorylated at a level similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 2B). To analyze the role of the remaining tyrosine residues, we introduced an additional mutation at each of these residues as well as Tyr-397 and Tyr-398 to the mutant Mtss1-YF6. As shown in Fig. 2C, addition of Y27F, Y130F, Y303F, and Y305F to Mtss1-YF6, respectively, resulted in little change in the PDGF-induced phosphorylation. In contrast, adding Y397F or Y398F or Y530F impaired significantly the phosphorylation of Mtss1-YF6. However, PDGF was able to induce phosphorylation of a mutant carrying Tyr-530 alone (data not shown), indicating that Tyr-530, unlike Tyr-397 and Tyr-98, may only play a role in the phosphorylation in certain contexts such as mutant YF6. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Mtss1 Is Mainly Mediated by Src—Protein tyrosine kinase Src is known to play an important role in PDGF signal transduction as well as cytoskeletal reorganization (24Twamley-Stain G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 7696-7700Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 26Wang D. Tan Y.C. Kreitzer G.E. Nakai Y. Shan D. Zheng Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 32660-32667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of Src in Mtss1 phosphorylation, NIH3T3 cells expressing Mtss1-GFP were exposed to a selective Src inhibitor, PP2, prior to PDGF treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, PP2 treatment completely abolished Mtss1 phosphorylation. In contrast, when cells were treated with emodin, a less selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, only partial inhibition was observed (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1-GFP was further investigated in embryonic fibroblasts derived from Src knock-out mice (Src-/-) and those derived from normal MEFs. As shown in Fig. 3B, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1-GFP in Src-/- cells was significantly less than that of MEF. The remaining phosphorylation detected in Src-/- could be caused by the activity of other Src family members, which include Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Fgr, Hck, Blk and Lck. Thus, we also analyzed embryonic fibroblasts derived from triple knock-out mice at Src, Yes, and Fyn (SYF) and NIH3T3 cells expressing a KD Fgr mutant. Whereas a trace amount of phosphorylated Mtss1-GFP was still observed in PDGF-treated SYF cells (Fig. 3C), markedly reduced phosphorylation was evident in Fgr-KD cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the level of Mtss1-GFP phosphorylation was significantly elevated in cells overexpressing a wild type Fgr (Fgr-WT) even in the absence of PDGF (Fig. 3D), indicating that the activity of Fgr or other closely related kinases contributes to Mtss1-GFP phosphorylation as well. We also examined the role of Syk, a non-Src-related intracellular tyrosine kinase. However, expression of either wild type Syk or a Syk-KD mutant failed to show any significant effect on the phosphorylation of Mtss1-GFP (data not shown), indicating that Src family kinases play a primary role in the phosphorylation of Mtss1 mediated by PDGF. To determine whether Mtss1 acts as a direct substrate of Src, we prepared recombinant Mtss1 proteins tagged by six histidine residues (His6) at the carboxyl terminus (Mtss1-His). Purified Mtss1-His, which was detected as multiple protein species on SDS-PAGE as a result of partial degradation (Fig. 4A), was incubated with recombinant Src kinase at 30 °C in the presence of ATP. To ensure an optimal condition used for Src, recombinant cortactin, a well characterized prominent substrate of Src (27Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), was also analyzed in parallel. Under this condition, both cortactin and Mtss1-His were readily phosphorylated as determined by phosphotyrosine immunoblot. Under the same condition, only a very faint band corresponding to GST was noticed in the phosphotyrosine immunoblot. Because the amount of GST used in this reaction was significantly higher than the rest of the samples (Fig. 4A), such a faint band likely represented a nonspecific reactivity of the phosphotyrosine antibody. To determine whether Src targets at Tyr-397 and Tyr-398, we also prepared a GST-tagged Mtss1 fragment corresponding to amino acids 382-420 (GST-Mtss1382-420) and its derivatives, GST-Mtss1382-420Y394F, GST-Mtss1382-420Y397F, and GST-Mtss1382-420Y398F. Although GST-Mtss1382-420 was readily phosphorylated by Src (Fig. 4B), significantly lower levels of phosphorylation were observed with mutants GST-Mtss1382-420Y397F and GST-Mtss1382-420Y398F, confirming that Tyr-397 and Tyr-398 are the direct targets of Src. A slightly reduced level of phosphorylation was also found with mutant GST-Mtss1382-420Y394F, suggesting a minor role of Tyr-394 in the phosphorylation of Mtss1 in vitro. To examine whether Src could trigger phosphorylation of endogenous Mtss1, we used murine mammary tumor 4T07 cells, in which Mtss1 is highly expressed (4Wang Y. Liu J. Smith E. Zhou K. Liao J. Yu G.Y. Zhan X. Cancer Investig. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar). 4T07 cells were infected with a retrovirus encoding ts-v-Src, a temperature-sensitive form of Src oncogene (28Catling A.D. Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. Haefner B. Wyke J.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4392-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Mtss1 was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with Mtss1 followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblot. Consistent with our previous report and others (16Bompard G. Sharp S.J. Freiss G. Machesky L.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5393-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Gonzalez-Quevedo R. Shoffer M. Horng L. Oro A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), endogenous Mtss1 is resolved as two bands, with the major one at a position near 115 kDa (Fig. 4C, right panel). At the permissive temperature 35 °C, phosphorylation of Mtss1 corresponding to 115 kDa was readily detected. On the other hand, no phosphorylation was observed at the restrictive temperature 39.5 °C (left panel), a condition that had no apparent effect on the expression of Mtss1 (right panel). Thus, these data demonstrated that Mtss1, either as an exogenous or endogenous form, functions as an appropriate substrate of Src. The Coiled-coil Domain Is Required for PDGF-mediated Phosphorylation—Computer analysis has revealed that Mtss1 contains a coiled-coil domain (CCD) from amino acids 108 to 153 (Fig. 1A), which corresponds to the second α-helix of IRSp53's IMD within the interface of homodimer as indicated by a recent crystallography study (10Millard T.H. Bompard G. Heung M.Y. Dafforn T.R. Scott D.J. Machesky L.M. Futterer K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To analyze whether CCD plays any functional role, we prepared Mtss1ΔCCD-GFP and analyzed the distribution of the mutant in NIH3T3 cells upon PDGF treatment. Unlike wild type Mtss1-GFP, the mutant was diffused within the cytoplasm without evident translocation into membrane ruffles or the cell leading edge after PDGF treatment (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the mutant was also poorly phosphorylated in response to PDGF (Fig. 5B), indicating that CCD is requisite for both tyrosine phosphorylation and distribution of Mtss1 to certain cellular areas where actin polymerization actively takes place. Mtss1 Promotes PDGF-induced Dorsal Membrane Ruffling in a Tyrosine Phosphorylation-dependent Manner—To explore the physiological significance of Mtss1 phosphorylation, we examined NIH3T3 cells infected with retrovirus encoding Mtss1Y397F/Y398F-GFP. The mutant-expressing cells did not show a significant difference in morphology as compared with the wild type. Furthermore, the mutant retained the ability to translocate into the punctate structures in the cytoplasm and the cell leading edge upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 5A). However, these cells did not establish dorsal membrane ruffles in response to PDGF as efficiently as the cells expressing Mtss1-GFP (Fig. 6A, e and f). To quantify dorsal ruffling, we measured the ruffling area of each cell at 5 min after stimulation, the time at which extensive dorsal ruffling activity was observed. This analysis indicated that dorsal ruffles on the control cells expressing GFP only had an average ruffling area of ∼24 μm2, whereas the cells expressing Mtss1-GFP had an average ruffle area of ∼50 μm2 (Fig. 6B). Further exposure to PDGF for 15 min did not significantly increase ruffle formation (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the average ruffling area on the cells expressing Mtss1Y397F/Y398F-GFP was ∼15 μm2 at 5 min, which is statistically lower than that of the cells expressing Mtss1-GFP or the control cells expressing GFP only (Fig. 6B). At 15 min, however, the average ruffling area reached to 22 μm2, which was similar to that of control cells but still significantly lower than that of the cells expressing wild type Mtss1. A similar conclusion was obtained when the dorsal ruffling was measured based on the percentage of cells that had developed significant dorsal ruffles (data not shown). We also examined dorsal ruffle formation in cells expressing Mtss1ΔCCD-GFP. These cells poorly responded to PDGF for morphological changes and developed dorsal ruffles with an average area of only 17 μm2 at 5 min and 20 μm2 at 15 min (Fig. 6A, g and h, and Fig. 6B). Therefore, Mtss1-mediated dorsal ruffling requires both tyrosine phosphorylation and the function of the CCD motif. Human MTSS1 gene has recently drawn much attention as it encodes an actin-associated protein that is frequently down-regulated in a variety of cancers. However, it is unclear whether MTSS1 acts as only a scaffolding protein or a signaling molecule for the control of cell growth and morphogenesis. In the present study, we have examined the role of murine Mtss1 in PDGF signal transduction and found that this growth factor stimulated Mtss1-GFP tyrosine phosphorylation. Several lines of evidence indicate that Mtss1 is a direct substrate of Src, a kinase that is known to be activated upon PDGF stimulation (29Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These include the inhibition of Mtss1 phosphorylation by Src inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 3A), the ability of recombinant Src to phosphorylate recombinant Mtss1 directly in vitro (Fig. 4A), and poor phosphorylation in Src knock-out cells (Fig. 3B). In addition, Mtss1-GFP phosphorylation was elevated in NIH3T3 cells overexpressing either oncogenic Src (Fig. 4C) or Fgr (Fig. 3D), a Src-related kinase. However, tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1-GFP was not abolished in either Src knock-out cells or cells with depletion of Src, Yes, and Fyn (Fig. 4, B and C), which are the most abundant Src family members in fibroblasts (25Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This suggests that other tyrosine kinases may also be involved in Mtss1 phosphorylation in cells. Consistent with the notion, we have also observed that phosphorylation of Mtss1 was significantly elevated in cells co-expressing Fyn and Syk (data not shown), suggesting that Syk or its related kinases could synergize Src kinases in phosphorylation of Mtss1. It is also possible that phosphorylation of Mtss1 is regulated by other mechanisms. It has been reported that Mtss1 interacts with protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor δ (15Woodings J.A. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding motif for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ is located within the central region downstream of IMD and upstream of WH2 domain (15Woodings J.A. Sharp S.J. Machesky L.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the area that contains Tyr-397 and Tyr-398, two major phosphotyrosine residues. Therefore, it is possible that receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ could play a negative role in the regulation of Mtss1 during serum starvation and such inhibitory activity might be relieved upon PDGF stimulation. Characterization of the effect of PDGF on the interaction between Mtss1 and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ would ultimately specify the position of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase δ in the Mtss1 signaling pathway. The physiological significance of tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1 has been indicated by the observation that a mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation was unable to promote efficiently the PDGF-mediated dorsal ruffling. However, the mechanism by which tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1 regulates dorsal ruffling is presently unclear. We have previously reported that Mtss1 binds to cortactin, a major component of the cortical actin network that is intimately involved in Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Association with cortactin becomes more evident in the dorsal membrane ruffles of NIH3T3 cells induced by PDGF (Fig. 1B). At this time we are unable to determine whether ruffle-associated Mtss1 represents exclusively the phosphorylated form as there are no available antibodies that specifically detect phosphorylated Mtss1. Also, phosphorylation-deficient mutant appears to bind to cortactin similarly as the wild type Mtss1 (data not shown), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is not indispensable for cortactin binding. Nevertheless, tyrosine phosphorylation could regulate other functions of Mtss1. For example, our previous study has shown that Mtss1 inhibits actin polymerization mediated by neuronal-WASP-activated Arp2/3 complex (19Lin J. Liu J. Wang Y. Zhu J. Zhou K. Smith N. Zhan X. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2059-2066Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Such inhibitory activity may be circumvented upon phosphorylation of Mtss1 during PDGF stimulation, resulting in increase in actin polymerization and membrane rufflings. It is interesting to note that a mutant with deletion of the CCD motif failed to be phosphorylated upon PDGF treatment (Fig. 5B). The CCD motif contains a putative F-actin binding domain and presumably locates in the interface of the homodimer, based on a recently established structural model for IRSp53 (17Gonzalez-Quevedo R. Shoffer M. Horng L. Oro A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), an IMD-containing protein. A previous study with an amino-terminal-truncated mutant suggested that CCD may be involved in homodimerization as well as F-actin binding (17Gonzalez-Quevedo R. Shoffer M. Horng L. Oro A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to observe any significant change of the CCD deletion mutant in the ability to form a dimer with either wild type or the mutant Mtss1 (data not shown), indicating that the CCD motif may have a function other than dimerization. Indeed, we have found that the mutant was unable to translocate into the cell leading edge in response to PDGF (Fig. 5A). Because the formation of the leading edge is dependent upon actin polymerization, this result suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of Mtss1 may require translocation to a proper cellular compartment wherein actin polymerization actively takes place. Interestingly, overexpressing either the CCD deletion mutant or tyrosine phosphorylation-deficient mutant has shown a certain degree of inhibition of dorsal rufflings (Fig. 6B), suggesting these mutants may have a dominant negative activity. However, expression of Mtss1 in NIH3T3 cells is extremely low (4Wang Y. Liu J. Smith E. Zhou K. Liao J. Yu G.Y. Zhan X. Cancer Investig. 2007; (in press)Google Scholar), raising a possibility that these mutants may interfere with the function of other cellular proteins. Because both mutants maintain the ability to form a dimer, these mutants could bind to other IMD-containing proteins through a similar mechanism for dimerization. We thank Drs. Jeff Winkle and Dan Yu for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2068291056,"Activation of CD40 on hepatocytes and cholangiocytes is critical for amplifying Fas-mediated apoptosis in the human liver. C4b-Binding Protein (C4BP) has been reported to act as a potential surrogate ligand for CD40, suggesting that it could be involved in modulating liver epithelial cell survival. Using surface plasmon resonance (BiaCore) analysis supported by gel filtration we have shown that C4BP does not bind CD40, but it forms stable high molecular weight complexes with soluble CD40 ligand (sCD154). These C4BP/sCD154 complexes bound efficiently to immobilised CD40, but when applied to cholangiocytes they failed to induce apoptosis or proliferation or to activate NFkB, AP-1 or STAT 3, which are activated by sCD154 alone. Thus C4BP can modulate CD40/sCD154 interactions by presenting a high molecular weight multimeric sCD154/C4BP complex that suppresses critical intracellular signalling pathways, permitting cell survival without inducing proliferation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated co-localisation and enhanced expression of C4BP and CD40 in human liver cancers. These findings suggest a novel pathway whereby components of the complement system and TNF ligands and receptors might be involved in modulating epithelial cell survival in chronic inflammation and malignant disease."
https://openalex.org/W2020288219,"The transcriptional activity of the integrated HIV provirus is dependent on the chromatin organization of the viral promoter and the transactivator Tat. Tat recruits the cellular pTEFb complex and interacts with several chromatin-modifying enzymes, including the histone acetyltransferases p300 and PCAF. Here, we examined the interaction of Tat with activation-dependent histone kinases, including the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2). Dominant-negative RSK2 and treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of RSK2 kinase activity inhibited the transcriptional activity of Tat, indicating that RSK2 is important for Tat function. Reconstitution of RSK2 in cells from subjects with a genetic defect in RSK2 expression (Coffin-Lowry syndrome) enhanced Tat transactivation. Tat interacted with RSK2 and activated RSK2 kinase activity in cells. Both properties were lost in a mutant Tat protein (F38A) that is deficient in HIV transactivation. Our data identify a novel reciprocal regulation of Tat and RSK2 function, which might serve to induce early changes in the chromatin organization of the HIV LTR."
