https://openalex.org/W2102459914,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce signals from the extracellular environment to intracellular proteins. To gain structural insight into the regulation of receptor cytoplasmic conformations by extracellular ligands during signaling, we examine the structural dynamics of the cytoplasmic domain of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) using (19)F-fluorine NMR and double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy. These studies show that unliganded and inverse-agonist-bound β2AR exists predominantly in two inactive conformations that exchange within hundreds of microseconds. Although agonists shift the equilibrium toward a conformation capable of engaging cytoplasmic G proteins, they do so incompletely, resulting in increased conformational heterogeneity and the coexistence of inactive, intermediate, and active states. Complete transition to the active conformation requires subsequent interaction with a G protein or an intracellular G protein mimetic. These studies demonstrate a loose allosteric coupling of the agonist-binding site and G-protein-coupling interface that may generally be responsible for the complex signaling behavior observed for many GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2144813428,"The circadian timing system synchronizes cellular function by coordinating rhythmic transcription via a transcription-translational feedback loop. How the circadian system regulates gene expression at the translational level remains a mystery. Here, we show that the key circadian transcription factor BMAL1 associates with the translational machinery in the cytosol and promotes protein synthesis. The mTOR-effector kinase, ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (S6K1), an important regulator of translation, rhythmically phosphorylates BMAL1 at an evolutionarily conserved site. S6K1-mediated phosphorylation is critical for BMAL1 to both associate with the translational machinery and stimulate protein synthesis. Protein synthesis rates demonstrate circadian oscillations dependent on BMAL1. Thus, in addition to its critical role in circadian transcription, BMAL1 is a translation factor that links circadian timing and the mTOR signaling pathway. More broadly, these results expand the role of the circadian clock to the regulation of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1572824320,"Lysyl oxidases (LOXs) are a family of copper-dependent oxido-deaminases that can modify the side chain of lysyl residues in collagen and elastin, thereby leading to the spontaneous formation of non-reducible aldehyde-derived interpolypeptide chain cross-links. The consequences of LOX inhibition in producing lathyrism are well documented, but the consequences on collagen fibril formation are less clear. Here we used β-aminoproprionitrile (BAPN) to inhibit LOX in tendon-like constructs (prepared from human tenocytes), which are an experimental model of cell-mediated collagen fibril formation. The improvement in structure and strength seen with time in control constructs was absent in constructs treated with BAPN. As expected, BAPN inhibited the formation of aldimine-derived cross-links in collagen, and the constructs were mechanically weak. However, an unexpected finding was that BAPN treatment led to structurally abnormal collagen fibrils with irregular profiles and widely dispersed diameters. Of special interest, the abnormal fibril profiles resembled those seen in some Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome phenotypes. Importantly, the total collagen content developed normally, and there was no difference in COL1A1 gene expression. Collagen type V, decorin, fibromodulin, and tenascin-X proteins were unaffected by the cross-link inhibition, suggesting that LOX regulates fibrillogenesis independently of these molecules. Collectively, the data show the importance of LOX for the mechanical development of early collagenous tissues and that LOX is essential for correct collagen fibril shape formation."
https://openalex.org/W2139468443,"Cells adapt to temperature shifts by adjusting levels of lipid desaturation and membrane fluidity. This fundamental process occurs in nearly all forms of life, but its mechanism in eukaryotes is unknown. We discovered that the evolutionarily conserved Caenorhabditis elegans gene acdh-11 (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [ACDH]) facilitates heat adaptation by regulating the lipid desaturase FAT-7. Human ACDH deficiency causes the most common inherited disorders of fatty acid oxidation, with syndromes that are exacerbated by hyperthermia. Heat upregulates acdh-11 expression to decrease fat-7 expression. We solved the high-resolution crystal structure of ACDH-11 and established the molecular basis of its selective and high-affinity binding to C11/C12-chain fatty acids. ACDH-11 sequesters C11/C12-chain fatty acids and prevents these fatty acids from activating nuclear hormone receptors and driving fat-7 expression. Thus, the ACDH-11 pathway drives heat adaptation by linking temperature shifts to regulation of lipid desaturase levels and membrane fluidity via an unprecedented mode of fatty acid signaling."

https://openalex.org/W241169641,"Human protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 9 symmetrically dimethylates arginine residues on splicing factor SF3B2 (SAP145) and has been functionally linked to the regulation of alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on this enzyme and its substrate had revealed essential unique residues in the double E loop and the importance of the C-terminal duplicated methyltransferase domain. In contrast to what had been observed with other PRMTs and their physiological substrates, a peptide containing the methylatable Arg-508 of SF3B2 was not recognized by PRMT9 in vitro. Although amino acid substitutions of residues surrounding Arg-508 had no great effect on PRMT9 recognition of SF3B2, moving the arginine residue within this sequence abolished methylation. PRMT9 and PRMT5 are the only known mammalian enzymes capable of forming symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) residues as type II PRMTs. We demonstrate here that the specificity of these enzymes for their substrates is distinct and not redundant. The loss of PRMT5 activity in mouse embryo fibroblasts results in almost complete loss of SDMA, suggesting that PRMT5 is the primary SDMA-forming enzyme in these cells. PRMT9, with its duplicated methyltransferase domain and conserved sequence in the double E loop, appears to have a unique structure and specificity among PRMTs for methylating SF3B2 and potentially other polypeptides."

Traditional techniques using biochemical, genetic or cell biological approaches have made important contributions to our understanding of cellular signaling. However, the single-gene approach does not take into account the full complexity of cell signaling. With the availability of omics techniques, great progress has been made in understanding signaling networks. Omics approaches can be classified into two categories: 'molecular profiling', including genomic, proteomic, post-translational modification and interactome profiling; and 'molecular perturbation', including genetic and functional perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W1499972531,"Angiogenesis is a highly regulated process orchestrated by the VEGF system. Heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) have been identified as co-receptors, yet the mechanisms of action have not been fully defined. In the present study, we characterized molecular interactions between receptors and co-receptors, using surface plasmon resonance and in vitro binding assays. Additionally, we demonstrate that these binding events are relevant to VEGF activity within endothelial cells. We defined interactions and structural requirements for heparin/HS interactions with VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1, NRP-1, and VEGF165 in complex with VEGFR-2 and NRP-1. We demonstrate that these structural requirements are distinct for each interaction. We further show that VEGF165, VEGFR-2, and monomeric NRP-1 bind weakly to heparin alone yet show synergistic binding to heparin when presented together in various combinations. This synergistic binding appears to translate to alterations in VEGF signaling in endothelial cells. We found that soluble NRP-1 increases VEGF binding and activation of VEGFR-2 and ERK1/2 in endothelial cells and that these effects require sulfated HS. These data suggest that the presence of HS/heparin and NRP-1 may dictate the specific receptor type activated by VEGF and ultimately determine the biological output of the system. The ability of co-receptors to fine-tune VEGF responsiveness suggests the possibility that VEGF-mediated angiogenesis can be selectively stimulated or inhibited by targeting HS/heparin and NRP-1."
https://openalex.org/W312277798,"Anthocyanins are essential contributors to fruit coloration, an important quality feature and a breed determining trait of a sweet cherry fruit. It is well established that the biosynthesis of anthocyanins is regulated by an interplay of specific transcription factors belonging to MYB and bHLH families accompanied by a WD40 protein. In this study, we isolated and analyzed PaWD40, PabHLH3, PabHLH33, and several closely related MYB10 gene variants from different cultivars of sweet cherry, analyzed their expression in fruits with different anthocyanin levels at several developmental stages, and determined their capabilities to modulate anthocyanin synthesis in leaves of two Nicotiana species. Our results indicate that transcription level of variant PaMYB10.1-1 correlates with fruit coloration, but anthocyanin synthesis in Nicotiana was induced by another variant, PaMYB10.1-3, which is moderately expressed in fruits. The analysis of two fruit-expressed bHLH genes revealed that PabHLH3 enhances MYB-induced anthocyanin synthesis, whereas PabHLH33 has strong inhibitory properties."
https://openalex.org/W1546498696,"Aim We aimed to investigate whether different measures of obesity could similarly predict atrial fibrillation, and whether the atrial fibrillation risk associated with obesity is dependent on presence of metabolic syndrome. Material and Methods We performed our study in a population-based longitudinal cardiovascular study, comprising 1 924 men and 2 097 women, aged 60 years, from Stockholm. Body mass index, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter and components of metabolic syndrome (systolic- and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were recorded at baseline. Participants were classified by their body mass index (normal weight, overweight or obese), waist circumference (normal, semi-elevated or elevated), and according to presence of metabolic syndrome. Atrial fibrillation risk was estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for common atrial fibrillation risk factors, expressed as HR and 95% CI. Results During a mean follow-up of 13.6 years, 285 incident atrial fibrillation cases were recorded. One standard deviation increment of each obesity measure was associated with increased atrial fibrillation risk as: body mass index 1.25 (1.12 – 1.40), waist circumference 1.35 (1.19 – 1.54) and sagittal abdominal diameter 1.28 (1.14 – 1.44). Compared to normal weight subjects without metabolic syndrome, increased atrial fibrillation risk was noted for overweight subjects with metabolic syndrome, 1.67 (1.16 – 2.41), obese subjects without metabolic syndrome, 1.75 (1.11 – 2.74) and obese subjects with metabolic syndrome, 1.92 (1.34 – 2.74). Compared to subjects with normal waist circumference without metabolic syndrome, subjects with elevated waist circumference and metabolic syndrome suffered increased atrial fibrillation risk, 2.03 (1.44 – 2.87). Conclusions Body mass index, waist circumference and sagittal abdominal diameter could similarly predict atrial fibrillation. Obesity was associated with an increased atrial fibrillation risk regardless of metabolic syndrome, whereas overweight and elevated waist circumference was associated with increased atrial fibrillation risk only if metabolic syndrome was present."

We previously reported that Fut8-knock-out (Fut8−/−) mice showed a schizophrenia-like phenotype and a decrease in working memory. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we analyzed early form long term potentiation (E-LTP), which is closely related to learning and memory in the hippocampus. The scale of E-LTP induced by high frequency stimulation was significantly decreased in Fut8−/− mice. Tetraethylammonium-induced LTP showed no significant differences, suggesting that the decline in E-LTP was caused by postsynaptic events. Unexpectedly, the phosphorylation levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), an important mediator of learning and memory in postsynapses, were greatly increased in Fut8−/− mice.

Schizophrenia is a common, chronic, and severe brain disorder that ranks as one of the leading causes of disability worldwide because it afflicts 2% of the world's population (1Freedman R.

The etiology of schizophrenia is only partially understood, but multiepisode patients show significantly disturbed neuronal plasticity, suggesting that synaptic activity and connectivity are altered during the progression of the disease. Recently, cognitive impairments, such as deficits in learning and memory, have also been shown to be a fundamental feature of the disorder (3Savanthrapadian S. Wolff A.R. Logan B.J. Eckert M.J.

The induction of LTP begins with the activation of one kind of ionotropic glutamate receptor, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors (AMPARs), which induce the opening of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which are another kind of glutamate receptor, and leads to calcium entry that initiates a biochemical cascade through the activation of CaMKII, thereby increasing the number of AMPARs in the postsynaptic density (PSD) area. The end product of this biological reaction is the long lasting potentiation of AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current (6Lisman J. Yasuda R. Raghavachari S.

Previous research has focused on identifying genes or protein expression-level changes in schizophrenia and ascertaining the functional effects of those alterations. Recently, the post-translational modification, N-glycosylation, has become a new target of investigation for schizophrenia (8Khoury G.A. Baliban R.C. Floudas C.A.

The importance of fucosylation has been highlighted by the identification of the monogenetic inherited human disease, congenital disorder of glycosylation IIc (12Etzioni A. Frydman M. Pollack S. Avidor I. Phillips M.L. Paulson J.C. Gershoni-Baruch R. Brief report: recurrent severe infections caused by a novel leukocyte adhesion deficiency.N. Engl. J.

In fact, the unique structure of the core fucosylated N-glycans is highly expressed in brain tissues, and the expression patterns of N-glycans are altered during brain development (17Nakakita S.

To evaluate the effect of core fucosylation on LTP, we investigated synaptic strength and plasticity in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus of Fut8−/− mice. We found that high frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP was decreased in Fut8−/− mice. The molecular mechanism could have been caused by the aberrant heteromerization of AMPAR constitutively activating intracellular signaling, which may disturb LTP in Fut8−/− mice. The Fut8−/− mice were generated as described previously (16Fukuda T. Hashimoto H. Okayasu N. Kameyama A. Onogi H. Nakagawasai O. Nakazawa T. Kurosawa T. Hao Y. Isaji T. Tadano T. Narimatsu H.

All experiments were conducted with female and 3–5-week-old Fut8−/− and wild-type (Fut8+/+) mice. The mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room with a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle and ad libitum feeding. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, Japan. Polyclonal antibodies against GluA1 and GluA2 (subunits of AMPAR) were obtained from Abcam; PSD95 was from Millipore; and GluA3, GluN2A, GluN2B (subunits of NMDAR), and CaMKII-α were from Cell Signaling. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies against GluN1, stargazin (TARP γ2), and synapsin-1 were from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal antibody against α-tubulin was from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated CaMKII at Thr-286, GluN2A at Tyr-1246, and GluN2B at Tyr-1472 all were obtained from Cell Signaling. Biotinylated Aleuria aurantia lectin was purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Pholiota squarrosa lectin-Biotin conjugate agarose bead, which specifically recognizes core fucosylated N-glycans, was a generous gift from Dr. Kobayashi Yuka (J-Oil Mills, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The magnetic protein A beads were from Invitrogen, and the avidin-biotin-agarose beads were from Millipore. Tetraethylammonium (TEA), kynurenic acid, and lidocaine all were obtained from Sigma.

Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared from 3–5-week-old mice decapitated under isoflurance anesthesia. For the dissection, the cutting solution contained 229 mm mannitol, 3 mm KCl, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm H3PO4, 7 mm MgCl2, and 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4, along with a mixed gas that was 95% O2 and 5% CO2, 1 mm kynurenic acid, and 200 μm lidocaine. For TEA-induced LTP recording, a surgical cut was additionally made between CA3 and CA1 to prevent epileptiform bursting. Slices were incubated at 34 °C for 1 h with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, which contained 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4, with a mixed gas that was 95% O2 and 5% CO2. During the recording experiments, slices were superfused with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid flow (2 ml/min, 34 °C). Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region using glass microelectrodes (tip diameters, 10 μm), which were filled with 1.78% Na2SO4 solution. A tungsten bipolar electrode was used to stimulate the Schaffer collateral axons and twin pulses at 200-μs duration and 50-ms intervals applied at a frequency of 0.033 Hz, with an intensity of less than 100 μA. The field excitatory postsynaptic potential was amplified and digitized using a conventional electrophysiological system (Axon Axopatch 200B plus Digidata1200B, Molecular Devices) and analyzed using Clampex version 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). A baseline recording was performed for at least 1 h. Then E-LTP was induced by applying a single 100-Hz train for 1 s at test strength. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel-dependent LTP was induced by applying 25 mm TEA for 10 min (18Ohta H. Sakai S. Ito S. Ishizuka T. Fukazawa Y. Kemuriyama T. Tandai-Hiruma M. Mushiake H. Sato Y. Yawo H.

After culturing for 14 days on glass-bottom dishes (Greiner Bio-one), the cultured media were replaced by a fresh medium containing 2 μm Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM (Dojindo, Japan) at 37 °C for 1 h to load and sensitize the probe by cleaving its AM group with cytosolic esterase. Fura-2-loaded cells were washed with a balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, consisting of 20 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 μm MgSO4, and 1.8 μm CaCl2. Indirect responses were blocked via the application of 1 μm tetrodotoxin in all procedures (20Padjen A.L. Smith P.A. The role of the electrogenic sodium pump in the glutamate afterhyperpolarization of frog spinal cord.J. Physiol. 1983; 336: 433-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Then cells were exposed to either 1 or 3 μm glutamate plus 10 μm glycine containing a balanced salt solution flow (1.75 ml/min, 34 °C) for 1 min, respectively, followed by a 3-min balanced salt solution flow wash. The AMPAR-mediated Ca2+ influx was blocked by an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione or d-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The images were acquired at emission wavelengths between 490 and 520 nm while being excited sequentially at 340 (red) and 380 (green) nm (exposure time, 0.1–2 s). The ratio of F340/F380, indicating an influx efficiency of Ca2+, was analyzed by using an image processor (Aqua Q, Hamamatsu, Japan) connected to a cooled CCD camera (Orca, Hamamatsu, Japan) (21Kanatsu Y.

For Western blot, tissues were homogenized with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque), and 1% phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Nacalai Tesque). For immunoprecipitation, tissues were homogenized with 50 mm Tris-HCl plus 1% protease inhibitor mixture. Membrane fractions were sedimented by centrifugation (105,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C) and dissolved in 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture for 45 min in a 37 °C water bath. After a subsequent removal of the insoluble materials by centrifugation, the supernatants were obtained for immunoprecipitation. All biochemical experiments were carried out either on ice or at 4 °C (22Morita I. Kakuda S. Takeuchi Y. Itoh S. Kawasaki N. Kizuka Y. Kawasaki T. Oka S.

Dissected sections of mouse brains were homogenized with 10 volumes of buffer A (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) with 15 up and down strokes at 1,000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min to remove the nuclear fraction and large debris. The supernatant (S1, postnuclear fraction) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to yield a crude synaptosome pellet (P2) and the supernatant (S2). The S2 was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min to yield a light membrane pellet (P3). The P2 fraction was lysed with hypo-osmotic (10% buffer A + 90% H2O) buffer and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min to yield the synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1). The LP1 fraction was then suspended in 0.5% Triton X-100 in buffer A for 15 min and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h to yield the PSD fraction. All pellet fractions were dissolved in 0.5% SDS. The protein concentration of each fraction was adjusted to 2 μg/μl using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo). Cells cultured under different conditions were washed with PBS and lysed with lysis buffer that contained 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were separated in SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and were then transferred to PVDF membranes. For Western blot, the membranes were blocked in 5% dried skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature and probed with specific primary antibodies followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies that had been conjugated with HRP. Finally, specific proteins were visualized using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). These membranes were stripped and reprobed with an antibody against the corresponding total proteins to confirm equal loading. For lectin blot, the membranes were blocked in 3% BSA and then detected with A. aurantia lectin. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). For the immunoprecipitation, all of the experiments were carried out on ice or at 4 °C; 2 μg of anti-GluA2 antibodies were attached to 5 μl of magnetic protein A beads in 100 μl of PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein A beads were pelleted and incubated with the membrane lysates or cell lysates for 40 min with constant rotation. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitate was dissolved in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample solution.

Either a two-way analysis of variance or an unpaired Student's t test was used to analyze the statistical significance of these results. Previously, we reported that the Fut8−/− mice exhibited a schizophrenia-like phenotype (16Fukuda T. Hashimoto H. Okayasu N. Kameyama A. Onogi H. Nakagawasai O. Nakazawa T. Kurosawa T. Hao Y. Isaji T. Tadano T. Narimatsu H. Taniguchi N. Gu J. α1,6-Fucosyltransferase-deficient mice exhibit multiple behavioral abnormalities associated with a schizophrenia-like phenotype: importance of the balance between the dopamine and serotonin systems.J.

Synaptic activity and connectivity played important roles during the progression of the schizophrenia (3Savanthrapadian S. Wolff A.R. Logan B.J. Eckert M.J. Bilkey D.K. Abraham W.C. Enhanced hippocampal neuronal excitability and LTP persistence associated with reduced behavioral flexibility in the maternal immune activation model of schizophrenia.Hippocampus. 2013; 23: 1395-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed basal synaptic neurotransmission. First, we recorded the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampus CA1 area (Fig. 1A) and found that the responses to stimuli were more sensitive in Fut8−/− mice than in Fut8+/+ mice, which was confirmed by the input-output curve (Fig. 1B). However, the paired pulse ratio, which indicated presynaptic facilitation, showed no significant difference between Fut8+/+ and Fut8−/− mice (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, based on our previous results from the Y-maze task, we knew that learning and memory could be impaired in Fut8−/− mice (16Fukuda T. Hashimoto H. Okayasu N. Kameyama A. Onogi H. Nakagawasai O. Nakazawa T. Kurosawa T. Hao Y. Isaji T. Tadano T. Narimatsu H. Taniguchi N. Gu J. α1,6-Fucosyltransferase-deficient mice exhibit multiple behavioral abnormalities associated with a schizophrenia-like phenotype: importance of the balance between the dopamine and serotonin systems.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 18434-18443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We further examined the formation of E-LTP, which is generally used as a primary experimental model of memory formation in neuronal circuits. E-LTP was triggered by the application of HFS, and we found that the scale of E-LTP was significantly decreased in Fut8−/− mice, compared with Fut8+/+ mice (Fig. 1D), but the TEA-induced (voltage-gated Ca2+ channel-dependent) LTP showed no significant difference (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the decline in the E-LTP in Fut8−/− mice was mainly caused by the events in postsynaptic neurons rather than in the presynaptic regions. Above all, Fut8−/− mice showed hyperactivity in basal synaptic transmissions and a decrease in E-LTP in postsynaptic neurons. To examine the events in the postsynaptic regions, we analyzed the activation levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors and CaMKII, which are mainly mediated in the induction and maintenance of E-LTP. We found that the CaMKII, a necessary component of the cellular machinery underlying learning and memory, was greatly activated in Fut8−/− mice (Fig. 2, A and B). Phosphorylation at Thr-286 of CaMKII plays essential roles in LTP, whereas LTP is attenuated in T286A (Thr-286 non-autophosphorylatable) mutant mice (23Ohno M. Frankland P.W. Silva A.J.

Autophosphorylation at Thr286 of the α calcium-calmodulin kinase II in LTP and learning.Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). However, the expression of a constitutively active form of CaMKII into CA1 neurons enhances postsynaptic transmission and prevents further potentiation via synaptic stimulation (25Pettit D.L. Perlman S. Malinow R. Potentiated transmission and prevention of further LTP by increased CaMKII activity in postsynaptic hippocampal slice neurons.Science. 1994; 266: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 26Pi H.J. Otmakhov N. Lemelin D. De Koninck P. Lisman J. Autonomous CaMKII can promote either long-term potentiation or long-term depression, depending on the state of T305/T306 phosphorylation.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8704-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) because the CaMKII and LTP enhance synaptic transmission by the same mechanism (27Lledo P.M. Hjelmstad G.O. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and long-term potentiation enhance synaptic transmission by the same mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 11175-11179Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Thus, to be consistent with those observations, we thought that the persistent activation of CaMKII might lead to a decrease in E-LTP in Fut8−/− mice. Ionotropic glutamate receptors, which can be subdivided into NMDAR, AMPAR, and kainate receptors, mediate most excitatory neuronal transmission (28Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. The glutamate receptor ion channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Among these receptors, NMDAR channels have several unique features, including a voltage-sensitive block by extracellular Mg2+ and a high permeability to Ca2+ (29Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. NMDA receptor subunits: diversity, development and disease.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ block acts as a molecular switch, with the removal of Mg2+ from the pore of the channel when postsynaptic cells are depolarized. The relief of the block leads to the Ca2+ influx through the NMDAR channel that regulates synaptic strength through Ca2+-activated signaling cascades. The phosphorylation of NMDAR is known to alter the channel properties (30Wang Y.T. Yu X.M. Salter M.W. Ca2+-independent reduction of N-methyl-d-aspartate channel activity by protein tyrosine phosphatase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 1721-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Consistent with the activated CaMKII in Fut8−/− mice, in the present study, the expression levels of phosphorylated GluN2A at Tyr-1246 and GluN2B at Tyr-1472 were also increased (Fig. 2, A and B). The rise of intracellular Ca2+ level causes reversible inactivation through the phosphorylation of receptors to prevent more synaptic stimulation (31Medina I. Filippova N. Charton G. Rougeole S. Ben-Ari Y. Khrestchatisky M. Bregestovski P. Calcium-dependent inactivation of heteromeric NMDA receptor-channels expressed in human embryonic kidney cells.J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation of Tyr-1472, the major phosphorylation site by Fyn on GluN2B (32Takasu M.A. Dalva M.B.

https://openalex.org/W297309774,"Nuclear LASP-1 (LIM and SH3 protein-1) has a direct correlation with overall survival of breast cancer patients. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis of a human breast TMA showed that LASP-1 is absent in normal human breast epithelium but the expression increases with malignancy and is highly nuclear in aggressive breast cancer. We investigated whether the chemokines and growth factors present in the tumor microenvironment could trigger nuclear translocation of LASP-1.Treatment of human breast cancer cells with CXCL12, EGF and HRG, and HMEC-CXCR2 cells with CXCL8 facilitated nuclear shuttling of LASP-1. Data from the biochemical analysis of the nuclear and cytosolic fractions further confirmed the nuclear translocation of LASP-1 upon chemokine and growth factor treatment. CXCL12-dependent nuclear import of LASP-1 could be blocked by CXCR4 antagonist, AMD-3100. Knock down of LASP-1 resulted in alterations in gene expression leading to an increased level of cell-junction and extracellular matrix proteins and an altered cytokine secretory profile. Three-dimensional cultures of human breast cancer cells on Matrigel revealed an altered colony growth, morphology and arborization pattern in LASP-1 knockdown cells. Functional analysis of the LASP-1 knockdown cells revealed increased adhesion to collagen IV and decreased invasion through the Matrigel. Proteomic analysis of immunoprecipitates of LASP-1 and subsequent validation approaches revealed that LASP-1 associated with the epigenetic machinery especially UHRF1, DNMT1, G9a and the transcription factor Snail1. Interestingly, LASP-1 associated with UHRF1, G9a, Snail1 and di- and tri-methylated histoneH3 in a CXCL12-dependent manner based on immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. LASP-1 also directly bound to Snail1 which may stabilize Snail1. Thus, nuclear LASP-1 appears to functionally serve as a hub for the epigenetic machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1494364802,"We investigated spontaneous magnetic alignment (SMA) by juvenile snapping turtles using exposure to low-level radio frequency (RF) fields at the Larmor frequency to help characterize the underlying sensory mechanism. Turtles, first introduced to the testing environment without the presence of RF aligned consistently towards magnetic north when subsequent magnetic testing conditions were also free of RF ('RF off → RF off'), but were disoriented when subsequently exposed to RF ('RF off → RF on'). In contrast, animals initially introduced to the testing environment with RF present were disoriented when tested without RF ('RF on → RF off'), but aligned towards magnetic south when tested with RF ('RF on → RF on'). Sensitivity of the SMA response of yearling turtles to RF is consistent with the involvement of a radical pair mechanism. Furthermore, the effect of RF appears to result from a change in the pattern of magnetic input, rather than elimination of magnetic input altogether, as proposed to explain similar effects in other systems/organisms. The findings show that turtles first exposed to a novel environment form a lasting association between the pattern of magnetic input and their surroundings. However, under natural conditions turtles would never experience a change in the pattern of magnetic input. Therefore, if turtles form a similar association of magnetic cues with the surroundings each time they encounter unfamiliar habitat, as seems likely, the same pattern of magnetic input would be associated with multiple sites/localities. This would be expected from a sensory input that functions as a global reference frame, helping to place multiple locales (i.e., multiple local landmark arrays) into register to form a global map of familiar space."
https://openalex.org/W1584311799,"Thrombin acts on the endothelium by activating protease-activated receptors (PARs). The endothelial thrombin-PAR system becomes deregulated during pathological conditions resulting in loss of barrier function and a pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic endothelial phenotype. We reported recently that the ion transporter Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) operating in the Ca(2+)-influx (reverse) mode promoted ERK1/2 activation and angiogenesis in vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated primary human vascular endothelial cells. Here, we investigated whether Ca(2+) influx through NCX was involved in ERK1/2 activation, angiogenesis, and endothelial barrier dysfunction in response to thrombin. Reverse-mode NCX inhibitors and RNAi-mediated NCX1 knockdown attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to thrombin or an agonist of PAR-1, the main endothelial thrombin receptor. Conversely, promoting reverse-mode NCX by suppressing Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity enhanced ERK1/2 activation. Reverse-mode NCX inhibitors and NCX1 siRNA suppressed thrombin-induced primary human vascular endothelial cell angiogenesis, quantified as proliferation and tubular differentiation. Reverse-mode NCX inhibitors or NCX1 knockdown preserved barrier integrity upon thrombin stimulation in vitro. Moreover, the reverse-mode NCX inhibitor SEA0400 suppressed Evans' blue albumin extravasation to the lung and kidneys and attenuated edema formation and ERK1/2 activation in the lungs of mice challenged with a peptide activator of PAR-1. Mechanistically, thrombin-induced ERK1/2 activation required NADPH oxidase 2-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and reverse-mode NCX inhibitors and NCX1 siRNA suppressed thrombin-induced ROS production. We propose that reverse-mode NCX is a novel mechanism contributing to thrombin-induced angiogenesis and hyperpermeability by mediating ERK1/2 activation in a ROS-dependent manner. Targeting reverse-mode NCX could be beneficial in pathological conditions involving unregulated thrombin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1518960013,"Background Growth factors, energy sources, and mitochondrial function strongly affect embryo growth and development in vitro. The biological role and prospective significance of the mitofusin gene Mfn2 in the development of preimplantation embryos remain poorly understood. Our goal is to profile the role of Mfn2 in mouse embryos and determine the underlying mechanism of Mfn2 function in embryo development. Methods We transfected Mfn2-siRNA into 2-cell fertilized eggs and then examined the expression of Mfn2, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and the apoptosis-promoting protein Bax by Western blot. Additionally, we determined the blastocyst formation rate and measured ATP levels, mtDNA levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and apoptosis in all of the embryos. Results The results indicate that the Mfn2 and Bcl-2 levels were markedly decreased, whereas Bax levels were increased in the T group (embryos transfected with Mfn2-siRNA) compared with the C group (embryos transfected with control-siRNA). The blastocyst formation rate was significantly decreased in the T group. The ATP content and the relative amounts of mtDNA and cDNA in the T group were significantly reduced compared with the C group. In the T group, ΔΨm and Ca2+ levels were reduced, and the number of apoptotic cells was increased. Conclusion Low in vitro expression of Mfn2 attenuates the blastocyst formation rate and cleavage speed in mouse zygotes and causes mitochondrial dysfunction, as confirmed by the ATP and mtDNA levels and mitochondrial membrane potential. Mfn2 deficiency induced apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Bax and Ca2+ pathways. These findings indicate that Mfn2 could affect preimplantation embryo development through mitochondrial function and cellular apoptosis."

The effect of anti-diabetic therapy (ADT) on carcinogenesis among diabetic patients is also unclear.Using population-based representative insurance claims data in Taiwan, 36,270 DM patients and 145,080 comparison subjects without DM were identified from claims from 2005 to 2010. The association between the top ten leading causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan and DM was evaluated. Whether ADT altered the risk of developing cancer was also investigated.Incidence of cancer at any site was significantly higher in patients with DM than in those without (p<0.001). The risk of carcinogenesis imparted by DM was greatest in gastroenterological malignancies (liver, pancreas, and colorectal cancer) as well as lung, breast and oral cancer (p<0.001). Among the oral types of ADT, metformin decreased the risk of lung and liver cancer, but had less effect on reducing the risk of colorectal cancer. α-glucosidase inhibitor decreased the risk of developing liver, colorectal, and breast cancer. Apart from intermediate-acting insulin, rapid-acting, long-acting, and combination insulin treatment significantly reduced the overall cancer risk among all DM patients. In subgroup analysis, long-acting insulin treatment significantly decreased the risk of lung, liver, and colorectal cancer.Our results supported the notion that pre-existing DM increases the incidence of gastroenterological cancer. ADT, especially metformin, α-glucosidase inhibitor, and long-acting insulin treatment, may protect patients with DM against these malignancies. It is crucial that oncologists should closely collaborate with endocrinologists to provide an optimal cancer-specific therapy and diabetic treatment to patients simultaneously with cancer and DM."

https://openalex.org/W1515841604,"Activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs widely in human cancers. Although somatic mutations in the PI3K pathway genes PIK3CA and PTEN are known to drive PI3K pathway activation and cancer growth, the significance of somatic mutations in other PI3K pathway genes is less clear. Here, we establish the signaling and oncogenic properties of a recurrent somatic mutation in the PI3K p110β isoform that resides within its kinase domain (PIK3Cβ(D1067V)). We initially observed PIK3Cβ(D1067V) by exome sequencing analysis of an EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor biopsy from a patient with acquired erlotinib resistance. On the basis of this finding, we hypothesized that PIK3Cβ(D1067V) might function as a novel tumor-promoting genetic alteration, and potentially an oncogene, in certain cancers. Consistent with this hypothesis, analysis of additional tumor exome data sets revealed the presence of PIK3Cβ(D1067V) at low frequency in other patient tumor samples (including renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, thyroid carcinoma and endometrial carcinoma). Functional studies revealed that PIK3Cβ(D1067V) promoted PI3K pathway signaling, enhanced cell growth in vitro, and was sufficient for tumor formation in vivo. Pharmacologic inhibition of PIK3Cβ with TGX-221 (isoform-selective p110β inhibitor) specifically suppressed growth in patient-derived renal-cell carcinoma cells with endogenous PIK3Cβ(D1067V) and in NIH-3T3 and human EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells engineered to express this mutant PI3K. In the EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells, expression of PIK3Cβ(D1067V) also promoted erlotinib resistance. Our data establish a novel oncogenic form of PI3K, revealing the signaling and oncogenic properties of PIK3Cβ(D1067V) and its potential therapeutic relevance in cancer. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying PI3K pathway activation in human tumors and indicate that PIK3Cβ(D1067V) is a rational therapeutic target in certain cancers."
https://openalex.org/W219269172,"The incidence of obesity is increasing worldwide. It was reported that endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) could inhibit insulin receptor signaling by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the liver. However, the relationship between ERS and insulin receptor signaling in the brain during obesity remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to assess whether ERS alters insulin receptor signaling through the hyper-activation of JNK in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in the brains of obese rats. Obesity was induced using a high fat diet (HFD). The Morris water maze test was then performed to evaluate decreases in cognitive function, and western blot was used to verify whether abnormal insulin receptor signaling was induced by ERS in HFD rats exhibiting cognitive decline. In addition, to determine whether ERS activated JNK and consequently impaired insulin receptor signaling, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, followed by tunicamycin or thapsigargin, and primary rat hippocampal and cortical neurons were transfected with siRNA against IRE1α and JNK. We found that the expression of phosphorylation of PKR-like kinase (PERK), phosphorylation of α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), and phosphorylation of inositol-requiring kinase-1α (IRE-1α) were increased in the brains of rats with HFD when compared with control rats. The level of serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was also increased, while protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) was reduced. ERS was also found to inhibit insulin receptor signaling via the activation of JNK in SH-SY5Y cells, primary rat hippocampal, and cortical neurons. These results indicate that ERS was increased, thereby resulting in impaired insulin receptor signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of obese rats."
https://openalex.org/W1538274695,"Metastatic invasion of tumors into peripheral tissues is known to rely upon protease-mediated degradation of the surrounding stroma. This remodeling process uses complex, actin-based, specializations of the plasma membrane termed invadopodia that act both to sequester and release matrix metalloproteinases. Here we report that cells of mesenchymal origin, including tumor-associated fibroblasts, degrade substantial amounts of surrounding matrix by a mechanism independent of conventional invadopodia. These degradative sites lack the punctate shape of conventional invadopodia to spread along the cell base and are reticular and/or fibrous in character. In marked contrast to invadopodia, this degradation does not require the action of Src kinase, Cdc42 or Dyn2. Rather, inhibition of Dyn2 causes a marked upregulation of stromal matrix degradation. Further, expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases are differentially regulated between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts. This matrix remodeling by fibroblasts increases the invasive capacity of tumor cells, thereby illustrating how the tumor microenvironment can contribute to metastasis. These findings provide evidence for a novel matrix remodeling process conducted by stromal fibroblasts that is substantially more effective than conventional invadopodia, distinct in structural organization and regulated by disparate molecular mechanisms."

Neurons in the LC of Mecp2-null mice are overly excited, likely resulting from a defect in neuronal intrinsic membrane properties and a deficiency in GABA synaptic inhibition.

Here we show evidence for augmentation of the extrasynaptic GABAARs in Mecp2-null mice.

https://openalex.org/W1831040894,"Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is the primordial member of the neuronal calcium sensor family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins. It interacts with both the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), regulating its internalization and surface expression, and the cognate kinases GRK1 and GRK2. Determination of the crystal structures of Ca2+/NCS-1 alone and in complex with peptides derived from D2R and GRK1 reveals that the differential recognition is facilitated by the conformational flexibility of the C-lobe-binding site. We find that two copies of the D2R peptide bind within the hydrophobic crevice on Ca2+/NCS-1, but only one copy of the GRK1 peptide binds. The different binding modes are made possible by the C-lobe-binding site of NCS-1, which adopts alternative conformations in each complex. C-terminal residues Ser-178–Val-190 act in concert with the flexible EF3/EF4 loop region to effectively form different peptide-binding sites. In the Ca2+/NCS-1·D2R peptide complex, the C-terminal region adopts a 310 helix-turn-310 helix, whereas in the GRK1 peptide complex it forms an α-helix. Removal of Ser-178–Val-190 generated a C-terminal truncation mutant that formed a dimer, indicating that the NCS-1 C-terminal region prevents NCS-1 oligomerization. We propose that the flexible nature of the C-terminal region is essential to allow it to modulate its protein-binding sites and adapt its conformation to accommodate both ligands. This appears to be driven by the variability of the conformation of the C-lobe-binding site, which has ramifications for the target specificity and diversity of NCS-1. Neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) is the primordial member of the neuronal calcium sensor family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins. It interacts with both the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), regulating its internalization and surface expression, and the cognate kinases GRK1 and GRK2. Determination of the crystal structures of Ca2+/NCS-1 alone and in complex with peptides derived from D2R and GRK1 reveals that the differential recognition is facilitated by the conformational flexibility of the C-lobe-binding site. We find that two copies of the D2R peptide bind within the hydrophobic crevice on Ca2+/NCS-1, but only one copy of the GRK1 peptide binds.

https://openalex.org/W1596144157,"Background There are limited data describing the clinical characteristics of pyogenic spondylitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). The aim of this study was to investigate the predisposing factors and clinical characteristics of pyogenic spondylitis caused by GNB compared to Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Methods We performed a retrospective review of medical records from patients with culture-confirmed pyogenic spondylitis at four tertiary teaching hospitals over an 8-year period. Results A total of 344 patients with culture-confirmed pyogenic spondylitis were evaluated. There were 62 patients (18.0%) with pyogenic spondylitis caused by GNB and the most common organism was Escherichia coli (n = 35, 10.2%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 10, 2.9%). Pyogenic spondylitis caused by GNB was more frequently associated with the female gender (64.5 vs. 35.5%, P <0.01), preexisting or synchronous genitourinary tract infection (32.3 vs. 2.1%, P< 0.01), and intra-abdominal infection (12.9 vs. 0.4%, P< 0.01) compared to patients with GPC. Although pyogenic spondylitis caused by GNB presented with severe sepsis more frequently (24.2 vs. 11.3%, P = 0.01), the mortality rate (6.0 vs. 5.2%) and the proportion of patients with residual disability (6.0 vs. 9.0%), defined as grade 3 or 4 (P = 0.78) 3 months after completion of treatment, were not significantly different compared to GPC patients. Conclusion GNB should be considered as the etiologic organism when infectious spondylitis develops in a patient with preexisting or synchronous genitourinary tract and intra-abdominal infection. In addition, the mortality rate and clinical outcomes are not significantly different between pyogenic spondylitis caused by GNB and GPC."
https://openalex.org/W273012573,"Cystic papillary thyroid carcinoma (cPTC) is a subgroup of PTC presenting a diagnostic challenge at fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). To further investigate this entity we aimed to characterize protein profiles of cyst fluids from cPTC and benign thyroid cystic lesions. In total, 20 cPTCs and 56 benign thyroid cystic lesions were studied. Profiling by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed on cyst fluids from a subset of cases after depletion, and selected proteins were further analyzed by Western blot (WB), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 1,581 proteins were detected in cyst fluids, of which 841 were quantified in all samples using LC-MS/MS. Proteins with different expression levels between cPTCs and benign lesions were identified by univariate analysis (41 proteins) and multivariate analysis (59 proteins in an orthogonal partial least squares model). WB analyses of cyst fluid and IHC on corresponding tissue samples confirmed a significant up-regulation of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19/CYFRA 21-1) and S100A13 in cPTC vs. benign lesions. These findings were further confirmed by ELISA in an extended material of non-depleted cyst fluids from cPTCs (n = 17) and benign lesions (n = 55) (p<0.05). Applying a cut-off at >55 ng/ml for CK-19 resulted in 82% specificity and sensitivity. For S100A13 a cut-off at >230 pg/ml revealed a 94% sensitivity, but only 35% specificity. This is the first comprehensive catalogue of the protein content in fluid from thyroid cysts. The up-regulations of CK-19 and S100A13 suggest their possible use in FNAB based preoperative diagnostics of cystic thyroid lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1592641771,"Understanding how ecological interactions mitigate the impacts of perturbations such as pesticides in biological communities is an important basic and applied question for ecologists. In aquatic ecosystems, new evidence from microcosm experiments suggests that submerged macrophytes can buffer cladocerans from pulse exposures to the widely used insecticide malathion, and that mitigation increases with macrophyte density. However, whether these results scale up to more complex aquatic communities where ecological interactions such as competition can alter toxicity is unknown. Further, macrophyte abilities to mitigate different insecticide exposure scenarios (i.e. single versus repeated pulses) have never been tested. To address these gaps, we performed a factorial mesocosm experiment examining the influence of four macrophyte treatments (0, 10, 50, or 100 Elodea Canadensis shoots planted per mesocosm) crossed with three malathion exposure scenarios (no insecticide, single pulse, repeated pulses) on aquatic communities containing zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton, two snail species, and larval amphibians. In the absence of macrophytes, single malathion pulses caused short-term declines in cladoceran abundance followed by their rapid recovery, which precluded any indirect effects (i.e. trophic cascades). However, repeated malathion pulses caused cladoceran extinctions, resulting in persistent phytoplankton blooms and reduced abundance of one snail species. In contrast, with macrophytes present, even at low density, malathion had no effect on any taxa. We also discovered novel effects of macrophytes on the benthic food web. In the two highest macrophyte treatments, we observed trends of reduced periphyton biomass, decreased abundance of one snail species, and decreased amphibian time to and mass at metamorphosis. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of negative submerged macrophyte effects on amphibians, a taxa of global conservation concern. Our findings suggest that facilitating macrophytes could be an important strategy for buffering freshwater communities from insecticides, though consideration of their impacts on animal species is necessary."
https://openalex.org/W1593371871,"Syndecans, a family of transmembrane heparansulfate proteoglycans, are known to interact through their transmembrane domains to form non-covalently linked homodimers, a process essential for their individual functions. Because all syndecan transmembrane domains are highly conserved and thus might mediate interactions between different members of the syndecan family, we investigated syndecan interactions in detail. All recombinant syndecan-2 and -4 protein variants containing the transmembrane domain formed not only sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-resistant homodimers but also SDS-resistant heterodimers. Biochemical and structural data revealed that recombinant syndecan-2 and -4 formed intermolecular interactions in vitro, and the GXXXG motif in transmembrane domain mediated this interaction. When exogenously expressed in rat embryonic fibroblasts, syndecan-2 interacted with syndecan-4 and vice versa. Furthermore, bimolecular fluorescence complementation-based assay demonstrated specific hetero-molecular interactions between syndecan-2 and -4, supporting hetero-oligomer formation of syndecans in vivo. Interestingly, hetero-oligomerization significantly reduced syndecan-4-mediated cellular processes such as protein kinase Cα activation and protein kinase Cα-mediated cell adhesion as well as syndecan-2-mediated tumorigenic activities in colon cancer cells such as migration and anchorage-independent growth. Taken together, these data provide evidence that hetero-oligomerization produces distinct syndecan functions and offer insights into the underlying signaling mechanisms of syndecans.

Taken together, these data provide evidence that hetero-oligomerization produces distinct syndecan functions and offer insights into the underlying signaling mechanisms of syndecans. Syndecans are a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans that participate in the regulation of a broad range of adhesion-mediated cell functions (1Tkachenko E. Rhodes J.M. Simons M. Syndecans: new kids on the signaling block.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Structurally, they are composed of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain of syndecans interacts with a number of ligands in the extracellular matrix through heparan sulfate chains and interactions that activate syndecans and lead to their regulation of receptor signaling events (1Tkachenko E. Rhodes J.M. Simons M. Syndecans: new kids on the signaling block.Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 2Rapraeger A.C. Syndecan-regulated receptor signaling.J.

Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 662-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain is composed of 25 hydrophobic amino acid residues that are responsible for the molecular interaction that causes homo-oligomerization of syndecan core proteins (4Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. Self-association of N-syndecan (syndecan-3) core protein is mediated by a novel structural motif in the transmembrane domain and ectodomain flanking region.J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42573-42579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The strictly conserved GXXXG motif is involved in these interactions and induces homodimer formation of syndecans, even in the presence of the strong anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a property known as SDS-resistant dimerization (4Asundi V.K. Carey D.J. Self-association of N-syndecan (syndecan-3) core protein is mediated by a novel structural motif in the transmembrane domain and ectodomain flanking region.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26404-26410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain contains two highly conserved C1 and C2 regions separated by a variable region. The intervening variable region, which is distinct for each syndecan member yet conserved across species, promotes syndecan-specific intracellular functions. Four members of the syndecan family have been identified in vertebrates (6Carey D.J. Syndecans: multifunctional cell-surface co-receptors.Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and their expression is highly regulated in complex patterns in individual cell types and tissues and at different developmental stages (7Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Members of the syndecan family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans are expressed in distinct cell-, tissue-, and development-specific patterns.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Syndecan-1 is the predominant family member in epithelial cells, syndecan-2 is abundantly expressed in fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells, syndecan-3 abounds in neuronal cells, and syndecan-4 is widely expressed (7Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Members of the syndecan family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans are expressed in distinct cell-, tissue-, and development-specific patterns.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Notably, the expression of syndecans is altered in pathological situations such as wound healing and neoplastic transformation. In particular, altered expression of syndecan family members has been reported in various human tumors, including lung, breast, and colorectal cancers (8Fears C.Y. Woods A. The role of syndecans in disease and wound healing.Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Han I. Park H. Oh E.S. New insights into syndecan-2 expression and tumourigenic activity in colon carcinoma cells.J. Mol. Histol. 2004; 35: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Transduction of signals through non-covalent dimerization/oligomerization of cell surface receptor proteins containing a single transmembrane domain in response to ligand binding is a well-recognized signaling paradigm (10Schlessinger J. Cell signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar). As is the case for many other cell surface receptors, homodimerization/oligomerization is the first step in the activation of syndecan signaling, and the syndecan transmembrane domain plays a major role in this process (5Choi S. Lee E. Kwon S. Park H. Yi J.Y. Kim S. Han I.O. Yun Y. Oh E.S. Transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for the functions of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42573-42579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Given the high pairwise sequence identity of syndecan transmembrane domains (48–72%) and the conservation of the GXXXG dimerization motif, all syndecan transmembrane domains might be expected to mediate heteromeric oligomerization as well as homomeric interactions. A previous study using synthetic peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domain of each syndecan paralog has measured the association tendencies of the syndecan transmembrane domain (11Dews I.C. Mackenzie K.R. Transmembrane domains of the syndecan family of growth factor coreceptors display a hierarchy of homotypic and heterotypic interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20782-20787Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This study found that the transmembrane domains of the four syndecan paralogs self-associate to very different degrees and are capable of a distinct set of heteromeric interactions, independent of extracellular and cytoplasmic domains (11Dews I.C. Mackenzie K.R. Transmembrane domains of the syndecan family of growth factor coreceptors display a hierarchy of homotypic and heterotypic interactions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20782-20787Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, whether full-length syndecans form heterodimers and, if so, how this heterodimerization is involved in regulating syndecan functions, have not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate that transmembrane domain-mediated hetero-oligomerization of syndecan-2 with syndecan-4 occurs in vitro and in intact cells and regulates syndecan-mediated signal transduction, producing unique functional outcomes. Monoclonal antibodies against glutathione S-transferase (GST), His, HA, β-actin, RhoA, integrin β1, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phospho-ERK, and polyclonal antibodies against Myc and protein kinase Cα (PKCα) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A monoclonal antibody to α-actinin was purchased from Sigma, and a polyclonal antibody to syndecan-4 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies to paxillin and Rac1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and a monoclonal anti-syndecan-2 antibody was produced by AdipoGen Inc. (Incheon, Korea). Fibronectin was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY).Transient transfection was carried out using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as described by the provided protocol.

Mutations were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the resulting plasmids. These constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α, and the expression of GST fusion proteins was induced by incubation with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare) as described previously (5Choi S. Lee E. Kwon S. Park H. Yi J.Y. Kim S. Han I.O. Yun Y. Oh E.S. Transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for the functions of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42573-42579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the entire rat syndecan-2 or -4 core protein was subcloned into the His expression vector pET32a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the expression of fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 was induced by incubating with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C for 16 h. Proteins were released by lysing E. coli cells with lysis buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100) and sonicating on ice for 1 m. After removing insoluble material by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants containing His-syndecan fusion proteins were applied to a glutathione-agarose column containing pre-bound GST-syndecans. The column was washed 3 times, and bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm reduced glutathione). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using antibodies against GST, His, syndecan-2, and syndecan-4. cDNA encoding the rat transmembrane domain of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4 were subcloned into the His-thioredoxin expression vector pET32a+, and the enterokinase enzyme recognition site, DDDDK, was inserted between His-thioredoxin tag and target protein. Fusion protein expression was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside in optical density values of 0.55 at 600 nm and overexpressed at 25 °C for 18 h. Harvested cell pellet was lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated on ice for 1 m. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min, supernatant was removed, and insoluble precipitant was used for the resolubilization step using refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (Affymetrix). Resolubilized fraction was applied to Ni-NTA affinity column. The column was washed two times using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and target protein was eluted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 250 mm imidazole, 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside. After desalting column work using PD-10 (GE Healthcare), enterokinase enzyme was treated to remove the tag at 37 °C for 12 h. Nonspecific impurity and His-thioredoxin tag was removed using additional Ni-NTA affinity column work. Final target protein was dialyzed in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and lyophilized. For the preparation of NMR samples, M9 minimal media and isotopes such as [13C]glucose and 15NH4Cl were used during cell culture. All NMR samples are prepared in 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, 4 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium azide, 100 mm dodecylphosphocholine, 10% D2O. All NMR spectra were obtained at 318 K on a Bruker DRX 900 MHz spectrometer with CryoprobeTM and processed and analyzed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw and the Sparky program. Sequential resonance assignment was executed using 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence, three-dimensional HNCACB, CBCACONH, and HNCO. NMR titration experiment was performed using 15N-labeled syndecan-4 and unlabeled syndecan-2 transmembrane domain using different molar ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3). Chemical shift change values were calculated using the equation ΔδAV = ((Δδ1H)2 + (Δδ15N/5)2)1/2. For the immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged syndecans, REFs transfected with the indicated cDNAs were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Individual cell lysates were mixed for 30 min on ice, and protein mixtures were incubated with anti-HA affinity Matrix (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, eluted with 1 m NaCl, and analyzed by slot blotting using the indicated antibodies. For the immunoprecipitation of endogenous syndecan proteins, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Each cell lysate was incubated with anti-syndecan antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and eluted with 1 m NaCl. To remove the IgG of eluted proteins and extract the syndecan antibodies, eluted proteins were incubated with DEAE-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 4 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm PMSF, washed with 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, containing 4 m urea, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mm EDTA, and 2 mm PMSF, eluted with 15 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 4 m guanidine HCl and 0.1% Tween-20, and then analyzed by slot blotting using the indicated antibodies. For Western blotting of immunoprecipitates, cells were lysed with 1% radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were incubated with anti-syndecan-4 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and eluted with 1 m NaCl. Glycosaminoglycan chains were removed by incubating samples with a pH 1.5 nitrous acid solution as previously described (12Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Formation of anhydrosugars in the chemical depolymerization of heparin.Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-syndecan-2 antibody. The vector constructs encoding fragments of pECFP were kindly provided by Dr. Minsoo Kim (University of Rochester Medical Center). In the current study the sequences encoding pECFP amino acid residues 1–154 (CN) or 155–238 (CC) were fused to the 3′ ends of the coding regions of syndecans by conventional restriction enzyme-based cloning; the resulting constructs generated are depicted schematically in Fig. 4E. For bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, HT29 cells were transiently co-transfected with the indicated cDNAs then fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss 510 META confocal head using a C-Apochromat 40×/1.2-W objective lens and a 458-nm argon laser light and Meta detector (462.6–516.1 nm) for pECFP excitation and emission. For nonradioactive Peptag assays, PepTag C1 peptide (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (50 μm) in a final volume of 25 μl for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by heating to 95 °C for 10 m. The samples were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel at 100 V for 15 min. Phosphorylated peptides migrated toward the cathode (+), whereas non-phosphorylated peptides migrated toward the anode (−). The gel was photographed on a transilluminator. Cell-substratum adhesiveness was quantified using an inverted centrifugal detachment assay. Fibronectin was diluted in serum-free medium (10 μg/ml), added to the plates, and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. The plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 0.2% heat-inactivated BSA for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for additional 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After removing unattached cells, plates were then filled with serum-free medium, sealed with Parafilm, and centrifuged inverted for 5 min at 300 × g at room temperature using a large capacity tabletop centrifuge (Hanil science industrial, Korea). After the centrifugation, retained cells were counted using a hemocytometer. After washing twice with PBS, a hypo-osmotic solution (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture was added to the culture plates. Cells were subsequently scraped off the plates and homogenized on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was collected by solubilizing the remaining pellet in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies. GST-PAK-PBD binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (13Hecker T.P. Grammer J.R. Gillespie G.Y. Stewart Jr., J. Gladson C.L. Focal adhesion kinase enhances signaling through the Shc/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in anaplastic astrocytoma tumor biopsy samples.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2699-2707PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the p21 binding domain of PAK1 (PBD) was expressed in E. coli as a GST-PAK-PBD fusion protein, purified using glutathione-agarose beads, and added to cell lysates. Bound proteins were collected by centrifugation and suspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, and the amount of precipitated Rac1 was estimated by Western blotting with an anti-Rac1 antibody. Rho activity was measured in a pulldown assay using the Rho binding domain from Rhotekin. Equal volumes of lysates were incubated with GST-Rho binding domain beads at 4 °C for 2 h, after which the beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer, and bound RhoA proteins were detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA. Cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs, fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumen in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with the indicated antibodies. The slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and imaged using a fluorescence confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). Cell spreading and migration were monitored using the xCELLigence system (Roche Diagnostics). For cell spreading, E-plate 16 assemblies (Roche Diagnostics) were coated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) and seeded with cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well). Each plate was then assembled on the RTCA DP Analyzer, and data were gathered at 5-min intervals for 5 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The data were analyzed using the provided RTCA software. For cell migration, a CIM-plate 16 (Roche Diagnostics) was used. The lower chambers were filled with fresh medium (160 μl/well) containing 10 μg/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 and 10% FBS, and the upper chambers were filled with medium (30 μl/well) containing 5% FBS. Plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 h, and background was measured using the RTCA DP Analyzer. Transfected cells were added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 25 °C. After 30 min, the CIM-plate was assembled onto the RTCA DP Analyzer, and cell migration was assessed at 15-min intervals for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The obtained data were analyzed using the provided RTCA software. The lower surface of Transwell inserts (Costar) was coated with gelatin (10 μg/ml), and the membranes were allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature. The Transwell inserts were assembled into a 24-well plate, and the lower chamber was filled with McCoy's 5a media containing 10% FBS and fibroblast growth factor-2 (10 μg/ml). Cells (5 × 105) were added to each upper chamber, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 30 h. Migrated cells were stained with 0.6% hematoxylin and 0.5% eosin and counted. Each well of a 6-well culture plate was coated with 3 ml of bottom agar mixture (McCoy's 5a, 10% FBS, 0.6% agar). After the bottom layer had solidified, 2 ml of top agar mixture (McCoy's 5a, 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.3% agar) containing 2 × 106 cells was added to each well, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Every 5 days, normal growth medium was gently layered over the cultures. Colony formation was monitored daily with a light microscope. Colonies in soft agar were photographed with a digital camera after incubation for 21 days. Data are represented as the mean from at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired Student's t test. A p value less than 0.01 was considered statistically significant. To examine interactions of syndecan molecules, we first investigated the well known property of SDS-resistant dimer formation. Several recombinant syndecan-2 and -4 constructs were generated and expressed in E. coli as GST-fusion proteins (Fig. 1A). Recombinant syndecan proteins were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and purified. wild type syndecans (SDC2 or SDC4) were mixed with deletion mutants of syndecan-2 or -4 containing transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (2TC and 4TC, respectively). Consistent with a previous report (5Choi S. Lee E. Kwon S. Park H. Yi J.Y. Kim S. Han I.O. Yun Y. Oh E.S. Transmembrane domain-induced oligomerization is crucial for the functions of syndecan-2 and syndecan-4.J. Biol.

Interestingly, mixtures of syndecan-2 or -4 proteins with deletion mutants showed only one extra band between the monomer- and dimer-migrating positions, corresponding to a heteromeric molecular mass of ∼90 kDa (Fig. 1B, right; TABLE 1, TABLE 2). Consistently, His-tagged wild type syndecan proteins showed strong SDS-resistant heterodimers (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, His-tagged syndecan-2 formed SDS-resistant dimer with the tag-free recombinant syndecan-4, and the tag-free recombinant syndecan-2 also formed SDS-resistant dimer with His-tagged syndecan-4 (Fig. 1D). In addition, recombinant syndecan-1 formed SDS-resistant heterodimers with syndecan-2 or -4 (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that syndecans form strong SDS-resistant heterodimers as well as homodimers in vitro.TABLE 1The extra band of GST-tagged recombinant protein mixture was identified to be heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (syndecan-2 and -4) by mass spectrometryCalculated massExpected massDelta massScoreSequenceMrMr978.5134978.54720.033827RKPSSAAYQKA1209.54011209.57600.036023KEFEISEAEEKQ1383.73581383.76360.0279111KGSPDLTTSQLIPRI1689.88591689.90980.024012RISLTSAAPEVETMTLKT1689.88591689.92470.038843RISLTSAAPEVETMTLKT1705.88081705.88180.001144RISLTSAAPEVETMTLKT + Oxidation (Met)1705.88081705.90860.02792RISLTSAAPEVETMTLKT + Oxidation (Met)1705.88081705.90920.02858RISLTSAAPEVETMTLKT + Oxidation (Met)3751.53673751.60660.069940KDMYLDSSSIEEASGLYPIDDDDYSSASGSGAYEDKG4511.89694512.02570.128885RAELTSDKDMYLDSSSIEEASGLYPIDDDDYSSASGSGAYEDKG + Oxidation (Met) Open table in a new tab TABLE 2The extra band of GST-tagged recombinant protein mixture was identified to be heparan sulfate proteoglycan core protein (syndecan-2 and -4) by mass spectrometryCalculated massExpected massDelta massScoreSequenceMrMr1612.79441612.81960.025238RETEVIDPQDLLEGRY2752.45482752.49860.043820RTFPEVISPLVPLDNHIPENAQPGIRV Open table in a new tab Because the highly conserved transmembrane domain of syndecan core proteins is responsible for the formation of stable, non-covalent homodimeric complexes, we next investigated whether the transmembrane domain is necessary for heterodimerization. As expected, wild type syndecan-4 formed SDS-resistant heterodimers with the deletion mutant containing the transmembrane domain but not formed with those containing either the cytoplasmic domain (2C) or the extracellular domain (2E) alone (Fig. 1E). To further demonstrate the role of the transmembrane domain in heterodimerization, we used syndecan mutants defective in transmembrane domain-mediated homo-oligomerization (2EPT2C, 4EPT2C, 2GL, or 4GL; see Fig. 1A and Ref. 5Choi S.

Oligomerization-defective mutations abolished SDS-resistant heterodimer formation by syndecan-2 or -4 (Fig. 1F, bottom), supporting the notion that the transmembrane domain is crucial for SDS-resistant heterodimerization of syndecans.

The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (CFZ) has been used as an effective therapy for multiple myeloma via the inhibition of pathologic bone destruction. However, the effect of combination of PTH and CFZ on osteoclastogenesis is unknown. We now report that CFZ inhibits PTH-induced RANKL expression and secretion without affecting PTH inhibition of OPG expression, and it does so by blocking HDAC4 proteasomal degradation in osteoblasts. Furthermore, we used different types of culture systems, including co-culture, indirect co-culture, and transactivation, to assess the effect of CFZ on PTH action to induce osteoclastogenesis. Our results demonstrated that CFZ blocks PTH-induced osteoclast formation and bone resorption by its additional effect to inhibit RANKL-mediated IκB degradation and NF-κB activation in osteoclasts. This study showed for the first time that CFZ targets both osteoblasts and osteoclasts to suppress PTH-induced osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. These findings warrant further investigation of this novel combination in animal models of osteoporosis and in patients.

Here, we showed for the first time the application of LPSpa as an effective mucosal adjuvant for activating vaccine-induced antigen specific immune responses. Mice sublingually immunized with influenza vaccine (HA split vaccine) with LPSpa induced both HA-specific IgG (systemic) and IgA (mucosal) antibody responses, which led to a significant increase in survival rate against lethal influenza virus challenge compared with subcutaneous vaccination. After sublingual administration of ovalbumin with LPSpa, ovalbumin-specific mucosal IgA responses were induced at both mucosal surfaces close to the immunized site and at remote mucosal surfaces. Sublingual administration of LPSpa evoked local antigen-uptake by dendritic cells in cervical lymph nodes. LPSpa induced cytokine production and the maturation and proliferation of innate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 in dendritic cells. Collectively, these results suggest that LPSpa can be used as an effective mucosal adjuvant to stimulate and activate local innate immune cells to improve and enhance mucosal vaccine potency against various pathogens."

P. gingivalis has recently been described as a keystone pathogen for its ability to induce dysbiosis by targeting the host complement cascade, evading immune clearance and promoting destructive periodontal inflammation (20Hajishengallis G.

Major virulence factors produced by P. gingivalis are the trypsin-like cysteine proteinases called gingipains (22Imamura T. The role of gingipains in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.J. Periodontol. 2003; 74: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The gingipains comprise the arginine-specific (RgpA and RgpB) and the lysine-specific (Kgp) proteinases based on their ability to cleave Arg-Xaa or Lys-Xaa peptide bonds, respectively (22Imamura T. The role of gingipains in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.J. Periodontol. 2003; 74: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). RgpA and Kgp form an extracellular cysteine protease complex (RgpA-Kgp complex) common to all characterized P. gingivalis strains and is a major factor contributing to its pathogenicity (23Rajapakse P.S.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 3980-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of the gingipains enables P. gingivalis to degrade a range of host proteins including cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-12, and IFNγ), cell surface receptors (e.g. CD2, CD4, and CD14) and matrix proteins (e.g. fibrin, fibrinogen) (25Bostanci N. Belibasakis G.N. Porphyromonas gingivalis: an invasive and evasive opportunistic oral pathogen.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2012; 333: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The peptides produced from such breakdown provide P. gingivalis with the nutrients it requires for growth and survival (18Lamont R.J. Jenkinson H.F. Life below the gum line: pathogenic mechanisms of Porphyromonas gingivalis.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1244-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Not only do the gingipains degrade host proteins, they also activate host systems, most notably the complement cascade, which enables P. gingivalis to subvert the host immune response and drive PD (20Hajishengallis G.

However, the role of uPA in PD has not been defined. We recently found that uPA−/− mice are resistant to experimental PD following oral infection with P. gingivalis, possibly via a macrophage-dependent mechanism(s) (29Lam R.S. O'Brien-Simpson N.M.

Reactions were terminated by 5× SDS sample buffer and heating to 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen), and uPA was detected with an anti-human uPA mAb (clone U-16) by Western blotting. Alternatively, human pro-uPA (4.5 μm) was incubated with plasmin (50 nm) or RgpA-Kgp complex (50 nm) at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated by 5× SDS and heated to 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with proteins bands visualized with EzBlue gel staining reagent (Sigma).

Proteins were identified by MS/MS Ion Search using Mascot v 2.2 (Matrix Science) against the SwissProt database (June 2014) with taxonomy restricted to Homo sapiens. Search parameters were: enzyme = trypsin (with results of semi-trypsin search also checked); missed cleavages = 3; fixed modifications = carbamidomethyl (Cys); optional modifications = acetyl (Lys), acetyl (N terminus), and oxidation (Met); MS tolerance = 1.5 Da; and MS/MS tolerance = 0.5 Da. For pro-uPA activation: 0.6 mm chromogenic uPA substrate (S2444), 50 nm human pro-uPA, 10 nm human plasmin, 10 nm RgpA-Kgp complex were mixed in assay buffer (0.5 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) in the presence or absence of human PAI-1 (100 nm) or α2-antiplasmin (100 nm) as indicated. The dose-dependent activation of human pro-uPA (50 nm) by plasmin (25 to 0.1 nm) and RgpA-Kgp complex (25 to 0.1 nm) was determined at 60 min. Reactions were performed at 37 °C with absorbance measured at 405 nm for 90 min in a Bio-Rad 680 reader. For plasminogen activation: 0.5 mm chromogenic plasmin substrate (S2251), 250 nm human plasminogen, 50 nm human uPA, and 50 nm RgpA-Kgp complex were mixed in assay buffer (as above). Substrate conversion over 180 min was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. The dose-dependent activation of plasminogen (250 nm) by uPA (125 nm to 0.5 nm) and RgpA-Kgp complex (125 to 0.5 nm) was determined at 120 min.

Briefly, 12 mice (wild-type and uPA−/− C57BL/6 mice) per group were treated with kanamycin (Sigma) at 1 mg/ml for 7 days followed by a 3-day antibiotic-free period. Oral inoculation on days 0 and 20 with each regime consisting of four doses of P. gingivalis W50 (1.0 × 1010 viable P. gingivalis W50 cells suspended in 2% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose vehicle (Sigma)), given 2 days apart.

Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using unpaired Student's t test (GraphPad Prism 4 software). p values ≤0.05 indicate significance. The data were plotted using GraphPad Prism 4.03 software. The data for alveolar bone resorption (mm2) were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, with a Dunnett's T post hoc test. Oral inoculation of uPA−/− mice with P. gingivalis failed to induce significant alveolar bone loss (p < 0.001; Fig. 1A) in contrast to wild-type mice, which developed significant bone loss relative to uninoculated mice. Also uPA−/− mice had lower levels of P. gingivalis in the subgingival plaque compared with wild-type mice (data not shown), suggesting that uPA is necessary for the emergence of the pathogen (29Lam R.S.

Characterization of these MPs is often performed by flow cytometry but there is no consensus on the appropriate negative control to use that can lead to false positive results.We analyzed MPs from platelets, B-cells, T-cells, NK-cells, monocytes, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells. Cells were purified by positive magnetic-separation and cultured for 48h. Cells and MPs were characterized using the following monoclonal antibodies (CD19,20 for B-cells, CD3,8,5,27 for T-cells, CD16,56 for NK-cells, CD14,11c for monocytes, CD41,61 for platelets). Isolated MPs were stained with annexin-V-FITC and gated between 300nm and 900nm. The latex bead technique was then performed for easy detection of MPs. Samples were analyzed by Transmission (TEM) and Scanning Electron microscopy (SEM).Annexin-V positive events within a gate of 300-900nm were detected and defined as MPs. Our results confirmed that the characteristic antigens CD41/CD61 were found on platelet-derived-MPs validating our technique. However, for MPs derived from other cell types, we were unable to detect any antigen, although they were clearly expressed on the MP-producing cells in the contrary of several data published in the literature. Using the latex bead technique, we confirmed detection of CD41,61. However, the apparent expression of other antigens (already deemed positive in several studies) was determined to be false positive, indicated by negative controls (same labeling was used on MPs from different origins).We observed that mother cell antigens were not always detected on corresponding MPs by direct flow cytometry or latex bead cytometry. Our data highlighted that false positive results could be generated due to antibody aspecificity and that phenotypic characterization of MPs is a difficult field requiring the use of several negative controls."

ROS regulation is therefore of key importance. Several polyphenols in general and flavonoids in particular have the potential to generate hydroxyl radicals, the most hazardous among all ROS. However, the generation of a hydroxyl radical and subsequent ROS formation can be prevented by methylation of the hydroxyl group of the flavonoids. O-Methylation is performed by O-methyltransferases, members of the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-dependent O-methyltransferase superfamily involved in the secondary metabolism of many species across all kingdoms. In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, a well established aging model, the O-methyltransferase (PaMTH1) was reported to accumulate in total and mitochondrial protein extracts during aging. In vitro functional studies revealed flavonoids and in particular myricetin as its potential substrate. The molecular architecture of PaMTH1 and the mechanism of the methyl transfer reaction remain unknown. Here, we report the crystal structures of PaMTH1 apoenzyme, PaMTH1-SAM (co-factor), and PaMTH1-S-adenosyl homocysteine (by-product) co-complexes refined to 2.0, 1.9, and 1.9 Å, respectively. PaMTH1 forms a tight dimer through swapping of the N termini. Each monomer adopts the Rossmann fold typical for many SAM-binding methyltransferases. Structural comparisons between different O-methyltransferases reveal a strikingly similar co-factor binding pocket but differences in the substrate binding pocket, indicating specific molecular determinants required for substrate selection. Furthermore, using NMR, mass spectrometry, and site-directed active site mutagenesis, we show that PaMTH1 catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group from SAM to one hydroxyl group of the myricetin in a cation-dependent manner.

https://openalex.org/W347528597,"Dairy cows mobilize large amounts of body fat during early lactation to overcome negative energy balance which typically arises in this period. As an adaptation process, adipose tissues of cows undergo extensive remodeling during late pregnancy and early lactation. The objective of the present study was to characterize this remodeling to get a better understanding of adaptation processes in adipose tissues, affected by changing metabolic conditions including lipid mobilization and refilling as a function of energy status. This was done by determining adipocyte size in histological sections of subcutaneous and retroperitoneal adipose tissue biopsy samples collected from German Holstein cows at 42 days prepartum, and 1, 21, and 100 days postpartum. Characterization of cell size changes was extended by the analysis of DNA, triacylglycerol, and protein content per gram tissue, and β-actin protein expression in the same samples. In both adipose tissue depots cell size was becoming smaller during the course of the study, suggesting a decrease in cellular triacylglycerol content. Results of DNA, triacylglycerol, and protein content, and β-actin protein expression could only partially explain the observed differences in cell size. The retroperitoneal adipose tissue exhibited a greater extent of time-related differences in cell size, DNA, and protein content, suggesting greater dynamics and metabolic flexibility for this abdominal depot compared to the investigated subcutaneous depot."
https://openalex.org/W1572396863,"Gα subunits are central molecular switches in cells. They are activated by G protein-coupled receptors that exchange GDP for GTP, similar to small GTPase activation mechanisms. Gα subunits are turned off by GTP hydrolysis. For the first time we employed time-resolved FTIR difference spectroscopy to investigate the molecular reaction mechanisms of Gαi1. FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool that monitors reactions label free with high spatio-temporal resolution. In contrast to common multiple turnover assays, FTIR spectroscopy depicts the single turnover GTPase reaction without nucleotide exchange/Mg2+ binding bias. Global fit analysis resulted in one apparent rate constant of 0.02 s−1 at 15 °C. Isotopic labeling was applied to assign the individual phosphate vibrations for α-, β-, and γ-GTP (1243, 1224, and 1156 cm−1, respectively), α- and β-GDP (1214 and 1134/1103 cm−1, respectively), and free phosphate (1078/991 cm−1). In contrast to Ras·GAP catalysis, the bond breakage of the β-γ-phosphate but not the Pi release is rate-limiting in the GTPase reaction. Complementary common GTPase assays were used. Reversed phase HPLC provided multiple turnover rates and tryptophan fluorescence provided nucleotide exchange rates. Experiments were complemented by molecular dynamics simulations. This broad approach provided detailed insights at atomic resolution and allows now to identify key residues of Gαi1 in GTP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange. Mutants of the intrinsic arginine finger (Gαi1-R178S) affected exclusively the hydrolysis reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2254828394,"The formation of bacterial spores is a highly regulated process and the ultimate properties of the spores are determined during sporulation and subsequent maturation. A wide variety of genes that are expressed during sporulation determine spore properties such as resistance to heat and other adverse environmental conditions, dormancy and germination responses. In this study we characterized the sporulation phases of C. perfringens enterotoxic strain SM101 based on morphological characteristics, biomass accumulation (OD600), the total viable counts of cells plus spores, the viable count of heat resistant spores alone, the pH of the supernatant, enterotoxin production and dipicolinic acid accumulation. Subsequently, whole-genome expression profiling during key phases of the sporulation process was performed using DNA microarrays, and genes were clustered based on their time-course expression profiles during sporulation. The majority of previously characterized C. perfringens germination genes showed upregulated expression profiles in time during sporulation and belonged to two main clusters of genes. These clusters with up-regulated genes contained a large number of C. perfringens genes which are homologs of Bacillus genes with roles in sporulation and germination; this study therefore suggests that those homologs are functional in C. perfringens. A comprehensive homology search revealed that approximately half of the upregulated genes in the two clusters are conserved within a broad range of sporeforming Firmicutes. Another 30% of upregulated genes in the two clusters were found only in Clostridium species, while the remaining 20% appeared to be specific for C. perfringens. These newly identified genes may add to the repertoire of genes with roles in sporulation and determining spore properties including germination behavior. Their exact roles remain to be elucidated in future studies."

We hypothesized that rats with MetaS would have dysregulated inflammation, increased lung injury, and less effective antibacterial defenses during Staphylococcus (S.) aureus sepsis as compared to rats without MetaS. Low capacity runner (LCR; a model of MetaS) and high capacity runner (HCR) rats were challenged intravenously with S. aureus bacteria. After 48 h, inflammatory mediators and bacteria were quantified in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and lung homogenates. Lungs were analyzed histologically. BALF protein and lung wet-dry ratios were quantified to assess for vascular leak. Endpoints were compared in infected LCR vs HCR rats. LCR rats had higher blood and lung S. aureus counts, as well as higher levels of IL-6 in plasma, lungs and BALF, MIP-2 in plasma and lung, and IL-17A in lungs. Conversely, LCR rats had lower levels of IL-10 in plasma and lungs. Although lactate levels, and liver and renal function tests were similar between groups, LCR rats had higher BALF protein and lung wet-dry ratios, and more pronounced acute lung injury histologically. During S. aureus bacteremia, as compared with HCR rats, LCR (MetaS) rats have heightened pro-inflammatory responses, accompanied by increased acute lung injury and vascular leak. Notably, despite an augmented pro-inflammatory phenotype, LCR rats have higher bacterial levels in their blood and lungs. The MetaS state may exacerbate lung injury and vascular leak by attenuating the inflammation-resolving response, and by weakening antimicrobial defenses."

To monitor the safety and health of the elderly population, we propose a novel omni-directional vision sensor based system, which can detect and track object motion, recognize human posture, and analyze human behavior automatically. In this work, we have made the following contributions: (1) we develop a remote safety monitoring system which can provide real-time and automatic health care for the elderly persons and (2) we design a novel motion history or energy images based algorithm for motion object tracking. Our system can accurately and efficiently collect, analyze, and transfer elderly activity information and provide health care in real-time.

Moreover, for the human posture recognition application, the success rate can reach 98.6% on average."
https://openalex.org/W2165709656,"We test whether there is an own-age advantage in emotion recognition using prototypical younger child, older child and adult faces displaying emotional expressions. Prototypes were created by averaging photographs of individuals from 6 different age and sex categories (male 5-8 years, male 9-12 years, female 5-8 years, female 9-12 years, adult male and adult female), each posing 6 basic emotional expressions. In the study 5-8 year old children (n = 33), 9-13 year old children (n = 70) and adults (n = 92) labelled these expression prototypes in a 6-alternative forced-choice task. There was no evidence that children or adults recognised expressions better on faces from their own age group. Instead, child facial expression prototypes were recognised as accurately as adult expression prototypes by all age groups. This suggests there is no substantial own-age advantage in children's emotion recognition."
https://openalex.org/W336482628,"The serglycin proteoglycan is mainly expressed by hematopoietic cells where the major function is to retain the content of storage granules and vesicles. In recent years, expression of serglycin has also been found in different forms of human malignancies and a high serglycin expression level has been correlated with a more migratory and invasive phenotype in the case of breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Serglycin has also been implicated in the development of the tumor vasculature in multiple myeloma and hepatocellular carcinoma where reduced expression of serglycin was correlated with a less extensive vasculature. To further investigate the contribution of serglycin to tumor development, we have used the immunocompetent RIP1-Tag2 mouse model of spontaneous insulinoma formation crossed into serglycin deficient mice. For the first time we show that serglycin-deficiency affects orthotopic primary tumor growth and tumor vascular functionality of late stage carcinomas. RIP1-Tag2 mice that lack serglycin develop larger tumors with a higher proliferative activity but unaltered apoptosis compared to normal RIP1-Tag2 mice. The absence of serglycin also enhances the tumor vessel functionality, which is better perfused than in tumors from serglycin wild type mice. The presence of the pro-angiogenic modulators vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor were decreased in the serglycin deficient mice which suggests a less pro-angiogenic environment in the tumors of these animals. Taken together, we conclude that serglycin affects multiple aspects of spontaneous tumor formation, which strengthens the theory that serglycin acts as an important mediator in the formation and progression of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W293032946,"Coptotermes formosanus is an imported, subterranean termite species with the largest economic impact in the United States. The frontal glands of the soldier caste termites comprising one third of the body mass, contain a secretion expelled through a foramen in defense. The small molecule composition of the frontal gland secretion is well-characterized, but the proteins remain to be identified. Herein is reported the structure and function of one of several proteins found in the termite defense gland secretion. TFP4 is a 6.9 kDa, non-classical group 1 Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor with activity towards chymotrypsin and elastase, but not trypsin. The 3-dimensional solution structure of TFP4 was solved with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and represents the first structure from the taxonomic family, Rhinotermitidae. Based on the structure of TFP4, the protease inhibitor active loop (Cys(8) to Cys(16)) was identified."
https://openalex.org/W406511693,"While the association between cigarette smoking and abdominal fat has been well studied in normal and overweight patients, data regarding the influence of tobacco use in patients with morbid obesity remain scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate body fat distribution in morbidly obese smokers.We employed a cross-sectional study and grouped severely obese patients (body mass index [BMI] >40 kg/m2 or >35 kg/m2 with comorbidities) according to their smoking habits (smokers or non-smokers). We next compared the anthropometrical measurements and body composition data (measured by electric bioimpedance) of both groups. We analyzed the effect of smoking on body composition variables using univariate and multiple linear regression (MLR); differences are presented as regression coefficients (b) and their respective 95% confidence intervals.We included 536 morbidly obese individuals, 453 (84.5%) non-smokers and 83 (15.5%) smokers. Male smokers had a higher BMI (b=3.28 kg/m2, p=0.036), larger waist circumference (b=6.07 cm, p=0.041) and higher percentage of body fat (b=2.33%, p=0.050) than non-smokers. These differences remained significant even after controlling for confounding factors. For females, the only significant finding in MLR was a greater muscle mass among smokers (b=1.34kg, p=0.028). No associations were found between tobacco load measured in pack-years and anthropometric measures or body composition.Positive associations between smoking and BMI, and waist circumference and percentage of body fat, were found among male morbidly obese patients, but not among females. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first investigation of these aspects in morbidly obese subjects. We speculate that our findings may indicate that the coexistence of morbid obesity and smoking helps to explain the more serious medical conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, seen in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W1481294095,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants, and many are potent carcinogens. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), one of the best-studied PAHs, is metabolized ultimately to the genotoxin anti-B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE). BPDE triggers stress responses linked to gene expression, cell death and survival. So far, the underlying mechanisms that initiate these signal transduction cascades are unknown. Here we show that BPDE-induced DNA damage is recognized by DNA damage sensor proteins to induce activation of the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) p38. Surprisingly, the classical DNA damage response, which involves the kinases ATM and ATR, is not involved in p38-SAPK activation by BPDE. Moreover, the induction of p38-SAPK phosphorylation also occurs in the absence of DNA strand breaks. Instead, increased phosphorylation of p38-SAPK requires the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and DNA damage sensor proteins XPC and mHR23B. Interestingly, other genotoxins such as cisplatin (CDDP), hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet radiation also enhance XPC-dependent p38-SAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, anti-benzo[c]phenanthrene-3,4-dihydrodiol-1,2-epoxide, the DNA adducts of which are not properly recognized by NER, does not trigger p38-SAPK activation. As a downstream consequence, expression and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 is induced by BPDE and CDDP in vitro and by CDDP in the murine lung, and depends on XPC. In conclusion, we describe a novel pathway in which DNA damage recognition by NER proteins specifically leads to activation of p38-SAPK to promote inflammatory gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2213844946,"In vivo intracellular responses to auditory stimuli revealed that, in a particular population of cells of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) of rats, fast inhibition occurred before the first action potential. These experimental data were used to constrain a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model of the neurons in this circuit. The post-synaptic potentials of the VNLL cell population were characterized using a method of triggered averaging. Analysis suggested that these inhibited VNLL cells produce action potentials in response to a particular magnitude of the rate of change of their membrane potential. The LIF model was modified to incorporate the VNLL cells' distinctive action potential production mechanism. The model was used to explore the response of the population of VNLL cells to simple speech-like sounds. These sounds consisted of a simple tone modulated by a saw tooth with exponential decays, similar to glottal pulses that are the repeated impulses seen in vocalizations. It was found that the harmonic component of the sound was enhanced in the VNLL cell population when compared to a population of auditory nerve fibers. This was because the broadband onset noise, also termed spectral splatter, was suppressed by the fast onset inhibition. This mechanism has the potential to greatly improve the clarity of the representation of the harmonic content of certain kinds of natural sounds."
https://openalex.org/W1595711463,"Psychophysiological markers have been focused to investigate the psychopathology of psychiatric disorders and personality subtypes. In order to understand neurobiological mechanisms underlying these conditions, fear-conditioning model has been widely used. However, simple aversive stimuli are too simplistic to understand mechanisms because most patients with psychiatric disorders are affected by social stressors. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of a newly-designed conditioning experiment using a stimulus to cause interpersonal conflicts and examine associations between personality traits and response to that stimulus. Twenty-nine healthy individuals underwent the fear conditioning and extinction experiments in response to three types of stimuli: a simple aversive sound, disgusting pictures, and pictures of an actors’ face with unpleasant verbal messages that were designed to cause interpersonal conflicts. Conditioned response was quantified by the skin conductance response (SCR). Correlations between the SCR changes, and personality traits measured by the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD) and Revised NEO Personality Inventory were explored. The interpersonal conflict stimulus resulted in successful conditioning, which was subsequently extinguished, in a similar manner as the other two stimuli. Moreover, a greater degree of conditioned response to the interpersonal conflict stimulus correlated with a higher ZAN-BPD total score. Fear conditioning and extinction can be successfully achieved, using interpersonal conflicts as a stimulus. Given that conditioned fear caused by the interpersonal conflicts is likely associated with borderline personality traits, this paradigm could contribute to further understanding of underlying mechanisms of interpersonal fear implicated in borderline personality disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1573596533,"Genome-wide mapping of transcriptional regulatory elements is an essential tool for understanding the molecular events orchestrating self-renewal, commitment and differentiation of stem cells. We combined high-throughput identification of transcription start sites with genome-wide profiling of histones modifications to map active promoters and enhancers in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) induced to neuroepithelial-like stem cells (NESCs). Our analysis showed that most promoters are active in both cell types while approximately half of the enhancers are cell-specific and account for most of the epigenetic changes occurring during neural induction, and most likely for the modulation of the promoters to generate cell-specific gene expression programs. Interestingly, the majority of the promoters activated or up-regulated during neural induction have a ""bivalent"" histone modification signature in ESCs, suggesting that developmentally-regulated promoters are already poised for transcription in ESCs, which are apparently pre-committed to neuroectodermal differentiation. Overall, our study provides a collection of differentially used enhancers, promoters, transcription starts sites, protein-coding and non-coding RNAs in human ESCs and ESC-derived NESCs, and a broad, genome-wide description of promoter and enhancer usage and of gene expression programs characterizing the transition from a pluripotent to a neural-restricted cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W216054243,"Ecosystem distributions are expected to shift as a result of global warming, raising concerns about the long-term utility of reserve systems based on coarse-filter ecosystem representation. We tested the extent to which proportional ecosystem representation targets would be maintained under a changing climate by projecting the distribution of the major ecosystems of Alberta, Canada, into the future using bioclimatic envelope models and then calculating the composition of reserves in successive periods. We used the Marxan conservation planning software to generate the suite of reserve systems for our test, varying the representation target and degree of reserve clumping. Our climate envelope projections for the 2080s indicate that virtually all reserves will, in time, be comprised of different ecosystem types than today. Nevertheless, our proportional targets for ecosystem representation were maintained across all time periods, with only minor exceptions. We hypothesize that this stability in representation arises because ecosystems may be serving as proxies for land facets, the stable abiotic landscape features that delineate major arenas of biological activity. The implication is that accommodating climate change may not require abandoning the conventional ecosystem-based approach to reserve design in favour of a strictly abiotic approach, since the two approaches may be largely synonymous."
https://openalex.org/W1554968455,"The c-type cytochromes are electron transfer proteins involved in energy transduction. They have heme-binding (CXXCH) sites that covalently ligate heme b via thioether bonds and are classified into different classes based on their protein folds and the locations and properties of their cofactors. Rhodobacter capsulatus produces various c-type cytochromes using the cytochrome c maturation (Ccm) System I, formed from the CcmABCDEFGHI proteins. CcmI, a component of the heme ligation complex CcmFHI, interacts with the heme-handling protein CcmE and chaperones apocytochrome c2 by binding its C-terminal helix. Whether CcmI also chaperones other c-type apocytochromes, and the effects of heme on these interactions were unknown previously. Here, we purified different classes of soluble and membrane-bound c-type apocytochromes (class I, c2 and c1, and class II c') and investigated their interactions with CcmI and apoCcmE. We report that, in the absence of heme, CcmI and apoCcmE recognized different classes of c-type apocytochromes with different affinities (nM to μM KD values). When present, heme induced conformational changes in class I apocytochromes (e.g. c2) and decreased significantly their high affinity for CcmI. Knowing that CcmI does not interact with mature cytochrome c2 and that heme converts apocytochrome c2 into its b-type derivative, these findings indicate that CcmI holds the class I apocytochromes (e.g. c2) tightly until their noncovalent heme-containing b-type cytochrome-like intermediates are formed. We propose that these intermediates are subsequently converted into mature cytochromes following the covalent ligation of heme via the remaining components of the Ccm complex."
