https://openalex.org/W2070426326,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for conserved viral antigens can respond to different strains of virus, in contrast to antibodies, which are generally strain-specific. The generation of such CTLs in vivo usually requires endogenous expression of the antigen, as occurs in the case of virus infection. To generate a viral antigen for presentation to the immune system without the limitations of direct peptide delivery or viral vectors, plasmid DNA encoding influenza A nucleoprotein was injected into the quadriceps of BALB/c mice. This resulted in the generation of nucleoprotein-specific CTLs and protection from a subsequent challenge with a heterologous strain of influenza A virus, as measured by decreased viral lung titers, inhibition of mass loss, and increased survival."

https://openalex.org/W2089262366,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a pleiotrophic cytokine with immunomodulatory effects on a variety of immune cells. Mice with a targeted disruption of the IFN-gamma gene were generated. These mice developed normally and were healthy in the absence of pathogens. However, mice deficient in IFN-gamma had impaired production of macrophage antimicrobial products and reduced expression of macrophage major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. IFN-gamma-deficient mice were killed by a sublethal dose of the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium bovis. Splenocytes exhibited uncontrolled proliferation in response to mitogen and alloantigen. After a mixed lymphocyte reaction, T cell cytolytic activity was enhanced against allogeneic target cells. Resting splenic natural killer cell activity was reduced in IFN-gamma-deficient mice. Thus, IFN-gamma is essential for the function of several cell types of the murine immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2017729786,"Sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation have been implicated in a signal transduction pathway that mediates the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other agents on cell growth and differentiation. In many leukemic cells, TNF-α causes DNA fragmentation, which leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). C2-ceramide (0.6 to 5 μM), a synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analog, induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which was inhibited by zinc ion. Other amphiphilic lipids failed to induce apoptosis. The closely related C2-dihydroceramide was also ineffective, which suggests a critical role for the sphingolipid double bond. The effects of C2-ceramide on DNA fragmentation were prevented by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which suggests the existence of two opposing intracellular pathways in the regulation of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068871282,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) exerts pleiotropic effects, including antiviral activity, stimulation of macrophages and natural killer cells, and increased expression of major histocompatibility complex antigens. Mice without the IFN-gamma receptor had no overt anomalies, and their immune system appeared to develop normally. However, mutant mice had a defective natural resistance, they had increased susceptibility to infection by Listeria monocytogenes and vaccinia virus despite normal cytotoxic and T helper cell responses. Immunoglobulin isotype analysis revealed that IFN-gamma is necessary for a normal antigen-specific immunoglobulin G2a response. These mutant mice offer the possibility for the further elucidation of IFN-gamma-mediated functions by transgenic cell- or tissue-specific reconstitution of a functional receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1979581724,"The eukaryotic cell exhibits compartmentalization of functions to various membrane-bound organelles and to specific domains within each membrane. The spatial distribution of the membrane chemoreceptors and associated cytoplasmic chemotaxis proteins in Escherichia coli were examined as a prototypic functional aggregate in bacterial cells. Bacterial chemotaxis involves a phospho-relay system brought about by ligand association with a membrane receptor, culminating in a switch in the direction of flagellar rotation. The transduction of the chemotaxis signal is initiated by a chemoreceptor-CheW-CheA ternary complex at the inner membrane. These ternary complexes aggregate predominantly at the cell poles. Polar localization of the cytoplasmic CheA and CheW proteins is dependent on membrane-bound chemoreceptor. Chemoreceptors are not confined to the cell poles in strains lacking both CheA and CheW. The chemoreceptor-CheW binary complex is polarly localized in the absence of CheA, whereas the chemoreceptor-CheA binary complex is not confined to the cell poles in strains lacking CheW. The subcellular localization of the chemotaxis proteins may reflect a general mechanism by which the bacterial cell sequesters different regions of the cell for specialized functions."
https://openalex.org/W2050256171,"Heparin or heparin-like heparan sulfate proteoglycans are obligatory for activity of the heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. Heparin interacts independently of FGF ligand with a specific sequence (K18K) in one of the immunoglobulin-like loops in the extracellular domain of the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase transmembrane glycoprotein. A synthetic peptide corresponding to K18K inhibited heparin and heparin-dependent FGF binding to the receptor. K18K and an antibody to K18K were antagonists of FGF-stimulated cell growth. Point mutations of lysine residues in the K18K sequence abrogated both heparin- and ligand-binding activities of the receptor kinase. The results indicate that the FGF receptor is a ternary complex of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, tyrosine kinase transmembrane glycoprotein, and ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1992857468,"It has long been thought that hair cell loss from the inner ears of mammals is irreversible. This report presents scanning electron micrographs and thin sections of the utricles from the inner ears of guinea pigs that show that, after hair cell loss caused by treatment with the aminoglycoside gentamicin, hair cells reappeared. Four weeks after the end of treatment, a large number of cells with immature hair bundles in multiple stages of development could be identified in the utricle. Thin sections showed that lost type 1 hair cells were replaced by cells with a morphology similar to that of type 2 hair cells. These results indicate an unexpected capacity for hair cell regeneration in vivo in the mature mammalian inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W1995048201,"Supporting cells in the vestibular sensory epithelia from the ears of mature guinea pigs and adult humans proliferate in vitro after treatments with aminoglycoside antibiotics that cause sensory hair cells to die. After 4 weeks in culture, the epithelia contained new cells with some characteristics of immature hair cells. These findings are in contrast to expectations based on previous studies, which had suggested that hair cell loss is irreversible in mammals. The loss of hair cells is responsible for hearing and balance deficits that affect millions of people."

https://openalex.org/W2016770416,"Neurons maintain their electrical activity patterns despite channel turnover, cell growth, and variable extracellular conditions. A model is presented in which maximal conductances of ionic currents depend on the intracellular concentration of calcium ions and so, indirectly, on activity. Model neurons with activity-dependent maximal conductances modify their conductances to maintain a given behavior when perturbed. Moreover, neurons that are described by identical sets of equations can develop different properties in response to different patterns of presynaptic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2093339251,"PU.1 recruits the binding of a second B cell-restricted nuclear factor, NF-EM5, to a DNA site in the immunoglobulin kappa 3' enhancer. DNA binding by NF-EM5 requires a protein-protein interaction with PU.1 and specific DNA contacts. Dephosphorylated PU.1 bound to DNA but did not interact with NF-EM5. Analysis of serine-to-alanine mutations in PU.1 indicated that serine 148 (Ser148) is required for protein-protein interaction. PU.1 produced in bacteria did not interact with NF-EM5. Phosphorylation of bacterially produced PU.1 by purified casein kinase II modified it to a form that interacted with NF-EM5 and that recruited NF-EM5 to bind to DNA. Phosphopeptide analysis of bacterially produced PU.1 suggested that Ser148 is phosphorylated by casein kinase II. This site is also phosphorylated in vivo. Expression of wild-type PU.1 increased expression of a reporter construct containing the PU.1 and NF-EM5 binding sites nearly sixfold, whereas the Ser148 mutant form only weakly activated transcription. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation of PU.1 at Ser148 is necessary for interaction with NF-EM5 and suggest that this phosphorylation can regulate transcriptional activity."

https://openalex.org/W1984120373,"Immunization with a phosphonate monoester transition-state analog of cocaine provided monoclonal antibodies capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of the cocaine benzoyl ester group. An assay for the degradation of radiolabeled cocaine identified active enzymes. Benzoyl esterolysis yields ecgonine methyl ester and benzoic acid, fragments devoid of cocaine's stimulant activity. Passive immunization with such an artificial enzyme could provide a treatment for dependence by blunting reinforcement."

https://openalex.org/W2048007683,"The bacterium Caulobacter crescentus yields two different progeny at each cell division; a chemotactically competent swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell. The chemotaxis proteins are synthesized in the predivisional cell and then partition only to the swarmer cell upon division. The chemoreceptors that were newly synthesized were located at the nascent swarmer pole of the predivisional cell, an indication that asymmetry was established prior to cell division. When the swarmer cell differentiated into a stalked cell, the chemoreceptor was specifically degraded by virtue of an amino acid sequence located at its carboxyl terminus. Thus, a temporally and spatially restricted proteolytic event was a component of this differentiation process."

https://openalex.org/W1983302698,"The unfertilized eggs of vertebrates are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II because of the activity of cytostatic factor (CSF). Xenopus CSF is thought to contain the product of the Mos proto-oncogene, but other proteins synthesized during meiosis II are also required for arrest induced by CSF. In Xenopus oocytes, ablation of synthesis of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) during meiosis resulted in absence of the metaphase II block, even though the Mosxe protein kinase was fully active at metaphase. Introduction of purified Cdk2 restored metaphase II arrest, and increasing the amount of Cdk2 during meiosis I (when Mosxe is present) led to metaphase arrest at meiosis I. These data indicate that metaphase arrest is a result of cooperation between a proto-oncogene kinase and a cyclin-dependent kinase and illustrate the interaction of a cell growth regulator with a cell cycle control element."

https://openalex.org/W1966166239,"The platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3 binds to fibrinogen and thus mediates platelet aggregation after stimulation. This integrin was isolated from human platelets and reconstituted into lipid vesicles. As judged by electron microscopy the integrin incorporated adequately only into 1,2-dimyristoylglycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidy lglycerol vesicles after removal of the detergent by adsorption to Bio-Beads. These vesicles were then used to generate planar lipid bilayers. The binding of fluorochrome labeled fibrinogen or the peptide ligand Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro-Cys (GRGDSPC) was monitored by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a solid phase binding assay. Analysis of the kinetics revealed fast reversible formation of a fibrinogen/integrin precomplex (KD = 50 nM) followed by formation of a stable irreversible complex. This transition was monitored by measuring the fraction of precomplex which could be dissociated by addition of excess Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS). For the peptide, the KD was 1200 nM, and the rates of association and dissociation were faster than the time resolution of the method. Similar KD values were found by inhibition of fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 in the immobilized receptor assay. Since the binding of fibrinogen was irreversible, KD values were dependent on the time period between fibrinogen incubation and peptide addition. These and results by other authors point to the biological importance of the biphasic binding process of fibrinogen to its receptor on platelets."

https://openalex.org/W2079714787,"After synthesis, the α chain of the T cell antigen receptor (TCRα) can form a complex with other TCR chains and move to the cell surface, or TCRα can undergo degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) if it remains unassembled. The mechanism of translocation and degradation in the ER is unclear. It was found that the putative transmembrane region of TCRα (αtm) was incompetent on its own to act as a transmembrane region. Molecules that contained αtm were translocated into the ER lumen and then underwent either rapid degradation or secretion, depending on the sequence of the cytoplasmic domain. A specific signal for ER degradation within αtm does not appear to be present."
https://openalex.org/W1537719134,"Synaptotagmin I is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein that binds Ca2+ in a phospholipid-dependent manner and is thought to function in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We have now studied the phosphorylation of synaptotagmin I. Synaptotagmin I is one of the major substrates in brain for casein kinase II, which phosphorylates synaptotagmin at a single threonine. The phosphorylation site was mapped using recombinant proteins to threonine 128 of synaptotagmin I, which is located in the sequence between the transmembrane region and the C2 domain repeats of synaptotagmin I. The phosphorylation site of synaptotagmin I is also present in synaptotagmin II and is evolutionarily conserved between different species. Preceding the phosphorylation site, synaptotagmins I and II contain a lysine-rich sequence. Casein kinase II phosphorylation of many substrates is strongly stimulated by the addition of polylysine, but phosphorylation of synaptotagmin I by casein kinase II is not. In recombinant proteins, removal of the lysine-rich sequence of synaptotagmin I makes its phosphorylation dependent on exogenous polylysine, suggesting that the lysine-rich sequence in synaptotagmin serves as an endogenous polylysine stimulation signal for casein kinase II. Our data demonstrate that synaptotagmin I is an efficient substrate for casein kinase II at a conserved site with a possible modulatory role in nerve terminal function."

https://openalex.org/W1531375840,"O-linked glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of apolipoproteins, but no structural or functional role for it has been identified. We examined the biosynthesis of apolipoprotein (apo) A-II in Hep G2 cells and in glycosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants transfected with apoA-II cDNA. Three monomeric isoforms of apoA-II with an apparent molecular mass of 8.5, 9.8, and 11.4 kDa were synthesized by Hep G2 cells and transfected wild-type CHO cells. The 9.8- and 11.4-kDa isoforms were sialylated but not the 8.5-kDa isoform. Transfected 1dlD cells, which are defective in the biosynthesis of galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, only produced the 8.5-kDa isoform; however, when grown in media supplemented with these sugars, ldlD cells produced all three isoforms of apoA-II. Pulse-chase analysis of ldlD cells showed that glycosylation was not necessary for secretion of apoA-II. Glycosylation did modify the association of apoA-II with nascent high density lipoprotein (HDL) secreted by Hep G2 cells. The sialylated isoforms were lipid-poor and were present in the lipoprotein-deficient density range, whereas the nonsialylated 8.5-kDa isoform was associated with LpA-I, A-II lipoprotein particles in the HDL density range. ApoA-II from transfected ldlD cells, regardless of glycosylation, were lipid-poor. When preincubated with HDL from serum, however, sialylated apoA-II from both ldlD cells and Hep G2 cells associated with lipoprotein particles within the HDL3 density, whereas nonsialylated apoA-II was found throughout the HDL density range. In summary, O-linked glycosylation is not necessary for the secretion of apoA-II but does modify the association of apoA-II to HDL and may, therefore, play an important role in the metabolism of HDL."
https://openalex.org/W1532686067,"alpha A-crystallin is an abundant soluble protein of the vertebrate eye lens. In addition to the TATA box, four positive cis-regulatory elements of the chicken alpha A-crystallin gene have been identified by linker scanning mutagenesis, DNase I footprinting, and gel mobility shift experiments. The regulatory elements described here have been named DE2A (at positions -144 to -134), DE2B (at positions -128 to -118), and DE1A (at positions -114 to -103). DE2A and DE2B form a dyad of symmetry between positions -141 and -118 (5‘-AGACTGTCAT....AGGTCAGTCT-3‘), consistent with the close similarity in the mobility of complexes formed with lens nuclear proteins by these two elements. Mutations in DE2A, DE2B, and DE1A leading to loss of promoter activity using the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene transfected into primary embryonic chicken lens epithelial cells resulted in a corresponding loss in the ability to compete for complex formation with lens nuclear proteins in gel mobility shift assays. Mutation of the alpha A-CRYBP1-like site (-67/-57), necessary for function of the mouse alpha A-crystallin promoter, did not affect the activity of the chicken promoter. The DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift experiments confirmed the previously noted binding of nuclear proteins to a dyad of symmetry at positions -153 to -140. In contrast to DE2A, DE2B, and DE1A, mutagenesis and gel mobility shift experiments failed to correlate function and protein binding for the -153/-140 dyad. DE2A, DE2B, and DE1A agree well with the regulatory elements alpha CE1 (-162/-134), alpha CE3 (-135/-121), and alpha CE2 (-119/-99) (Matsuo, I., and Yasuda, K. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20, 3701-3712) for this gene. The present results suggest, however, that the lens enhancer activity of alpha CE1 is due to the sequence -141/-134, which forms the upper half of the DE2A/DE2B dyad of symmetry, rather than the -153/-140 dyad as previously suspected."
https://openalex.org/W1526570214,"Abstract C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prototypic acute phase protein in human and rabbit. Although it is structurally and functionally conserved from invertebrate to human, there are species-specific differences in patterns of expression and putative function. To further investigate the biological significance, regulation, and evolution of CRP, we isolated Xenopus CRP and subsequently derived and sequenced corresponding cDNA and the genomic clones. The structure and expression of Xenopus CRP were also compared to those of the other CRPs. Analyses of the amino acid sequence and the nucleotide sequence reveal that the mature Xenopus CRP is a 222-amino acid protein preceded by a 16-residue signal peptide. During development, Xenopus CRP is expressed, only when the liver appears, and therefore is not likely to play a role in early embryonic development. Compared to other species, Xenopus CRP is present at an intermediate low level of < 1 microgram/ml in the normal serum. Unlike human and rabbit CRP, Xenopus CRP is not induced by turpentine or heatshock treatment. The heatshock consensus sequence (Woo, P., Korenberg, J. R., and Whitehead, A. S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4136-4142) are not present in the Xenopus CRP gene. It is suggested that Xenopus CRP represents a transitional period in CRP evolution when host defenses switched from primitive innate immunity to a much more complex immune system. The constitutive functions of CRP gradually became less essential as the result of the development of a complex immune system."

https://openalex.org/W1573962600,"The possibility that low circulating levels of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (A1Pi) in individuals homozygous for the S variant result from disruption of a salt bridge between Glu264 and Lys387 was examined. Mutations effecting this salt bridge were constructed by either altering the common M variant cDNA so that Glu264 was replaced by Val to produce the S variant (A1PiV264) or Lys387 was replaced by Arg (A1PiR387), Asn (A1PiN387), Glu (A1PiE387), Gly (A1PiG387), Ile (A1PiI387), or Leu (A1PiL387). Measurements of secretion from transiently transfected COS cells showed that A1PiG387 and A1PiI387 are secreted as well as and at least as rapidly as A1PiM; the S variant and A1PiL387 are secreted to about the same extent as, but somewhat more slowly, than A1PiM; and the variants containing polar or charged residues at position 387 are poorly secreted, and unlike the other variants in this series undergo significant degradation by 2 h of chase. We conclude that the low circulating level of A1PiS is not due to inefficient secretion nor to excessive intracellular degradation of this variant. In addition we suspect that the lack of secretion of variants with Lys387 replaced by other charged or polar residues is due to alteration of a highly conserved sequence near the carboxyl terminus of A1Pi."
