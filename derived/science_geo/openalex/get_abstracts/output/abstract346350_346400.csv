Here, we show that FFAs can cause activation of RAW264.7 cells primarily via the JNK signaling cascade and that TLR2 and TLR4 are upstream of JNK and help transduce FFA proinflammatory signals. We also demonstrate that F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) have heightened proinflammatory activity compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c− bone marrow-derived macrophages and that the proinflammatory activity and JNK phosphorylation of BMDCs, but not bone marrow-derived macrophages, was further increased by FFA treatment. F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells were found in AT, and the proportion and number of these cells in AT is increased in ob/ob mice and by feeding wild type mice a high fat diet for 1 and 12 weeks. AT F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells express increased inflammatory markers compared with F4/80+CD11b+CD11c− cells, and FFA treatment increased inflammatory responses in these cells. In addition, we found that CD11c expression is increased in skeletal muscle of high fat diet-fed mice and that conditioned medium from FFA-treated wild type BMDCs, but not TLR2/4 DKO BMDCs, can induce insulin resistance in L6 myotubes. Together our results show that FFAs can activate CD11c+ myeloid proinflammatory cells via TLR2/4 and JNK signaling pathways, thereby promoting inflammation and subsequent cellular insulin resistance.

A definitive role for immune cells in metabolic dysregulation was recently demonstrated in mice with myeloid cell-specific knock-out of IKKβ (9Arkan M.C. Hevener A.L. Greten F.R. Maeda S. Li Z.W. Long J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Poli G. Olefsky J. Karin M. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar), indicating that macrophage activation can cause systemic insulin resistance. Macrophages are a heterogeneous population of phagocytic cells found throughout the body that originate from the mononuclear phagocytic system (10Mantovani A. Sica A. Locati M. Immunity. 2005; 23: 344-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). These are highly plastic cells that arise from circulating myeloid-derived blood monocytes that have entered target tissues and gained the phenotypic and functional attributes of their tissue of residence. Like for other immune cells, the distribution and function of tissue macrophages have been largely characterized using monoclonal antibodies to cell surface proteins. In mice, the most commonly used monocyte/macrophage and myeloid cell surface markers are F4/80 and CD11b, although F4/80 and CD11b antibodies have been reported to react with eosinophils and dendritic cells and NK and other T and B cell subtypes, respectively (11Lai L. Alaverdi N. Maltais L. Morse H.C.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3861-3868PubMed Google Scholar). In AT, resident macrophages are surrounded by adipocytes that constantly release free fatty acids (FFAs) via lipolysis. FFAs thus have the potential to activate AT macrophages and consequently alter their function. FFAs can cause activation of JNK and IKKβ inflammatory pathways in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle (1Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E.

In man, elevated FFA levels are a feature of obesity and type 2 diabetes (12Wellen K.E. Hotamisligil G.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (3247) Google Scholar, 14Boden G. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2002; 5: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In animal models, high fat (HF) feeding and direct lipid infusion can increase plasma FFA levels and cause tissue and systemic inflammation and insulin resistance (15Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J. Ye J.M.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are thought to participate in sensing extracellular FFAs. TLRs belong to the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor superfamily and are widely expressed on cells of the immune system (17Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar, 18Liew F.Y. Xu D. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). TLRs recognize bacteria-associated molecular patterns with high specificity, and TLR-mediated signal transduction leads to the activation of JNK and NFκB signaling pathways (17Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar, 19Guha M. Mackman N. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), initiating the innate immune response. The saturated FA, lauric acid, was shown to activate TLR2 in 293T cells as well as NFκB-mediated, TLR4-dependent signaling pathways in RAW264.7 cells (20Lee J.Y. Zhao L. Youn H.S. Weatherill A.R. Tapping R. Feng L. Lee W.H. Fitzgerald K.A. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16971-16979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Similarly, an oleate/palmitate mixture can induce NFκB-dependent TLR4 signaling in 293T cells and cause inflammation in wild type (WT) but not TLR4-deficient adipocytes. The saturated FA palmitate was also shown to cause TLR4-dependent IκBα degradation in elicited peritoneal macrophages (21Shi H. Kokoeva M.V. Inouye K. Tzameli I. Yin H. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3015-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the effects of saturated and unsaturated FFAs in cultured RAW264.7 cells, primary bone marrow (BM)-derived cells and adipose tissue macrophages. We demonstrate that FFAs signal through both TLR2 and TLR4 to activate JNK and stimulate inflammatory pathways in CD11c+ myeloid cells. We also show that in AT, F4/80+CD11b+CD11c+ cells are the direct targets for FFAs and that HF feeding increases the number of these cells in AT. As such, these results provide a novel mechanistic link between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Reagents—Antibodies to IL-6, MCP-1,TNF-α, and horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and all other antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen and Hyclone (Logan, UT). Cell Culture and Treatment—Mouse monocyte/macrophage RAW264.7 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% low endotoxin FBS. In pretreated cells, 1 μm rosiglitazone or vehicle Me2SO was added at least 24 h prior to FFA treatment. RAW cells were then incubated for 3 h with either 500 μm of an FFA mixture containing equimolar amounts of tissue culture-grade arachidonic, lauric, linoleic, oleic, and myristic acids or with individual FFAs (500 μm) or ethanol vehicle in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with FFA-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich). All of the FFA solutions were pre-equilibrated with BSA at 37 °C for 1-1.5 h (22Spector A.A. John K. Fletcher J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 56-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a 5:1 FFA:BSA ratio was used to simulate elevated FFAs levels. We ensured that all components for cell culture and treatment experiments contained very low or undetectable amounts of contaminating lipopolysaccharide by measuring endotoxin levels in the serum, culture medium, BSA preparation, and FFA stock solutions (LAL assay kit, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). All of the solutions used contained undetectable amounts of endotoxin except for the BSA solution, which contained 0.3 EU/ml (0.03 ng/ml) of endotoxin. This amount of contaminating lipopolysaccharide was not sufficient to activate RAW264.7 cells and BMDCs. We found that treating RAW264.7 cells and BMDCs with 0.03 ng/ml of endotoxin for 3 h did not cause phosphorylation of JNK and secretion of TNF-α and JNK phosphorylation in these cells (data not shown). Western Blotting—The cells were lysed in cold buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EDTA. Whole cell lysates (25 μg) or conditioned medium (30 μl) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Following blocking with 5% milk in TBST, the membranes were probed with primary antibodies as indicated and subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies for chemiluminescent detection (Pierce). The blots were stripped in Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) and reprobed as necessary. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated and purified using RNeasy columns and RNase-free DNase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). One-step RT-PCR kits (Qiagen) and sequence-specific primers (see supplemental Fig. S3) were used to generate RT-PCR products, which were then run on 8% acrylamide gels, stained with ethidium bromide, visualized, and quantitated using the Kodak ID Imaging station and software (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT). Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells as outlined above. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Super-Script III and random hexamers (Invitrogen). The samples were run in 20-μl reactions using an AB1 7300 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); SYBR Green oligonucleotides were used for detection, and sequence-specific primers are listed in supplemental Fig. S3. Gene expression levels were calculated after normalization to the standard housekeeping gene GAPDH using the ΔΔCT method as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) and expressed as relative mRNA levels compared with control. ELISA—Conditioned medium was assayed for mouse IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α using ELISA kits (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein Knockdown—2 × 107 RAW264.7 cells were electroporated with 2.5 nmol of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified siRNA oligonucleotides (IDT, Coralville, IA) to mouse JNK1, JNK2, p65-NFκB, TLR2, or TLR4 or with luciferase control siRNA (oligonucleotide sequences in supplemental Fig. S3) using the XCell Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cells were plated into 24-well tissue culture plates, and 24-48 h post-electroporation, they were treated with FFAs as described above. Conditioned medium and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Isolation and Treatment of Bone Marrow-derived Cells—All of the animal experiments were performed humanely under protocols approved by the University of California, San Diego. TLR2/4 DKO male mice on a C57BL/6 background (kindly provided by Dr. Shizuo Akira, University of Osaka, Japan) and WT C57BL/6 male mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs and tibias of 10-12-week-old homozygous and WT mice by flushing the medullary cavity with RPMI medium. After washing, the cells were seeded in tissue culture plates and differentiated into either bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in RPMI medium containing 30% of L-929 conditioned medium or 10 or 40 ng/ml of recombinant GM-CSF, respectively, and supplemented with 20% low endotoxin FBS and streptomycin/penicillin. We observed that differentiating precursor cells in 40 ng/ml of GM-CSF yielded more BMDCs than when using 10 ng/ml of GM-CSF. However, this higher GM-CSF concentration did not affect BMDC proinflammatory gene expression (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and COX-2), differentiation and cell surface antigen expression (F4/80, CD11b, and CD11c), as determined by qPCR and FACS analysis (data not shown). We were also able to differentiate BMDMs from bone marrow precursor cells using murine recombinant M-CSF (data not shown). BMDM and BMDC differentiation was complete 8 days after cell plating; this was confirmed by the expression of F4/80, a marker preferentially expressed by mature macrophages, and of CD11c, a cell surface marker for dendritic cells, using FACS (data not shown). For FFA experiments, day 8 or 9 BMDMs and BMDCs were stimulated with 500 μm FFA for 3 h, and conditioned medium and cell lysates were analyzed as indicated. Immunohistocytochemistry—Paraffin-embedded adipose tissue was sectioned, deparaffinized, and rehydrated prior to endogenous peroxidase and biotin removal using 0.03% H2O2 and 0.1% avidin. The slides were heated in 0.1 m citrate buffer for antigen retrieval, cooled, washed, and then blocked with 1% BSA in TBST. The sections were incubated overnight with CD11c primary antibody (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Biotin-conjugated secondary and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin tertiary antibodies were applied for detection, and the sections were developed in substrate chromogen, counterstained in Mayers Hematoxylin, and mounted in Gelmount Biomedia. Frozen quad muscle tissue was sectioned (5 um), air-dried, and fixed in acetone. After endogenous peroxidase removal using 0.03% H2O2, the sections were washed in PBS and blocked in 0.01% biotin for 15 min and then in 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Biotin-conjugated CD11c antibody was overlaid for 1 h, and the sections were further processed as outlined above. Animal Studies—Wild type male C57BL/6 and ob/obJ male mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and given free access to food and water. C57BL/6 mice were placed on a HFD consisting of 40% of calories from fat (TD.96132; Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) starting at 12 weeks of age for 1, 12, or 20 weeks. Control C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard diet with 12% of calories from fat (LabDiet, 5001; Richmond, IN). The body weights and food intakes were recorded every week (data not shown). An insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed on mice after 1 and 12 weeks of chow or HFD feeding. The mice were fasted for 6 h. After 4 h of fasting, basal plasma glucose was measured. At 6 h, the mice were injected intraperitoneal with 0.6 units of insulin/kg of body weight. Blood glucose was measured through the tail tip at the indicated times, using a OneTouch glucose-monitoring system (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) Isolation and FACS Analysis—Epididymal fat pads were excised from male C57BL/6 mice fed normal chow (NC) or HFD, weighed, rinsed three times in PBS, and then minced in FACS buffer (PBS + 1% low endotoxin BSA). Tissue suspensions were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and then collagenase-treated (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking. The cell suspensions were filtered through a 100-μm filter and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. SVF pellets were then incubated with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience) for 5 min prior to centrifugation (300 × g for 5 min) and resuspension in FACS buffer. Stromal vascular cells (SVCs) were incubated with Fc Block (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 20 min at 4 °C prior to staining with fluorescently labeled primary antibodies or control IgGs for 25 min at 4 °C. F4/80-allophycocyanin FACS antibody was purchased from AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC); all other fluorescein isothiocyanate- and phycoerythrin-conjugated FACS antibodies were from BD Biosciences. The cells were gently washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). SVCs were analyzed using FACSCalibur and FACSAria flow cytometers (BD Biosciences). Unstained, single stains, and fluorescence minus one controls were used for setting compensation and gates. Forcellsorting,F4/80+CD11b+CD11c−andF4/80+CD11b+-CD11c+ cells from lean, NC SVFs were sorted into FBS. Sorted cells were allowed to recover for 2 h. The cells were then washed and treated with FFA for subsequent RNA extraction and real time PCR analysis. Glucose Uptake Assay—BMDCs from WT and TLR2/4 DKO mice were treated with 500 μm FFA or vehicle for 3 h and then washed twice with RPMI medium to remove the FFAs. The cells were subsequently incubated with fresh culture medium containing 2% FBS. After 6 h of incubation, CM was harvested for ELISA analysis and co-culture experiments. L6 myocytes were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS and differentiated into myotubes in α-minimal essential medium containing 2% FBS for ∼6-7 days. The L6 myotube culture medium was then replaced with CM from BMDCs diluted 1:1 in fresh L6 differentiation medium. L6 myotubes were incubated with BMDC-derived CM for 24-48 h prior to assaying glucose uptake. For glucose uptake assays, L6 myotubes were serum starved for 3 h in α-minimal essential medium with 0.5% FFA-free BSA and then glucose-starved for 30 min in HEPES salt buffer containing 0.5% FFA-free BSA. The cells were stimulated with insulin (5 nm) at 37 °C for 20 min; tracer glucose was then added for 10 min. After 30 min of insulin stimulation, glucose uptake was assayed in quadruplicate wells for each condition using 1,2-3H-2-deoxy-d-glucose (0.2 μCi, 0.1 mm, 10 min) in four independent experiments. Data Analysis—Densitometric quantification and normalization were performed using the NIH Image 1.63 software. The values presented are expressed as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance of the differences between various treatments was determined by one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction. FFAs Cause a Proinflammatory Response in RAW264.7 Cells—Recent studies suggest that chronic inflammation in AT is an important mechanism underlying the insulin resistance associated with obesity, HF feeding, and diabetes and that infiltrating macrophages may be responsible for the activation of proinflammatory pathways (6Bouloumie A. Curat C.A. Sengenes C. Lolmede K. Miranville A. Busse R. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2005; 8: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 23Kolb H. Mandrup-Poulsen T. Diabetologia. 2005; 48: 1038-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Because FFAs are released in AT, we studied the effects of FFAs on AT macrophage function. We first treated RAW264.7 murine monocyte/macrophage cells with a mixture of saturated and unsaturated FFAs and surveyed various stress/inflammatory signaling responses. FFA treatment broadly activated the JNK and IKKβ signaling pathways (Fig. 1A), in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with JNK activation being observed as early as 5 min after FFA treatment (data not shown). After washing to remove FFAs, followed by a 12-h recovery period, inflammatory markers returned to base-line levels, and the cells were once again responsive to lipopolysaccharide stimulation (data not shown). Thus, the proinflammatory effects of FFAs were specific and reversible and did not result from cell toxicity. When the cells were treated with 500 μm FFA for 3 h, we observed induction of the proinflammatory genes IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and MMP-9, an increase in intracellular MCP-1 and TNF-α levels, and an increase in secreted proinflammatory chemo/cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-α (supplemental Fig. S1, A-C). When we tested individual FAs, each FA in the mixture, except for myristic acid, was able to activate the proinflammatory kinase pathways in RAW264.7 cells and increased intracellular and secreted TNF-α levels, albeit to different degrees (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). Overall, the unsaturated FA arachidonic acid was most potent in causing these effects. We assessed whether a TZD, rosiglitazone, could inhibit FFA-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 cells and found that all the FFA-induced effects were attenuated by pretreatment with rosiglitazone (supplemental Fig. S2, A-C). Contribution of JNK and IKKβ-NFκB to the FFA Proinflammatory Effects—Previous reports have documented that FFAs induce mostly NFκB-dependent effects, and we observed that FFA treatment activated both JNK and IKKβ signaling pathways. Therefore, we assessed the contribution of these two kinases to the overall FFA effect using siRNAs targeted specifically against JNK1, JNK2, and p65-NFκB. JNK1 and JNK2 siRNAs decreased levels of both JNK protein isoforms by >70% (13Nguyen M.T. Satoh H. Favelyukis S. Babendure J.L. Imamura T. Sbodio J.I. Zalevsky J. Dahiyat B.I. Chi N.W. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35361-35371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and p65-NFκB siRNA decreased p65 protein levels by ∼75% (Fig. 1B). JNK knockdown (KD) significantly reduced basal MMP-9, IL-1β, TNF-α, and COX-2 gene expression levels, and inhibited the FFA-induced up-regulation in IL-1β and MMP-9 gene expression (Fig. 1C). In contrast, knocking down p65 produced smaller inhibitory effects on gene expression. Moreover, JNK KD resulted in decreased FFA-induced intracellular and secreted TNF-α levels (Fig. 1D), whereas p65 KD, while having the expected effect to decrease phosphorylation of NFκB, had little or no effect on intracellular and secreted TNF-α (Fig. 1E). This suggested that JNK plays a more central role in mediating the FFA-induced proinflammatory effects in RAW264.7 cells. We thus focused on examining the role of JNK kinase in mediating the effects of FFAs. TLR2 and TLR4 Mediate FA Signaling in RAW264.7 Cells—TLRs are expressed on monocytes and macrophages, and it has been reported that bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which contains an FA moiety, can induce proinflammatory effects through TLR4 (17Takeda K. Akira S. Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar, 24Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6514) Google Scholar, 25Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that TLR4, and possibly TLR2, another member of the TLR family, could mediate the FFA proinflammatory signals. To test this idea, siRNAs were used to knockdown TLR4 and TLR2 proteins in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2A), achieving ∼50% and ∼75% KD efficiency for TLR2 and TLR4, respectively (bar graph in Fig. 2A). TLR2 KD significantly reduced basal expression of MMP-9, IL-1β, and TNF-α genes, whereas TLR4 KD reduced the basal expression of these genes and that of COX-2 (Fig. 2B). TLR2 and TLR4 KD also inhibited the FFA-induced up-regulation in IL-1β and MMP-9 gene expression. Fig. 2C shows that in the TLR2 KD cells, FFA-induced JNK phosphorylation was inhibited, as was the increase in intracellular and secreted TNF-α levels. When TLR4 was depleted, these proinflammatory responses were also inhibited, but to a greater extent (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that both TLR4 and TLR2 play a role in mediating FA signaling via JNK activation. Studies in Bone Marrow-derived Cells—RAW264.7 cells have been extensively used as a model cell line for studies of macrophage biology. We found that RAW264.7 cells express high levels of the macrophage and myeloid cell surface markers F4/80 and CD11b but also high levels of a cell surface marker more typical of dendritic and T cells, CD11c (data not shown). With this in mind, and given the heterogeneity and plasticity of the macrophage population, we further examined the effects of FFAs in two types of primary myeloid-derived cell types: BMDMs, which express F4/80, CD11b but not CD11c, and BMDCs, which express all three markers. BMDMs and BMDCs were prepared as described in detail under “Experimental Procedures.” According to previously established methods, the phenotype of these primary cells was confirmed by FACS using fluorescently labeled antibodies showing that BMDMs express F4/80 and CD11b, whereas BMDCs are positive for F4/80, CD11b, and CD11c (data not shown). To characterize these two cell types, we examined the expression of inflammatory genes by qPCR (Fig. 3A). The relative expression of COX-2, CCR2, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α genes was strikingly higher in BMDCs than BMDMs (p < 0.05 or less), suggesting that BMDCs possess greater proinflammatory activity than BMDMs. Consistent with this, BMDMs expressed high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas BMDCs exhibited no detectable levels of IL-10. BMDMs and BMDCs have been shown to express TLR2 and TLR4. Because BMDCs have heightened proinflammatory activity and because FFAs exert their inflammat"

https://openalex.org/W2067148460,"New data from the orbiting Chandra X-ray observatory reveal that the X-ray hot spots in the shell of supernova remnant SNR RX J1713.7-3946 undergo brightening and decay on a one-year timescale. This supernova remnant is unusual in that its X-ray emissions are largely non-thermal in origin. The rapid variability points to ultrarelativistic electrons acting via a synchrotron process as the probable X-ray source. All this adds up to unexpectedly rapid cosmic-ray acceleration in a magnetic field amplified by a factor of more than 100. A discovery of the brightening and decay of X-ray hot spots in the shell of the SNR RX J1713.˜73946 on a one-year timescale is reported. This rapid variability shows that the X-rays are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons through a synchrotron process. Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are widely believed to be accelerated by shock waves associated with the expansion of supernova ejecta into the interstellar medium1. A key issue in this long-standing conjecture is a theoretical prediction that the interstellar magnetic field can be substantially amplified at the shock of a young supernova remnant (SNR) through magnetohydrodynamic waves generated by cosmic rays2,3. Here we report a discovery of the brightening and decay of X-ray hot spots in the shell of the SNR RX J1713.7-3946 on a one-year timescale. This rapid variability shows that the X-rays are produced by ultrarelativistic electrons through a synchrotron process and that electron acceleration does indeed take place in a strongly magnetized environment, indicating amplification of the magnetic field by a factor of more than 100. The X-ray variability also implies that we have witnessed the ongoing shock-acceleration of electrons in real time. Independently, broadband X-ray spectrometric measurements4 of RX J1713.7-3946 indicate that electron acceleration proceeds in the most effective (‘Bohm-diffusion’) regime. Taken together, these two results provide a strong argument for acceleration of protons and nuclei to energies of 1 PeV (1015 eV) and beyond in young supernova remnants."
https://openalex.org/W2058021161,"It is becoming increasingly clear that the autonomic nervous system and the immune system demonstrate cross-talk during inflammation by means of sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways. We investigated whether phagocytes are capable of de novo production of catecholamines, suggesting an autocrine/paracrine self-regulatory mechanism by catecholamines during inflammation, as has been described for lymphocytes. Here we show that exposure of phagocytes to lipopolysaccharide led to a release of catecholamines and an induction of catecholamine-generating and degrading enzymes, indicating the presence of the complete intracellular machinery for the generation, release and inactivation of catecholamines. To assess the importance of these findings in vivo, we chose two models of acute lung injury. Blockade of alpha2-adrenoreceptors or catecholamine-generating enzymes greatly suppressed lung inflammation, whereas the opposite was the case either for an alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist or for inhibition of catecholamine-degrading enzymes. We were able to exclude T cells or sympathetic nerve endings as sources of the injury-modulating catecholamines. Our studies identify phagocytes as a new source of catecholamines, which enhance the inflammatory response."

https://openalex.org/W2134462999,"Understanding how complex food webs assemble through time is fundamental both for ecological theory and for the development of sustainable strategies of ecosystem conservation and restoration. The build-up of complexity in communities is theoretically difficult, because in random-pattern models complexity leads to instability. There is growing evidence, however, that nonrandom patterns in the strengths of the interactions between predators and prey strongly enhance system stability. Here we show how such patterns explain stability in naturally assembling communities. We present two series of below-ground food webs along natural productivity gradients in vegetation successions. The complexity of the food webs increased along the gradients. The stability of the food webs was captured by measuring the weight of feedback loops of three interacting 'species' locked in omnivory. Low predator-prey biomass ratios in these omnivorous loops were shown to have a crucial role in preserving stability as productivity and complexity increased during succession. Our results show the build-up of food-web complexity in natural productivity gradients and pin down the feedback loops that govern the stability of whole webs. They show that it is the heaviest three-link feedback loop in a network of predator-prey effects that limits its stability. Because the weight of these feedback loops is kept relatively low by the biomass build-up in the successional process, complexity does not lead to instability."

Recent progress in this area has opened up exciting possibilities for exploring fundamental physics as well as applications in quantum information technology; in a series of experiments it was shown that such circuits can be exploited to generate quantum optical phenomena, by designing superconducting elements as artificial atoms that are coupled coherently to the photon field of a resonator. Here we demonstrate a lasing effect with a single artificial atom--a Josephson-junction charge qubit--embedded in a superconducting resonator. We make use of one of the properties of solid-state artificial atoms, namely that they are strongly and controllably coupled to the resonator modes. The device is essentially different from existing lasers and masers; one and the same artificial atom excited by current injection produces many photons."

https://openalex.org/W2074755764,"Background Probabilistic functional gene networks are powerful theoretical frameworks for integrating heterogeneous functional genomics and proteomics data into objective models of cellular systems. Such networks provide syntheses of millions of discrete experimental observations, spanning DNA microarray experiments, physical protein interactions, genetic interactions, and comparative genomics; the resulting networks can then be easily applied to generate testable hypotheses regarding specific gene functions and associations. Methodology/Principal Findings We report a significantly improved version (v. 2) of a probabilistic functional gene network [1] of the baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We describe our optimization methods and illustrate their effects in three major areas: the reduction of functional bias in network training reference sets, the application of a probabilistic model for calculating confidences in pair-wise protein physical or genetic interactions, and the introduction of simple thresholds that eliminate many false positive mRNA co-expression relationships. Using the network, we predict and experimentally verify the function of the yeast RNA binding protein Puf6 in 60S ribosomal subunit biogenesis. Conclusions/Significance YeastNet v. 2, constructed using these optimizations together with additional data, shows significant reduction in bias and improvements in precision and recall, in total covering 102,803 linkages among 5,483 yeast proteins (95% of the validated proteome).

https://openalex.org/W2000350349,"Xanthophylls (oxygenated carotenoids) are essential components of the plant photosynthetic apparatus, where they act in photosystem assembly, light harvesting, and photoprotection. Nevertheless, the specific function of individual xanthophyll species awaits complete elucidation. In this work, we analyze the photosynthetic phenotypes of two newly isolated Arabidopsis mutants in carotenoid biosynthesis containing exclusively α-branch (chy1chy2lut5) or β-branch (chy1chy2lut2) xanthophylls. Both mutants show complete lack of qE, the rapidly reversible component of nonphotochemical quenching, and high levels of photoinhibition and lipid peroxidation under photooxidative stress. Both mutants are much more photosensitive than npq1lut2, which contains high levels of viola- and neoxanthin and a higher stoichiometry of light-harvesting proteins with respect to photosystem II core complexes, suggesting that the content in light-harvesting complexes plays an important role in photoprotection. In addition, chy1chy2lut5, which has lutein as the only xanthophyll, shows unprecedented photosensitivity even in low light conditions, reduced electron transport rate, enhanced photobleaching of isolated LHCII complexes, and a selective loss of CP26 with respect to chy1chy2lut2, highlighting a specific role of β-branch xanthophylls in photoprotection and in qE mechanism. The stronger photosystem II photoinhibition of both mutants correlates with the higher rate of singlet oxygen production from thylakoids and isolated light-harvesting complexes, whereas carotenoid composition of photosystem II core complex was not influential. In depth analysis of the mutant phenotypes suggests that α-branch (lutein) and β-branch (zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin) xanthophylls have distinct and complementary roles in antenna protein assembly and in the mechanisms of photoprotection.

Carotenoids are a group of C40 terpenoid compounds with a wide distribution in several biological taxa, ranging from archaea to bacteria, fungi, algae, and higher plants. Xanthophylls form a subgroup of oxygenated carotenoids, whose importance in the oxygenic photosynthesis is well known. Xanthophylls play essential roles in higher plant photosynthesis, as components of the photosynthetic apparatus of the chloroplast. In higher plants, β-carotene binds to reaction center subunits of both photosystem I (PSI) 4The abbreviations used are: PSI and PSII, photosystems I and II, respectively; 1O2, singlet oxygen; ABA, abscisic acid; α- and β-DM, n-dodecyl-α-d-maltoside and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, respectively; Chl a and b, chlorophyll a and b, respectively; 3Chl*, triplet excited state of chlorophyll; ETR, electron transport rate; Lhca and Lhcb, light-harvesting complexes of photosystems I and II, respectively; LHCI, antenna complex of photosystem I; LHCII, major light-harvesting complex of PSII; Lute, lutein; MDA, malondialdehyde; Neo, neoxanthin; NPQ, nonphotochemical quenching; qE, ΔpH-dependent component of NPQ; qI, photoinhibition quenching; qP, photochemical quenching; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOSG, singlet oxygen sensor green; Viola, violaxanthin; WT, wild type; Zea, zeaxanthin; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and II (PSII), whereas xanthophylls are both accessory pigments and structural elements of light-harvesting complexes (Lhcs). Together with β-carotene, they act both as chromophores, absorbing light energy that is used in photosynthetic electron transport, and as photoprotectants of the photosynthetic apparatus from excess light and from the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated during oxygenic photosynthesis. A remarkable characteristic of higher plant xanthophylls is that they show very similar spectral properties in the visible region. This evidence is apparently incoherent with the high conservation of their relative abundance across a range of plant taxa, which suggests that each xanthophyll species serves a specific role. Xanthophyll biosynthesis in plants is divided into two distinct branches; hydroxylation of α-carotene gives rise to lutein (Lute), the most abundant xanthophyll in leaves (Fig. 1), whereas hydroxylation of β-carotene gives rise to zeaxanthin (Zea). In normal light conditions, zeaxanthin is epoxidized into antheraxanthin and violaxanthin (Viola) (Fig. 1), whereas in excess light, de-epoxidation prevails, leading to the accumulation of Zea (1Yamamoto H.Y. Nakayama T.O. Chichester C.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Demmig-Adams B. Adams W.W. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). LHCII, the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II, binds Lute, Viola, and neoxanthin (Neo) (Fig. 1) (3Liu Z. Yan H. Wang K. Kuang T. Zhang J. Gui L. An X. Chang W. Nature. 2004; 428: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). The minor complexes CP24, CP26, and CP29 bind the same pigments and, in excess light, Zea (4Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J.

The specific function of each xanthophyll species in Lhc complexes is the subject of intense debate; lack of Lute and/or Zea decreases the capacity for photoprotection in high light, as suggested by the photosensitivity of Arabidopsis and Chlamydomonas mutants lacking both xanthophylls (6Gilmore A.M.

Neo has a role in the protection of photosynthetic apparatus by promoting the scavenging of superoxide anions, a ROS formed in the Mehler reaction (20Dall'Osto L. Cazzaniga S. North H. MArion-Poll A. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1048-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The function of Viola is more controversial; it has been suggested to be involved both in the reversion of NPQ (21Gilmore A.M. Mohanty N. Yamamoto H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in chlorophyll (Chl) triplet quenching (22Peterman E.J. Gradinaru C.C. Calkoen F. Borst J.C. van Grondelle R. Van Amerongen H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12208-12215Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that the overaccumulation of Viola increases photoprotection in vivo (23Davison P.A. Hunter C.N. Horton P. Nature. 2002; 418: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cooperative effects on photoprotection by different xanthophyll species have been suggested by early experiments using recombinant Lhc proteins reconstituted with different xanthophylls (24Croce R. Weiss S. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29613-29623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These data suggest that different xanthophyll species may have distinct roles in photoprotection. Nevertheless, the role of β-β-xanthophylls (in particular, Neo and Viola) in the photosynthetic process is not completely understood. The recent elucidation of the higher plant β-ring hydroxylation (25Kim J. DellaPenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3474-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Fiore A. Dall'Osto L. Fraser P.D. Bassi R. Giuliano G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that two different classes of enzymes are involved in hydroxylation of the ϵ- and β-ionone rings of carotenes: ferredoxin-dependent di-iron oxygenases (CHY1 and CHY2), active in β-ring hydroxylation, and cytochromes P450: LUT1, required for ϵ-ring hydroxylation, and LUT5, showing in vivo a major hydroxylation activity on the β-ring of α-carotene as well as minor activity on the β-rings of β-carotene. Plant mutants are now available, specifically lacking xanthophylls in the β-β-branch (Neo, Viola, and Zea) and useful for the analysis of xanthophyll function in photosynthesis. In this work, we compare the photosystem structure and photoprotection properties of two triple mutants containing low levels of xanthophylls but mutually exclusive in composition; chy1chy2lut5 contains only Lute, whereas chy1chy2lut2 contains only β-β-xanthophylls (Neo, Viola, and Zea). We find that Lute alone is unable to provide sufficient levels of photoprotection even in moderate light, thus conferring to the chy1chy2lut5 mutant the highest sensitivity to photooxidation ever described in a xanthophyll mutant. Plant Material—T-DNA insertion mutants were identified in the Syngenta and Salk collections. Individual mutants were crossed, and F1 seeds were grown and self-fertilized to obtain the F2 generation. The genotype of the F2 individuals was checked by PCR using gene-specific primers and T-DNA primers (26Fiore A. Dall'Osto L. Fraser P.D. Bassi R. Giuliano G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All mutants were in the Columbia background and were grown at 22 °C under a photoperiod of 16 h of light (45 μmol m−2 s−1) and 8 h of darkness. In Vivo Fluorescence and NPQ Measurements—Nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, qP (photochemical quenching) and PSII yield (ΦPSII) was measured on whole leaves at room temperature (22 °C) with a PAM 101 fluorimeter (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). Minimum fluorescence (F0) was measured with a 0.15 μmol m−2 s−1 beam, maximum fluorescence (Fm) was determined with a 0.6-s light pulse (4500 μmol m−2 s−1), and white continuous light (1200 μmol m−2 s−1) was supplied by a KL1500 halogen lamp (Schott, Mainz, Germany). NPQ, qP, and relative electron transport rate (ETR) were calculated according to the equation (27Van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar), NPQ = (Fm - F′m)/F′m, qP = (Fm - Fs)/(Fm - Fo), rel ETR =ΦPSII·PAR, where Fm is the maximum Chl fluorescence from dark-adapted leaves, F′m is the maximum Chl fluorescence under actinic light exposition, Fs is the stationary fluorescence during illumination, and PAR is the photosynthetic active radiations (white light, measured as μmol m−2 s−1). Calculation of the ΔpH-dependent component of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (qE) was performed as described previously (28Walters R.G. Horton P. Planta. 1995; 197: 306-312PubMed Google Scholar). Variable fluorescence was induced in leaf discs, infiltrated with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (30 μm), sorbitol (150 mm), with a green light of 7 μmol m−2 s−1 produced by a light-emitting diode. The time corresponding to two-thirds of the fluorescence rise (T⅔)was taken as a measure of the functional antenna size of PSII (29Malkin S. Armond P.A. Mooney H.A. Fork D.C. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 570-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea-treated leaves, the rate of fluorescence rise depends on light intensity and functional antenna size of PSII. Thus, keeping constant the saturating flash intensity, PSII with higher functional antenna size will reduce more rapidly all of the available QA pool and will have a lower T⅔ of fluorescence rise. For measurements of the PSII repair process, whole plants were illuminated at room temperature for 1.5 h to induce 50-60% photoinhibition of PSII (photon flux density of 1800 μmol m−2 s−1 for WT plants, 700 μmol m−2 s−1 for chy1chy2lut5 plants), and restoration of the Fv/Fm ratios was subsequently followed at irradiances of 30 μmol m−2 s−1 at room temperature (30Aro E.M. McCaffery S. Anderson J.M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1033-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Pigment Analysis—Pigments were extracted from dark-adapted leaf discs; samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground in 85% acetone buffered with Na2CO3, and then the supernatant of each sample was recovered after centrifugation (15 min at 15,000 × g, 4 °C); separation and quantification of pigments were performed by HPLC (31Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and by fitting of the spectrum of the acetone extract with spectra of individual pigments (32Croce R. Canino g. Ros F. Bassi R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7334-7343Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thylakoid Isolation and Thylakoid Protein Preparation—Unstacked thylakoids were isolated from leaves as previously described (33Casazza A.P. Tarantino D. Soave C. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 68: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Membranes corresponding to 500 μg of chlorophylls were washed with 5 mm EDTA and then solubilized in 1 ml of 0.6% α-DM) 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Solubilized samples were then fractionated by ultracentrifugation in a 0.1-1 m sucrose gradient containing 0.06% α-DM, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (22 h at 280,000 × g, 4 °C). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE analysis was performed with the Tris-Tricine buffer system as previously described (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). For immunotitration, thylakoid samples corresponding to 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 μg of chlorophylls were loaded for each sample and electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were incubated with antibodies raised against Lhcb1, Lhcb2, Lhcb3, CP29 (Lhcb4), CP26 (Lhcb5), CP24 (Lhcb6), or CP47 (PsbB) and were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody, according to Ref. 35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar. Signal amplitude was quantified using the GelPro 3.2 software (Bio-Rad). Electron Microscopy—Intact leaf fragments from wild-type and mutant 3-week-old leaves were fixed, embedded, and observed in thin section as previously described (36Sbarbati A. Merigo F. Benati D. Tizzano M. Bernardi P. Osculati F. Chem. Senses. 2004; 29: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—Spectra were obtained using samples in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.06% α-DM, 0.2 m sucrose. Absorption measurements were performed using an Aminco DW-2000 spectrophotometer (SLM Instruments, Rochester, NY) at room temperature. Fluorescence emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jobin-Yivon Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter at room temperature. Measure of ΔpH—The kinetics of ΔpH formation across the thylakoid membrane were measured using the method of 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quenching, as previously described (37Evron Y. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 μm 9-aminoacridine. The chlorophyll concentration in the reaction buffer was adjusted to 10 μg/ml. Determination of the Sensitivity to Photooxidative Stress—Photooxidative stress was induced in detached leaves by a strong light treatment at low temperature. Detached leaves on wet filter paper were exposed to high light (1000 μmol m−2 s−1 for 5 h) in a growth chamber at low temperature (10 °C) and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Photoxidative stress was assessed by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) formation, as indirect quantification of lipid peroxidation. MDA is a reactive, low molecular weight aldehyde derived from radical attack of polyunsaturated fatty acids; in our measurement, leaf MDA levels were stabilized through the formation of a colored, thiobarbituric acid adduct. The MDA-(thiobarbituric acid adduct)2 complex was separated from other thiobarbituric acid adducts and quantified by HPLC as previously described (38Havaux M. Eymery F. Porfirova S. Rey P. Dormann P. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3451-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Measurements of Singlet Oxygen Production—Measurements of singlet oxygen (1O2) production either from thylakoids and purified pigment-protein complexes were performed with singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG; Molecular Probes, Eugene). SOSG is a fluorescent probe highly selective for 1O2 that increases its 530 nm emission band in the presence of this ROS (39Flors C. Fryer M.J. Waring J. Reeder B. Bechtold U. Mullineaux P.M. Nonell S. Wilson M.T. Baker N.R. J. Exp. Bot. 2006; 57: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were resuspended in a reaction buffer (0.33 m sorbitol, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 30 mm ascorbate, 100 μm methyl viologen, 2 μm SOSG) at a final Chl concentration of 20 μg/ml and kept under continuous stirring. Pigment-protein complexes were harvested from sucrose gradient and diluted in a reaction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.06% α-DM, 2 μm SOSG) to the same absorption area in the wavelength range 600-750 nm (around 2.2 μg Chls/ml). Thylakoids and isolated complexes were illuminated with red light (λ > 600 nm) for 5 min; fluorescence yields of SOSG (λex 480 nm, λem 530 nm) were determined before and after light treatment in order to quantify 1O2-dependent fluorescence increase. Pigment Composition—Wild type and single and triple mutants chy1chy2lut5 and chy1chy2lut2, described by Fiore et al. (26Fiore A. Dall'Osto L. Fraser P.D. Bassi R. Giuliano G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were grown in low light conditions (45 μmol m−2 s−1) for 3 weeks. None of the single or double mutants displayed a visible phenotype, whereas the triple mutants chy1chy2lut2 and chy1chy2lut5 showed, respectively, paler leaves and a highly retarded growth. Since Viola and Neo are precursors of the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA) (40Milborrow B.V. J. Exp. Bot. 2001; 52: 1145-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of β-β-xanthophylls in chy1chy2lut5 and the concomitant reduction in ABA content could be in principle a cause for some of the chy1chy2lut5 phenotypes. However, chy1chy2lut5 plants sprayed daily with ABA did not show a visible phenotypic reversion (data not shown). This result is in agreement with a recent report showing that ABA deficiency is not responsible for increased photooxidation of thylakoid membranes (20Dall'Osto L. Cazzaniga S. North H. MArion-Poll A. Bassi R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1048-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The lut2 and lut5 mutants were included in this characterization, respectively, as lutein-less and increased α-carotene internal controls, whereas mutants npq1 (16Niyogi K.K. Grossman A.R. Björkman O. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1121-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar) and npq1lut2 (7Niyogi K.K. Shih C. Chow W.S. Pogson B.J. DellaPenna D. Bjorkman O. Photosynth.

The steps affected by the various mutations are described in Fig. 1A, whereas Fig. 1B and Table 1 show the leaf pigment composition of the mutants analyzed (see additional results in supplemental Table a1 for a complete description of leaf pigment composition of all genotypes used in this characterization).TABLE 1Pigment content and photosynthetic parameters Fv/Fm and T⅔ of dark-adapted leaf tissue from wild type and mutant genotypes Parameters were obtained from measurements on the same samples described in the legend to Fig. 1B.

In these conditions, lut2npq1, the most light-sensitive xanthophyll mutant so far described (7Niyogi K.K. Shih C. Chow W.S. Pogson B.J. DellaPenna D. Bjorkman O. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 67: 139-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had an Fv/Fm ratio of 0.8, the same as WT (data not shown). These mutants showed a strong increase in chlorophyll a/b ratios as well as a reduced Chl content per leaf area with respect to WT and lut2 (chy1chy2lut2 (45% reduction) and chy1chy2lut5 (35% reduction) (Table 1)) and a severely reduced xanthophyll content with respect to WT and lut2 plants, the main leaf carotenoids being α- and/or β-carotene (Fig. 1B). β-Carotene normally binds photosynthetic reaction centers and Lhca, whereas α-carotene binds the same sites as β-carotene and is found in shade-adapted plants (42Krause G.H. Koroleva O.Y. Dalling J.W. Winter K. Plant Cell Env. 2001; 24: 1345-1352Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Krause G.H. Grube E. Koroleva O.Y. Barth C. Winter K. Funct. Plant Biol. 2004; 31: 743-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this case, its accumulation is induced by a knock-out mutation in the LUT5 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 carotenoid hydroxylase (25Kim J. DellaPenna D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3474-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 26Fiore A. Dall'Osto L. Fraser P.D. Bassi R. Giuliano G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Both lut2 and lut5 mutations induced a slight increase in the chlorophyll/xanthophyll ratio, which led to a slight decrease in functional antenna size (Table 1). Chlorophyll/xanthophyll ratio was essentially the same in both triple mutants. Still they show distinct compositions of the xanthophyll fraction; Lute is the only oxygenated carotenoid in chy1chy2lut5, whereas chy1chy2lut2 leaves contain Neo, antheraxanthin, Viola, and Zea in approximately equal amounts. lut2 and lut5 had similar functional antenna size, measured from kinetics of fluorescence rise in 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, whereas chy1chy2lut5 antenna size was 57% with respect to WT, and chy1chy2lut2 antenna size was 45% with respect to lut2, consistent with their lower Chl b content (Table 1). Chloroplast Ultrastructure and Pigment-Protein Complex Composition—Carotenoids are important ligand and structural elements of several photosynthetic subunits; thus, changes in thylakoid pigment composition can result in structural modification of photosynthetic membranes as well as in changes of the relative amount of pigment-protein complexes. Electron microscopy analysis was performed to verify if the thylakoid structure was changed as an effect of the different carotenoid composition (Fig. 2A). The mutants showed a membrane organization very similar to that of wild-type chloroplasts. All genotypes formed well defined grana, containing ∼9.1 ± 3.3 (WT, lut5), 8.9 ± 2.5 (chy1chy2lut5), 10.1 ± 3.6 (lut2), 6.9 ± 2.7 (chy1chy2lut2) stacks. Statistical analysis revealed that only the chloroplasts from chy1chy2lut2 plants formed grana with a number of stacks significantly lower with respect to all other genotypes (Student’s t test, p < 0.05, n > 15). One striking observation was the difference in the number of osmiophilic globules found; whereas WT and lut2 showed few of these globular structures (5 ± 3 and 4 ± 2 per chloroplast, respectively), the two triple mutants showed a strongly increased incidence of these structures: 14 ± 5 and 18 ± 6, respectively, for chy1chy2lut5 and chy1chy2lut2. Moreover, these structures were also larger in the latter genotypes. Chlorophyll proteins from wild type, lut2, lut5, chy1chy2lut5, and chy1chy2lut2 were fractionated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2B). The amount of LHCII trimers was found to be roughly proportional to the Lute/chlorophyll ratio, in agreement with previous results (44Lokstein H. Tian L. Polle J.E. DellaPenna D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The chy1chy2lut5 pattern was very similar to that of WT, with abundant LHCII trimers and"

On the other hand, recent studies suggest that SOD1 itself is a major target of oxidative damage and has its own pathogenicity in various neurodegenerative diseases, including familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Only human and great ape SOD1s among mammals have the highly reactive free cysteine residue, Cys111, at the surface of the SOD1 molecule. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Cys111 in the oxidative damage of the SOD1 protein, by comparing the oxidative susceptibility of recombinant human SOD1 modified with 2-mercaptoethanol at Cys111 (2-ME-SOD1) to wild-type SOD1. Wild-type SOD1 was more sensitive to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide-generating fragments, oligomers, and charge isomers compared with 2-ME-SOD1. Moreover, wild-type SOD1, but not 2-ME-SOD1, generated an upper shifted band in reducing SDS-PAGE even by air oxidation. Using mass spectrometry and limited proteolysis, this upper band was identified as an oxidized subunit of SOD1; the sulfhydryl group (Cys-SH) of Cys111 was selectively oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) and to cysteine sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H). The antibody raised against a synthesized peptide containing Cys111-SO3H reacted with only the Cys111-peroxidized SOD1 by Western blot analysis and labeled Lewy body-like hyaline inclusions and vacuole rims in the spinal cord of human SOD1-mutated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice by immunohistochemical analysis.

(SOD1) is a homodimer containing one copper ion and one zinc ion in each 16-kDa subunit. SOD1 catalyzes the conversion of superoxide anion ( (O2−)) into O2 and H2O2, thereby protecting cells against oxidative stress. On the other hand, SOD1 exhibits peroxidase activity and oxidizes various substrates in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 (1Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although H2O2 is a substrate as well as a product of SOD1, incubation of bovine SOD1 with H2O2 caused oxidation of His118 (corresponding to His120 in human SOD1) to 2-oxohistidines, inactivating the enzyme (2Uchida K. Kawakishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2405-2410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, incubation with excess H2O2 caused oxidation of almost all histidine and cysteine residues (3Kurahashi T. Miyazaki A. Suwan S. Isobe M. J. Am. Chem.

The familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with specific mutations in the SOD1 gene (SOD1) that encodes 153 amino acids (9Deng H.X. Hentati A. Tainer J.A. Zafar I.

To date, more than 110 familial ALS (FALS)-causing mutations in SOD1 have been identified (available on the World Wide Web); however, the mechanism by which SOD1 mutants induce ALS remains unknown. The presence of intracellular aggregates that contain SOD1 in spinal cord motor neurons is thought to be a pathological hallmark of ALS. In particular, FALS-linked mutant SOD1s are prone to misfolding and aggregation (11Julien J.P. Cell. 2001; 104: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 12Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Recently, Ezzi et al. (7Ezzi S.A. Urushitani M. Julian J.P. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) reported that even wild-type SOD1 results in aggregation after oxidation, and the oxidized wild-type SOD1 gains properties like FALS mutant SOD1s. In addition to ALS, oxidative damaged SOD1 proteins were detected in the brains of patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (13Choi J. Rees H.D. Weintraub S.T. Levey A.I. Chin L.-S. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11648-11655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that oxidized SOD1 plays a role in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of oxidized wild-type and FALS-linked mutant SOD1s on these diseases remains unclear. Human SOD1 has four cysteine residues, Cys6, Cys57, Cys111, and Cys146. An internal disulfide bond exists between Cys57 and Cys146 (14Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 15Parge H.E. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6109-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which contributes to the high stability of the SOD1 protein. This disulfide bond is highly conserved in SOD1s from various organisms, including yeast, plants, flies, fishes, and mammals. In contrast, two free cysteines, Cys6 and Cys111, are not conserved. Actually, yeast, fungi, and spinach (plants) have no free cysteines, and residue 6 is Ala and residue 111 is Ser in these organisms (16Fink R.C. Scandaliios J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). More evolved organisms, such as flies, fishes, and mammals, including the Japanese monkey, have only one free cysteine, Cys6. Only humans and great apes (chimpanzee and orangutan) have two free cysteines, Cys6 and Cys111 (17Fukuhara R. Tezuka T. Kageyama T. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 296: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Notably, the amino acid sequence of chimpanzee SOD1 is identical to that of human SOD1. Although the evolutionary process may differ from humans and great apes, chicken SOD1 has three free cysteines, including Cys6 and Cys111. The third free Cys residue is located at the C terminus, Cys154 (18Stanton J.L. Wilton S.D. Laing N.G. DNA Seq. 1996; 6: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Because free cysteines are generally reactive, and wild-type SOD1 is less thermo-stable than Ser111-SOD1 or Ala6-SOD1 (19Repock J.R. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the A6C and S111C mutations during evolution are puzzling. In particular, Cys111 is located at the surface of the SOD1 molecule and is thought to be highly reactive. De Beus et al. (20De Beus M.D. Chung J. Colon W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) reported that Cys111 was modified with persulfide (S-SH) in a human SOD1 isolated from erythrocytes that is commercially available (Sigma). The persulfide SOD1 was more resistant to copper-induced aggregation than wild-type SOD1 (20De Beus M.D. Chung J. Colon W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sulfur atom of cysteine is able to assume several different oxidation states. Reversible oxidation of cysteine to disulfide (-S-S-) or sufenic acid (-SOH) is readily accomplished by thiols, such as DTT, 2-ME, glutathione, or thioredoxin. In contrast, oxidation to sulfinic acid (-SO2H) or sulfonic acid (-SO3H) is not reduced by these thiols under physiological conditions (21Jacob C. Holme A.L. Fry F.H. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004; 2: 1953-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For example, one cysteine in the active site of peroxiredoxin (Prx) is oxidized to sulfinic acid (-SO2H) by incubation with an excess of substrate of this enzyme, H2O2, and rereduced by a specific enzyme, sulfiredoxin, but not by general thiols (22Yang K.-S.

An upper shifted band of human wild-type or mutant SOD1s, with the exception of mutant C111S, on SDS-PAGE has been observed under a variety of conditions: during purification (24Hallewell R.A. Imlay K.C. Lee P. Fong N.M. Gallegos C. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Cabelli D.E. Tekamp-Olson P. Mullenbach G.T. Cousens L.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 474-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or when hydrogen peroxide or copper ion is added (see Fig. 1). The SOD1 in the upper band is speculated to be irreversibly linked to another molecule via a covalent bond at Cys111; however, neither the molecule nor the modification site have been identified. Ube Industries Ltd. developed recombinant human SOD1 chemically modified with 2-mercaptoethanol at Cys111 (2-ME-SOD1; Cys111-S-S-CH2CH2OH). This 2-ME-SOD1 is stable for many years in aqueous solution, showing neither degradation nor a loss of activity. Thus, in this study, the role of Cys111 in oxidative damage of human SOD1 was investigated by comparing 2-ME-SOD1 and wild-type SOD1, and the identity of the molecule that is bound to human SOD1 in the upper band on SDS-PAGE was explored. Through mass spectrometry and limited proteolysis, it was determined that the mass size of the molecule is 32 and 48 and that the modification site in SOD1 is Cys111. We demonstrated that Cys111 in human SOD1 is selectively oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) and to cysteine sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H) even by air oxidation. Moreover, a polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthesized peptide containing Cys111-SO3H. This antibody, denoted as anti-C111ox-SOD1, reacted with the upper band (oxidized SOD1) but not the original band by Western blot analysis. Using this anti-C111ox-SOD1, the role of Cys111 on the generation of SOD1 charge isomers and the presence of oxidized SOD1 in the spinal cord of ALS mice were investigated. Materials—All chemicals used in this study were obtained either from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan), or Sigma unless specified otherwise. Recombinant human SOD1, chemically modified with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME-SOD1), was kindly provided from Ube Industries Ltd. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG were purchased from Dako (Denmark). Lysylendopeptidase (Achromobacter Proteinase I) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Sinapinic acid and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for matrix of MALDI-TOF MS were obtained from Bruker Daltonik GmbH (Bremen, Germany). Conversion of 2-ME-SOD1 to Wild-type SOD1—2-ME-SOD1 was incubated with 20 mm 2-ME for 1 h on ice and desalted with a PD-10 column. The resultant wild-type SOD1 and 2-ME-SOD1 were used in the experiments with the exception of the experiments in Fig. 1, B and C. Production and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant SOD1 Proteins—Overproduction of SOD1s by the baculovirus/insect cells system and purification of SOD1 proteins were carried out as described previously (25Fujiwara N. Miyamoto Y. Ogasahara K. Takahashi M. Ikegami T. Takamiya R. Suzuki K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5061-5070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Oxidation of SOD1 and the Analyses with MonoQ Column—For strong oxidation, SOD1s diluted with miliQ water (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 mm H2O2 for 1 h at room temperature. For mild air oxidation, SOD1s diluted with miliQ water or appropriate buffer were filtered with a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) and were slowly stirred at 30 rpm with a rotator (rotator RT-50; Taitec). The buffer or water containing oxidized SOD1s was changed with buffer A (2 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The SOD1s were applied to a high performance liquid chromatograph (AKTA Explorer 10S) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a MonoQ column (MonoQ™ 4.6/100 PE; Amersham Biosciences). After washing with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (0-100 mm) in buffer A. Adhesive proteins were washed with 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. Lysylendopeptidase Treatment and Peptide Analyses—SOD1 proteins were reduced with DTT, and the free sulfhydryls were carbamidemethylated by adding iodoacetamide (IA) in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. After desalting on a PD-10 column with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), the proteins were digested with 0.25% (w/w) lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemicals) at 37 °C for 16 h. The resultant peptides were applied to a reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatograph (AKTA Explorer 10S) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on TSK-GEL ODS-80TM (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh). The peptides were separated by two linear gradients of 0-30% acetonitrile for 4 column volumes and 30-40% acetonitrile for 8 column volumes containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were detected by their absorbance at 215 nm. The peaks were subjected to the following MS analyses. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis—MALDI-TOF MS spectra of peptides and proteins were measured on an Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer and analyzed by the Flexcontrol 1.2 software package (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany). For analyses of peptides, ions generated by a pulsed UV laser beam (nitrogen laser; λ = 337 nm, 5 Hz) were accelerated to a kinetic energy of 20 kV in reflector mode using positive polarity. Metastable ions generated by laser-induced decomposition of the selected precursor ions were analyzed without any additional collision gas. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (5 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was used as a matrix for peptide analyses. For analyses of proteins, the determinations were performed in linear mode using positive polarity. Sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was used as matrix for protein analyses. Peptide or protein samples (1 μl each) were mixed with matrix solution (4 μl each), and an aliquot (1 μl each) was applied to a polished stainless steel target (Bruker Daltonics). The mixture was dried in air at room temperature for several minutes. Infusion ESI MS Analysis for Peptide Sequence—ESI mass spectra were measured on a Bruker Esquire HCT equipped with a quadrupole ion trap (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The solutions containing peptides digested with lysylendopeptidase were continuously introduced through the electrospray interface with a syringe infusion pump (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The MS conditions were as follows: nebulizer gas (N2), 10 p.s.i.; dry gas (N2), 4 liters/min; dry temperature, 250 °C; capillary voltage, 3500 V; high voltage end plate offset, -500 V; capillary exit, 190.6 V; skimmer, 40 V; trap drive, 166.7. MS/MS spectra were sequenced using BioTool 2.2 software and Sequence editor 2.2 (algorithm provided by Bruker). Trypsin Digestion for MALDI-TOF MS—SOD1 proteins in 50 mm NH4HCO3 were digested with trypsin at 37 °C for 16 h. An aliquot of the digests (10 μl) was boiled, applied to ZipTip C18 P10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA; according to the manufacturer's protocol) for desalting, and then subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis. When alkylation is needed, SOD1 proteins in 50 mm NH4HCO3 were treated with excess IA in the dark at room temperature for 30 min before trypsin digestion. In-gel Digestion of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained Polyacrylamide Gel for MALDI-TOF MS—The gel bands containing SOD1 protein after SDS-PAGE were clipped out and cut into small pieces in a 1.5-ml microtube. To remove Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye, the chopped gels were washed three times with 50 mm NH4HCO3 in 30% acetonitrile by shaking at room temperature for 20 min. The gels were further incubated with 500 μl of acetonitrile at room temperature for 10 min. After removing acetonitrile, the gels were incubated with an alkylating solution (500 μl) consisting of 40 mm IA, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NH4HCO3 in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. After washing twice with 50 mm NH4HCO3 (500 μl) for 10 min, the gels were incubated with 0.4 μg of trypsin in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C overnight. After removing the pieces of gels, the remained solution was concentrated with a SpeedVac concentrator and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analyses. Preparation of Antibody for Cys111-sulfonylated SOD1—Key-hole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide (residues 103-114) containing sulfonylated Cys111 (Cys111-SO3H) was obtained from Sigma. After the initial injection with the peptide-hemocyanin conjugate (200 μg of peptide) mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant, rabbits were subjected to five booster injections, each of 200 μg of peptide with incomplete Freund's adjuvant, administered (at multiple subcutaneous sites) at 1-2-week intervals. Antisera were collected 1 week after the sixth booster injection, and the IgG fraction was precipitated with 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. The IgG fraction passed from the wild-type SOD1 coupled to N-hydroxysucinimide-activated Sepharose was bound to the oxidized SOD1 coupled to N-hydroxysucinimide-activated Sepharose. The bound IgG was eluted with 3 m MgCl2 and collected. The IgG was desalted with a PD-10 column and stored with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) at deep freeze until use. This antibody was denoted as anti-C111ox-SOD1. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (14% gel) and then transferred to a PVDF membrane under semidry conditions by means of a Trans-blot (Bio-Rad). After blocking by incubation with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl) for 2 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated with anti-C111ox-SOD1 (diluted 1:1000), or a goat polyclonal antibody against full-length human SOD1 (25Fujiwara N. Miyamoto Y. Ogasahara K. Takahashi M. Ikegami T. Takamiya R. Suzuki K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5061-5070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), anti-SOD1 (diluted 1:1000), in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 1% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature or for 18 h at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:5000) for anti-C111ox-SOD1 or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (diluted 1:5000) in TBS-T containing 1% skim milk for anti-SOD1, respectively, for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the chemiluminescence method using an ECL or an ECL plus kit (GE Healthcare) was employed to detect peroxidase activity. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Sample proteins were dissolved in 8 m urea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer (GE Healthcare), and 12 μl/ml DeStreak™ reagent (GE Healthcare), which forms stable disulfide bonds and prevents nonspecific Cys residue oxidation during isoelectric focusing (26Basso M. Massignan T. Samengo G. Cheroni C. De Biasi S. Salmona M. Bendotti C. Bonetto V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33325-33335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The samples were applied to 11-cm IPG strips (pH 4-7), and the strips were then isoelectrically focused on an IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (GE Healthcare) according to the following schedule: 500 V-h at 500 V for step and hold, 800 V-h at 1000 V for gradient, 8800 V-h at 6000 V for gradient, and 4000 V-h at 6000 V for step and hold. The strips were equilibrated for 20 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 6 m urea, 2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (w/v) DTT. Second dimension separation was run on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and followed by Western blot analysis. pI values of spots were calculated according to the graph showing pH as function of distance at 20 °C and 8 m urea of IPG strips (pH 4-7) provided by the GE Healthcare on-line system. ELISA—Wild-type SOD1 was air-oxidized, treated with and without 100 mm IA, and then diluted to 500 ng/ml with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). 100 μl of the samples were added to each well of 96-well microplates (Maxisorp; Nunc), incubated overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBS-T, and then blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1% BSA in PBS. The plates were then washed three times with TBS-T, and 100 μl of anti-C111ox-SOD1 and anti-SOD1 antibodies (diluted 1:1000 in TBS-T) was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with TBS-T, and 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T) for anti-C111ox-SOD1 or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T) for anti-SOD1, respectively, was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing five times with TBS-T, the plates were developed using 100 μl of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride solution, and the reaction was stopped with 25 μl of 2 m HCl. The absorbance of each well was determined at 490 nm with a SPECTRAmax PLUS384 (Molecular Devices). Animals and Animal Tissue Preparation—Four transgenic mice carrying a high copy number of the human G93A SOD1 gene (B6SJL-TgN[SOD1-G93A]1Gur, G1H-G93A) mice, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Two age-matched littermates were used as controls. All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines for care and use (Tottori University). All four G1H-G93A mice at 110 days of age neurologically exhibited hind limb paralysis, and two littermate mice at 110 days of age did not show any clinical symptoms. The G1H-G93A and littermate mice were euthanized at 110 days of age. Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.1 ml/100 g of body weight). After perfusion of three G1H-G93A and two littermate mice via the aorta with PBS at 37 °C, they were fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). The spinal cords were removed and then postfixed in the same solution. The spinal cord of one mouse for Western blot analysis was removed after perfusion with PBS, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. Protein Extraction from G1H-G93A Mouse Spinal Cord—The G1H-G93A spinal cord was homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing Complete™ miniprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 100 mm IA for preventing the secondary oxidation of SH groups. The sample was centrifuged at 17, 000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the pellet was homogenized in the ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The sample was centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, the pellet was further homogenized in the ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2% SDS, and the sample was centrifuged at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatants of each homogenization, buffer-soluble, Triton X-100-soluble, and SDS-soluble fractions, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. Immunohistochemical Analysis—After fixation, the specimens were embedded in paraffin, cut into 5-μm-thick sections, and examined for immunohistochemical analysis. Sections were deparaffinized and then washed in PBS. Normal serum homologous with the secondary antibody diluted in 1% BSA-containing PBS (BSA-PBS) was used as a blocking reagent. Tissue sections were incubated with anti-C111ox-SOD1 (diluted 1:1000 in BSA-PBS) at 4 °C for 18 h. Bound antibody was visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex (ABC) method using the appropriate Vectastain Elite ABC rabbit IgG kit (Vector Laboratories) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Wako, Osaka, Japan) as a chromogen. The endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation for 30 min with 3% H2O2 after the secondary antibody treatment to prevent nonspecific oxidation before anti-C111ox-SOD1 treatment. SOD1 Activity—SOD1 activity was assayed using the xanthine-xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c system as described previously (27McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Assay—SOD1 protein concentrations were estimated using a dimeric molar extinction at 280 nm of 10,800 m-1 cm-1 (28Goto J.J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Cabelli D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30104-30109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of crude samples were determined using a BCA™ protein assay kit (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. 2-ME-SOD1 Obtained from Ube Industries Ltd. Was Modified with 2-ME Only at Cys111—First, the chemical modification with 2-mercaptoethanol of recombinant human Cu/Zn-SOD (2-ME-SOD1) was confirmed. The molecular mass of 2-ME-SOD1 was determined to be 15,865.5 (supplemental Fig. S1A) to 15,871 m/z (supplemental Fig. S2A), which suggested the presence of 2-ME (76 Da) in apo-human SOD1 (monoisotopic mass, 15,794.86; average mass, 15,804.55). The metals, copper and zinc, of SOD1 were removed during MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Since this recombinant human SOD1 was expressed in Escherichia coli, the N terminus was not acetylated. To demonstrate that the 2-ME-SOD1 was in fact modified with 2-ME only at Cys111, the 2-ME-SOD1 was digested with trypsin and then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS. The mass of the tryptic peptide (2533 m/z) indicating residues Asp92-Arg115 (2457 m/z) plus the mass of 2-ME (76 Da) (supplemental Fig. S1B) was analyzed by the collision-induced MS/MS. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1C, the major fragment ions, y4 (457.1 m/z), y5 (635.9 m/z), y6 (772.9 m/z), y14 (1530.9 m/z), y19 (2074.4 m/z), and y23 (2418.7 m/z), indicated the presence of 2-ME at Cys111. The mass of the tryptic peptide (933 m"
https://openalex.org/W2061661303,"Plexins are the first known transmembrane receptors that interact directly with small GTPases. On binding to certain Rho family GTPases, the receptor regulates the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and alters cell movement in response to semaphorin guidance cues. In a joint solution NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallographic study, we characterize a 120-residue cytoplasmic independent folding domain of plexin-B1 that directly binds three Rho family GTPases, Rac1, Rnd1, and RhoD. The NMR data show that, surprisingly, the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding-like motif of plexin-B1 is not involved in this interaction. Instead, all three GTPases interact with the same region, beta-strands 3 and 4 and a short alpha-helical segment of the plexin domain. The 2.0 A resolution x-ray structure shows that these segments are brought together by the tertiary structure of the ubiquitin-like fold. In the crystal, the protein is dimerized with C2 symmetry through a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet that is formed outside the fold by a long loop between the monomers. This region is adjacent to the GTPase binding motifs identified by NMR. Destabilization of the dimer in solution by binding of any one of the three GTPases suggests a model for receptor regulation that involves bidirectional signaling. The model implies a multifunctional role for the GTPase-plexin interaction that includes conformational change and a localization of active receptors in the signaling mechanism."

We examined whether creatine monohydrate (CrM) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) could enhance strength gains and improve body composition (i.e., increase fat-free mass (FFM); decrease body fat) following resistance exercise training in older adults (>65 y). Men (N = 19) and women (N = 20) completed six months of resistance exercise training with CrM (5g/d)+CLA (6g/d) or placebo with randomized, double blind, allocation. Outcomes included: strength and muscular endurance, functional tasks, body composition (DEXA scan), blood tests (lipids, liver function, CK, glucose, systemic inflammation markers (IL-6, C-reactive protein)), urinary markers of compliance (creatine/creatinine), oxidative stress (8-OH-2dG, 8-isoP) and bone resorption (Nu-telopeptides). Exercise training improved all measurements of functional capacity (P<0.05) and strength (P<0.001), with greater improvement for the CrM+CLA group in most measurements of muscular endurance, isokinetic knee extension strength, FFM, and lower fat mass (P<0.05). Plasma creatinine (P<0.05), but not creatinine clearance, increased for CrM+CLA, with no changes in serum CK activity or liver function tests. Together, this data confirms that supervised resistance exercise training is safe and effective for increasing strength in older adults and that a combination of CrM and CLA can enhance some of the beneficial effects of training over a six-month period.

https://openalex.org/W1987977850,"Native smooth muscle L-type Cav1.2 calcium channels have been shown to support a fraction of Ca2+ currents with a window current that is close to resting potential. The smooth muscle L-type Ca2+ channels are also more susceptible to inhibition by dihydropyridines (DHPs) than the cardiac channels. It was hypothesized that smooth muscle Cav1.2 channels exhibiting hyperpolarized shift in steady-state inactivation would contribute to larger inhibition by DHP, in addition to structural differences of the channels generated by alternative splicing that modulate DHP sensitivities. In addition, it has also been shown that alternative splicing modulates DHP sensitivities by generating structural differences in the Cav1.2 channels. Here, we report a smooth muscle L-type Cav1.2 calcium channel splice variant, Cav1.2SM (1/8/9*/32/Δ33), that when expressed in HEK 293 cells display hyperpolarized shifts for steady-state inactivation and activation potentials when compared with the established Cav1.2b clone (1/8/9*/32/33). This variant activates from more negative potentials and generates a window current closer to resting membrane potential. We also identified the predominant cardiac isoform Cav1.2CM clone (1a/8a/Δ9*/32/33) that is different from the established Cav1.2a (1a/8a/Δ9*/31/33). Importantly, Cav1.2SM channels were shown to be more sensitive to nifedipine blockade than Cav1.2b and cardiac Cav1.2CM channels when currents were recorded in either 5 mm Ba2+ or 1.8 mm Ca2+ external solutions. This is the first time that a smooth muscle Cav1.2 splice variant has been identified functionally to possess biophysical property that can be linked to enhanced state-dependent block by DHP.

This is the first time that a smooth muscle Cav1.2 splice variant has been identified functionally to possess biophysical property that can be linked to enhanced state-dependent block by DHP. L-type voltage-gated Cav1.2 calcium channels are essential for muscle excitation-contraction coupling and, in particular, for vasotone in smooth muscles (1Ledoux J. Werner M.E. Brayden J.E. Nelson M.T. Physiology (Bethesda). 2006; 21: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that a subpopulation of smooth muscle Cav1.2 calcium channels that activate and inactivate close to resting potentials will underlie basal contractility to contribute to vasotone (2Sanders K.M.

However, this subpopulation of Cav1.2 calcium channels has not been identified. Of the four subunits (α1, β, α2/δ, and γ) that composed the calcium channels, the α1-subunit not only forms the aqueous pore but is also the site for binding of organic agonists or antagonists (5Striessnig J.

The Cav1.2 L-type calcium channels are localized mainly in the brain, cardiac, and smooth muscles and a large number of alternative splicing sites of the α1-subunit have been reported in various tissues (7Abernethy D.R.

Neurobiol. 2003; 23: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been suggested for the observed vascular selectivity of DHP inhibition over cardiac Cav1.2 channels. One mechanism was the more depolarized resting membrane potential of smooth muscles (17Nelson M.T. Standen N.B. Brayden J.E. Worley 3rd, J.F. Nature. 1988; 336: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and the second was the difference in voltage dependence of DHP modulation arising from tissue-specific alternative splicing of mutually exclusive exons 8 and 8a that code for IS6 in smooth and cardiac muscle Cav1.2 channels (18Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar).

Both isoforms were reported to have minor differences at four alternative splicing loci amounting to ∼5% of their amino acid sequence. The four splice sites are: exon 1/1a in the N terminus, exon 8/8a in the transmembrane segment IS6, exon 31/32 in the transmembrane segment IVS3, and exon 9* in the cytoplasmic loop connecting domains I and II.

Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar), whereas Cav1.2b contained alternatively spliced exons 1/8/9*/32/33 (19Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Notably, both channels share similar activation and inactivation properties (21Hu H. Marban E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 902-907PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lacinova L. Klugbauer N. Hofmann F. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 50-60PubMed Google Scholar). However, Cav1.2b channels are more sensitive to nisoldipine due to the presence of the alternatively spliced exon 8 within the IS6 segment (18Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Hu H. Marban E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 902-907PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, these previous works reported the lack of linkage between the gating properties of Cav1.2 smooth and cardiac muscle splice variants with vascular specificity for DHP inhibition (18Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Hu H. Marban E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 902-907PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown by systematic transcript scanning that the Cav1.2 subunit is subject to extensive alternative splicing generating potentially a large number of splice combinations (8Tang Z.Z.

For our second hypothesis, we tested whether a smooth muscle Cav1.2 splice variant exists that possesses a gating property that will link its steady-state inactivation property to the potency of inhibition by DHP as blockade by DHP is state-dependent.In the present study, we report a smooth muscle Cav1.2 splice variant (Cav1.2SM) that differs from the notable smooth muscle Cav1.2b channel that lacks exon 33. Here we showed that the Cav1.2SM calcium channels exhibited a more hyperpolarized Ca2+ window current that supports our first hypothesis. Interestingly, the same Cav1.2SM splice variant also possesses electrophysiological and pharmacological properties that support our second hypothesis to link altered biophysical property of a smooth muscle Cav1.2 channel splice variant to the potency of DHP inhibition. Taken together, we showed that unexpectedly a single smooth muscle Cav1.2 splice variant, Cav1.2SM, underlies both a hyperpolarized window current that is reminiscent of the window current of a subpopulation of channels observed in smooth muscles (2Sanders K.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Fleischmann B.K. Murray R.K. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It contains the combination of exons 1/8/Δ9*/32/Δ33. The smooth muscle form (Cav1.2SM) was generated by substituting a ClaI and SgrAI fragment containing human exon 9* into 77(Δ33), thus generating the splice variant Cav1.2SM containing alternatively spliced exons 1/8/9*/32/Δ33. The human Cav1.2b contained exons 1/8/9*/32/33 (18Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Biel M. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hullin R. Stuhmer W. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F.

Soong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50329-50335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To generate the construct of the cardiac muscle form (Cav1.2CM), a two-step cloning was performed. A fragment containing human exon 8a was digested with BstApI and ClaI and cloned into the human 77(WT) construct provided by Dr. Roger Zuhlke to replace exon 8. Human exon 1a was further introduced to this construct using HindIII and AfeI restriction enzymes. Thus the Cav1.2CM construct contains exons 1a/8a/Δ9*/32/33.RT-PCR, Colony Screening, and Restriction Enzyme Digestion—Young adult male Wistar rats (150-200 g) were sacrificed by CO2 followed by subsequent cervical dislocation. All animal experimentations were conducted according to IACUC guidelines and all procedures have been approved by the University's Animal Ethics Committee. Human radial arteries were obtained, with informed consent, from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass operations in the National Heart Center of Singapore. The work was approved by the IRB committees of the National Heart Center of Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, and the National University of Singapore.Total RNA from thoracic aorta, cerebral basilar arteries, mesentery arteries, and hearts were extracted with RNAeasy kits (Qiagen). Reverse transcription for first strand synthesis was carried out using the SUPERSCRIPT™ II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 18-mer oligo(dT) primer. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplifying rat Cav1.2 amplicon flanking exon 33 were: GCCTCTTCACGGTGGAG (forward) and TCCCAATCACTGCATAGATAA (reverse). Primers used to amplify similar regions in human radial arteries were: AACACCATCTGCCTGGCCATG (forward) and AGGTCTGAAAGTTGTTGTTCCGG (reverse). The PCR protocol includes a denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. After electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, the PCR products were excised, extracted, and purified with a Qiagen kit. The PCR amplicons were further cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and transformed into DH10B Escherichia coli cells. White colonies were selected and grown in 96-well plates. Colony PCRs with the same set of primers and conditions were performed to identify the presence or absence of exon 33 in each clone. Restriction enzyme digestion was used to investigate the expression of mutually exclusive exons 31 and 32, which have similar size. NsiI digestion was carried out in a 30-μl reaction volume at 37 °C for 5 h.Whole Cell Electrophysiological Recordings and Data Analysis—HEK 293 cells in 35-mm dishes were transiently transfected with Cav1.2b, Cav1.2CM, or Cav1.2SM constructs (1.25 μg), together with β2a (1.25 μg) and α2δ (1.25 μg) using the calcium phosphate transfection method (8Tang Z.Z. Liang M.C. Lu S. Yu D. Yu C.Y. Yue D.T. Soong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44335-44343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The β2a and α2δ clones were provided by Dr. Terrance Snutch (University of British Columbia). After 48-72 h, IBa was recorded at room temperature (23 °C) using the whole cell patch clamp technique. The external solution contained (in mm) 10 HEPES, 140 tetraethylammonium methanesulfonate, 5 BaCl2, or 1.8 CaCl2 (pH was adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH and osmolarity to 290-310 with glucose). The internal solution (pipette solution) contained (in mm) 138 Cs-MeSO3, 5 CsCl, 0.5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 2 mg/ml Mg-ATP, pH 7.3 (adjusted with CsOH). Glucose was used to adjust the osmolarities of solutions to between 290 and 330 mOsm. The voltages are uncorrected for a -11-mV junction potential, and actual voltage can be obtained by subtracting 11 mV from the reported values. Whole cell currents, obtained under voltage clamp with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), were filtered at 1-5 kHz and sampled at 5-50 kHz, and the series resistance was typically <5 megaohms after >70% compensation. The P/4 protocol was used to subtract online the leak and capacitive transients.To determine the whole cell I-V relationships, currents were recorded by holding the cell at -90 mV before stepping to various potentials from -50 to 50 mV over 900 ms. In each cell, IBa at all voltages was normalized to the peak current. The I-V curve was fitted with the equation: IBa = Gmax(V - Erev)/(1 + exp((V - V1/2)/k), where Gmax is the maximum conductance; Erev is the reversal potential; V1/2 is the half-activation potential; and k is the slope. The steady-state inactivation curves were obtained from experiments by stepping from a holding potential of -90 mV to a 30-ms normalizing pulse to 10 mV followed by a family of 15-s long prepulses from -120 to 20 mV. A 104-ms test pulse to +10 mV was recorded finally. Each test pulse was normalized to the maximal current amplitude of the normalizing pulse. The steady-state inactivation data were fitted with a single Boltzmann equation: Irelative = Imin + (Imax - Imin)/(1 + exp((V1/2 - V)/k), where Irelative is the normalized current; V1/2 is the potential for half-inactivation, and k is the slope value. G-V curves were obtained from a tail activation protocol. The cells were activated by a 20-ms test pulse of variable voltage family from -60 to 120 mV, and tail currents were measured after repolarization to -50 mV for 10 ms. The tail currents were normalized to the peak currents before fitting with a dual Boltzmann equation: G/Gmax = Flow/{1 + exp((V1/2,low - V)/klow)} + (1-Flow)/{1 + exp((V1/2,high - V)/khigh)}, where G is the tail current and Gmax is the peak tail current, Flow is the fraction of low threshold component; V1/2,low, V1/2,high, klow, and khigh are the half-activation potentials and slope factors for the low and high threshold components and V1/2act was calculated when G = 0.5Gmax. τ values for voltage dependence inactivation (in Ba2+ solution) were calculated from a single exponential equation: I = Imin + Imax(exp(-t/τ)), where Imin is the steady-state amplitude of the current, Imax is the initial current, and τ is the time constant. Recovery from inactivation of IBa was investigated using a standard two-pulse protocol. Fractional recovery of peak IBa were plotted against ΔT. Inactivation time constants (τ) were determined from the double exponential equation: Y = Ymin + A1 × [1 - exp(-t/τf)] + A2 × [1 - exp(-t/τs)], where Y is the fraction of recovery, A1 and A2 are the maximum values of the fast and slow component, and τf and τs are the time constants, respectively.Nifedipine (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to make a 10 mm stock solution and stored at -20 °C. Nifedipine at 0.1-1000 nm concentrations was freshly prepared in bath solution from stock and then applied to the HEK 293 cells. All nifedipine solutions were stored in the dark. The cells were held at either -50 or -90 mV and a test pulse of 100 ms at 0 mV was applied with an inter pulse interval of 30 s. Inhibition ratios were calculated by comparing the peak currents before and after drug treatment. All experiments involving nifedipine were conducted as much as possible in the absence of light.Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. GraphPad Prism software was used for data plotting and statistical analysis. Statistical significance of differences between means was calculated with Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA. p < 0.05 is considered significant.RESULTSDistribution of Exon 33 in Arteries and Hearts—The Cav1.2 calcium channels in cardiac and smooth muscles have been shown to differ at four alternatively spliced sites: exon 1/1a, exon 8/8a, exon 9*, and exon 31/32 (Fig. 1A) (19Biel M.

Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Exon 33 forms part of the IVS3-S4 linker region and in our previous study we showed that the exclusion of exon 33 could shift the activation potential of Cav1.2 channels to more hyperpolarized direction (8Tang Z.Z. Liang M.C. Lu S. Yu D. Yu C.Y. Yue D.T. Soong T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44335-44343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Liao P. Yu D. Lu S. Tang Z. Liang M.C.

In this paper, we investigated whether exon 33 may demonstrate selective expression in smooth and cardiac muscles.The expression of exon 33 was assessed by a RT-PCR colony screening method (8Tang Z.Z.

PCR amplicons spanning exons 30-35 appeared as single bands on 1.8% agarose gels for rat aorta and heart tissues (Fig. 1B). To differentiate +/Δexon 33 in the PCR products, which differed by 33 bp, the PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, transformed into DH10B bacteria, and PCR colony screened for size differences on 1.8% agarose gels. This method provided a means to quantify the level of expression of Cav1.2 transcripts, isolated from aorta and heart, with the inclusion or exclusion of exon 33. Random clones were selected for DNA sequencing analysis to validate the correlation of PCR product size with the +/Δexon 33 genotype in the PCR amplicon. Around 60-120 colonies were screened in each rat heart or artery tissue. A representative agarose gel result of a colony PCR screen was shown in Fig. 1C. Screening of heart Cav1.2 channels showed that the colonies expressed almost exclusively the inclusion of exon 33 (Fig. 1C, upper panel), whereas data from aorta tissue demonstrated that a number of Cav1.2 channels excluded exon 33 (Fig. 1C, lower panel). DNA sequencing confirmed the PCR product of smaller size lacked exon 33, whereas the PCR product of larger size contained exon 33. To further delineate the expression of exon 33 in different regions of the heart and in aorta, we screened PCR products obtained from mRNAs isolated from 3 to 8 rats. Indeed, ∼32% of the Cav1.2 channels in aorta (n = 5 rats) excluded exon 33, whereas the distribution of Δ33 in heart (n = 3-8 rats) varies from 2% in the right ventricle to 5% in the left atrium (Fig. 1D). The total number of colonies screened varied from 190 to 585 for each heart sample or aorta. The expression of Δ33 is significantly different in all four regions of the heart when compared with aorta (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test). However, there is no significant difference in the expression of Δ33 among the various regions of the heart (p = 0.87, one-way ANOVA). As the difference in expression of Δ33 was ∼30%, it would be difficult to detect such minor changes consistently by the real-time PCR method. The colony screening method, however, is more sensitive to detect small variations in the expression of an alternatively spliced exon.To test whether Δ33 expresses in smaller arteries, we harvested rat cerebral basilar arteries and mesentery arteries. A similar colony screening method was used to quantify Δ33 expression. Mesenteric arteries (n = 3 rats) displayed 17%, whereas basilar arteries (n = 3 rats) expressed 36% of Δ33Cav1.2 channels. Both results were significantly different from the levels expressed in rat heart (Fig. 1E, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test). We further investigated the expression of Δ33 in human arteries. Of 5 human radial arteries obtained from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass, the average expression of Δ33 was 24%, which is still significantly higher than in rat heart (Fig. 1E, p < 0.01, oneway ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test). These results indicate that Δ33 expression appears widely in various rat and human arteries.The well known Cav1.2b channels that contain exons 1/8/9*/32 could now be subdivided in a more defined manner into two subgroups: one group contained exon 33, whereas a minor group excluded exon 33 (Fig. 1A). In our previous work we have identified the smooth muscle Cav1.2 channel, genotyped as 1/8/9*/32/Δ33, named Cav1.2SM in this paper to represent ∼10% of the total transcripts (26Tang Z.Z. Hong X. Wang J. Soong T.W. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Cav1.2SM Channels Underlie a Hyperpolarized Window Current—To avoid Ca2+-dependent effects and also for a better comparison with previous reports on Cav1.2a and Cav1.2b channel properties, we first performed electrophysiological recordings using 5 mm Ba2+ as the charge carrier (18Welling A. Ludwig A. Zimmer S. Klugbauer N. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Hu H. Marban E. Mol.

Godfraind T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We found that the Cav1.2SM splice variant showed faster voltage-dependent inactivation during depolarization to Vmax than Cav1.2b channels (Fig. 2A) and Ba2+ influx was significantly reduced, during 0.9-s pulses to Vmax, by about 15% (Fig. 2B). It is known that an increased Ba2+ concentration can accelerate current inactivation. We carefully investigated the voltage-dependent inactivation with matched peak current and found the faster inactivation is still pronounced in Cav1.2SM. We further calculated the time constant (τ values) with a single exponential equation. The τ values from Cav1.2SM channels were significantly lower at 0 and 10 mV (Fig. 2C, p0 mV < 0.01 and p10 mV < 0.05, unpaired t test). It is very likely that the faster inactivation is due to the exclusion of exon 33 in the domain IV S3-S4 loop as the only difference between Cav1.2SM and Cav1.2b is the exclusion of exon 33 in Cav1.2SM. To further determine differences in biophysical properties of the two smooth muscle Cav1.2 splice variants, we examined their activation and inactivation potentials by functionally expressing the splice variants in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2D).FIGURE 2Differences in electrophysiological properties between Cav1.2b and Cav1.2SM calcium channels.

The increase in oseltamivir resistance reported recently has therefore sparked a debate on how to use oseltamivir in non pandemic influenza and the risks associated with wide spread use during a pandemic. Several questions have been asked about the fate of oseltamivir in the sewage treatment plants and in the environment. We have assessed the fate of oseltamivir and discuss the implications of environmental residues of oseltamivir regarding the occurrence of resistance. A series of batch experiments that simulated normal sewage treatment with oseltamivir present was conducted and the UV-spectra of oseltamivir were recorded.Our experiments show that the active moiety of oseltamivir is not removed in normal sewage water treatments and is not degraded substantially by UV light radiation, and that the active substance is released in waste water leaving the plant. Our conclusion is that a ubiquitous use of oseltamivir may result in selection pressures in the environment that favor development of drug-resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2035040393,"Nox activator 1 (NoxA1) is a homologue of p67phox that acts in conjunction with Nox organizer 1 (NoxO1) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NADPH oxidase Nox1. The phosphorylation of cytosolic regulatory components by multiple kinases plays important roles in assembly and activity of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) system, but little is known about regulation by phosphorylation in the Nox1 system. Here we identify Ser172 and Ser461 of NoxA1 as phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A (PKA). A consequence of this phosphorylation was the enhancement of NoxA1 complex formation with 14-3-3 proteins. Using both a transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cell Nox1 model system and endogenous Nox1 in colon cell lines, we showed that the elevation of cAMP inhibits, whereas the inhibition of PKA enhances, Nox1-dependent ROS production through effects on NoxA1. Inhibition of Nox1 activity was intensified by the availability of 14-3-3ζ protein, and this regulatory interaction was dependent on PKA-phosphorylatable sites at Ser172 and Ser461 in NoxA1. We showed that phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding induce the dissociation of NoxA1 from the Nox1 complex at the plasma membrane, suggesting a mechanism for the inhibitory effect on Nox1 activity. Our data establish that PKA-phosphorylated NoxA1 is a new binding partner of 14-3-3 protein(s) and that this forms the basis of a novel mechanism regulating the formation of ROS by Nox1 and, potentially, other NoxA1-regulated Nox family members."

The FKBP domains of many immunophilin proteins possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity that can be blocked by the binding of immunosuppressants such as FK506 (7Harding M.W. Galat A. Uehling D.E. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1989; 341: 758-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar, 8Watanabe S. Tsuruoka S. Vijayakumar S. Fischer G. Zhang Y. Fujimura A. Al-Awqati Q. Schwartz G.J. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 288: F40-F47Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite the sequence similarity between the N terminus of ARA9 and the FKBP domains of other immunophilins, ARA9 does not appear to possess isomerase activity or affinity for FK506 (1Carver L.A.

We postulate that the structural similarity of ARA9 to the immunophilin family is a reflection of a shared capacity to act as a cellular chaperone, and play a role in the folding and localization of client proteins. The ARA9 protein has been extensively studied in association with the AHR. As a chaperone, ARA9 maintains the AHR in a cytosolic localization, decreases AHR degradation, and increases its ligand binding capacity (9LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A.

Although little is known regarding the functional role of ARA9 in PPARα and HBVx function, initial data are consistent with ARA9 acting as a chaperone for these proteins as well (4Sumanasekera W.K.

Yang W.M. Seto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that in addition to xenobiotic signaling, the ARA9 protein is also a common chaperone to many proteins involved in a variety of essential cellular functions. This idea is supported by results from whole mount in situ staining of embryos that show ARA9 expression as early as embryonic day 9.5 (e9.5). This early developmental expression is well before appearance of the AHR or PPARα, which are first expressed around e13.5 (1Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-36159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 12Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W.

Dev. 1998; 73: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition, the spectrum of ARA9 protein expression is broader than that of the AHR or PPARα and includes tissues such as the thalamus and neuroepithelium, where AHR and PPARα are not expressed (12Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 14Jain S. Maltepe E. Lu M.M. Simon C. Bradfield C.A. Mech.

In keeping with this idea, we find that loss of the Ara9 locus in mice leads to a number of phenotypes not found in either the Ahr-/- or Pparα-/- mice. These Ara9-/--specific phenotypes include; lethality during the growth of the embryo accompanied by cardiac malformations including double outlet right ventricle (DORV), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and pericardial edema. Taken in sum, these observations indicate a role for ARA9 in normal mammalian biology, one that is outside of its role as an AHR or PPARα chaperone. Null Allele Strategy—The approach used to create a null allele of Ara9 is part of a strategy that is also being used to generate a conditional allele. Our strategy is based on the idea that reversal of exons 4 through 6 within Ara9 reverses the sequence of the C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), resulting in the truncation of the ARA9 protein and creation of a null allele. The resulting allele is referred to as Ara9ΔCfxneo. As seen in Fig. 1, the Ara9ΔCfxneo targeting construct employed here can easily be modified to construct a conditional allele where exons 4–6 remain in-frame and flanked by the LoxP sites for later excision by a recombinase. 3B. C. Lin, J. Walisser, L. Nguyen, and C. A. Bradfield, manuscript in preparation. Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides used in the study are as follows: OL 3163: 5′-GGC GTC GAC ATA ACT TCG TAT AGC ATA CAT TAT ACG AAG TTA TGA TGG CAC CTC TGC TGC C-3′; OL 3164: 5′-GGC GTC GAC ATA ACT TCG TAT AAT GTA TGC TAT ACG AAG TTA TGA TAG ATT AGT TCT GCA AAG CC-3′; OL 3165: 5′-GGC CCG CGG GAA GGC TGG TCA TCA CTG G-3′; OL 3166: 5′-GGC CCG CGG GTA GAA CTT GAC ATC GTG GC-3′; OL 3161: 5′-GGC GGT ACC CAG GCA GAG AGT CTA GTC TG-3′; OL 3494: 5′-GGC GTC GAC CCC TCA CAG TAA AGC CCT C-3′; OL 4172: 5′-CC CTCGAG ACC ATG AGC AGC GGC GCC AAC-3′; OL 4173 5′-CAG TCC GCC ATG GTC AGT CCT CA-3′. Construction of the Ara9ΔCfxneo Targeting Vector—A 1,761-base pair (bp) region of homology surrounding the exons encoding the TPR domains of Ara9 was PCR amplified from Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) plasmid 17276 (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). Oligonucleotides 3163 and 3164 were used to introduce two LoxP sites flanking the PCR-amplified TPR domains (referred to as the “floxed region” of our targeting vector). To confirm ligation of the floxed region into the pGemTeasy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), we digested the resultant plasmids with SacI to obtain 588-bp and 4,236-bp bands. A 1,600-bp region homologous to the 3′-untranslated region adjacent to exon 6 of Ara9 was PCR-amplified using OL 3165 and 3166 to create the “short arm.” To confirm short arm ligation into pGemTeasy, the construct was digested with EcoR1 to obtain 160-bp, 1,515-bp, and 3,018-bp bands. A 4,222-bp region incorporating exon 2 and the flanking intronic region of Ara9 was PCR amplified using OL 3161 and 3494 to create the “long arm.” To confirm long arm ligation into pGemTeasy, the plasmid was digested with EcoR1 to obtain 527 bp, 3,018-bp, and 3,684-bp bands. The 1,682-bp SacII fragment containing the short arm was cloned into the SacII site of the targeting construct PL 1169 (pFrtLoxPNeo). The PL 1169 was previously described (16Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). To confirm ligation of the short arm into PL1169, the resultant plasmid was digested with PstI to obtain 197-bp, 2,142-bp, and 4,295-bp bands. The 4,222-bp SalI fragment containing the long arm was then cloned into the corresponding sites of the targeting vector containing the short arm (PL 1849). To confirm the long arm ligation into PL1169 already containing the short arm, we digested the plasmid with EcoR1 to obtain 4,107-bp and 6,685-bp bands. A 1,761-kb KpnI/SalI fragment containing the floxed region was then cloned into the KpnI/SalI sites of the final targeting construct that was designated as PL2008 (i.e. Ara9ΔCfxneo). To confirm the final ligation of all homologous regions into PL1169, the plasmid was digested with BamH1 to obtain 553-bp, 844-bp, and 11,165-bp bands. Cell Culture Conditions and Treatments—Cultivation of embryonic stem cells and generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts were performed using methods described previously (17Bunger M.K. Moran S.M. Glover E. Thomae T.L. Lahvis G.P. Lin B.C. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17767-17774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Generation of Ara9ΔCfxneo/fxneo Mice—Approximately 10 μg of the targeting construct was electroporated into ES cells (Genome Systems). Selection was performed using 200 μg/ml G418 (Sigma-Aldrich) until a control plate with untransfected ES cells displayed 100% cell death (roughly 5–6 days). To confirm homologous recombination, ES clones were screened by Southern blot analysis of BamHI-digested genomic DNA. The probe used was derived from an EcoRI-digested fragment that is complementary to the 3′-untranslated region adjacent to exon 6 of Ara9 (PL 2044). The ES cell clones that displayed homologous recombination were injected into 3.5-day post coital C57BL/6 blastocysts and the resulting chimeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice. Contribution of the ES clones to the germline was determined by Southern blot analysis of BamHI-digested DNA isolated from tail biopsies obtained from the progeny. Genotyping—To confirm homologous recombination of the Ara9ΔCfxneo construct, DNA was isolated from proteinase K-digested tail biopsies using phenol-chloroform extraction. Ten micrograms of DNA was digested using BamH1. Genotyping was then confirmed using Southern blot analysis with a probe homologous to the 3′-region past the end of the targeting construct (PL 2044). Animal Care—The Ara9ΔCfxneo mice were housed in accordance with guidelines set by the University of Wisconsin Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility on corn cob bedding with food and water ad libitum. Heterozygous female mice were weighed, paired with males at 4 PM, and then separated at 9 AM the next day. We define gestation time to be at e1.5 the day when the mice are separated. At defined gestational time points, animals were weighed as an indicator of pregnancy then sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Histology—Samples were fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral-buffered formalin overnight to ensure penetration of the fixative. A cavity allowing for dehydration/hydration was created via abdominal puncture. Following overnight fixation, fetuses were dehydrated through serial ethanol washes starting with 0.8% (w/v) NaCl in ethanol, 70% (v/v) ethanol, 85% (v/v) ethanol, 90% (v/v) ethanol, and 100% ethanol. Following dehydration, samples were treated with three washes of 10% (v/v) xylene, then 50:50 (v/v) xylene/paraffin, then washed three times in 60 °C-heated paraffin, and then embedded in fresh 60 °C-heated paraffin. Following embedding, transverse, or sagittal sections (10 μm) were cut through the entire fetus and every 3rd slide was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining—Slides were dipped in 100% xylene twice and then subjected to consecutive washes of 100% ethanol, distilled water, Meyer's Hematoxylin, distilled water, Scott's Solution (23.8 mm NaHCO3, 81.1 mm MgSO4), distilled water, 80% (v/v) ethanol, eosin, 90% (v/v) ethanol, two washes of 100% ethanol, and three washes of 100% xylene. Coverslips were then sealed onto slides using Micromount (Surgipath, Richmond, IL). Western Blot—Western blot of ARA9 was performed using the method described previously (9LaPres J.J. Glover E. Dunham E.E. Bunger M.K. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6153-6159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit ARA9 antibodies were obtained commercially (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). Antibody 1066S2 was raised against amino acids 7–26 (RLREDGIQKRVIQEGRGELPC) within the TPR domain of human ARA9 and antibody R38KEQP recognizes amino acids 215–230 (KEQPGSPEWIQLDKQTHRAC) within the FKBP domain of human ARA9 (Biotech Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison). In Vitro Translation—In vitro translation of the ARA9 protein (PL1326) was expressed using the method described previously (18Dolwick K.M. Schmidt J.V. Carver L.A. Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 911-917PubMed Google Scholar). Generation of Ara9ΔCfxneo Heterozygous and Homozygous Mutant—To create the Ara9ΔCfxneo targeting vector, exons 3–6 were inverted to an antisense orientation (Fig. 1A). A neomycin cassette was then inserted following exon 6 and flanked on either side with Frt sites to allow for excision by Flp recombinase (19Broach J.R. Guarascio V.R. Jayaram M. Cell. 1982; 29: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Germ-line transmission of the resultant Ara9fxneo/fxneo allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Following homologous recombination, wild-type mice are represented by a single band at 2.7 kb, while heterozygous mice show bands at 2.7 kb and 3.9 kb corresponding to the wild-type and targeted allele, respectively (Fig. 1B). Loss of ARA9 Leads to Lethality—Following germ-line transmission of the Ara9ΔCfxneo allele, heterozygous littermates were interbred in an attempt to obtain homozygous Ara9ΔCfxneo/fxneo mice. For a viable allele, the Mendelian ratio predicts a 1:2:1 ratio of wild-type to heterozygous to homozygous pups for a single segregating locus. Genotyping of pups from heterozygote by heterozygote crosses at 4 weeks of age revealed 59 wild-type mice Ara9+/+, 127 heterozygous Ara9ΔCfxneo/+ mice, and no homozygous Ara9ΔCfxneo/fxneo mice (Fig. 1C). Chi-square analysis indicated that the ratio of the genotypes obtained was significantly different from expected based on Mendelian segregation of a viable allele (p ≤ 0.001, χ2 = 54.166). Gross pathology and breeding studies of the heterozygous Ara9ΔCfxneo/+ mice appear phenotypically normal and fertile (data not shown). Presence or Absence of Neomycin Cassette Does Not Effect Lethality—To ensure that lethality was not caused by cis-effects from the neomycin cassette, heterozygous mice were mated with transgenic mice expressing Flp-Recombinase driven by the Gt(ROSA)26Sor promoter (“FLPeR” mice) (20Dymecki S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93 (a): 6191-6196Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This cross removed the neomycin cassette between the two FRT sites when expressed ubiquitously from the ROSA promoter (Fig. 2A). The resulting animals are designated as Ara9ΔCfx. Germline transmission of the resultant Ara9ΔCfx allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Wild-type mice are represented by a single band at 2.7 kb, while heterozygous mice show bands at 2.7 kb and 3.6 kb corresponding to the wild-type and targeted allele with neomycin cassette removed, respectively (Fig. 2B). Following heterozygote by heterozygote crosses of Ara9ΔCfx/+ mice analyzed at 4 weeks of age, there were 22 wild-type mice Ara9+/+, 32 heterozygous Ara9ΔCfx/+, and no homozygous Ara9ΔCfx/fx mice (Fig. 2C). Chi-square analysis indicated that the ratio of the genotypes obtained was significantly different from expected based on Mendelian segregation of a viable allele (p ≤ 0.001, χ2 = 16.711). Given that the presence of the neomycin cassette does not appear to alter the lethality, all data and observations for the remainder of this report are combined results from both Ara9ΔCfxneo/fxneo and Ara9ΔCfx/fx mice and the targeted allele will be referred to as Ara9-/-. Embryonic Lethality Occurs in Both Early and Late Embryonic Development—To investigate the time of lethality in Ara9-/- mice, we examined embryos produced from heterozygote by heterozygote crosses at various time points during gestation. From a total of 156 embryos genotyped at e10–14, there were 52 wild-type (Ara9+/+), 81 heterozygous (Ara9+/-), and 23 homozygous (Ara9-/-) embryos. A chi-square analysis indicated that significant mortality of Ara9-/-animals was associated with the allele as the ratio of the genotypes obtained was significantly different from the expected 1:2:1 ratio based on Mendelian segregation of a viable allele (p ≤ 0.05, χ2 = 6.78). From a total of 89 embryos genotyped at e15–17, there were 30 wild-type (Ara9+/+), 50 heterozygous (Ara9+/-), and 9 homozygous (Ara9-/-) embryos. Chi-square analysis indicated that significant mortality of Ara9-/- animals was associated with the allele as the ratio of the genotypes obtained was significantly different from expected based on Mendelian segregation of a viable allele (p ≤ 0.025, χ2 = 7.79). From a total of 64 embryos genotyped at e18–19, there were 24 wild-type (Ara9+/+), 38 heterozygous (Ara9+/-), and 2 homozygous (Ara9-/-) embryos. Chi-square analysis indicated that significant mortality of Ara9-/- animals was associated with the allele as the ratio of the genotypes obtained was significantly different from expected based on Mendelian segregation of a viable allele (p ≤ 0.001, χ2 = 13.93). The observation that our genotyping at e10–14 indicated a wild-type/heterozygote/homozygote frequency of 1:1.5:0.4, indicates that the first loss of Ara9-/- mice occurs before this developmental point. The 1:1.5:0.4 ratio falls to 1:1.6:0.3 by e15–17 and even further to 1:1.6:0.08 by e18–19 (Fig. 3). Western Blot Reveals a Decrease in ARA9 Protein in Multiple Tissues—Cytosolic extracts were prepared from various tissue samples taken from 8–10 week old wild-type Ara9+/+ or heterozygous Ara9+/- mice. All Western blots were carried out on adult animals as embryonic lethal nulls did not provide enough protein to carry out a conclusive Western blot analysis. Samples from heart, lung, kidney, and spleen were then analyzed by Western blot using rabbit reticulocyte lysate translated human Ara9 cDNA as a positive control. The ARA9 protein from tissue samples ran at the same size as control protein and this band was detectable by both an N-terminal, “FKBP”-specific antibody (1066S2) and a C-terminal, “TPR”-specific (R38KEQP) antibody. As predicted for a heterozygous Ara9+/- mouse, all tissues show an approximate 50% decrease in ARA9 protein levels compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 4, A and B). Vascular and Cardiac Abnormalities in Ara9-/- Mice—At e10.5, gross morphology of surviving Ara9-/- embryos appeared outwardly normal. Embryos at all stages of gestation were assessed as “alive” if there was detectable movement in response to stimuli of light pressure and bled when the umbilical cord was removed. All Ara9-/- animals with one exception at e18.5, appeared to be alive. By e14.5–15, surviving Ara9-/- embryos displayed a decreased volume of blood in vessels in the head and extremities (forelimbs and hind limbs). The homozygous embryos were markedly paler than heterozygous and wild-type littermates (Fig. 5). There was no significant difference observed in sizes of pups (data not shown). Histological sections from e13.5–18.5 day embryos were sectioned through entirely and examined for abnormalities. Sections taken from homozygous Ara9-/- embryos, between e13.5–15 and e18.5 indicated severe heart phenotypes. Microscopic examination of head, lung, liver, and all other major organ sections from wild-type, heterozygous, and null embryos yielded no further obvious abnormalities (data not shown). In normal physiology, the pulmonary artery has an outlet from the right ventricle and the aorta has an outlet from the left ventricle. However, in 57% (4/7) of all surviving Ara9-/- embryos between e13.5–14.5, there was a double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) where both the pulmonary artery and aorta display an outlet from the right ventricle (Fig. 6, A and B). In the majority of cases where homozygous null animals had a DORV, there was a concomitant presence of an abnormal opening between the two ventricles. This abnormal opening, referred to as a ventricular septal defect (VSD), presented with a 71% penetrance (5/7) in Ara9-/- embryos (Fig. 7, A and B). Accompanying these heart defects was pronounced pericardial edema, whereby the pericardial sac is enlarged and filled with fluid. This pericardial edema was seen in 71% (5/7) of the embryos (Fig. 8).FIGURE 7Normal heart in Ara9+/+ and Ara9+/- fetuses in comparison to wild-type and heterozygote littermates.

At e18.5, some homozygous animals also presented with an open abdominal cavity (omphalocele) as well as hemorrhaging, and petechiae along the surface of their bodies near the head and upper torso seen in embryos between e14.5 to e18.5 (Fig. 9B). Relationship to Xenobiotic Receptors—In an effort to test the hypothesis that ARA9 plays a role independent of known xenobiotic receptor-associated pathways, we have generated a null allele at the Ara9 locus in mice and compared its phenotype to that of the previously described Ahr-/- and Pparα-/- mice. These studies arose from our interest in the study of AHR signal transduction. Having identified ARA9 as important in AHR biology, we became interested in determining whether ARA9 played a role that was specific to xenobiotic receptor signaling or whether it played a broader role in mammalian development. This knowledge is important if we are to be able to interpret studies employing ARA9 mutants in the context of AHR or PPARα biology. Based upon previously published expression data for ARA9, PPARα, and AHR, we were not surprised to find that this member of the immunophilin family appeared to have physiological importance outside of xenobiotic signaling (21Eisen H.J. Hannah R.R. Legraverend C. Okey A.B. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Actions Hormones. 1983; 10: 227-257Crossref Google Scholar, 22Motojima K. Hirai T. Febs J. 2006; 273: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In keeping with our initial prediction, these data are consistent with the idea that ARA9 plays roles in mammalian biology that extends beyond the realm of xenobiotic receptor signal transduction. This conclusion is based on the observations that the Ara9-/- allele presents with embryonic lethality and displays a range of cardiac phenotypes that are not observed in either the Ahr-/- or Pparα-/- mouse models (23Schmidt J.V. Su G.H. Reddy J.K. Simon M.C. Bradfield C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6731-6736Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 24Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Hilbert D.M. Rudikoff S.

If ARA9 function is unique to AHR or PPARα signaling, one would expect the corresponding null alleles to have significant overlap or be partial phenocopies of each other. Also in support of additional biological roles for ARA9 is the recent observation of its associations with additional mammalian proteins such as the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (26Lees M.J. Peet D.J.

https://openalex.org/W2081834615,"Background Similar to tissue stem cells, primitive tumor cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia have been observed to undergo quiescence; that is, the cells can temporarily stop dividing. Using mathematical models, we investigate the effect of cellular quiescence on the outcome of therapy with targeted small molecule inhibitors. Methods and Results According to the models, the initiation of treatment can result in different patterns of tumor cell decline: a biphasic decline, a one-phase decline, and a reverse biphasic decline. A biphasic decline involves a fast initial phase (which roughly corresponds to the eradication of cycling cells by the drug), followed by a second and slower phase of exponential decline (corresponding to awakening and death of quiescent cells), which helps explain clinical data. We define the time when the switch to the second phase occurs, and identify parameters that determine whether therapy can drive the tumor extinct in a reasonable period of time or not. We further ask how cellular quiescence affects the evolution of drug resistance. We find that it has no effect on the probability that resistant mutants exist before therapy if treatment occurs with a single drug, but that quiescence increases the probability of having resistant mutants if patients are treated with a combination of two or more drugs with different targets. Interestingly, while quiescence prolongs the time until therapy reduces the number of cells to low levels or extinction, the therapy phase is irrelevant for the evolution of drug resistant mutants. If treatment fails as a result of resistance, the mutants will have evolved during the tumor growth phase, before the start of therapy. Thus, prevention of resistance is not promoted by reducing the quiescent cell population during therapy (e.g., by a combination of cell activation and drug-mediated killing). Conclusions The mathematical models provide insights into the effect of quiescence on the basic kinetics of the response to targeted treatment of CML. They identify determinants of success in the absence of drug resistant mutants, and elucidate how quiescence influences the emergence of drug resistant mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1965584383,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) plays a major role in chronic heart failure, signaling through two different receptor subtypes, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Our aim was to further delineate the functional role and signaling pathways related to TNFR1 and TNFR2 in cardiac myocytes. In cardiac myocytes isolated from control rats, TNFα induced ROS production, exerted a dual positive and negative action on [Ca2+] transient and cell fractional shortening, and altered cell survival. Neutralizing anti-TNFR2 antibodies exacerbated TNFα responses on ROS production and cell death, arguing for a major protective role of the TNFR2 pathway. Treatment with either neutralizing anti-TNFR1 antibodies or the glutathione precursor, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), favored the emergence of TNFR2 signaling that mediated a positive effect of TNFα on [Ca2+] transient and cell fractional shortening. The positive effect of TNFα relied on TNFR2-dependent activation of the cPLA2 activity, independently of serine 505 phosphorylation of the enzyme. Together with cPLA2 redistribution and AA release, TNFα induced a time-dependent phosphorylation of ERK, MSK1, PKCζ, CaMKII, and phospholamban on the threonine 17 residue. Taken together, our results characterized a TNFR2-dependent signaling and illustrated the close interplay between TNFR1 and TNFR2 pathways in cardiac myocytes. Although apparently predominant, TNFR1-dependent responses were under the yoke of TNFR2, acting as a critical limiting factor. In vivo NAC treatment proved to be a unique tool to selectively neutralize TNFR1-mediated effects of TNFα while releasing TNFR2 pathways.

Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R577-R595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Silenced under normal conditions, myocardial TNFα expression is enhanced upon sustained hemodynamic overloading of the heart or ischemic injury. Levine et al. (2Levine B. Kalman J. Mayer L. Fillit H.M. Packer M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) were the first to correlate circulating levels of TNFα with the severity of chronic heart failure in patients and postulated that TNFα might contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure. Thereafter, increased circulating TNFα has been shown to be associated with many forms of cardiac injury, including acute viral myocarditis, myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, chronic heart failure, cardiac allograft rejection, and sepsis-associated cardiac dysfunction (1Meldrum D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R577-R595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies clearly highlight that a control of the TNFα destructive role in cardiovascular disease represents a realistic goal for clinical medicine.Nevertheless, a large body of evidence indicates that TNFα also exerts beneficial effects on the heart (3Kurrelmeyer K.M. Michael L.H. Baumgarten G. Taffet G.E. Peschon J.J. Sivasubramanian N. Entman M.L. Mann D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5456-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). In fact, high levels of TNFα are detected in patients with well compensated heart failure, suggesting that TNFα may serve as a short term adaptive response and initiate cardiac remodeling (4Mann D.L. J. Card Fail. 1996; 2: S165-S172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Sack M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 94: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Sack M.N. Smith R.M.

Heart. 2005; 91: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This protective action of TNFα might explain why large scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials with TNFα antagonists have failed to show any improvement in the clinical status of heart failure and even highlighted worsening of the clinical condition of patients with moderate to severe heart failure (8Gullestad L. Aukrust P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2005; 95 (discussion 38C–40C): 17C-23CAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Gupta S. Tripathi C.D. Indian J. Med. Sci. 2005; 59: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).The biological responses to TNFα are mediated through two structurally distinct receptors: type 1 (TNFR1) and type 2 (TNFR2), both expressed in cardiac myocytes (10Torre-Amione G. Kapadia S. Lee J. Bies R.D. Lebovitz R. Mann D.L. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1487-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Although the exact functional significance of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in the heart is not known at present, the majority of the deleterious effects of TNFα are related to the activation of TNFR1, and include short term negative inotropic effects (10Torre-Amione G. Kapadia S. Lee J. Bies R.D. Lebovitz R. Mann D.L. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1487-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and long term TNFα-induced cell death (11Shen H.M. Pervaiz S. Faseb J. 2006; 20: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of TNFR2 appears to exert protective effects (12Higuchi Y. McTiernan C.F. Frye C.B. McGowan B.S. Chan T.O. Feldman A.M. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1892-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Ramani R. Mathier M. Wang P. Gibson G. Togel S. Dawson J. Bauer A. Alber S. Watkins S.C. McTiernan C.F. Feldman A.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2004; 287: H1369-H1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the cardiac TNFR1 downstream signaling system has been studied extensively (1Meldrum D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R577-R595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transduction of signals from TNFR2 and its role in TNFα signaling remains far less well characterized.TNFα has been shown to induce oxidant stress and to cause a drop in glutathione levels, which precedes and regulates its cytotoxic effects (14Liu B. Andrieu-Abadie N. Levade T. Zhang P. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in in vivo studies, we have previously shown that a glutathione precursor, antioxidant molecule, NAC prevents the deleterious effect of TNFα on cardiac myocyte contraction from control rats, and hinders the progression of cardiac injury in hypertensive L-NAME-treated rats and in post-myocardial infarction rats (15Bourraindeloup M.

Our working hypothesis was that NAC treatment might be a unique tool to characterize TNFR2-dependent signaling pathways insofar as protective action of NAC against TNFα might rely on TNFR1 signaling inhibition. In this study, we compared TNFα signaling pathways, in cardiac myocytes isolated from control or NAC-treated rats and investigated the impact of neutralizing TNFR1 or TNFR2 antibodies. Our results clearly demonstrate that TNFR1 mediates production of ROS, dual positive and negative effects on [Ca2+]i handling and cell fractional shortening and cell death. In contrast, TNFR2 plays a major protective role through inhibition of ROS production and cell death. Treatment with either NAC or neutralizing TNFR1 antibodies reveal a new TNFR2-dependent positive effect on [Ca2+] handling and cell fractional shortening mediated by activation of cPLA2, PKCζ, and CaMKII pathways, leading to threonine 17 phosphorylation of phospholamban.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—TNFα was from R&D Systems. NAC, MAFP, and L-NAME were from Sigma. The PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate was from BIOSOURCE (Clinisciences, Montrouge, France). [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid (180–240 Ci/mmol) was from GE Healthcare (Les Ulis, France).Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phospho-p44/p42 (Thr202/Tyr204), against phospho-MSK1 (Thr581) and against phospho-cPLA2 (Ser505) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories.Cardiac Myocyte Isolation—The care and the use of animals were in accordance with institutional guidelines. Adult, male Wistar rats (180–250 g, Janvier, LeGenest St Isle, France) were used. Rats received, or not, NAC (Sigma) added to the drinking water (50 mg/d per animal), for 2 weeks. Calcium-tolerant myocytes were isolated by cardiac retrograde aortic perfusion as previously described (18Ait-Mamar B. Cailleret M. Rucker-Martin C. Bouabdallah A. Candiani G. Adamy C. Duvaldestin P. Pecker F. Defer N. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated cardiac myocytes were plated on laminin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) and cultured up to 2 days, as described previously (18Ait-Mamar B. Cailleret M. Rucker-Martin C. Bouabdallah A. Candiani G.

Note that after isolation of cardiac myocytes from NAC-treated rats, experiments were performed in the absence of NAC or glutathione supplementation.Measurement of [Ca2+]i Transients and Cell Fractional Shortening—Measurements of [Ca2+]i transients and cell fractional shortening were performed in plated cardiac myocytes, loaded with Fura2-AM (Molecular Probes) and submitted to electrical stimulation (square waves, 0.5 Hz) as previously described (16Cailleret M. Amadou A. Andrieu-Abadie N. Nawrocki A. Adamy C. Ait-Mamar B. Rocaries F. Best-Belpomme M. Levade T. Pavoine C. Pecker F.

Results are shown as mean ± S.E. on at least 10 cells obtained from three different isolations, or a typical representative.Coordinated ROS and [Ca2+]i Imaging—Imaging experiments were performed at room temperature in BSS buffer (in mm: 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 200 glucose, and 50 HEPES, pH 7.4). Cell-permeant 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize intracellular ROS. Cells were exposed to 5 μm H2DCF-DA and 1.5 μm Fura2-AM, for 20 min at room temperature, to combine ROS and [Ca2+]i imaging. After washing, cells were checked for appropriate [Ca2+]i transient responses to electrical stimulation, as well as to TNFα, before and after recording of the DCF fluorescence images, respectively. DCF fluorescence was recorded as previously reported (16Cailleret M. Amadou A. Andrieu-Abadie N. Nawrocki A. Adamy C. Ait-Mamar B. Rocaries F. Best-Belpomme M. Levade T. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Circulation. 2004; 109: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using 480 nm and 540 nm as excitation and emission wavelength, respectively. At the end of each experiment, maximal DCF fluorescence was determined in response to 2.5 mm H2O2. Results are shown as typical representation from experiments performed on at least 10 cells obtained from three different cell isolations.Measurement of ROS Production in Isolated Cardiac Myocytes—Cardiac myocytes (7,000 cells/well in 96-well plates precoated with laminin) were allowed to attach overnight. After one wash with BSS buffer, cells were loaded for 30 min at 37 °C with 5 μm H2DCF-DA together with increasing concentrations of anti-TNFR1- or anti-TNFR2-Mabs or vehicle, in BSS buffer. After one wash with BSS buffer, either 25 ng/ml TNFα, 2.5 mm H2O2, or vehicle were added, and fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively, was monitored every 5 min for 30 min (FL-600 multiplate fluorimeter, Biotek Instruments). Values were corrected for cell autofluorescence. Results were the mean of three different experiments performed on two different cell isolations.Measurement of Cell Survival—Cardiac myocytes isolated from control rats were preincubated for 30 min with or without 3 μg/ml anti-TNFR1- or TNFR2-Mabs before addition or not of 25 ng/ml TNFα, and cultured for 18 h. In parallel, cardiac myocytes isolated from NAC-treated rats were cultured for 18 h, in the presence or in the absence of 25 ng/ml TNFα. Cardiac myocytes were visualized using brightfield at ×100 magnification, and survival was estimated by counting viable rod-shaped cells versus contracted, nonrod-shaped, dead cells, in 20 random microscopic fields. At least 300 cells were counted in each dish, and results were the mean of two different experiments performed on two different cell isolations.Measurement of [3H]AA Release—Freshly isolated cardiac myocytes were plated in 12-well plates previously coated with 10 μg of laminin (30,000 cells/well). Following adhesion (4 h), the cell medium was replaced by fresh medium supplemented with [3H]AA (0.3 μCi/well) and cells kept in culture for 24 h in humidified 6% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Where indicated, neutralizing TNFR1 or TNFR2 antibodies were added during the last 30 min of incubation. Cells were kept at 37 °C, washed twice with 1 ml of BSS buffer containing 0.2% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. At time 0, cells were exposed to TNFα or vehicle, and medium samples of 200 μl were taken at time 5, 10, and 20 min, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and diluted with 200 μl of icecold EGTA (4 mm final). After centrifugation at 17,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the amount of radioactivity in the supernatants was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, as previously described (16Cailleret M. Amadou A. Andrieu-Abadie N. Nawrocki A. Adamy C. Ait-Mamar B. Rocaries F. Best-Belpomme M. Levade T. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Circulation. 2004; 109: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Sauvadet A. Rohn T. Pecker F. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12437-12445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Results were obtained from quadruplicate determinations. Kinetics analyses of the data showed a linear [3H]AA release during the 20-min period examined, in all conditions tested. This allowed determination of the rate of [3H]AA release and comparison of rates in the absence and in the presence of TNFα. Results were expressed as TNFα-induced increases in the rate of [3H]AA release and were the mean ± S.E. of three different experiments performed on three different cell isolations.Immunoblot Analysis of the Phosphorylation Status of ERK, MSK1, cPLA2, CaMKII, PKCζ, and PLB—Freshly isolated cardiac myocytes were submitted to pretreatment with or without neutralizing antibodies or MAFP followed by incubation with or without 25 ng/ml TNFα in BSS buffer at 37 °C for the indicated period of time. Following centrifugation, cellular pellets were dissolved in Laemmli-loading buffer and samples (30 μg) subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% (P-cPLA2), 10% (P-MSK1, P-PKCζ, and P-ERK) and 18% (P-PLB) acrylamide gels). Proteins were electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (0.45 μm (P-ERK, P-MSK1, P-cPLA2, P-CaMKII, P-PKCζ) or 0.22 μm (P-PLB) (Millipore)). Membranes were first incubated with antibodies against P-ERK, P-MSK1, P-cPLA2, P-PKCζ, or P-PLB, 1:1,000 dilution or antibodies against P-CaMKII, 1:2000 dilution. Blots were then treated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500 dilution) or goat anti-mouse (1:500 dilution) antibodies. The peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Supersignal West Dura). Signals were normalized to the actin signal (1:2000 dilution of primary antibodies).Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on freshly isolated myocytes fixed with 4% formaldehyde at room temperature as described previously (18Ait-Mamar B. Cailleret M. Rucker-Martin C. Bouabdallah A. Candiani G. Adamy C. Duvaldestin P. Pecker F. Defer N. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, myocytes were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block nonspecific binding sites, followed by overnight incubation with a solution of mouse monoclonal antibodies against cPLA2 (1: 250 dilution). After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h with an excess of the secondary FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibodies (1: 200 dilution). After washing, coverslips were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium. Labeling of cells with secondary antibodies alone was carried out as negative control.Images were collected as previously described (18Ait-Mamar B. Cailleret M. Rucker-Martin C. Bouabdallah A. Candiani G. Adamy C. Duvaldestin P. Pecker F. Defer N. Pavoine C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18881-18890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with a Zeiss LSM-510 multitracking laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SAS, Frankfurt, Germany), laser line 488 nm and an oil objective ×63 (NA 1.4). We studied nine individual myocytes in each condition examined (control versus TNFα, in the presence or absence of anti-TNFR1 or TNFR2 Mab antibodies). Note that we were only able to analyze TNFα -dependent redistribution of global cPLA2 labeling due to the lack of availability of antibodies directed against P-cPLA2 isoforms others than P-Ser505-cPLA2. Thus, only TNFα-dependent intensification of the cPLA2 signal was detectable without precise enzyme redistribution localization likely due to the limited portion of enzyme redistributed in response to TNFα compared with total cPLA2 labeling.Drug Treatments—Note that a 25 ng/ml TNFα concentration was chosen to favor analysis of the biphasic effect of the cytokine on [Ca2+]i transients and cell fractional shortening (16Cailleret M. Amadou A. Andrieu-Abadie N. Nawrocki A. Adamy C. Ait-Mamar B. Rocaries F. Best-Belpomme M. Levade T. Pavoine C. Pecker F.

Cell Physiol. 2002; 282: C1339-C1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).We checked that neutralizing antibodies Mab 225 (anti-TNFR1) and Mab 226 (anti-TNFR2) recognized rat TNFR1 (55 kDa) and rat TNFR2 (75 kDa) proteins, respectively, on Western blots performed under non reducing conditions. TNFR neutralization was obtained following incubation of cardiac myocytes for 30 min with 3 μg/ml of each antibody, before addition of TNFα. MAFP (4 μg/ml), L-NAME (1 mm), or PS-PKCζ (2.5 μm), were added 10 min before addition of TNFα.Myocardial TNFα, TNFR1, and TNFR2 Protein Expression Levels—Rat hearts were rapidly frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. Left ventricles (LV) were cut into 20-μm sections. Homogenates were prepared from five frozen sections of each LV by homogenization at 4 °C, in 200 μl of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), using disposable pestle/microtube devices (Fisher Scientific). After centrifugation at 4 °C at 20,000 × g for 20 min, sTNF-α, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 were quantified in the supernatant. The pellet, containing the membrane fraction, was resuspended by homogenization in the Hepes buffer containing protease inhibitors, and 1% Triton X-100. After 30 min of incubation on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and solubilized membrane-bound TNF-α, TNFR1, and TNFR2 in the supernatant were determined with double sandwich ELISA kits from R&D Systems (rat TNFα Quantikine, mouse sTNFR1, and mouse sTNFR2, respectively).Statistical Analysis—Results were analyzed by the unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney test using GraphPad Prism 4 software. Differences were considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05.RESULTSRespective Role of TNFR1 and TNFR2 on TNFα Effects on ROS Production, [Ca2+]i Transients and Cell Fractional Shortening and Cell Death—The amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients was measured in electrically stimulated adult rat cardiac myocytes, loaded with Fura 2-AM, alone or in combination with the ROS-sensitive fluorescent indicator, H2DCF-DA, in response to TNFα. TNFα (25 ng/ml) exerted a dual, early transient positive and late persistent negative effect on [Ca2+]i transients, with a 85 ± 42% increase over basal after 10 min followed by a 46 ± 13 decrease below basal after 30 min of TNFα perfusion (Fig. 1, C and A). Concurrently, as shown in a typical experiment performed in cardiac myocytes coloaded with Fura 2-AM and H2DCF-DA, TNFα elicited an early and sustained ROS production (Fig. 1A). Both early positive and late negative actions of TNFα on [Ca2+]i transient amplitude were associated with parallel early increase (not shown) and late decrease (Fig. 1A) in cell fractional shortening. To determine the respective role of TNFR1 and TNFR2 pathways in TNFα effects, neutralizing Mabs, specific for TNFR1 or TNFR2, were added to cardiac myocytes, 30 min before subsequent addition of TNFα. As shown in Fig. 1B, TNFR1- and TNFR2-Mabs exerted dose-dependent opposite effects on TNFα-induced ROS production, with a full inhibitory effect triggered in the presence of 3 μg/ml anti-TNFR1-Mab, contrasting with a maximal 286 ± 73% amplification elicited by 3 μg/ml anti-TNFR2-Mab. Neutralizing anti-TNFR1 Mab, which inhibited ROS production also abrogated the dual early positive and late negative effect of TNFα on the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients (Fig. 1C), uncovering a new persistent TNFα-induced positive increase in the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients, with a mean 55 ± 7% stimulation over basal after 30 min, associated with a parallel increase in cell fractional shortening (not shown). Likewise, in cardiac myocytes isolated from rats treated for 2 weeks with the antioxidant molecule, NAC, TNFα failed to induce ROS generation, producing 7 ± 2% of the maximal H2O2 response as compared with 35 ± 6% in cardiac myocytes isolated from control rats. In the absence of ROS production, TNFα elicited a persistent increase in the amplitude of [Ca2+]i transients, with a mean 58 ± 8% stimulation over basal after 30 min (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cardiac myocytes in vitro treated with neutralizing TNFR2-Mabs and exposed to TNFα did not only display increased ROS production (Fig. 1B) but also became rapidly unresponsive to electrical stimulation (Fig. 1C). The role of TNFR1 and TNFR2 was also evaluated on a long term effect of TNFα, i.e. cardiac myocyte survival. After 18 h in culture, counting of contracted, nonrod-shaped, dead cardiac myocytes indicated 13.5 ± 2% versus 54 ± 3% in the absence and in the presence of TNFα, respectively (Fig. 1D). Treatment with TNFR1-Mab suppressed the deleterious effect of TNFα and 11 ± 4 and 7 ± 2% nonrod-shaped cells were counted in the absence and in the presence of TNFα, respectively (Fig. 1D). In vivo treatment of rats with NAC before cell isolation also protected cardiac myocytes from TNFα-induced cell death since 18 ± 8 and 24 ± 4% nonrod-shaped cells were counted in the absence and in the presence of TNFα, respectively (Fig. 1D). In contrast, treatment with TNFR2-Mab exacerbated the deleterious effect of TNFα on cell survival with 17 ± 4 and 68 ± 6% nonrod-shaped cells counted in the absence and in the presence of TNFα, respectively. Taken together, these results supported the important role of the TNFR1/ROS pathway in cardiac myocytes but also highlighted a major protective effect of TNFR2 signaling. Interestingly, in regard to TNFα responses, the in vivo NAC treatment reproduced TNFR1-Mabs action, neutralizing TNFR1 and unmasking TNFR2. Note that, compared with control rats, NAC-treated rats displayed similar undetectable cardiac TNFα levels (<5 pg/mg prot) and comparable cardiac TNFR1 (6.3 ± 0.47 and 5.1 ± 0.4 pg/mg prot, respectively) and TNFR2 protein expression (12.4 ± 1.22 and 8.7 ± 0.5 pg/mg prot, respectively), giving a similar TNFR1/TNFR2 ratio (0.5 ± 0.01 and 0.58 ± 0.03, respectively). To characterize TNFR2-dependent mechanisms underlying the persistent positive effect of TNFα on [Ca2+] handling and cell fractional shortening, we used cardiac myocytes isolated from NAC-treated rats as a trick to silence TNFR1 pathways.In Cardiac Myocytes Isolated from NAC-treated Rats, TNFα Enhanced [Ca2+]i Transients and Cell Fractional Shortening via TNFR2-dependent Activation of ERK, MSK1, cPLA2, PKCζ, CaMKII, and Resultant Selective Phosphorylation of the Thr17-PLB Residue—As shown in Fig. 2, in cardiac myocytes isolated from NAC-treated rats, amplification of [Ca2+]i transients and cell fractional shortening, in response to a 30-min perfusion with TNFα, was unaffected by a pretreatment with anti-TNFR1-Mabs but blunted in the presence of neutralizing antibodies selectively directed against TNFR2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Among candidates likely to transduce positive TNFα responses, we focused on nitric-oxide synthase (NO synthase) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) activities. In fact, both NO and AA have been shown to elicit positive contractile responses, at low doses, in cardiac myocytes (19Amadou A. Nawrocki A. Best-Belpomme M. Pavoine C. Pecker F. Am. J. Physiol.

TNFα effects were unaffected by the presence of 1 mm L-NAME, the NO synthase inhibitor (not shown). In contrast, preincubation with the cPLA2 inhibitor, MAFP, suppressed TNFα-induced responses (Fig. 2, A and B). In the same line, inhibition o"

The affective response to carbon dioxide in healthy subjects was not clearly characterized yet.Sixty-four healthy subjects underwent a double inhalation of four mixtures containing respectively 0, 9, 17.5 and 35% CO(2) in compressed air, following a double blind, cross-over, randomized design. Affective responses were assessed according to DSM IV criteria for panic, using an Electronic Visual Analogue Scale and the Panic Symptom List. It was demonstrated that carbon dioxide challenges induced a dose dependent negative affect (p<0.0001). This affect was semantically identical to the DSM IV definition of panic. Older individuals were subjectively less sensitive to Carbon Dioxide (p<0.05).CO(2) induced affectivity may lay on a continuum with pathological panic attacks. Consistent with earlier suggestions that panic is a false biological alarm, the affective response to CO(2) may be part of a protective system triggered by suffocation and acute metabolic distress."
https://openalex.org/W2170374634,"Human sperm lack major histocompatibility class I molecules, making them susceptible to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells. Major histocompatibility class I negative tumor cells block NK cell lysis by expressing sufficient amounts of bisecting type N-glycans on their surfaces. Therefore, sperm could employ the same strategy to evade NK cell lysis. The total N-glycans derived from sperm were sequenced using ultrasensitive mass spectrometric and conventional approaches. Three major classes of N-glycans were detected, (i) high mannose, (ii) biantennary bisecting type, and (iii) biantennary, triantennary, and tetraantennary oligosaccharides terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences. Immunostaining of normal sperm showed that glycoproteins bearing Lewisy sequences are localized to the acrosome and not the plasma membrane. In contrast, defective sperm showed distinct surface labeling with anti-Lewisy antibody. The substantial expression of high mannose and complex type N-glycans terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences suggests that sperm glycoproteins are highly decorated with ligands for DC-SIGN. Based on previous studies, the addition of such carbohydrate signals should inhibit antigen-specific responses directed against sperm glycoproteins in both the male and female reproductive systems. Thus, the major N-glycans of human sperm are associated with the inhibition of both innate and adaptive immune responses. These results provide more support for the eutherian fetoembryonic defense system hypothesis that links the expression of carbohydrate functional groups to the protection of gametes and the developing human in utero. This study also highlights the usefulness of glycomic profiling for revealing potential physiological functions of glycans expressed in specific cell types.

This study also highlights the usefulness of glycomic profiling for revealing potential physiological functions of glycans expressed in specific cell types. Studies performed over the past four decades indicate that conditions are not optimal for human sperm in the female reproductive system (1Drobnis E.Z. Overstreet J.W. Oxf. Rev. Reprod. Biol. 1992; 14: 1-45PubMed Google Scholar). Women release neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes from the specialized mucosal surface of their cervix during the leukocyte reaction after coitus (2Pandya I.J. Cohen J. Fertil.

Increased immunological awareness related to histocompatibility and its implications for reproduction in eutherians initially raised concerns about how foreign human sperm are tolerated in the female reproductive system (4Medawar P. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1953; VII: 320-338Google Scholar). Early studies suggested that human sperm express MHC 3The abbreviations used are:MHCmajor histocompatibilityDC-SIGNdendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrinLacNAcGalβ1-4GlcNAcMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flightMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSNKnatural killerTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanateMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. class I molecules that define self, suggesting the possibility that histocompatibility based responses must be suppressed in the female reproductive tract (5Hutter H. Dohr G. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1998; 38: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, more recent studies confirm that sperm precursors down-modulate their MHC class I molecules, yielding mature sperm that are MHC class I negative cells (5Hutter H. Dohr G. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1998; 38: 101-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This absence enables these gametes to evade histocompatibility based responses mediated by MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (6Zinkernagel R.M. Doherty P.C. Nature. 1974; 248: 701-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). major histocompatibility dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin Galβ1-4GlcNAc matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry tandem MS natural killer tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid This lack of MHC class I molecules does not make sperm completely invulnerable to cell mediated responses, however. NK cells survey their potential targets for the expression of MHC class I molecules and lyse those cells that lack such markers (7Karre K. Scand. J. Immunol. 2002; 55: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, both human sperm and eggs represent potential targets for NK cells. This issue is very relevant for human sperm because of their potential exposure to NK cells during the leukocyte reaction (2Pandya I.J. Cohen J. Fertil. Steril. 1985; 43: 417-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 3Thompson L.A. Barratt C.L. Bolton A.E. Cooke I.D. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1992; 28: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like sperm, human tumor cells also lose their classical MHC class I molecules, especially as they become more metastatic (8Algarra I. Garcia-Lora A. Cabrera T. Ruiz-Cabello F. Garrido F. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2004; 53: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This transformation also makes them highly resistant to MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes but more sensitive to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (7Karre K. Scand. J. Immunol. 2002; 55: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Unlike sperm, a pathway for escaping natural cytotoxic responses has been established in tumor cells. Previous studies indicate that K562 erythroleukemia cell targets can avoid NK cell-mediated responses by increasing their surface expression of bisecting type N-glycans (9el Ouagari K. Teissie J. Benoist H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26970-26975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Ohnishi A. Ijuhin N. Nishiura T. Kanakura Y. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 412-418PubMed Google Scholar). Glycoprofiling analysis indicates that 35-92% of the oligosaccharides linked to polymorphic MHC class I molecules (human major histocompatibility A, B, and C) at their only glycosylation site (Asn-86) are biantennary bisecting type N-glycans (11Barber L.D. Patel T.P. Percival L. Gumperz J.E. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Bigge J.C. Wormwald M.R. Parekh R.B. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3275-3284PubMed Google Scholar). Tri- and tetraantennary bisecting type N-glycans are not present. These observations suggest that NK cells can also survey potential targets for biantennary bisecting type N-glycans in addition to MHC class I molecules. This type of carbohydrate-mediated recognition is not unprecedented. Previous studies suggest that Siglec7 is an NK cell inhibitory receptor that recognizes Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Ac-terminated glycans on target cells (12Avril T. North S.J. Haslam S.M. Willison H.J.

In this study the N-glycome of human sperm was characterized using high sensitivity mass spectrometric strategies. These experiments showed that sperm express substantial amounts of biantennary bisecting type N-glycans that are similar to those linked to classical MHC class I molecules (11Barber L.D. Patel T.P. Percival L. Gumperz J.E. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Bigge J.C. Wormwald M.R. Parekh R.B. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3275-3284PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, sperm also produce major amounts of biantennary, triantennary, and tetraantennary N-glycans terminated with Lewisx and Lewisy sequences. They include a novel tetraantennary N-glycan capped on each antenna with a Lewisy sequence. Lewisx and Lewisy sequences have previously been implicated in the suppression of antigen-driven responses (15Bergman M. Del Prete G. van Kooyk Y. Appelmelk B. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Bergman M.P. Engering A. Smits H.H. van Vliet S.J. van Bodegraven A.A. Wirth H.P. Kapsenberg M.L.

Lectin and antibody binding studies suggest that the highly fucosylated oligosaccharides are primarily localized to the acrosome rather than the plasma membrane in normal sperm. However, defective sperm show high levels of Lewisy expression on their surface. Materials—This study was approved by the Health Sciences Institutional Review Board, University of Missouri-Columbia. All research procedures involving materials originating from patients were conducted following the approved study protocol. Semen was obtained from healthy patients being tested for male-factor infertility of unknown origin. Specimens used for this study had normal semen parameters according to World Health Organization guidelines (17Organization World Health WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1999Google Scholar). Anti-Lewisy monoclonal antibody and all glycosidases except bovine testes β-galactosidase were obtained from Calbiochem. Reagents were prepared in Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) except as noted. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma except as noted. Isolation of Human Sperm for Structural Analyses and Lectin/Antibody Binding Studies—Motile sperm were isolated from semen by swim-up. Sperm were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was overlaid with protein-free modified Ham's F-10 basal medium-HEPES (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA). Tubes were incubated at a 30° angle for 60 min at 37 °C. After a 1-h migration, the overlying swim-up sperm were collected, washed twice in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at -20 °C. Sperm from a fertile sperm bank donor (Fairfax Cryobank, Fairfax, VA) were washed and used for lectin and antibody binding studies as previously described (18Ozanon C. Chouteau J. Sutovsky P. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 20: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Processing of the Human Sperm N-Glycans—Fourteen swim-up sperm preparations from individual donors were subjected to sonication, reduction, carboxymethylation, and tryptic digestion as described previously (19Sutton-Smith M. Wong N.K. Khoo K.H. Wu S.W. Yu S.Y. Patankar M.S. Easton R. Lattanzio F.A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Clark G.F. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 553-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Peptide N-glycosidase F digestion of the tryptic glycopeptides was carried out in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, for 20 h at 37 °C with 3 units of enzyme (Roche Applied Science). The released N-glycans were purified by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp.) as described (20Jang-Lee J. North S.J. Sutton-Smith M. Goldberg D. Panico M. Morris H. Haslam S. Dell A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purified native N-glycans were either subsequently derivatized or subjected to modifications before derivatization. To define structures with bisected GlcNAc, galactosylation using β-1,4 galactosyltransferase was carried out. A solution of 50 mm MOPS containing 45 μm UDP-galactose was prepared, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 using ammonia before the addition of 20 mm manganese (II) chloride 4-hydrate. Lyophilized purified native N-glycans was dissolved in 150 μl of this solution, and 10 μl of bovine milk β-1,4 galactosyltransferase (Calbiochem) was added. This enzymatic reaction was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C and lyophilized. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) hydrolysis was performed to remove α1-2- and α1-3-linked fucose as previously described (21Haslam S.M. Coles G.C. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Lyophilized purified native N-glycans were transferred from the glass tube to a microcentrifuge tube by re-dissolving them in 5% acetic acid and re-lyophilizing after transfer. Dryness of the sample was ensured before the careful addition of 50 μl of the 48% HF solution (Sigma-Aldrich). The tube containing the reaction was carefully sealed with Parafilm and then incubated on ice at 4 °C for 20 h. The reaction was terminated by drying the HF under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The sample was then redissolved in 5% acetic acid, transferred to a glass tube, and lyophilized before derivatization. Before mass spectrometric analyses, the native N-glycans were derivatized using the sodium hydroxide permethylation procedure as described previously (20Jang-Lee J. North S.J. Sutton-Smith M. Goldberg D. Panico M. Morris H. Haslam S. Dell A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Partially methylated alditol acetates were prepared from permethylated samples for gas chromatography-MS linkage analysis also as described (19Sutton-Smith M. Wong N.K. Khoo K.H. Wu S.W. Yu S.Y. Patankar M.S. Easton R. Lattanzio F.A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Clark G.F. Glycobiology. 2007; 17: 553-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MS and MS/MS Analyses of Permethylated Human Spermatozoa N-Glycans—MALDI-TOF MS data on permethylated samples were acquired in positive ion mode (M+Na)+ using a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer in the reflector mode with delayed extraction. Collision-activated decomposition-MS/MS data were acquired using a 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer. The collision energy was set to 1 kV, and argon was used as collision gas. Samples were dissolved in 10 μl of methanol, and 1 μl was mixed at a 1:1 ratio (v/v) with 2,5-dihydrobenzoic acid (20 mg/ml in 70% methanol in water) as matrix. Gas Chromatography-MS Linkage Analysis—Partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed using a PerkinElmer Clarus 500 instrument fitted with a RTX-5 column (30 m × 0.25-mm internal diameter, Restek Corp.) The sample was dissolved in hexanes and injected onto the column at 65 °C. The column was maintained at this temperature for 1 min and then heated to 290 °C at a rate of 8 °C per min. Lectin and Antibody Binding Studies—Sperm were settled on the lysine-coated microscopy coverslips, fixed in 2% formaldehyde, and processed with or without permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100 as described (22Sutovsky P. Schatten H. Methods in Molecular Biology. 253. Human Press, Totowa, NJ2004: 59-77Google Scholar). Fixed sperm were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Lewisy monoclonal antibody diluted 1:50, washed, and incubated for 40 min at room temperature with a mixture containing the TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) diluted 1/100. Acrosomal integrity was determined by the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Arachis hypogaea (peanut) lectin (Sigma) diluted 1/100 into TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM/4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mixture as described previously (18Ozanon C. Chouteau J. Sutovsky P. Hum. Reprod. 2005; 20: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Coverslips with the processed sperm were mounted on microscopy slides in VectaShield medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined under a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) with epifluorescence and differential interference contrast optics and a CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) operated by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). The figure plate was assembled in Adobe Photoshop. Strategy for Characterizing Human Sperm N-Glycans—Scheme 1 summarizes the structural analysis strategy employed. Briefly, sperm samples were homogenized in the presence of detergent, and the resulting extracts were reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. N-Glycans were released by peptide N-glycosidase F and permethylated. After Sep-Pak purification the methylated derivatives were characterized by MALDI-TOF profiling, MALDI-TOF/TOF sequencing, and gas chromatography-MS linkage analyses. These experiments were supplemented by MALDI profiling of the products of enzymatic galactosylation and hydrofluoric acid hydrolysis. MS Profiling of Human Sperm N-Glycans—MALDI-TOF MS analysis of permethylated human spermatozoa N-glycans was carried out on 14 purified sperm cell preparations from individual donors. A representative MS profile obtained from donor 001 is shown in Fig. 1. The structures shown in the annotations were assigned from compositional information provided by these MALDI data together with the results of the additional experiments described in the following sections. The most notable features of the data include (i) the presence of high mannose type N-glycans, (ii) the presence of biantennary bisected glycans, and (iii) substantial amounts of heavily fucosylated complex type N-glycans terminated with Lewisx and/or Lewisy sequences, the most abundant of which are biantennary. The bisected N-glycans have both non-fucosylated (m/z 2315) and fucosylated (m/z 2489) chitobiose core sequences but lack fucosylation on their antenna. Although the bisected glycans are only a very minor portion of the total glycan profile, they nevertheless make a significant contribution to the complex glycans that are expected to be on the sperm surface (see “Discussion” for acrosomal location of fucosylated glycans). All of the glycans carrying Lewisx and/or Lewisy antennae are core-fucosylated. Thus, biantennary core-fucosylated N-glycans with up to 4 antennal fucose residues are indicated by signals at m/z 2418, 2592, 2766, and 2940. Signals at m/z 3216, 3390, 3564, and 3738 are consistent with triantennary N-glycans with 3-6 fucose residues on their antennae. Remarkably, tetraantennary N-glycans are substituted with up to 8 fucose residues on their antenna (m/z 4013, 4187, 4361, and 4535). The following glycans were also observed: (i) several truncated structures lacking terminal galactose on one or more antenna (m/z 1591, 1836, 1907, 2040, 2081, 2111, and 2285); (ii) a core-fucosylated biantennary N-glycan (m/z 2244); (iii) triantennary N-glycans with or without core fucose (m/z 2519 and 2693); (iv) tetraantennary N-glycans with or without core fucose (m/z 2968 and 3142); (v) high mannose-type glycans from Man5GlcNAc2 to Man9GlcNAc2 (m/z 1580, 1784, 1988, 2192, and 2396). All 14 sperm preparations expressed Lewis sequences as well as low levels of bisected glycans (data not shown). Sialylated glycans were also present; see for example, m/z 2431 and/or 2605 in Figs. 1, 3, and 4. The full MALDI profiles for all preparations are shown in supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1. The abundance of sialylated components varied from a few percent in six of the preparations up to about 25% in a few preparations. Further analysis of these sialylated components was not pursued because their m/z signals were consistent with the N-glycans expressed by CD52, a sperm-associated glycophosphatidylinositol-linked N-glycopeptide that has already been rigorously characterized (23Schroter S. Derr P. Conradt H.S. Nimtz M. Hale G. Kirchhoff C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29862-29873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Future glycomic analyses of many more samples will be required to assess whether the differences in sialylation or fucosylation correlate with fertility. In addition, some minor glycans carrying poly-Galβ1-4GlcNAc antennae were observed.FIGURE 4Treatment of N-glycans with HF selectively removes terminal fucose from N-glycans associated with human sperm.

Representative data from analysis of m/z 2285, 2592, and 4535 are shown in Fig. 2, A, B, and C, respectively. Assignments of key signals are given in the insets. As shown in Fig. 2A, MS/MS analysis of m/z 2285, which has the composition Fuc1Hex4HexNAc5, gave a spectrum dominated by a fragment ion at m/z 2026 that corresponds to the loss of non-reducing terminal HexNAc. The signals at m/z 1822 (loss of a lacNAc antenna) and 1835 (loss of reducing-end fucosylated HexNAc) indicate that the glycan is core-fucosylated rather than capped with a Lewisx/a antenna. Fragment ions derived from multiple cleavages (m/z 1563, 1372, and 1113) and the lack of a fragment ion corresponding to the loss of a Lewisx/a antenna provide additional evidence for core fucosylation. Moreover, the MS/MS data show that there are two non-reducing GlcNAc residues as opposed to a lacdiNAc sequence (GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAc), which would be expected to give a fragment ion at m/z 1781 arising from loss of the two HexNAc residues as a single moiety. The MS/MS data cannot distinguish between the alternative possibilities of a bisected biantennary glycan or a non-bisected triantennary N-glycan (see the inset to Fig. 2A). MS/MS data for m/z 2592, which has the composition Fuc3Hex5HexNAc4, are consistent with a mixture of core-fucosylated biantennary glycans having either two Lewisx/a antennae or one Lewisy/b and one lacNAc antenna (Fig. 2B). Thus, fragment ions at m/z 660, 1318, 1505, 1751, and 1955 very clearly establish the presence of terminal Lewisx/a sequences, whereas signals at m/z 1781 and 2129 indicate that some glycans carry Lewisy/b together with an undecorated lacNAc antenna (see the inset). The relative abundance of the fragment ions indicates that the glycan with two Lewisx/a antennae is the major constituent. The signal at m/z 2386 corresponds to the loss of fucose from the 3-position of GlcNAc via β-elimination (20Jang-Lee J. North S.J. Sutton-Smith M. Goldberg D. Panico M. Morris H. Haslam S. Dell A. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 59-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), thus confirming the Lewisx, rather than the isomeric Lewisa structure. The predicted composition of m/z 4535 (Fuc9Hex7HexNAc6) suggests the presence of a core-fucosylated glycan carrying four Lewisy/b antennae. MS/MS analysis confirmed this assignment (Fig. 2C). Thus, a dominant fragment ion is observed at m/z 3724 that would be obtained by loss of any of the Lewisy/b antennae. The signal at m/z 2913 corresponds to separate losses of two Lewisy/b antennae, whereas the m/z 834 signal is the Lewisy/b ion itself. The m/z 4085 fragment ion confirms that the glycan is core-fucosylated. Similar to the m/z 2592 experiment, a significant signal corresponding to the loss of fucose by elimination from the 3-position of GlcNAc is observed (m/z 4329), thus confirming the Lewisy, rather than the isomeric Lewisb structure. The data are, thus, fully consistent with the proposed tetraantennary Lewisy structure. The experiment also clearly shows the power of the MS/MS methodology for defining antennae sequences in low abundance high mass components. Based on molecular ion abundances, the m/z 4535 component is only about 0.2% of the overall N-glycan repertoire. Confirmation of Bisecting-type N-Glycans—The ions at m/z 1907, 2081, 2111, 2285, 2315, and 2489 in the MALDI MS profiles have compositions consistent with either biantennary bisected structures or truncated triantennary N-glycans. The data obtained from MALDI MS/MS could not discriminate between these two possibilities. Therefore, to address this issue, an aliquot of the purified native N-glycans was incubated with β-galactosyltransferase and UDP-galactose before permethylation. The β-galactosyltransferase is able to catalyze the attachment of β1,4-linked galactose onto GlcNAc on truncated antenna(e) but not onto bisecting GlcNAc (24Narasimhan S. Freed J.C. Schachter H. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1694-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, components with truncated antenna(e) will be galactosylated resulting in a mass shift, whereas signals for the bisected components should be unchanged. Simple biantennary truncated glycans such as the m/z 1836, 1866, and 2040 components (see Fig. 1) were used as internal controls for assessing the efficiency of the reaction. Fig. 3 (upper panel) shows part of the spectrum for an aliquot of the N-glycans from donor 007 after direct MALDI MS profiling, and Fig. 3 (lower panel) shows the equivalent spectrum of this sample after treatment with β-galactosyltransferase and UDP-galactose. Note that m/z 1836 and 2040 have converted fully to m/z 2244, whereas m/z 1866 has shifted to m/z 2070 indicating that the reaction has been successful. In principle, if the signals at m/z 1907, 2111, and 2315 are non-bisected structures, they should all have shifted to m/z 2519. However, the signal at the m/z 2315 has not only remained but has increased slightly in abundance, thus providing evidence for the presence of bisected biantennary structures. The same principle applies to components at m/z 2081, 2285, and 2489. If non-bisected, they would have been converted to m/z 2693, but the signal at m/z 2489 is retained and has increased slightly in abundance. Linkage Analysis Confirms Bisected Structures—Preliminary experiments indicated that the glycan content of individual samples was insufficient for obtaining good quality linkage analysis data. Therefore, we pooled permethylated glycans from six donors for these studies. The linkage data (summarized in Table 1) are in accord with the MALDI data suggesting that high mannose and biantennary complex type structures are the major constituents. Key features of these data are as follows: (i) 3,4,6-linked Man confirms the presence of the minor bisected glycans; (ii) the high abundance of 2-linked mannose compared with 2,4- and 2,6-linked mannose is consistent with biantennary structures being the major complex glycans; (iii) 2,4- and 2,6-linked mannose are indicative of tri- and tetraantennary glycans; (iv) 3,4-GlcNAc is derived from the Lewis sequences, whereas the presence of 2-Gal supports the Lewisy assignments; (v) 4,6-GlcNAc is derived from the reducing end of the core-fucosylated glycans; (vi) 6-Gal is likely to be derived from sialylated components.TABLE 1GC-MS linkage analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates obtained after peptide N-glycosidase F digestionElution timeCharacteristic fragment ionsAssignmentRelative abundancemin16.96102, 115, 118, 131, 175Terminal fucose0.3318.45102, 118, 129, 145, 161, 162, 205Terminal mannose1.0018.72102, 118, 129, 145, 161, 162, 205Terminal galactose0.1719.62129, 130, 161, 1902-Linked mannose0.7319.78129, 130, 161, 1902-Linked galactose0.0520.4299, 102, 118, 129, 162, 189, 2336-Linked galactose0.0620.78130, 190, 2332,4-Linked mannose0.0521.22129, 130, 189, 1902,6-Linked mannose0.0321.36118, 129, 189, 2343,6-Linked mannose0.4121.84118, 3333,4,6-Linked mannose0.0722.30117, 129, 143, 145, 159, 203, 205Terminal GlcNAc0.0323.17117, 159, 143, 2334-Linked GlcNAc0.2524."

https://openalex.org/W2096067382,"Epistasis arising from physiological interactions between gene products often contributes to species differences, particularly those involved in reproductive isolation. In social organisms, phenotypes are influenced by the genotypes of multiple interacting individuals. In theory, social interactions can give rise to an additional type of epistasis between the genomes of social partners that can contribute to species differences. Using a full-factorial cross-fostering design with three species of closely related Temnothorax ants, I found that adult worker size was determined by an interaction between the genotypes of developing brood and care-giving workers, i.e. intergenomic epistasis. Such intergenomic social epistasis provides a strong signature of coevolution between social partners. These results demonstrate that just as physiologically interacting genes coevolve, diverge, and contribute to species differences, so do socially interacting genes. Coevolution and conflict between social partners, especially relatives such as parents and offspring, has long been recognized as having widespread evolutionary effects. This coevolutionary process may often result in coevolved socially-interacting gene complexes that contribute to species differences."
https://openalex.org/W1978975301,"Infertility affects approximately 20% of couples in Europe and in 50% of cases the problem lies with the male partner. The impact of damaged DNA originating in the male germ line on infertility is poorly understood but may increase miscarriage. Mouse models allow us to investigate how deficiencies in DNA repair/damage response pathways impact on formation and function of male germ cells. We have investigated mice with deletions of ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing gene 1), MSH2 (MutS homolog 2, involved in mismatch repair pathway), and p53 (tumour suppressor gene implicated in elimination of germ cells with DNA damage).We demonstrate for the first time that depletion of ERCC1 or p53 from germ cells results in an increased incidence of unrepaired DNA breaks in pachytene spermatocytes and increased numbers of caspase-3 positive (apoptotic) germ cells. Sertoli cell-only tubules were detected in testes from mice lacking expression of ERCC1 or MSH2 but not p53. The number of sperm recovered from epididymes was significantly reduced in mice lacking testicular ERCC1 and 40% of sperm contained DNA breaks whereas the numbers of sperm were not different to controls in adult Msh2 -/- or p53 -/- mice nor did they have significantly compromised DNA.These data have demonstrated that deletion of Ercc1, Msh2 and p53 can have differential but overlapping affects on germ cell function and sperm production. These findings increase our understanding of the ways in which gene mutations can have an impact on male fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2074916929,"PII is a highly conserved regulatory protein found in organisms across the three domains of life. In cyanobacteria and plants, PII relieves the feedback inhibition of the rate-limiting step in arginine biosynthesis catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK). To understand the molecular structural basis of enzyme regulation by PII, we have determined a 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of a complex formed between two homotrimers of PII and a single hexamer of NAGK from Arabidopsis thaliana bound to the metabolites N-acetylglutamate, ADP, ATP, and arginine. In PII, the T-loop and Trp22 at the start of the α1-helix, which are both adjacent to the ATP-binding site of PII, contact two β-strands as well as the ends of two central helices (αE and αG) in NAGK, the opposing ends of which form major portions of the ATP and N-acetylglutamate substrate-binding sites. The binding of Mg2+·ATP to PII stabilizes a conformation of the T-loop that favors interactions with both open and closed conformations of NAGK. Interactions between PII and NAGK appear to limit the degree of opening and closing of the active-site cleft in opposition to a domain-separating inhibitory effect exerted by arginine, thus explaining the stimulatory effect of PII on the kinetics of arginine-inhibited NAGK.

PII (GlnB) is now recognized as one of the most ancient and conserved signal transduction proteins known, with orthologs spread across the three domains of life (1Ninfa A.J. Atkinson M.R.

Rev. 2001; 65: 80-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Originally discovered as a factor necessary for the inactivation of Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase, PII is now known to play roles in the regulation of gene transcription, enzyme activity, and membrane channel function, all in response to cellular carbon, nitrogen, and energy status (3Moorhead G.B.G. Smith C.S. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 4Forchhammer K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 5Ninfa A.J.

PII interprets the metabolic status of the cell by directly binding to ATP and 2-ketoglutarate, and in certain bacteria, nitrogen status is sensed via covalent modification of PII. PII then directly interacts with a variety of proteins to regulate their function in response to the detected metabolic conditions. A eukaryotic PII protein has been discovered in several algae and higher plants. Arabidopsis thaliana PII is >50% identical to proteobacterial and cyanobacterial PII (7Hsieh M.H. Lam H.M. van de Loo F.J. Coruzzi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13965-13970Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), but unlike these orthologs, it does not appear to be regulated by phosphorylation or uridylylation in response to nitrogen metabolites (8Smith C.S. Morrice N.A. Moorhead G.B.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Plant PII has a conserved chloroplast transit peptide that is cleaved upon entry into the chloroplast, where PII performs its function. PII knock-out plants display altered carbon and nitrogen metabolite levels as well as increased sensitivity to nitrite (9Ferrario-Mery S. Bouvet M. Leleu O. Savino G. Hodges M. Meyer C. Planta. 2005; 223: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To date, the sole interacting protein discovered for plant PII is the chloroplast enzyme N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK), 2The abbreviations used are: NAGK, N-acetylglutamate kinase; SASA, solvent-accessible surface area. which catalyzes the second and rate-limiting step in the pathway of arginine biosynthesis (10Sugiyama K.

Meyer C. Hodges M. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2015-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have performed enzyme kinetics to define the role of PII in NAGK activity: although PII activates NAGK slightly, the primary purpose of binding appears to be relief of feedback inhibition by the downstream product arginine. Quite elegantly, the binding of PII changes the kinetics of NAGK from sigmoidal to hyperbolic in the presence of arginine. A similar form of regulation is also found in cyanobacteria (13Burillo S. Luque I. Fuentes I. Contreras A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3346-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Maheswaran M. Urbanke C. Forchhammer K. J. Biol.

Moorhead G.B.G. Ng K.K.-S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As in bacteria, plant PII forms a trimer with three protruding T-loops on one surface as well as a plant-specific N-terminal extension on the opposing surface that may be involved in protein-protein interactions and signaling. We have now determined the structure of A. thaliana PII bound to NAGK. This structure reveals for the first time the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of an enzyme by PII. Protein Expression and Purification—PII was expressed and purified as described previously (16Mizuno Y. Berenger B. Moorhead G.B.G. Ng K.K.-S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The NAGK gene from A. thaliana was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGACCGTATCAACACCACCT-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCTTTATCCAGTAATCATAGTTCCAGC-3′, Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the His-tagged NAGK expression clone in the pRSET-A plasmid (Invitrogen) as a template (11Chen Y.M.

The amplified product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and then ligated to pET-3a (Novagen) digested with the same enzymes. The expression plasmid was transformed into Rosetta-gami pLysS cells (Novagen). Four 1-liter cultures of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and chloramphenicol were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for 20 h at 25 °C. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 160 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg of DNase, and 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysed by sonication. The extract was clarified by centrifugation, diluted 1:5 (v/v) with Buffer B (20 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.0), 1 mm NaEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), and loaded at 1 ml/min onto a blue dye column (5 × 2.5 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was washed with 80 ml of Buffer B containing 250 mm NaCl, and 8-ml fractions were eluted using Buffer B containing 1.2 m NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and precipitated with ammonium sulfate between 40 and 55% saturation. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation, dissolved with Buffer C (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm NaEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), dialyzed overnight against Buffer C containing 30 mm NaCl, and loaded at 1 ml/min onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer C containing 20 mm NaCl. NAGK was eluted at ∼0.15 m NaCl using a 0.02-1 m NaCl linear gradient and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm NaEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The purity of NAGK was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and NAGK was concentrated to 9 mg/ml using Amicon Ultrafree-15 centrifugal concentrators. Structure Determination of the PII·NAGK Complex—NAGK and PII were independently concentrated and mixed at a 2:1 mass ratio to produce a mixture containing 40 mm l-arginine, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ADP, 10 mm N-acetylglutamate, 4 mg/ml NAGK, and 2 mg/ml PII. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature by mixing 2 μl of the protein mixture with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 8.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.1 m NaHEPES (pH 7.0), 0.4 m trimethylamine N-oxide, 50 mm l-arginine, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 12% (w/v) glycerol. This mixture was seeded with small crystals from a previous crystallization trial under the same conditions and equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution. The crystallizations were dehydrated by adding 50 μl of 80% (w/v) glycerol to the well solution on days 7 and 15 after the initial setup. On day 17, 100 μl of 80% (w/v) glycerol was added. On day 18, a single crystal (cubic shape with edges of ∼0.15 mm) was mounted on a polyimide loop (MiTeGen) and flash-cooled at 100 K with a nitrogen gas stream (Oxford Cryostream). The crystal was stored in liquid nitrogen and transferred to Canadian Light Source beamline CMCF-1 08-ID-1 for data collection using a MarCCD detector. Data were measured on 331 images with 1-s exposures and 0.5° rotational steps. Autoindexing, examination of systematic absences, and scaling statistics indicated that the most likely space group was P213, with unit cell parameters a = b = c = 171.13 Å and α = β = γ = 90°. Data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Berenger B. Moorhead G.B.G. Ng K.K.-S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and the structure of NAGK from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (∼45% sequence identity; Protein Data Bank code 2BUF) (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as search models. The solvent content of the crystal was calculated to be 73% (Vm = 1.9 Å3/Da) if two PII and two NAGK protomers are present in the asymmetric unit (22Matthews B.W. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement calculations were carried out using PHASER (23Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), yielding only a weak solution for the placement of two copies of the NAGK search model (z = 6.0). After refining and fixing the solutions of these two NAGK protomers, a very strong solution for the placement of two copies of the PII protomer (z = 33) was obtained, allowing for the calculation of good electron density maps for model building (R = 0.37 and dmin = 2.6). REFMAC (Version 5.2.0019) (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) was used for refinement calculations, and Xfit (25McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) was used to build models into electron density maps. PROCHECK (26Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the stereochemical parameters in the models. Some residual electron density was noticed near the thiol group of Cys65 in both protomers of NAGK. This electron density may signify the presence of a covalent adduct for which we were unable to devise a sensible model. Structure of the PII·NAGK Complex—To understand the molecular mechanisms of enzyme regulation by PII, we determined the three-dimensional structure of a complex formed between two homotrimers of PII and a single hexamer of NAGK. The structure of the PII·NAGK complex was solved by molecular replacement using the structures of PII from A. thaliana (Protein Data Bank code 2O66) (16Mizuno Y. Berenger B. Moorhead G.B.G. Ng K.K.-S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and NAGK from P. aeruginosa (Protein Data Bank code 2BUF) (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) as search models. Although many different crystal forms were obtained under a wide range of conditions, well diffracting crystals were obtained only in the presence of Mg2+, ADP, N-acetylglutamate, and arginine. All four of these ligands are bound to NAGK and are well defined in electron density maps. Surprisingly, ATP and not ADP is clearly bound to PII. Because no ATP was added during purification or crystallization, the ATP was likely bound to PII when the protein was produced from E. coli. The asymmetric unit of the PII·NAGK complex crystal (space group P213) contains two protomers of NAGK and two protomers of PII. A crystallographic 3-fold rotational symmetry axis coincides with the molecular 3-fold axis of the complex to generate the dodecameric complex that forms in solution (Fig. 1). The overall dimensions of the complex are ∼115 × 105 × 105 Å, with the longest dimension spanning along the 3-fold rotational axis reaching from the N-terminal segments of one PII trimer to the N-terminal segments of the second PII trimer. Each PII trimer forms intimate interactions with opposing faces of the NAGK hexamer, with each PII protomer contacting a single separate NAGK protomer (Fig. 2A). Only two short stretches of PII contact NAGK: Trp22 at the end of the α1-helix and residues in the T-loop of PII contact residues on helices αE and αG as well as strands β6 and β7 on the side of NAGK opposite the active-site cleft. A relatively small amount of solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) (532-616 Å2) for each PII protomer is buried upon complex formation, and each PII trimer appears to bind independently on opposite faces of the NAGK hexamer. This constitutes 7% of the total SASA for each PII protomer and 5% of the total SASA for each NAGK protomer. Given the extensive interactions between separate protomers in each PII trimer and NAGK hexamer, however, the total amount of SASA (1600-1850 Å2) buried upon binding of a single PII trimer to the NAGK hexamer represents 11% of the total SASA for the PII trimer and 3% for the NAGK hexamer. Each PII trimer binds independently on opposite faces of the NAGK hexamer. The structures of the two PII trimers in the complex appear to be very similar to the structure of free PII, with the exception of the T-loop (residues 49-66) and the C-terminal segment (residues 125-134). The T-loop is mostly disordered in free PII, but it is well ordered and forms numerous contacts with NAGK in the complex. Most of the residues interacting between NAGK and PII are conserved in all plants and cyanobacteria, confirming the generality of the binding interactions seen in the A. thaliana complex (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). The side chains of Arg56 and Ser60 in the T-loop of PII form hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl and amide groups of Val159 and Val162 in NAGK (Fig. 2). In addition, electrostatic interactions are formed by the side chains of Arg56 and Glu61 with the oppositely charged side chains of Glu201 and Arg145 of NAGK. The main chain amide group of Glu61 also forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Ala160. Apart from the T-loop, the side chain of the plant-specific Trp22 at the N terminus of the first α-helix of PII forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl group of Ala264 of NAGK as well as van der Waals contacts with Gln265 and Gly266 (Fig. 2C). The PII·NAGK complex also reveals that the NAGK hexamer consists of dimers arranged about a 3-fold rotational axis, as seen previously in the bacterial and archaeal NAGK hexamers from P. aeruginosa and Thermotoga maritima (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Each NAGK protomer adopts an αβ-fold characteristic of the amino acid kinase family, consisting of an N-terminal domain that binds N-acetylglutamate and a C-terminal domain that binds the substrate ATP (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 27Ramon-Maiques S. Marina A. Gil-Ortiz F. Fita I. Rubio V. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 329-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Each protomer is related to adjacent protomers through 2-fold rotational axes lying at two distinct interfaces, A and B. Interface A is formed primarily by packing interactions between the edge of the central 8-stranded β-sheet, an adjacent loop, and two flanking α-helices (Fig. 1C). Interface B is formed between the N-terminal helices of adjacent protomers (Fig. 1D). Interface A appears to be found in all bacterial and archaeal NAGK enzymes, but interface B and the N-terminal helix seem to be found only in organisms in which NAGK exists as a hexamer and arginine acts an allosteric inhibitor (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), as in plants (11Chen Y.M. Ferrar T.S. Lohmeier-Vogel E.

As seen previously in the NAGK hexamers from P. aeruginosa and T. maritima, arginine binds near the C-terminal end of the N-terminal helix and may mediate inhibition by stabilizing an open conformation of NAGK (Fig. 1D), as described further below. Structural Basis for the ATP-dependent Binding of NAGK by PII—The structure of the PII·NAGK complex reveals for the first time the molecular basis for the regulation of an enzyme by PII. In bacteria, Archaea, and plants, PII regulates key metabolic enzymes by integrating signals dependent on the cell's energy, carbon, and nitrogen status. Energy status appears to be reflected in PII proteins primarily through the binding of ATP. The PII·NAGK complex strikingly reveals the molecular mechanism through which ATP binding modulates the regulation of an effector enzyme. The binding of ATP to PII clearly favors a conformation of the T-loop that interacts with NAGK. First, the adenosine base of ATP exerts important changes on the structure of PII and its interactions with NAGK. The base lies in a hydrophobic pocket that is occupied by Met126 in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3). Displacement of Met126 from the ATP-binding pocket allows the movement of the C-terminal segment away from an area occupied by the T-loop in the PII·NAGK complex. As noted previously, Met126 is perfectly conserved in plants and lies in a C-terminal segment found only in plant PII (16Mizuno Y. Berenger B. Moorhead G.B.G. Ng K.K.-S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1477-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The coupled changes in the conformations of the C-terminal segment and the T-loop may be essential components of an ATP-dependent switch found only in plants. In prokaryotic PII, the binding of the adenosine base may displace a shorter C-terminal segment in a similar manner that is also likely involved with conformational signaling. The triphosphate group of ATP also plays a key role in promoting a conformation of the T-loop that favors interactions with NAGK. The triphosphate group coordinates Mg2+ in conjunction with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly48 at the base of the T-loop to promote the conformation of the T-loop required for interactions with NAGK (Fig. 3C). Notably, Gly48 is conserved in PII from bacteria, Archaea, and all eukaryotes (supplemental Fig. S2). A previous mutagenesis study in E. coli has also revealed that the replacement of the equivalent residue, Gly37, with Ala can disrupt PII interactions with bacterial receptors as well as the binding of 2-ketoglutarate and ATP (28Jiang P. Zucker P. Atkinson M.R. Kamberov E.S. Tirasophon W. Chandran P. Schefke B.R. Ninfa A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4342-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The binding of the triphosphate moiety of ATP in A. thaliana PII differs significantly from the metal-independent modes of ATP-binding seen in PII·ATP complexes from E. coli (29Xu Y. Cheah E. Carr P.D. van Heeswijk W.C. Westerhoff H.V. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Xu Y. Carr P.D. Huber T. Vasudevan S.G. Ollis D.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2028-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus (31Sakai H. Wang H. Takemoto-Hori C. Kaminishi T. Yamaguchi H. Kamewari Y. Terada T. Kuramitsu S. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as well as GlnK·ADP·AmtB complexes from E. coli (32Conroy M.J. Durand A. Lupo D. Li X.D. Bullough P.A. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33Gruswitz F. O'Connell III, J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the Mg2+-dependent mode of ATP binding is similar to the metal-dependent binding mode seen in PII from Methanococcus jannaschii (34Yildiz O. Kalthoff C. Raunser S. Kuhlbrandt W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The positions of the triphosphate moiety as well as Mg2+ in both A. thaliana and M. jannaschii superimpose closely. However, the orientation of the carbonyl oxygen of Gly48 coordinating Mg2+ in A. thaliana differs dramatically. In M. jannaschii, the peptide bond following Gly48 is flipped in the opposite direction, and the carbonyl oxygen does not interact with Mg2+. These structural observations indicate that the binding of Mg2+ to the phosphate groups of ATP may contribute to the effects of ATP binding on the structure of the receptor-binding surface of PII. As observed previously, the binding of ATP to PII also allows 2-ketoglutarate to interact with PII, thereby integrating the carbon signal after assessment of energy status (5Ninfa A.J. Jiang P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 35Smith C.S. Weljie A.M. Moorhead G.B.G. Plant J. 2003; 33: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As noted above, it is surprising that ATP and not ADP is clearly bound to PII. A refined omit electron density map reveals that the entire ATP molecule is well ordered when bound to PII (Fig. 3D). Three regions of extremely strong refined omit electron density (>14σ) correspond perfectly with the refined positions of the phosphorus atoms in the triphosphate moiety of ATP. Because ATP was not added during purification or crystallization, the ATP was likely bound to PII when the protein was produced from E. coli. Open and Closed Conformations of NAGK Protomers—An unusual feature of the PII·NAGK complex is that the two protomers of NAGK found in the asymmetric unit adopt dramatically different conformations. Protomer A, which is found in the “lower” (green) trimeric ring when the complex is viewed as in Fig. 1, adopts an “open” conformation compared with protomer B. When the two conformations are compared, the N-terminal domain (residues 15-211) of protomer A is rotated by 11° away from the C-terminal domain (residues 212-295). Fig. 4 is viewed down this rotational axis, as identified by the program DynDom (36Hayward S. Lee R.A. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which passes between the two key hinge residues Leu211 and Ile212. The closed conformation of NAGK brings the two substrates, N-acetylglutamate and ATP, closer together. During the process of crystallization, ADP was added as a product/inhibitor to avoid the formation of a mixture of substrates and products if ATP were present. The closed conformation brings the β-phosphate of ADP within 5.5 Å of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of N-acetylglutamate. In the open conformation, however, the distance between these two groups increases by 1.5 Å. In addition, hydrogen bonds donated by the side chain amide group of Asn194 and the main chain amide group of Gly77 to the carboxylate oxygen phosphate acceptor appear to be formed only in the closed conformation of the substrate-binding site for NAGK. Previously determined structures of NAGK from bacteria and Archaea also indicate that a mixture of conformational states with variable degrees of domain closure can be found in different protomers within the same crystal as well as in protomers from different crystals (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This suggests that variable degrees of domain closure may be an intrinsic property of NAGK structure that is critical to function. It seems likely that the closed conformation promotes the formation of the transition state, as has been seen in the related NAGK enzymes from bacteria and Archaea (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 37Gil-Ortiz F. Ramon-Maiques S. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, the more open conformations likely promote the entry of substrates and the release of products. Comparisons with E. coli GlnK·AmtB Complexes—The structure of the PII·NAGK complex reveals a number of surprising similarities to and differences from with the recently determined structures of GlnK bound to the AmtB ammonium transporter (32Conroy M.J. Durand A. Lupo D. Li X.D. Bullough P.A. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 33Gruswitz F. O'Connell III, J. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). At present, the GlnK·AmtB complex is the only other three-dimensional structure of a complex containing a PII-like protein. In both complexes, the T-loop of PII provides the focal point of interaction, and the trimeric structure of PII matches the trimeric structure of the binding partner perfectly. Despite the overall similarities, however, the details of interactions between the T-loop and NAGK differ dramatically from the interactions seen with AmtB. The T-loop of E. coli GlnK in the AmtB complex is nearly fully extended along the 3-fold rotational axis of the GlnK trimer. In contrast, the T-loop of A. thaliana PII forms a right-angled kink as it extends from the surface of the PII trimer, pointing roughly perpendicular to the 3-fold rotational axis of the trimer (Fig. 1D). The dramatic differences in T-loop conformation seen in the two different complexes indicate that the flexibility of the T-loop may be exploited in different ways to interact with a wide range of target effector enzymes and transporters. Relief of Arginine Inhibition by the Binding of PII—Arginine is the final product of the pathway in which NAGK resides as the second but rate-limiting step. Arginine is a feedback inhibitor and binds to NAGK between the N-terminal α-helix and the C-terminal domain at a site near interface B of adjacent protomers (Fig. 1D). This binding site is formed primarily by a pocket in the C-terminal domain of NAGK that is similar to the binding site seen previously in the arginine-sensitive archaeal NAGK enzyme from T. maritima (21Ramon-Maiques S. Fernandez-Murga M.L. Gil-Ortiz F. Vagin A. Fita I. Rubio V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 695-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Comparisons of the structures of arginine-free NAGK from P. aeruginosa and arginine-bound NAGK from T. maritima indicate that the binding of arginine may stabilize a more open conformation of NAGK by forming bridging interactions between the C-terminal domain and the N-terminal helix. The high degree of similarity in sequence and structure between the plant and archaeal NAGK enzymes suggests that the binding of arginine may also stabilize a more open conformation in plant NAGK. If arginine binding promotes or stabilizes the more open conformation of NAGK, then arginine inhibition may result from structurally destabilizing the closed conformation that is necessary for transition state formation. The binding of PII to NAGK in plants (11Chen Y.M. Ferrar T.S. Lohmeier-Vogel E. Morrice N. Mizuno Y. Berenger B. Ng K.K.-S. Muench D.G. Moorhead G.B.G. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) has been observed to relieve the inhibition caused by arginine. The structure of the PII·NAGK complex suggests a mechanism by which PII may relieve this inhibition. PII can interact similarly with both open and closed conformations of NAGK. The location of the PII-binding site is found on the side of NAGK opposite the opening of the active-site cleft and nearly perfectly centered on the axis of rotation for separating the two domains (Fig. 4). This location allows PII to interact with a range of NAGK conformations in a similar manner because relatively small changes arise in this region of the enzyme. Thus, PII binding may not strongly favor either the open or the closed conformation of NAGK, both of which are necessary for normal enzyme function. Even though PII can interact similarly with both open and closed conformations of NAGK, the PII·NAGK structure suggests that PII may restrict NAGK from accessing more extreme conformations. The arginine-inhibited structure of NAGK from T. maritima reveals a larger degree of separation between the N- and C-terminal domains compared with the open conformation of NAGK seen in the plant PII·NAGK complex as well as an additional opening of a flap-like lid region (residues 86-102 in A. thaliana and residues 71-87 in T. maritima) (Fig. 4C). Both of these changes appear to lead to a further displacement of the adjacent strands β6 and β7. Because these strands contain the side chains of Arg145 and the main chain groups of Val159 and Ala160, which form key interactions with PII (Fig. 2), these interactions may limit larger degrees of domain separation and movements of the lid region of NAGK. If these more extreme conformational changes are nonproductive catalytic states that may be promoted by the binding of arginine, then the constraints imposed by PII binding may counter this effect and relieve inhibition. Examining the kinetics of NAGK and PII mutants targeting interactions seen in the NAGK complex and determining the structures of A. thaliana NAGK in the presence of arginine would help test the validity of this hypothesis.

DNA synthesis. In the former pool dNTPs are produced from ribonucleotides by the de novo pathway, where ribonucleotide reductase and thymidylate synthase are key enzymes, and by phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides via the salvage pathway. mt dNTPs derive from the salvage of deoxyribonucleosides catalyzed by mt kinases and from import of deoxyribonucleotides preformed in the cytosol. Although the mt inner membrane is impermeable to nucleotides, cytosolic and mt dNTP pools communicate via specific transporters. mt carriers for deoxyribonucleotides have been cloned in yeasts (1Marobbio C.M.

Nuclear DNA synthesis is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle. Ribonucleotide reductase is induced at the transition between G1 and S so that de novo synthesis of cytosolic dNTPs starts concurrently with nuclear DNA replication when the request for precursors is high. Also cytosolic thymidine kinase (TK1) is induced in S phase and contributes to the production of dTTP. Thus cytosolic dNTP pools expand in S phase supporting the needs of nuclear DNA polymerases and then strongly decrease at the exit of mitosis as anaphase-specific proteolysis removes R2, the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (8Chabes A.L. Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3925-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and TK1 (9Ke P.Y. Chang Z.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A second stable R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase has been recently discovered and named p53R2, because its expression is regulated by the tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor involved in the DNA damage response (10Tanaka H. Arakawa H. Yamaguchi T. Shiraishi K. Fukuda S. Matsui K. Takei Y. Nakamura Y. Nature. 2000; 404: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 11Nakano K. Balint E. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4283-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, p53R2 is present at a low level also in undamaged cycling cells and is the only small subunit of RNR present in quiescent fibroblasts in culture together with R1 (12Hakansson P. Hofer A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7834-7841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar); the large subunit is needed to make a functional ribonucleotide reductase. Thus it has now emerged that cells outside S phase have the potential to carry out some de novo synthesis of dNTPs. The level of such synthesis is very low compared with that in cycling cells (13Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Hakansson P. Thelander L. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16820-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), in agreement with the small size of cytosolic dNTP pools in resting cells. However, the R1-p53R2 variant of ribonucleotide reductase fulfills an important function in vivo, as demonstrated by the mtDNA depletion arising in the skeletal muscle of patients with inactivating mutations in RRM2B, the gene coding for p53R2, and in several organs of knockout mice (14Bourdon A. Minai L. Serre V. Jais J.P. Sarzi E. Aubert S. Chretien D. de Lonlay P. Paquis-Flucklinger V. Arakawa H. Nakamura Y. Munnich A. Rotig A. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 776-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). mtDNA synthesis is not limited to the S phase of the cell cycle but takes place also in differentiated cells (15Magnusson J. Orth M. Lestienne P. Taanman J.W. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 289: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) where nuclear DNA replication has stopped. The intramitochondrial salvage pathway for dNTP synthesis starts with the phosphorylation of imported deoxyribonucleosides by the two mt deoxyribonucleoside kinases, thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase, two constitutively expressed enzymes encoded by two nuclear genes (16Johansson M. Karlsson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7258-7262Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Johansson M. Karlsson A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8454-8458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The two enzymes have substrate specificities that allow for the phosphorylation of all four deoxyribonucleosides required for DNA synthesis. Isotope-flow experiments with radioactive deoxyribonucleosides indicate that the intramitochondrial salvage pathway is constitutively active (7Ferraro P. Pontarin G. Crocco L. Fabris S. Reichard P.

Indeed, until the discovery of the pathology linked to p53R2 deficiency, it was considered the main provider of dNTPs for mtDNA replication in quiescent and differentiated cells where the cytosolic pool is very low. We have recently shown that, in cultured human fibroblasts, the size of mt dNTP pools also changes with the proliferation state of the cells, remaining within a few percentage points of the cytosolic pools (7Ferraro P.

The quantitative changes of mt dNTP pools from cycling to quiescent cells are accompanied by a stronger relative decrease of mt dTTP that alters the proportions of the four dNTPs in the mt pool. The specific behavior of thymidine triphosphate underscores the existence of a separate regulation of this precursor and confirms the importance of dTTP for the maintenance of genomic stability. Two mt diseases in humans depend on mutations of genes involved in thymidine metabolism that by altering the mt dTTP pool destabilize the mt genome. Mutations of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), a catabolic enzyme that degrades thymidine and deoxyuridine in the cytosol, cause mt neurogastroencephalomyopathy, a multisystemic syndrome characterized by multiple mutations, deletions, and depletion of mtDNA (19Nishino I. Spinazzola A. Hirano M. Science. 1999; 283: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The enzyme loss of function leads to an increased mt dTTP pool that reduces the fidelity of mtDNA synthesis. The acute myopathic form of mtDNA depletion syndrome is instead associated with mutations in TK2 and is attributed to muscle-specific shortage of mt dTTP (20Saada A. Shaag A. Mandel H. Nevo Y. Eriksson S. Elpeleg O. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). A similar tissue-specific mtDNA depletion is caused by deoxyguanosine kinase deficiency, where the target tissues are instead liver and brain (21Mandel H. Szargel R. Labay V. Elpeleg O. Saada A. Shalata A. Anbinder Y. Berkowitz D. Hartman C. Barak M. Eriksson S. Cohen N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Thus, although in both cases the genetic defect is present in all somatic cells, the mt phenotype becomes manifest only in selected tissues, suggesting that the unaffected cells can compensate the mt enzyme deficiency by extramitochondrial pathways. TK2 shares with TK1 the preferred substrates, i.e. thymidine and deoxyuridine, and in addition phosphorylates deoxycytidine, which is however a much better substrate for the cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (22Arner E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Although the two thymidine kinases have the same affinity for thymidine at substrate concentrations below 10 μm (Km values of ∼0.5 μm), the Vmax is 20-fold higher for TK1 (23Munch-Petersen B. Cloos L. Tyrsted G. Eriksson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9032-9038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cycling cells where TK1 is expressed, TK2 accounts only for a small percentage of total TK activity (5Berk A.J. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2722-2729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Franzolin E. Rampazzo C. Perez-Perez M.J. Hernandez A.I. Balzarini J. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In non-cycling cells instead, TK2 is the only thymidine kinase and in cultured quiescent fibroblasts its activity is up-regulated (24Franzolin E. Rampazzo C. Perez-Perez M.J. Hernandez A.I. Balzarini J. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that its role becomes more important when dTTP synthesis in the cytosol is turned down. We previously showed that both TK1 and TK2 participate with two related deoxyribonucleotidases, cdN and mdN, in two futile or “substrate” cycles that in the cytosol and mitochondria, respectively, modulate the relative concentrations of thymidine and its monophosphate, dTMP, keeping under control the dTTP pools in the two compartments (25Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Rampazzo C. Ferraro P. Pontarin G. Fabris S. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17019-17026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both TK2 and mdN are constitutively expressed (7Ferraro P. Pontarin G. Crocco L. Fabris S. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24472-24480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Arner E.S. Eriksson S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 67: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar); therefore, the activity of TK2 is curbed by that of the deoxynucleotidase that catalyzes the opposite reaction. With the experiments presented here we explored the role of TK2 in the maintenance of the mt dTTP pool in relation to that of other two players in the metabolic network: ribonucleotide reductase and TP. We wished to find out under which conditions TK2 function is limiting for the synthesis of mt dTTP and outline a possible basis for the tissue-specific phenotype of TK2 deficiency. Our approach was to silence the TK2 expression by RNA interference, in cycling cells expressing TK1 or devoid of TK1 and in quiescent cells where both TK1 and the S-phase-specific ribonucleotide reductase are inactive, and to measure mt dTTP pool size and the incorporation of exogenous thymidine into this pool. In quiescent fibroblasts we dissected the functional interactions of R1-p53R2 ribonucleotide reductase and TP with TK2 by chemically inhibiting the enzymes in TK2-silenced and non-silenced cells. The availability of thymidine in the extracellular compartment was an important factor in the regulation of the small dTTP pool of quiescent cells. Cell Lines and Cell Growth—The established human tumor cell lines HEK 293, Ost TK1–, and HOS TK1+ and the human skin fibroblast lines C63 and C72 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 7–10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. To maintain quiescent cultures of human fibroblasts we transferred contact inhibited cells to medium with 0.1% dialyzed FCS. All cell lines were periodically checked for mycoplasma contamination by the Venor GEM PCR-based method (Minerva Biolabs). We determined cell numbers with a Coulter counter and cell-cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Preparation of Plasmids for Expression of shRNAs and Transfection Protocols—For the down-regulation of TK2 by RNAi we chose seven oligonucleotide sequences present in TK2 cDNA (Imgenex). We produced in vitro the corresponding siRNAs with the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit from Ambion and tested their ability to silence TK2 expression in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. After 48 h of transfection we extracted total cellular RNA from siRNA-transfected and mock transfected cultures to measure the level of TK2 mRNA by real-time PCR (see below). We chose the two most effective sequences, KF (AAGGTCTATGGCTCATGTCTG) and KG (AAATGCCTGCTGCTGCCAAGT), and designed two 64-mer oligonucleotides each containing inverted repeats of the target sequence separated by a 9-bp linker. We cloned the two oligonucleotides in the tetracycline-inducible plasmid pTER (27van de Wetering M. Oving I. Muncan V. Pon Fong M.T. Brantjes H. van Leenen D. Holstege F.C. Brummelkamp T.R. Agami R. Clevers H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and controlled each construct by sequencing. To obtain inducible expression of the shRNAs we prepared a stable clone of Ost TK1– cells transfected with plasmid pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen), coding for a tetracycline repressor that is inactivated by tetracycline. We selected stable clones of pcDNA6/TR Ost TK1– cells in the presence of 6 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). We tested the ability of the clones to produce the repressor by transiently transfecting them with reporter plasmid pcDNA4TO/LacZ (Invitrogen) in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma). One positive clone named Ost 1.25 was chosen for further work. To down-regulate TK2 in TK1– cells we prepared inducible clones from cultures of clone Ost 1.25 transfected with the pTER-KF and pTER-KG constructs, whereas in the case of HOS TK1+ cells we prepared constitutive clones without repressor. The protocols for plasmid transfections and isolation of clones were those described previously (26Rampazzo C. Ferraro P. Pontarin G. Fabris S. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17019-17026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Transfections with siRNAs—We employed two pools of four different siRNAs obtained from Dharmacon, the siGENOME SMART pool reagent to target the mRNA of human TK2 (NM_004614) and the siCONTROL Non-targeting siRNA pool as a negative control. Skin fibroblast were seeded at 0.75 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FCS and cultured for 4 days until ∼90% confluent. Transfection was done by adding siRNAs (final concentration, 50 nm) mixed with 0.036 ml of DharmaFECT 1 in 1.8 ml of Opti-MEM to 7.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% dialyzed FCS without antibiotics. Three days later the medium was diluted 1:1 with fresh medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed FCS, and the cells were kept for an additional 4 days in the presence of 25 nm siRNAs. The same cultures underwent a second transfection with 25 nm siRNAs in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% dialyzed FCS, and the isotope experiments were performed 3 days later. By this protocol the cells remained in the presence of the siRNAs for a total of 10 days without replating. mRNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription, PCR, and Real-time PCR—We extracted total RNA from 0.5 × 106 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and Phase Lock gel Heavy (Eppendorf, Italy). We checked the quality of the RNA samples by capillary electrophoresis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies). We prepared cDNAs by reverse transcription as described (26Rampazzo C. Ferraro P. Pontarin G. Fabris S. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17019-17026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR assays were performed in 96-well optical plates with a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the following parameters: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 60 s at 60 °C. The amplification reactions were in 0.025 ml containing 0.2 μm primers in PCR buffer (Power Sybr Green PCR master mix, Applied Biosystems) and the cDNA sample. To standardize the expression of individual target genes in HOS TK1+ and Ost TK1– cells we chose as reference hydroxymethylbilane synthase that was expressed at a level similar to TK2. In the case of skin fibroblasts we used as reference succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A that maintained the same expression level during cell proliferation and quiescence. Primers for the three subunits of human ribonucleotide reductase, p53, succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A, hydroxymethylbilane synthase were from previous publications (28Jordheim L.P.

We performed each real-time PCR assay with three different amounts of cDNA in triplicate to control the amplification efficiency of each gene by standard curves. Each cDNA preparation was analyzed at least three times. We employed the comparative Ct method (32Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25871) Google Scholar) for data processing. Immunoblotting—We prepared and quantified cell protein lysates as described by Pontarin et al. (13Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Hakansson P. Thelander L. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16820-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoresis was run with a 12% polyacrylamide gel for protein R2 and p53R2, 9% for p53, and 6% for R1. We loaded onto the gels two or three different aliquots of each protein to establish a range of proportionality for the signal of the antibodies. We used 10–20 μg for protein R1 and R2, 8–16 μg for p53, 2–4 μg for p53R2, and 0.5–1 μg for β-actin. We detected the subunits of human ribonucleotide reductase and β-actin (used as internal calibrator) with the antibodies used previously (13Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Hakansson P. Thelander L. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16820-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The antibody against human p53 was a mouse monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) used at 1/1200 dilution. All secondary antibodies were horseradish-peroxidase conjugated and were developed by using an ECL advanced kit (Amersham Biosciences). We quantitated the signals with Kodak 1D image analysis software. Isotope Experiments—The procedures for the isotope experiments, separation of cytosolic and mt dTTP pools, and determination of the specific radioactivity of dTTP were detailed earlier (6Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Before addition of [3H]TdR we substituted the medium with fresh medium with 10% (cycling cells) or 0.1% dialyzed FCS (quiescent cells) and left the cultures to equilibrate for 1–2 h. All manipulations took place in a 37 °C room to avoid thermal shocks. We incubated HOS TK1+ cells with [3H]TdR (20,000 cpm/pmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) 48 h from seeding (0.8 × 106 cells per 10-cm plate) and inducible Ost TK1– cells after incubation with 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 4 days, during which the cells were trypsinized and replated once. At the end of [3H]TdR incubations we moved the cultures to a cold room and separated cytosolic and mt dNTPs by differential centrifugation of cell homogenates as described before (6Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12159-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We extracted the dNTP pools with 60% methanol and dissolved the pellet of the combined nuclear and mt fraction in 0.3 m NaOH to measure the incorporation of radioactivity into macromolecular DNA. Total cellular dNTP pools were extracted with ice-cold 60% methanol for 1 h from the cells still attached to the plates (7Ferraro P. Pontarin G. Crocco L. Fabris S. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24472-24480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We determined the size of dNTP pools and the specific radioactivity of the dTTP pool in isotope experiments by a DNA-polymerase assay (6Pontarin G. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Reichard P. Bianchi V.

Biochem. 1989; 180: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Enzymatic Assays—We assayed TK2 activity in whole cell and mt extracts with 0.2 μm [3H]BVDU as the substrate and the total thymidine kinase activity in extracts of cycling TK1+ cells with 1 μm [3H]TdR (24Franzolin E. Rampazzo C. Perez-Perez M.J. Hernandez A.I. Balzarini J. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In extracts of quiescent fibroblasts we used [3H]TdR and a specific inhibitor of TK2 (24Franzolin E. Rampazzo C. Perez-Perez M.J. Hernandez A.I. Balzarini J. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) to ascertain the presence of TK1 activity. We determined TP activity as described by MartÀet al. (34Marti R. Spinazzola A. Tadesse S. Nishino I. Nishigaki Y. Hirano M. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with modifications. For each sample we prepared 4 tubes: 2 aliquots (6–12 μg) of protein extract in 0.02 ml of 0.1 m Tris-arsenate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm TdR and 2 parallel blank reactions in buffer without TdR. After 1 h at 37°Cwe stopped the reactions with 0.1 ml of 0.3 m NaOH. In the blanks 10 mm TdR was added only after the addition of NaOH. The A300 nm of all samples was measured to calculate the specific activity of TP as described previously (34Marti R. Spinazzola A. Tadesse S. Nishino I. Nishigaki Y. Hirano M. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We express TK2 activities as picomoles of product/min/mg of protein and TP activities as nanomoles/h/mg. We prepared protein extracts as described previously (24Franzolin E. Rampazzo C. Perez-Perez M.J. Hernandez A.I. Balzarini J. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by adding protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to the lysis buffer. We measured protein concentration by the colorimetric procedure of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. For the preparation of mitochondrial extracts we resuspended 1 × 108 cells in 12 ml of extraction buffer containing 0.21 m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mg/ml digitonin (Sigma), and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science. We homogenized the cells by passing them four times through a syringe needle (22 gauge × 30 mm). We sedimented first the nuclei by centrifuging the homogenate at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the mitochondria by centrifuging the supernatant at 15,000 × g for 20 min. After washing twice with 4 ml of the same buffer, we resuspended the mitochondrial pellet in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. We centrifuged the lysate at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to precipitate membrane debris and used the supernatant for the enzymatic assays. Preparation of Plasmids to Silence TK2 by RNA Interference—To study the role of TK2 in the maintenance of mt dTTP we developed an siRNA reagent to knock down enzyme expression in cultured human cells. We tested in transient transfections with HEK 293 cells the ability of several in vitro synthesized siRNAs to down-regulate TK2 mRNA. Two siRNAs targeting the 3′-untranslated region, named KF and KG, reduced the level of TK2 mRNA to 35 and 50% relative to mock transfected controls. We made plasmid constructs to express the two sequences as shRNAs in stable clones and compared their silencing effects in cells devoid of TK1 to simplify the detection of TK2 activity. We transfected cultures of clone Ost TK1– 1.25, which contains the tetracycline repressor, with plasmids pTER-KF, pTER-KG, or the empty vector used as control, isolated stable clones of each kind, and measured the level of TK2 mRNA by real-time PCR. Positive pTER-KF clones had 35% of the control mRNA level, and pTER-KG clones had 38%. In all RNAi clones TK2 activity in"

How this lineage is genetically determined remained largely obscure. Methods and Principal Findings Using the Siglecg-deficient mice with a knockin of green-fluorescent protein encoding sequence, we show here that, although the Siglecg gene is broadly expressed at high levels in all stages and/or lineages of B cells tested and at lower levels in other lineages, its deletion selectively expanded the B1a B cell lineages, including the frequency of the B1 cell progenitor in the bone marrow and the number of B1a cells in the peritoneal cavity, by postnatal expansion. The expansion of B1a B cells in the peritoneal correlated with enhanced activation of NFκB and was ablated by an IKK inhibitor. Conclusion and Significance Our data revealed a critical role for Siglec G-NFκB pathway in regulating B1a B cell lineage. These data lead to a novel model of B1a lineage development that explains a large array of genetic data in this field."

In the airways of patients with CF, mutations in the cftr gene lead to the production of poorly hydrated airway surface liquid interface, thick and sticky mucus, which in turn reduces mucociliary clearance and promotes bacterial colonization and secondary infections (5Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir. J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).

Absorption of the obligate cation Na+ across the apical membrane of the respective epithelium also contributes to the pathology (5Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 351-380Google Scholar). Some of the earliest electrophysiological studies of CF patient airways demonstrated that an amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport pathway contributed to the raised transepithelial potential difference across CF nasal epithelia (12Knowles M. Gatzy J. Boucher R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 305: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). This sensitivity to the diuretic amiloride suggested an involvement of the ENaC family of proteins. Recently, further experimental evidence supporting a role for ENaC in airway hydration has been obtained in mice overexpressing β-ENaC (13Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). These animals develop a “CF-like” airway disease, which was attributed to over-absorption of Na+. CFTR knock-out mice recapitulated the gastrointestinal abnormalities but did not show this airway pathology (13Mall M. Grubb B.R. Harkema J.R. O'Neal W.K. Boucher R.C. Nat.

These facts suggest that these two proteins are functionally interrelated. Previous studies have suggested that CFTR down-regulates ENaC function (14Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M.

Kirk K.L. Dawson D.C. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2003: 55-93Google Scholar). In CF, however, the reverse process happens: ENaC is freed from the constraint exerted by CFTR, which is either non-functional or absent in CF, and now causes increased absorption of Na+ across the epithelium, with Cl- following via paracellular pathways. The result is dehydration of the airway surface fluid seen in CF patients (5Boucher R.C. Eur. Respir. J. 2004; 23: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).

Gatzy J. Boucher R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 305: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). However, the existence of this interaction in vitro has been questioned (24Nagel G. J. Cyst.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the mechanism underlying this interaction is poorly defined. In the present study, we have addressed the issue of whether or not there is direct interaction between ENaC and CFTR using an independent biophysical approach; i.e. FRET imaging. FRET exploits the exquisite sensitivity of fluorescence measurements to detect the presence of molecular complexes with near angstrom resolution. Using a standard FRET pair, with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) as a donor and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) as an acceptor, we have found that co-transfection of ECFP-CFTR with EYFP-tagged ENaC subunits resulted in significant FRET efficiencies (E). In contrast, co-transfection of ENaC subunits with ECFP-CLCN1, an ion channel not found to functionally couple with ENaC, resulted in little to no FRET (E < 0.5%), an outcome comparable to negative controls (ECFP and EYFP co-transfected cells). Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments showed that αβγ-ENaC consistently co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR. These results place CFTR and ENaC proteins in very close proximity to each other, consistent with a direct interaction of these two proteins. This renders plausible a possibility that these two proteins interact directly in vivo to contribute to CF airway pathology. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (kind gift of Dr. K. Kirk, University of Alabama at Birmingham) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in polystyrene flasks at 37 °C with 5% CO2. One day before transfection, the cells were subcultured using trypsin (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) and ∼50,000 cells were seeded on 1:10 diluted poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Transient Transfection—Transient transfections of the cells with construct(s) of interest were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (27Meltzer R.H.

Briefly, 1 μl/200 ng of DNA of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was diluted with 100 μl of Opti-MEM® I (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Separately, 200 ng of each DNA construct was diluted with 100 μl of Opti-MEM® I (Invitrogen). After 5-min incubation, the diluted DNA constructs were combined with Lipofectamine 2000 and allowed to complex for 20 min. After incubation the transfection solution was added to the cells in Opti-MEM® I. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator followed by a change of the transfection solution to regular growth medium without antibiotics. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were gently rinsed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (prepared from 20% EM Grade solution, Electron Microscopy Services, Hatfield, PA). Cells then were rinsed three times with 1× PBS and mounted on glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific) using 0.2% n-propyl gallate (Sigma) in 9:1 glycerol/PBS (v/v). The same protocol was used to transfect the cells for co-immunoprecipitation experiments; the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 ratio was 1 μg/2.5 μl. Generation of the Fluorophore-tagged CFTR and ENaC cDNAs—We have restricted our study to the N-terminal tail of CFTR and C termini of αβγ-ENaC. Previous studies have shown that an interference with the C-terminal tail of CFTR might lead to its improper localization due to disruption of a PDZ binding motif (28Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H.

Similarly, manipulation of N termini of αβγ-ENaC affects its gating properties (18Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Karlson K.H. Stanton B.A. Ismailov I.I. Biophys.

The EGFP was exchanged with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein CFTR (ECFP-CFTR) following NheI/XhoI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA or Promega, Madison, WI) digestion (see Fig. 1C).

Positive control (ECFP-EYFP) was generated by fusion of ECFP to EYFP-N1 vector using XhoI and BamHI restriction sites through a 7-amino acid linker (SGLRSRA). All constructs were verified by direct sequencing prior to use. ENaC Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Abs) were generated against synthetic peptides in collaboration with Dr. Mark Knepper (National Institutes of Health). Antigenic peptides with the sequences, α-hENaC, LMKGNKREEQGLGPEPAAPQQPTC; β-hENaC, CNYDSLRLQPLDVIESDSEGDAI; and γ-hENaC, CNTLRLDSAFSSQLTDTQLTNEF, were synthesized by Lofstrand Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). The peptides correspond to human sequences, chosen to maximize immunogenicity, to minimize likely cross reactions with other eukaryotic proteins, and to avoid common post-translational modifications as described (32Knepper M.A. Masilamani S.

The peptides were conjugated to a carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits using a standard protocol (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA). Antisera from test bleeds, production bleeds, and final exsanguination were affinity-purified and tested on immunoblots from human kidney cortex and medulla (not shown).

CFTR—HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 μg of ECFP-CFTR construct. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Pierce) complemented with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Biochemical, Mannheim, Germany) at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) non-soluble material was discarded. 100 μg of total cell lysate was analyzed on a 6% protein gel (Invitrogen). The protein gel was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with 1:10,000 diluted polyclonal Ab against the second nucleotide binding domain of CFTR (University of Alabama at Birmingham Cystic Fibrosis Research Center) and probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Denmark A/S) using chemiluminescence. ENaC—HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg of ENaC construct. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) non-soluble material was discarded. 2 μg of total cell lysate was analyzed on 4–20% gradient NuPage gel (Invitrogen); a Bio-Rad Broad range prestained marker was used as the molecular weight standard. The protein gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with 1:10,000 dilution of α-ENaC-specific Ab (lot #7038-4, 0.9 μg/ml stock solution), 1:10,000 dilution of β-ENaC-specific Ab (lot #7040-4, 0.84 μg/ml stock solution), and 1:10,000 dilution of γ-ENaC-specific Ab (lot #7042-4, 2.37 μg/ml stock solution). These polyclonal anti-ENaC-specific Abs were applied in 5% dry milk in PBS/Tween (0.1%), overnight. After incubating the blot with ENaC Abs, it was incubated with 1:10,000 diluted anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Dako) and developed using West Pico (Pierce). CFTR and ENaC Co-immunoprecipitation—CFTR and ENaC co-immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (35Cormet-Boyaka E. Di A. Chang S.Y. Naren A.P. Tousson A. Nelson D.J. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12477-12482Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with CFTR and appropriate combinations of ENaC subunits. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS complemented with Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. After centrifugation (15,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) non-soluble material was discarded, and the supernatant was incubated with 1 μg of C-terminal CFTR monoclonal Ab clone 24-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) cross-linked to A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h. After incubating the lysates with cross-linked Ab, the beads were pelleted and washed three to five times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100. Precipitated CFTR and bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the samples were processed for Western blotting using Abs raised against ENaC and CFTR. FRET Imaging—The acceptor photobleaching approach was performed as previously described (27Meltzer R.H. Kapoor N. Qadri Y.J. Anderson S.J. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Microsc. 2003; 209: 56-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, images were acquired using the Leica Confocal Scanning System (Exton, PA) TCS SP2 outfitted with a Leica DMRXE upright microscope, an argon laser, and 100 × 1.4 numerical aperture Plan Apochromatic oil immersion objective. ECFP and EYFP fluorescence were excited with 458 and 514 nm laser light, respectively. Dual excitation was achieved by a dual dichroic (DD458/514) mirror in the excitation path. The emissions for ECFP and EYFP were collected using 465–505 and 525–600 nm bandpass windows, respectively. Fixed samples were imaged within 3 days. We noticed an increase in background fluorescence if fixed samples were processed after a long period (>7–10 days) of storage. The regions of interest in cells expressing both fluorophores were photobleached using 514 nm laser light to 30% of original intensity. ECFP and EYFP images were taken both before and after acceptor photobleaching. FRET efficiency (E) was calculated using Leica software: E = Dpost - Dpre/Dpost, where Dpre and Dpost are ECFP emission before and after regional photobleaching. FLIM—The images were taken with the LIFA system (Lambert Instruments, The Netherlands), a frequency domain FLIM system, attached to a Nikon TE2000 wide field fluorescence microscope with 100 × 1.49 numerical aperture objective. A 443 nm modulated LED was used as a light source, and 12 phase-step images were taken at the frequency of 40 MHz with the modulated ICCD (intensified charge-coupled device) camera. By using the filter cyan GFP only the donor emission was measured. In the resulting images, the intensity is shown in grayscale analog-to-digital units, and the lifetime from phase is in pseudocolors (nanoseconds). Expression, Fluorescence Imaging, and Functional Analysis of the Fluorophore-tagged Constructs—Western blot detection of tagged CFTR and ENaC constructs was performed to test whether the fusion of the 27-kDa ECFP or EYFP tags affected protein expression. The blot in Fig. 1C demonstrates the bands corresponding to the expected molecular mass of untagged CFTR (lane 1) and the N-terminally tagged construct with a 27-kDa fluorescence tag, ECFP (lane 2, ECFP-CFTR). Similarly, the bands corresponding to the molecular mass of ENaCs with 27-kDa fluorescence tags were observed in cells expressing tagged ENaC subunits (Fig. 1D). We next tested whether fusion of the ECFP or EYFP tags altered the proper plasma membrane targeting of CFTR and ENaC constructs. We found that the expression of CFTR construct predominantly delineated the plasma membrane. This staining suggests that the addition of fluorescence tags does not interfere with the trafficking of CFTR (data not shown). The functional expression of fluorophore-tagged CFTR constructs revealed no alteration in its function as a Cl- channel (data not shown) in agreement with previously published findings (28Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A predominant endoplasmic reticulum staining was observed for ENaC by immunofluorescence (data not shown) and is characteristic of the poor trafficking of these proteins. However, amiloride-sensitive currents characteristic of functional ENaC channels were recorded from cells transiently transfected with tagged ENaC subunits (data not shown and Refs. 27Meltzer R.H.

These data suggest that a population of ENaC proteins reaches the plasma membrane of transfected cells. Cotransfection of CFTR and ENaC constructs showed colocalization of the two proteins suggesting that they can traffic to the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S1). ENaC Subunits Interact with CFTR—In a recent report (18Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Karlson K.H. Stanton B.A. Ismailov I.I. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1881-1894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) we have presented a systematic study of the kinetic properties of ENaCs formed by different combinations of subunits. We also correlated our kinetic data with the effects of CFTR on ENaC. We found that CFTR inhibits ENaCs at a single channel level, suggestive of a direct physical interaction. To further validate these findings, we have employed a biochemical approach, Co-IP, to assess a physical interaction between CFTR and ENaC. When CFTR and α-, β-, and γ-ENaC were co-expressed, each ENaC subunit was co-immunoprecipitated with CFTR using a C-terminal CFTR Ab, suggesting that CFTR and ENaC channels are in a complex (Fig. 2). No co-IP signal was detected when ENaC subunits or CFTR were expressed alone indicating that the co-IP signals are specific and demonstrate that ENaC subunits do not bind nonspecifically to the beads. The expression of the ENaC subunits was confirmed by Western blot and could not be detected in untransfected cells. The bottom panels of Fig. 2 show the same blot reprobed with anti-CFTR Ab to confirm the presence of CFTR in the IP. Taken together, these results indicate that CFTR and ENaC do interact in HEK293T cells. As an additional control, we assayed for the possibility that the Co-IP signals observed resulted from random aggregation of CFTR and ENaC subunits due to overexpression. Thus, one culture of cells was transfected with CFTR while a second culture was transfected with β-ENaC. After mixing these two lysates, co-IP experiments were performed as described above. No β-ENaC signal was detected suggesting that the interaction between CFTR and β-ENaC do not occur post-lysis (data not shown). This finding also reduces the possibility that this interaction is due to overexpression and random interactions of the proteins. Next, we substituted the CFTR with ECFP-CLCN1, a Cl- channel that is not thought to interact with ENaC. As can be seen from Fig. 2D, we were unable to Co-IP β-ENaC with ECFP-CLCN1. In this approach we used anti-GFP monoclonal Ab JL-8 (BD Living Colors) that recognizes CFP protein to IP CLCN1, and then probed with the β-ENaC Ab. The expression of CLCN1 in the cells was confirmed using GFP Ab (Fig. 2D). The cells expressing αβγ-ENaC and/or ECFP-CLCN1 were immunoprecipitated with an Ab against GFP. Although this Ab detected ECFP-CLCN1 in both crude lysates and IP of ECFP-CLCN1-expressing cells, an Ab against β-ENaC failed to detect a band in IP of co-expressing cells (top panel and right hand lanes of the bottom panel). However, this Ab did detect β-ENaC in the crude lysates from cells expressing either αβγ-ENaC alone or those co-expressing ECFP-CLCN1. These data suggest that β-ENaC does not interact with the chloride channel CLCN1. All together, these data suggest that CFTR and ENaC can interact in HEK293T cells and that this interaction is specific. FRET Measurements by Acceptor Photobleaching—Because ENaC subunits Co-IP with CFTR (Fig. 2), their possible interaction was probed by FRET imaging. FRET occurs when donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins are sufficiently close (≤10 nm) that radiationless (i.e. not mediated by photons) transfer of energy from donor to acceptor (39Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 40Kenworthy A.K. Methods. 2001; 24: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 41Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) can be observed after excitation of the donor (Fig. 1A). Both the rate and the efficiency of energy transfer are directly related to the distance between the donor and acceptor. If the fluorophores are more than 10 nm apart, no FRET will be detected (Fig. 1B). In acceptor photobleaching FRET, the acceptor is selectively photobleached (36Karpova T.S. Baumann C.T. He L. Wu X"
https://openalex.org/W1997053084,"The discovery of genetic code alterations and expansions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes abolished the hypothesis of a frozen and universal genetic code and exposed unanticipated flexibility in codon and amino acid assignments. It is now clear that codon identity alterations involve sense and non-sense codons and can occur in organisms with complex genomes and proteomes. However, the biological functions, the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the diversity of genetic code alterations remain largely unknown. In various species of the genus Candida, the leucine CUG codon is decoded as serine by a unique serine tRNA that contains a leucine 5'-CAG-3'anticodon (tRNA(CAG)(Ser)). We are using this codon identity redefinition as a model system to elucidate the evolution of genetic code alterations.We have reconstructed the early stages of the Candida genetic code alteration by engineering tRNAs that partially reverted the identity of serine CUG codons back to their standard leucine meaning. Such genetic code manipulation had profound cellular consequences as it exposed important morphological variation, altered gene expression, re-arranged the karyotype, increased cell-cell adhesion and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes.Our study provides the first experimental evidence for an important role of genetic code alterations as generators of phenotypic diversity of high selective potential and supports the hypothesis that they speed up evolution of new phenotypes."

Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Growth factors activate the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) 2The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent protein kinase; ca-STAT5A, constitutively active STAT5A; HDFs, human diploid fibroblasts; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. -cyclin complexes that phosphorylate Rb, inhibiting its binding to E2F factors (1Cobrinik D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2796-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function mutations in genes that stimulate cell cycle progression can potentially disable the Rb barrier, leading to tumorigenesis. Hence, for efficient tumor suppression, normal cells must avoid Rb inactivation by oncogenes. Studies on the senescent cell cycle arrest in response to oncogenic ras have provided a general model of Rb activation by oncogenes in normal cells. Aberrant ras activity induces the expression of CDK inhibitors of the INK4 family such as p15INK4b (3Malumbres M. Perez De Castro I. Hernandez M.I. Jimenez M. Corral T. Pellicer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2915-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and p16INK4a (4Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar). As a consequence, Rb accumulates in its active hypophosphorylated form during Ras-induced senescence. This pathway is critical for Ras-induced senescence because disabling either p16INK4a or the Rb family inhibits the process (4Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar, 5Huot T.J. Rowe J. Harland M. Drayton S. Brookes S. Gooptu C. Purkis P. Fried M. Bataille V. Hara E. Newton-Bishop J. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8135-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the INK4 proteins are universal mediators of Rb activation in response to oncogenic signaling or whether other molecular mechanisms can engage Rb to regulate senescence. To answer this question, we have developed a senescence model in normal human fibroblasts by expressing ca-STAT5A, a constitutively active allele of STAT5A (6Mallette F.A. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Ferbeyre G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This allele was shown to be constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine residues, localized to the nucleus, and transcriptionally active (7Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A.L. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Hence, ca-STAT5A provides a persistent and unregulated STAT5A signal similar to that observed in some human tumors (8Li H. Ahonen T.J. Alanen K. Xie J. LeBaron M.J. Pretlow T.G. Ealley E.L. Zhang Y. Nurmi M. Singh B. Martikainen P.M. Nevalainen M.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4774-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Xi S. Zhang Q. Dyer K.F. Lerner E.C. Smithgall T.E. Gooding W.E. Kamens J. Grandis J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31574-31583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We show here that ca-STAT5A engages the Rb pathway by down-regulating Myc instead of the p16INK4a-mediated mechanism described in RasV12-induced senescence. As a consequence, cells expressing ca-STAT5 have a decrease in the expression of Myc targets such as CDK4 and an increase in the CDK inhibitor p15INK4b. In agreement, ca-STAT5A-induced senescence is blocked when CDK4 or Myc is overexpressed in combination with dominant-negative p53 or the E6 protein of human papillomavirus. We conclude that the pathways regulating Rb by oncogenic signals are oncogene-specific and discuss the relevance of this concept for human cancers. Cells and Retroviruses—Normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), BJ cells (obtained from Dr. S. W. Lowe), and IMR90 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). Primary human mammary epithelial cells were cultured in MEGM® (Clonetics) containing 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 ng/ml amphotericin B, and 52 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Retroviral vectors are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, cell proliferation analysis (growth curves and bromodeoxyuridine and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays), cell cycle analysis, and senescence assays were done as described (6Mallette F.A. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Ferbeyre G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E. Baptiste N. Prives C. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2015-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Expression Analysis—To prepare total cellular protein, cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 5 min. For Western blotting, 20 μg of total cellular protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). The primary antibodies used are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Signals were revealed after incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) or Lumi-LightPLUS (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence microscopy was done as described previously (11Mallette F.A. Goumard S. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Moiseeva O. Ferbeyre G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is also detailed under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” To visualize Myc in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, the protocol was modified by extracting the cells with cytoskeletal buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, and 3 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were then fixed and treated for immunofluorescence as described (11Mallette F.A. Goumard S. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Moiseeva O. Ferbeyre G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assays—H1299 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 2 μg of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the CDK4 (provided by C. V. Dang, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore), p21, or MDM2 promoter; 0.5 μg of Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the β-globin promoter; 250 ng of Myc- or p53-expressing plasmid; and increasing amounts (0, 0.1, or 1 μg) of pBabeSTAT5A1*6 (ca-STAT5A). The total quantity of plasmid was kept constant by adding the empty vector pBabe. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and processed for Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA Analysis—For real-time reverse transcription-PCR or semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR, 2–5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with a RevertAid™ H minus first strand synthesis kit (Fermentas Life Sciences) using oligo(dT) primers, and the resulting first strand cDNA was used as a template for PCR. Specific primers are described under supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” ca-STAT5A Induces Senescence in Human Cells—We reported that the DNA damage response (DDR) is required to induce p53 during STAT5-induced senescence (6Mallette F.A. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Ferbeyre G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of activation of the Rb pathway in response to ca-STAT5A remained unknown. To investigate how STAT5A engages the Rb pathway, we used a retrovirus that directs the expression of ca-STAT5A in HDFs. As a control, we infected cells with a virus expressing RasV12, which is known to activate Rb by inducing p16INK4a. RasV12- or ca-STAT5A-expressing HDFs proliferated normally during the first 4 days after retroviral infection, indicating that the immediate effect of the introduction of these oncogenes does not inhibit cell growth. However, both RasV12- and ca-STAT5A-expressing cells dramatically decreased their DNA synthesis 8 days after retroviral infection (6 days post-selection) (Fig. 1A) and remained in a non-dividing state for at least 20 days. Cells expressing ca-STAT5A arrested their proliferation with a prominent G1 DNA content (Fig. 1B) and displayed the morphology of flat cells that stained positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1A). Notably, the levels of phospho-STAT5A displayed by ca-STAT5A-infected fibroblasts were comparable with those found in the leukemia cell line K562 (Fig. 1C). Next, we used a wild-type allele of STAT5A to investigate if the ability to induce senescence requires tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5. We found that STAT5A-induced senescence was observed only with the allele STAT5A1*6 and not with wild-type STAT5A (Fig. 1D). Also, ca-STAT5B (known as STAT5B1*6), which has the same activating mutations as STAT5A1*6 but is not constitutively phosphorylated to the same extent (Fig. 1C), was not able to induce senescence in a significant proportion of the cells (data not shown). Hence, as reported for oncogenic ras (12Sarkisian C.J. Keister B.A. Stairs D.B. Boxer R.B. Moody S.E. Chodosh L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), the senescence phenotype depends on the strength of signaling. The senescence response to STAT5A was also documented in BJ cells, another strain of normal human fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. 1B), and in primary mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 1E). Hence, STAT5A-induced senescence is not restricted to IMR90 fibroblasts and occurs in mammary epithelial cells, a cell type in which STAT5 plays a role in both normal physiology (13Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 14Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar, 15Barash I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and breast cancer (15Barash I. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Ren S. Cai H.R. Li M. Furth P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4335-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Cotarla I. Ren S. Zhang Y. Gehan E. Singh B. Furth P.A. Int. J Cancer. 2004; 108: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We concluded that ca-STAT5A induced senescence in normal cells when activated to the same extent as found in human cancers, providing a new model to investigate the mechanisms of Rb activation during oncogene-induced senescence. ca-STAT5A Induces the Down-regulation of CDK4 and the Activation of the Rb Pathway in Human Cells—The activation of the Rb pathway in response to oncogenes in normal cells is known to involve induction of CDK inhibitors such as p21, p16INK4a, and p15INK4b (18Lowe S.W. Cepero E. Evan G. Nature. 2004; 432: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). To better characterize the mechanism of Rb activation during ca-STAT5A-induced senescence, we measured the levels of the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of the Rb pathway (Fig. 2A). To begin with, senescence induced by ca-STAT5A was characterized by Rb hypophosphorylation, down-regulation of the E2F-dependent genes cyclin A and MCM6, and up-regulation of ezrin. The latter was shown to be induced by Rb, mediating the characteristic flat morphology of senescent cells (19Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1163-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intriguingly and in contrast to Ras-induced senes cence, ca-STAT5A did not induce p16INK4a or p21 but led to a moderate down-regulation of CDK4. CDK4 down-regulation was also observed at the mRNA level (Fig. 2B). In consequence, oncogenic STAT5A engages the Rb pathway by a mechanism different from the one reported during Ras-induced senescence. Next, we investigated whether the observed reduction in CDK4 levels is important for STAT5-induced senescence. To do the experiment, we first prepared IMR90 cells expressing human papillomavirus 16 E6 to inactivate the p53 pathway. This was necessary because in IMR90 fibroblasts it is not possible to bypass Ras- or STAT5-induced senescence by isolated inactivation of the p53 or Rb pathway (supplemental Fig. 2). As expected, expression of E6 (which blocks the p53 pathway) or CDK4 (which blocks the Rb pathway) did not rescue ca-STAT5A-induced senescence. However, E6 and CDK4 together efficiently blocked senescence (Fig. 2C). Mechanism of CDK4 Down-regulation during STAT5-induced Senescence—The decrease in CDK4 protein and mRNA levels during STAT5-induced senescence suggests either a decrease in CDK4 gene expression or an increase in mRNA turnover. We first investigated the effects of STAT5A on the CDK4 promoter and its main known regulator, c-Myc (20Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V. Sedivy J.M. Eick D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The CDK4 promoter contains Myc-binding sites, and as reported previously (20Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M. Li Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V. Sedivy J.M. Eick D. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), it is stimulated by Myc in transient transfection assays (data not shown). Transfection of ca-STAT5A together with Myc and the CDK4 promoter-reporter blocked Myc activity in H1299 human lung tumor cells (Fig. 3A). However, ca-STAST5A did not affect the ability of p53 to stimulate the p21 and MDM2 promoters (Fig. 3A). Hence, ca-STAT5A can specifically inhibit Myc activity. Because there are no known STAT5A-binding sites in the CDK4 promoter, these results suggest that ca-STAT5A can block general Myc activity. To confirm this hypothesis, we measured other Myc target genes during STAT5-induced senescence. We found a down-regulation of classic Myc targets such as Cdc7 and Cdc25c (Fig. 3B) (21Lawlor E.R. Soucek L. Brown-Swigart L. Shchors K. Bialucha C.U. Evan G.I. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4591-4601Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the decrease was similar to the decrease of the E2F target thymidine kinase-1. We also observed an increase in the Myc-repressed gene p15INK4b (22Staller P. Peukert K. Kiermaier A. Seoane J. Lukas J. Karsunky H. Moroy T. Bartek J. Massague J. Hanel F. Eilers M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This CDK inhibitor may further activate Rb by inhibiting CDK6 and the remaining levels of CDK4 in cells expressing ca-STAT5A. Taken together, our data indicate that a down-regulation of Myc can engage the Rb pathway via two mechanisms: down-regulation of CDK4 and release of p15INK4b from repression. Mechanism of Myc Down-regulation during STAT5A-induced Senescence—Next, we investigated Myc levels and activity in the context of ca-STAT5A-induced senescence. STAT5-induced senescence caused a dramatic reduction of Myc protein levels (Fig. 4A). Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 rescued Myc levels in the nucleus of every cell as assessed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4B). This result suggested that proteasome-dependent degradation was part of the mechanism of Myc down-regulation. Next, we looked for STAT5 target genes that could influence Myc degradation by the proteasome. We first focused on PML, which is known to be regulated by STAT transcription factors and to contain STAT5-binding sites in its promoter (23Lavau C. Marchio A. Fagioli M. Jansen J. Falini B. Lebon P. Grosveld F. Pandolfi P.P. Pelicci P.G. Dejean A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 871-876PubMed Google Scholar). Also, PML interacts with Myc and induces its degradation (24Smith K.P. Byron M. O'Connell B.C. Tam R. Schorl C. Guney I. Hall L.L. Agrawal P. Sedivy J.M. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1282-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Cairo S. De Falco F. Pizzo M. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Meroni G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Buschbeck M. Uribesalgo I. Ledl A. Gutierrez A. Minucci S. Muller S. Di Croce L. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3415-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that ca-STAT5A induced the formation of PML bodies when expressed in normal human fibroblasts (Fig. 4C). Also, using confocal microscopy, we revealed that a fraction of these PML bodies co-localized with Myc during STAT5-induced senescence (Fig. 4D). Although the extent of co-localization was moderate, it was similar to previous reports of Myc localization to PML bodies (24Smith K.P. Byron M. O'Connell B.C. Tam R. Schorl C. Guney I. Hall L.L. Agrawal P. Sedivy J.M. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1282-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Cairo S. De Falco F. Pizzo M. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Meroni G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Together, the data are consistent with a model of dynamic localization of Myc to PML bodies, where Myc may undergo degradation and/or modifications that ultimately target it to the proteasome. These results contrast with previous data showing that STAT5A is required to induce Myc in lymphoid cells treated with interleukin-2 (27Lord J.D. McIntosh B.C. Greenberg P.D. Nelson B.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2533-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We believe that the down-regulation of Myc we observed in STAT5A-induced senescence is not an immediate and direct consequence of normal STAT5 signaling but the result of a cellular response to sustained and unregulated STAT5 signaling. Myc Cooperates with E6 to Bypass STAT5-induced Senescence—To investigate whether the down-regulation of Myc by ca-STAT5A is causal to the induction of senescence via the Rb pathway, we prepared HDFs in which the p53 pathway was inactivated using E6. In this way, we can study the role of the Myc/CDK4/Rb pathway in isolation. Introduction of ca-STAT5A in E6-expressing HDFs induced senescence as described above (Fig. 2C). However, coexpression of ca-STAT5A with Myc and E6 dramatically reduced the numbers of senescent cells (Fig. 5A). An allele of Myc with increased stability due to the mutation T58A (28Sears R. Nuckolls F. Haura E. Taya Y. Tamai K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2501-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) was even more potent in blocking STAT5A-induced senescence. Both Myc and Myc(T58A) were also able to rescue CDK4 expression in STAT5A-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Of note, although the degradation mechanism triggered by ca-STAT5A also affected the stability of the Myc alleles expressed from a retroviral vector, the final levels of Myc were much higher than in control cells (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that exogenous Myc is able to overcome the Myc inhibitory effects of cells expressing ca-STAT5A. We report here a novel mechanism of activation of the Rb pathway in response to oncogenic signals. An allele of STAT5A that mimics the constitutive activation of STAT5 seen in many human tumors activates the Rb pathway by suppressing Myc expression and activity. During STAT5A-induced senescence, at least two direct Myc targets were identified as mediators of Rb activation in response to low Myc activity. First, the levels of the CDK4 protein kinase were moderately but consistently low. Second, the levels of the Myc-repressed gene p15INK4b, a CDK inhibitor, were high. These mechanisms can cooperate to keep Rb hypophosphorylated, preventing E2F activity, which is required for cell cycle progression. This reduced Myc activity is important for STAT5A senescence because the process was rescued by enforced expression of Myc or CDK4 in cells in which p53 was inactivated by E6. In agreement with our model, it has been reported that enforcing inhibition of myc expression can lead to cellular senescence in both normal and tumor cells (29Guney I. Wu S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3645-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Wu C.H. van Riggelen J. Yetil A. Fan A.C. Bachireddy P. Felsher D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Significantly, our work establishes an endogenous pathway of myc repression that counteracts the oncogenic stress provided by constitutive activation of STAT5A. Our model to explain STAT5A-induced senescence presents two tumor suppressor pathways that can act independently to mediate the process. ca-STAT5A can induce senescence in cells in which either the Rb or p53 pathway is intact but not in cells in which both pathways are disabled (Fig. 6). These independent abilities of the Rb and p53 pathways to regulate senescence ensure robustness in tumor suppression pathways, preventing cell transformation when p53 or Rb is accidentally inactivated. It is not clear yet if the Rb and p53 pathways are connected to oncogenes through entirely different mechanisms. Recent results have established that p53 is activated in response to a variety of oncogenes via the DNA damage response (6Mallette F.A. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Ferbeyre G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 31Bartkova J. Rezaei N. Liontos M. Karakaidos P. Kletsas D. Issaeva N. Vassiliou L.V. Kolettas E. Niforou K. Zoumpourlis V.C.

Maestro R. Pelicci P.G. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Nature. 2006; 444: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). During STAT5A-induced senescence, ablation of ATM expression using RNA interference does not prevent Rb-dependent senescence (6Mallette F.A. Gaumont-Leclerc M.-F. Ferbeyre G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ATM branch of DNA damage signaling does not connect oncogenes to the Rb pathway. However, STAT5-induced DNA damage could still signal to the Rb pathway via ATM-independent mechanisms that could eventually end in regulating Myc levels (Fig. 6). It is significant that in normal human fibroblasts, the expression of Myc acts genetically like that of E7 and CDK4, which are negative regulators of the Rb pathway. Consistent with this notion, enforced expression of Myc in human primary prostate epithelial cells inactivates the Rb pathway, leading to cellular immortalization (33Gil J. Kerai P. Lleonart M. Bernard D. Cigudosa J.C. Peters G. Carnero A. Beach D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Also, Myc inactivation in diverse tumor types induces tumor regression via cellular senescence. However, inactivation of the Rb pathway prevents this tumor regression (30Wu C.H. van Riggelen J. Yetil A. Fan A.C. Bachireddy P. Felsher D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Myc acts directly on Rb to regulate cell proliferation (34Rustgi A.K. Dyson N. Bernards R. Nature. 1991; 352: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, it is now well established that the Rb barrier to cell cycle progression is controlled by the concerted action of the CDKs, which phosphorylate Rb and release E2F transcription factors. Therefore, the effects of Myc to inhibit Rb during senescence are better explained by its ability to induce CDK4 and/or to repress the CDK inhibitor p15INK4b. The inhibition of senescence by CDK4 does not mean that CDK4 is the only Myc target required to prevent activation of the Rb pathway in response to ca-STAT5A. In fact, a genetic screen for genes able to rescue the growth defect of myc null rat fibroblasts identified only c-myc and N-myc (35Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Koh E. Daley G.Q. Bernards R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3330-3334Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This experiment suggests that there are no Myc targets that can substitute for Myc functions. To explain this apparent discrepancy, we propose that expression of CDK4 could initiate a positive feedback loop leading to sustained activation of endogenous Myc, via E2F1 (Fig. 6), which is a positive regulator of the myc gene (36Hiebert S.W. Lipp M. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3594-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this way, CDK4 can rescue the Myc defect in the context of STAT5-induced senescence. Our data also imply that factors regulating Myc stability in response to oncogenes play important tumor suppressor roles. One of those factors is the PML protein, which has been shown to regulate Myc degradation (25Cairo S. De Falco F. Pizzo M. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Meroni G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Buschbeck M. Uribesalgo I. Ledl A. Gutierrez A. Minucci S. Muller S. Di Croce L.

The evidence for a role of PML in Myc degradation remains correlative and will require further studies. PML is also induced by oncogenic ras via p53 (10Ferbeyre G. de Stanchina E. Querido E.

It is known that Ras can induce Myc stability (39Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), explaining why we did not observe Myc and CDK4 down-regulation during Ras-induced senescence. Alternatively, other STAT5-regulated genes play a critical role in Myc degradation. The enforced expression of Myc was sufficient to overcome the mechanisms of Myc down-regulation triggered by ca-STAT5A. Exogenous Myc was not completely degraded in cells expressing ca-STAT5A. This result suggests that the Myc degradation pathway can be saturated or inhibited by high levels of Myc, explaining why the amplification of the c-myc gene is a powerful oncogenic event (40Schwab M. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1990; 2: 35-51PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Myc is regulated at multiple levels, and it is possible that ca-STAT5A may engage other mechanisms that limit Myc activity, translation, or RNA levels (41Bentley D.L. Groudine M.

We anticipate that these tumors must have genetic or epigenetic changes inactivating the signaling pathways from STAT5A to senescence, including overexpression of Myc and loss of p53 target genes associated with senescence. Evidence for such genetic interactions can be found in the erythroleukemia cell line K562, which we showed has levels of endogenous phospho-STAT5 similar to those obtained with ca-STAT5A. This cell line has a mutated p53 gene (54Law J.C. Ritke M.K. Yalowich J.C. Leder G.H. Ferrell R.E. Leuk.

Intriguingly, T cells from elderly humans have a higher basal level of phospho-STAT5 compared with those from young controls. In addition, in old but not young subjects, phospho-STAT5 is increased by stimulation with interleukin-6, a cytokine that increases with aging (56Fulop T. Larbi A. Douziech N. Levesque I. Varin A.

https://openalex.org/W2169980386,"Phenylpropenes, a large group of plant volatile compounds that serve in multiple roles in defense and pollinator attraction, contain a propenyl side chain. Eugenol synthase (EGS) catalyzes the reductive displacement of acetate from the propenyl side chain of the substrate coniferyl acetate to produce the allyl-phenylpropene eugenol. We report here the structure determination of EGS from basil (Ocimum basilicum) by protein x-ray crystallography. EGS is structurally related to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs), and in particular, enzymes in the isoflavone-reductase-like subfamily. The structure of a ternary complex of EGS bound to the cofactor NADP(H) and a mixed competitive inhibitor EMDF ((7S,8S)-ethyl (7,8-methylene)-dihydroferulate) provides a detailed view of the binding interactions within the EGS active site and a starting point for mutagenic examination of the unusual reductive mechanism of EGS. The key interactions between EMDF and the EGS-holoenzyme include stacking of the phenyl ring of EMDF against the cofactor's nicotinamide ring and a water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interaction between the EMDF 4-hydroxy group and the side-chain amino moiety of a conserved lysine residue, Lys132. The C4 carbon of nicotinamide resides immediately adjacent to the site of hydride addition, the C7 carbon of cinnamyl acetate substrates. The inhibitor-bound EGS structure suggests a two-step reaction mechanism involving the formation of a quinone-methide prior to reduction. The formation of this intermediate is promoted by a hydrogen-bonding network that favors deprotonation of the substrate's 4-hydroxyl group and disfavors binding of the acetate moiety, akin to a push-pull catalytic mechanism. Notably, the catalytic involvement in EGS of the conserved Lys132 in preparing the phenolic substrate for quinone methide formation through the proton-relay network appears to be an adaptation of the analogous role in hydrogen bonding played by the equivalent lysine residue in other enzymes of the SDR family."
https://openalex.org/W2087332711,"Studies of morphological integration provide valuable information on the correlated evolution of traits and its relationship to long-term patterns of morphological evolution. Thus far, studies of morphological integration in mammals have focused on placentals and have demonstrated that similarity in integration is broadly correlated with phylogenetic distance and dietary similarity. Detailed studies have also demonstrated a significant correlation between developmental relationships among structures and adult morphological integration. However, these studies have not yet been applied to marsupial taxa, which differ greatly from placentals in reproductive strategy and cranial development and could provide the diversity necessary to assess the relationships among phylogeny, ecology, development, and cranial integration. This study presents analyses of morphological integration in 20 species of australodelphian marsupials, and shows that phylogeny is significantly correlated with similarity of morphological integration in most clades. Size-related correlations have a significant affect on results, particularly in Peramelia, which shows a striking decrease in similarity of integration among species when size is removed. Diet is not significantly correlated with similarity of integration in any marsupial clade. These results show that marsupials differ markedly from placental mammals in the relationships of cranial integration, phylogeny, and diet, which may be related to the accelerated development of the masticatory apparatus in marsupials."
https://openalex.org/W2024339549,"Amongst the numerous problems associated with the use of impact factors as a measure of quality are the systematic differences in impact factors that exist among scientific fields. While in theory this can be circumvented by limiting comparisons to journals within the same field, for a diverse and multidisciplinary field like evolutionary biology, in which the majority of papers are published in journals that publish both evolutionary and non-evolutionary papers, this is impossible. However, a journal's overall impact factor may well be a poor predictor for the impact of its evolutionary papers. The extremely high impact factors of some multidisciplinary journals, for example, are by many believed to be driven mostly by publications from other fields. Despite plenty of speculation, however, we know as yet very little about the true impact of evolutionary papers in journals not specifically classified as evolutionary. Here I present, for a wide range of journals, an analysis of the number of evolutionary papers they publish and their average impact. I show that there are large differences in impact among evolutionary and non-evolutionary papers within journals; while the impact of evolutionary papers published in multidisciplinary journals is substantially overestimated by their overall impact factor, the impact of evolutionary papers in many of the more specialized, non-evolutionary journals is significantly underestimated. This suggests that, for evolutionary biologists, publishing in high-impact multidisciplinary journals should not receive as much weight as it does now, while evolutionary papers in more narrowly defined journals are currently undervalued. Importantly, however, their ranking remains largely unaffected. While journal impact factors may thus indeed provide a meaningful qualitative measure of impact, a fair quantitative comparison requires a more sophisticated journal classification system, together with multiple field-specific impact statistics per journal."

Kinetic analysis of NIS mutants of the corresponding phosphorylated amino acid residue indicated that the velocity of iodide transport of NIS is modulated by the phosphorylation status of Ser-43 and Ser-581.

The current topology of NIS proposes that it contains 13 putative transmembrane segments with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxyl terminus. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that NIS cotransports two Na+ ions along with one I– ion into cells (1Eskandari S. Loo D.D. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol.

The iodide-concentrating activity of NIS serves as the basis for the clinical use of radioiodide in the detection and targeted destruction of differentiated thyroid carcinomas and their metastases. However, NIS expression and function are generally low or absent in patients with advanced thyroid cancer, consequently rendering radioiodide therapy ineffective. Therefore, investigations of the regulatory mechanisms of NIS expression and functional activity are of clinical significance.

It has been shown in cultured thyroid cells that deprivation of thyroid-stimulating hormone resulted in reduction of NIS protein half-life from 5 to 3 days and redistribution of NIS protein from the cell surface to intracellular compartments (2Riedel C. Levy O. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21458-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that the velocity of iodide transport was decreased by MEK inhibition, which accounted for the discordance between cell surface NIS levels and NIS-mediated radioiodide uptake (RAIU) activity in PD98059-treated cells (3Vadysirisack D.D. Venkateswaran A. Zhang Z. Jhiang S.M. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2007; 2: 421-432Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, some thyroid tumors had NIS protein detected exclusively at intracellular compartments, preventing these tumors from benefiting from NIS-mediated radioiodide imaging/therapy because of lack of cell surface NIS (4Castro M.R.

Taken together, these studies indicate that NIS protein levels, cell surface localization, and functional activity can be modulated at the post-translational level. However, the underlying mechanisms of these modulations are currently unknown. Because it has been reported that NIS is a phosphoprotein (2Riedel C. Levy O. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21458-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that NIS expression, subcellular trafficking, and/or activity may be modulated by phosphorylation status. In this study, we report the identification of five in vivo phosphorylated amino acid residues in NIS by mass spectrometry analysis. We examined the roles of these phosphorylated amino acid residues in total and cell surface NIS protein levels as well as functional activity by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that phosphorylated residues Ser-43 and Ser-581 modulate the velocity of iodide transport of NIS, that phosphorylated residue Thr-577 may be important for NIS protein stability, and that NIS cell surface trafficking is not affected by the phosphorylation status of these five amino acid residues. Cell Culture and Reagents—HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Transfection of HEK293 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation of FLAGrNIS—HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding rat NIS tagged with a FLAG epitope at its extracellular N terminus (FLAGrNIS) in pcDNA3 vector (6Zhang Z. Liu Y.Y. Jhiang S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 90: 6131-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, and 5 mm sodium orthovandate. Whole cell extract (5 mg) was precleared with mouse IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was then incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times, and proteins were eluted using 250 ng/μl 3X FLAG peptide (Sigma) in lysis buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The eluted proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were subjected to either Coomassie Blue staining using GelCode blue stain reagent (Pierce) or electrotransfer followed by Western blot analysis. Gel slices corresponding to FLAGrNIS as detected by Western blot analysis were excised, and in-gel proteolytic digestions were performed. In-gel Digestion and Phosphopeptide Enrichment—Gel slices were subjected to in-gel reduction with 10 mm dithiothreitol (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 56°C, followed by alkylation with 55 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Gel slices were washed and then incubated with sequence-grade trypsin solution (Promega) and 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic digestion solution was collected, and peptides were extracted twice with 60% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid (Riedel-de Haën). The peptide extracts were dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo Electron) to remove organic solvent and partial salts of ammonium bicarbonate. 20% of the dry peptide extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and 80% of the dry peptides were processed with a phosphopeptide capturing kit (MB-IMAC Fe, Bruker Daltonics) followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS—Peptide nanoflow LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on a linear quadrupole ion trap Fourier transform (LTQ-FT) ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (New Objective), an Agilent 1100 Series binary high-performance liquid chromatography pump (Agilent Technologies), and a Famos autosampler (LC Packings). In-gel tryptic peptide mixtures were injected at a 9-μl/min flow rate to a self-packed precolumn (150 μm, inner diameter × 20 mm) with C18 reverse phase resin (Magic C18AQ; particle size, 5 μm; pore size, 200 Å; Michrom Bioresources). Chromatographic separation of peptide mixtures was performed on a self-packed reversed phase C18 nanocolumn (75 μm, inner diameter × 30 cm) and an in-house prepared needle tip with an internal diameter of 3∼5 μm. Separation was achieved by using 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase A and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile as mobile phase B and applying a linear gradient from 10 to 40% mobile phase B during a 60-min LC-MS/MS analysis at a split flow rate of around 300 nl/min. Electrospray voltage was applied at 2.5 kV, and capillary temperature was set at 200 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in two different data-dependent survey scans based on phosphoric acid neutral loss trigger MS3 and speed. With phosphoric acid neutral loss trigger MS3 mode, a scan cycle was initiated with a full-scan survey mass spectrometry (MS; m/z 300–1800) experiment performed with the FT ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The three most abundant ions detected in this scan were subjected to an FT ion cyclotron resonance selected ion monitoring (±2.5 m/z) scan followed by a MS/MS experiment in a LTQ mass spectrometer with phosphoric acid neutral loss trigger MS3. Ion accumulation of auto gain control target and maximal ion accumulation time for MS, selected ion monitoring, and MS/MS were as follows: 1 × 106 ions, 1000 ms; 5 × 104 ions, 500 ms; and 5 × 104 ions, 500 ms, respectively. Resolution of full MS and selected ion monitoring was set as 2.5 × 104 and 5 × 104, respectively. MS/MS spectra were collected in the LTQ mass spectrometer, and ions were selected (±3 m/z) for MS/MS when their intensity exceeded a minimum threshold of 1000 counts. Singly charged ions were rejected by MS/MS. The normalized collision energy was set to 25%, and one microscan was acquired per spectrum. Ions subjected to MS/MS were excluded from further sequencing for 120 s (repeat count 2). Another scan cycle without MS3 was initiated with a full-scan survey MS experiment (m/z 320–1800; auto gain control target, 1 × 106 ions; resolution, 1 × 105; maximum ion accumulation time, 1000 ms) performed with the FT ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer followed by MS/MS experiments on the 10 most abundant ions detected in the full-MS scan. Except for neutral loss trigger MS3, the MS/MS setting was identical to the other mode setting. Peptide Assignments—The DTA files were outputted with Bioworks software (mass range, 640–5400 Da; threshold, absolute 100; precursor tolerance, 50 ppm; 0 group scan; 1 minimum group count; 5 minimum ion counts; Thermo Electron) and merged into a single file for further Mascot (version 2.1, Matrix Science) MS/MS ion searching in the Rattus database (SWISS-PROT). Peptide tolerances in MS and MS/MS modes for LTQ-FT were 5 ppm and 0.8 Da, respectively, in selected ion monitoring mode and 10 ppm and 0.8 Da in only full-scan mode. Two missed cleavages by trypsin were allowed. Only peptides with clear mass spectra with a Mascot score of >95% reliability were considered in this study. Ambiguous phosphorylation sites from Mascot scoring were further evaluated with post-translational modification scoring (7Olsen J.V. Blagoey B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2833) Google Scholar) using MSQuant software. Site-directed Mutagenesis—FLAGrNIS or FLAGhNIS (plasmid encoding human NIS tagged with a FLAG epitope at its extracellular N terminus in pcDNA3 vector) served as a template. FLAGrNIS or FLAGhNIS phospho-defective or phospho-mimicking mutant constructs were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequences of all cDNA constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Radioiodide Uptake Assay—Steady-state radioiodide accumulation was determined as follows. Cells were incubated with 2 μCi of Na125I in 5 μm nonradioactive NaI at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 30 min, a time point that reflects iodide accumulation in equilibrium. Cells were washed twice with cold Hanks' balanced salt solution and then lysed with cold 95% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature. Cell lysate was collected, and radioactivity was counted by a γ counter (Packard Instruments). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Iodide-dependent Kinetic Analysis—Cells were incubated for 2 min with varying concentrations of NaI (from 0 to 600 μm) containing Na125I of a specific activity of 80mCi/mmol. The amounts of accumulated iodide were measured as described above. The Km and Vmax values for I– were derived from the fitted Michaelis-Menten equation according to the Eadie-Hofstee plot. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% nonfat dry milk. Next, the membrane was incubated with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma, 1:1000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling, 1:4000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was detected by ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). To determine equal protein loading of total NIS proteins, the membrane was probed with mouse anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Abcam, 1:2000 dilution) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The signal intensities were measured densitometrically using NIH Image software. Nonpermeabilized Flow Cytometry Analysis—To detect cell surface NIS protein levels, flow cytometric analysis was performed using nonpermeabilized cells that were incubated with either a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma, 1:50 dilution) or an isotype IgG mouse control (Sigma, 1:50 dilution) for 1 h at 4°C followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma, 1:100 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and then resuspended in fixative buffer (1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) for analysis by a FACSCalibur flow cytofluorometer (BD Biosciences). The positive events region was gated at a fluorescence density that had <1% of cells with nonspecific fluorescence. Cell surface NIS levels were quantified by multiplying the percentage of cells by the mean fluorescence density in the gated region. Statistical Analysis—Comparisons between groups were performed using the paired t test. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Mass Spectrometry Identifies Five in Vivo Phosphorylated Amino Acid Residues in rNIS—Although it has been shown that NIS is a phosphoprotein (2Riedel C. Levy O. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21458-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), neither the phosphorylated amino acid residues nor the role of phosphorylation in NIS expression/activity has been reported. We first sought to directly identify in vivo phosphorylated amino acid residues in NIS using mass spectrometry. A heterologous expression system was employed to acquire sufficient amounts of immunopurified NIS protein for mass spectrometry analysis. We immunoprecipitated rat NIS tagged with a FLAG epitope at its extracellular N terminus (FLAGrNIS) from transfected HEK293 cells using anti-FLAG antibody M2 and subsequently conducted proteomic analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, the resulting proteolytic digestion in combination with LC-MS/MS fragmentation provided extensive sequence coverage of NIS protein of about 76%. Without enrichment for phosphopeptides, Ser-227 was identified as a phosphorylated amino acid residue in NIS by LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1B). Following enrichment for phosphopeptides by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, two additional phosphopeptides with four phosphorylated amino acid residues of NIS were identified. However, we found ambiguity between Thr-575 and Thr-577 of phosphopeptide EDTATTLEESLVK using the Mascot search engine. Accordingly, the ambiguity between Thr(P)-575 and Thr(P)-577 was evaluated by post-translational modification scoring using MSQuant software. The score of Thr(P)-577 was about twice the score of Thr(P)-575 after post-translational modification scoring. Differences in liquid chromatography retention times were used to distinguish between Ser(P)-43- and Thr(P)-49-containing phosphopeptides, as well as between Thr(P)-577- and Ser(P)-581-containing phosphopeptides. Based on the current proposed secondary structure of rNIS, the identified phosphorylated amino acid residues Ser-43, Thr-49, Thr-577 (or Thr-575), and Ser-581 are in the intracellular domains of NIS protein (Fig. 1C). However, Ser-227 is predicted to be in the extracellular domains of NIS protein, which is an unusual location for phosphorylation. Nonetheless, neutral loss of H3PO4 did occur in the MS/MS fragmentation, and the MS/MS fragmentation assignment of Ser(P)-227 from Mascot scoring was high. The estimated stoichiometry of Ser(P)-227 as measured by using the algorithm published by Wu et al. (8Wu S.L. Kim J. Bandle R.W. Liotta L. Petricoin E. Karger B.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 1610-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was 6.65 ± 0.8%. In summary, we successfully identified five in vivo phosphorylated amino acid residues in NIS protein by mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation Status of Ser-43 and Ser-581 Modulates NIS Activity without Altering Total or Cell Surface NIS Protein Levels—To examine the functional importance of the identified phosphorylated amino acid residues, we generated NIS phospho-defective or phospho-mimicking mutants of the corresponding amino acid residue to evaluate NIS-mediated RAIU activity and total NIS protein levels as well as cell surface NIS levels in transfected HEK293 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to replace the selected phosphorylated serine/threonine residue in FLAGrNIS with either alanine or aspartic acid. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 2A, cells expressing NIS phospho-defective single mutants S43A, T49A, T577A, and S581A, but not S227A or T575A, had reduced NIS-mediated RAIU activity of ∼30–60% that of wild-type FLAGrNIS. Conversely, NIS phospho-mimicking single mutants S43D, T577D, and S581D had RAIU activity comparable with that of wild-type FLAGrNIS (Fig. 2A, right panel). These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Ser-43, Thr-577, or Ser-581 modulates NIS activity. In comparison, both T49A and T49D mutations resulted in reduced RAIU activity of similar extent; thus the role of phosphorylation status of Thr-49 in NIS activity is uncertain. Consistent with the prediction of proteomic analysis, T577A, but not T575A, resulted in reduced RAIU activity. In Fig. 2B, we show that total NIS protein levels were not different among cells expressing wild-type FLAGrNIS or NIS phospho-defective or phospho-mimicking mutants of Ser-43, Thr-49, or Ser-581 with the exception of cells expressing T577A. Whereas mutation to T577A resulted in reduced total NIS protein levels, mutation to T577D resulted in total NIS protein levels comparable with those of wild-type FLAGrNIS. These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Thr-577 may alter NIS protein stability. As NIS-mediated RAIU activity is determined by NIS expression at the cell surface, we next examined cell surface NIS levels by flow cytometric analysis in nonpermeabilized cells expressing NIS phospho-defective or phospho-mimicking single mutants. Consistent with the results of total NIS protein levels, cell surface NIS levels were comparable among cells expressing NIS phospho-defective or phosphomimicking mutants of Ser-43, Thr-49, or Ser-581, except for T577A (Fig. 2C). As summarized in Fig. 2D, we found that the phosphorylation status of Ser-43 and Ser-581 modulates NIS activity without notable changes to total or cell surface NIS protein levels. The Effects of Ser(P)-43 and Ser(P)-581 on NIS Activity Are Additive—To investigate whether phosphorylation of both amino acid residues Ser-43 and Ser-581 is important to confer optimal NIS activity, we generated NIS phospho-defective or phospho-mimicking double mutants at the two corresponding serine residues and examined NIS-mediated RAIU activity and NIS protein levels. As shown in Fig. 3A, NIS double mutants S43A/S581A, S43A/S581D, and S43D/S581A had reduced RAIU activity of about 40, 60, and 60%, respectively, compared with that of wild-type FLAGrNIS. These results suggest that the effects of Ser(P)-43 and Ser(P)-581 on NIS activity are additive. Indeed, S43A/S581D and S43D/S581A mutants had a similar extent of reduced RAIU activity compared with S43A and S581A mutants (Fig. 3A versus Fig. 2A), as the single mutants S43A and S581A could have Ser-581 and Ser-43, respectively, phosphorylated. In addition, NIS double mutant S43D/S581D had RAIU activity comparable with that of S43D, S581D, or wild-type FLAGrNIS (Fig. 3A versus Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, we observed no difference in total NIS protein levels or cell surface NIS levels among all four NIS double mutants of Ser-43, Ser-581, and wild-type FLAGrNIS. As summarized in Fig. 3D, phosphorylation of either Ser-43 or Ser-581 alone does not achieve optimal NIS activity. Threonine Residue at Position 49 Provides an Important Structural Constraint for Optimal NIS Activity—To further examine whether structural geometry or phosphorylation status of Thr-49 is important for optimal NIS activity, we generated the T49S mutant and evaluated NIS-mediated RAIU activity as well as protein levels. We found that the T49S mutant had a similar extent of reduced RAIU activity (Fig. 4A) compared with either the T49A or T49D mutant (Fig. 2A). As serine represents a phospho-group-accepting amino acid residue that often is used to substitute for threonine, we concluded that the phosphorylation status of Thr-49 might not play an important role for optimal NIS activity. Instead, the structural geometry provided by the threonine residue at position 49 is important to achieve proper local structure/conformation of NIS protein for optimal activity. In comparison, we found that the S43T mutant had RAIU activity comparable with that of the S43D mutant as well as wild-type FLAGrNIS. These results suggest that the phosphorylation status of Ser-43 modulates NIS functional activity. Total NIS protein levels (Fig. 4B) and cell surface NIS protein levels (Fig. 4C) of S43T and T49S mutants were comparable with those of wild-type FLAGrNIS. Functional Importance of Phosphorylation Status of Ser-43 Is Conserved between Rat and Human Species—Sequence analysis has shown that human NIS protein exhibits 84% identity and 92% similarity to rat NIS protein (9Smanik P.A. Liu Q. Furminger T.L. Ryu K. Xing S. Mazzaferri E.L. Jhiang S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Three of the five identified phosphorylated amino acid residues in rat NIS, Ser-43, Thr-49, and Ser-227, are conserved in human NIS. As the identified phosphorylated amino acid residue Ser-43 and its surrounding amino acid sequences are highly conserved between rat and human NIS, we next examined the role of phosphorylation status of Ser-43 in modulating human NIS functional activity and expression levels. Similarly, the hNIS S43A mutant had reduced RAIU activity, and the hNIS S43D mutant had RAIU activity comparable with that of wild-type FLAGhNIS (Fig. 5A). Both hNIS S43A and S43D mutants had total NIS protein levels (Fig. 5B) and cell surface NIS protein levels (Fig. 5C) comparable with those of wild-type FLAGhNIS. Phospho-defective Mutant of either Ser-43 or Ser-581 Has Reduced Transport Rate of Iodide—Because the cell surface NIS level was not decreased in cells expressing S43A or S581A, we examined their kinetic properties of I– uptake. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, cells expressing S43A or S581A had reduced maximal rate of I– transport (Vmax) by 36 ± 11.7 and 59 ± 12.6%, respectively, compared with cells expressing wild-type FLAGrNIS. The finding that S43A or S581A had no apparent effect on Km for I– indicated that their reduced steady-state RAIU activity was not contributed by decreased NIS binding affinity for substrate I– (Fig. 6C). Taken together, phosphorylation of Ser-43 and Ser-581 appears to increase NIS-mediated RAIU activity by increasing the velocity of iodide transport. Phosphorylation can affect the functional activity, subcellular localization, and/or protein stability of various channels and transporters (10Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. J. Am. Soc.

Neurochem. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that NIS is a phosphorylated protein in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells (2Riedel C. Levy O. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21458-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), no phosphorylated amino acid residues have yet been identified. In this study, we identified Ser-43, Thr-49, Ser-227, Thr-577, and Ser-581 as in vivo phosphorylated amino acid residues in rNIS expressed in heterologous HEK293 cells. We found that the velocity of iodide transport of rNIS is modulated by the phosphorylation status of Ser-43 and Ser-581 and that NIS protein stability may be modulated by the phosphorylation status of Thr-577. However, NIS cell surface trafficking was not affected by the phosphorylation status of these five amino acid residues. We have shown that NIS expression and functional activity could be modulated by post-translational modification through distinct mechanisms. Based on current proposed topology, the intracellular domains of rNIS contain 28 serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, of which Ser-43, Tyr-269, Thr-442, Thr-548, Ser-551, Ser-552, Thr-566, Thr-575, Thr-577, Ser-581, Thr-593, and Thr-605 are possibly phosphorylated as analyzed by phosphorylation prediction programs KinasePhos, NetPhos2.0, Pred-Phospho, and Prosite. In this study, we showed that the predicted phosphorylation residues Ser-43, Thr-577, and Ser-581 are indeed phosphorylated in vivo. The fact that Thr-49 and Ser-227 were not predicted to be phosphorylated by all four phosphorylation prediction programs underscores the importance of unbiased experimental approaches such as mass spectrometry to localize phosphorylation sites. It is difficult to conclude whether Tyr-269, Thr-442, Thr-548, Ser-551, Ser-552, Thr-566, Thr-575, Thr-593, and Thr-605 amino acid residues are not phosphorylated in vivo because of the transient nature of this post-translational modification. In addition, it is important to note that Ser-43, Thr-49, Ser-227, Thr-577, and Ser-581 were identified as phosphorylated amino acid residues under nonstimulated conditions. Thus, additional amino acid residues, such as those amino acid residues that were predicted to be phosphorylated, may be phosphorylated upon activation of various signaling. Although the phosphorylation of Ser-227 in rNIS appears to be functionally silent, Ser-227 is nevertheless phosphorylated in vivo. It was surprising to have identified Ser-227 as a phosphorylated amino acid residue by LC-MS/MS analysis, as it is in close proximity to the experimentally determined N-linked glycosylation site Asn-225 (19Levy O. De la Vieja A. Ginter C.S. Riedel C. Dai G. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22657-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This indicates that Ser-227 is possibly located in the extracellular domains of rNIS. Phosphorylation of amino acid residues located in the extracellular regions of membrane proteins has been reported. Two tyrosine residues located in the extracellular domains of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 were identified independently as phosphorylated residues by two different groups of investigators (20Hou J. McKeehan K. Kan M. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Crabb J.W. KcKeehan W.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Hinsby A.M. Olsen J.V. Bennett K.L. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 1: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of extracellular domains of T-lymphocyte surface proteins was also reported (22Apasov S.G. Smith P.T. Jelonek M.T. Marguilies D.H. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25677-25683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of extracellularly located amino acid residues is not unprecedented, it is nevertheless unusual. Alternatively, Ser-227 may be located in the intracellular domain, as conclusive topology of NIS has yet to be resolved by x-ray crystallography. Molecular analyses of NIS missense mutations occurring in patients with congenital iodide transport defects have revealed not only the amino acid residues but also the underlying mechanisms that are critical for optimal NIS activity. It has been shown that substitution of glutamic acid at position 267 with any charged residue reduces NIS activity without decreasing NIS cell surface (23De la Vieja A. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of an uncharged amino acid residue with a small side chain at position 395 (24Dohan O. Gavrielides M.V. Ginter C. Amzel L.M. Carrasco N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as well as the presence of a hydroxyl group at position 354 (25Levy O. Ginter C.S. De la Vieja A. Levy D. Carrasco N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), is required for optimal NIS activity. Finally, De la Vieja et al. (26De la Vieja A. Reed M.D. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25290-25298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) recently reported that Asn-360, Asp-369, and the hydroxyl group containing residues Thr-351, Ser-353, Thr-354, Ser-356, and Thr-357 play key roles in Na+ binding/translocation. In this study, we showed that substitution of phosphorylation residue Thr-49 with Ala, Asp, or Ser resulted in partial NIS activity of similar extent without affecting NIS protein levels. Thus, the structural constraint provided by the threonine residue at position 49, rather than its phosphorylation status, is important for NIS to achieve optimal activity. The finding that T577A had reduced total protein levels, whereas T577D had total protein levels equivalent to those of wild-type NIS, suggests that the phosphorylation status of Thr-577 may affect NIS protein stability. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a structural change of T577A targets it for degradation, which may not occur in the corresponding nonphosphorylated residue in wild-type NIS. Interestingly, during our initial proteomic analysis, we identified ubiquitin as a possible NIS-associated protein and later confirmed their association by co-immunoprecipitation studies (data not shown). Several studies have reported the role of phosphorylation as inhibitory to protein ubiquitination. Rolli-Derkinderen et al. (27Rolli-Derkinderen M. Sauzeau V. Boyer L. Lemichez E. Baron C. Henrion D. Loirand G. Pacaud P. Circ. Res. 2005; 11: 1152-1160Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) stated that phosphorylation of Ser-188 in RhoA prevented its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that phospho-defective mutation of Bcl-2 at three amino acid residues rendered it susceptible to ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (28Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1886-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It is well established that phosphorylation can directly affect the activity of transporters and channels (10Han X. Budreau A.M. Chesney R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1874-1879PubMed Google Scholar, 11Surti T.S. Huang L. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cooper E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9313-9319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this study, we conclude that phosphorylation of NIS at both Ser-43 and Ser-581 residues is required for its optimal activity. In addition, kinetic analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of these two sites does not affect the binding affinity for iodide, but rather the velocity of I– transport. It would be most interesting to identify the kinases/phosphatases that modulate NIS phosphorylation status at these two residues. Using consensus motif programs GPS, KinasePhos, MotifScan, NetPhosK1.0, and PPSP, we have identified CK1, IPL1, and polo-like kinase as candidate kinases that may phosphorylate both Ser-43 and Ser-581 residues. However, CK2, G protein-coupled receptorkinase,phosphorylasekinase,proteinkinaseCζ,cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and S6 protein kinase are predicted to phosphorylate Ser-43 but not Ser-581, whereas IκB kinase, MAPK kinase kinase, NIMA, and p21-activated kinase may possibly phosphorylate Ser-581 but not Ser-43. The roles of these candidate kinases in phosphorylation of Ser-43 or Ser-581 as well as in NIS activity need to be further explored. Alternatively, we are currently in the process of screening for kinases that modulate NIS functional activity using a small interfering RNA library targeting 719 kinases. As the cellular context of various cells may be different, the sites of phosphorylation in NIS may also be different in heterologous HEK293 cells and endogenous NIS-expressing cells. As it is difficult to immunopurify sufficient amounts of endogenous NIS for mass spectrometry analysis, it would be desirable to generate phospho-site-specific antibodies to confirm that the corresponding sites are also phosphorylated in endogenous NIS. Interestingly, we reported previously that MEK inhibitor PD98059 decreased NIS activity by decreasing the velocity of iodide transport by a yet-to-be-identified mechanism (3Vadysirisack D.D. Venkateswaran A. Zhang Z. Jhiang S.M. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2007; 2: 421-432Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether the NIS S43D or S581D mutant would be resistant to PD98059 inhibition of NIS activity. However, both S43D and S581D remained sensitive to PD98059 inhibition of NIS activity (data not shown). We thus conclude that PD98059 does not appear to modulate NIS activity by altering the phosphorylation status of Ser-43 or Ser-581. In summary, our study advances our knowledge of NIS modulation at the post-translational levels. We have identified Ser-43, Thr-49, Ser-227, Thr-577, and Ser-581 as in vivo phosphorylated amino acid residues in NIS and demonstrated their functional importance. Our findings indicate that NIS expression and activity can be modulated by phosphorylation at different amino acid residues. Accordingly, NIS expression and activity may be subjected to modulation by multiple signaling pathways involved in activation/inactivation of kinases/phosphatases. Indeed, NIS phosphorylation has been shown to be modulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone, which activates multiple signaling pathways in thyroid cells. Furthermore, inhibition of the MEK/MAPK signaling pathway, which is frequently activated in thyroid cancer, appears to increase NIS expression levels but decrease its activity. A better understanding of the cellular factors involved in controlling the phosphorylation status of NIS may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for improved NIS-mediated radionuclide treatment of thyroid cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2019633893,"Background The thymus constitutes the primary lymphoid organ for the majority of T cells. The phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is involved in lymphoid development. Defects in single components of this pathway prevent thymocytes from progressing beyond early T cell developmental stages. Protein kinase B (PKB) is the main effector of the PI3K pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings To determine whether PKB mediates PI3K signaling in the thymus, we characterized PKB knockout thymi. Our results reveal a significant thymic hypocellularity in PKBα−/− neonates and an accumulation of early thymocyte subsets in PKBα−/− adult mice. Using thymic grafting and fetal liver cell transfer experiments, the latter finding was specifically attributed to the lack of PKBα within the lymphoid component of the thymus. Microarray analyses show that the absence of PKBα in early thymocyte subsets modifies the expression of genes known to be involved in pre-TCR signaling, in T cell activation, and in the transduction of interferon-mediated signals. Conclusions/Significance This report highlights the specific requirements of PKBα for thymic development and opens up new prospects as to the mechanism downstream of PKBα in early thymocytes."

Whereas sGC has been the focus of extensive study, the mechanism of enzyme activation remains a topic of debate (5Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pending the elucidation of the structure, details about the heme pocket and sGC activation continue to be probed through biochemical methods. sGC is a heterodimeric protein consisting of two homologous subunits, α1 and β1. Despite having the same histidine-ligated heme cofactor as the globins, sGC is isolated as a stable ferrous species that does not bind oxygen (O2) (8Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5636-5640Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Studies using truncations of sGC have localized the catalytic domains to the C terminus of both the α1 and β1 subunits (9Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4083-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the heme binding domain to the N terminus of the β1 subunit (10Karow D.S. Pan D. Davis J.H. Behrends S. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16266-16274Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activation of sGC was once thought to be directly linked to NO binding to the heme cofactor on the β1 subunit (11Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 12Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. Ballou D.P. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); however, recent data has shown that a low activity ferrous nitrosyl complex can be isolated (5Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This complex, which can be formed in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of NO, is spectroscopically identical to the highly active form of the enzyme that is formed in the presence of substrate or excess NO. Based on these observations two mechanisms of NO activation have been proposed. One proposal is that excess NO activates the ferrous nitrosyl complex by binding to a non-heme site(s) on the protein (5Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The second proposal involves excess NO binding to the heme to form a transient dinitrosyl complex, which then converts to a 5-coordinate complex with NO bound in the proximal heme pocket (13Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A ligand capable of binding to the heme tightly enough to prevent NO binding could be used to investigate activation by NO independent of coordination to the heme, but the high Kd and instability of known sGC heme ligands, such as CO and nitrosoalkanes, make them poor candidates for such a study (14Derbyshire E.R. Tran R. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16257-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16397-16403Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Significant insight into the heme binding pocket of the globins has been obtained through studies with alkyl isocyanides (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar). For example, the heme cofactors in hemoglobin and myoglobin were first proposed to be buried within the proteins based on the observation that larger, more hydrophobic alkyl isocyanides had increased rates of binding to the heme (17George R.C.C. Pauling L. Science. 1951; 114: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Lein A. Pauling L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1956; 42: 51-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, alkyl isocyanides have been used in crystallographic studies with the truncated hemoglobin of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (19Milani M. Pesce A. Ouellet Y. Dewilde S. Friedman J. Ascenzi P. Guertin M. Bolognesi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21520-21525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the P450 nitric oxide reductase of Fusarium oxysporum (20Lee D.S. Park S.Y. Yamane K. Obayashi E. Hori H. Shiro Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the P450 d-camphor hydroxylase of Pseudomonas putida (20Lee D.S. Park S.Y. Yamane K. Obayashi E. Hori H. Shiro Y. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2669-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to obtain details about the effects of ligand binding on the chemical environment around the heme. In this paper, we report the use of the alkyl isocyanide, n-butyl isocyanide (BIC, Fig. 1, inset), to probe the mechanism of activation of sGC. BIC binds to the sGC heme and activates the enzyme 2-5-fold. Like other heme ligands (21Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), BIC synergizes with the allosteric activator YC-1. Our data show that the mechanism of synergistic activation by YC-1 varies depending on the heme ligand. For sGC complexes with NO and CO, YC-1 decreases the Km for GTP 3-4-fold (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandish P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas a 7-fold increase in the Km is observed when YC-1 is added to the sGC-BIC complex. BIC was also used to investigate the effect of non-heme-bound NO on sGC activation by blocking the heme coordination site and thus preventing NO binding. We show that NO can activate the Fe-BIC complex without displacing BIC at the heme, providing further support for the proposal that NO activates sGC by a mechanism that is more complex than simple coordination to the sGC heme. Materials—sGC, which is isolated as the 5-coordinate histidyl-ligated ferrous protein, was expressed using a baculovirus/Sf9 expression system and purified as previously described (23Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Diethylammonium (Z)-1-(N,N-diethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (DEA/NO) was from Cayman Chemical Co. All other reagents were from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. Preparation of the sGC-BIC Complex—All experiments were carried out with as-isolated ferrous sGC. Electronic absorption spectra were collected on a CARY 3E spectrophotometer with a Neslab RTE-100 temperature controller set at 25 °C. Spectra were collected over the range of 700-250 nm. BIC stocks were made up in Me2SO. Purified sGC (0.8 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl was scanned before and after addition of 1 mm BIC. The final concentration of Me2SO was 1%. Stopped-flow Kinetics—The dissociation of BIC from sGC was measured on a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a Neslab RTE-100 temperature controller set at 25 °C. BIC (4 μm) was added to sGC (1 μm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. A spectrum was collected on a CARY 3E spectrophotometer to ensure the sGC-BIC complex was formed. A solution of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT in a Teflon-sealed Reacti-Vial (Pierce) was made anaerobic by vacuum/argon cycling on an oxygen-scavenged gas train before addition of 100 μm DEA/NO with a gas-tight Hamilton syringe. After 20 min at room temperature the DEA/NO solution was mixed rapidly with an equal volume of a solution of the sGC-BIC complex. Spectra were collected at 25 °C over the range of 680-340 nm. The integration time was 0.00125 s and the run time was 0.6 s. Spectra were corrected for baseline drift by normalization to an isosbestic point at 411 nm. Difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of the time 0 spectrum from all subsequent spectra. ΔA394 and ΔA425 values were extracted from the difference spectra and ΔA394 - ΔA425 was plotted versus time for each experiment. The data were fit to a single exponential (A = At(1-e-kt)) to obtain the BIC off-rate. The experiment was repeated 3 times and the determined rates were averaged. Activation of sGC with BIC and YC-1—Duplicate end-point assays were performed at 25 °C as previously described (23Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A stock solution of MgGTP was made with 50 mm MgCl2 and 20 mm GTP. A 10 mm DEA/NO solution was prepared in 10 mm NaOH. Stock solutions of 10 mm butyl isocyanide, 1 m nitrobutane, and 15 mm YC-1 were prepared in Me2SO. A 0.5 m dithionite stock in H2O was prepared in a Teflon-sealed Reacti-Vial using an anaerobic chamber (Coy). A Teflon-sealed Reacti-Vial was filled with CO (Praxair, Inc.). Nitrosobutane was generated by the addition of 10 μl of the dithionite solution to 10 μl of nitrobutane using a gas-tight syringe immediately before the addition of nitrosobutane to the assay mixture as described previously (14Derbyshire E.R. Tran R. Mathies R.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16257-16265Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures contained 0.2 μg of sGC, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 150 μm YC-1 where indicated. DEA/NO (100 μm), 10 μl of CO gas with a gas-tight syringe, 2 μl of the nitrosobutane stock solution, or butyl isocyanide (10 μm) were added to the enzyme. sGC enzyme assays were initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm GTP. All assays were in a final volume of 100 μl and contained 2% Me2SO, which did not affect enzyme activity. Reactions were quenched after 3 min by the addition of 400 μl of 125 mm Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 500 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3. cGMP quantification was carried out using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit, Format B (Biomol), per the manufacturer's instructions. Each experiment was repeated 4 times to ensure reproducibility. Determination of the KA of BIC Activation—Duplicate end-point assays were performed at 25 °C. Assay mixtures contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, BIC, and 150 μm YC-1, where indicated. The BIC concentration was varied from 0 to 10 μm. Assays were initiated by the addition of 0.2 μg of sGC. All assays were in a final volume of 100 μl and contained 2% Me2SO. Reactions were quenched after 3 min by the addition of 400 μl of 125 mm Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 500 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3. cGMP quantification was carried out as described above. Each experiment was repeated 3 times to ensure reproducibility. The resulting data were fit with the equation for nonessential activation to obtain a KA (24Segel I.H. Enzyme-Kinetics,-Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), where Vmax(app) is the apparent Vmax at a given [BIC]; Vmax(basal) is the Vmax of the unactivated enzyme; β is the ratio of the Vmax at saturating BIC over Vmax without activator; α is the ratio of the Km of GTP in the presence of saturating BIC over the Km of GTP in the absence of BIC; and KA is the equilibrium constant for activating the enzyme. Vmax(app)=Vmax(basal){1+β[BIC]/αKA}1+[BIC]/αKA(Eq. 1) Determination of the GTP Km—To determine the Km for GTP with sGC, sGC-BIC, and sGC-BIC in the presence of YC-1, duplicate end-point assays were performed at 25 °C. The assay mixture contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm BIC, and 150 μm YC-1 where indicated. The GTP concentration ranged from 0.0025 to 1 mm. The samples were quenched and assayed as described above. The resulting data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain Km values. The experiments were repeated 3 times to ensure reproducibility. Effect of NO on the Activity of the sGC-BIC Complex—The sGC-BIC complex was prepared by adding 10 mm BIC to sGC (550 nm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT in a 50-μl cuvette (Starna Cells, Inc.) at 25 °C. After 1 min, 10 μm DEA/NO was added to the sample and the protein was monitored with a spectrophotometer to confirm that BIC remained bound to the sGC heme. The reaction was initiated by addition of MgCl2 and GTP (3 and 1 mm, respectively) 12 min after the addition of DEA/NO. The assay was quenched after 2 min by aliquoting 50 μl of the sample into a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing 450 μl of 125 mm Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 500 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3. Spectra were collected over the range of 700-350 nm immediately before and after the sample was quenched. Control reactions excluding BIC, DEA/NO, and both BIC and DEA/NO were also carried out under the same experimental conditions. A parallel set of experiments was carried out with the addition of 10 mm dithionite to all samples 2 min before the addition of substrate, to eliminate excess NO. All experiments were repeated 3 times to ensure reproducibility. Displacement of Heme-bound NO by BIC—The sGC-NO complex was made by addition of 10 μm DEA/NO to sGC (400 nm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT in a 50-μl cuvette. After 7 min at 25 °C, BIC (10 mm) was added to the solution containing the sGC-NO complex and displacement of NO by BIC was monitored spectrally by following the change in the absorbance maximum from 399 to 429 nm. After displacement of NO by BIC, MgCl2 and GTP were added to the protein to final concentrations of 3 and 1 mm, respectively. Reactions were quenched after 2 min by aliquoting 50 μl of the sample into a 1.5-ml microtube containing 450 μl of 125 mm Zn(CH3CO2)2 and 500 μl of 125 mm Na2CO3. Spectra were collected over the range of 700-350 nm immediately before and after the sample was quenched. Controls with sGC-NO, sGC-BIC, and unligated sGC were done following the above procedure, but excluding BIC, DEA/NO, and both BIC and DEA/NO, respectively. The experiment was repeated 3 times to ensure reproducibility. Binding of BIC to sGC—When BIC is added to ferrous sGC, the absorbance maximum shifts from 431 to 429 nm and the broad α/β peak at 562 nm splits into peaks at 561 and 530 nm (Fig. 1). A similar change in the absorbance spectrum occurs when alkyl isocyanides bind to myoglobin and hemoglobin (Table 1). The spectral characteristics of the sGC-BIC complex suggests that it is 6-coordinate, and that binding likely occurs through the isocyanide carbon atom in a manner analogous to that observed for the globins (16Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar).TABLE 1Electronic absorption peak positions for various ligands bound to hemoglobin, myoglobin, and sGC All peak positions are in nanometers.ProteinLigandSoretα/βRef.HbNO418574/54536Mansuy D.

In these experiments a low concentration of BIC (2 μm) was displaced from sGC by an excess of NO (50 μm DEA/NO). The change in absorbance from 429 to 399 nm was monitored as a function of time at 25 °C. ΔΔAbs (396-425) versus time was plotted and the data were fit to a single exponential to obtain the observed rate constants for BIC dissociation (Fig. 2). The observed rate of 6.51 ± 0.09 s-1 did not change when the concentration of NO was increased, indicating that the concentration of NO used was effectively preventing BIC rebinding. The presence of 75 μm YC-1 and/or 1 mm GTP did not significantly affect the BIC dissociation rate. Activation of sGC by BIC—Saturating concentrations of NO, CO, nitrosobutane, and BIC were used to compare sGC activation by the various heme ligands in the presence and absence of YC-1 at 25 °C (Fig. 3). BIC activated sGC 2-5-fold, similar to CO and nitrosobutane. Synergism between YC-1 and BIC led to a 15-25-fold activation of sGC, which is similar to the synergism observed with YC-1 and nitrosobutane. sGC activity was monitored as a function of BIC concentration (±150 μm YC-1) to obtain the parameters α (the effect of BIC on the Km for GTP) and β (the effect of BIC on the Vmax), which are used to calculate the KA, the equilibrium constant for BIC activation. Specifically, data were fit to the equation for nonessential activation to obtain an αKA of 1.4 μm and a β of 1.5 in the presence of BIC and an αKA of 0.54 μm and a β of 6.1 with BIC and YC-1 (Fig. 4). To determine α, which is the ratio of KmGTP in the presence of saturating BIC over the KmGTP without BIC, the KmGTP of sGC and the sGC-BIC complex in the presence and absence of YC-1 was determined (Fig. 5). The Km of sGC, sGC-BIC, and sGC-BIC in the presence of YC-1 was determined to be 74 ± 20, 40 ± 13, and 547 ± 90 μm, respectively (Table 2). This shows that, similar to the heme activators NO and CO (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandish P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), BIC decreases the Km for GTP. Whereas YC-1 decreases the Km of the sGC-NO and sGC-CO complexes, the Km of the sGC-BIC complex increases ∼7-fold in the presence of YC-1. The effect of YC-1 on the Km of the sGC-BIC complex does not appear to be due to the size of the heme ligand, as the Km of the sGC-nitrosobutane complex was determined to be 181 ± 45 and 162 ± 68 μm in the absence and presence of YC-1, respectively. Using the reported Km values in the equation for a nonessential activator the KA of BIC activation is 2.55 μm in the absence of YC-1 and 0.073 μm in the presence of YC-1.FIGURE 5Determination of Km values for sGC (0.2 μg) in the presence of (A) 0 μm BIC and 0 μm YC-1, (B) 100 μm BIC and 0 μm YC-1, and (C) 100 μm BIC and 150 μm YC-1 at 25 °C.

Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 13Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The isolation of a 5-coordinate ferrous nitrosyl complex with low activity, and the ability to fully activate this complex with excess NO has led to the revision of the activation model of sGC by NO. Proposals for the mechanism of activation of sGC by excess NO include binding of NO to a non-heme binding site (5Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and binding of NO to the proximal side of the heme (13Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). BIC was used to block the binding of NO to the sGC heme, allowing the measurement of the effect of non-heme NO on sGC activity. Electronic absorption spectroscopy shows that the absorbance maximum of the sGC-BIC complex at 429 nm is shifted to 432 nm in the presence of NO (Fig. 6A). Whereas this shift in absorbance indicates there is a change within the heme pocket in the presence of excess NO, the absence of a peak at 399 nm indicates that NO does not displace BIC at the heme. Furthermore, experiments using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy rule out the formation of a 6-coordinate BIC-Fe-NO complex (see below). When excess dithionite is added to destroy the excess NO (dithionite has been used extensively as an NO trap in studies of NO dissociation from hemoproteins (23Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Moore E.G. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2788-2794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the spectrum of the sGC-BIC complexes are not affected (data not shown). This indicates the 432-nm sGC-BIC species is stable in the presence of dithionite. The activity of the sGC-BIC complex in the presence and absence of NO and dithionite was measured to test if excess NO can activate the sGC-BIC complex. Fig. 6B shows that the activity of the sGC-BIC complex increases from 5- to 89-fold in the presence of excess NO, reaching a level that is 24% of the maximum enzyme activity obtained in this experiment. When dithionite is added to the sGC complexes to destroy any free NO, the activity of the sGC-BIC species decreases from 89- to 3-fold (Fig. 6B). Control assays indicated that the products formed during the reaction of NO with dithionite do not inhibit the activity of the sGC-BIC complex (data not shown). Destruction of excess NO also decreases activation of the sGC-NO complex, as previously reported (5Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Additionally, NO was removed from the sGC samples by desalting into an NO free buffer. The activity of the sGC-BIC complex in the presence of NO decreased when NO was removed from the sample by desalting. This activity was restored upon addition of NO, without a change in the electronic absorption spectrum of the sGC-BIC complex (data not shown). Both the destruction of NO by dithionite and the removal of NO by buffer exchange lead to a decrease in the NO-induced activation of the sGC-BIC complex. Electronic absorption spectroscopy also shows that an excess of BIC (10 mm) is able to completely displace NO from the sGC heme (Fig. 7A). As another means of probing the mechanism of NO activation, sGC was assayed after all heme-bound NO was displaced by BIC (Fig. 7B). The sGC-BIC complex that formed after displacing NO is activated 45-fold, compared with the 4-fold activity observed for the sGC-BIC complex made in the absence of NO. The observed sGC-BIC activity in the presence of excess NO was 24% of the maximum activity observed for sGC-NO under these experimental conditions. EPR spectroscopy is a sensitive method for detecting paramagnetic centers, like 5- and 6-coordinate Fe-NO complexes (27Szabo A. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4427-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28Ubbink M. Worrall J.A. Canters G.W. Groenen E.J. Huber M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 393-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These complexes have well characterized signals, whereas diamagnetic species are EPR silent (29Stone J.R. Sands R.H. Dunham W.R. Marletta M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 207: 572-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Zhao Y. Hoganson C. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12458-12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). No signal was observed for the sGC-BIC complex made in the absence or presence of NO (data not shown). Based on a calibration curve carried out with the sGC heme domain, EPR would detect the presence of any Fe-NO complex in amounts ≥2% of the total protein in the sample. The absence of an EPR signal indicates that NO was not coordinating to either the distal or proximal heme site in the sGC-BIC complex formed in the presence of NO. Thus, NO coordination to the heme cannot account for the NO-induced activation of the sGC-BIC complex. Several biochemical methods have been used to address critical questions about NO activation of sGC, but the details of this mechanism remain unresolved. Spectroscopic studies have focused on the diatomic gases NO and CO, however, alkyl-substituted ligands, such as nitrosoalkanes (RNO) and alkyl isocyanides (RNC), can be used to probe the heme environment and the mechanism of activation. We show that BIC binds to sGC to form a 6-coordinate, low-spin complex with an absorbance maximum at 429 nm (Fig. 1). The observed dissociation rate of BIC from the heme, 6.51 ± 0.09 s-1, was monitored by using NO as a heme trap. This method was only successful when a low concentration of BIC was used to form the sGC complex, and a large excess of NO was added to trap the ligand-free heme. This indicates that BIC dissociation is slightly slower than CO (10.5 s-1, adjusted to 25 °C) (15Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16397-16403Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and much faster than NO (23Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). GTP and YC-1 are known to affect the dissociation rates of NO and CO from the sGC heme (23Winger J.A. Derbyshire E.R. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10699-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the BIC dissociation rate was unaffected by the presence of either molecule. Unfortunately, due to the small change in absorbance when BIC binds to sGC (431 to 429 nm) and limitations in obtaining protein, we were unable to determine the BIC association rate. While this prevents the determination of the Kd of BIC binding to the heme, the KA, or Kd of activation can be investigated. This is a useful method of estimating how well BIC binds, because activity studies on sGC require less protein than spectral studies, and a sensitive assay for cGMP detection has already been established. BIC activates sGC 2-5-fold, similar to other ligands that form 6-coordinate complexes (Fig. 3). YC-1 synergizes with the sGC-BIC complex to activate the enzyme 15-25-fold. This potentiation of BIC-stimulated activity (∼6-fold) is similar to that of nitrosobutane-stimulated activity (∼8-fold). However, this YC-1-induced activation is less than that observed for the sGC-CO complex, which can be activated to a level similar to that observed in the presence of NO. This difference in the degree of YC-1-induced activation may reflect the difference in sizes between nitrosobutane and BIC, as compared to CO. It has been shown that YC-1, NO, and CO are mixed-type sGC activators, as they increase Vmax and decrease the Km for GTP (22Denninger J.W. Schelvis J.P.M. Brandish P.E. Zhao Y. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This report shows that BIC is also a mixed-type activator. Interestingly, the presence of YC-1 led to a ∼7-fold increase in the Km for GTP for the sGC-BIC complex. The effect of YC-1 on the activity of the sGC-nitrosobutane complex was also examined to determine whether an increase in Km is a general property of sGC bound to alkyl-substituted heme ligands. Nitrosobutane in the presence and absence of YC-1 did not lead to a significant increase in the Km when compared with the unactivated enzyme (Table 2). This indicates that the mechanism of YC-1 activation varies depending on the ligand bound at the sGC heme, and suggests that the binding of BIC and YC-1 somehow inhibits GTP binding and/or release of cGMP. Using the determined Km values for GTP, the KA of BIC activation is 2.55 and 0.073 μm in the absence and presence of YC-1, respectively. Assuming BIC activates sGC by binding exclusively to the heme, the ligand has a relatively high affinity for the sGC heme and can be used to probe NO activation. Proposals for excess NO activation of the sGC-NO complex include binding to a non-heme site (5Cary S.P. Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13064-13069Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and to the proximal side of the heme (13Russwurm M. Koesling D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). If a non-heme NO binding site exists, then non-heme NO might be able to activate other sGC iron-ligand complexes. To test this hypothesis, we used BIC to occupy the sGC heme and block the binding of NO. Any observed effect of NO on the BIC-bound enzyme would thus be independent of heme-NO complex formation. We first ensured that NO was not able to displace BIC at the heme (Fig. 6A) by monitoring the electronic absorption spectrum after NO was added to the preformed sGC-BIC complex. Interestingly, the absorbance maximum of the sGC-BIC complex did shift from 429 to 432 nm in the presence of NO. This change may be due to a conformational change at the heme pocket upon NO binding. However, the absence of a 399 nm peak in the electronic absorption spectrum indicates that NO was not binding at the heme iron, an observation supported by the absence of any Fe-NO signal in electron paramagnetic spectroscopy experiments. We then compared the activities of the sGC-BIC species in the absence and presence of excess NO, finding that the presence of NO increased the activity of the sGC-BIC complex from 6- to 94-fold (Fig. 6B). Thus, excess NO increases the activity of the sGC-BIC complex without formation of a sGC heme-NO complex. The effect of removing excess NO on the electronic absorption spectra and activity of the sGC-BIC complexes was investigated by adding dithionite, which rapidly destroys NO but does not react with alkyl isocyanides, to the samples. The spectrum of the sGC-BIC complex in the absence or presence of NO was not affected by dithionite or desalting into a NO-free buffer (data not shown). However, the activity of the sGC-BIC complex decreased significantly (35-fold) upon removal of excess NO, despite the absence of a spectroscopic change. These data confirm that the presence of excess NO activates the sGC heme-BIC complex without formation of a heme-NO complex, and demonstrate that removal of this activating NO results in a decrease in activity without any change in the heme spectrum. To further confirm these observations BIC was used to displace NO bound at the heme. Electronic absorption spectroscopy shows that excess BIC displaces NO from the sGC heme (Fig. 7A). If BIC can replace heme-bound NO but not affect non-heme NO interaction(s), an increase in the activity of the sGC-BIC complex is expected. In agreement with this prediction, the sGC-BIC complex made by displacing NO was activated 30-45-fold, whereas the sGC-BIC complex made in the absence of NO was activated 2-4-fold (Fig. 7B). A schematic of this NO-induced activation is shown in Fig. 8A. The activity of the sGC-BIC complex in the presence of YC-1 or NO was 24-26% of full activity. A similar conformational change in the sGC-BIC complex may be induced upon YC-1 and NO binding, as they lead to similar changes in activation (Fig. 8). Whereas the heme is not required for basal activity, it is critical for NO-induced activation and YC-1 synergism. Heme-free sGC is not activated by NO (32Wedel B. Humbert P. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Malkewitz J. Bohme E. Schultz G. Koesling D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2592-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), suggesting the heme cofactor is essential for non-heme NO activation. Non-heme NO might increase sGC activity by binding to either the α1 or β1 subunits and, combined with changes induced by the binding of NO at the heme iron, could lead to additional conformational changes in the heme domain or in the catalytic domains. However, the molecular details of this aspect of sGC activation may remain unresolved until the elucidation of the structure. The nature of the non-heme NO binding site is unknown. Proteins can bind NO through coordination to metals, in hydrophobic gas-binding pockets, or via reactive cysteine residues. However, the heme iron is the only metal associated with purified sGC, and CO is unable to activate the sGC-NO or sGC-BIC complexes. These observations suggest NO is not binding to a non-heme metal or in a hydrophobic gas-binding pocket. Cysteines are known to be critical for sGC activation (33Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8433-8443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Friebe A. Wedel B. Harteneck C. Foerster J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and while this article was in review, it was demonstrated that several sGC cysteines are S-nitrosated in the presence of low levels of NO (35Sayed N. Baskaran P. Ma X. van den Akker F. Beuve A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 12312-12317Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These results indicate that sGC cysteines are accessible for binding NO, raising the intriguing question of whether one or more of these cysteines might be involved in the mechanism of non-heme NO activation of sGC. In summary, the increase in sGC activity with addition of NO, despite BIC occupation of the heme, is further evidence for non-heme NO activation of sGC. This work establishes that BIC is a useful ligand to study this non-heme NO activation. Further experiments with advanced EPR and x-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopies, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, may reveal the nature of this non-heme NO binding site.

A genetic link between a common isoform of apoE, apoE4, and the incidence of late onset Alzheimer disease has drawn considerable attention to the potential roles of apoE in amyloid-related disease. We examined the interactions of apoE with amyloid fibrils composed of apoC-II and the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Aggregates of apoE with Aβ and apoC-II are found in Alzheimer and atherosclerotic plaques, respectively. Sedimentation velocity and fibril size distribution analysis showed that apoE3 and E4 isoforms bind and noncovalently cross-link apoC-II fibrils in a similar manner. This ability to cross-link apoC-II fibrils was abolished by the dissociation of the apoE tetramer to monomers or by thrombin cleavage to yield separate N- and C-terminal domains. Preparative ultracentrifuge binding studies indicated that apoE and the isolated N- and C-terminal domains of apoE bind with submicromolar affinities to both apoC-II and Aβ fibrils. Fluorescence quenching and resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed that both domains of apoE interact with apoC-II fibrils and demonstrated that the binding of the isolated N-terminal domain of apoE to apoC-II or Aβ fibrils is accompanied by a significant conformational change with helix three of the domain moving relative to helix one.

Interest in the role of apoE in amyloid diseases has arisen from the link between the apoE4 isoform and the occurrence of Alzheimer disease, with APOE4 conveying a higher risk and earlier age of onset of Alzheimer disease than APOE3 (5Corder E.H.

The three major isoforms of apoE differ by single arginine/cysteine substitutions at two positions. ApoE3 (112C/158R) is the most common isoform, whereas apoE4 (112R/158R) is the second most common isoform (6Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

There is currently no clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms of isoform-specific differences of apoE and how they are related to Alzheimer disease risk. Although recent studies suggest that apoE may form amyloid fibrils directly (7Hatters D.M. Zhong N. Rutenber E. Weisgraber K.H. J. Mol.

These results suggest that nonfibrillar components, such as SAP and apoE, may act as mediators of amyloid fibril deposition and stability. However, structural details of the interaction between these nonfibrillar components and amyloid fibrils are lacking.Here we use apoC-II fibrils as a model system to explore the structural requirements for apoE binding and cross-linking of amyloid fibrils. These studies reveal that binding and cross-linking of amyloid fibrils is reliant upon independent interaction sites in the N- and C-terminal domains of apoE and provide insight into the nature of the recognition of amyloid fibrils by these binding sites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The pET32a expression vectors for apoE3, apoE4, apoE3 N-terminal domain, apoE C-terminal domain, apoE4S53C, apoE4S76C, apoE4A241C, apoE4S263C, and apoE4T289C were kindly provided by Karl Weisgraber and Danny Hatters (Gladstone Institute, San Francisco) (22Hatters D.M.

Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36758-36765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ApoC-II was expressed and purified as described previously (27Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H. Howlett G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ApoC-IIW26F was provided by Chi Pham and Chai-Lean Teoh (University of Melbourne). Aβ-(1–40) was purchased from W. M. Keck Facility, Yale University (New Haven CT).Thrombin-cleaved apoE was prepared by incubation of apoE3 (0.4 mg/ml) in the presence of 2 units/ml thrombin (GE Healthcare) for 16 h at 37 °C. Thrombin-cleaved apoE was subjected to SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose the membrane was probed with polyclonal goat anti-apoE IgG primary antibody (Chemicon) and rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Chemicon). Horseradish peroxidase was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare).Amyloid Fibril Formation—ApoC-II or apoC-IIW26F amyloid fibrils were formed by rapid dilution of stock apoC-II or apoC-IIW26F (0.05 g/ml in 5 m guanidine-HCl) into 20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), followed by incubation at 20 °C. ApoC-II fibrils formed at 1 mg/ml were incubated for greater than 2 days, whereas apoC-II fibrils formed at 0.4 mg/ml were incubated for greater than 7 days. ApoC-II fibrils prepared by this method are referred to as “preformed.”Aβ-(1–40) fibrils were formed essentially as described previously (33Stratman N.C. Castle C.K. Taylor B.M. Epps D.E.

A 1 mm stock solution of Aβ-(1–40) peptide in 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid was diluted into TBS to a final concentration of 50 μm and incubated for 7 days at 37 °C with continuous shaking. Aβ-(1–40) fibrils prepared by this method are referred to as preformed.Sedimentation Velocity Analysis—ApoC-II fibrils (preformed at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml) were incubated in the presence or absence of test compounds for 2 h at room temperature and then were subjected to sedimentation velocity analysis using an Optima™ XL-A ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) and quartz double sector cells, with scans taken at 6-min intervals in continuous mode with a step size of 0.002 cm. Sedimentation was performed at 20 °C, and absorbance data were collected at 280 nm. Sedimentation coefficients in the presence of 1.5 m NaCl were corrected for the effect of solvent density and viscosity, to obtain s20,w values (35Mok Y.F. Howlett G.J. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 199-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity data were fitted to a c(s) continuous size distribution model using SEDFIT (36Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar), assuming a worm-like chain model to relate sedimentation coefficient to molecular mass (30MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Data were fitted with time-independent noise, using second derivative regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.95 and a resolution of 100 with a log spaced sedimentation coefficient grid, a persistence length of 36 nm, a dehydrated cross-sectional area of 23 nm2, a monomer molecular weight of 8914 Da, a hydration of 0.4 g/g, and a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g (30MacRaild C.A.

J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Preparative Ultracentrifugation and Gel Electrophoresis—ApoC-II preformed fibrils were equilibrated with apoE3 (0.1 mg/ml) for 15 min in the presence or absence of 20 mm DHPC. Samples (150 μl) were centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (390,000 × g) for 15 min at 20 °C (TLA-100 rotor, Optima™ MAX, Beckman-Coulter) to sediment the apoC-II fibrils but not unbound apoE (35Mok Y.F. Howlett G.J. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 199-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Control experiments confirmed that apoE alone did not sediment under these conditions. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in the original volume of buffer. The original pre-centrifugation sample, supernatant fraction, and pellet fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.Binding Studies—ApoC-II fibrils were preformed at 112 μm, and Aβ-(1–40) fibrils were formed at 50 μm, and then both fibrils were diluted to a final concentration of 5 μm and incubated with different concentrations of apoE derivatives (0–9 μm) in the presence or absence of 20 mm DHPC in TBS with 2 mg/ml dextran, in a total volume of 200 μl. The presence of dextran provided density stabilization during centrifugation and avoided stirring effects upon braking. The samples were equilibrated for 15 min at 25 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm (390,000 × g) at 25 °C for 7 min (TLA-100 rotor, Optima™ MAX, Beckman-Coulter). Control experiments with fibrils or apoE alone confirmed that these conditions sediment apoC-II and Aβ-(1–40) fibrils but not unbound apoE (35Mok Y.F. Howlett G.J. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 413: 199-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). After centrifugation the top 150 μl of supernatant solution was removed for analysis of the unbound protein concentration. Unbound protein concentration was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Samples were read using a SPEX fluorolog τ-2. The sample was excited at 295 nm, and emission was collected at 350 nm. A standard curve was prepared using the appropriate ligand as the standard in the appropriate buffer. The concentration of unbound ligand was calculated and corrected for the presence of a small amount of free monomeric apoC-II or Aβ-(1–40) measured for control samples of apoC-II or Aβ-(1–40) fibrils in the absence of apoE. The free monomer concentration was determined to include <5% of the total apoC-II or Aβ-(1–40) concentration. SDS-PAGE was used to confirm that the unbound pools of Aβ and apoC-II were not effected by the addition of apoE. Samples were prepared in triplicate. Bound ligand concentrations were calculated by subtraction of the free ligand concentration from the total ligand concentration. The binding curves were fitted to a single site binding model as shown in Equation 1, [LR][R]0=n[L]KD+[L](Eq. 1) where [R]0 is the total receptor concentration; n is the binding capacity; [LR] is the bound ligand concentration; [L] is the free ligand concentration, and KD is the dissociation equilibrium constant.AEDANS Labeling—Cysteine containing apoE derivatives were all labeled with AEDANS as described previously (22Hatters D.M. Budamagunta M.S. Voss J.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34288-34295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The labeling efficiency was determined using absorbance at 280 and 337 nm and extinction coefficients for AEDANS of 6100 m-1cm-1 at 337 nm and 1060 m-1cm-1 at 280 nm, an extinction coefficient of 44,460 m-1cm-1 at 280 nm for full-length apoE variants, and an extinction coefficient of 27,960 m-1cm-1 at 280 nm for apoE3 N-terminal domain (37Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 38Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Labeling efficiency ranged from 60 to 100%, whereas the apoE3 N-terminal domain used in resonance energy transfer experiments was 100% labeled.Fluorescence Emission Spectra—The emission spectra of AEDANS-labeled derivatives were measured in the presence and absence of preformed apoC-II fibrils in TBS. The AEDANS probe was excited at 336 nm, and emission was collected between 400 and 600 nm. The emission spectra were corrected for the light-scattering contributions of apoC-II fibrils and the buffer alone.Acrylamide Quenching—AEDANS-labeled apoE derivatives in the presence and absence of preformed apoC-II fibrils were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of acrylamide (0–0.5 m) in TBS. Emission scans of these samples were taken. Stern-Volmer plots were constructed by plotting the fluorescence at the wavelength of the emission maximum, relative to the unquenched fluorescence emission maximum, as a function of acrylamide concentration. Data were fitted to the Stern-Volmer Equation 2, F0F=1+K[Q](Eq. 2) where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of the unquenched and quenched fluorophore; [Q] is the concentration of quencher, and K is the Stern-Volmer coefficient (39Lakowicz, J. R. (1999) in Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Lakowicz, J. R., ed) 2nd Ed., pp. 368-391, Kluwer Academic, New YorkGoogle Scholar).Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—The emission spectra of AEDANS-labeled and unlabeled apoE3 N-terminal domain was measured in the presence and absence of preformed apoC-II or Aβ-(1–40) fibrils in TBS. The tryptophan residues were excited at a wavelength of 295 nm, and emission was collected between 300 and 600 nm. The emission spectra were corrected for the light-scattering contributions of apoC-II or Aβ-(1–40) fibrils and buffer alone. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency (E) was calculated according to Equation 3, E=1−FDAFD(Eq. 3) where FDA is the fluorescence intensity of the molecule with the donor and acceptor attached, whereas FD is the fluorescence intensity of the molecule with only the donor fluorophore attached (39Lakowicz, J. R. (1999) in Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Lakowicz, J. R., ed) 2nd Ed., pp. 368-391, Kluwer Academic, New YorkGoogle Scholar). The FRET distance r was calculated according to Equation 4, E=R06R06+r6(Eq. 4) where R0 is the Förster radius (39Lakowicz, J. R. (1999) in Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (Lakowicz, J.

The sedimentation velocity data for preformed apoC-II fibrils in the presence and absence of apoE3 and apoE4 are presented in Fig. 1. The optical density profiles show that both apoE3 and apoE4 increase the sedimentation rate of apoC-II fibrils. We have shown previously that the increase in the average sedimentation coefficient of apoC-II fibrils induced by nonfibrillar components such as SAP and apoE is much greater than can be accounted for on the basis of the molecular weight of the bound component. Together with the results of rheological and electron microscopy analysis, the increase in the rate of sedimentations is attributed to a change in the network structure of the fibrils with increased cross-linking and condensation forming more localized fibrillar agg"
https://openalex.org/W2027572398,"The Syk protein-tyrosine kinase is an essential component of the signaling machinery that couples the B cell receptor for antigen to multiple downstream signal transduction pathways. Syk is phosphorylated and activated rapidly and transiently following receptor engagement, but many signaling events, such as the activation of transcription factors occur over the course of several minutes or hours. To investigate a role for the continued activation of Syk in these processes, we generated an analog-sensitive mutant with an engineered ATP-binding pocket to render the kinase uniquely sensitive to an orthogonal inhibitor. Mutation of the gatekeeper residue in Syk yielded an enzyme with very low activity. Second-site mutations, selected based on structural comparisons between Syk and Src, were introduced that restored catalytic activity to the mutant Syk. Syk-deficient DT40 B cells were prepared expressing the analog-sensitive Syk (Syk-AQL). Inhibition of the activity of Syk prior to, concomitant with or shortly following receptor engagement led to the rapid inhibition of receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and blocked the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, NF-κB, and NFAT. The receptor-mediated activation of NF-κB required active Syk for a relatively short period of time, whereas the activation of NFAT required active kinase for a prolonged (>1 h) period. Receptor cross-linking led to the recruitment of Syk to the clustered receptor. Retention of these receptor-kinase complexes on the cell surface was dependent on the continued activity of Syk. Thus, despite the apparent transient nature of the activation of Syk, the catalytic activity of the Syk was required for sustained signaling from ligated receptors.

Clark M.R. Signal Transduction. 2004; 4: 173-194Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Syk is then required for coupling the BCR to the phosphorylation and activation of the downstream regulatory and adaptor molecules BLNK/SLP65, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Btk, and phospholipase C-γ2, leading to the activation of Akt and protein kinase C, the mobilization of Ca2+, activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades, and activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and NFAT. The kinetics of these BCR-initiated signaling events are of considerable interest as their magnitude and duration are thought to be critical factors in determining B cell survival, development and proliferation. The phosphorylation on tyrosine of BCR components, Syk and Btk all occur rapidly following receptor engagement (2Irish J.M. Czerwinski D.K. Nolan G.P. Levy R. J.

Phosphorylation is important for the activity of Syk and Btk and for the retention of BCR-signaling complexes on the cell surface (5Hou P. Araujo E. Zhao T. Zhang M. Massenburg D. Veselits M. Doyle C. Dinner A.R. Clark M.R. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 1147-1158Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar); but these also are transient events. After immediate activation of membrane proximal signaling, there is a slower increase of negative signaling through phosphatases that had been transiently inhibited by BCR-stimulated increases in H2O2 (2Irish J.M. Czerwinski D.K. Nolan G.P. Levy R. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3Singh D.K. Kumar D. Siddiqui Z. Basu S.K. Kumar V. Rao K.V.S.

Cell. 2002; 10: 1057-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This dampens the wave of positive signaling and regulates the time and magnitude of the BCR response. However, other receptor-mediated responses are of longer duration. The phosphorylation of ERK, which also occurs rapidly following receptor engagement, is more sustained than the phosphorylation of Syk (2Irish J.M. Czerwinski D.K. Nolan G.P. Levy R. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The rapid, extensive release of calcium from intracellular stores that occurs following receptor engagement is followed by a prolonged phase of low level, extracellular calcium influx. These two phases of calcium mobilization are required for the activation of NF-κB and NFAT, respectively (7Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 308Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Prolonged receptor engagement is required for the induction of cell cycle arrest in immature WEHI-231 B cells (8Page D.M. Defranco A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), maintenance of B cell anergy (9Gauld S.B. Benschop R.J. Merrell K.T. Cambier J.C. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), proliferation and survival of activated B cells (10Donahue A.C. Fruman D.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5851-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and proliferation of certain B cell lymphomas (11Gururajan M. Jennings C.D. Bondada S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although Syk is phosphorylated and activated transiently following BCR engagement and is critical for the initiation of most BCR-mediated signaling events, it is not clear whether its prolonged activation is needed for sustained signaling. We sought a model system in which the activity of Syk could be unambiguously silenced as a function of time following BCR cross-linking. For such an approach, inhibitors can be used to limit the activity of a particular kinase. However, there are often limitations regarding the specificity and selectivity of small molecule inhibitors. Conventional gene knock-out or silencing approaches do not lend themselves to an analysis of events occurring over a short time-scale. We sought instead to use a chemical genetic approach by developing an engineered form of Syk with an expanded ATP-binding site uniquely sensitive to a PP1-derived inhibitor bearing a bulky side chain (12Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M.

Soc. 1999; 121: 627-631Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). With this approach, the activity of Syk could be specifically blocked without affecting the activities of other kinases in the cell. We found, however, that the conventional mutagenesis strategy employed for the development of an “analog-sensitive” Syk kinase resulted in a loss of catalytic activity necessitating the development of a second-site suppressor strategy for the generation of an active enzyme. Using this engineered kinase, we found that the receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine, the activation of ERK, and the presence of active BCR-signaling complexes at the plasma membrane were rapidly reversed upon inhibition of Syk. Although the activation of NF-κB required a relatively short period of Syk activity, the activation of NFAT required its prolonged activation. Thus, despite the apparent transient nature of Syk activation, its activity is actually critical for continued signaling from liganded BCR complexes.

The antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-pERK from Cell Signaling Technologies, and anti-Syk (N19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cells, Transfections, and Stable Cell Lines—Chicken DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Syk-deficient DT40 cells (14Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) were transfected by electroporation (300 V, 330 μF) using a Cell-Porator (Invitrogen). Cells were co-transfected with the plasmid, pBabe-puro, and selected in media containing 0.5 μg/ml puromycin to establish stable cell lines. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis and fluorescence microscopy. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Plasmids coding for Myc epitope-tagged Syk(M442A) or Syk(M442G) were generated with the ExSite™ PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) using, as a template, the pCMV-Myc-Syk plasmid. Plasmids coding for Myc-tagged Syk(R428Q/M429L/M442A) (referred to here as Syk-AQL) or Syk(R428Q/M429L/M442G) (Syk-GQL) were also constructed using this PCR-based strategy from the corresponding Syk(M442A) or Syk(M442G) expression vectors. The coding sequence for Syk-AQL was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pEGFP-N2 plasmid (BD Biosciences/Clontech) to generate the Syk-AQL-EGFP expression vector. Cellular Activation Assays—For measurement of the activation of NF-κB or NFAT, Syk-deficient DT40 cells were co-transfected with 20 μg of the indicated Syk expression plasmid or empty vector and 2 μg of an NF-κB- or NFAT-driven luciferase reporter plasmid. Alternatively, DT40 cell lines stably expressing Syk or a mutant form of Syk were transfected with the reporter plasmid alone. Cells were stimulated by varying concentrations of goat anti-chicken IgM antibody (Bethyl) or with a mixture of PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 μm) at 37 °C for 6 h. For some experiments, cells were treated at various times before or following receptor ligation with 1-Na-PP1, 1-NM-PP1, 2-NM-PP1, or with the carrier solvent Me2SO alone. Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates using the luciferase assay system kit (Promega). For the analysis of protein expression or phosphorylation, DT40 cells were treated with or without anti-IgM in the presence or absence of PP1 derivatives for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C and then lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 2mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 625 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins in supernatants collected following centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and analyzed by Western blotting with antiphosphotyrosine, anti-Syk, and/or anti-pERK antibodies. In Vitro Kinase Assay—DT40 cells were collected and lysed as described above. A 10-μl aliquot of each lysate was assayed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μm ATP, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and as a substrate, 3 μg of either cdb3 or tubulin for 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by heating in SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Protein bands corresponding to cdb3 or tubulin were excised and analyzed by scintillation spectrometry. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—DT40 cells expressing EGFP-tagged proteins were collected, washed twice with and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and stimulated at 37 °C for the indicated times with 10 μg/ml of anti-chicken IgM antibody conjugated with Texas Red. Cells were fixed in 1 ml of 10% formaldehyde in PBS and transferred to polylysine-coated coverslips for microscopic examination. To measure receptor internalization, cells were stimulated at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml of anti-chicken IgM antibody for 30 min. 1NM-PP1 (5 μm) or Me2SO carrier was added to the cells 5 min after treatment with anti-IgM antibody. Cells on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were fixed for 15 min by adding 3.7% formaldehyde solution. Cells were permeabilized by incubation for 15 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS or were treated only with PBS in the case of nonpermeabilized cells. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1 μg/ml of donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). Cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using NIH image J software. Establishing an Analog-sensitive Form of Syk—A reduction in the size of the “gatekeeper” residue in the ATP-binding site of protein kinases allows access to an additional binding pocket that can be occupied by nucleotides or inhibitors bearing bulky substituents (12Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M.

Soc. 1999; 121: 627-631Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Through sequence alignments, we identified the gatekeeper residue in Syk as Met-442 and then prepared site-directed mutagenesis plasmids for the expression of forms of Syk in which methionine was replaced by a smaller glycine or alanine residue. The plasmids expressing wild-type Syk, Syk(M442G), or Syk(M442A) were transiently transfected into Syk-deficient DT40 cells along with an NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid to assess the signaling capabilities of the two mutants. Syk(M442G) was largely unable to restore BCR-stimulated signaling to the Syk-deficient cells despite a level of expression equivalent to that of the wild-type kinase (Fig. 1A). However, Syk(M442A) exhibited a partial ability to restore signaling to the Syk-deficient cells (Fig. 1B). To determine whether this level of activity would be sufficient for further analyses of receptor-mediated signaling, we established stable DT40 cell lines expressing either wild-type Syk or the engineered Syk mutant. Cells stably expressing Syk(M442G) were unable to couple BCR engagement to the activation of NF-κB (Fig. 1C). In this system, Syk(M442A) also restored a low level of BCR-stimulated NF-κB activity similar to that observed in the transiently transfected cells (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the BCR-stimulated phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine was defective in cells expressing Syk(M442A) as compared with wild-type Syk and was more comparable with the pattern observed in Syk-deficient cells (Fig. 1E). The defective signaling observed in cells expressing Syk(M442G) or Syk(M442A) was likely because of a substantial decrease in their catalytic activities as lysates of cells expressing either enzyme demonstrated very low activity in an in vitro kinase assay using cdb3 as an exogenous substrate as compared with lysates from cells expressing the wild-type kinase (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that the mutation of Met-442 to a smaller amino acid residue largely abrogates the catalytic activity of Syk. Development of Second-site Suppressor Mutations to Recover the Catalytic Activity of an Analog-sensitive Form of Syk—Although the single-site mutation strategy for the generation of an analog-sensitive kinase has been successful for many enzymes, some kinases are inactivated or become unstable when the gatekeeper residue is mutated. In these cases, additional mutations often can be made to restore activity to the modified kinases (15Zhang C. Kenski D.M. Paulson J.L. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Shokat K.M. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The loss of activity in Syk(M442A) or Syk(M442G) mutants suggests destabilization of the N-lobe structure. To identify second-site suppressor mutations that would restore catalytic activity to either the Syk(M442A) or Syk(M442G) mutant, we compared the three-dimensional structures of the catalytic domains of Syk and Src. Src was chosen because the structure of the catalytic domain is very similar to that of Syk, and mutation of the gatekeeper residue of Src yields an active, analog-sensitive kinase (12Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). We compared the amino acid residues interacting with the gatekeeper residues in both ATP-binding sites (Fig. 2A). In the active Src kinase crystal structure (16Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), Leu-325 is within 5 Å of Thr-338 and points toward the pocket close to Thr-338. The side chain of Gln-324 is within 8 Å of Thr-338. In the Syk kinase crystal structure (17Atwell S. Adams J.M. Badger J. Buchanan M.D. Feil I.K. Froning K.J. Gao X. Hendle J. Keegan K. Leon B.C. Muller-Dieckmann H.J. Nienaber V.L. Noland B.W. Post K. Rajashankar K.R. Ramos A. Russell M. Burley S.K. Buchanan S.G. J. Biol.

In addition to their proximity to Thr-338/Met-442, these residues are close to the C-terminal end of the important alpha helix C and may be involved in stabilizing the N-lobe structure. To determine whether we could improve the stability of the Syk gatekeeper mutants, we replaced the codons for Arg-428 and Met-429 with sequences coding for glutamine and leucine, respectively, to generate plasmids coding for Syk(R428Q/M429L/M442A) (Syk-AQL) and Syk(R428Q/M429L/M442G) (Syk-GQL).FIGURE 2Activities of the Syk-AQL and Syk-GQL mutants.A, The gatekeeper residues in Syk and Src are shown in green.

B, constructs expressing wild-type Syk (♦, WT Syk), Syk-AQL (▪), Syk-GQL (▴), or an empty vector (○, Syk-/-) was transiently transfected into Syk-deficient DT40 cells along with a NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid, activated with anti-IgM antibodies, and analyzed for luciferase expression as described in the legend to Fig. 1, panel A. C, Syk-deficient DT40 cells (○, Syk-/-), or DT40 cells stably expressing wild-type Syk (♦, WT Syk), Syk-AQL (▪), or Syk-GQL (▴) were transfected with a NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid, activated with anti-IgM antibodies, and analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 1, panel A. Lysates from cells expressing wild-type Syk (WT), Syk-AQL (AQL), or Syk-GQL (GQL) were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-Syk antibody (inset).

Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against phosphotyrosine (pTyr), Syk (Syk), or GAPDH. The migration positions of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) are indicated.

Interestingly, Syk-AQL was able to signal in Syk-deficient cells as efficiently as wild-type Syk (Fig. 2B). The activity of Syk-GQL was somewhat improved from that of Syk(M442G), but was still relatively low (Fig. 2B). Cell lines stably transfected to express Syk-AQL were generated for further analyses. BCR-stimulated NF-κB activity was restored in cells expressing Syk-AQL to the levels observed in cells containing wild-type Syk (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the extent of receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing Syk-AQL was comparable with that of cells expressing the wild-type kinase (Fig. 2D). Cells stably expressing Syk-GQL were unable to signal, most likely because of the lower level of expression of the mutant in stable cell lines as compared with transiently transfected cells. These results indicate that the substitution of glutamine for Arg-428 and leucine for Met-429 within the ATP-binding site can restore activity to a Syk(M442A) mutant. Sensitivity of Syk-AQL to Engineered PP1 Derivatives—To be useful, the engineered kinase needs to exhibit the desired selective sensitivity to bulky, PP1-derived inhibitors. To test this, we incubated cells expressing wild-type Syk or Syk-AQL with varying concentrations of 1Na-PP1, 1NM-PP1, 2NM-PP1, or Me2SO carrier for 15 min prior to the addition of anti-IgM antibody. The activation of NF-κB was assessed using the NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter assay. 1Na-PP1 and 1NM-PP1 both inhibited the ability of Syk-AQL to couple the BCR to the activation of NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner, but neither affected signaling in cells expressing wild-type Syk (Fig. 3, A and B). Neither kinase was inhibited by 2NM-PP1 (Fig. 3C), illustrating the specificity of the kinase-inhibitor interaction. Investigations of the Kinetics of BCR Signaling—Many of the antigen receptor-mediated phosphorylation that occur following BCR cross-linking are dependent on the expression of a functional Syk kinase. To examine the effects of the specific inhibition of Syk on BCR signaling to protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, we treated cells expressing Syk-AQL or wild-type Syk with 1NM-PP1 either 5 min prior to or simultaneously with the addition of activating anti-IgM antibodies. After 5 min of activation, cells were harvested and analyzed for content of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by Western blotting. Treatment with 1NM-PP1 dramatically reduced the level of phosphorylation both in the pretreated cells and in cells in which 1NM-PP1 and an anti-IgM antibody were added simultaneously (Fig. 4A). The inhibitor had little effect on tyrosine phosphorylation in cells expressing wild-type Syk. Similar results were observed if 1Na-PP1 was substituted for 1NM-PP1 (data not shown). These data indicate that the inhibitor can penetrate cells quickly to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Syk-AQL after anti-IgM stimulation. Because Syk is phosphorylated rapidly and transiently following receptor aggregation, we were interested in determining if the continued activity of Syk was necessary to sustain the phosphorylation of downstream substrates. To investigate this, we treated Syk-AQL-expressing cells with or without 1NM-PP1 at various times prior to or following BCR engagement and examined the profile of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by Western blotting. When cells were treated with inhibitor 1 min prior to the addition of anti-IgM, receptor-stimulated protein-tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked when analyzed at 5, 10, or 15 min after activation (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, addition of the inhibitor even at 5 or 10 min following receptor engagement resulted in a rapid reduction of global protein-tyrosine phosphorylation to near basal levels. Thus, the continued activity of Syk is required for maintaining the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of essentially all of the readily detectable substrates that are modified following BCR engagement. To determine whether the continued activity of Syk was required for the prolonged activation of ERK, the membrane from the above experiment was stripped and reprobed with anti-pERK antibodies. The inhibition of Syk-AQL resulted in a loss of ERK phosphorylation regardless of the time of addition of the inhibitor (Fig. 4B). Coupling the BCR to the Regulation of Transcription Factors—We were interested in examining the relationship between the duration of the activation of Syk and the kinetics of NF-κB- or NFAT-induced gene expression because of their different responses to changes in the magnitude and period of calcium fluxes. Cells expressing Syk-AQL were transfected with either an NF-κB- or an NFAT-driven luciferase plasmid and were treated with 1NM-PP1 at different time points following stimulation with anti-IgM. The level of luciferase was measured 6 h later. The inhibition of Syk immediately following receptor engagement decreased the extent to which NF-κB was activated (Fig. 5A). However, a substantial recovery of NF-κB activity was observed when the inhibitor was added 30 min or longer following stimulation, suggesting that a relatively short-term activation of Syk was enough to induce the activation of NF-κB. The inhibition of Syk-AQL also blocked the receptor-mediated activation of NFAT. Interestingly, however, the activation of NFAT was blocked even when the inhibitor was added 1 h after the initial stimulation (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that the full activation of NFAT requires that Syk be continuously active for a prolonged period of time following BCR stimulation. Recruitment of Syk-AQL to the Antigen Receptor—To monitor the interactions of Syk-AQL with the antigen receptor, we generated an expression vector coding for Syk-AQL fused at the C terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein (Syk-AQL-EGFP). A Syk-deficient cell line stably expressing Syk-AQL-EGFP was generated. Antigen receptors were engaged using an anti-IgM antibody conjugated with Texas Red, and the localization of both the BCR and Syk-AQL-EGFP were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Ten minutes following addition of anti-IgM antibody, the cross-linked BCR complex formed a cap at one pole of the cell that co-localized with Syk-AQL-EGFP (Fig. 6A), indicating that Syk-AQL-EGFP could be recruited normally to the clustered BCR. Similar results were seen 6 min following receptor aggregation (not shown). After 30 min of stimulation, a fraction of the clustered BCR complexes are internalized, whereas others are retained at the cell surface (18Ma H. Yankee T.M. Hu J. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, clusters of surface IgM in association with the kinase were readily visible at the plasma membrane of cells expressing Syk-AQL-EGFP that had been treated with anti-IgM antibody for 30 min in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 6B). However, the addition of 1NM-PP1 to cells with preformed caps enhanced the internalization of receptor complexes and decreased the retention of BCR-Syk complexes at the membrane (Fig. 6B). The internalized receptors were not associated with Syk-AQL-EGFP, whereas those at the membrane retained the interaction. To confirm changes in receptor location, we stimulated cells expressing Syk-AQL-EGFP as above, but using unlabeled anti-IgM antibodies. The resulting anti-IgM-BCR complexes were then detected in either detergent-permeabilized or intact, nonpermeabilized cells using a labeled secondary antibody. The treatment of cells with 1NM-PP1 resulted in a substantial decrease in the level of cell surface receptor with a corresponding increase in the level of internalized receptor (Fig. 6C). In this study, we describe a chemical genetic approach to the study of Syk and its role in BCR signaling. Shokat and co-workers (19Bishop A.C. Shah K. Liu Y. Witucki L. Kung C. Shokat K.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) have shown that mutations can be made to expand the ATP-binding sites of kinases to engineer in a sensitivity to inhibitors specifically designed to occupy the newly enlarged binding pocket. Although this strategy works for many kinases, an estimated 30% are destabilized by a reduction in size of the gatekeeper residue and are rendered largely inactive. We find that the activity of Syk also is greatly reduced by the substitution of the gatekeeper methionine with either glycine or alanine. A random mutagenesis approach has been described to identify second-site suppressor mutations that can be introduced into the β2, β3, and β5 strands of the N-lobe β sheet of the kinase domains of “intolerant” kinases to stabilize their structures and restore activity (15Zhang C. Kenski D.M. Paulson J.L. Bonshtien A. Sessa G. Cross J.V. Templeton D.J. Shokat K.M. Nat. Meth. 2005; 2: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Wild-type Syk, however, already contains the residues at these positions that would be expected to stabilize the N-lobe β sheet. Consequently, we sought an alternative approach to the generation of second-site suppressor mutations. In this approach, we focused on the amino acids in closest contact with the gatekeeper methionine in Syk reasoning that these might be the most affected by a gatekeeper mutation. We substituted two of these amino acids, Arg-428 and Met-429, with glutamine and leucine, respectively, based on the fact that Gln-324 and Leu-325 are found at the same relative positions in Src and are in close contact with the Src gatekeeper Thr-338. Moreover, Src is stable to mutagenesis of its gatekeeper residue (12Bishop A.C. Ubersax J.A. Petsch D.T. Matheos D.P. Gray N.S. Blethrow J. Shimizu E. Tsien J.Z. Schultz P.G. Rose M.D. Wood J.L. Morgan D.O. Shokat K.M. Nature. 2000; 407: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that this approach is successful for restoring catalytic function to a Syk(M442A), but not a Syk(M442G) gatekeeper mutant. The resulting kinase, designated Syk-AQL, is effectively recruited to the aggregated BCR complex and restores signaling from the receptor to the activation of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, ERK, NFAT, and NF-κB to an extent similar to that of the wild-type kinase, indicating that the mutation does not disrupt the normal biological function of the enzyme. The engineered kinase also retains its selective sensitivity to the bulky PP1 derivatives, 1NM-PP1 and 1Na-PP1, indicating that the additional mutations do not reduce the size of the enlarged binding pocket. The engineered kinase can also discriminate between different isomers of the inhibitor, as 2NM-PP1 does not affect the activity of Syk-AQL. Thus, this strategy provides a new tool to aid in the development of active, analog-sensitive kinases in cases where the gatekeeper mutation compromises the activity of the enzyme. Chemical genetic approaches are well suited to the study of dynamic processes that cannot be studied by conventional knock-out or knock-down strategies. Our examination of the roles of Syk in propagating signals from the BCR was aided by the availability of Syk-deficient cells with signaling restored by the expression of either the engineered kinase or the wild-type enzyme. Signaling from the antigen receptor to the phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine and the activation of ERK, NF-κB, and NFAT are all inhibited by 1NM-PP1 in cells expressing Syk-AQL, but not in cells expressing wild-type Syk, indicating that the effects of the inhibitor are confined to the inhibition of the engineered kinase. Inhibition of Syk-AQL activity prior to receptor engagement blocks mostly all receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. A similar effect is seen if the inhibitor is added simultaneously with the activating antibody, suggesting that cells are highly permeable to 1NM-PP1 and that inhibition is rapid. It is interesting to note, however, that addition of inhibitor at various times after receptor engagement also leads to a substantial loss of tyrosine phosphorylation to the point where levels are nearly as low as those observed in inhibitor-pretreated cells. This is most certainly because of the actions of protein-tyrosine phosphatases that rapidly dephosphorylate proteins once the activity of Syk is terminated. Thus, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation that is observed following receptor engagement represents a dynamic balance between protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Despite the fact that additional tyrosine kinases such as Btk and Lyn are activated following receptor aggregation, the continued activity of Syk is essential for maintaining the level of tyrosine phosphorylation at detectable levels in anti-IgM-stimulated cells. The BCR-dependent activation of ERK, as measured by its phosphorylation, is more prolonged than the phosphorylation and activation of Syk, suggesting the additional contribution of BCR-dependent, but Syk-independent, regulatory mechanisms (2Irish J.M. Czerwinski D.K. Nolan G.P. Levy R. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Irish J.M. Czerwinski D.K. Nolan G.P. Levy R. Blood. 2006; 108: 3135-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite this difference in activation kinetics, our data indicate that the continued activity of Syk is, in fact, required for maintaining ERK in its activated state as the inhibition of Syk-AQL at varying times following BCR engagement decreases the amount of phosphorylated, activated ERK to basal levels. BCR clustering eventually leads to the activation of transcription factors and changes in gene expression that determine the final physiological outcome of receptor engagement. Two important transcription factors that are activated through the BCR are NF-κB and NFAT. The activation of both are inhibited by the preincubation of Syk-AQL-expressing cells with 1NM-PP1 reflecting the need for a functional Syk kinase to initiate the signaling cascades leading to their stimulation. However, the length of time that Syk needs to be active following receptor engagement is markedly different for regulation of the two factors. Substantial activation of NF-κB requires Syk to remain active for a relatively short period of time following BCR ligation. This likely reflects the fact that NF-κB is activated following an immediate and pronounced increase in intracellular Ca2+ (7Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 388: 308Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), an event that is known to be regulated by Syk (21Fluckiger A.C. Li Z.M. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In contrast, the activation of NFAT, which requires a prolonged residual Ca2+ flux, also requires a prolonged period of time, in excess of 1 h, during which Syk must remain active. Thus, despite the apparent rapid and transient nature of the phosphorylation of Syk and activation following receptor engagement, its activity is still required for an extended period of time for the effective activation of NFAT. Because prolonged Ca2+ influx in B cells is regulated by Btk (21Fluckiger A.C. Li Z.M. Kato R.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the continued activity of Syk is necessary for maintaining the required level of activity of Btk needed to regulate this process. Interactions of the BCR with polyvalent antigens or anti-receptor antibodies lead both to the generation of downstream signals and the internalization of receptor-ligand complexes. Aggregated receptors form clustered patches on the cell surface, which then migrate to a single pole of the cell to form a cap where most are internalized. The extent of capping varies between B cell lines but is quite pronounced in DT40 cells and is enhanced by the expression of Syk (18Ma H. Yankee T.M. Hu J. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Syk-AQL-EGFP, like Syk-EGFP (18Ma H. Yankee T.M. Hu J. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) is associated with the capped receptors but is not associated with the internalized receptors. A subset of the BCR/Syk-AQL-EGFP complexes that form at the plasma membrane is retained for at least 30 min following receptor engagement. This is consistent with our previous studies on BCR-Syk interactions in cells expressing Syk-EGFP, which demonstrated the persistence of small clusters or patches of receptor-associated Syk on the cell surface for periods of time in excess of 1 h and after most receptors have been internalized (18Ma H. Yankee T.M. Hu J. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An interesting recent study has shown that receptor complexes that are active for signaling remain on the cell surface because of their phosphorylation on the same tyrosine residues that also mediate signaling; the internalized receptors are not phosphorylated (5Hou P. Araujo E. Zhao T. Zhang M. Massenburg D. Veselits M. Doyle C. Dinner A.R. Clark M.R. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 1147-1158Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that these Syk-AQL-EGFP-containing BCR complexes are retained because of receptor phosphorylation. It has been proposed that Syk, associated with phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), is active to phosphorylate neighboring BCR complexes to amplify signals initiated by BCR engagement (5Hou P. Araujo E. Zhao T. Zhang M. Massenburg D. Veselits M. Doyle C. Dinner A.R. Clark M.R. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: 1147-1158Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An analogous process may also allow the long-term, dynamic turnover of phosphate on the cytoplasmic chains of the clustered BCR complexes that contain active Syk to maintain these at the plasma membrane. Consequently, the subsequent treatment of anti-IgM-activated cells with 1NM-PP1, which leads to the enhanced internalization of antigen receptors, is most likely because of receptor dephosphorylation in the absence of active Syk. These dephosphorylated, internalized receptors lack associated Syk. These observations suggest that prolonged BCR-dependent signaling can continue from cell surface receptors that are clustered and contain the catalytically active Syk, which is needed to maintain the phosphorylation required to retain them at the cell surface."

Subunit closure is achieved by a ∼30° rigid body domain rotation, which completes the active site by integration of substrate binding residues that belong to the dimerization domain of the same or the partner subunit.

We determined the crystal structures of wild-type β-alanine synthase in complex with the reaction product β-alanine, and of the mutant E159A with the substrate N-carbamyl-β-alanine, revealing the closed state of a dimeric AcyI/M20 metallopeptidase-like enzyme. Subunit closure is achieved by a ∼30° rigid body domain rotation, which completes the active site by integration of substrate binding residues that belong to the dimerization domain of the same or the partner subunit. Substrate binding is achieved via a salt bridge, a number of hydrogen bonds, and coordination to one of the zinc ions of the di-metal center. β-Alanine synthase (βAS, 2The abbreviations used are: βAS, β-alanine synthase; SkβAS, S. kluyveri β-alanine synthase; AcyI, aminoacylase 1; PepV, peptidase V from L. delbrueckii; NCβA, N-carbamyl-β-alanine; βAla, β-alanine; WT, wild type; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. EC 3.5.1.6, also called β-ureido-propionase) catalyzes the third and final step of the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway in which N-carbamyl-β-alanine (NCβA) and N-carbamyl-β-amino isobutyrate are irreversibly hydrolyzed to β-alanine and β-amino isobutyrate, respectively (Scheme 1) (1Wasternack C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 8: 629-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The pyrimidine catabolic pathway is involved in the regulation of the cellular pyrimidine pool. It also represents the main clearance route for the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (2Heggie G.D. Sommadossi J.P. Cross D.S. Huster W.J. Diasio R.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2203-2206PubMed Google Scholar) and has considerable influence on its pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Furthermore, the degradation of uracil is the main endogenous source of β-alanine in mammals (3Traut T.W. Jones M.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 1-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This β-amino acid is structurally analogous to glycine and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) and exhibits neurotransmitter activity in the central nervous system (4Sandberg M. Jacobson I. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 1353-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). β-Alanine is also a building block of the dipeptidic anti-glycation agents carnosine and anserine, which have a putative role in protecting the central nervous system against diverse types of pathology (5Münch G.

Disorders in pyrimidine degradation and β-alanine metabolism in humans are normally associated with neurological disorders (8van Gennip A.H. Abeling N.G. Vreken P. van Kuilenburg A.B. J. Inherit.

Yeasts require β-alanine as a precursor of pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis, but generate it mostly via degradation of spermine (10White W.H. Gunyuzlu P.L. Toyn J.H. J. Biol.

Based on the comparison of primary structures and phylogenetic analyses they can be assigned to two subfamilies (15Gojković Z. Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of the eukaryotic βASs belong to one subfamily. βAS from the yeast Saccharomyces kluyveri (SkβAS, encoded by PYD3) shows negligible sequence similarity to this group but is related to bacterial N-carbamyl-l-amino acid amidohydrolases, hence forming a separate subfamily. Thus far, it is the only βAS whose crystal structure has been determined (16Lundgren S. Gojković Z. Piskur J. Dobritzsch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 51: 51851-51862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The subunit of the homodimeric enzyme consists of a catalytic and a dimerization domain. The active site is located in the domain interface and contains a di-zinc center exclusively bound by residues of the catalytic domain. Its coordination is characteristic for the metallopeptidase H clan of zinc peptidases (17Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The overall structure identifies SkβAS as a member of the aminoacylase-1/metallopeptidase 20 family (AcyI/M20) (18Biagini A. Puigserver A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Mol. Biol. 2001; 128: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which comprises proteins with diverse metabolic functions. Some of these proteins have therapeutic significance, such as human serum carnosinase, a promising drug target in the treatment of diabetes and homocarnosinosis (19Janssen B. Hohenadel D. Brinkkoetter P. Peters V. Rind N. Fischer C. Rychlik I. Cerna M. Romzova M. de Heer E. Baelde H. Bakker S.J. Zirie M. Rondeau E. Mathieson P. Saleem M.A. Meyer J. Koppel H. Sauerhoefer S.

Adamson P.C. Oncologist. 2006; 11: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Members of the AcyI/M20-family exist as either monomers or homodimers. In each of the crystal structures determined for homodimeric members the subunits display an extended open conformation (16Lundgren S. Gojković Z. Piskur J. Dobritzsch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 51: 51851-51862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Rowsell S. Pauptit R.A. Tucker A.D. Melton R.G. Blow D.M. Brick P.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For SkβAS, AcyI, and others, it has been suggested that a few residues from the dimerization domain participate in substrate binding and catalysis (16Lundgren S. Gojković Z. Piskur J. Dobritzsch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 51: 51851-51862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Lindner H.A. Lunin V.V. Alary A. Hecker R. Cygler M. Ménard R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 45: 44496-44504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because they do not approach the active site close enough in the crystal structures, it was proposed that conformational changes in form of domain movements are part of the catalytic cycle. The monomeric PepV from Lactobacillus delbrueckii is thus far the only member of the AcyI/M20 family for which the structure of a closed complex has been determined (24Jozic D. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Scholze H. Dive V. Henrich B. Huber R. Bode W. Maskos K. Structure. 2002; 10: 1097-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study we report the crystal structures of a SkβAS mutant complex with NCβA and of the wild-type enzyme in complex with β-alanine, which for the first time show the enzyme in the closed conformation and reveal the mode of substrate and product binding. Furthermore, we studied the role of specific active site residues for catalysis and substrate binding by site-directed mutagenesis. The crystal structures of some of the mutant enzymes were determined to analyze the structural effects of the amino acid exchanges. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Protein Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis of SkβAS was performed on the plasmid P491 carrying the S. kluyveri PYD3 gene followed by a fragment encoding the C-terminal His8 tag (15Gojković Z. Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The QuikChange XL Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce the desired mutations. Forward versions of the mutagenic primers are listed in supplemental Table S1, with the mutation site underlined. The sequences of the mutant SkβAS genes in the resulting transfer vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant SkβAS were recombinantly expressed and purified as described by Gojković et al. (15Gojković Z. Sandrini M.P.B. Piskur J. Genetics. 2001; 158: 999-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with only minor modifications of the purification protocol. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard (for crystallizations) or spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of 62340 m-1 cm-1 calculated with the ProtParam tool of the ExPASy proteomics server (for kinetic measurements). Enzyme Kinetics—The activity of wild-type and mutant SkβAS was determined in a radiochemical assay detecting the 14CO2 released from the substrate, basically following the procedure described by van Kuilenburg et al. (26van Kuilenburg A.B.P. van Lenthe H. van Gennip A.H. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 nm ZnCl2;NCβA concentrations were varied in the range of 1-100 mm. For the determination of the pH dependence of the SkβAS activity an NCβA concentration of 80 mm was used. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5-15 min at 25 °C. For each substrate concentration and enzyme sample, the reaction and measurement were performed three times. The data were fitted using the Michaelis-Menten equation. One unit of SkβAS catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of NCβA/min at 25 °C. Thermal Shift Assay—The thermal shift assays for SkβAS-WT and SkβAS-H226E and the analysis of the thermal shift data were performed as described by Ericsson et al. (27Ericsson U.B. Hallberg B.M. Detitta G.T. Dekker N. Nordlund P. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The thermal stability of both proteins was tested using the same buffer as for the radiochemical assay (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 nm ZnCl2) containing different concentrations of NaCl (0, 50, 100, 200 mm), in the absence or presence of 75 mm NCβA or β-alanine, respectively. This substrate/product concentration corresponds to the one used for the co-crystallizations resulting in SkβAS-ligand complexes. The protein concentration was 0.4 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection—To obtain the crystals for the datasets R322A and E159A 3Italics refer to datasets or crystal structures, normal font refer to mutant proteins or mutation sites. (and of the mutant E159D) the original crystallization conditions (28Dobritzsch D. Gojković Z. Andersen B. Piskur J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1267-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) were employed with only minor changes. For instance, for R322A, the original crystallization buffer was replaced by 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0 mixed with 50 mm Na-Hepes pH 7.0. Addition of potential ligands (R322A:20mm NCβA; E159A:50mm Gly-Gly-Gly; corresponding to active site/ligand molar ratios of 1:250 and 1:625, respectively) to the protein solution did not influence the crystallization behavior, and led only for R322A to appearance of electron density peaks confirming ligand binding. The drops consisted of 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution. The crystals appear after a 2-4-week equilibration at 20 °C and do not require cryoprotection. The conditions producing crystals for datasets E159A_NCβA and WT_βAla were identified in a subsequent round of sparse matrix and grid screening using commercially available formulations and nanodrop technology. Spherulites appeared almost immediately in some conditions of the polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000/LiCl grid screen after set-up of the 96-well sitting drop plates at 20 °C. These conditions were further optimized. The best crystals were obtained using vapor diffusion against 1 ml of reservoir solution containing 22-25% PEG 6000, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 50 mm Bicine, pH 9.0, and 1 m LiCl. The hanging drops consisted of 1 μl of protein solution (4-4.5 mg/ml SkβAS-E159A or -WT, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm NCβA or β-alanine, corresponding to an active site/ligand molar ratio of about 1:900) and 1 μl of reservoir solution, and were immediately after setup streak-seeded with seeds from previously obtained spherulites or crystals. Before data collection, the crystals were transferred into a 2-μl drop of cryo solution for about 5 s. The solution consisted of 1.3 μl of the respective reservoir solution, 0.6 μl glycerol (99%) and 0.1 μl of the respective ligand solution, ensuring the same final ligand concentration as used for the co-crystallization. All crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at diverse beam lines of the ESRF (Grenoble, France) (Table 1). The data sets WT_βAla and E159A_NCβA were processed and scaled with XDS (29Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3240) Google Scholar), the others were processed with MOSFLM and scaled with SCALA of the CCP4i suite of programs (30Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Analysis—The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (31Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) with the coordinates of ligand-free SkβAS (PDB-ID 1r43) as a search model. First, the positions of the dimer(s) of the dimerization domain were determined and fixed, while in the second step the coordinates of a single catalytic domain were used as search model. For data collected from crystals of the mutant E159D, the orientation and position of one catalytic domain per homodimer could not be determined, most likely because of too large variations in the interdomain angle between subunits related by crystallographic symmetry. Because the refinement of a model missing this domain resulted in a relatively poorly defined electron density map and non-satisfactory refinement statistics, these data were excluded from further analysis. Cycles of model building using WinCOOT (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23578) Google Scholar, 33Lohkamp, B., Emsley, P., and Cowtan, K. (2005) CCP4 Newsletter. 42, Contribution 7Google Scholar) and O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar) until crystallographic R-factor and Rfree converged. TLS groups were defined based on analyses using the TLSMD server (37Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Tight main chain and medium side chain NCS restraints were used throughout the refinement and only released for parts of the polypeptide chains, which showed clear structural differences between the subunits. NCβA or β-alanine were fitted into correspondingly shaped electron densities observed for R322A, E159A_NCβA, and WT_βAla, respectively. Water molecules were added using ARP/wARP implemented in the CCP4i suite of programs (30Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar) or manually in WinCOOT, and alternative conformations of amino acids were introduced and refined with appropriately split occupancies when the electron density maps indicated their presence. For E159A_NCβA and E159A, the electron density observed for one of the zinc ions (zinc 2) is too weak to represent a fully occupied zinc site. Because the distances to surrounding residues are shorter than the length of a hydrogen bond (<2.4 Å), replacement of the zinc by a water molecule could be excluded. Therefore, the refinement was carried out with the occupancy for zinc 2 set to 0.3. The composition and quality of the final models and further refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The model quality was determined using the program PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structural alignments were achieved with the programs TOP (39Lu G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 176-183Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and LSQKAB (40Kabsch W. Acta Cryst. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). Crystal, ligand, and monomer-monomer contacts were analyzed with CONTACT of the CCP4 suite of programs (30Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19793) Google Scholar) and the Protein-Protein Interaction server, respectively. Domain dynamics were analyzed using the DynDOM server (41Hayward S. Berendsen H.J.C. Proteins. 1998; 30: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), and cavities were calculated using the CASTp server (42Dundas J. Ouyang Z. Tseng J. Binkowski A. Turpaz Y. Liang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W116-W118Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Figs. 1, 2, b and c, and 3 and supplemental Fig. S2 were generated using PyMOL (43DeLano W.L.

The crystallographic data and structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with the accession codes 2v8v (R322A), 2v8d (E159A), 2v8h (E159A_NCβA), and 2v8g (WT_βAla).FIGURE 2Ligand binding to SkβAS. a, pH dependence of SkβAS activity determined using an NCβA concentration of 80 mm. b, stereoview of the active site of E159A_NCβA.

Gojković Z. Piskur J. Dobritzsch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 51: 51851-51862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Among them are the glutamate residue (Glu159) that is strictly conserved in AcyI/M20 family members and suggested to act as the catalytic base, His397, Gln229, and Gly396 putatively binding the substrate carbamyl group, as well as Arg322, His262, and Asn309 implicated in the binding of the carboxyl group. To test our hypotheses we produced six SkβAS mutants with single amino acid exchanges. Two of the three putative carboxyl group anchors were mutated to alanine (R322A, H262A), and Glu159 was exchanged with aspartate (E159D) or alanine (E159A). The metal-coordinating His226 was replaced by glutamate (H226E) to mimic the di-zinc center coordination observed in most members of the AcyI/M20-family, while His397 was mutated to an amino acid with an uncharged side chain of similar length (H397N). Expression of all mutant genes resulted in similar amounts of soluble protein as expression of the native gene. All mutants could be purified to a similar degree of homogeneity (supplemental Fig. S1). Using the original crystallization conditions diffraction-quality crystals were obtained for SkβAS-R322A, -E159A, and -E159D. The crystals of SkβAS-R322A belong to space group P1, with four subunits per asymmetric unit. SkβAS-E159A and -E159D crystallize in space group P21. The unit cell dimensions correspond to those previously observed for the selenomethionine-substituted protein, placing two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Cocrystallizations with NCβA, β-alanine, or potential ligands did not result in ligand binding to the active site. Another round of crystallization screens led to the identification of a novel condition at higher pH (8.75). Optimization of the condition yielded diffraction-quality crystals for SkβAS-WT and four of the mutants. All belong to space group P21 with consistent unit cell dimensions (Table 1) that do not correspond to those of crystals grown under the original condition. Because SkβAS-H226E failed to crystallize under both conditions, a thermal shift (Thermofluor) assay was performed to compare the thermal stabilities of this mutant and the native enzyme (supplemental Fig. S1b). It revealed that the low crystallization propensity of SkβAS-H226E is not caused by structural instability or incomplete folding, because the melting temperatures of mutant and wild-type enzyme are basically identical and the unfolding curves exhibit the same shape at all tested conditions. Overall Structure—As described previously, the subunit of SkβAS is composed of two domains (16Lundgren S. Gojković Z. Piskur J. Dobritzsch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 51: 51851-51862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The smaller domain (residues 247-365) consists of four β-strands (one of which is split) packed against two long α-helices and mediates most of the subunit contacts within the homodimer. This domain is inserted into the larger catalytic domain (residues 1-246, 366-455), which has a mixed three layer α/β/α-sandwich topology. The average root-mean-square distances (r.m.s.d.) for separate superposition of all catalytic and dimerization domains of the structures described here are ∼0.44 and 0.33 Å, respectively. There are only two noteworthy deviations between backbone coordinates. The deletion of the Arg322 side chain induces in one subunit per R322A dimer a shift of two amino acid stretches at the tip of the dimerization doma"

The newly synthesized sterols rapidly move to the plasma membrane (PM). The mechanism by which precursor sterols move back to the ER for their enzymatic processing to cholesterol is essentially unknown. Here we performed pulse-chase experiments and showed that the C29/C30 sterols rapidly move from the PM to the ER and are converted to cholesterol. The retrograde precursor sterol transport is largely independent of the Niemann-Pick type C proteins, which play important roles in late endosomal cholesterol transport. In contrast, disrupting lipid rafts significantly retards the conversion of C29/C30 and C28 sterols to cholesterol, causing the accumulation of precursor sterols at the PM. Our results reveal a previously undisclosed function of the PM lipid rafts: they bring cholesterol biosynthesis to completion by participating in the retrograde movement of precursor sterols back to the ER.

Our results reveal a previously undisclosed function of the PM lipid rafts: they bring cholesterol biosynthesis to completion by participating in the retrograde movement of precursor sterols back to the ER. Cholesterol is an important lipid component of biological membranes. It also serves as an obligatory precursor for the biosyntheses of steroid hormones, bile acids, and bioactive oxysterols (1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Ohgami N. Yamauchi Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In mammals, virtually every cell of the body is capable of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis involves successive enzymatic reactions, converting the simple, 2-carbon precursor acetyl-CoA into the 30-carbon, acyclic, apolar molecule squalene. The subsequent oxidation and cyclization of squalene yields the first sterol in the biosynthetic pathway, the 30-carbon (C30) lanosterol. The conversion of the C30 lanosterol to C27 cholesterol involves at least 18 enzymatic reactions (2Gurr M.I. Harwood J.L. Gurr M.I. Harwood J.L. Lipid Biochemistry. Chapman & Hall, New York1991: 297-337Google Scholar) and can proceed through two pathways, with one involving desmosterol as the final precursor, and the other involving lathosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol as the final precursors (Fig. 1). The biosynthetic enzymes responsible for converting squalene to cholesterol are all located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; fetal bovine serum, fetal-bovine serum; PM, plasma membrane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TLC, thin layer chromatography; NPC, Niemann-Pick type C; sterol regulatory element-binding protein, sterol regulatory element binding protein; sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein, sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage activating protein; GC-MS, gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; HCD, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; LE, endosome; LYS, lysosome; Hf, human fibroblast. 4The abbreviations used are: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; fetal bovine serum, fetal-bovine serum; PM, plasma membrane; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TLC, thin layer chromatography; NPC, Niemann-Pick type C; sterol regulatory element-binding protein, sterol regulatory element binding protein; sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein, sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage activating protein; GC-MS, gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; HCD, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin; MCD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; LE, endosome; LYS, lysosome; Hf, human fibroblast. membranes (2Gurr M.I. Harwood J.L. Gurr M.I. Harwood J.L. Lipid Biochemistry. Chapman & Hall, New York1991: 297-337Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that, in addition to synthesizing cholesterol, mammalian cells also synthesize substantial amounts of precursor sterols (3Echevarria F. Norton R.A. Nes W.D. Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8484-8489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to cholesterol, the precursor sterols leave the ER and rapidly reach the plasma membrane (PM) within 30-min time (5Heino S. Lusa S. Somerharju P. Ehnholm C. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6Kaplan M.R. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The precursor sterols at the PM are predicted to move back to the ER to be enzymatically processed to cholesterol. This retrograde movement is an essential step to complete cholesterol biosynthesis. Little is known about the mechanism(s) of retrograde movement of sterols. In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Prinz and coworkers showed that the retrograde movement of exogenously added sterols from the PM to the ER is governed by a non-vesicular mechanism that involves ATP-binding cassette transporters (7Li Y. Prinz W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45226-45234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and oxysterol-binding protein-related proteins (8Raychaudhuri S. Im Y.J. Hurley J.H. Prinz W.A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Maxfield and coworkers showed that both vesicular and non-vesicular trafficking mechanisms operate to govern the transport of a naturally fluorescent cholesterol analog dehydroergosterol (9Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Pipalia N.H. Hao M. Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2007; 8: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Earlier, based on inhibitor studies, Metherall and colleagues (11Metherall J.E. Li H. Waugh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2634-2640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and Field and colleagues (12Field F.J. Born E. Murthy S. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that multiple drug resistance proteins may be involved in the retrograde movement of precursor sterols.The Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) protein is a multispan membrane protein containing a sterol-sensing domain, which plays an essential role in the ability of the protein to bind cholesterol (13Ohgami N. Ko D.C. Thomas M. Scott M.P. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Studies using mutant cells that lack the NPC1 protein show that NPC1 is involved in the egress of low density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol from the late endosomes to the PM, ER, and mitochondria (14Wojtanik K.M. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14850-14856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Du H. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25517-25525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, including macrophages, NPC1 is also involved in the post-PM trafficking of biosynthesized cholesterol, and possibly other C27 sterols, from the PM to the ER (17Reid P.C. Sugii S. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1010-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ability of the mutant NPC cells to convert precursor sterols, especially the methylated sterols (i.e. C28, 29, and C30 sterols), to cholesterol, is unknown.In this study, we monitored the intracellular fate of biosynthesized precursor sterols by feeding cells with radioactive acetate, performed pulse-chase experiments, and used several TLC systems to analyze the composition of labeled sterols. We also employed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify various precursor sterols in cells grown in sterol-free media. Our results show that, upon arrival at the PM, precursor sterols rapidly move back from the PM to the ER, to be enzymatically converted to cholesterol. The retrograde movement of the precursor sterols is largely independent of NPC proteins but depends on the functionality of the PM lipid rafts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsVarious reagents and procedures were as described previously (15Sugii S.

All media contain 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin as antibiotics. 25RA is a mutant CHO cell line that is resistant to 25-hydroxycholesterol (19Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7787-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contains a gain-of-function mutation in sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein (20Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The CT43 mutant cell line was isolated from mutagenized 25RA cells as one of the cholesterol trafficking mutants (21Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It contains the same gain-of-function mutation in sterol regulatory element-binding protein cleavage-activating protein, and a premature translational termination mutation near the 3′-end of the npc1 coding sequence, producing a non-functional truncated NPC1 protein (22Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The A101 clone is a CHO cell mutant lacking the NPC1 mRNA and protein; it was isolated from parental CHO cells that express the murine ecotropic retrovirus receptor (JP17 cell). CHO clones A101 and JP17 were from professors Ohno and Ninomiya (Totori University School of Medicine, Japan) (23Higaki K. Ninomiya H. Sugimoto Y. Suzuki T. Taniguchi M. Niwa H. Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Ohno K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A normal Hf cell line (normal-1) was from Dr. Peter Pentchev (formerly National Institute of Health). A second normal Hf cell line, GM00038, was from Coriell Institute (normal-2); a mutant NPC1 human fibroblast cell line, GM03123, was also from Coriell. GM03123 contains two point mutations in the NPC1 protein: P237S and I1061T. The NPC2 human fibroblast cell line was from Dr. Yiannis Ioannou (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) (24Walter M. Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Pulse-Chase Experiments with [3H]AcetateFor CHO cells, cells were seeded into 6-well plates or 100-mm dishes and grown in Medium D for 2 days as described (22Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). For Hfs, cells were plated and grown in Medium A to near confluency, washed twice with PBS, and grown for 2 days in Medium D. To label cells with [3H]acetate, cells were washed with pre-warmed (37 °C) PBS twice, then pulse-labeled with 20 μCi/ml [3H]acetate (20 μCi/well or 100 μCi/100-mm dish) for the time indicated at 37 °C. After pulse labeling, the medium was removed; the cells were washed twice with pre-warmed PBS and incubated with the chase media (pre-warmed Medium D or Medium B) for up to 24 h. In some experiments, the chase media were collected and extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and analyzed for radiolabeled sterols. Cellular lipids were extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v), and cellular protein was solubilized in 0.1 n NaOH to determine protein content (25Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 274-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The non-saponifiable lipids (containing the sterols) were isolated as previously described (26Limanek J.S. Chin J. Chang T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5452-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Sterol Analyses by TLCThe non-saponifiable fractions were spotted onto channeled silica TLC plates and run in methylene chloride/ethyl acetate (97:3, TLC system I) to separate C29/C30, C28, and C27 sterols (27Berry D.J. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Lanosterol and cholesterol were added to the samples to serve as internal standards. After chromatography, the plates were briefly stained with iodine to identify the C29/C30 sterol band and the C27 sterol band. The band located between the C29/C30 and C27 sterol bands is the C28 sterol band (27Berry D.J. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The sterol bands were scraped and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. To examine the sterol composition of the C27 sterols, the C27 sterol bands separated by TLC system I were scraped and extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) twice. The extracts were transferred to new glass tubes, washed once with water, and dried under nitrogen. The C27 sterols were either acetylated as described (27Berry D.J. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) or left non-acetylated. The acetylated C27 sterols were separated by TLC system II on silver nitrate impregnated plates. The plates were prepared by rapidly dipping commercially prepared silver nitrate-impregnated TLC plates in 10% silver nitrate solution (in acetonitrile), followed by air drying. The samples were repeatedly chromatographed (three times), each time for 1 h, using the solvent hexane/benzene (80:20) (28Kammereck R. Lee W.-H. Paliokas A. Schroepfer G.J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 282-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Non-acetylated sterol samples were separated using the silver nitrate-impregnated TLC plates prepared as described above and chromatographed for 4 h in a plastic-wrap sealed glass chamber in 100% chloroform (system III). Plates were run with authentic cholesterol, desmosterol, lathosterol, and zymosterol, or their acetylated derivatives were spotted in parallel lanes as standards. After TLC, the standard-containing lanes were charred by spraying the plates with an orcinol mixture (200 mg of orcinol/100 ml of 75% sulfuric acid) and baked at 100 °C for 20 min. The appropriate radioactive bands in sample-containing lanes were scraped to determine radioactivity using a liquid scintillation counter.

The dried sterol samples were derivatized with 0.25 ml of Sigma-Sil-A (Sigma) at 60 °C for 30 min. The trimethylsilyl derivatives of sterols were injected into a Shimadzu GC-17A gas chromatograph connected to a Shimadzu QP5000 mass spectrometer equipped with an XTI-5 (30 m × 25 μm × 0.25 mm) capillary column. The injector port was set at 290 °C. The initial temp of the oven was 110 °C and was increased at 15 °C/min to 290 °C and held for 10 min. Helium flow was set at 1.3 ml/min. The sterol masses were quantified by using epicoprostanol as an internal standard.Lipid Analyses by Enzymatic AssaysThe cellular free cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids were determined as described before (29Yamauchi Y. Chang C.C. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Reid P.C. Chang T.Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1943-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Cell Fractionation after Cellular Labeling with [3H]Acetic AcidTwo different methods were used to prepare the PM and the internal membrane (IM) fractions.Method I—The PM/IM fractions were prepared by using the 30% Percoll gradient centrifugation method as previously described (15Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Du H. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27180-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Cell homogenates from two 100-mm dishes of cells were prepared and spun at 1,000 × g for 5 min twice, and the resulting 1 ml of post nuclear supernatant was placed onto a 9-ml 30% Percoll solution and centrifuged at 84,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C using a Beckman Type 70.1 Ti rotor. Afterward, ten 1-ml fractions were collected from the top. Lipids from each Percoll fraction were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), saponified, and analyzed by TLC system I. To analyze the purity of the PM/IM fractions, cell surface proteins were biotinylated for 30 min on ice by using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin kit (Pierce); the cell homogenates were then prepared and fractionated by using 30% Percoll gradient centrifugation. Afterward, the detergent Nonidet P-40 was added to each fraction at 1% final concentration; the fractions were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min twice to remove the Percoll particles. Aliquots of each supernatant were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the monoclonal anti-HMG-CoA reductase IgG-A9 (obtained from ATCC). Biotinylated proteins were detected with the Vectastain ATP-binding cassette kit (Vector Laboratories). Densitometric analyses of protein bands were performed by using NIH Image version 1.61.Method II—The PM, IM, and cytosol fractions were prepared by using the procedure previously described (31Metherall J.E. Waugh K. Li H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2627-2633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, post nuclear supernatant was prepared from one 100-mm dish of cells as described above, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min to collect the PM-rich fraction as a pellet. The supernatant was further spun at 200,000 × g for 45 min to yield the cytosol fraction as supernatant and the IM-rich fraction as a pellet. The purities of the PM/IM fractions and the labeled lipids present in these fractions were analyzed in a similar manner as described above. The amounts of free cholesterol and choline-containing phospholipids in these fractions were determined by methods described previously (29Yamauchi Y. Chang C.C. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Reid P.C. Chang T.Y. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1943-1951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We also employed the 11% Percoll gradient centrifugation method (22Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to isolate various crude subcellular fractions. This method efficiently separated late endosomes/lysosomes from other membranes. Ten 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the tube. The endosomes/lysosomes (LE/LYS) were concentrated in fractions 8, 9, and 10. Lipids from each fraction were extracted, saponified, and analyzed with the TLC as described above.CalculationsData were presented as means ± S.D. unless specified in the figure legends. Statistical analyses of results were performed using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. The difference between two sets of values was considered significant when the p value was <0.05.RESULTSER-to PM Anterograde Transport of Biosynthesized Precursor Sterols—To monitor the distribution of newly synthesized precursor sterols inside the cells, WT CHO cells grown in Medium D were incubated with [3H]acetate for 1 h. The labeled cell homogenates were subjected to subcellular fractionation analysis. Initially, two methods were employed (described under “Experimental Procedures”) to prepare the PM, IM, and cytosol fractions. To evaluate the purity of the PM fraction and IM fraction, we biotinylated the cell surface proteins as the PM marker and used the HMG-CoA reductase protein, which resides in the ER where sterols were synthesized, as the IM marker. In Method I, the distribution analyses of these markers (Fig. 2A) show that fractions 1–3 contain ∼75% of the total PM signal. Fractions 4 and 5 contain ∼90% of the total HMG-CoA reductase signal. The labeled sterols present in fractions 1–10 were extracted and analyzed. The results show that the majority (>70%) of newly synthesized C29/C30, C28, and C27 sterols were present in fractions 1–3; <25% were present in fractions 4 and 5 (Fig. 2A). Cholesterol mass analysis showed that its distribution was similar to that of newly synthesized sterols; roughly 70% of cholesterol was present in fractions 1–3, whereas <25% was present fractions 4 and 5 (data not shown). In Method II, the analysis showed that the PM-rich fraction contained 60% of the total cell surface biotinylated protein signals, the IM-rich fraction contained 80% of the total HMG-CoA reductase signal (data not shown). The results of the labeled sterol distribution analysis (Fig. 2B) show that >60% of the newly synthesized C29/C30, C28, and C27 sterols were present in the PM fraction, whereas ∼25% were present in the IM fraction. Small but significant amounts of 3H-labeled biosynthetic precursor sterols were recovered in the cytosol fraction. Cholesterol mass analysis showed that it was mainly recovered in the PM fraction as expected (Fig. 2B, white bar). These results show that the second method tended to underestimate the proportion of labeled sterols present in the PM fraction by ∼10–12% compared with the first method. We sought to test the findings described in Fig. 2 (A and B) by using another approach. Cyclodextrin is a water-soluble molecule that has high affinity for sterols. We and others had previously shown that when 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HCD) is added to the medium of intact CHO cells for 10 min or less, it efficiently removes cell surface cholesterol; in contrast, under the same condition, cholesterol sequestered in the internal membrane compartment(s) is very resistant to extraction by HCD (15Sugii S. Reid P.C. Ohgami N. Du H. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27180-27189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We pulse-labeled the parental 25RA CHO cells and the NPC1-deficient mutant CT43 cells with [3H]acetate for 1 h, then exposed these cells to HCD for 10 min. Labeled lipids in cells and in the media were extracted and analyzed by TLC. The results show that, in both cell types, >35% of the total newly synthesized C27 sterols were accessible to HCD (Fig. 2C). These results, together with Fig. 2 (A and B), suggest that after 1 h of synthesis, most of the biosynthesized C27 sterols is located at the PM. The results in Fig. 2C show that newly synthesized C28 and C29/C30 sterols were also extractable by HCD, although less so than C27 sterols, suggesting that HCD may bind with less affinity toward C28 and C29/C30 sterols than C27 sterols. It is possible that the additional methyl groups present in steroid ring A (the 4,4-methyl moieties) and/or present in the junction between rings C/D (the 14-α-methyl moiety) may hinder the binding between HCD and the sterol molecule. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the C28 and C29/C30 sterols may reside in a microdomain of the PM different from where the C27 sterols reside. The results presented in Fig. 2C do imply that after 1 h of synthesis, a substantial amount of the biosynthesized sterols is located at or near the PM to be extractable to HCD. These results also show that the availability of various newly synthesized precursor sterols to HCD was almost identical between the 25RA and the CT43 cells, indicating that the movement of C28 sterols and C29/C30 sterols to the cell surface was independent of a functional NPC1 protein.FIGURE 2Presence of biosynthetic precursor sterols at the PM. A, on day 0, WT CHO cells were plated in triplicate at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and grown in Medium A (8 ml/dish). On day 1, the medium was switched to Medium D, and the cells were grown for another 2 days. On day 3, the cells were incubated with [3H]acetic acid (20 μCi/ml, 5 ml/dish) for 1 h in Medium F at 37 °C. Cell homogenate was subjected to the 30% Percoll gradient centrifugation analysis (Method I) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Afterward, lipids were extracted from each fraction, and the non-saponifiable lipids were analyzed by the TLC system I to identify radiolabeled biosynthetic precursor sterols. The distribution of biotinylated proteins and HMG-CoA reductase in each fraction were analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data were reported as % of total in each sterol species as indicated. The results shown are averages of two experiments; the error bars indicate the sizes of difference between the average values. B, WT CHO cells were set up and radiolabeled as described above. Cell homogenates were subjected to subcellular fractionation Method II to prepare the plasma membrane (PM), intracellular membranes (IM), and cytosol (CS) fractions (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Afterward, lipids were extracted from each fraction, the non-saponifiable lipids were analyzed by the TLC system I to determine [3H]sterols. Mass of free cholesterol (FC) was determined by the colorimetric assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are reported as % total in each lipid species as indicated. The results shown are averages ± S.D. and are from one of two separate experiments with similar results. C, on day 0, the 25RA and CT43 CHO cells were seeded in triplicate into 6-well trays at a density of 1 × 105 (for 25RA) or 2 × 105 (for CT43) cells per well and grown in 1.5 ml/well in Medium A. On day 1, the medium was changed to Medium D, and the cells were grown for another 2 days. On day 3, the cells were radiolabeled with [3H]acetic acid (20 μCi/ml; 1 ml/well) Medium F for 1 h, sterol efflux was then induced by adding 4% HCD to Medium F for 10 min. Afterward, lipids were extracted from the cells and from the medium, and the non-saponifiable lipids were analyzed by the TLC system I. Data are reported as % total (cell plus medium) in each sterol species present in the medium as indicated.

Thus, one or more PM-to-ER retrograde sterol movement systems are needed to bring precursor sterols arriving at the PM back to the ER, where all the post-squalene cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes reside, for their eventual conversion to cholesterol.Role of NPC Proteins in the PM-to-ER Retrograde Transport of Biosynthesized Precursor Sterols—Because the NPC proteins play an important role in endosomal cholesterol transport, we examined whether the NPC-dependent sterol transport system is involved in the retrograde transport of newly synthesized precursor sterols. It is known that all the enzymes responsible for converting C29/C30 or C28 sterols to C27 sterols are located at the ER. This allowed us to use the conversions of C29/C30 or C28 sterols to C27 sterols as a biological assay to examine the retr"

Overexpression of Sts1 restored normal growth in rad23Δ rpn10Δ but did not overcome the DNA repair defect of rad23Δ. To understand the nature of Sts1 suppression, we characterized sts1-2, a temperature-sensitive mutant. We determined that sts1-2 was sensitive to translation inhibitors, accumulated high levels of multi-Ub proteins, and caused stabilization of proteolytic substrates. Additionally, ubiquitinated proteins that were detected in proteasomes were inefficiently cleared in sts1-2. Despite these proteolytic defects, overall proteasome activity was increased in sts1-2. We propose that Sts1 is a new regulatory factor in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway that controls the turnover of proteasome substrates.

We propose that Sts1 is a new regulatory factor in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway that controls the turnover of proteasome substrates. A major pathway of intracellular protein degradation involves the attachment of a multi-ubiquitin (multi-Ub) 3The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; HA, hemagglutinin; β-gal, β-galactosidase. chain to proteolytic substrates. Ubiquitinated proteins are degraded by the multicatalytic proteasome (8Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). The mechanism of substrate recognition, ubiquitination, and proteasome-specific hydrolysis is well described. However, the events that promote the recognition of multi-Ub substrates by the proteasome are not well defined. For instance, it is unclear whether multi-Ub substrates form unaided affinity-based interactions with the proteasome in vivo or whether regulatory proteins deliver substrates to the proteasome. It is also unclear whether compositionally distinct proteasomes promote the degradation of unique classes of substrates. Rad23 and Rpn10 are multi-Ub chain-binding proteins that play an important role in the degradation of substrates by the proteasome (1van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 2Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 3Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kim I. Mi K. Rao H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3357-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although a significant proportion of purified proteasomes contains Rpn10 (9Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only a small fraction contains Rad23 (10Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the role of Rad23, we generated a yeast strain lacking both Rad23 and Rpn10 and discovered that the double mutant is severely growth impaired and displays significant proteolytic defects (3Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rad23 contains two autonomous sequences: UbL, which binds the proteasome, and UBA domains that interact with multiubiquitin chains. Based on its ability to bind both ubiquitinated proteins and the proteasome, we proposed that Rad23 translocated proteolytic substrates to the proteasome (2Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this model, Rpn10 would represent an ideal proteasome receptor for Rad23-specific substrates. We also determined that expression of high levels of the UbL domain caused stabilization of a reporter protein (2Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). A simple interpretation of this result is that UbL/proteasome binding interferes with the normal docking of native Rad23 with the proteasome, consistent with a shuttle-factor model. In contrast, expression of a Rad23 derivative lacking the UbL domain, but containing UBA sequences, retains efficient interaction with multiubiquitinated proteins but not the proteasome (2Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). We conclude from these findings that Rad23 binds multiubiquitin proteins, before it interacts with the proteasome. These two activities are functionally linked because single amino acid mutations in either UbL or UBA domains cause a proteolytic defect. Further support for the shuttle-factor model was described recently (11Ghaboosi N. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1953-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that Rad23 and Rpn10 function as alternate multi-Ub chain-binding receptors in the proteasome (4Elsasser S. Chandler-Militello D. Mueller B. Hanna J. Finley D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26817-26822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 7Verma R. Oania R. Graumann J. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 2004; 118: 99-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). To understand the proteolytic defect of rad23Δ rpn10Δ, we sought high copy suppressors of its cold temperature growth defect. We isolated Sts1, a poorly characterized protein that lacks distinctive motifs that might offer insight into a biochemical function. However, previous studies showed that Sts1 is required for efficient chromosome segregation (12Houman F. Holm C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), maintaining rRNA stability, and suppressing an ER/Golgi secretion defect (13Liang S. Lacroute F. Kepes F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 270-281PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a mutation in STS1 suppressed the mRNA processing defect of an rna15 mutant (14Amrani N. Dufour M.E. Bonneaud N. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar). Sts1 also interacts with proteasome subunit Rpn11, and Srp1, a nuclear localization signal-binding protein (15Tabb M.M. Tongaonkar P. Vu L. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6062-6073Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The effects of these seemingly unrelated genetic and biochemical interactions have not been resolved. However, the finding that high level expression of Sts1 restored the degradation of a proteolytic substrate in an srp1 mutant suggested an unexpected role in proteolysis. Additionally, a distantly related protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Cut8) regulates the subcellular trafficking of proteasomes (16Takeda K. Yanagida M. Cell. 2005; 122: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Tatebe H. Yanagida M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1329-1338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), providing further evidence of a likely proteolytic function for Sts1. In this report, we show that overexpression of Sts1 suppressed the defects of rad23Δ rpn10Δ. However, the DNA repair defect associated with rad23Δ was not suppressed, and sts1-2 is not sensitive to UV light. (We note that this is contrasted by the DNA damage sensitivity of an S. pombe cut8 mutant). We demonstrate that sts1-2 mutant accumulated high levels of multi-Ub proteins, displayed heightened sensitivity to drugs that generate damaged proteins, and failed to degrade test substrates of the ubiquitin/proteasome system. A physiological substrate (Sic1) is also stabilized in sts1-2. We also determined that multiubiquitinated proteins could bind the proteasome in sts1-2 but were inefficiently degraded. These compelling results indicate that Sts1 encodes a previously unrecognized factor that influences degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—Yeast rad23Δ rpn10Δ was transformed with a galactose-inducible yeast cDNA library (18Liu H. Krized J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and STS1 was isolated as a high copy suppressor of the growth defect at 13 °C. FLAG-STS1 and FLAG-RPN10 were generated by PCR, and expression was induced from the PCUP1 promoter by the addition of 100 μm CuSO4 to the growth medium. SIC1 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into YEplac181, containing two tandem hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes. The gene was expressed from the PCUP1 promoter. DNA encoding sts1-2 was amplified from NA25 (sts1-2ts; Ref. 13Liang S. Lacroute F. Kepes F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 270-281PubMed Google Scholar), and all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Growth Assays and Sensitivity to Translation Inhibitors—Yeast cells were grown in selective medium (∼18 h), transferred to fresh medium, and grown to the exponential phase. The cultures were normalized to a density of A600 ∼ 1.0, and 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted on synthetic medium containing 2% glucose or galactose, and 1 μg/ml l-canavanine, 1 mm paromomycin, or 1 mm neomycin. The plates were incubated at 13, 24, 30, or 37 °C for 3–4 days. UV Survival Assays—The cells were grown in YPD to mid-log phase (∼107 cells/ml), washed with sterile water, and resuspended at A600 of 1. Ten-fold serial dilutions were spread on YPD plates and irradiated at one J/m2/s of predominantly 254-nm UV light, using an American Ultraviolet Co. germicidal lamp. Following irradiation, the plates were wrapped with aluminum foil and incubated at 30 °C until colonies appeared (typically 3–4 days, depending on the genetic background). The number of colonies was counted, and the average of duplicate experiments was plotted. Preparation of Protein Extracts—Yeast cultures were suspended in 250 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by disruption with glass beads. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—One milligram of total protein was adjusted to 1 ml using lysis buffer and combined with 20 μl anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). The samples were incubated for 2 h at 4°C, and FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated. The immobilized proteins were separated in SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with antibodies. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-ubiquitin and anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), and anti-β-gal (Promega). We generated anti-Rpt1 antibodies using recombinant glutathione S-transferase-Rpt1 (Pocono Rabbits). Antibodies against Pab1 were a gift from S. Peltz (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey). Antibodies against Rpn10 and Rpn12 were generously provided by D. Skowyra (St. Louis University). The immunoblotting reactions were detected with Chemi-luminescence Reagent Plus (Perkin-Elmer) and quantified using Kodak ID-3.5 imaging software. Pulse-Chase Measurement of Protein Stability—Protein stability measurements were described previously (19Ortolan T.G. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Madura K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), using the EXPRE35S35S protein labeling reagent (Perkin-Elmer). Fifty milliliter cultures of exponentially growing cells were pelleted and resuspended in 0.4 ml of labeling buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 2% glucose). EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (0.5 mCi) was added, and the suspension was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. The cells were washed with 1 ml of water and resuspended in 0.4 ml of chase buffer (YPD-glucose medium containing unlabeled l-methionine and l-cysteine, and 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide). An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the suspension was immediately withdrawn and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The rest of the suspension was incubated at 30 °C, and 0.1-ml aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated times and frozen. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting estimated incorporation of 35S into acid-insoluble proteins. Lysates containing equal 35S cpm were adjusted to equal volume and combined with anti-β-gal antibodies to immunoprecipitate β-gal proteolytic substrates (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were quantified using Kodak imaging software. To examine Sic1-HA levels, we arrested growth of STS1 and sts1-2 in the G1 phase by growth into stationary phase. Yeast cells were then suspended for 30 min in medium containing 100 μm copper sulfate to induce expression of Sic1-HA. The cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in fresh medium containing 15 μg/ml nocodozole to permit entry into mitotic growth but cause arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Aliquots of the cultures were withdrawn periodically and examined microscopically to gauge release from G1 arrest and to prepare protein extract. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS/PAGE, and immunoblots were incubated with antibodies against the HA epitope and anti-Rad23 antibodies. Proteasome Activity—Total protein extract was prepared from STS1 and sts1-2 that were grown at either 23 or 37 °C (for 2 h) and incubated with the fluorogenic substrate SUC-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (Boston Biochem) to measure chymotryptic activity. Following incubation at 30 °C for 1 h, fluorescence units were determined using a Turner 700 fluorometer. Control reactions containing the proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin allowed us to specifically quantify proteasome-hydrolytic activity. Microscopy—Yeast strains were grown in synthetic medium and fixed in 5% ethanol, and the images were captured using a Zeiss microscope. Sts1 Is a Dosage Suppressor of rad23Δ rpn10Δ—Loss of either Rad23 or Rpn10 does not cause a significant growth defect. However, loss of both proteins caused pleiotropic defects (3Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that were suppressed by overexpressing Sts1 (PGAL1::STS1). Normal growth was restored in rad23Δ rpn10Δ at 13, 23, and 30 °C (Fig. 1A). Significantly, the growth improvement caused by overexpressing Sts1 was comparable with that observed by expressing Rad23 in rad23Δ rpn10Δ. High levels of Sts1 also restored growth of rad23Δ rpn10Δ in medium containing canavanine, neomycin or paromomycin (Fig. 1B), which cause increased levels of damaged proteins. Because defects in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway often cause sensitivity to translation inhibitors (21Chuang S.M. Chen L. Lambertson D. Anand M. Kinzy T.G. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), these results suggest that Sts1 functions in protein degradation. Rad23 is required for efficient nucleotide excision repair (23Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), because rad23Δ is sensitive to UV-induced DNA damage. However, the UV sensitivity of rad23Δ is not exacerbated in rad23Δ rpn10Δ (3Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the DNA repair functions of Rad23 do not overlap with its proteolytic activities with Rpn10. It is significant in this regard that Sts1 suppressed only the growth and proteolytic functions of Rad23 and not the UV sensitivity of rad23Δ rpn10Δ (Fig. 1C). rad23Δ rpn10Δ cells display a large, multi-budded phenotype and are noticeably delayed in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (3Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a failure to properly execute cell division. Overexpression of Sts1 eliminated the aberrant morphology of rad23Δ rpn10Δ cells and restored normal growth (Fig. 1D). We examined the stability of FLAG-Sts1 by pulse-chase methods, and determined that the protein is rapidly degraded, with an in vivo half-life of only a few minutes (Fig. 1E). Surprisingly, the stability of FLAG-Sts1 was further reduced in rad23Δ rpn10Δ but was stabilized in proteasome mutant pre1-1 pre2-2. The sts1-2 mutant protein was much more unstable and not detected in our stability measurements. These findings suggested that the dosage suppression of rad23Δ rpn10Δ might be related to restoring normal levels of Sts1. The ability of Sts1 to suppress the aberrant phenotypes of rad23Δ rpn10Δ suggests that it might perform a regulatory role in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. To understand the mechanism of suppression of rad23Δ rpn10Δ, we investigated the biochemical properties of Sts1. Sts1 Does Not Bind Multiubiquitinated Proteins—Proteins bearing structural similarity to Rad23 have been described (6Saeki Y. Saitoh A. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Diaz-Martinez L.A. Kang Y. Walters K.J. Clarke D.J. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 26Rao H. Sastry A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and several, including yeast Dsk2 (27Biggins S. Ivanovska I. Rose R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and Ddi1 (28Clarke D.J. Mondesert G. Segal M. Bertolaet B.L. Jensen S. Wolff M. Henze M. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1997-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), perform overlapping roles with Rad23. Moreover, these proteins can bind both multi-Ub proteins and proteasome. Because Rad23 and Rpn10 also bind both multi-Ub chains and proteasomes, we speculated that a protein with similar binding properties might suppress rad23Δ rpn10Δ. Therefore, we investigated whether Sts1 possessed either of these biochemical properties of Rad23 and Rpn10. Protein extracts were prepared from wild type cells expressing FLAG-Sts1, FLAG-Rad23, FLAG-Rpn10, or Pre1-FLAG, and applied to FLAG-agarose beads (Fig. 2A). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. We note that the levels of FLAG-Rad23 and FLAG-Sts1 are quite similar. The immunoblot was incubated with antibodies against ubiquitin (Fig. 2A), and as expected, high levels of Ub cross-reacting material were co-purified with FLAG-Rad23 (lane 6; FLAG-IP) and FLAG-Rpn10 (lane 7). Lower levels of ubiquitinated protein were also co-purified with proteasomes (lane 5; Pre1-FLAG). However, no significant interaction with multi-Ub proteins was detected with FLAG-Sts1 (lane 8), demonstrating that, unlike Rad23 and Rpn10, it does not bind ubiquitin. The prominent ∼70-kDa band detected in lane 8 is a nonspecific interaction and is also seen in the control immunoprecipitation from an extract lacking a FLAG-tagged protein (Ctrl). The expression of the FLAG-tagged proteins is shown in the lower panels following incubation of the nitrocellulose filter with anti-FLAG antibodies (left) and after staining the filter with Ponceau S (right). These findings suggest that Sts1 is not a substrate shuttle-factor or receptor for multi-Ub proteins. The expression of high levels of Sts1 resulted in a small increase in the overall levels of high molecular weight multi-Ub proteins in a wild type strain (Extracts; compare lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, overexpression of Rad23 resulted in a highly significant increase in the levels of ubiquitinated proteins (lane 2). The implication of these effects is unclear. Sts1 Can Bind the Proteasome—Because Sts1/sts1-2 proteins are rapidly degraded (Fig. 1E), we surmised that their expression in a proteasome mutant would ease their biochemical characterization. Therefore, to determine whether Sts1 interacted with the proteasome, we expressed either FLAG-Sts1 or FLAG-sts1-2 in pre1-1 pre2-2 (Fig. 2B). Protein extracts were prepared and incubated with FLAG-agarose. Immunoblotting showed that a 19 S proteasome subunit, Rpt1, was co-purified with FLAG-Sts1 and FLAG-sts1-2 from cells grown at 23 and 37 °C (Fig. 2B; FLAG-IP). The same filter was also incubated with antibodies against Rpn12, and a similar interaction was observed. The expression of Rpt1 and Rpn12 was similar in STS1 and sts1-2. These studies suggest that the defect of the sts1-2 mutant protein is not caused by deficient interaction with the proteasome or altered proteasome abundance. Although the interaction between Sts1 and the proteasome is weak, we note that in a control reaction (Ctrl), we did not detect nonspecific purification of proteasome subunits on FLAG-agarose. Stabilization of Proteolytic Substrates—The interaction between Sts1 and the proteasome led us to investigate whether it affected the degradation of proteolytic substrates. We transformed STS1 and sts1-2 with plasmids expressing the engineered substrates Arg-β-gal and Ub-Pro-β-gal. We used pulsechase methods to compare the stabilities of these substrates to Met-β-gal, a stable reporter protein. Pioneering studies by Varshavsky and co-workers (20Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 29Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) using these reagents uncovered the N-end rule pathway of substrate targeting, as well as the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway. Yeast cells were grown to exponential phase at the semi-permissive temperature (30 °C) and then incubated in medium containing [35S]methionine. Following 5 min of labeling, aliquots were withdrawn, and protein extracts were examined, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, Ub-Pro-β-gal was rapidly degraded in a wild type strain. However, Ub-Pro-β-gal was strongly stabilized in sts1-2 (Fig. 3A). The band intensities were quantified, and we determined that the half-life of Ub-Pro-β-gal over the initial 10 min of chase was ∼6 min in the wild type strain and ∼30 min in sts1-2. Arg-β-gal is an N-end rule substrate and was found to be similarly stabilized in sts1-2 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, Met-β-gal was stable in both STS1 and sts1-2. Collectively, these studies showed that substrates of the proteasome are inefficiently degraded in sts1-2. To further investigate a role for Sts1 in protein degradation, we examined the stability of a physiological substrate, Sic1-HA. Sic1 is a key regulator of entry into the cell cycle, and its degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is tightly regulated. We generated Sic1-HA and expressed the protein in STS1 and sts1-2 using the copper-inducible PCUP1 promoter. Because sts1-2 showed no growth defect at low temperature, we grew STS1 and sts1-2 at 23 °C (Fig. 3C) to increase the efficiency of G1 arrest. We confirmed that ∼90% of the cells were arrested in G1 following nutrient deprivation. To increase the level of Sic1-HA, the G1 arrested cells were incubated for 30 min with 100 μm CuSO4. To stimulate reentry of these G1 arrested cells containing higher levels of Sic1-HA into mitotic growth, they were transferred to fresh prewarmed medium (30 °C) containing 15 μg/ml nocodozole. This approach permitted cells to exit the G1 phase and cease growth in G2 and provided a way to monitor the degradation of Sic1-HA within a single cell cycle. The studies described in Fig. 3C showed that the rapid elimination of Sic1-HA following exit from G1 (in both STS1 and sts1-2) under semi-permissive conditions (30°C) obscured any proteolytic defect of sts1-2. Therefore, in the study described in Fig. 3D, we grew STS1 and sts1-2 to a stationary phase at 30 °C to cause partial defect in sts1-2. The cultures were then transferred to 37°C and Sic1-HA levels examined. In contrast to the study described in Fig. 3C, Sic1-HA levels remained elevated in sts1-2 at 37 °C for at least 60 min. Sic1-HA was detectable for up to 240 min (Fig. 3D). The filters were subsequently incubated with antibodies against Rad23, and similar levels were detected in all of the samples that were examined. We are aware that the stabilization of Sic1-HA might be a consequence of a cell cycle progression delay in sts1-2, and further study will be required to resolve this possibility. Nonetheless, the stabilization of β-gal substrates (as well as Sic1-HA) is consistent with our hypothesis that Sts1 is a previously uncharacterized regulatory factor in the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Because Sts1 affects the stability of substrates of distinct targeting mechanisms, we propose that it functions after proteolytic substrates have been targeted by the ubiquitin-conjugating apparatus. We confirmed the temperature-sensitive growth defect of sts1-2 at 37 °C (Fig. 4A, lower left panel) and verified that this defect could be overcome by expressing FLAG-Sts1 from a plasmid (Fig. 4A, lower right panel). In contrast, growth of sts1-2 at 37 °C was not restored by the FLAG-sts1-2 mutant protein (lower right panel). Sensitivity to Translation Inhibitors—Mutations in the Ub/proteasome pathway frequently result in poor growth on medium containing translation inhibitors. One interpretation of this observation is that the Ub/proteasome pathway is required for the degradation of nascent, misfolded proteins that are generated by the ribosome. To determine whether Sts1 played a general role in the Ub/proteasome system, we examined growth in the presence of drugs that induce protein damage. 10-fold serial dilutions of exponential phase cultures of STS1 and sts1-2 were grown (at 23 °C) on medium containing cycloheximide or paromomycin (Fig. 4B). We found that sts1-2 is exceedingly sensitive to cycloheximide and also displayed poor growth on medium containing paromomycin (data not shown). We speculate that this defect will be more severe at the semi-permissive temperature. Sts1 Cannot be Functionally Replaced by Rad23 and Rpn10—To determine whether Sts1 and Rad23/Rpn10 operated in a functionally redundant manner, we simultaneously overexpressed both PGAL1::RAD23 and PGAL1::RPN10 in the temperature-sensitive sts1-2 mutant (14Amrani N. Dufour M.E. Bonneaud N. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 552-562PubMed Google Scholar). However, the growth defect of sts1-2 at 37 °C was not suppressed (Fig. 4C), indicating that Sts1 cannot be replaced by either Rad23 or Rpn10. This finding also suggests that the mechanism of suppression achieved by Sts1 occurred by an alternate mechanism. Sts1 Does Not Contribute to the DNA Repair Function of Rad23—Because high level expression of Sts1 did not overcome the UV sensitivity or rad23Δ rpn10Δ (Fig. 1C), we anticipated that it would not be required for the cellular response to DNA damage. To verify this conjecture, we measured the sensitivity of sts1-2 to 254-nm UV light, at both permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Wild type and sts1-2 cells were grown at 23 °C, incubated for 2 h at either 23 or 37 °C, plated on selective agar medium, and exposed to UV light (at 1 J/m2/s). (The viability of sts1-2 is not affected by incubation at 37 °C for this duration.) UV-irradiated cells were allowed to recover in the dark at 23 °C. We found that the survival of sts1-2 was indistinguishable from the wild type strain following UV light treatment (Fig. 4D), demonstrating that Sts1 contributes to the growth and proteolytic functions of Rad23 but not its DNA repair activities. We recognize, however, that because STS1 is essential for viability, its apparent dispensability in DNA repair cannot be verified unambiguously. Increased Levels of Multi-Ub Proteins in sts1-2—The sensitivity of sts1-2 to translational drugs, and stabilization of proteolytic substrates are consistent with a role in protein degradation. To investigate whether the targeting of proteolytic substrates was altered in sts1-2, we examined the levels of total multi-Ub proteins. Wild type and sts1-2 cells were pregrown at 23 °C and then transferred to 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn periodically, and total proteins were separated in SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. An immunoblot was incubated with antibodies against Ub. At 23 °C the levels of multi-Ub proteins in sts1-2 were similar to the wild type strain (Fig. 5A, 0 h, lanes 1 and 2). However, after transfer to 37 °C the levels of high molecular weight multi-Ub proteins increased progressively in sts1-2 (even-numbered lanes marked ts). The increased levels of multi-Ub proteins in sts1-2 is evident by 1 h (lane 4), and marked elevation was observed by 4 h (lane 8). In contrast, the levels of multi-Ub proteins in STS1 decreased in the corresponding time points at 37 °C (odd-numbered lanes marked WT). Note for instance that at 6 h, only lower molecular weight ubiquitinated species were detected in STS1 (lane 9). We also investigated whether normal levels of multi-Ub proteins would be restored if cells were returned to 23 °C following 6 h of incubation at 37 °C. We fou"

Both thioredoxins have the highly conserved WCGPC motif and function as disulfide-bond reductases. However, thioredoxin-2 has unique features: it has an N-terminal motif that binds a zinc ion, and its transcription is under the control of OxyR, which allows it to be up-regulated under oxidative stress. Here, we report the crystal structure of thioredoxin-2 from Rhodobacter capsulatus. The C-terminal region of thioredoxin-2 forms a canonical thioredoxin fold with a central β-sheet consisting of five strands and four flanking α-helices on either side. The N-terminal zinc finger is composed of four short β-strands (S1–S4) connected by three short loops (L1–L3). The four cysteines are at loops L1 and L3 and form a tetragonal binding site for a zinc ion. The zinc finger is close to the first β-strand and first α-helix of the thioredoxin fold. Nevertheless, the zinc finger may not directly affect the oxidoreductase activity of thioredoxin-2 because the zinc finger is not near the active site of a protomer and because thioredoxin-2 is a monomer in solution. On the basis of structural similarity to the zinc fingers in Npl4 and Vps36, we propose that the N-terminal zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 mediates protein-protein interactions, possibly with its substrates or chaperones.

Oxidative stress causes the damage of DNA, protein, and lipid molecules and also affects their biosynthesis. All cells possess systems that serve as a defense against oxidative stress. These include reducing systems provided by GSH, glutaredoxins, and thioredoxins (1Oktyabrsky O.N. Smirnova G.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2007; 72: 132-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The thioredoxins are small cytoplasmic proteins present in all cells. They serve as reductases that reduce disulfide bonds in a wide range of proteins, including 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate reductase, ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, and the membrane protein DsbD. Thioredoxins have a highly conserved WCGPC motif; during the catalytic cycle, the two cysteines alternate between reduced and oxidized forms. When thioredoxin reduces a disulfide bridge, it itself becomes oxidized. The disulfide in thioredoxin must therefore be regenerated by a thioredoxin reductase, which in turn uses the reducing equivalents derived from NADPH (2Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 3Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). In addition to functioning as an electron donor, thioredoxin is an essential component of the T7 DNA polymerase and is involved in the assembly of a number of filamentous viruses (4Russel M. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bacterial thioredoxin-2 is a recently described cytoplasmic thioredoxin homolog. It shares ∼30% overall sequence identity with thioredoxin-1 and contains an N-terminal extension of about ∼40 residues (5Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin-2 seems to play a role in the protection against oxidative stress, as the deletion of its gene in Rhodobacter capsulatus results in increased sensitivity to oxidative agents (8Li K. Hartig E. Klug G. Microbiology (Read.). 2003; 149: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Zeller T. Li K. Klug G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7689-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Furthermore, under oxidative stress conditions, the expression of thioredoxin-2 is up-regulated by the transcription factor OxyR (6Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 9Zeller T. Li K. Klug G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7689-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), whereas the expression of thioredoxin-1 does not change. The N-terminal extension contains two additional CXXC motifs and binds a zinc ion with high affinity. Based on in vitro experiments with the oxidative agent hydrogen peroxide, it has been proposed that the zinc ion is released from thioredoxin-2 under oxidative stress (7Collet J.F. D'Souza J.C. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45325-45332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the zinc ion is released in intact cells particularly because thioredoxin-2 remains in its reduced state even under oxidative stress (6Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutation of the zinc-binding domain does not affect the oxidoreductase activity of thioredoxin-2 in vivo, at least not for the substrates analyzed (6Ritz D. Patel H. Doan B. Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2505-2512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that the deletion of the zinc finger domain decreases the reductase activity in vitro (5Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin-2 has been found in ∼20 different bacterial species. Proteins with the same name in eukaryotes lack a zinc finger domain. Human thioredoxin-2, an ortholog of bacterial thioredoxin-1, resides in mitochondria. Yeast thioredoxin-2 is an almost identical isoform of cytosolic thioredoxin-1 (10Gan Z.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1692-1696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Smeets A. Evrard C. Landtmeters M. Marchand C. Knoops B. Declercq J.P. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 2610-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As the zinc finger of bacterial thioredoxin-2 is found in different organisms, it is unlikely to be without function. Similar domains are found in many proteins that are involved in DNA, RNA, or lipid binding; in protein-protein interactions; in protein stability; or in the sensing of oxidative stress (12Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The zinc finger motif usually contains ∼20–60 residues with cysteines and/or histidines folded into a tetragonal binding site for a zinc ion. The zinc ion is important in stabilizing the structural fold and binds with high affinity. Although all zinc finger domains share the tetragonal zinc coordination, their structures are as diverse as their functions. It is therefore not easy to predict the structure of a zinc finger domain on the basis of the amino acid sequence. Specifically, a BLAST search using thioredoxin-2 does not reveal any zinc fingers with known structures. The thioredoxin-2 zinc finger contains two CXXC motifs separated by 15–16 residues. A similar pattern is found in DksA (CXXCX17CXXC), transcription factor IIB (CXXCX15CXXC), and ClpX (CXXCX18CXXC) (13Perederina A. Svetlov V. Vassylyeva M.N. Tahirov T.H. Yokoyama S. Artsimovitch I.

The DksA zinc finger has the typical ββα-fold found in many transcription factors that bind directly to DNA; the transcription factor IIB zinc finger has four short strands that are involved in the interaction with RNA polymerase II; and the zinc finger in ClpX has two β-hairpins followed by an α-helix and is involved in homodimerization and substrate interaction (14Donaldson L.W. Wojtyra U. Houry W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48991-48996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 15Zhu W. Zeng Q. Colangelo C.M. Lewis M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 is similar to that in the redox sensor protein Hsp33 (7Collet J.F. D'Souza J.C. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45325-45332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but there is essentially no sequence similarity. The primary sequence of thioredoxin-2 does not reveal much of its function or structure. Here, we report the crystal structure of R. capsulatus thioredoxin-2 at 1.92-Å resolution. Thioredoxin-2 has an N-terminal zinc finger and a C-terminal canonical thioredoxin fold. Our results show that the structure of the N-terminal zinc finger is similar to those of Npl4, Vps36, and transcription factor IIB (16Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R.

We propose that the zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 mediates protein-protein interactions with its substrates or chaperones during the defense against oxidative stress. Cloning and Protein Expression—The R. capsulatus thioredoxin-2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR and cloned into pET28a+ between the NdeI and HindIII sites. The recombinant protein has an N-terminal histidine tag and a thrombin site between the tag and thioredoxin-2. The expression vector was transformed into C43(DE3) cells. The transformed cells were grown to A600 = 0.7 and induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were harvested after culturing at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.0), and cells were broken with a Microfluidizer. The recombinant thioredoxin-2 protein was in the supernatant and purified by Ni-NTA 3The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. chromatography under native conditions. Thrombin was added to the purified sample at a ratio of 10 units of thrombin to 1 mg of recombinant thioredoxin-2. The cleaved sample was concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography in a running buffer of 20 mm HEPES and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Fractions containing thioredoxin-2 were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration ∼10 mg/ml. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—Before trays were set up, dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the protein solution was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Crystals were grown in 28–36% polyethylene glycol 400, 10 mm ZnSO4, and 50 mm N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid, pH 6.5, by the hanging drop method at 22 °C. Crystals usually grew to 200 × 200 × 50 μm3 in 1–2 weeks. Crystals were looped directly from the drop and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected using synchrotron radiation at a zinc peak wavelength of 1.2826 Å at beam line ID19 of the Advanced Photon Source. A data set for single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing was collected. The images were indexed and scaled by HKL3000 (19Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Phasing, map calculation and improvement, and automated model building were done in HKL3000. Briefly, using the zinc SAD data set, the SHELX module in HKL3000 found three zinc sites (20Uson I. Sheldrick G.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The zinc sites were refined and phases were calculated using mlphare (21Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Automated model building was carried out using the ARP/wARP program (22Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The electron density map was further improved by NCS averaging using the NCS operator derived from the partially built model (21Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The map was used for a second round of ARP/wARP automated model building. Most of the model (∼90%) was built. The rest was manually built using Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar). The refinement was carried out in CNS (24Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T.

Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out on reduced thioredoxin-2 in a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-A ultracentrifuge. Three samples with initial concentrations of ∼15, ∼40, and ∼80 μm thioredoxin-2 were loaded on a 6-well cell and centrifuged at three speeds of 24,000, 28,000, and 36,000 rpm. Data were collected after equilibrium was achieved as indicated by no changes in two successive scans separated by 4 h. Data were analyzed by Beckman XL-A data analysis software using MULTIFIT to an ideal self-association model (25Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P.

Protein expression was induced by 0.2% l-arabinose at A600 = 0.1. Cells were grown at 37 or 42 °C after induction and harvested when the cell density reached A600 = 0.5. Cells from 10 ml of culture were lysed in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris and 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8. The supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of Ni-NTA beads. The Ni-NTA beads were washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer and then washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer containing 30 mm imidazole. The proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole. Samples eluted from the Ni-NTA columns were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The bands in the SDS gel were cut out and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School). Overall Structure of Thioredoxin-2—R. capsulatus thioredoxin-2 was crystallized, and its structure was determined using SAD originating from the bound zinc ion (Table 1). Thioredoxin-2 has an N-terminal zinc finger motif and a C-terminal canonical thioredoxin fold (27Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin fold consists of a five-stranded β-sheet with flanking α-helices (Fig. 1A). The secondary structural elements are βαβαβαββα, as shown in Fig. 1B. The distance between the sulfur atoms of Cys73 and Cys76 at the active site is 3.7 Å, indicating that, in the crystal, thioredoxin-2 is in its reduced state. This is expected because 5 mm dithiothreitol was added to the protein solution during crystallization. Nevertheless, the structure can be superimposed on the oxidized form of E. coli thioredoxin-1 with a backbone root mean square deviation of 0.93 Å (Fig. 1C), in agreement with the previous observation that the reduced and oxidized forms of thioredoxin-1 are almost identical (28Jeng M.F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure (Lond.). 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The active sites of thioredoxin-1 and -2 are also very similar (Fig. 1D). The highly conserved WCGPC motif is located at the loop following the central β-strand (β2) and the beginning of the second α-helix. The active-site cysteine (Cys73 in thioredoxin-2 and Cys32 in thioredoxin-1) is at the beginning of helix α2 and is solvent-exposed. This cysteine has a relatively low pKa (29Takahashi N. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8342-8353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The deprotonated thiolate is presumably stabilized by the helical dipole moment of helix α2 (30Holmgren A. Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The second conserved cysteine (Cys76 in thioredoxin-2 and Cys35 in thioredoxin-1) has a higher pKa. It is likely to be deprotonated through a general base catalysis by an aspartic residue in the β2-strand (Asp67 in thioredoxin-2 and Asp26 in thioredoxin-1). Because the carboxyl group of this aspartic residue is ∼5 Å away from the second sulfur atom, the deprotonation is probably mediated by the polarization of a water molecule. Another common feature among the thioredoxins is a positively charged residue (Arg77 in thioredoxin-2 and Lys36 in thioredoxin-1) that interacts with the backbone carbonyl group of the residue preceding the conserved tryptophan (Trp72 and Trp32, respectively). This interaction might be important to maintain the active-site conformation. Overall, thioredoxin-1 and -2 likely use the same mechanism to catalyze disulfide reduction of their substrates.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticData setFor SAD phasingFor structure refinementResolution (Å)50.0 to 2.050.0 to 1.92Unique reflections22,44124,706Redundancy6.7 (4.1)aValues in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell (2.07 to 2.00 Å in the first data set and 1.99 to 1.92 Å in the second)2.9 (1.9)Completeness (%)99.5 (95.3)96.6 (75.1)〈I/σ〉19.2 (2.1)21.2 (2.5)RmergebRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hk l) – Ihkl|/ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl)|, where Ihkl is the average intensity0.089 (0.450)0.066 (0.252)Reflections for RworkcRwork = Σhkl||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl|Fobs|/RfreedRfree is the same as Rcryst for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculations23,512/1194Rwork/Rfree (%)20.5/21.9r.m.s.d.er.m.s.d., root mean square deviation bond length (Å)0.015r.m.s.d. bond angle1.40°Mean B-factor25.4Ramachandran plot (most favored/additionally allowed; %)93.2/6.3a Values in parentheses refer to data in the highest resolution shell (2.07 to 2.00 Å in the first data set and 1.99 to 1.92 Å in the second)b Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hk l) – Ihkl|/ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl)|, where Ihkl is the average intensityc Rwork = Σhkl||Fobs| – k|Fcalc||/Σhkl|Fobs|d Rfree is the same as Rcryst for a selected subset (5%) of the reflections that was not included in prior refinement calculationse r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation Open table in a new tab The N-terminal Zinc Finger—The N-terminal extension of thioredoxin-2 is folded into a zinc-binding finger, consisting of four short strands (S1–S4) connected by three short loops (L1–L3) (Fig. 2A). The S1/S2 strands are hydrogen-bonded with each other and connected by loop L1. The S3/S4 strands are shorter than the S1/S2 strands with fewer hydrogen bonds formed between them; they are connected by the short loop L3. The two CXXC motifs are located in the loops (L1 and L3) at the end of the four strands. The four cysteines form a tetragonal zinc-binding site. The zinc ion is clearly visible in the anomalous difference map (Fig. 2B). The S1/S2 strands are associated with the S3/S4 strands through the zinc ion and through hydrophobic interactions. A number of hydrophobic residues (Leu12 and Val23 in the S1/S2 strands and Pro32, Ile42, and Leu43 in the S3/S4 strands) are involved in packing these two structural elements together (Fig. 2A). These residues are relatively well conserved. Although the hydrophobic interactions are likely to be important, the zinc ion probably plays a dominant role in keeping the S1/S2 and S3/S4 structural elements together. The distance between the zinc ion and the sulfur atoms in the cysteines is <2.3 Å, indicating a strong interaction. In addition to the zinc ion in the zinc finger domain, a second zinc ion, coordinated by His111 and Asp58, is observed in one protomer in the crystal (Fig. 2B). The zinc ion at this site has a relatively low occupancy and is probably bound with low affinity. The Zinc Finger Is Not Near the Active Site of Thioredoxin-2—In our structure, the zinc finger is not close to the WCGPC active site. Rather, it is located at one side of the thioredoxin fold defined by the first strand (β1) and the first α-helix (α1) (Fig. 1, A and B). The zinc ion is almost at the opposite end of the active site, with a distance of ∼30 Å between them. It is thus quite unlikely that the zinc finger can directly affect the reactivity of the active site within the same molecule. It is also unlikely that the zinc finger would directly compete for substrate binding within a protomer. The known structures of complexes between a thioredoxin fold and a substrate (DsbDα·DsbDγ (31Rozhkova A. Stirnimann C.U. Frei P. Grauschopf U. Brunisholz R. Grutter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R.

Structure (Lond.). 1995; 3: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)) indicate that the substrate-binding region is defined by the WCXXC active site at the β2-α2 region and the beginning of the β4-strand where the Gly-Ile-Pro conserved motif is located (Fig. 1D). These regions are far away from the zinc finger domain. Dimer in Crystal and Monomer in Solution—Although the zinc finger is not close to the WCGPC active site or the substrate-binding groove within a protomer, it is conceivable that it could be close to one of these in an oligomer. In our crystals, the two protomers in the asymmetric unit are arranged such that the zinc finger of one protomer is close to the active site of the second protomer (Fig. 3A). Notably, the side chain of the conserved residue Arg77 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Cys37 in loop L3 of the zinc finger. In addition, the side chain of Gln102 is hydrogen-bonded with the carbonyl of Ala16 in loop L1. Finally, residues in loops L1 (Leu15, Ala16, and Cys17) and L3 (Cys37, Gly38, and Ala39) are in van der Waals contact with residues around the active site (Pro71, Trp72, Cys73, Pro75, and Arg77) (Fig. 3A). These interactions suggest that the zinc finger might affect the oxidoreductase activity of the thioredoxin fold in a dimer or higher oligomer. However, several lines of evidence suggest that thioredoxin-2 is monomeric in solution. First, the buried surface between the protomer is relatively small, ∼1016 Å2 (7.5% of the total surface). Second, the reduced form of R. capsulatus thioredoxin-2 runs at the position of a monomer in gel filtration experiments (data not shown). Similar results have also been reported for both the reduced and oxidized forms of E. coli thioredoxin-2 (7Collet J.F. D'Souza J.C. Jakob U. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45325-45332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To exclude that thioredoxin-2 dimerizes with low affinity, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments, which can measure Kd values as low as 1 mm. Thioredoxin-2 at three different concentrations (∼15, ∼40, and ∼80 μm) was used and centrifuged to equilibrium at three different speeds. The data were fit to a self-association model. The best fit was obtained with a monomer species of 14.3 ± 0.6 kDa (theoretical molecular mass of 15.5 kDa) (Fig. 3B). The deviations from the theoretical values (Fig. 3B, upper panels) were close to zero and randomly distributed. The results indicate that thioredoxin-2 is a monomer in solution even at concentrations as high as 80 μm. The dimer observed in the crystal is thus likely to be a non-physiological artifact. It should be noted that in other thioredoxin crystals, dimers or oligomers were also observed in the asymmetric unit (34Bao R. Chen Y. Tang Y.J. Janin J. Zhou C.Z. Proteins. 2007; 66: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Amorim G.C. Pinheiro A.S. Netto L.E. Valente A.P. Almeida F.C. J. Biomol.

Biol. 2000; 302: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Given that the interfaces between the monomers are different in these structures and that the existence of dimers or oligomers in solution has not been demonstrated for any of the wild-type thioredoxins, it appears that all members of the family function as monomers. The Zinc Finger of Thioredoxin-2 Is Homologous to Those That Mediate Protein-Protein Interactions—We performed a Dali search using the zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 (residues 7–44) to find homologous structures. Four structures (Vps36 (Protein Data Bank code 2J9U), Npl4 (code 1NJ3), 30 S ribosomal protein S27e (code 1NVH), and YAF2 (code 2D9G)) were found with Z scores >2 (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar). The structures are considered to be similar if the Dali Z score is >2. All of them contain two CXXC motifs that form a tetragonal zinc-binding site. The length between the CXXC motifs varies from 10 residues in Npl4 to 16 residues in thioredoxin-2. To illustrate the structural similarity, the zinc fingers of Vps36 (code 2J9U) and Npl4 (code 1NJ3) were superimposed on that of thioredoxin-2 with an overall backbone root mean square deviation of ∼1.9 Å (Fig. 4A) (16Wang B.

Williams R.L. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the positions of the zinc ions are very close to each other. Loop L2 is short in Npl4 (shown in yellow) and relatively long in thioredoxin-2 and Vps36 (shown in pink and blue, respectively), yet the overall structure at the zinc-binding site is similar. Among the four proteins, the functions of two zinc fingers (Vps36 and Npl4) have been well studied. Vps36 is a component of the ESCRT-II complex (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) that is involved in the sorting and transport of ubiquitinated proteins to multivesicular bodies. The Vps36 zinc finger binds to Vps28, an ESCRT-I component, with high affinity (nanomolar range). Residues involved in the association (Ile122, Cys123, Asn145, and Cys146) are located in two loops (L1 and L3) of the zinc finger domain (Fig. 4B) (17Teo H. Gill D.J. Sun J. Perisic O. Veprintsev D.B. Vallis Y. Emr S.D. Williams R.L. Cell. 2006; 125: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mutations in the binding interface abolish the binding to Vps28. The zinc finger of Npl4 has been shown to bind to ubiquitin with low affinity (with a Kd of ∼100–200 μm). A conserved TF (Thr13-Phe14) motif immediately following the first CXXC motif has been implicated in ubiquitin binding as shown by chemical shift perturbation and mutagenesis studies. In addition, Met25 near the second CXXC motif is also important for ubiquitin binding. The TF binding surface is not exactly the same as that of Vps36 (Fig. 4B) (16Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20225-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both are located at loops L1 and L3. We noticed two surfaces of the thioredoxin-2 zinc finger that are involved in protein-protein contacts in the crystal. The first binding surface is the one in the dimerization interface (Figs. 3A and 4B). This binding surface resembles that of Vps36 and, to a lesser extent, that of Npl4. The second binding surface is shown in Fig. 4C. It involves the unstructured N terminus (residue 1–7) of one protomer interacting with one side of the zinc finger domain of a symmetry-related molecule. Met2 and Lys5 in the N-terminal segment form four hydrogen bonds with Ala20, Lys22, and Lys33 in the zinc finger (Fig. 4C). On the basis of these interactions and the similarity to other zinc finger domains, we propose that this type of zinc finger mediates protein-protein interactions. Specifically, the zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 may be involved in the binding of substrates and/or chaperones. Thioredoxin-2 has been found to interact with a number of proteins, including the DnaJ and DnaK chaperones, in a large-scale search for interacting proteins in E. coli (38Butland G. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Li J. Yang W. Yang X. Canadien V. Starostine A. Richards D. Beattie B. Krogan N. Davey M. Parkinson J. Greenblatt J. Emili A. Nature. 2005; 433: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Our attempts to confirm the interaction with DnaJ by direct pulldown experiments have been unsuccessful (data not shown). However, the interaction with DnaK could be confirmed by us in experiments in which we pulled down His-tagged thioredoxin-2 with Ni-NTA beads and identified bound proteins by mass spectrometry (Fig. 5). A thioredoxin-2 mutant lacking the zinc domain appeared to bind less DnaK (Fig. 5, lane 3 versus lane 4). These data suggest that the zinc domain may interact with the DnaK chaperone, but they do not exclude the possibility that a fraction of this domain may be unfolded and thus be bound by DnaK. The zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 is different from that of Hsp33, a redox sensor, and from those of DNA-binding proteins. These results indicate that thioredoxin-2 does not act as a redox sensor, is not involved in protecting DNA against oxidative damage, and is not involved in transcription, yet conservation of this domain suggests that it has an important function. On the basis of the structural homology to the zinc fingers of Npl4 and Vps36, we propose that the zinc finger of thioredoxin-2 mediates protein-protein interactions. Thioredoxin-2 Is Conserved among Proteobacteria, and Its Zinc Finger Is Seen in Other Proteins—Although thioredoxin-2 was initially found only in E. coli and Corynebacterium nephridii (5Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E. Gustafsson J. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30841-30847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found 85 homologs using the zinc finger domain (residues 1–40) of the protein from R. capsulatus in a BLAST search. All of these proteins are from Gram-negative proteobacteria, representing all five (α–ϵ) classes. The only exception is the protein from C. nephridii, a Gram-positive actinobacterium. We then performed a pattern search using CXXCX10–20CXXCX30–40WCXXC in which we allowed 10–20 residues between the two CXXC motifs in the zinc finger and 30–40 residues between the second CXXC motif and the WCXXC active site of thioredoxin. We identified 12 additional homologs from Gram-negative proteobacteria, four from Gram-positive actinobacteria (Streptomyces avermitilis, Arthrobacter aurescens, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii, and Mycobacterium flavescens), and one from a Deinococcus-Thermus species (Thermus thermophilus). Thus, thioredoxin-2 is conserved in >100 different bacteria. It is interesting that a zinc finger motif homologous to that of thioredoxin-2 is also present in the Paraquat-inducible membrane protein Pqi and in a diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase from Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8. The zinc finger may thus have evolved from a common ancestor and be used in various proteins as a functional module. This is consistent with our proposal that the N-terminal zinc finger is involved in protein-protein interactions. We thank P. Sliz for organizing synchrotron trips.

Understanding the intricacies of signaling during host-virus interactions should aid in designing disease prevention strategies and in understanding mechanistic aspects of host and pathogen signaling machinery. Methodology/Principal Findings An Arabidopsis mutant, B149, impaired in susceptibility to Tobacco etch virus (TEV), a positive strand RNA virus of picoRNA family, was identified using a high-throughput genetic screen and a counterselection scheme. The defects include initiation of infection foci, rate of cell-to-cell movement and long distance movement. Conclusions/Significance The defect in infectivity is conferred by a recessive locus. Molecular genetic analysis and complementation analysis with three alleles of a previously published mutant lsp1 (loss of susceptibility to potyviruses) indicate a genetic interaction conferring haploinsufficiency between the B149 locus and certain alleles of lsp1 resulting in impaired host susceptibility. The pattern of restriction of TEV foci on leaves at or near the boundaries of certain cell types and leaf boundaries suggest dysregulation of a multidirectional non-cell autonomous regulatory mechanism. Understanding the nature of this multidirectional signal and the molecular genetic mechanism conferring it should potentially reveal a novel arsenal in the cellular machinery."
