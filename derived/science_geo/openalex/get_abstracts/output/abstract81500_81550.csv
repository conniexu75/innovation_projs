https://openalex.org/W1538276446,"Rat hepatoma cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and the insulin receptor subunits were identified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the basal state, only the Mr = 95,000 (beta) subunit of the insulin receptor was phosphorylated. The covalent labeling with 32P of this subunit was stimulated about 3-fold by insulin (10(-6) M). This stimulation was due to an increase in the content of phosphoserine, the appearance of phosphotyrosine, and a possible increase in phosphothreonine as well. These results suggest phosphorylation of the insulin receptor at multiple sites is an early event in insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2133466768,"We have developed a new procedure for introducing macromolecules into cultured mammalian cells based on osmotic lysis of pinocytic vesicles. Cells are first incubated in culture medium containing 0.5 M sucrose, 10% polyethylene glycol 1000 and the macromolecule to be transferred. Cells are then placed in medium diluted with 0.66 parts water. Most pinocytic vesicles formed in the presence of sucrose burst in hypotonic medium, thereby releasing the enclosed macromolecule. L929 cells remain fully viable after a single hypertonic sucrose treatment, and a majority survives four successive rounds of osmotic lysis. This procedure, termed osmotic lysis of pinosomes, has been used to transfer substantial amounts of horseradish peroxidase, antiricin antibodies and dextran 70,000 into the cytosol of L929 cells. Direct comparison of the degree of ricin resistance conferred by transfer of antiricin antibodies revealed pinosome lysis to be equal, if not superior, to injection mediated by red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W2043381701,"Initiation sites for DNA synthesis were located at the resolution of single nucleotides in and about the genetically defined origin of replication (ori) in replicating SV40 DNA purified from virus-infected cells. About 50% of the DNA chains contained an oligoribonucleotide of six to nine residues covalently attached to their 5′ ends. Although the RNA-DNA linkage varied, the putative RNA primer began predominantly with rA. The data reveal that initiation of DNA synthesis is promoted at a number of DNA sequences that are asymmetrically arranged with respect to ori: 5′ ends of nascent DNA are located at several sites within ori, but only on the strand that also serves as the template for early mRNA, while 5′ ends of nascent DNA with the opposite orientation are located only outside ori on its early gene side. This clear transition between discontinuous (initiation sites) and continuous (no initiation sites) DNA synthesis defines the origin of bidirectional replication at nucleotides 5210–5211 and demonstrates that discontinuous synthesis occurs predominantly on the retrograde arms of replication forks. Furthermore, it appears that the first nascent DNA chain is initiated within ori by the same mechanism used to initiate nascent DNA (“Okazaki fragments”) throughout the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2016211106,"We have examined a pair of eyes from a normal, full-term infant who died at 8 days as a result of accidental injury. Eyes were obtained immediately after death, fixed, and sectioned for light microscopy. Results from both eyes were substantially the same. The macular region was still drastically immature at 1 week. Even though a foveal depression existed, all cell layers were still present across it. Furthermore, the inner nuclear layer was divided into two separate layers. The receptor layer was reduced to one or two cells thick; receptors had both inner and outer segments, but they were very short and stumpy. The region of immaturity covered about 5 degrees of the retina. These findings suggest that the central region of a human infant's retina is probably not fully functional at birth."
https://openalex.org/W2075830203,"We have cloned and sequenced a cDNA copy of in vitro-polyadenylated 7SL RNA of HeLa cells. The cloned fragment is 303 bp long and has a composite structure. A central block of 140 bp is homologous to a new set of human middle-repetitive sequences. This block appears to be inserted in an Alu consensus sequence, 100 bp from the 5' end and 40 bp from the 3' end of the Alu monomer. Two 6 bp direct repeats are found at the junction between the Alu flanking sequences and the central element. The analysis of several clones shows the existence of sequence microheterogeneity in the 5' portion of the molecule. The 7L DNA probably represents a subset of the Alu family of DNA, highly conserved in evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1645072707,"We identified two promoters for the beta-lactamase gene of plasmid pBR322. RNA isolated from bacteria containing pBR322 or RNA transcribed in vitro on pBR322 templates was hybridized to 5' end-labeled single-stranded plasmid probes (Berk, A. J., and Sharp, P. A. (1977) Cell 12, 721-732). Electrophoretic analysis of the nuclease S1 digestion products next to Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ladders closely defines the transcriptional initiation points. The natural promoter lies near the coding sequence of the beta-lactamase gene, initiating transcription at -35 bases before the ATG initiation codon, while a second promoter initiates at positions -244 and/or -245 (on the opposite side of the Eco RI site). This promoter overlaps the promoter transcribing in the opposite direction toward the tetracycline gene(s) and starts in the -10 region of that promoter. S1 mapping of procaryotic mRNA, transcribed in vivo, allows both an accurate identification of promoters and the analysis of their transcriptional regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2080429646,"Recent years have seen rapid growth in amino acid sequence data on globins and nucleotide sequence data on haemoglobin genes and pseudogenes, and cladistic analysis1 of these data continues to reveal new facets of globin evolution. Our present findings demonstrate: (1) avian and mammalian embryonic α genes (π and ξ, respectively) had a monophyletic origin involving an α locus duplication about 400 Myr ago soon after the duplication which separated α and β genes; (2) much later in phylogeny, independent β-gene duplications produced the embryonic ρ locus of birds and embryonic ɛ and fetal γ loci of mammals. This parallels the earlier finding2 that myoglobins evolved more than once from generalized globin ancestors. Here we support the view2 that such globin evolution resulted from natural selection acting on mutations in duplicated genes. Thus, our evidence contradicts the neutralist view3,4 in which almost all amino acid substitutions in descent to extant globins evaded positive selection."
https://openalex.org/W1979961380,"Transcription of U1 small nuclear RNA from a 592 bp fragment of human DNA was analyzed in vivo and in vitro. When injected into Xenopus laevis oocyte nuclei, the cloned DNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II to make human U1 snRNA. Thus the sequences of this fragment are sufficient for expression of the U1 snRNA gene. Moreover, injection of templates carrying deletions of flanking sequences demonstrates that the DNA sequences required for in vivo transcription are located at least 100 nucleotides upstream from the point corresponding to the 5′ end of mature U1 snRNA. In vitro transcription in a HeLa cell extract leads to synthesis not of mature U1 snRNA, but of a larger molecule starting 183 nucleotides upstream from the site corresponding to the 5′ end of mature U1 snRNA. Transcription from this upstream promoter also is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II, and is comparable in efficiency with the very strong major late promoter of adenovirus 2. We propose that U1 snRNA is synthesized in vivo as a precursor that is processed by an enzyme or enzymes missing from our extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1978981268,"Monoclonal antibodies against blood forms of Plasmodium falciparum were used to demonstrate considerable antigenic diversity in this species. Different isolates were distinguished by their ability to react with certain antibodies, and most of the antibodies reacted specifically with merozoites, schizonts, or both. The distribution of different antigenic types appeared not to be related to geographic origin. Serological typing with monoclonal antibodies extends the range of methods for identification of different strains of this malaria parasite."

https://openalex.org/W2003258975,"We have cloned and sequenced several distinct loci from the human genome whose sequences agree exactly and are colinear with the sequence of the small nuclear RNA U1. There appear to be 100–150 such U1 loci in the human genome. Although these loci are not in close clusters or in small tandem repeats in the genome, the majority of them have remarkably similar genomic environments. Several potential RNA polymerase termination sites exist in the immediate 3′ flanking regions of the loci studied; however, no TATA box is found in the immediate 5′ flanking sequences. These observations, with the findings of others concerning the transcription of U1, suggest that U1 RNA is synthesized from a family of transcription units. These data are consistent with the proposal that RNA polymerase II may synthesize primary transcripts from these transcription units, which are processed at both the 5′ and 3′ ends to yield mature U1 RNA and possibly other RNA species of unknown function."
https://openalex.org/W2115222828,"Transcripts from the four different Drosophila melanogaster α-tubulin genes were detected by filter hybridization experiments that used subcloned fragments from each gene as hybridization probes. These hybridization experiments demonstrated that each gene is transcribed. All of the transcripts are found on polysomes and are long enough to encode an α-tubulin protein. The hybridization studies were extended to examine the developmental pattern of RNA concentrations. The concentration of RNAs from the α2 and α4 genes vary independently and dramatically, while those from α1 and α3 have parallel variations. We conclude that at the RNA level of expression, two α-tubulin genes are regulated in parallel and two genes are not. We hypothesize that the different concentration patterns reflect different functions for the protein products of each gene."
https://openalex.org/W1492806269,"The involvement of DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma in DNA repair synthesis was investigated in subcellular preparations of cultured hamster and human cells. A variety of DNA damaging agents, including bleomycin, neocarzinostatin, UV irradiation, and alkylating agents, were utilized to induce DNA repair. The sensitivity of repair synthesis, as well as replicative synthesis and purified DNA polymerase beta activity, to inhibition by the DNA polymerase inhibitors dideoxythymidine triphosphate, aphidicolin, cytosine arabinoside triphosphate, and N-ethylmaleimide was determined. No evidence was obtained for a major role of polymerase gamma in any type of repair synthesis. In both hamster and human cells, the sensitivity of bleomycin- and neocarzinostatin-induced repair synthesis to ddTTP inhibition was essentially identical with that observed for purified polymerase beta, indicating these repair processes proceeded through a mechanism utilizing polymerase beta. Repair synthesis induced by UV irradiation and alkylating agents was not sensitive to ddTTP, indicating repair of these lesions occurred through a pathway primarily utilizing a different DNA polymerase; presumably polymerase alpha. However, replicative synthesis was much more sensitive to polymerase alpha inhibitors than was repair synthesis induced by UV irradiation or alkylating agents. Neither the amount of DNA damage nor the amount of induced repair synthesis influenced the degree to which the different DNA polymerases were involved in repair synthesis. The possibility that patch size or the actual type of DNA damage determines the extent to which different polymerases participate in DNA repair synthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1968239269,"Research on the early development of the sea urchin offers new insights into the process of embryogenesis. Maternal messenger RNA stored in the unfertilized egg supports most of the protein synthesis in the early embryo, but the structure of maternal transcripts suggests that additional functions are also possible. The overall developmental patterns of transcription and protein synthesis are known, and current measurements describe the expression of specific genes, including the histone genes, the ribosomal genes, and the actin genes. Possible mechanisms of developmental commitment are explored for regions of the early embryo that give rise to specified cell lineages, such as the micromere-mesenchyme cell lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2150096453,"A library of cDNA clones was constructed from adult rat skeletal muscle mRNA, from which a set of contractile protein clones was selected. These clones were identified by sequencing the cDNA inserts and comparing the derived amino acid sequences with published sequences of rabbit contractile proteins. In this manner, clones corresponding to myosin light chains 1, 2, and 3, troponin-C, troponin-T, alpha-tropomyosin, and alpha-actin were identified. A high degree of amino acid sequence conservation was found upon comparison of the rat and rabbit proteins. Using the cDNA clone panel, we analyzed the expression of abundant rat muscle mRNAs. We show that abundant rat muscle mRNAs can be classified into four developmentally regulated groups, based upon their expression at different stages of myogenesis. One class of mRNAs is expressed during all stages of muscle development. Since these mRNAs are also present in nonmuscle tissues, we conclude that they code for housekeeping proteins. The second class of mRNAs is present in both embryonic and adult muscle, while a third class of mRNAs is expressed only in adult muscle. A small number of mRNAs, which are present at greater levels in undifferentiated myoblasts than in adult muscle, comprise a fourth class. These results suggest the existence of at least four modes of gene control during myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012887097,"The sequence of two human beta-tubulin pseudogenes is described. One contains an intervening sequence but lacks sequences encoding the 55 N-terminal amino acids of the polypeptide chain. A second has no introns but has a polyadenylate signal and an oligoadenylate tract at its 3' end, and it is flanked by a short direct repeat. These sequences have arisen by different mechanisms, including one that probably involves reverse transcription of a processed messenger RNA and reintegration of the complementary DNA copy into the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2093047556,"Repetitive presynaptic stimulation elicited slow membrane depolarization in neurons of inferior mesenteric ganglia from guinea pigs. This response was not blocked by cholinergic antagonists but was specifically and reversibly inhibited by a substance P analog, (D-Pro2, D-Phe7, D-Trp9)-substance P, which also depressed the depolarization induced by exogenously applied substance P. The atropine-sensitive slow excitatory and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials evoked in neurons of rabbit superior cervical ganglia were not affected by the substance P analog. These and previous results provide strong support for the hypothesis that substance P or a closely related peptide is the transmitter mediating the slow depolarization. The latter may represent a sensory input from the gastrointestinal tract to neurons of the prevertebral ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W1587694577,"De novo synthesis on poly(dT) by a novel mouse polymerase, here named DNA replicase, was examined for the synthesis of RNA which functions as a primer in the subsequent synthesis of DNA. As has been reported previously (Yagura, T., Kozu, T., and Seno, T. (1982) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 91, 607-618), a novel RNA polymerase activity, which is distinguished from those of classical RNA polymerases, is associated with replicase. The synthesis of RNA and by replicase (Mr = 16 X 10(4), by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis) was greatly stimulated by a specific stimulating factor (Mr = 13 X 10(4), by glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis) which was found to consist of two subunits (Mr = 63 X 10(3), by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). Nearest neighbor analysis in which transfer of 32P from alpha-labeled nucleoside triphosphates to ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides was examined, showed th at RNA of 8-10 nucleotides long was covalently linked to the 5'-end of the product molecule. This RNA, named initiator RNA, had a triphosphate group at its 5' terminus and its size and synthesis were little affected by the addition of high concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphate, while in these conditions deoxyribonucleotides were incorporated into initiator RNA to a limited extent. The characteristics of the replicase and stimulating factor that cooperate to synthesize initiator RNA for subsequent synthesis on single-stranded are important because these components seem to be involved in a reaction required to initiate the synthesis of discontinuous earliest intermediates (Okazaki fragments) in chromosomal replication of eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524691160,"A colorimetric assay of DNA breakage by bleomycin has been standardized and indicates that strand scission is stoichiometric with the formation of a single equivalent of an aldehyde compound consisting of base plus deoxyribose carbons 1' to 3'. Both strand scission and aldehyde formation require the presence of O2. An alternate DNA lesion inflicted by bleomycin, alkali labilization, is O2-dependent, as is the accompanying release of free bases."
https://openalex.org/W2081252402,"Eukaryotic cells contain a set of low molecular weight nuclear RNA's. One of the more abundant of these is termed U2 RNA. The possibility that U2 RNA is hydrogen-bonded to complementary sequences in other nuclear RNA's was investigated. Cultured human (HeLa) cells were treated with a psoralen derivative that cross-links RNA chains that are base-paired with one another. High molecular weight heterogeneous nuclear RNA was isolated under denaturing conditions, and the psoralen cross-links were reversed. Electrophoresis of the released RNA and hybridization with a human cloned U2 DNA probe revealed that U2 is hydrogen-bonded to complementary sequences in heterogeneous nuclear RNA in vivo. In contrast, U2 RNA is not base-paired with nucleolar RNA, which contains the precursors of ribosomal RNA. The results suggest that U2 RNA participates in messenger RNA processing in the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1504940558,"The minor nucleoside 7-methylguanosine occurs in Escherichia coli 16 S ribosomal RNA at a single site. High pressure liquid chromatographic analysis shows that a single residue of 7-methylguanosine is also present in chloroplast 16 S ribosomal RNA, presumably at an analogous position in the sequence. Antibodies to 7-methylguanosine were induced in rabbits and shown to be highly specific for the intact methylated base. These antibodies were reacted with 30 S ribosomal subunits from E. coli and from the chloroplasts of Alaskan peas. These two types of ribosome have been shown to be topographically similar (Trempe, M. R., and Glitz, D. G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11873-11879). Electron microscopy of the subunit-antibody complexes showed similar subunit-IgG monomers and antibody-linked subunit dimers. In greater than 95% of the complexes observed for each type of ribosome, antibody contact was consistent with a single binding site, which places 7-methylguanosine near the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds of the subunit and maximally distant from the platform. The analogous localization in both E. coli and chloroplast 30 S ribosomal subunits lends support to their proposed common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W1495292782,"Pancreatic poly(A) RNA isolated from the channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) was enriched for sequences corresponding to somatostatin mRNA on isokinetic sucrose gradients. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized and inserted into the Pst I site pBR322 via the poly(dG) . poly(dC) tailing method. Escherichia coli was transformed with this DNA, and colonies containing somatostatin cDNA sequences were identified by hybridization using a primer-extended somatostatin cDNA. The somatostatin cDNA was obtained by extending a 5'-labeled undecanucleotide primer complementary to somatostatin mRNA with reverse transcriptase using catfish poly(A) RNA as a template. The synthetic primer d(T-T-C-C-A-G-A-A-G-A-A) was deduced from the amino acid sequence Phe-Phe-Trp-Lys present in somatostatin-14. Twenty positive colonies were obtained upon screening 2000 transformants. The restriction maps of the plasmid DNA obtained from the positive colonies were examined. Nineteen of these plasmids contained sequences corresponding to somatostatin-14, while one contained a sequence corresponding to somatostatin-22. The nucleotide sequence of pancreatic somatostatin-14 is reported here. The cDNA contains 350 nucleotides in the 3' noncoding region, 345 nucleotides in the coding region, and 104 nucleotides in the 5'-untranslated region. The mRNA codes for a precursor to somatostatin which is 114 amino acids in length. The preprosomatostatin has a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at the NH2 terminus, followed by a connecting peptide of approximately 75 amino acids. The sequence Arg-Lys precedes somatostatin-14. Analysis of genomic DNA from the channel catfish reveals that somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-22 are present on different restriction fragments."

https://openalex.org/W1490819094,"Treatment of human fibroblast cells with human interferon (INF-alpha, IFN-beta, or IFN-gamma) resulted in the accumulation of at least four newly synthesized mRNAs. The mRNAs code for proteins having molecular weights of 56,000, 57,000, 62,000, and 68,000 when characterized in a wheat germ cell-free translation system. A direct relationship was observed between the amount of IFN used and the degree of both the accumulation of the induced mRNAs and the development of an antiviral state. In the case of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta, time course studies indicated that the induced mRNAs appeared as early as 40 min, accumulated for 2 h, then remained ribosome bound for up to 16 h. The ability of fibroblast cells to develop an antiviral state always coincided directly with both the appearance and the level of accumulation of the induced mRNAs. Further mRNA synthesis beyond 2 h had a minimal effect on the development of an antiviral state. Human IFN-gamma also induced the synthesis of the same four mRNAs but required higher interferon titers and a longer incubation time. In addition, IFN-gamma induced a disproportionate amount of the mRNA coding for the 68,000 molecular weight protein and three new mRNAs not detected in cells treated with IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. Mouse interferon induces the original four mRNAs in human cells but to a far lesser extent. This correlated with the inability of these cells to develop much resistance to viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1606916486,"Recent progress in the chemical synthesis of DNA has now made it possible to rapidly synthesize single-stranded DNAs over 40 bases in length. We have taken advantage of these longer DNAs in assembling and cloning a 132-base pair gene segment coding for amino acids 126 through the stop codon of human leukocyte interferon alpha 2. The method used involves DNA polymerase I-mediated repair synthesis of synthetic oligonucleotide substrates having short stretches of complementary sequence at their 3' termini. In the presence of DNA polymerase I and the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, those primer-templates are converted to full length double-stranded DNAs. The economy in chemical synthesis using this approach is substantial with a greater than 40% reduction in the amount of chemical synthesis required as compared with the conventional approach. We describe in detail this methodology for the biochemical assembly of long gene segments from synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1603656984,"The specific nucleotide recognition and sequence-specific cleavage of DNA by bleomycin (BLM) antibiotics are a typical example of macromolecular receptor-drug interaction in the field of chemotherapy. The present results demonstrate that ethidium bromide, distamycin A, and actinomycin D evidently altered the nucleotide sequence-specific mode of DNA breakage by the iron-BLM system, which cleaves isolated DNA preferentially at G-C (5' leads to 3') and G-T (5' leads to 3') sequences. In the presence of ethidium bromide, the most preferred cleavage site was the sequence G-T at position 52 to 53. Of special interest is marked alteration of the nucleotide sequence-specific mode by distamycin A. This intercalator masked the cleavages at G-T and G-A sequences, and produced higher specificity for G-C sequences than that of iron-BLM only. In the case of actinomycin D, the preferred sequence groups of DNA breakage were shifted from G-C sequences to G-A (43 to 44) and G-T (52 to 53) sequences. Certain intercalating agents are very available for the investigations of site-specific recognition and cleavage of DNA by DNA-cleaving drugs such as BLM."
https://openalex.org/W1618695346,"The Sp diastereomer of thymidine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate) was polymerized by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase using poly(A) . d(pT)10 as template-primer. Degradation of the template poly(A) by alkaline hydrolysis and isolation by gel chromatography gave a single-stranded poly(d(p(S)T)), a polymer of thymidine 5'-phosphorothioate. To determine the configuration of the phosphorothioate internucleotide linkage, this material was degraded by snake venom phosphodiesterase. Comparison of the rates of degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase of poly(d(p(S)T)) prepared by reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase I showed them to be very similar. Since it has been established earlier than the latter enzyme produces polymers with phosphorothioate linkages of the Rp configuration (Burgers, P. M. J., and Eckstein, F. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 6889-6893), it is concluded that the polymer produces by reverse transcriptase has the same stereochemistry. Further proof for this assignment comes from comparison by 31P nmr of this polymer with the diastereomers of synthetic 5'-O-thymidyl 3'-O-thymidyl phosphorothioate. The chemical shift observed for the polymer was identical with that of the Rp isomer of 5'-O-thymidyl 3'-O-thymidyl phosphorothioate. Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase therefore polymerizes deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates with inversion of configuration at the alpha-phosphorus. This result indicates that direct nucleophilic attack by the 3-hydroxyl group of the growing polymer on the alpha-phosphoryl group occurs without formation of a covalent enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W2346052124,"We have investigated the transcriptional specificity of chick embryo erythroid nuclei as a function of developmental age during progression of the hemoglobin switch. Nuclei were allowed to transcribe in vitro in the presence of high specific activity [alpha-32P]CTP and the radioactive transcripts were hybridized to a collection of plasmid clones spanning the beta-like globin gene region of the chicken genome. The results reveal locus-specific waves of transcription appearing during the interval between 5 and 12 days of incubation. The last wave, which comes in at 12 days, is highly specialized in transcription of the adult beta-globin gene locus. The most interesting wave of transcription occurs at 6-7 days. The most actively transcribed gene in the early part of this wave is the embryonic rho gene. As the wave progresses, the rho gene activity gradually gives way to beta gene transcription. Definitive red blood cells, which would be synthesizing little rho globin protein at this stage, appear to be responsible for the rho gene transcription. These results and additional data which we present indicate that during the initial stages of the hemoglobin switch the embryonic globin genes are silenced post-transcriptionally."
https://openalex.org/W1545326933,"One of the mediators of interferon action is an endonuclease system. This consists of (2'-5')(A)n synthetase, which, if activated by double-stranded RNA, converts ATP into (2'-5')(A)n and RNase L, a latent endoribonuclease, which binds (2'-5')(A)n and is thereby activated. We report here that a derivative of (2'-5')(A)n (i.e. (2'-5')pppApApA[32P]pCp) can be covalently cross-linked by UV irradiation to a protein in cytoplasmic extracts from mouse Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. This protein has an apparent molecular weight of 77,000 as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. It appears to be identical with RNase L according to the following criteria: co-chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephacryl S300. The gel filtration in Sephacryl S300 reveals that the apparent molecular weight of the protein is between 70,000 and 90,000, indicating that it is a monomer. The cross-linking is oligonucleotide specific. It is inhibited by 10 nM (2'-5')pppApApA or 1 microM (2'-5')ApApA, i.e, compounds known to block, even at low concentration, the binding of (2'-5')pppApApApCp to RNase L. (3'-5')ApApA inhibits only at a 0.1-1 mM concentration, and 1 mM ATP, 2'-AMP, or 5', 3'-pCp have no effect. (2'-5')pppApApApCp was also cross-linked to a protein with a molecular weight of about 78,000 (as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate) in cytoplasmic extracts from human (HeLa) cells and to protein(s) with molecular weight(s) of 75,000-77,000 (as determined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate) in nuclear extracts from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1841497115,"The acid and base stability of the phosphoryl bond of phosphotyrosine (Tyr-P) was studied using conditions for rapid and complete hydrolysis of protein peptide bonds. A method was developed for the quantification of Tyr-P in proteins using rapid base hydrolysis and an amino acid analyzer equipped with a fluorometric detection system. The recovery of [32P]Tyr-P from base digests of radiolabeled samples of phosphotyrosyl glutamine synthetase, transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus, casein, and rabbit anti-sarcoma IgG was 80 +/- 2%. Phosphotyrosine could not be detected in several commercial histone samples, but Tyr-P was detected in phosvitin samples. The putative Tyr-P from the phosvitin hydrolysate was separated from normal amino acids by Dowex 50-H+ chromatography. Treatment of the partially purified Tyr-P with bacterial alkaline phosphatase produced tyrosine in near equivalent quantities to the measured level of Tyr-P. These results show that basic hydrolysis of phosphotyrosyl proteins yields Tyr-P in constant and good yields which can be quantified in amounts greater than or equal to 100 pmol or radiochemically detected in smaller amounts with an amino acid analyzer."
https://openalex.org/W2040697100,"The messenger RNA for a beta-crystallin polypeptide with a molecular size of 27 kilodaltons, first detected 5 to 10 days after birth in the normal mouse lens and the Nakano mouse cataract, was not detected in the Philly mouse cataract with translation in vitro. The heterozygous Philly lens had intermediate levels of the 27-kilodalton beta-crystallin polypeptide and exhibited delayed onset of the cataract. The deficiency of functional 27-kilodalton beta-crystallin messenger RNA is the earliest lesion reported yet for the Philly lens and points to a transcriptional or posttranscriptional developmental defect in this hereditary cataract."
https://openalex.org/W2082629455,"Interruption of the ascending noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus in the rat forebrain with 6-hydroxydopamine produced a progressive accumulation, proximal to the lesion, of tritiated dihydroalprenolol binding activity over 2 days. This accumulation could be blocked by interrupting the neurons closer to their cell bodies. Competitive binding studies with the beta 2 agonist Zinterol suggested that the accumulated beta-receptors were primarily of the beta 1 subtype. These results suggest that, in the rat brain, some beta 1-adrenoreceptors are located in presynaptic, noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons and are transported in their axons."
https://openalex.org/W1967694561,"The oligonucleotide (2′-5′) oligoadenylate that is induced in interferon-treated animal cells protects plant tissue from infection by the tobacco mosaic virus. This inhibition of virus multiplication was obtained at concentrations comparable to those affecting protein synthesis and antiviral activities in animal cells. After treatment with (2′-5′) oligoadenylate, the multiplicability of tobacco mosaic virus was reduced by 80 to 90 percent, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results, along with the observation that human interferon protects tobacco tissue from infection by tobacco mosaic virus, indicate that plants and animals may have a common pathway for virus resistance."

In analogy with results obtained using certain cytochrome P-450 analogs, cis-stilbene was converted cleanly to the respective oxide, while no more than traces of trans-stilbene oxide were formed from trans-stilbene under identical conditions. The possible relevance of these observations to the degradation of DNA by bleomycin was also studied. In both the presence and absence of O2, BLM . Cu(II) . C6H5IO effected DNA degradation, as judged by the release of [3H]thymine from radiolabeled Escherichia coli DNA. These findings provide a valuable new assay system for the study of bleomycin analogs and suggest the possibility that bleomycin may function as an oxygen transferase in its degradation of DNA in situ."

Analysis of the specificity of these antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassay and by diazobenzyloxymethyl cellulose transfer techniques revealed that the antibody cross-reacts strongly with intact H5 and histones H1(0)a and H1(0)b purified from ox liver but not with the four core calf thymus, or with high mobility group proteins. We conclude that the globular region of H5 is serologically homologous to that of H1 degrees and suggest that possible functional similarities between the two proteins reside in this region."

https://openalex.org/W2074336417,"A new process has been developed which is called ""Boradeption"" to signify boronic acid--dependent phase transfer of water-insoluble agents. Highly fluorescent boronic acid dervatives, FluoroBoras, are solubilized with a physiologically compatible carrier buffer containing a receptor group for boronate adduct formation. The system can be used to stain living cells. In another variation of the Boradeption concept, an insoluble reporter molecule containing a boronate receptor is solubilized with a carrier buffer containing a boronic acid functional group. The boronate-receptor complexes, which are in dynamic equilibrium, can be designed as vital stains and reagents for a variety of biological and medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1479704195,"Conformation-specific antibodies against distinct regions of Factor X were employed to locate antigenic determinants which are altered during zymogen activation or by metal binding. Anti-Factor X antibodies, raised in rabbits against Factor X, were purified by affinity chromatography using Factor X covalently bound to Sepharose. Quantitative equilibrium and kinetic measurements of precipitation of Factor X and Factor Xa by antibodies indicated differences in the antigenic structure of the zymogen and the enzyme form of factor X. The factor X antibodies were further fractionated by sequential immunoabsorption using fragments of Factor X and Factor Xa. With conformation-specific antibodies directed against the heavy chain and the light chain of Factor X, zymogen activation was shown to involve a structural transition in the heavy chain but not the light chain. Antibodies directed against the activation peptide domain 1-51 of the heavy chain, the trypsin-like region of the heavy chain 52-290, and the substrate-binding site suggest a generalized conformational transition in the heavy chain. Antibodies were isolated which are specific for the Factor X:Ca(II) complex and bind to Factor X only in the presence of metal ions. Subfractions were directed against either the heavy chain or the light chain, indicating that both the heavy chain and the light chain of Factor X undergo a metal-induced conformational transition. Half-maximal antibody-factor X interaction was observed at 0.13 mM CaCl2 for the light chain and 0.7 mM CaCl2 for the heavy chain. These results indicate that zymogen activation is limited to structural changes in the heavy chain, but metal binding is associated with changes in the structure of both the heavy and light chains. Metal-dependent binding of Factor X to the platelet Factor Xa receptor after activation may involve surfaces of the heavy as well as the light chains."
https://openalex.org/W1526278925,"Densitometric scans of electron micrographs of type I collagen segment long spacing crystallites stained with uranyl acetate or phosphotungstic acid and uranyl acetate have been correlated with computer-synthesized scans derived from the sequence of the alpha 1(I) and alpha 2 chains. Three models that differ in the location of the alpha 2 chain were used in the computer synthesis; Models A, B, and C have the alpha 2 chain in the A, B, and C chain positions, respectively. For all 13 experimental scans, the order of decreasing correlation with the models was found to be A,B,C. The probability of getting the same order of decreasing correlation all 13 times is 6/6(13). It was also determined at the 0.99 confidence level that the mean of the differences in the correlation coefficients among the models is greater than 0, supporting the conclusion that sequence-derived models best fit the experimental data when the alpha 2 chain is in the A position. Our results also agree with recent studies that show that uranyl ions bind to both positively and negatively charged residues on collagen type I."

https://openalex.org/W1603886887,"Two recombinant plasmids containing structural gene sequences of chick embryonic heart glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP dehydrogenase) were constructed and characterized. The plasmids pGAP 30 and pGAP 36 have inserts of 1200 and 950 base pairs, respectively. The identity of the clones was established by hybrid-arrested and hybrid-selection translation assays, and by immunoprecipitation of hybrid-selected translation product with GaP dehydrogenase antiserum. Hybridization of labeled pGAP 30 DNA to size-fractionated chick heart poly(A) RNA occurred at the region on the gel corresponding to the mobility of GAP dehydrogenase mRNA. Base sequence analysis of plasmid pGAP 30 and the comparison of the amino acid sequence derived from it with that of pig muscle GAP dehydrogenase revealed that the amino acid sequence of GAP dehydrogenase is strictly conserved between the chick and pig muscle tissues. Expression of GAP dehydrogenase mRNA in developing chick heart cells in cultures was monitored by in situ hybridization. The GAP dehydrogenase mRNA was present in 5-h-old dividing myoblasts, in contrast to mRNAs specific for contractile proteins, which appear late in myoblast development paralleling morphogenetic differentiation of myoblasts into myocytes (Jakowlew, S. B., Khandekar, P., Datta, K., Narula, S. K., Arnold, H. H., and Siddiqui, M. A. Q. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 156, 673-682)."
https://openalex.org/W1566295059,"The inhibitory effect of human alpha-fetoprotein on the protein synthesis (incorporation of [3H]leucine into the total protein fraction) weas observed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free system. The incorporation was inhibited to 50% of the control level by 14-16 microM alpha-fetoprotein, and decreased to about 15% at a concentration higher than 40 microM. An almost identical dose dependence was obtained between fetal alpha-fetoprotein and hepatoma-derived alpha-fetoprotein. This inhibitory effect on the protein synthesis was due to the interference of alpha-fetoprotein to the 40 S initiation complex formation from the ternary complex (eukaryotic initiation factor 2.GTP.Met-tRNAfMet). In contrast human serum albumin purified from fetal cord sera did not exhibit this inhibition under the same conditions. These results indicate that alpha-fetoprotein may function as a regulator of the protein synthesis in the fetal stage."
