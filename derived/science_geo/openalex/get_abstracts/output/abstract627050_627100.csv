https://openalex.org/W2912967789,"Summary Lung cancer is closely associated with chronic inflammation, but the causes of inflammation and the specific immune mediators have not been fully elucidated. The lung is a mucosal tissue colonized by a diverse bacterial community, and pulmonary infections commonly present in lung cancer patients are linked to clinical outcomes. Here, we provide evidence that local microbiota provoke inflammation associated with lung adenocarcinoma by activating lung-resident γδ T cells. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice were significantly protected from lung cancer development induced by Kras mutation and p53 loss. Mechanistically, commensal bacteria stimulated Myd88-dependent IL-1β and IL-23 production from myeloid cells, inducing proliferation and activation of Vγ6+Vδ1+ γδ T cells that produced IL-17 and other effector molecules to promote inflammation and tumor cell proliferation. Our findings clearly link local microbiota-immune crosstalk to lung tumor development and thereby define key cellular and molecular mediators that may serve as effective targets in lung cancer intervention."

Our work provides a framework for comparative single-cell analysis across tissue regions and species. Most primates, including humans, see objects clearly only when they look straight at them, so their image falls on a small central region of the retina called the fovea (Figure 1A). This is because the fovea, which may be the only primate-specific structure in the mammalian central nervous system, mediates high acuity vision. Although it occupies <1% of the retinal surface, it provides ∼50% of the input to primary visual cortex (Bringmann et al., 2018Bringmann A. Syrbe S. Görner K. Kacza J. Francke M. Wiedemann P.

Eye Res. 2013; 35: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Diseases that selectively affect this region, such as macular degeneration, are leading causes of human blindness in the developed world (Bourne et al., 2013Bourne R.R. Stevens G.A. White R.A. Smith J.L. Flaxman S.R. Price H. Jonas J.B. Keeffe J. Leasher J. Naidoo K. et al.Vision Loss Expert GroupCauses of vision loss worldwide, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis.Lancet Glob. Health. 2013; 1: e339-e349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). These important aspects of human retinal function and dysfunction cannot be satisfactorily studied in more accessible model organisms, including mice, because they lack a fovea. Basic aspects of retinal structure and function are shared by all retinal regions in all vertebrate species (Figure 1B). Photoreceptors (PRs; rods and cones) convert light into electrical signals, which are transferred to interneurons (HCs, horizontal cells; BCs, bipolar cells; ACs, amacrine cells). Interneurons process the information and deliver it to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send axons through the optic nerve to the rest of the brain (Masland, 2012Masland R.H. The neuronal organization of the retina.Neuron. 2012; 76: 266-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Selective connectivity among multiple AC, BC, and RGC types, along with type-specific intrinsic differences, make each RGC type responsive to specific visual features (Gollisch and Meister, 2010Gollisch T. Meister M. Eye smarter than scientists believed: neural computations in circuits of the retina.Neuron. 2010; 65: 150-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Despite this conserved plan, however, the fovea and peripheral retina differ in many ways (Bringmann et al., 2018Bringmann A. Syrbe S. Görner K. Kacza J. Francke M. Wiedemann P. Reichenbach A. The primate fovea: Structure, function and development.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2018; 66: 49-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For example, many RGCs in the fovea are supplied by a single PR, which maximizes acuity, whereas peripheral RGCs are supplied by dozens to hundreds of PRs, enhancing sensitivity (Figure S1A). In addition, the fovea is rich in cones, which mediate color vision in well-lit conditions, whereas peripheral retina is dominated by rods, which function in dim light, further enhancing sensitivity (night vision). Cell types in the two regions also exhibit distinct morphologies and physiological functions (Figure S1A) (Greeff, 1900Greeff, R. (1900). Die mikroskopische anatomie des sehner ven und der netzhaut. In Handbuch der gesamten Augenheilkunde 1.Google Scholar, Kolb and Marshak, 2003Kolb H. Marshak D. The midget pathways of the primate retina.Doc.

Because molecular information is lacking for most primate retinal cell types and genetic access is limited, the underpinnings of these differences are little explored. Lack of molecular knowledge has also precluded assessment of the conservation of retinal cell types between primates and more widely used model organisms. Identification of orthologous cell types is challenging in the absence of such knowledge. The five retinal neuronal classes (PRs, HCs, BCs, ACs, and RGCs) are divided into >120 types in mice and ∼60 in primates, but the extent of their correspondence is unclear (e.g., Sanes and Masland, 2015Sanes J.R. Masland R.H. The types of retinal ganglion cells: current status and implications for neuronal classification.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 38: 221-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Masri et al., 2019Masri R.A. Percival K.A. Koizumi A. Martin P.R. Grünert U. Survey of retinal ganglion cell morphology in marmoset.J. Comp. Neurol. 2019; 527: 236-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Molecular characterization could provide a lingua franca to enable mapping, informing relationships between common model organisms and primates. To address these issues, we generated an atlas of >165,000 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles from the fovea and peripheral retina of adult crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis), a widely used primate model in vision studies (Figure S1B). We identified and molecularly characterized >60 cell types in each region, and validated many by them by pairing molecular markers with cell morphology. We then compared the fovea and periphery, showing that most types are shared by the two regions, but exhibit marked region-specific differences in proportions and expression programs. Next, we compared macaque and mouse retinal cell types. We found a tight correspondence between mouse and macaque PRs, BCs, and ACs, but a divergence in RGC types. Key macaque types and molecular features are also conserved in marmosets and humans. Finally, we used our atlas to determine the cell- and region-specific expression of >190 genes implicated in 7 complex diseases that cause human blindness, demonstrating striking patterns of region- and cell-type-specific expression. Overall, our study provides a general framework for using molecularly derived taxonomies of cell types to understand regional and species specializations in the nervous system and other organs. We generated cell atlases of foveal and peripheral regions of M. fascicularis retina using droplet-based scRNA-seq (Zheng et al., 2017Zheng G.X. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. Ziraldo S.B. Wheeler T.D. McDermott G.P. Zhu J. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2343) Google Scholar) (STAR Methods), yielding high-quality cell profiles from 92,628 foveal and 73,053 peripheral cells (Table S1). For foveal samples, cells were dissociated from 0.5–1.5 mm diameter pieces and profiled without further processing. Because ∼80% of total cells in peripheral retina are rod PRs, we depleted rods (CD73+) or enriched RGCs (CD90+) from peripheral samples before profiling (Figure S1B and STAR Methods). In parallel, we assembled a retina-specific transcriptome, which substantially improved the mapping of scRNA-seq reads compared to existing references (Figures S1C–S1E), emphasizing the importance of high-quality tissue-specific transcriptome for scRNA-seq analyses. To maximize our ability to distinguish cell types consistently, we first grouped cells into the six major retinal classes (RGCs, BCs, PRs, ACs, HCs, and non-neuronal cells) based on known class-specific gene signatures (Figures 1C and S1F and Table S1) and then iteratively clustered cells within each class separately, building on our earlier methods (Shekhar et al., 2016Shekhar K. Lapan S.W. Whitney I.E. Tran N.M. Macosko E.Z. Kowalczyk M. Adiconis X. Levin J.Z. Nemesh J. Goldman M. et al.Comprehensive Classification of Retinal Bipolar Neurons by Single-Cell Transcriptomics.Cell. 2016; 166: 1308-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Altogether, we distinguished 64 foveal (3 PR, 2 HC, 12 BC, 27 AC, 16 RGC, and 4 non-neuronal) and 71 peripheral (2 PR, 2 HC, 11 BC, 34 AC, 18 RGC, and 4 non-neuronal) clusters (Figures 1D–1I); all clusters were found in all animals (Figures S1G–S1I). As noted below, a few clusters contain >1 cell type. Non-neuronal cells were Müller glia, pericytes, endothelial cells, and microglia (Figure 1I). There are no oligodendrocytes in healthy retina, and astrocytes were not recovered in our samples. Using differential expression analysis, we identified molecular markers for each cluster and used this information to assign clusters to individual cell types. We first describe the types and then return to differences between fovea and periphery. Retinas of trichromatic primates, including macaques and humans, contain rods plus three cone types that preferentially detect long (L; red), medium (M; green), and short (S; blue) wavelengths, because of their expression of L, M and S opsins (OPN1LW, OPN1MW, OPN1SW) respectively. S cones were readily distinguished, whereas M and L cones mapped to a single cluster (Figure 1D). OPN1MW and OPN1LW have ∼98% identical coding sequences (Onishi et al., 2002Onishi A. Koike S. Ida-Hosonuma M. Imai H. Shichida Y. Takenaka O. Hanazawa A. Komatsu H. Mikami A. Goto S. et al.Variations in long- and middle-wavelength-sensitive opsin gene loci in crab-eating monkeys.Vision Res. 2002; 42: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and are not distinguished in the macaque reference genome. We therefore retrieved exons that distinguish the two opsins from ∼70% of the M/L cones and used them to evaluate M- and L-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Figures S2A–S2C and S2E). Of these, >96% from both fovea and periphery exhibited exclusive L or M SNPs (Figure S2B, S2C, and S2E). Remarkably, no genes other than OPN1MW or OPN1LW were differentially expressed (DE) between M and L cones (Figures 2A and S2D), supporting a model in which stochastic choice between the neighboring OPN1MW and OPN1LW genes diversifies otherwise identical cones (Wang et al., 1999Wang Y. Smallwood P.M. Cowan M. Blesh D. Lawler A. Nathans J. Mutually exclusive expression of human red and green visual pigment-reporter transgenes occurs at high frequency in murine cone photoreceptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 5251-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In contrast, many genes distinguished M/L from S cones and rods and S cones from rods (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2F). BCs, the major excitatory interneurons of the retina, are divided into those that receive predominant input from cones or rods; cone BCs are further divided into those excited (ON BCs) or inhibited (OFF BCs) by light (Euler et al., 2014Euler T. Haverkamp S. Schubert T. Baden T. Retinal bipolar cells: elementary building blocks of vision.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). 12 BC types (1 rod, 5 OFF cone, and 6 ON cone) have been previously reported in macaque peripheral retina based on morphology and immunohistochemistry (Grünert et al., 1994Grünert U.

We identified 12 foveal BC and 11 peripheral BC clusters; 10 mapped 1:1 to known types (Table S2), and supervised methods separated another cluster into two known types (Figure S2H). The additional foveal cluster appears to be a previously unreported OFF type, which we call OFFx (Figure S2I). We identified markers for each BC type and validated several of them (Figures 2D, 2E, S2G, and S2J–S2O). HCs and ACs are the main sources of inhibitory input to retinal circuitry. We identified two clusters of HCs in both fovea and periphery (Figure 1E) and mapped them to distinct HC subsets in tissue. We also validated SPP1 (osteopontin) as a pan-HC marker (Figure S5D). We identified 27 foveal and 34 peripheral AC clusters, including both GABAergic and glycinergic subclasses (Figures 1G, S4A, and S5E and Table S2). We assigned six clusters to known mouse types based on their expression of orthologous markers (Figures S4A and S5E). Neuropeptides were expressed in subsets of GABAergic AC types (Table S2). Morphological studies have distinguished ∼18 RGC types in primate retina (Dacey, 2004Dacey D.M.

Neurol. 2019; 527: 236-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ON and OFF Midget RGCs (MGCs)—the smallest and most abundant—comprise ≥85% of foveal RGCs, larger ON and OFF parasol RGCs (PGCs) comprise ∼10%, small bistratified RGCs (SBCs) account for ∼5%, and ∼11 types with larger dendritic arbors account for the remaining ∼1%. MGCs and PGCs also account for a large majority of peripheral RGCs (Dacey, 2004Dacey D.M. Origins of perception: retinal ganglion cell diversity and the creation of parallel visual pathways.in: Gazzaniga M.S. The Cognitive Neurosciences. Third Edition. MIT Press, Cambridge2004: 281-301Google Scholar). We identified 18 peripheral and 16 foveal RGC clusters (Figure 1H). Based on their abundance, we tentatively identified a pair of clusters as ON and OFF MGCs (∼85% of RGCs in fovea and 83% in periphery) and a second pair as ON and OFF PGCs (11% in fovea and 4.8% in periphery). Markers for these types include TBR1 (OFF MGC), TPBG (ON MGC), CHRNA2 (ON PGC), and CA8 (OFF PGC). SPP1 and RBPMS2 are expressed by both PGC types and GUCY1A3 by both MGC types (Figures 2F and S3C–S3O). We confirmed the identities of these four RGC types by combining fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with viral labeling to visualize morphology (Figures 2G, S3B, S3P, and S3Q). Interestingly, RGC somata expressing transcription factors (TFs) selective for ON and OFF MGCs and PGCs were segregated into outer and inner halves of GCL, suggesting a molecular basis for the laminar organization of physiologically distinct subclasses (Perry and Silveira, 1988Perry V.H. Silveira L.C. Functional lamination in the ganglion cell layer of the macaque’s retina.Neuroscience. 1988; 25: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Figures 2H and S3P). We were unable to further partition MGCs and PGCs by supervised methods. Three peripheral RGC clusters expressed OPN4 (melanopsin), a marker of intrinsically photosensitive RGCs (ipRGCs). We identified markers for the remaining clusters, including SATB2 as a marker for SBCs (Figures 2I and S3A). To our knowledge, these are the first molecular markers for the major RGC types of the primate retina. To relate foveal and peripheral clusters based on gene expression, we devised a multi-class learning framework that associated each foveal cell with a peripheral identity and then examined the extent to which clusters across the two regions corresponded (STAR Methods). Most foveal clusters (77%) mapped 1:1 with peripheral clusters, including 10/12 BC, 2/2 HC, 20/27 AC, and 14/16 RGC clusters (Figures 3A–3D). These matches were statistically significant as quantified by the adjusted Rand index (ARI), a measure of similarity between data clusterings. Six foveal clusters (RGC clusters fRGC11,14 and AC clusters fGa3,7,13 and fGl8) could be partitioned because they each mapped to two closely related peripheral clusters. Most instances of multi-mapping were for AC clusters, likely due to a biased frequency distribution in the peripheral samples, which were not optimized for AC recovery (Figure S4B).Figure S4Differences in Proportions of Cell Types and Gene Expression between the Fovea and Peripheral Retina, Related to Figures 3, 4Show full captionA.

Comparison of frequencies of matched AC types between the foveal (x axis) and peripheral datasets (y axis). To facilitate comparison, we assigned each foveal AC a peripheral identity based on Figure 3C and then compare frequencies of 1:1 matched types. The peripheral ACs are subdivided into those originating from CD90+ samples (upper) and CD73- samples (lower). Values are plotted on a ln-ln scale to highlight low frequency types. The poor correlation of the AC types in the CD90+ sample with the fovea suggests a biased labeling of AC types by this marker. Hence, we only used AC cluster frequencies in the CD73- samples, which show a much higher correlation to the foveal frequencies, to compute compositional similarities between the fovea and the periphery.C.

Comparison of frequencies of matched AC types between the foveal (x axis) and peripheral datasets (y axis). To facilitate comparison, we assigned each foveal AC a peripheral identity based on Figure 3C and then compare frequencies of 1:1 matched types. The peripheral ACs are subdivided into those originating from CD90+ samples (upper) and CD73- samples (lower). Values are plotted on a ln-ln scale to highlight low frequency types. The poor correlation of the AC types in the CD90+ sample with the fovea suggests a biased labeling of AC types by this marker. Hence, we only used AC cluster frequencies in the CD73- samples, which show a much higher correlation to the foveal frequencies, to compute compositional similarities between the fovea and the periphery.

To accomplish this goal, we have developed cell culture conditions to closely mimic events occurring during pancreatic islet organogenesis and β cell maturation. In particular, we have focused on recapitulating endocrine cell clustering by isolating and reaggregating immature β-like cells to form islet-sized enriched β-clusters (eBCs). eBCs display physiological properties analogous to primary human β cells, including robust dynamic insulin secretion, increased calcium signalling in response to secretagogues, and improved mitochondrial energization. Notably, endocrine cell clustering induces metabolic maturation by driving mitochondrial oxidative respiration, a process central to stimulus–secretion coupling in mature β cells. eBCs display glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as early as three days after transplantation in mice. In summary, replicating aspects of endocrine cell clustering permits the generation of stem-cell-derived β cells that resemble their endogenous counterparts. Nair et al. report the generation of human ESC-derived mature and functional β cells in vitro with a culture system including a step to induce clustering of immature β-like cells."

We resolved transcriptional changes during enteroendocrine differentiation in real time at single-cell level using a novel knockin allele of Neurog3, the master regulator gene briefly expressed at the onset of enteroendocrine specification. A bi-fluorescent reporter, Neurog3Chrono, measures time from the onset of enteroendocrine differentiation and enables precise positioning of single-cell transcriptomes along an absolute time axis. This approach yielded a definitive description of the enteroendocrine hierarchy and its sub-lineages, uncovered differential kinetics between sub-lineages, and revealed time-dependent hormonal plasticity in enterochromaffin and L cells. The time-resolved map of transcriptional changes predicted multiple novel molecular regulators. Nine of these were validated by conditional knockout in mice or CRISPR modification in intestinal organoids. Six novel candidate regulators (Sox4, Rfx6, Tox3, Myt1, Runx1t1, and Zcchc12) yielded specific enteroendocrine phenotypes. Our time-resolved single-cell transcriptional map presents a rich resource to unravel enteroendocrine differentiation."

Here, we uncovered spatial compartmentalization of skin-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and modulation of sebaceous glands by a subset of RORγt+ ILCs residing within hair follicles in close proximity to sebaceous glands. Their persistence in skin required IL-7 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and localization was dependent on the chemokine receptor CCR6. ILC subsets expressed TNF receptor ligands, which limited sebocyte growth by repressing Notch signaling pathway. Consequently, loss of ILCs resulted in sebaceous hyperplasia with increased production of antimicrobial lipids and restricted commensalism of Gram-positive bacterial communities.

Thus, epithelia-derived signals maintain skin-resident ILCs that regulate microbial commensalism through sebaceous gland-mediated tuning of the barrier surface, highlighting an immune-epithelia circuitry that facilitates host-microbe symbiosis. Mammalian barrier surfaces are inhabited by a variety of microorganisms that have developed symbiotic relationships. Evolutionary pressure has led to the sophistication of barrier systems that, together with the immune system, have co-evolved to form an alliance both to protect against pathogens and to ensure host-microbe symbiosis. Despite the importance of microbiota in both physiological and pathological states (Honda and Littman, 2016Honda K. Littman D.R. The microbiota in adaptive immune homeostasis and disease.Nature. 2016; 535: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), the specific mechanisms involved in crosstalk between epithelia and the immune system that achieve sustainable tuning of microbial equilibrium remain elusive. Mammalian skin is the body’s outermost barrier that provides protection against trauma, thermal changes, and external agents, including microbes. Skin fulfills its barrier functions through its multiple layers, which consist of three different anatomical compartments: epidermis, dermis, and subcutis. Each of these layers has distinct morphological and physiological functions. Epidermis, the outer most layer of skin, requires the highest barrier stringency because of its constant exposure to external stimuli and microbial challenges, providing the first line of physical and immunological defense. Epidermis is a sophisticated composition of structures, including hair follicles, a defining feature of mammals. Hair follicles are equipped with sebaceous glands and by producing sebum, a complex formation of lipids, tune the skin surface barrier. Skin is home to a vast number of resident innate and adaptive immune cells with tissue-specialized functions, potentially including many that have not yet been elucidated. These immune cells add another layer of functional complexity to the skin barrier system (Nestle et al., 2009Nestle F.O. Di Meglio P. Qin J.Z. Nickoloff B.J. Skin immune sentinels in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that elicit antimicrobial immune responses have been extensively studied in the past. However, it is not clear whether skin-resident immune cells are constitutively involved in barrier homeostasis and how they collaborate with epithelial cells to effectively maintain the balance of skin microbiota. Recent identification of an innate arm of the lymphoid lineage referred to as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) (Spits et al., 2013Spits H. Artis D. Colonna M. Diefenbach A. Di Santo J.P. Eberl G. Koyasu S. Locksley R.M. McKenzie A.N. Mebius R.E. et al.Innate lymphoid cells--a proposal for uniform nomenclature.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) has prompted a fundamental reassessment of the roles of innate immunity in pathogen defense and tissue homeostasis. In contrast to T lymphocytes, ILCs lack the T cell receptor and become activated in an antigen-independent manner in response to tissue-derived signals in a perturbed microenvironment. ILCs display a wide range of effector functions and consist of three functionally distinct groups: termed ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, which are defined by transcription factors and effector molecules that they express (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A. Colonna M. Koyasu S. Development, differentiation, and diversity of innate lymphoid cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 354-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). ILCs modulate epithelial cell function by producing cytokines and growth factors that promote barrier function and expulsion of pathogens (Klose and Artis, 2016Klose C.S. Artis D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) (McKenzie et al., 2014McKenzie A.N.J. Spits H. Eberl G. Innate lymphoid cells in inflammation and immunity.Immunity. 2014; 41: 366-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although the roles of ILCs have been extensively investigated in recent years in the contexts of infection and inflammation, their roles in regulating barrier homeostasis and balancing microbial ecology remain unexplored. Here, we uncover a role of skin-resident ILCs in the regulation of barrier homeostasis and the microbiota. Previous studies have targeted specific groups of skin ILCs and their functions during immune responses, but the detailed landscape of ILC subsets is unclear. By immunophenotyping, as well as transcriptome and regulome profiling, we determined a high degree of compartmentalization of ILCs with distinct characteristics in different anatomical layers of skin. Positioning and skin-residency of ILCs require epithelia-derived chemokines and cytokines. Identification of a unique population of RORγt+ ILCs around hair follicles in close proximity to sebaceous glands led us to focus on the role of ILCs in the regulation of sebaceous function. Remarkably, the lack of skin ILCs resulted in sebaceous hyperplasia with excessive production of an antimicrobial free fatty acid leading to restricted commensalism of Gram-positive bacterial communities. Subsets of ILCs expressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxins, both of which restricted sebocyte growth and repressed Notch signaling, revealing an epithelia-immune circuitry in the homeostatic regulation of skin barrier systems. Thus, our data provide evidence of a previously unrecognized epithelia-immune alliance for sustaining microbial equilibrium. To investigate the identities and characteristics of ILCs in different anatomical skin layers, epidermis, dermis, and subcutis were separately isolated from the skin of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Flow cytometry analysis of each layer revealed distinct populations that expressed Thy1.2 but lacked expression of lymphoid- and myeloid-lineage markers (Lin−) (Figure 1A). These Lin− Thy1.2+ cells persisted in T and B lymphocyte-deficient Rag2−/− mice but were eradicated in Rag2−/− Il2rg−/− mice. All Lin− Thy1.2+ cells from each skin layer displayed a typical lymphoid morphology with a high nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio (Figure 1B) and expressed IL-7Rα (Figure S1A), of which downstream signaling is critical for ILC development (Diefenbach et al., 2014Diefenbach A. Colonna M. Koyasu S. Development, differentiation, and diversity of innate lymphoid cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 354-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). These data demonstrated that the Lin− Thy1.2+ cells were bona fide ILCs.Figure S1Characterization of Skin ILCs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Flow cytometry analysis showing expression of indicated cell surface proteins on ILCs (live CD45+, Lin−, Thy1.2+) from the epidermis, dermis and subcutis of WT mice.

Distinct cell surface phenotypes were observed in ILCs of different compartments. In particular, ILCs in the epidermis and dermis could be distinguished from those in the subcutis by their expression of inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) and lack of ILC2 markers KLRG1, IL-2Rα, and IL-33R (Klose and Artis, 2016Klose C.S. Artis D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), all of which were distinctively expressed on ILCs in subcutis (Figures 1C and S1A). Another ILC2 marker, Sca-1 (Moro et al., 2010Moro K. Yamada T. Tanabe M. Takeuchi T. Ikawa T. Kawamoto H. Furusawa J. Ohtani M. Fujii H. Koyasu S. Innate production of T(H)2 cytokines by adipose tissue-associated c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) lymphoid cells.Nature. 2010; 463: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), was uniformly expressed by ILCs in subcutis, but only a subset of dermal ILCs expressed this marker (Figure S1A). Epidermal ILCs were distinguishable from dermal ILCs by their high expression of Thy1.2 and their uniform expression of CD103, a binding partner of E-cadherin which promotes tissue-residency of immune cells (Figure S1A). In contrast to subsets of gut ILCs that regulate T cell responses against gut microbes (Hepworth et al., 2015Hepworth M.R. Fung T.C. Masur S.H. Kelsen J.R. McConnell F.M. Dubrot J. Withers D.R. Hugues S. Farrar M.A. Reith W. et al.Immune tolerance. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells mediate intestinal selection of commensal bacteria-specific CD4+ T cells.Science. 2015; 348: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), none of the skin ILC subsets clearly expressed MHC class II (Figure S1A). ILC subsets are known for their signature cytokine production during execution of effector functions (Sonnenberg and Artis, 2015Sonnenberg G.F. Artis D. Innate lymphoid cells in the initiation, regulation and resolution of inflammation.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 698-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) (Klose and Artis, 2016Klose C.S. Artis D. Innate lymphoid cells as regulators of immunity, inflammation and tissue homeostasis.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The majority of subcutaneous ILCs produced IL-5 and IL-13 upon PMA and ionomycin stimulation (Figure 1D). Taken together with their cell surface phenotype, subcutaneous ILCs were consistent with ILC2s. Dermal ILCs consisted of heterogeneous populations including IL-5- and IL-13-producing ILC2s and IL-17A-producing ILC3s. Interestingly and in contrast to other skin ILC subsets, epidermal ILCs only minimally produced IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17A upon PMA and ionomycin stimulation (Figure 1D). To better characterize skin ILC subsets, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted Lin− Thy1.2+ ILCs from each skin compartment. Dermal ILCs that were discernible by the expression of CCR6 and Sca-1 were individually analyzed. Principal-component analysis revealed distinct tissue-specific signatures among skin ILCs (Figure 1E) with 3,078 differentially expressed genes (DEG; fold change > 2 and p-value < 0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of DEGs revealed that epidermal and subcutaneous ILCs were most distant and that CCR6+ and Sca-1+ dermal ILCs shared features with epidermal and subcutaneous ILCs, respectively (Figure 1F and Figure S1B). Consistent with their cytokine profiles (Figure 1D), subcutaneous ILCs were highly enriched in ILC2-signature genes (Gury-BenAri et al., 2016Gury-BenAri M. Thaiss C.A. Serafini N. Winter D.R. Giladi A. Lara-Astiaso D. Levy M. Salame T.M. Weiner A. David E. et al.The Spectrum and Regulatory Landscape of Intestinal Innate Lymphoid Cells Are Shaped by the Microbiome.Cell. 2016; 166: 1231-1246.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) (Figure 1F). While epidermal ILCs exhibited gene expression profiles that suggested an ILC3 signature, which included they key transcription factor Rorc (Gury-BenAri et al., 2016Gury-BenAri M. Thaiss C.A. Serafini N. Winter D.R. Giladi A. Lara-Astiaso D. Levy M. Salame T.M. Weiner A. David E. et al.The Spectrum and Regulatory Landscape of Intestinal Innate Lymphoid Cells Are Shaped by the Microbiome.Cell. 2016; 166: 1231-1246.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), they also expressed genes that have been associated with ILC2s, such as Il2, Hlf, and Il13 (Figure 1F). None of the skin ILCs expressed NK cell- and ILC1-related genes such as Tbx21, Eomes, Ifng, and Il15ra (data not shown). Collectively, in contrast to the typical ILC2 signature in subcutis ILCs, epidermal ILCs exhibited an ILC3 signature with skin-specific transcriptome features. Chromatin accessibility reveals transcriptional programs that are more stable over time and thus reflects developmental and functional constraints (Shih et al., 2016Shih H.Y. Sciumè G. Mikami Y. Guo L. Sun H.W. Brooks S.R. Urban Jr., J.F. Davis F.P. Kanno Y. O’Shea J.J. Developmental Acquisition of Regulomes Underlies Innate Lymphoid Cell Functionality.Cell. 2016; 165: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed skin ILC via Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to gain more insight into regulatory elements that shape skin ILC identities. ATAC-seq revealed distinct and similar patterns among skin ILCs subsets (Figure 1G, Figure S1C). Among 20,869 accessible regulatory elements in total, approximately 40% of the accessible regions were common to all skin ILC subsets, suggesting that core regulatory machinery is conserved among skin ILCs (Figure 1G). The remaining 60% of the regions were either unique to, or overlapped between, certain subsets of ILCs. We further investigated enrichment of transcription factor motifs in regulatory elements and identified distinct motif signatures, which included enrichment of ILC2- and ILC3-defined transcription factors, as well as previously reported ILC signature-motifs (Shih et al., 2016Shih H.Y. Sciumè G. Mikami Y. Guo L. Sun H.W. Brooks S.R. Urban Jr., J.F. Davis F.P. Kanno Y. O’Shea J.J. Developmental Acquisition of Regulomes Underlies Innate Lymphoid Cell Functionality.Cell. 2016; 165: 1120-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Transcription factor motifs that have been associated with an ILC2 signature were enriched in subcutaneous ILCs. In contrast, enrichment of ILC3-signature motifs including RORγt, Tcf3, and Tcf4 were prominent in epidermal ILCs (Figure 1H). To explore the heterogeneity of skin ILCs, we sorted Lin− Thy1.2+ ILCs from each skin layer and performed single-cell RNA-seq (Figure 2A). We analyzed 3,431; 3,356; and 1,061 ILCs from epidermis, dermis, and subcutis, respectively. Unsupervised clustering of the combined dataset performed in Seurat identified 6 distinct ILC clusters (Figure 2B). ILCs from each skin layer segregated (Figure 2B), further highlighting layer-specific transcriptomic profiles of ILCs. In contrast to the uniformity of subcutaneous ILCs, epidermal and dermal ILCs each formed two clusters (Figure 2B). Gata3 and Rora, key transcription factors for ILC2, were highly expressed by dermal and subcutaneous ILC clusters 3 and 5, respectively (Figure 2C). Cells expressing Rorc were enriched in epidermal ILC clusters. Tbx21, a transcription factor expressed by ILC1, was undetected. An unsupervised heatmap revealed signature genes in individual clusters (Figure 2D). Subcutaneous ILC cluster 5 showed ILC2 transcriptome identities, represented by the expression of Il5, Il1rl1, Arg1, and others. DEGs were observed between dermal ILC clusters 3 and 4, and Metascape analysis identified pathways involved in regulation of protein phosphorylation, hemopoiesis, and cell death in dermal ILC cluster 4, suggesting that expression of genes underlying distinct cellular activities delineated it from cluster 3 (Figure 2E). Both epidermal ILC clusters 1 and 2 expressed high levels of Ptprcap, Ctsw, Lck, Capg, Ly6g5b, Ccr6, and Itgae. Epidermal ILC cluster 2, in comparison to cluster 1, was characterized by the higher expression of Cd70, Ltb, Bcl2a1d, Cd83, Tff1, and Ramp1. Epidermal ILC cluster 2 displayed enrichment of pathways involved in cytokine production, cytokine receptor interaction, and cytokine signaling, suggesting differential activation states between the two epidermal ILC clusters (Figure 2E). ILCs respond to various tissue-derived signals. To identify cytokines that activate skin ILCs, we examined mRNA expression of cytokine receptors that have been reported to be expressed by ILCs. We found layer specific patterns of receptor expression. As expected for an ILC2 subset, Il1rl1 (encoding an IL-33 receptor subunit) and Il2ra were expressed by subcutaneous ILCs (Figure 2F). In contrast, epidermal and dermal ILCs highly expressed Il18r1, consistent with a recent finding (Ricardo-Gonzalez et al., 2018Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R. Van Dyken S.J. Schneider C. Lee J. Nussbaum J.C. Liang H.E. Vaka D. Eckalbar W.L. Molofsky A.B. Erle D.J. Locksley R.M. Tissue signals imprint ILC2 identity with anticipatory function.Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). While Il17rb (encoding IL-25R) expression was enriched in epidermal and dermal ILC clusters, all skin ILCs expressed Crlf2 (encoding the TSLP receptor subunit) and Tnfrsf25 (encoding DR3). Il23r and Il1r1 (encoding IL-1R subunit) were minimally expressed. Consistent with their receptor expression profiles, epidermal and dermal ILCs proliferated in vitro in the presence of IL-18, while IL-33 promoted the proliferation of subcutaneous ILCs (Figure 2G). Collectively, these results establish that distinct tissue-derived signals differentially drove skin ILC proliferation and that skin ILCs exhibited unique transcriptome and regulome landscapes with a high degree of compartmentalization and layer-specific identities. Differentiation and functions of ILCs are determined by the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, including GATA3 for ILC2s and RORγt for ILC3s (Fang and Zhu, 2017Fang D. Zhu J. Dynamic balance between master transcription factors determines the fates and functions of CD4 T cell and innate lymphoid cell subsets.J. Exp. Med. 2017; 214: 1861-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry confirmed the expression of GATA3 by subcutaneous ILCs and the co-expression of RORγt and GATA3 by epidermal ILCs (Figure S2A). The fate-mapping of Rorc-expressing cells demonstrated that, in spite of Gata3 expression, epidermal ILC were distinct from subcutaneous ILC2s and was more related to the RORγt+ ILC3 lineage (Figure S2B). Consistently, induced ablation of Gata3 in Gata3fl/fl Cre-ERT2 mice (Yagi et al., 2014Yagi R. Zhong C. Northrup D.L. Yu F. Bouladoux N. Spencer S. Hu G. Barron L. Sharma S.

To determine if GATA3 was required for skin ILCs to gain effector functions, we utilized a skin inflammation model, in which topical application of the vitamin D3 analog, MC903 (calcipotriol), induces atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin inflammation with expansion of skin ILCs (Kim et al., 2013Kim B.S. Siracusa M.C. Saenz S.A. Noti M. Monticelli L.A. Sonnenberg G.F. Hepworth M.R. Van Voorhees A.S. Comeau M.R. Artis D. TSLP elicits IL-33-independent innate lymphoid cell responses to promote skin inflammation.Sci. Transl. Med. 2013; 5: 170ra16Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) (Salimi et al., 2013Salimi M. Barlow J.L. Saunders S.P. Xue L. Gutowska-Owsiak D. Wang X. Huang L.C. Johnson D. Scanlon S.T. McKenzie A.N. et al.A role for IL-25 and IL-33-driven type-2 innate lymphoid cells in atopic dermatitis.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In contrast to increases of all skin ILCs after MC903 application in control mice, ILCs failed to expand in GATA3-depleted mice (Figure S2D). Moreover, all skin ILCs exhibited impaired IL-13 and IL-17A production in GATA3-depleted mice, resulting in attenuated skin inflammation (Figures S2E and S2F). These data indicated that GATA3 was required for triggering effector programs in skin ILCs under inflammatory conditions, in line with the current understanding that GATA3 regulates the maintenance and functions of ILC3s (Zhong et al., 2016Zhong C. Cui K. Wilhelm C. Hu G. Mao K. Belkaid Y. Zhao K. Zhu J. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells continuously require the transcription factor GATA-3 after commitment.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We further examined RORγt-deficient mice (RorcGFP/GFP). Despite the expression of RORγt and other ILC3-related transcriptomic features, the numbers of ILCs in the epidermis and dermis was unaffected (Figure S2G). IL-17A production by epidermal and dermal ILCs was impaired, and skin inflammation was reduced in MC903-treated RorcGFP/GFP mice (Figures S2H and S2I). These results indicated that RORγt was dispensable for the development of epidermal ILCs during steady state but was required to gain effector functions during inflammation. Taken together, GATA3 and RORγt differentially contributed to the homeostatic maintenance of ILCs and drove effector programs that mediated AD-like skin inflammation. It has become clear over recent years that resident immune cells in different organs play crucial roles in host-protective immunity and in immune-mediated diseases. While ILCs in the gut and lung are reported to be tissue-resident (Gasteiger et al., 2015Gasteiger G. Fan X. Dikiy S. Lee S.Y. Rudensky A.Y. Tissue residency of innate lymphoid cells in lymphoid and nonlymphoid organs.Science. 2015; 350: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) (Moro et al., 2016Moro K. Kabata H. Tanabe M. Koga S. Takeno N. Mochizuki M. Fukunaga K. Asano K. Betsuyaku T. Koyasu S. Interferon and IL-27 antagonize the function of group 2 innate lymphoid cells and type 2 innate immune responses.Nat. Immunol. 2016; 17: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), whether skin ILCs are tissue-resident and whether they retain tissue residency under inflammation has yet to be determined. To first study the persistence of skin ILCs, we generated doxycycline-inducible GFP mice (H2B-GFP;R26-M2rtTA). Like αβ T cells, over 60% of skin ILCs lost GFP expression 8 weeks after induction, while the majority of epidermal γδ T cells retained GFP (Figures 3A and S3), demonstrating distinctive turnover rates among skin lymphoid subsets. We also assessed cell proliferation by treating wild-type mice with Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 7 days. Negligible numbers of γδ T cells were labeled with BrdU after 7 days, while 2%–4% of ILCs incorporated BrdU (Figure 3B). Collectively, these results demonstrated a fast turnover of ILCs relative to epidermal γδ T cells.Figure S3Turnover of Skin ILCs, Related to Figure 3Show full captionFlow cytometry of H2B-GFP;R26-M2rtTA mice that were treated with doxycycline for 6 days.

Proportions of GFP+ cells in ILCs from the epidermis, dermis and subcutis and epidermal γδ T cells at indicated time points are shown. Further highlighting distinct properties of skin lymphoid subsets, γδ T cells were highly radio-resistant in bone marrow chimeric mice that were transplanted with congenic bone marrow (CD45.1 → CD45.2), whereas the majority of ILCs were replaced by donor-bone marrow (Figure 3C). To determine if ILCs were maintained locally in skin, we generated parabiotic mice, wherein CD45.1+ and CD45.2+ congenic mice were surgically connected to share blood circulation. We found over 90% of ILCs in all three skin layers to be of host origin, whereas approximately 40% of αβ T cells in skin were replenished by donor-derived cells (Figure 3D), indicating that the vast majority of ILCs were locally maintained in skin during steady state, independent of circulating precursors. To further test whether tissue-residency was maintained under inflammation, we treated parabiotic mice with MC903. While a minor contribution of donor-derived cells (<5%) was detected in the expanded ILCs, the majority of expanded ILCs during inflammation remained of host origin in all skin layers (Figure 3E). These data established that expansion of ILCs was supported by local proliferation of resident ILCs, with only a minor contribution of circulating or bone marrow-derived progenitors. Thus, skin ILCs are bona fide tissue-resident immune cells under steady-state and inflammatory conditions. Residency of immune cells is likely mediated by mutual stroma-immune crosstalk, which may involve distinct tissue-specific mechanisms. In skin, resident immune cells, such as Langerhans cells and αβ memory T cells, rely on hair follicle-derived chemokines and cytokines to maintain their residency (Nagao et al., 2012Nagao K. Kobayashi T. Moro K. Ohyama M. Adachi T. Kitashima D.Y. Ueha S. Horiuchi K. Tanizaki H.

The complete absence of ILCs in all 3 layers of skin in Il7r−/− mice indicated that IL-7Rα was crucial for skin ILC (Figure 4A).

Quantitative tests of this idea, however, require a theoretical framework capable of exposing the rules and precision of cell specification over developmental time. We use the gap gene network in the early fly embryo as an example to show how expression levels of the four gap genes can be jointly decoded into an optimal specification of position with 1% accuracy. The decoder correctly predicts, with no free parameters, the dynamics of pair-rule expression patterns at different developmental time points and in various mutant backgrounds. Precise cellular identities are thus available at the earliest stages of development, contrasting the prevailing view of positional information being slowly refined across successive layers of the patterning network. Our results suggest that developmental enhancers closely approximate a mathematically optimal decoding strategy."

Analysis of human melanoma biopsies revealed that amoeboid melanoma cells with high Myosin II activity are predominant in the invasive fronts of primary tumors in proximity to CD206+CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages and vessels. Proteomic analysis shows that ROCK-Myosin II activity in amoeboid cancer cells controls an immunomodulatory secretome, enabling the recruitment of monocytes and their differentiation into tumor-promoting macrophages. Both amoeboid cancer cells and their associated macrophages support an abnormal vasculature, which ultimately facilitates tumor progression. Mechanistically, amoeboid cancer cells perpetuate their behavior via ROCK-Myosin II-driven IL-1α secretion and NF-κB activation. Using an array of tumor models, we show that high Myosin II activity in tumor cells reprograms the innate immune microenvironment to support tumor growth. We describe an unexpected role for Myosin II dynamics in cancer cells controlling myeloid function via secreted factors."
https://openalex.org/W2914353810,"A large body of research shows that social isolation and loneliness have detrimental health consequences. Identifying individuals at risk of social isolation or loneliness is, therefore, important. The objective of this study was to examine personal (e.g., sex, income) and geographic (rural/urban and sociodemographic) factors and their association with social isolation and loneliness in a national sample of Canadians aged 45 to 85 years.The study involved cross-sectional analyses of baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging that were linked to 2016 census data at the Forward Sortation Area (FSA) level. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between personal factors and geographic factors and social isolation and loneliness for the total sample, and women and men, respectively.The prevalence of social isolation and loneliness was 5.1% and 10.2%, respectively, but varied substantially across personal characteristics. Personal characteristics (age, sex, education, income, functional impairment, chronic diseases) were significantly related to both social isolation and loneliness, although some differences emerged in the direction of the relationships for the two measures. Associations also differed somewhat for women versus men. Associations between some geographic factors emerged for social isolation, but not loneliness. Living in an urban core was related to increased odds of social isolation, an effect that was no longer significant when FSA-level factors were controlled for. FSAs with a higher percentage of 65+ year old residents with low income were consistently associated with higher odds of social isolation.The findings indicate that socially isolated individuals are, to some extent, clustered into areas with a high proportion of low-income older adults, suggesting that support and resources could be targeted at these areas. For loneliness, the focus may be less on where people live, but rather on personal characteristics that place individuals at risk."

In cells, levels of sphingomyelin/cholesterol complexes are held constant over a wide range of plasma membrane cholesterol concentrations, enabling precise regulation of the chemical activity of cholesterol. A special relationship between sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol in the plasma membranes (PMs) of animal cells has been proposed to modulate many cellular signaling processes (Simons and Ikonen, 1997Simons K. Ikonen E. Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8109) Google Scholar, Simons and Toomre, 2000Simons K. Toomre D. Lipid rafts and signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5155) Google Scholar). One such process is cholesterol homeostasis, which ensures optimal cholesterol levels in cellular membranes by precise regulation of its synthesis and uptake (Brown and Goldstein, 2009Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cholesterol feedback: from Schoenheimer’s bottle to Scap’s MELADL.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S15-S27Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). When cholesterol levels drop below a threshold set-point, transcription factors called SREBPs are activated and upregulate expression of cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes, which leads to increased cholesterol synthesis, and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which leads to increased uptake of exogenous cholesterol (Brown et al., 2018Brown M.S. Radhakrishnan A. Goldstein J.L. Retrospective on Cholesterol Homeostasis: The Central Role of Scap.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 783-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). As a result, cholesterol levels rise until an optimum concentration is reached, at which point SREBP activation is terminated and cholesterol synthesis and uptake declines. The PM contains ∼80% of total cellular cholesterol; however, SREBPs and the sensors that regulate SREBP activation are located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, which contains only ∼1% of total cellular cholesterol (Lange and Steck, 2016Lange Y. Steck T.L. Active membrane cholesterol as a physiological effector.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2016; 199: 74-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A carefully regulated lipid transport pathway between PM and ER allows cholesterol sensors in ER to monitor the cholesterol content of PM (Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Continuous transport of a small fraction of plasma membrane cholesterol to endoplasmic reticulum regulates total cellular cholesterol.eLife. 2017; 6: e25466Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Regulation of PM-to-ER cholesterol transport is determined by the organization of cholesterol in PMs, which critically depends on the interaction of cholesterol with SM (Simons and Ikonen, 2000Simons K. Ikonen E. How cells handle cholesterol.Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The link between SM levels and cholesterol synthesis was initially revealed by a pair of studies where (1) SM addition to cells increased cholesterol synthesis (Gatt and Bierman, 1980Gatt S. Bierman E.L. Sphingomyelin suppresses the binding and utilization of low density lipoproteins by skin fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3371-3376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and (2) SM removal from PMs of cells by treatment with sphingomyelinase (SMase), an enzyme that degrades SM, reduced cholesterol synthesis (Slotte and Bierman, 1988Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Depletion of plasma-membrane sphingomyelin rapidly alters the distribution of cholesterol between plasma membranes and intracellular cholesterol pools in cultured fibroblasts.Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Both of these effects were explained by a model where SM sequesters cholesterol in PMs, preventing cholesterol transport to ER membranes to shut down activation of SREBPs (Slotte et al., 1990Slotte J.P. Härmälä A.S. Jansson C. Pörn M.I. Rapid turn-over of plasma membrane sphingomyelin and cholesterol in baby hamster kidney cells after exposure to sphingomyelinase.Biochim. Biophys.

USA. 1997; 94: 11179-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Depletion of SM by SMase released some sequestered PM cholesterol, which then was free for transport to ER to shut down activation of SREBPs. More recently, we have quantified distinct pools of PM cholesterol using two soluble bacterial toxins, perfringolysin O (PFO) and anthrolysin O (ALO), which bind PM cholesterol when it is accessible at the membrane surface but not when it is rendered inaccessible due to sequestration by SM and other phospholipids (Das et al., 2014Das A.

Three pools of plasma membrane cholesterol and their relation to cholesterol homeostasis.eLife. 2014; 3: e02882Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Chakrabarti et al., 2017Chakrabarti R.S. Ingham S.A. Kozlitina J. Gay A. Cohen J.C. Radhakrishnan A. Hobbs H.H. Variability of cholesterol accessibility in human red blood cells measured using a bacterial cholesterol-binding toxin.eLife. 2017; 6: e23355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PM cholesterol is accessible to toxins only after the cholesterol concentration surpasses a threshold of 30–35 mole% of PM lipids (Das et al., 2013Das A. Goldstein J.L. Anderson D.D. Brown M.S. Radhakrishnan A. Use of mutant 125I-perfringolysin O to probe transport and organization of cholesterol in membranes of animal cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 10580-10585Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cholesterol in excess of this threshold is transported to ER to signal that the cholesterol requirements of the cell have been met and to terminate SREBP activation (Das et al., 2014Das A. Brown M.S. Anderson D.D. Goldstein J.L. Radhakrishnan A. Three pools of plasma membrane cholesterol and their relation to cholesterol homeostasis.eLife. 2014; 3: e02882Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017Infante R.E. Radhakrishnan A. Continuous transport of a small fraction of plasma membrane cholesterol to endoplasmic reticulum regulates total cellular cholesterol.eLife. 2017; 6: e25466Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). About half of the inaccessible cholesterol, ∼15 mole% of PM lipids, is sequestered by SM and can be liberated by treating cells with SMase. The remaining inaccessible PM cholesterol is sequestered by other membrane factors. Our understanding of the role of accessible PM cholesterol has steadily improved, but we know less about how inaccessible cholesterol is sequestered. Here, we focus on how SM sequesters PM cholesterol to make it inaccessible to sensors and cellular signaling processes. Our strategy for probing the SM/cholesterol interaction was based on previous success in identifying PFO and ALO as sensors for accessible, but not SM-sequestered, cholesterol. We speculated that there may be other toxins that have the opposite ability: to bind SM-sequestered but not accessible cholesterol. A literature search identified several candidate SM-binding toxins, some of which had been reported to also require cholesterol to bind membranes (Anderluh and Macek, 2002Anderluh G. Macek P.

We overexpressed and purified three toxins from this group, namely lysenin (Lys), equinatoxin II (Eqt), and ostreolysin A (OlyA), for analysis of their respective lipid specificities (Figure 1A). In these initial experiments, we used a version of SM containing a C16 ceramide base and an amide-linked oleoyl (18:1) acyl chain (18:1 SM; see Figure S1A). Pelleting assays showed that Lys and Eqt bound to liposomes containing SM, and their binding did not change in the presence of either cholesterol or epicholesterol, a diastereomer of cholesterol (Figures S1A and 1B, lanes 1–3). Binding was eliminated when SM was replaced with dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), another choline-containing phospholipid (Figures S1A and 1B, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, OlyA bound to membranes only when they contained both SM and cholesterol (Figure 1B, lanes 1–5). Thus, we focused on OlyA to gain insight into the SM/cholesterol interaction.Figure S1Chemical Structures of Lipids, Assay for OlyA-Mediated Hemolysis, and Fluorescent Labeling of OlyA Proteins, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Chemical structures of phospholipids and sterols used in this study.

We considered two models to explain the dual specificity of OlyA for SM and cholesterol in membranes. In one model, OlyA contains distinct binding sites for SM and cholesterol, respectively, and these two sites may or may not be allosterically linked. In another model, OlyA contains a single binding site for a preexisting complex of SM and cholesterol in membranes. We used two approaches to distinguish between these models. In one approach, we used a competition assay to test whether pre-incubation with SM alone, cholesterol alone, or mixtures of the two lipids would prevent the binding of OlyA to red blood cells (RBCs), whose membranes contain high concentrations of SM and cholesterol (de Gier and Van Deenen, 1961de Gier J. Van Deenen L. Some lipid characteristics of red cell membranes of various animal species.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 49: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). While OlyA binding does not disrupt RBC membranes, membrane-bound OlyA can recruit a cofactor, pleurotolysin B (PlyB), to form a transmembrane pore and cause hemolysis (Figures S1B and S1C). Using PlyB-mediated hemolysis as a readout for OlyA binding, we observed that pre-incubation with either SM or cholesterol did not block OlyA binding to RBCs (Figure 1C). In contrast, pre-incubation with a 1:1 mixture of SM and cholesterol resulted in a complete block of OlyA binding to RBCs (Figure 1C). Sequential pre-incubation, first with SM and then with cholesterol, or vice versa, did not block OlyA binding. A different result was obtained with cholesterol-binding and pore-forming full-length ALO (ALOFL), hemolysis by which was inhibited by pre-incubation with any of the conditions that included cholesterol irrespective of the order of addition (Figure 1C). In a second approach, we tested the effect of immobilization of membrane lipids on OlyA binding. If OlyA was sequentially binding SM and cholesterol at two distinct binding sites or was inducing SM/cholesterol complex formation, one might expect that restricting lipid motion would disrupt the membrane binding of OlyA. We generated a fluorescently labeled version of OlyA (designated as fOlyA; Figure S1D, lanes 1 and 2) and also prepared supported lipid bilayers on glass surfaces. The lipid molecules in both SM and SM/sterol bilayers were fluid, as judged by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements (Figure 1D). Recovery was slower in sterol-containing bilayers compared to bilayers without sterols. Fixation with osmium tetroxide completely blocked the fluidity of all bilayers (Figure 1D), a result consistent with previous studies (Jost et al., 1973Jost P. Brooks U.J. Griffith O.H. Fluidity of phospholipid bilayers and membranes after exposure to osmium tetroxide and gluteraldehyde.J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We then measured fOlyA binding and found that fOlyA only bound to supported bilayers containing both SM and cholesterol and that this binding was unaffected by osmium tetroxide fixation (Figure 1E). While not conclusive, both of the above experiments favor a model where OlyA contains a single binding site for a pre-formed SM/cholesterol complex in membranes. To further define this complex, we measured the cholesterol-concentration dependence for OlyA binding. Binding of OlyA increased in a sigmoidal fashion as cholesterol content of liposomes increased up to 60 mole% (Figure 1F), which is close to the solubility limit of cholesterol in bilayers containing choline-phospholipids (Huang et al., 1999Huang J. Buboltz J.T. Feigenson G.W. Maximum solubility of cholesterol in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1417: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). No binding was observed when cholesterol was absent or replaced with epicholesterol. To investigate higher cholesterol concentrations, we deposited ethanolic mixtures of SM and cholesterol as lipid films on nitrocellulose membranes. This approach allowed us to assay the entire range of SM/cholesterol ratios, and we found that OlyA binding showed a sharp maximum at 65 mole% cholesterol (Figure 1G). To gain further insight into OlyA’s interaction with SM and cholesterol, we performed structural analysis. A modified version of the OlyA construct used for the above biochemical studies, designated as OlyA(WT) (Figure S2A), was purified (Figures S2B and S2C) and crystallized in the absence or presence of saturating amounts of an equimolar mixture of SM and cholesterol. Crystals obtained from both conditions were used to determine the structure of OlyA(WT) at resolutions of 1.15 Å (no ligand, Figure S2D) and 1.33 Å (with ligand, Figure 2A) (Table 1). Both OlyA(WT) structures showed a β sandwich fold, similar to that observed for a related toxin, pleurotolysin A (Lukoyanova et al., 2015Lukoyanova N. Kondos S.C. Farabella I. Law R.H. Reboul C.F. Caradoc-Davies T.T. Spicer B.A. Kleifeld O. Traore D.A. Ekkel S.M. et al.Conformational changes during pore formation by the perforin-related protein pleurotolysin.PLoS Biol. 2015; 13: e1002049Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The β sandwich is comprised of nine β sheets and one short α helix that are connected by four flexible loops on the COOH-terminal end and three flexible loops on the NH2-terminal end. Crystals obtained with lipid ligands contained additional electron density in a shallow channel bounded by the sidechains of W28 and K99, residues that lie on two separate loops on the NH2-terminal end (Figures 2A and 2B). This density was strong enough to be modeled in only one of the four monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Part of the SM ceramide base (Figure 2C, red) was tentatively assigned to this observed density, and a possible orientation of the rest of SM is shown for reference (Figure 2A). No other parts of SM, cholesterol, or crystallization buffer components could adequately account for the observed density. This assignment of a portion of SM is still not definitive as the elongated electron density could be another hydrophobic molecule that co-purified with OlyA(WT). Even with these caveats, it is noteworthy that the only clear bound density may correspond to the ceramide portion of SM, which is the main structural difference between SM and PC (Figure S1A), lipids for which OlyA(WT) shows all-or-none specificity.Figure 2Structural Analysis of SM Binding by Wild-type OlyAShow full caption(A) Overall structure of OlyA (teal) bound to a portion of SM (yellow sticks, see C).

(E) Binding properties of OlyA mutants. Indicated His6-tagged mutant versions of OlyA were overexpressed and purified, and their lipid specificities were measured using liposome dot blot assays. The mean value (n = 3) for binding of OlyA(WT) to 1:1 SM:cholesterol liposomes was set to 1. All other mean binding values (n = 3) were normalized relative to this set point and converted to a green-to-red color scale. Standard errors for all measurements were less than 10%. Chol., cholesterol; Epi., epicholesterol; N, NH2 terminus; C, COOH terminus. Data for the outermost shell are given in parentheses. To test the relevance of this structural model, we generated mutant versions of OlyA(WT) where all residues within 5 Å of the putative ligand density (13 in total) were individually mutated to alanines (Figure 2D). Dot blot assays for protein-lipid binding (Figures S2E and S2F) showed that replacement of D93, S94, T100, G70, T71, or T72 with alanines retained specific binding of OlyA to liposomes containing SM and cholesterol, while replacement of Q5, W6, W28, P95, or W96 with alanines completely abolished binding of OlyA (Figure 2E). Mutation of K99 to alanine partially reduced OlyA binding, while mutation to oppositely charged glutamate completely abolished binding. We also tested these OlyA mutants for their ability to lyse RBCs in a PlyB-dependent manner (Figures S1B and S1C) and found that mutations that disrupted OlyA binding to membranes in the dot blot assay also disrupted their PlyB-mediated hemolytic capacity, whereas mutations that did not disrupt OlyA binding to membranes did not affect hemolysis (Figure S3). It is worth emphasizing that OlyA binding is abolished by mutation of either W28 or K99, residues that form the boundaries of the shallow channel housing the putative SM density (Figure 2B). Unexpectedly, mutation of E69 to alanine eliminated the cholesterol specificity of OlyA(WT). This mutant protein, designated as OlyA(E69A), bound to liposomes containing SM whether or not they also contained cholesterol or epicholesterol (Figure 2E). The specifi"

The addition of mealworm powder (MP) did not negatively affect the technological features of either doughs or breads. All the tested doughs showed the same leavening ability, whereas breads containing 5% MP showed the highest specific volume and the lowest firmness. An enrichment in protein content was observed in experimental breads where the highest values for this parameter were recorded in breads containing 10% MP. Breads fortified with 10% MP also exhibited a significant increase in the content of free amino acids, and especially in the following essential amino acids: tyrosine, methionine, isoleucine, and leucine. By contrast, no differences in nutritional quality of lipids were seen between fortified and control breads. Results of sensory analyses revealed that protein fortification of bread with MP significantly affected bread texture and overall liking, as well as crust colour, depending on the substitution level. Overall, proof of concept was provided for the inclusion of MP into bread doughs started with different leavening agents (sourdough and/or baker’s yeast), at 5 or 10% substitution level of soft wheat flour. Based on the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale, the proposed bread making technology can be situated at level 4 (validation in laboratory environment), thus suggesting that the production of breads with MP might easily be scaled up at industrial level. However, potential spoilage and safety issues that need to be further considered were highlighted."

This neuro-immune mechanism of selective NK cell-mediated degeneration of damaged but intact sensory axons complements Wallerian degeneration and suggests the therapeutic potential of modulating NK cell function to resolve painful neuropathy through the clearance of partially damaged nerves. Injury to a peripheral nerve results in the destruction of severed axons distal to the injury site via Wallerian degeneration (Conforti et al., 2014Conforti L. Gilley J. Coleman M.P. Wallerian degeneration: An emerging axon death pathway linking injury and disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 15: 394-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) thereby facilitating subsequent debris removal by immune cells (Dekkers et al., 2013Dekkers M.P. Nikoletopoulou V. Barde Y.A. Cell biology in neuroscience: Death of developing neurons: New insights and implications for connectivity.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 203: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, a genetic program of axonal outgrowth is then initiated to allow the re-innervation of targets by healthy nerves (Chandran et al., 2016Chandran V. Coppola G. Nawabi H. Omura T. Versano R. Huebner E.A. Zhang A. Costigan M. Yekkirala A. Barrett L. et al.A systems-level analysis of the peripheral nerve intrinsic axonal growth program.Neuron. 2016; 89: 956-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), which is in turn supported by the permissive environment created by infiltrating immune cells (Gaudet et al., 2011Gaudet A.D. Popovich P.G. Ramer M.S. Wallerian degeneration: Gaining perspective on inflammatory events after peripheral nerve injury.J. Neuroinflammation. 2011; 8: 110Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). While this adaptive response to axonal injury facilitates the phagocytosis of debris and ultimately regeneration of axons, it also contributes to the maladaptive symptom of neuropathic pain (Costigan et al., 2009Costigan M. Scholz J. Woolf C.J. Neuropathic pain: A maladaptive response of the nervous system to damage.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). As a consequence, neuro-immune signaling mechanisms of hypersensitivity following injury to the adult peripheral nervous system (PNS) are the subject of intense research (Chavan et al., 2017Chavan S.S. Pavlov V.A. Tracey K.J. Mechanisms and therapeutic relevance of neuro-immune communication.Immunity. 2017; 46: 927-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Axon degeneration is generally regarded as neuron autonomous; however, discrepancies in the timing of axon degeneration after injury (Neukomm and Freeman, 2014Neukomm L.J. Freeman M.R. Diverse cellular and molecular modes of axon degeneration.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 515-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and recent evidence pointing to the role of as-yet-unknown extrinsic factors in axon fragmentation (Gamage et al., 2017Gamage K.K. Cheng I. Park R.E. Karim M.S. Edamura K. Hughes C. Spano A.J. Erisir A. Deppmann C.D. Death Receptor 6 Promotes Wallerian Degeneration in Peripheral Axons.Curr. Biol. 2017; 27: 1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) open up the possibility of a role for immune cells with cytotoxic action in the degeneration process itself. Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) typically involved in the destruction of tumor or virus-infected target cells. NK cell activity is coordinated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory signals mediated via a distinct receptor repertoire (Vivier et al., 2011Vivier E. Raulet D.H. Moretta A. Caligiuri M.A. Zitvogel L. Lanier L.L. Yokoyama W.M. Ugolini S. Innate or adaptive immunity? The example of natural killer cells.Science. 2011; 331: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). One of the best-characterized activating receptors is NK group 2D (NKG2D), which is expressed on NK cells and some T cells. Endogenous ligands for NKG2D are normally absent from most tissues but are expressed in disease states such as tumorigenesis and infection (Raulet et al., 2013Raulet D.H. Gasser S. Gowen B.G. Deng W. Jung H. Regulation of ligands for the NKG2D activating receptor.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31: 413-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). NK cells are found among the immune cells that infiltrate the damaged nerve following injury in adult animals (Cui et al., 2000Cui J.G. Holmin S. Mathiesen T. Meyerson B.A. Linderoth B. Possible role of inflammatory mediators in tactile hypersensitivity in rat models of mononeuropathy.Pain. 2000; 88: 239-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and the presence of intra-neural NK cells correlates with disease severity in a form of peripheral neuropathy (Lackowski et al., 1998Lackowski D. Koberda J.L. DeLoughery T.G. So Y. Natural killer cell leukemia as a cause of peripheral neuropathy and meningitis: Case report.Neurology. 1998; 51: 640-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NK cells have previously been shown to be involved in guanethidine toxicity to sympathetic neurons (Hickey et al., 1992Hickey W.F. Ueno K. Hiserodt J.C. Schmidt R.E. Exogenously-induced, natural killer cell-mediated neuronal killing: A novel pathogenetic mechanism.J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, adult murine NK cells are directly cytotoxic to immature embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vitro (Backström et al., 2000Backström E. Chambers B.J. Kristensson K. Ljunggren H.G. Direct NK cell-mediated lysis of syngenic dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, NK cells at this stage of primary sensory neuron development appear to be immature (Tang et al., 2012Tang Y. Peitzsch C. Charoudeh H.N. Cheng M. Chaves P. Jacobsen S.E. Sitnicka E. Emergence of NK-cell progenitors and functionally competent NK-cell lineage subsets in the early mouse embryo.Blood. 2012; 120: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and thus the consequences of this NK cell interaction for the adult are unclear. We investigated the response and functional consequences of NK cell interactions in the context of peripheral nerve injury in the adult mouse. Our results identify cytotoxic NK cells as a novel cellular trigger for the specific degeneration of damaged primary afferent axons that are still connected to their cell bodies in the injured PNS. Enhancing this NK cell-dependent degeneration mechanism increased clearance of damaged axons resulting in lower levels of mechanical hypersensitivity post-injury. This discovery provides new insight into immune mechanisms of damaged axon clearance and suggests the therapeutic potential of interventions that modulate NK cell function. NK cells are classically activated by the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2, which primes them for cytotoxic attack by increasing intracellular content of granzyme B (Figure S1A). We examined the effects of IL-2-stimulated NK cells on DRG neurons acutely isolated from embryonic (E15) and adult mice (cultured less than 24 h in vitro), using freshly isolated, unstimulated splenic NK cells as a control (Figure S1B). Confirming original reports (Backström et al., 2000Backström E. Chambers B.J. Kristensson K. Ljunggren H.G. Direct NK cell-mediated lysis of syngenic dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro.J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), embryonic DRG neurons were highly susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Figures 1A and 1B ). Separating NK cells and embryonic DRG with a transwell membrane prevented neurite fragmentation (Figure S1C) despite the presence of nanogram amounts of granzyme B in the culture media (Figure S1D). In contrast, we found no evidence of cell lysis of acutely isolated adult DRG neurons by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-release cytotoxicity assay, even at much higher effector-to-target (E:T) ratios (Figure 1B), although some neurites appeared truncated (Figure 1A).Figure 1Acutely Cultured Embryonic but Not Adult DRG Neurons Reveal Susceptibility to NK-Mediated Cytotoxicity by RAE1Show full caption(A) Immunolabeling of co-culture (4 h) between embryonic (top) or adult (bottom) DRG neurons (β-tubulin, magenta) and either freshly isolated (control) or IL-2-stimulated natural killer (NK) cells (NKp46, green).

Time-lapse confocal imaging of DiI-labeled DRG neurons co-cultured with IL-2-stimulated NK cells expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) revealed that stimulated NK cells were highly motile, enabling multiple direct cell-cell contacts between NK cells and sensory neurons. In embryonic DRG, this led to neurite destruction and cell death (Video S1); however, acutely cultured adult DRG neurite membranes remained largely intact (Video S2). NK cell contacts were often synchronous with intracellular Ca2+ events in embryonic DRG neurites (Figures 1C and 1D; Video S3), leading to neurite fragmentation. While Ca2+ events were also observed in adult DRG after NK cell contact (Figures 1C and 1D) and occasionally led to neurite fragmentation (Video S4), they occurred at a much lower frequency than in embryonic neurons (Figure 1D). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJlNjBjODBhZDY3MGU5YTliNmU4ZDZhNmU0YjQ5ZTEyMiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MTg1NzY3fQ.qXxGYnB3Z2x0tttubRSnRcJ6NOjJniMZoa9khGLAU2D8IELZxIDyD1q4JNSX24EETal1-p9UZKfNFOI5MyxIkBw4-M3_sfrPw2SzC7So-Y02X8Fdrdd_yJGjopz2vYG_hSfk7cxVSF1PM99fdEIkSK-p1UrvPC7ZOMrtNoWmxF8SQ0xCMe_dv4UFQdYPlB_rY3HxjMxvOutPeE6ec5zeOAoZQfZyq-McWCMEzUUaQwLZjXLnS6ZlRWixRvbUTHXsu1xdrySBsPgjho4RYqRBw9EWVdprOFm-1PtpFyY5_sZIxzV8pQdxfyCGOYG-CvtJtR70lx1CyZYIujMonbSz1w Download .mp4 (1.36 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1.

Live Confocal Ca2+ Imaging of Adult DRG Neuron Undergoing Local Axon Degeneration by IL-2-Stimulated NK Cells In Vitro, Related to Figure 1 Retinoic Acid Early inducible protein 1 (RAE1), encoded by the Raet1 gene family (α,β,γ,δ,ε), acts as a membrane-bound ligand for the activating receptor NKG2D (Cerwenka et al., 2000Cerwenka A. Bakker A.B. McClanahan T. Wagner J. Wu J. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Retinoic acid early inducible genes define a ligand family for the activating NKG2D receptor in mice.Immunity. 2000; 12: 721-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), which has previously been implicated in NK cell-mediated lysis of embryonic DRG (Backström et al., 2003Backström E. Chambers B.J. Ho E.L. Naidenko O.V. Mariotti R. Fremont D.H. Yokoyama W.M. Kristensson K. Ljunggren H.G. Natural killer cell-mediated lysis of dorsal root ganglia neurons via RAE1/NKG2D interactions.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed that NK cytotoxicity against embryonic DRG could be attenuated by an NKG2D receptor blocking antibody (Figure S1E). Using universal primers, we observed Raet1 transcripts in acutely dissociated embryonic and adult DRG neurons (Figure 1E), but they were 17 times more abundant in embryonic DRG relative to adult DRG when assayed by qPCR (Figure 1F). Western blot using a pan-RAE1 antibody revealed a band at approximately 40–50 kDa in embryonic but not adult DRG tissue (Figure 1G). To assess the functional contribution of Raet1 in embryonic DRG neurons, we selectively knocked down all Raet1 isoforms using small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Figure 1H), which, compared to negative control, led to a 20% reduction in NK-mediated lysis (Figure 1I). Adult mouse DRG neurons were cultured in a microfluidic chamber for 5 days in vitro. Following exposure to stimulated NK cells, we saw a 25% loss of neurite coverage relative to freshly isolated control NK cells (Figures 2A and 2B ). Raet1 mRNA was time-dependently upregulated in adult DRG cultures (Figure 2C), with corresponding de novo expression of RAE1 protein after 2 days in vitro (Figure 2D). Subsequently, adult DRG neurons cultured for 2 days displayed over a 10-fold increase in neurite fragmentation relative to controls in the presence of stimulated NK cells (Figures 2E and 2F). Transfection of dissociated adult DRG neurons with Raet1 siRNA prior to culture delayed Raet1 upregulation (Figure 2G) and reduced the ability of stimulated NK cells to fragment DRG neurites relative to negative control siRNA (Figures 2H and 2I). We also confirmed that fragmentation of adult DRG neurites (2 days in vitro) can be reduced by blocking the NKG2D receptor on NK cells prior to co-culture (Figures S2A and S2B).Figure S2Antibody Blockade of NKG2D Receptor on NK Cells Attenuates Neurite Degeneration of Adult DRG Neurons In Vitro, Related to Figures 2 and 3Show full caption(A) Immunolabeling (β-tubulin III) of cultured adult DRG (103 cells per coverslip) (2 days in vitro) co-cultured (4 h) with IL-2 stimulated NK cells (2.5x105 cells per coverslip) pre-treated with either anti-NKG2D or IgG isotype control antibody.(B) Quantification of DRG neurite fragmentation after NKG2D receptor blockade.

We next asked whether Raet1 upregulation in dissociated DRG in vitro occurs in injured cells in vivo by cutting the spinal nerve of the fifth lumbar DRG (L5x) in adult mice (Figure 3A). An injury-dependent upregulation of Raet1 was revealed by qPCR using RNA isolated from L5 DRG at 4 and 7 days after L5x injury (Figure 3B). The difference in Raet1 transcript levels between ipsilateral and contralateral L5 DRG 7 days after L5x injury was maintained over the first 24 h in culture (Figure 3C). Injured (L5x) DRG exhibited 3.5-fold more fragmentation of neurites when exposed to IL-2-stimulated NK cells (Figures 3F and 3G) than DRG from uninjured (sham) animals (Figures 3D and 3E), an effect that was attenuated by prior blocking of NKG2D receptors on NK cells (Figures S2C and S2D). No difference was seen in the total DRG cell body area between different groups (Figure S2E) suggesting that the fragmentation was neurite specific. To characterize the response and function of NK cells in vivo, we crossed Ncr1icre mice (Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2011Narni-Mancinelli E. Chaix J. Fenis A. Kerdiles Y.M. Yessaad N. Reynders A. Gregoire C. Luche H. Ugolini S. Tomasello E. et al.Fate mapping analysis of lymphoid cells expressing the NKp46 cell surface receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 18324-18329Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) with reporter mice that express either YFP (Rosa26eyfp) or the diphtheria toxin (DTx) receptor (Rosa26dtr; DTR) following Cre-mediated recombination. Ncr1 encodes the NKp46 receptor, which is expressed on all NK cells, as well as tissue-resident ILCs, including group 1 ILCs (ILC1s) and a subset of group 3 ILCs (NCR1+ ILC3s). This genetic approach allowed us to identify (Figures S3A and S3B) or systemically deplete NKp46+ cells in vivo (Figure S3C). We did not observe YFP-positive NK cells in sciatic nerve in naive mice (data not shown) or sham surgery mice (Figures 3H and 3I). In contrast, L5x injury led to the marked recruitment of YFP+ NK cells to the injured sciatic nerve (Figures 3H and 3I) and was paralleled by an increase in granzyme B content at 7 days post-injury (Figure 3J), which was significantly reduced by prior systemic depletion of NK cells (Figure 3K). L5x injury led to a reduction in the mechanical withdrawal threshold in the ipsilateral hind paw of NKp46-DTR mice treated with PBS (Figure S3D) that was not affected by prior depletion of NK cells using DTx (Figure S3D). The sensitivity of the uninjured contralateral paw remained unaffected by either treatment (Figure S3E). Consistent with the effect of nerve transection, crush injury (Figure 4A) also drove Raet1 expression in ipsilateral DRG as observed by qPCR (Figure 4B). In situ hybridization revealed Raet1 transcripts within individual DRG neurons (Figures 4C and 4D) and across a broad range of cell sizes (Figures S4A and S4B). RAE1 is known to be controlled by post-transcriptional modification (Raulet et al., 2013Raulet D.H. Gasser S. Gowen B.G. Deng W. Jung H. Regulation of ligands for the NKG2D activating receptor.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31: 413-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar); therefore, we performed western blot on lysates of sciatic nerve and DRG tissues. Crush injury induced a 45-kDa band in ipsilateral injured sciatic nerve (Figure 4E), indicating an increase in the glycosylated mature form of RAE1 (Arapovic et al., 2009Arapovic J. Lenac T. Antulov R. Polic B. Ruzsics Z. Carayannopoulos L.N. Koszinowski U.H. Krmpotic A. Jonjic S. Differential susceptibility of RAE-1 isoforms to mouse cytomegalovirus.J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8198-8207Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the nerve, but not in the DRG (Figure 4F). Chronic tight ligation of the sciatic nerve, to block axonal transport, revealed RAE1 immunolabeling within crushed axons proximal to the ligation site (Figures 4G, 4H, and S4B) and greater amounts of RAE1 protein at the ligation site relative to within the axons proximal to the ligation (Figure S4C).Figure S4Injury-Dependent Regulation of Raet1 mRNA and RAE1 Protein Expression in Sensory Neurons In Vivo, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) The size of all NeuN+ neuronal profiles in each DRG are shown as a histograms in blue (50 μm2 bins).

The majority of de novo Raet1-expressing NeuN+ profiles in ipsilateral DRG appear to be in the small-medium size range (200-500 μm2). A large number of Raet1 in situ spots are also seen NeuN+ profiles of 500 μm2 and greater in ipsilateral DRG.

However, central neural pathways in naive mammals that recognize sex of other individuals remain poorly characterized. We examined the role of the principal component of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNSTpr), a limbic center, in social interactions in mice. We find that activity of aromatase-expressing BNSTpr (AB) neurons appears to encode sex of other animals and subsequent displays of mating in sexually naive males. Silencing these neurons in males eliminates preference for female pheromones and abrogates mating success, whereas activating them even transiently promotes male-male mating. Surprisingly, female AB neurons do not appear to control sex recognition, mating, or maternal aggression. In summary, AB neurons represent sex of other animals and govern ensuing social behaviors in sexually naive males.

In summary, AB neurons represent sex of other animals and govern ensuing social behaviors in sexually naive males. Sexually reproducing animals display sex differences in social behaviors that enhance reproductive success. Many sexually dimorphic behaviors are acquired traits, but others, such as mating or aggression, are innate in that they can be displayed without prior experience. Such primal interactions are guided by the sex of interacting individuals, indicating that naive animals recognize the sex of their conspecifics. Indeed, naive male mice mate with females but attack males. Neurons in the medial amygdala (MeA) and ventrolateral part of ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) govern these behaviors in male mice (Hong et al., 2014Hong W. Kim D.-W. Anderson D.J.

In mice and other animals, BNSTpr neurons are innervated by accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) neurons and are therefore one synapse away from neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO) (Broadwell, 1975Broadwell R.D.

Despite these advances, the specific functions of BNSTpr neurons in social behaviors remain unclear because of a lack of markers that enable targeted studies of these cells. Aromatase, which converts androgens to estrogens, is restricted to a subset of BNSTpr neurons in the mouse BNST (Fisher et al., 1998Fisher C.R. Graves K.H. Parlow A.F. Simpson E.R.

We used genetically engineered mice to test the role of AB neurons in sexually dimorphic social behaviors. Calcium imaging of AB neurons in sexually naive males revealed that these cells are differentially activated by males and females. Functional manipulations reveal that these neurons are necessary to distinguish the sexes and for ensuing social interactions, and that their activation elicits male-male mating. By contrast, female AB neurons appear not to participate in sex recognition or social interactions. Together, AB neurons represent a central neural locus for sex recognition in sexually naive males to direct innate sex specific social behaviors. To image activity of AB neurons, we expressed a virally encoded Cre-dependent calcium sensor GCaMP6s in AB neurons in AroCre/IPIN mice to perform fiber photometry (Chen et al., 2015Chen Y. Lin Y.-C.

AroCre/IPIN mice harbor Cre and nuclear LacZ in the 3′UTR of aromatase and enable manipulation of aromatase+ cells in behaviorally and physiologically wild-type (WT) mice (Unger et al., 2015Unger E.K. Burke Jr., K.J. Yang C.F. Bender K.J. Fuller P.M. Shah N.M.

We confirmed functional expression of GCaMP6s in AB neurons in slices (Figures S1A–S1E). Next, we singly housed sexually naive AroCre/IPIN males and imaged GCaMP6s fluorescence after inserting a WT male intruder. GCaMP6s signal increased with intruder entry and subsided after initial exploration of the intruder (69.1 ± 11.7 s to return to baseline, mean ± SEM, n = 7) (Figures 1C, 1D, and 1F; Video S1). Following early exploration, resident males sniff (anogenital chemoinvestigation), tail rattle, or attack the intruder (Scott, 1966Scott J.P. Agonistic behavior of mice and rats: a review.Am. Zool. 1966; 6: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, Unger et al., 2015Unger E.K. Burke Jr., K.J. Yang C.F. Bender K.J. Fuller P.M. Shah N.M. Medial amygdalar aromatase neurons regulate aggression in both sexes.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We did not detect changes in GCaMP6s signal during these behaviors (Figures 1E–1G and S1F–S1H; Video S1) (peak Fn during tail rattles: 1.01 ± 0.002, p = 0.34, n = 7). GCaMP6s lacks high temporal resolution, and it is possible that baseline firing of AB neurons is higher during an encounter with an intruder than single housing. Nevertheless, baseline fluorescence (p = 0.41, n = 7) was comparable between these two settings. A recent study reported that sexually naive resident males do not attack intruder males (Remedios et al., 2017Remedios R. Kennedy A. Zelikowsky M. Grewe B.F. Schnitzer M.J. Anderson D.J. Social behaviour shapes hypothalamic neural ensemble representations of conspecific sex.Nature. 2017; 550: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). By contrast, sexually naive AroCre/IPIN resident males clearly attack intruder males, consistent with prior work and our tests with WT males (Figures 1G and S1I–S1N) (Connor, 1972Connor J.

Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized serine/threonine kinase STK19 as a novel NRAS activator. STK19 phosphorylates NRAS to enhance its binding to its downstream effectors and promotes oncogenic NRAS-mediated melanocyte malignant transformation. A recurrent D89N substitution in STK19 whose alterations were identified in 25% of human melanomas represents a gain-of-function mutation that interacts better with NRAS to enhance melanocyte transformation. STK19D89N knockin leads to skin hyperpigmentation and promotes NRASQ61R-driven melanomagenesis in vivo. Finally, we developed ZT-12-037-01 (1a) as a specific STK19-targeted inhibitor and showed that it effectively blocks oncogenic NRAS-driven melanocyte malignant transformation and melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo.

This mutation impairs the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity and traps NRAS in a constitutive GTP-bound active conformation, which recruits RAF to the inner membrane for dimerization and activation (Marais et al., 1995Marais R.

Oncogenic activation of NRAS leads to growth factor-independent proliferation of melanocytes and ultimately transformation to melanoma (Ji et al., 2012Ji Z. Flaherty K.T. Tsao H. Targeting the RAS pathway in melanoma.Trends Mol. Med. 2012; 18: 27-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, NRAS Q61 mutations are critical drivers of melanomagenesis and important therapeutic targets. However, unlike the well-defined inhibitors targeting the oncogenic BRAFV600E mutation (Lavoie and Therrien, 2015Lavoie H. Therrien M. Regulation of RAF protein kinases in ERK signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the development of NRAS-selective inhibitors has been unsuccessful in the past decades (Cox et al., 2014Cox A.D.

The serine/threonine-protein kinase 19 (STK19) was originally reported to phosphorylate α-casein at serine/threonine residues and histones at serine residues (Gomez-Escobar et al., 1998Gomez-Escobar N. Chou C.F. Lin W.W. Hsieh S.L. Campbell R.D. The G11 gene located in the major histocompatibility complex encodes a novel nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase.J. Biol.

However, the role of STK19 in cancer initiation and development is poorly appreciated. Importantly, STK19 harbors significant somatic hotspot mutations in 5% of melanoma (Hodis et al., 2012Hodis E. Watson I.R. Kryukov G.V. Arold S.T. Imielinski M. Theurillat J.P. Nickerson E. Auclair D. Li L. Place C. et al.A landscape of driver mutations in melanoma.Cell. 2012; 150: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) and 10% of skin basal cell carcinoma (Bonilla et al., 2016Bonilla X. Parmentier L. King B. Bezrukov F. Kaya G. Zoete V. Seplyarskiy V.B. Sharpe H.J. McKee T. Letourneau A. et al.Genomic analysis identifies new drivers and progression pathways in skin basal cell carcinoma.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) respectively, and is listed among the top melanoma driver genes (Lawrence et al., 2014Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H. Robinson J.T. Garraway L.A. Golub T.R. Meyerson M. Gabriel S.B. Lander E.S. Getz G. Discovery and saturation analysis of cancer genes across 21 tumour types.Nature. 2014; 505: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). This strong genetic evidence implies an important, but uncharacterized role of STK19 in melanocyte malignant transformation and melanoma progression. In this study, we set out to use melanoma as a model to identify novel strategies for targeting oncogenic RAS signaling by identifying kinases that regulate NRAS activity. We discovered STK19 as an NRAS-activating kinase with frequent gain-of-function mutations and provide evidence that blockade of STK19 represents an effective therapeutic strategy for NRAS mutant melanomas. Activation of NRAS signaling depends on its association with effector proteins, such as RAF and PI3K, that contain a common RAS-binding domain (RBD) (Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011Pylayeva-Gupta Y. Grabocka E. Bar-Sagi D. RAS oncogenes: weaving a tumorigenic web.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 761-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Disrupting the NRAS-RBD protein interaction would represent an effective therapy in NRAS mutant melanoma. To achieve this objective, we screened for kinases that could regulate the activity of NRASQ61R, the most prevalent NRAS mutation found in melanoma (Jakob et al., 2012Jakob J.A. Bassett Jr., R.L. Ng C.S. Curry J.L. Joseph R.W. Alvarado G.C. Rohlfs M.L. Richard J. Gershenwald J.E. Kim K.B. et al.NRAS mutation status is an independent prognostic factor in metastatic melanoma.Cancer. 2012; 118: 4014-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We therefore established HEK293FT cells expressing HA-tagged NRASQ61R and screened a primary human kinome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library using a modified active NRAS chemiluminescence assay as a readout. Specifically, HA-NRASQ61R from siRNA-transfected cells was captured using a GST-CRAF-RBD fusion protein on glutathione-coated plates and detected with an anti-HA tag antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for luminescence quantification (Figure 1A). We initially identified 12 kinases whose knockdown led to more than 50% inhibition of NRASQ61R activity and six kinases whose knockdown led to at least 2-fold upregulation of NRASQ61R activity (Figure 1B). Among these genes, STK19 was one of the candidates whose knockdown caused the highest inhibition on NRAS activity (35.1% of control group) (Figure 1B). To identify the status of STK19 in human melanomas, we investigated STK19 alteration in the TCGA melanoma cohort (PanCancer Atlas) and found STK19 to be altered in 91 of 363 (25.07%) sequenced skin cutaneous melanoma cases (Figure 1C). This is consistent with the analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data that discovered STK19 as one of six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2) with a statistically significant functional mutation burden (Hodis et al., 2012Hodis E. Watson I.R. Kryukov G.V. Arold S.T. Imielinski M. Theurillat J.P. Nickerson E. Auclair D. Li L. Place C. et al.A landscape of driver mutations in melanoma.Cell. 2012; 150: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). As such, STK19 has been listed as an oncogenic candidate among the Broad Institute melanoma driver genes (Lawrence et al., 2014Lawrence M.S. Stojanov P. Mermel C.H. Robinson J.T. Garraway L.A. Golub T.R. Meyerson M. Gabriel S.B. Lander E.S. Getz G.

Analysis of STK19 alteration in melanomas collected in different cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics databases further confirmed this discovery (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J. Caponigro G. Stransky N.

However, the function of STK19 is largely uncharacterized, particularly in melanoma initiation and progression. We found that STK19 alteration was significantly mutually exclusive with BRAF in human melanomas (p = 0.002) (Figure S1A), consistent with BRAF lying downstream of NRAS activation (Lavoie and Therrien, 2015Lavoie H. Therrien M. Regulation of RAF protein kinases in ERK signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Given these observations, we further investigated the potential role of STK19 in regulating NRAS functions in melanomas.Figure S1STK19 Is a Critical Regulator of NRAS Function, Related to Figure 1Show full captionA.

Data are means ± SD relative to control group (n = 6). ∗∗∗p < 0.001, Student’s t test. To confirm whether STK19 knockdown inhibits NRAS activity, we investigated whether the downstream signaling of NRAS was inhibited after STK19 silencing. Retroviruses encoding empty HA, HA-tagged wild-type NRAS, or NRASQ61R were introduced into human primary melanocytes (HPMs) depleted of STK19. The active-RAS pull-down assay indicated that depletion of STK19 markedly decreased the active fraction of both wild-type and oncogenic NRAS, and consequently, signaling downstream of NRAS via the RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways was diminished (Figure 1D). We also used melanoma cells with different NRAS mutation status to identify the role of STK19 in regulating endogenous NRAS. To this end, STK19 was silenced in A375 and UACC62 cells, both with BRAFV600E and wild-type NRAS, or SK-MEL-2 and WM2032 cells that both express NRASQ61R and wild-type BRAF (Barretina et al., 2012Barretina J.

Clark W.H. et al.Characteristics of cultured human melanocytes isolated from different stages of tumor progression.Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 5670-5676PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of active NRAS and its downstream effectors (p-MEK, p-ERK1/2, p-AKT) was highly efficient in SK-MEL-2 and WM2032 (NRASQ61R, BRAFWT) cells, but the inhibition was much weaker in A375 and UACC62 (BRAFV600E, NRASWT) cells (Figure S1B). Consistently, depletion of STK19 significantly decreased the growth rate of SK-MEL-2 and WM2032 (NRASQ61R, BRAFWT) cells, but had a much smaller effect on the BRAFV600E, NRASWT cells, or primary melanocytes (Figure S1C). To confirm that inhibition of NRAS signaling was mediated by STK19 knockdown, two new sets of STK19-targeted small hairpin RNA (shRNA) were exploited and the resulting depletion of STK19 notably inhibited NRAS activity and its downstream signaling in SK-MEL-2 and WM2032 cells (Figures S1D and S1E). Furthermore, we performed rescue experiments and infected the STK19-depleted melanoma cells with retroviruses encoding empty Flag or Flag-tagged STK19. The ectopic expression of STK19-Flag restored the activation of NRAS signaling (Figure S1F), confirming that the inhibition of NRAS signaling using STK19-specific shRNAs was mediated by knockdown of STK19 rather than the off-target effects. Collectively, these results suggest that STK19 has a crucial role in activating oncogenic NRASQ61R -driven signaling. To explore the potential role of STK19 in NRASQ61R-driven tumorigenesis, the role of STK19 in melanocyte proliferation and malignant transformation was evaluated using genetically engineered human immortalized melanocytes (hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C)) (Lissanu Deribe et al., 2016Lissanu Deribe Y. Shi Y. Rai K. Nezi L. Amin S.B. Wu C.C. Akdemir K.C. Mahdavi M. Peng Q. Chang Q.E. et al.Truncating PREX2 mutations activate its GEF activity and alter gene expression regulation in NRAS-mutant melanoma.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E1296-E1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) expressing NRASQ61R together with STK19 silencing. The results indicated that silencing STK19 (Figure S1G) substantially inhibited the colony formation capacity of NRASQ61R-transformed melanocytes (Figure 1E), as well as their proliferation (Figure S1H) and tumor-forming ability in xenografts (Figures 1F–1H). These results suggest that STK19 is critical for NRASQ61R-driven melanomagenesis. To identify the direct substrates of STK19, cell lysates collected from SK-MEL-2 cells expressing human recombinant Flag-tagged STK19 protein were purified using anti-Flag beads and associated factors analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify STK19-interacting proteins (Figure S2A). NRAS was identified as one of the most abundant STK19-interacting proteins on the basis of total number of unique peptides (13) (Figure 2A). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that endogenous STK19 strongly interacted with NRAS in SK-MEL-2 and WM2032 cells (NRASQ61R), but bound less well in A375 and UACC62 cells (expressing wild-type NRAS) (Figures S2B and S2C). The NRASQ61R-STK19 interaction was confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation from HPMs exogenously expressing STK19-Flag and HA-NRAS wild-type (WT) or Q61R mutant (Figures 2B and 2C). These results indicate that STK19 directly interacts with NRAS, and especially with NRASQ61R.Figure 2STK19 Phosphorylates NRAS Protein at Serine 89Show full caption(A) Mass spectral peptide count of STK19-interacting proteins.(B and C) Exogenous interactions between HA-NRAS and STK19-Flag were detected by immunoprecipitation in HPMs.(D) HPMs were introduced with retroviruses encoding empty HA, HA-NRASWT or HA-NRASQ61R and/or STK19-Flag.

To address the significance of the STK19-NRASQ61R interaction, we asked whether NRAS was an STK19 substrate. Phosphorylated-serine, -threonine, and -tyrosine in NRAS were detected in cellular lysates collected from HPMs expressing ectopic STK19 and NRAS (WT or Q61R) after NRAS immunoprecipitation (Figure 2D). Strikingly, serine, but not threonine or tyrosine phosphorylation of NRASQ61R mutant, was substantially increased by STK19 expression, and only a marginal increase in phosphorylation of NRASWT was detected. We also observed robust endogenous NRAS phosphorylation in a panel of melanoma cells expressing NRASQ61R (Figure S2D) whereas phosphorylation of NRAS at serine residues was barely detectable in cells following STK19 silencing (Figures S2E and S2F). The upregulation of phosphorylated serine levels in NRAS was also diminished by overexpression of a kinase-dead STK19 K317P mutant (Gomez-Escobar et al., 1998Gomez-Escobar N. Chou C.F. Lin W.W. Hsieh S.L. Campbell R.D. The G11 gene located in the major histocompatibility complex encodes a novel nuclear serine/threonine protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30954-30960Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Figures S2G and S2H). These results suggest that STK19 phosphorylates NRAS at serine residues. The preferential phosphorylation of NRASQ61R compared to NRASWT was also observed using an in vitro kinase assay (Figure S2I), suggesting that STK19 has a stronger preference toward GTP-loaded active NRAS. To verify this, we further performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified NRAS recombinant protein preloaded with GDP, GTP, or GTPγS in the presence of recombinant STK19. We found a higher STK19-induced phosphorylation of the GTP- and GTPγS-loaded NRAS than GDP-loaded NRAS (Figure S2J). This was confirmed in experiments that showed STK19-induced phosphorylation of different NRAS mutant isoforms was more efficient than that of NRASWT (Figure S2K). To identify the specific NRAS serine residue(s) phosphorylated by STK19, we performed mass spectrometry after in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant NRASQ61R by purified recombinant STK19 protein. This approach identified phosphorylation of the evolutionarily conserved NRAS serine 89 (S89) (Figures 2E and 2F). In agreement with this observation, mutation of S89 to alanine (S89A) abolished phosphorylation of NRASWT and NRASQ61R (Figure 2G). To confirm that STK19 upregulates NRAS activity through phosphorylating NRAS protein at S89, HA-NRASWT, HA-NRASS89A, HA-NRASQ61R, or HA-NRASQ61R/S89A were expressed in HPMs expressing ectopic STK19-Flag. After immunoprecipitation of NRAS WT or mutants, immunoblots were performed to detect interactions between NRAS and its effectors, including BRAF, CRAF and PI3Kα. We found that STK19 overexpression dramatically enhanced the interaction between NRASQ61R and its effectors, and also stimulated signaling downstream of NRAS as detected by immunoblotting whole cell extracts (Figure 2H). No effects of STK19 were observed on a phosphorylation-defective form of NRAS (NRASS89A) or its signaling. By contrast, the introduction of phosphomimetic NRASQ61R/S89D enhanced NRAS interaction with its effectors and its"

LRRK2 regulates various intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways, including endolysosomal degradative events such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation. Recent studies have revealed that a subset of RAB proteins involved in secretory and endocytic recycling are LRRK2 kinase substrates in vivo. However, the effects of LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of these substrates on membrane trafficking remain unknown. Here, using an array of immunofluorescence and pulldown assays, we report that expression of active or phosphodeficient RAB8A variants rescues the G2019S LRRK2–mediated effects on endolysosomal membrane trafficking. Similarly, up-regulation of the RAB11–Rabin8–RAB8A cascade, which activates RAB8A, also reverted these trafficking deficits. Loss of RAB8A mimicked the effects of G2019S LRRK2 on endolysosomal trafficking and decreased RAB7A activity. Expression of pathogenic G2019S LRRK2 or loss of RAB8A interfered with EGFR degradation by causing its accumulation in a RAB4-positive endocytic compartment, which was accompanied by a deficit in EGFR recycling and was rescued upon expression of active RAB7A. Dominant-negative RAB7A expression resulted in similar deficits in EGF degradation, accumulation in a RAB4 compartment, and deficits in EGFR recycling, which were all rescued upon expression of active RAB8A. Taken together, these findings suggest that, by impairing RAB8A function, pathogenic G2019S LRRK2 deregulates endolysosomal transport and endocytic recycling events.

Dominant-negative RAB7A expression resulted in similar deficits in EGF degradation, accumulation in a RAB4 compartment, and deficits in EGFR recycling, which were all rescued upon expression of active RAB8A. Taken together, these findings suggest that, by impairing RAB8A function, pathogenic G2019S LRRK2 deregulates endolysosomal transport and endocytic recycling events.

Our previous studies revealed that G2019S LRRK2 causes endolysosomal trafficking deficits as measured by following the degradative trafficking of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Such trafficking deficits were reverted by various kinase inhibitors, correlated with a decrease in RAB7A activity, and could be rescued upon active RAB7A expression (21Gómez-Suaga P. Rivero-Ríos P.

Mol. Genet. 2014; 23 (25080504): 6779-679610.1093/hmg/ddu395Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because RAB7A is a crucial regulator of endolysosomal trafficking pathways (25Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S. Lorentzen E. Duddy G. Wilson S. Baptista M.A. Fiske B.K. Fell M.J. Morrow J.A.

A recent large-scale phosphoproteomics study has identified a subset of RAB proteins as in vivo LRRK2 kinase substrates, with RAB8A being one of the most prominent (25Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S. Lorentzen E. Duddy G. Wilson S. Baptista M.A. Fiske B.K. Fell M.J. Morrow J.A.

Phosphomimetic RAB8A variants display impaired interaction with GDP dissociation inhibitor 1/2 (GDI1/2), which is essential to target/extract the protein from the membrane, and with its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rabin8, which is required to activate the protein (25Steger M.

These biochemical studies led to the proposal that LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of RAB8A may cause its inactivation (25Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S.

However, the cellular consequences with respect to intracellular membrane trafficking events remain unknown. RAB8A is localized to the Golgi as well as to a tubular early recycling compartment and is known to regulate post-Golgi exocytic membrane trafficking, retromer-mediated trafficking, and endocytic recycling steps (27Hattula K.

Genet. 2017; 26 (28115417): 729-74110.1093/hmg/ddw413PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that RAB8A may also modulate endolysosomal vesicular trafficking events (31Braun A.C. Hendrick J. Eisler S.A. Schmid S. Hausser A. Olayioye M.A. The Rho-specific GAP protein DLC3 coordinates endocytic membrane trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 (25673874): 1386-139910.1242/jcs.163857Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine a possible link between alterations in RAB8A and the endolysosomal degradative trafficking steps that are impaired by G2019S LRRK2. Because the phosphorylation of RAB8A has been suggested to cause its inactivation (25Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S. Lorentzen E. Duddy G. Wilson S. Baptista M.A. Fiske B.K. Fell M.J. Morrow J.A. Reith A.D. et al.Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson's disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases.Elife. 2016; 5 (26824392)e1281310.7554/eLife.12813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wondered whether pathogenic LRRK2 may cause the reported decrease in RAB7A activity (21Gómez-Suaga P. Rivero-Ríos P. Fdez E. Blanca Ramírez M. Ferrer I. Aiastui A. López De Munain A. Hilfiker S. LRRK2 delays degradative receptor trafficking by impeding late endosomal budding through decreasing Rab7 activity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23 (25080504): 6779-679610.1093/hmg/ddu395Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) via direct phosphorylation. When comparing the phosphorylation of different RAB proteins in vitro, RAB8A was found to serve as an efficient LRRK2 kinase substrate (Fig. S1, A–C). In addition, and as described previously (25Steger M. Tonelli F. Ito G. Davies P. Trost M. Vetter M. Wachter S. Lorentzen E. Duddy G. Wilson S. Baptista M.A. Fiske B.K. Fell M.J. Morrow J.A. Reith A.D. et al.Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson's disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases.Elife. 2016; 5 (26824392)e1281310.7554/eLife.12813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of RAB8A was increased with the pathogenic G2019S variant as compared with WT LRRK2 and was largely abolished when mutating the identified LRRK2 phosphorylation site (T72A) (Fig. S1C). In contrast, other RAB proteins tested, including RAB7A, were not phosphorylated to a significant degree (Fig. S1B). Therefore, the previously reported LRRK2-mediated deficit in endolysosomal trafficking (24Cookson MR. Cellular functions of LRRK2 implicate vesicular trafficking pathways in Parkinson's disease.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2016; 44 (27913668): 1603-161010.1042/BST20160228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) does not seem to be due to direct LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of RAB7A. Upon binding of EGF, the EGFR is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and sorted to lysosomes for degradation in a manner dependent on RAB7 (32Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3 (12461556): 893-90510.1038/nrm973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). EGFR surface availability can be assessed by binding of Alexa555-EGF to cells at 4 °C, and endocytic trafficking and degradation can be followed by quantification of endocytosed Alexa555-EGF over time. HeLa cells were cotransfected with GFP and with either myc-tagged or FLAG-tagged G2019S LRRK2 or with a FLAG-tagged kinase-inactive variant (G2019S-K1906M) of pathogenic LRRK2, respectively, followed by assessment of binding and degradation of fluorescently labeled EGF. Binding of Alexa555-EGF at 4 °C was reduced in the presence of either myc-tagged or FLAG-tagged G2019S LRRK2 but not a kinase-inactive version thereof, indicating that it was tag-independent and due to the LRRK2 kinase activity (Fig. 1A and B). Upon incubation of cells at 37 °C for either 10 or 30 min to monitor fluorescent EGF degradation, a pronounced delay in the clearance of Alexa555-EGF per cell was observed in the presence of G2019S but not kinase-inactive G2019S-K1906M LRRK2, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). A similar pathogenic LRRK2-mediated deficit in EGF clearance was observed when quantifying intracellular fluorescent EGF-positive puncta per area with no change in the fluorescence intensity of the individual dots (Fig. 1, E and F). To further corroborate that the increase in intracellular fluorescent EGF was due to impaired EGFR degradation, biochemical EGFR degradation assays were performed in transfected HEK293T cells expressing G2019S or kinase-inactive G2019S-K1906M LRRK2, respectively. Pathogenic LRRK2 expression did not alter steady-state EGFR expression levels (Fig. 1G). However, and as described previously (24Cookson MR. Cellular functions of LRRK2 implicate vesicular trafficking pathways in Parkinson's disease.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2016; 44 (27913668): 1603-161010.1042/BST20160228Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), cells expressing G2019S LRRK2 displayed a deficit in EGFR degradation as compared with cells expressing kinase-inactive G2019S-K1906M LRRK2 (Fig. 1, H and I). Therefore, pathogenic LRRK2 interferes with the endolysosomal trafficking and degradation of EGF and the EGFR. We next wondered how these LRRK2-mediated endolysosomal trafficking deficits may be modulated by RAB8A. In HeLa cells, GFP-tagged WT RAB8A and GTP-locked, constitutively active RAB8A-Q67L were largely localized to a tubular endocytic recycling compartment partially overlapping with the transferrin receptor, with tubular localization more evident in live or in fixed but only briefly permeabilized cells (Fig. S2, A–C). In contrast, GDP-locked inactive RAB8A-T22N was cytosolic and not properly targeted to a tubular recycling compartment (Fig. S2B). When expressed on their own, neither RAB8A nor RAB8A-Q67L caused alterations in EGF binding or EGFR trafficking, whereas RAB8A-T22N caused a modest decrease in EGF surface binding and a slight delay in EGFR degradation, evident only at t = 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Importantly, the pathogenic G2019S LRRK2–mediated decrease in EGF binding and the delay in EGFR trafficking were fully rescued when expressing RAB8A-Q67L (Fig. 2, C and D). This was not observed with WT RAB8A or with RAB8A-T22N (Fig. 2, C and D), although both WT and RAB8A-Q67L were expressed to similar degrees (Fig. S2D), and none of the RAB8A variants interfered with the coexpression of G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. S3, A and B). In this cell system, and taking into account a roughly 50% transfection efficiency, overexpression of LRRK2 constructs was about 1–1.5-fold above endogenous levels, and overexpression of RAB8A was around 2.5–4-fold above endogenous levels, respectively (Fig. S2, D and E). Rabin8 functions as a GEF for RAB8A and activates it by catalyzing GDP release for subsequent GTP loading (33Hattula K. Furuhjelm J. Arffman A. Peränen J. A Rab8-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor is involved in actin remodeling and polarized membrane transport.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13 (12221131): 3268-328010.1091/mbc.e02-03-0143Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Conversely, Rabin8 is activated by RAB11, which controls vesicle exit from recycling endosomes (34Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J. Merdes A. Slusarski D.C. Scheller R.H.

However, it remains unknown whether such cascade operates in all RAB8A-dependent membrane trafficking events. We therefore tested whether Rabin8 or RAB11 could rescue the LRRK2-mediated deficit in endolysosomal trafficking. Overexpressed Rabin8 was largely cytosolic (Fig. S2B) and had no effect on endolysosomal trafficking when expressed on its own (Fig. 2E and F). However, Rabin8 expression rescued the G2019S LRRK2–mediated deficits in EGF binding and degradation (Fig. 2, G and H) without interfering with the expression levels of G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. S3C), indicating that activating endogenous RAB8A by Rabin8 expression also rescues the LRRK2-mediated endolysosomal trafficking defects. We next analyzed the effects of RAB11 on the LRRK2-mediated deficits in EGFR trafficking. GFP-tagged RAB11 colocalized with transferrin receptor (Fig. S2A). Both WT and GTP-locked active RAB11 (RAB11-Q70L) were membrane-associated, whereas GDP-locked inactive RAB11 (RAB11-S25N) was largely cytosolic (Fig. S2B). When coexpressed with pathogenic LRRK2, both WT and active, but not inactive RAB11, rescued the deficit in EGF binding and degradation (Fig. 3, A and B), but none of them had an effect on their own (Fig. 3, C and D) even though they were expressed to comparable degrees and did not alter the expression levels of G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. S3, D and E). As another means to show that the effects reported here were specific, we analyzed the role of RAB18, an endoplasmic reticulum–resident RAB protein (38Dejgaard S.Y. Murshid A. Erman A. Kizilay O. Verbich D. Lodge R. Dejgaard K. Ly-Hartig T.B. Pepperkok R. Simpson J.C. Presley J.F. Rab18 and Rab43 have key roles in ER-Golgi trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121 (18664496): 2768-278110.1242/jcs.021808Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RAB18 was localized to a reticular pattern reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the nuclear envelope (Fig. S2, A and B) (38Dejgaard S.Y. Murshid A. Erman A. Kizilay O. Verbich D. Lodge R. Dejgaard K. Ly-Hartig T.B. Pepperkok R. Simpson J.C. Presley J.F. Rab18 and Rab43 have key roles in ER-Golgi trafficking.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121 (18664496): 2768-278110.1242/jcs.021808Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Neither WT, GTP-locked (RAB18-Q67L), nor GDP-locked RAB18 (RAB18-S22N) could rescue the pathogenic LRRK2-mediated deficits (Fig. 3, E and F), and they also displayed no effect on their own (Fig. 3, G and H) even though they were expressed to similar degrees and did not affect the levels of coexpressed G2019S LRRK2 (Fig. S3, F and G). Altogether, these data indicate that the RAB11–Rabin8–RAB8A cascade specifically rescues the endolysosomal trafficking defects associated with pathogenic LRRK2. We reasoned that if LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of RAB8A causes its inactivation, a phosphomimetic RAB8A variant should be unable to rescue the delay in EGFR degradation. Thus, we expressed WT RAB8A, the phosphodeficient RAB8A-T72A variant, or the phosphomimetic RAB8A-T72D/RAB8A-T72E variants, respectively. Although WT RAB8A was largely localized to a tubular recycling compartment, the phosphomimetic variants displayed a prominently cytosolic localization, and the phosphodeficient RAB8A variant was also partially cytosolic (Fig. S2F). With the exception of RAB8A-T72E, none of these variants significantly altered EGF binding or EGFR degradation when expressed on their own (Fig"

Synaptic connections between neurons determine how neural circuits process information. Understanding how the specificity of these connections is established is a central challenge in neurobiology. In vertebrates, cell-autonomous genetic programs and neural activity (both evoked and spontaneous) contribute to synapse development. Spontaneous activity has been observed throughout the developing CNS (reviewed in Blankenship and Feller, 2010Blankenship A.G. Feller M.B. Mechanisms underlying spontaneous patterned activity in developing neural circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Retinal waves are the best characterized examples of spontaneous activity (Galli and Maffei, 1988Galli L. Maffei L.

Crair M.C. Role of emergent neural activity in visual map development.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 24: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In mammals, retinal waves occur between the completion of axon guidance and eye opening, and the activity propagates from the retina to higher-order visual centers (Ackman et al., 2012Ackman J.B. Burbridge T.J. Crair M.C. Retinal waves coordinate patterned activity throughout the developing visual system.Nature. 2012; 490: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Significant progress has been made toward characterizing the organizing principles of spontaneous activity in the developing vertebrate brain, and the precise developmental role of this activity is an area of active interest. By contrast to vertebrates, brain development in invertebrates has been thought to occur largely independent of activity. In the Drosophila visual system, photoreceptor neurons can develop the wild-type complement of synapses in a stimulus-independent manner (Hiesinger et al., 2006Hiesinger P.R. Zhai R.G. Zhou Y. Koh T.-W. Mehta S.Q. Schulze K.L. Cao Y. Verstreken P. Clandinin T.R. Fischbach K.-F. et al.Activity-independent prespecification of synaptic partners in the visual map of Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1835-1843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the existence and significance of spontaneous activity during invertebrate brain development remains an open question. Some of the most detailed understanding of brain development in the fly comes from the visual system. Visual information from the compound eye is topographically relayed to the optic neuropils—the lamina, medulla, and lobula complex, each organized into layers and columns. Over 100 different neuronal cell types form precise synaptic connections, typically with several different cell types as revealed by 3D electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions (Takemura et al., 2013Takemura S.Y. Bharioke A. Lu Z. Nern A. Vitaladevuni S. Rivlin P.K. Katz W.T. Olbris D.J. Plaza S.M. Winston P. et al.A visual motion detection circuit suggested by Drosophila connectomics.Nature. 2013; 500: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Visual system development in the fly takes place during the last stage of larval development and the ensuing 100 h of metamorphosis, or pupal development. In the first 50 h after puparium formation (hAPF), a dynamic self-assembly process mediated by cell-surface molecules brings most of the cell types of the visual system to where they belong in the adult brain, ready for synaptogenesis (Hadjieconomou et al., 2011Hadjieconomou D. Timofeev K. Salecker I. A step-by-step guide to visual circuit assembly in Drosophila.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Over the remaining 50 h of pupal development, synapse assembly proceeds in parallel with the upregulation of genes involved in neural activity and new sets of cell recognition molecules (Chen et al., 2014Chen Y. Akin O. Nern A. Tsui C.Y.K. Pecot M.Y. Zipursky S.L.

Little is known about the molecules and mechanisms that coordinate this period of brain development. Here, we report the discovery of stimulus-independent neural activity in the developing Drosophila CNS and its initial characterization in the visual system. We find that the visual system as a whole, all 15 of the individual neuronal cell types examined, as well as astrocytes, participate in patterned, stimulus-independent neural activity (PSINA) during the late stages of circuit assembly. To assess whether neural activity contributes to visual system development in Drosophila, we used an in vivo two-photon imaging protocol (Akin and Zipursky, 2016Akin O. Zipursky S.L. Frazzled promotes growth cone attachment at the source of a Netrin gradient in the Drosophila visual system.eLife. 2016; 5: e20762Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, Langen et al., 2015Langen M.

We expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar) throughout the CNS using a pan-neuronal GAL4 driver. Between 40 and 50 hAPF, the optic lobe is largely inactive, aside from sporadic, isolated activity with no clear spatial or temporal coordination (Video S1). Starting shortly before 50 hAPF, a subset of neuronal processes begins to exhibit periodic bouts of increased fluorescence. By 55 hAPF, processes in all optic neuropils, as well as fibers originating from the central brain, participate in regular 12- to 15-min-long cycles comprising active and silent phases (Figures 1A and 1B ; Video S1). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJkYzRmY2FlMTg4YjgwOThiYmQ5M2RmNmE0NmE5MWRiOCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4OTk4MzQyfQ.PAhh-1mHajNkKtaFIr5_enWJ7KBxC2eFMNe7rbvMnopmmQA7ZgdgHgMbaQsXrXJ0o47Rkj77LVxpsoycITAC6N6Wop3x_2sTKqjkcJe7e_znsjSyrDQYvQiPweMmmFdhl8cjLEb8CQeEcZT6vnDBayl4qj1UZHozmnLBc3j8R1Fg3BhuhK51Z2Py5eQGcScKIv2Y0GiNgF2JkdDC5RVTv-0PMpxbqDxxR7dXxHdx_8E9xtzTEyg9-aS-0HD_ys7ByaTJcfqz-De4ZtTDmtVImWxkkTBcai-AZKCAUMtsAz6w96_o4kuOA4jJttEZtd2fNposj2D9cR2g_yKDnfoLKg Download .mp4 (8.87 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Imaging of Optic Lobe Expressing GCaMP6s Pan-Neuronally, Related to Figure 1Clips from three time periods (pre-PSINA at 45 hAPF, periodic stage at 58 hAPF, and turbulent stage at 70 hAPF) are shown. Images were sampled at 0.4 Hz and playback is 60 frames per second (fps). Scale bar is 40 μm. See Table S1 for genotype used in this figure. The active phase of each cycle comprises several distinct bouts of activity, which we term “sweeps” (Figure 1B). Between 55 and 65 hAPF, or the “periodic stage,” the cycle period remains roughly constant (∼0.001–0.002 Hz), the number of sweeps per cycle and the duration of the active phase increase, and the silent phase decreases (Figure 1C). There were no significant differences between periodicity, sweeps per cycle, or active and silent phase durations between different animals, consistent with the notion that the mechanisms underlying these metrics are stereotyped (Figure S1A). To study the activity beyond 65 hAPF, we moved our expression system to the cn,bw genetic background (Thimann and Beadle, 1937Thimann K.V. Beadle G.W. Development of the eye colors in Drosophila: extraction of the diffusible substances concerned.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1937; 23: 143-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to eliminate retinal pigmentation, making it possible to image through eclosion. We found no significant differences in periodic stage metrics between cn,bw flies and control flies (Figure S1A). By 70 hAPF, the simple temporal pattern is replaced with multiple frequencies reflecting cycles with variable periods (Figure 1D; Video S1). Compared to the periodic stage, during the “turbulent stage,” individual cycles exhibit higher sweeps per cycle and, on average, longer active and shorter silent phases (Figure 1D). The turbulent stage persists until the final hour of pupal development, after which the activity dissipates before eclosion (Figure S1B). Thus, pupal activity is divided into an early periodic stage and a later turbulent stage and continues until the final hour of development (Figure 1E). We next asked whether activity was present beyond the visual system. Recently, a detailed study of motoneuron development showed that peripheral neurons exhibit periodic bouts of activity, starting at 48 hAPF, which grow stronger as development proceeds (Constance et al., 2018Constance W.D. Mukherjee A. Fisher Y.E. Pop S. Blanc E. Toyama Y. Williams D.W. Neurexin and Neuroligin-based adhesion complexes drive axonal arborisation growth independent of synaptic activity.eLife. 2018; 7: e31659Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In pupae, the pan-neuronally driven GCaMP6s was detectable using a widefield epifluorescence microscope, making it possible to image the whole CNS of multiple animals simultaneously. We observed cycles of activity that matched our observations from the two-photon setup in the optic lobes and the central brain (Figure 2A; Video S2). We also saw that the pattern of activity is the same in both sexes (Figure S2A). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiZmZhYjNmOWI3Yjk1NjE4ZTA1MmM2NzA1M2M4MmQzYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4OTk4MzQyfQ.gBR94AcVyc3CynsuKIgae2pYIEutahEQ5RJuEtp5eeXR_EJ_2kFB3AYGIpkBUYvC1PmJXZyqOGuGfhIjy7TjOnePNiClDYYgbKu9ucrHAX2aKnRnBQIQ3wffOvU5pbJnHUOFUCzHbGzCf359fJTCd7cPkUBX01QO2U8Bh-kcwq7uVgxIP2tP1qC3s0emvhgT_ZYhgwnj7fZH-6Fw92l6rFWtpeT7jEdfiaxtFAgGS_S2SvP2rpAFbqPMp2uv-mTrIRqXCXVDPsOVhLLDnxKTJBi06TVFexJnClx8wjeyMRhxqBUEuipz4lv8XG7QaNoAdeWY-MZS8Z9AxrNX4OVQLA Download .mp4 (8.83 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2. Imaging of Whole-Brain Activity in Intact Pupae under a Widefield Epifluorescence Microscope, Related to Figure 2Three animals expressing GCaMP6s pan-neuronally were imaged in parallel. Images were acquired at 16.7 Hz and subsampled at 0.67 Hz for the movie; playback is 60 fps. See Table S1 for genotype used in this figure. Given the broad domain of the activity, we also examined glia using orthogonal expression systems to express GCaMP6s in astrocytes and the red-shifted GECI, jRCaMP1b (Dana et al., 2016Dana H. Mohar B. Sun Y. Narayan S. Gordus A. Hasseman J.P. Tsegaye G. Holt G.T. Hu A. Walpita D. et al.Sensitive red protein calcium indicators for imaging neural activity.eLife. 2016; 5: e12727Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), in all neurons (Figures 2B, S2B, and S2C). Before 55 hAPF, there is no significant correlation between the glial GECI signal and neuronal activity (Figure S2B). This changes during the periodic stage, when the glia exhibit tonic oscillations alongside the neuronal cycles (Figures 2B and S2C). The glial cycles are phase shifted with respect to those of neurons. When neurons are active, astrocytes show a progressive loss in GECI signal, which is rebuilt during the neuronal silent phase (Figures 2B, S2D, and S2E). To establish whether the oscillatory activity ceases in the adult, we used a head-fixed cranial window preparation of adult flies (Aptekar et al., 2014Aptekar J.W. Keles M.F. Mongeau J.-M. Lu P.M. Frye M.A. Shoemaker P.A. Method and software for using m-sequences to characterize parallel components of higher-order visual tracking behavior in Drosophila.Front.

Two-photon calcium imaging from head-fixed Drosophila during optomotor walking behavior.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We observed stimulus-independent activity in newly eclosed (1-hour-old) flies as well as 1- and 5-day-old adults, all of which also had intact, robust responses to visual stimuli (Figure S3A). Stimulus-independent activity in the adult did not engage the entire optic lobe, exhibited fewer sweeps in a given cycle, oscillated at a higher frequency (Figure S3B), and diminished with age. These differences suggest the involvement of different mechanisms in generating the pupal and adult stimulus-independent activities. To assess whether the pupal calcium activity is due to neuronal excitation, we examined the relationship of the pupal GECI signal to neurotransmitter release and changes in membrane potential by co-expressing jRCaMP1b, with either the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (Marvin et al., 2013Marvin J.S. Borghuis B.G. Tian L. Cichon J. Harnett M.T. Akerboom J. Gordus A. Renninger S.L. Chen T.-W. Bargmann C.I. et al.An optimized fluorescent probe for visualizing glutamate neurotransmission.Nat.

Pan-neuronal co-expression of both indicator pairings revealed glutamate release and membrane voltage dynamics that correlated with the GECI signal (Figures S4A and S4B). All neuronal cell types we studied (see below) also display the same GECI activity pattern we describe for pan-neuronal expression. As such, we co-expressed the indicators in a single cell type, the L1 lamina monopolar neuron, a glutamatergic first-order interneuron (Gao et al., 2008Gao S. Takemura S.Y. Ting C.-Y. Huang S. Lu Z.

Hong S.-T. et al.The neural substrate of spectral preference in Drosophila.Neuron. 2008; 60: 328-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We observed strong correlation between the GECI signal and both the iGluSnFR-reported glutamate release (Figure 2C; Video S3) and ArcLight-reported drops in membrane voltage (Figure 2D; Video S4) at the level of individual sweeps. Indeed, cross-correlograms between GECI signals and iGluSnFR or ArcLight showed a sharp peak at a lag time of 0 s, and both cross-correlograms and auto-correlograms showed subsequent peaks at lag times of 12–15 min, reflecting the shared active and silent phases between indicators (Figure S4C). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmNjQwNmJhYzY3YzAwNDJhOWE2MTNmNGViYzFkZTIwZCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4OTk4MzQyfQ.UAyTeOczsJCHI2m2EbnBX7mmyG9vBHR8U8DyV6qI6wQXNzZck4D6BFqzEN_L7f95gnnclz6euPa_Q_sgoJHZe2sdzC-inMUGnp0OFn0LyOB5DeMmqIhWjgWr9uzDebkNvfX_nDv9fjMX2qc_yOk-hgvBD5NSpHrt_Ijj8s5nuC8aK7fSNOjmE4IdylQuTiD-JxlWD9yZXZxQAShfZ5cDl-6Ni7d3vuGdR9G9Yorto_3Z5e1eNtCsUK4mEoAwg7b7uZseUjRQfmEwTfAXHsfjPRkt5Lq75FciIW9-jRrlFApzbpfxqUOo0ebl_b98YugcmzKIBgubsiDy5K8DHNPvkw Download .mp4 (3.04 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S3.

Imaging of L1 Expressing ArcLight (Blue) and jRCaMP1b (Orange), Related to Figure 2Three cycles (starting at 55.3818, 55.6194, and 55.9373 hAPF, or 5, 11, and 19 s into playback) at 55 hAPF are shown. Note that, by contrast to the GECI signal, ArcLight fluorescence intensity decreases during each active phase in response to increases in membrane voltage. Images were sampled at 0.4 Hz and playback is 60 fps. Scale bar is 40 μm. See Table S1 for genotype used in this figure. To pharmacologically manipulate neural activity, we used the head-fixed cranial window preparation in late-stage pupae (90–95 hAPF). We found that calcium activity is severely attenuated with the administration of tetrodotoxin, a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker that inhibits action potentials (Figures 2E and S4D). Together, these results indicate that the GECI signal observed during pupal development reflects neuronal electrical activity. Next, we assessed the contribution of visual stimulus to the activity in three classic vision mutants: hdc (histidine carboxylase, required for the synthesis of the photoreceptor neurotransmitter histamine; Burg et al., 1993Burg M.G.

In all mutants, the activity was still present during pupal development (Figure 2F, norpAnull shown, and Figure S5A). In hdc and ort null animals, the frequency of the periodic stage cycles was comparable to wild-type (Figure S5B), suggesting that histamine signaling in visual processing, or more broadly in the CNS, is not required to drive the activity or establish its rhythm. By contrast, with NorpA, we found a dose-dependent decrease in the frequency of the cycles (Figures S4A and S5B). The null allele used in this work, norpA36 (Pearn et al., 1996Pearn M.T. Randall L.L. Shortridge R.D. Burg M.G. Pak W.L. Molecular, biochemical, and electrophysiological characterization of Drosophila norpA mutants.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4937-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), removes both the retina-specific isoform and a more broadly expressed second isoform of the gene (Kim et al., 1995Kim S. McKay R.R. Miller K. Shortridge R.D. Multiple subtypes of phospholipase C are encoded by the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14376-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We confirmed that retinal function was indeed abolished by testing norpA36 animals for optomotor response to widefield stimulus and closed-loop bar fixation (Figures S5C–S5E). The dose-dependent changes to the period with NorpA may reflect its function as a nonspecialized phospholipase C acting broadly in the developing CNS, or in a subset of cells, to regulate some aspect of intracellular signaling or Ca2+ homeostasis. These results are consistent with the reported timing for the onset of photoreceptor light response at 82 hAPF, which is ∼27 h after the onset of activity (Hardie et al., 1993Hardie R.C. Peretz A. Pollock J.A. Minke B. Ca2+ limits the development of the light response in Drosophila photoreceptors.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1993; 252: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As pupal neuronal activity is independent of visual stimuli, we refer to this phenomenon observed in the development of the Drosophila CNS as “patterned, stimulus-independent neuronal activity”, or PSINA (pronounced ‘see-na’) in the remainder of the text. We assessed PSINA in specific neuronal types in the visual system with two-photon imaging of GCaMP6s in 15 cell types representing some of the major visual system classes (i.e., photoreceptors [R7 and R8], lamina monopolar neurons [L1, L3, and L5], medulla intrinsic neurons [Mi1 and Mi4], distal medulla neurons [Dm3, Dm4, and Dm9], transmedullary neurons [Tm3, Tm4, and Tm9], and T neurons [T4 and T5]) (Figure 3A). During the periodic stage, the temporal pattern of PSINA in all neurons followed the pan-neuronal archetype; as a group, cells of a type cycled through active and silent phases lasting 12–15 min, starting ∼50–55 hAPF and gradually increasing the duration and the sweep complement of the active phase over time (Figure 3B). While the broad temporal characteristics of PSINA are shared, how the activity propagates across the repeated columnar array of a cell type varies. For example, nearly all L3s participate in every sweep of an active phase, while in L1s, fractional participation can change between sweeps (Figures 3C and 3D; Video S5). Further, during a sweep, L3s reach peak intensity within a narrower time window compared to L1s (Figures 3C and 3D). To compare PSINA dynamics between repeated observations of the same cell type and across different cell types, we defined two scalar metrics, “coordination” and “coherence.” Coordination is the average of the fraction of columns that participate in each sweep. Coherence is the largest fraction of columns that peak within the same time point, averaged over all sweeps. Distinct observations of PSINA in L3s all yield comparably high coordination and coherence values in contrast to L1 (Figure 3E). For the 15 cell types we studied, coordination and coherence values from separate observations cluster around means characteristic to each cell type, independent of the specific drivers used for GECI expression or transgenic constitution of the animals (Figures 3F and S6A; Video S6). For most cell types, coordination and coherence are roughly constant during the periodic stage, between 55 and 65 hAPF (Figure S6B). In the few that do show changes, we observe loss of coordination that is attributable to loss of image quality as developing retinal pigmentation degrades the observed GECI signal, particularly with weaker cell-type-specific drivers. A notable exception is L1; here, despite the loss of net signal, both metrics increase over time (Figure S6B), consistent with evolving PSINA dynamics in L1 (Figures S6C and S6D). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJjMmEwMWU4NGRhNDRhZmYwZDgzODAxNzI0ZDRkZjAxOCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4OTk4MzQyfQ.ca_BKdpc7ZizGgp1KHR3799LToSkMyZzyRgOfDDiH7Z_huWcIHkXlkU-Jo-igOj2-mpnnRYFRA0p2aglJov3Xx5XbxUWHndq29J_ZuLpD7OiKHE6yGDC4tFMDcCn7EMDNG3GC_IWivPiyjkjWaVfpMgV7L0oeXjVjJoFrRAPuTn2KF8d2cDBSX-WDuQfOg2xcOx_pvzX8gW6W2cAWKo5HIJKC713XSZ2_mghxIralkKVcClsfRSzrT1ymy7lTgEMDjLRdDQrIbzZBrxhaKIlN6STbXzgwD0mvxQd0C58X1x5h9j6aniyswr4MmjOwnEdHI1SCxIF5ZiQNVuDsS9R1A Download .mp4 (3.57 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S5.

Here we show that NFATc2 expression is associated with an EMT-like transcriptional program and with an invasive melanoma phenotype, as shown by analysis of melanoma cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels, interrogation of the TCGA melanoma dataset and characterization of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry. Gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition of NFATc2 downregulated EMT-related genes and AXL, and suppressed c-Myc, FOXM1, and EZH2. Targeting of c-Myc suppressed FOXM1 and EZH2, while targeting of FOXM1 suppressed EZH2. Inhibition of c-Myc, or FOXM1, or EZH2 downregulated EMT-related gene expression, upregulated MITF and suppressed migratory and invasive activity of neoplastic cells. Stable silencing of NFATc2 impaired melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in SCID mice. In NFATc2+ EZH2+ melanoma cell lines pharmacological co-targeting of NFATc2 and EZH2 exerted strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity, irrespective of BRAF or NRAS mutations and of BRAF inhibitor resistance. These results provide preclinical evidence for a role of NFATc2 in shaping the EMT-like melanoma phenotype and reveal a targetable vulnerability associated with NFATc2 and EZH2 expression in melanoma cells belonging to different mutational subsets."

Methods The population-based Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5,899 (80.5%) individuals out of 7328 eligible individuals aged 40+ years. The participants underwent an ocular and systemic examination. Axial length was measured sonographically (Ultra-compact A/B/P ultrasound system, Quantel Medical, Cournon d'Auvergne, France). Results Biometric data were available for 5707 (96.7%) individuals with a mean age of 58.8±10.6 years (range:40–94 years; 25%, 50%, 75% quartile: 51.0, 58.0, 66.0 years, respectively). Mean axial length was 23.30±1.10 mm (range: 19.02–32.87mm; 95% confidence interval (CI): 21.36–25.89; 25%, 50%, 75% quartile: 22.65mm, 23.23mm, 23.88mm, resp.). Prevalences of moderate myopia (axial length:24.5-<26.5mm) and high myopia (axial length >26.5mm) were 555/5707 (8.7%;95%CI:9.0,10.5) and 78/5707 (1.4%;95%CI:1.1,1.7), respectively. Longer axial length (mean:23.30±1.10mm) was associated (correlation coefficient r2:0.70) with older age (P<0.001;standardized regression coefficient beta:0.14), taller body height (P<0.001;beta:0.07), higher level of education (P<0.001;beta:0.04), higher intraocular pressure (P<0.001;beta:0.03), more myopic spherical refractive error (P<0.001;beta:-0.55), lower corneal refractive power (P<0.001;beta:-0.44), deeper anterior chamber depth (P<0.001;beta:0.20), wider anterior chamber angle (P<0.001;beta:0.05), thinner peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (P<0.001;beta:-0.04), higher degree of macular fundus tessellation (P<0.001;beta:0.08), lower prevalence of epiretinal membranes (P = 0.01;beta-0.02) and pseudoexfoliation (P = 0.007;beta:-0.02) and higher prevalence of myopic maculopathy (P<0.001;beta:0.08). In that model, prevalence of age-related macular degeneration (any type: P = 0.84; early type: P = 0.46), diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.16), and region of habitation (P = 0.27) were not significantly associated with axial length. Conclusions Mean axial length in this typically multi-ethnic Russian study population was comparable with values from populations in Singapore and Beijing. In contrast to previous studies, axial length was not significantly related with the prevalences of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy or region of habitation."

The course of viral infections in patients with acute bronchitis, asthma and COPD can be improved by oral application of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract; however, the mechanism is not well understood. This study investigated the in vitro effect of Pelargonium sidoides radix extract (EPs 7630) on the expression of virus binding cell membrane and host defence supporting proteins on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC). Cells were isolated from patients with severe asthma (n = 6), moderate COPD (n = 6) and non-diseased controls (n = 6). Protein expression was determined by Western-blot and immunofluorescence. Rhinovirus infection was determined by immunofluorescence as well as by polymerase chain reaction. Cell survival was determined by manual cell count after live/death immunofluorescence staining. All parameters were determined over a period of 3 days. The results show that EPs 7630 concentration-dependently and significantly increased hBEC survival after rhinovirus infection. This effect was paralleled by decreased expression of the inducible co-stimulator (ICOS), its ligand ICOSL and cell surface calreticulin (C1qR). In contrast, EPs 7630 up-regulated the expression of the host defence supporting proteins β-defensin-1 and SOCS-1, both in rhinovirus infected and un-infected hBEC. The expression of other virus interacting cell membrane proteins such as MyD88, TRL2/4 or ICAM-1 was not altered by EPs 7630. The results indicate that EPs 7630 may reduce rhinovirus infection of human primary BEC by down-regulating cell membrane docking proteins and up-regulating host defence proteins."

Balanced stem cell renewal and differentiation maintains tissue homeostasis, while their de-regulation enables tumor formation (Meacham and Morrison, 2013Meacham C.E. Morrison S.J. Tumour heterogeneity and cancer cell plasticity.Nature. 2013; 501: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Skin epithelium emerged as a powerful model in which lineage relationships between normal and malignant progenitor cells as well as their differentiated progeny have been determined (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014Blanpain C.

Still, the mechanisms governing self-renewal and squamous differentiation in homeostasis and carcinogenesis remain elusive. Skin epithelium is comprised of epidermal, hair follicle, and sebaceous lineages, which are specified during embryonic development and sustained by stem or progenitor cells throughout life (Benitah and Frye, 2012Benitah S.A.

These differences suggest squamous carcinogenesis might select for stereotypical transcriptional programs, which compromise lineage commitment and thereby cause cell fate transformation, hyper-proliferation, and cell survival.

SOX2 is a cancer-specific regulator of tumour initiating potential in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Still, how SOX2 becomes expressed in SCCs and restricted to TPCs where it supports cell survival and clonal expansion remains unknown. Here, we identify PITX1 as regulator of squamous carcinogenesis in mice and humans. We detect PITX1 in nuclei of TPCs, but not their differentiated progeny. PITX1 binds to and cooperates with SOX2 and TRP63 as they establish a tumor-specific feed-forward circuit to sustain their own transcription and TPC renewal, as they repress Klf4 transcription to blunt squamous differentiation. Conversely, KLF4 competes with PITX1 on bi-stable transcriptional network motifs to inhibit Pitx1, Sox2, and Trp63 transcription, restricting TPC-renewal to the basal SCC layer. This bi-stable transcriptional network supports clonal expansion and aberrant differentiation characteristic of SCCs. Our research uncovers a transcriptional network, which is logically similar, but molecularly distinct, from embryonic stem cells (Young, 2011Young R.A. Control of the embryonic stem cell state.Cell. 2011; 144: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The identification of this cancer-specific mechanism defines SCCs as ectopic growths rather than simply hyper-proliferative tissue, and it suggests that tumors could be effectively targeted with differentiation therapies that minimally affect skin epithelial homeostasis. To determine the PITX1 and SOX2 expression pattern in cutaneous SCCs, we stained fresh frozen mouse and human skins and carcinomas with anti-PITX1 and anti-SOX2 antibodies (Figures 1A–1C). PITX1 and SOX2 were not detectable in normal skin epithelia, but were spotted in DMBA-initiated benign papillomas (Pap), well- and poorly differentiated SCCs, and orthotopic SCC grafts (Figure 1A). A strikingly similar pattern was seen in patient specimens (Figures 1B and S1A), where nuclear PITX1 staining was commonly identified in basal keratoacanthomas (KA), SCC in situ, and malignant SCCs, as well as secondary SCC xenografts. Direct comparisons suggest PITX1 is consistently expressed at all stages of squamous tumorigenesis, preceding SOX2 in benign papillomas and early SCCs, before both proteins become broadly expressed in basal cells of advanced SCCs (Figure 1C). Western blotting (WB) also detected PITX1 and SOX2 in total protein lysates of mouse and human cutaneous (Figures S1B and S1C) and head and neck (HN) SCCs as well as their cell lines (Figures S1D–S1F), but not whole skins. Closer inspection showed PITX1 co-localizes with SOX2 in α6β4 expressing basal SCC cells (Figure 1D), which incorporated EdU in a short pulse (Figure 1E), unlike supra-basal, post-mitotic, and Filaggrin (FLG2)-positive SCC cells (Figure 1F). To directly compare the tumor-forming potential of basal and supra-basal SCC cells, we permanently labeled the parenchymal lineage with a fluorescent tracer (H2BGFP), dissociated SCCs into single-cell suspensions, gated on GFP, and separated the tumor parenchyma into three fractions dependent on their α6 and β1 integrin, as well as transferrin receptor (CD71) expression (Figures 1G and S1G). CD71 labels proliferative cells in epidermis and SCCs and helps to distinguish proliferative progenitor cells from post-mitotic and terminally differentiated SCC cells (Brown et al., 2017Brown J.A. Yonekubo Y. Hanson N. Sastre-Perona A. Basin A. Rytlewski J.A. Dolgalev I. Meehan S. Tsirigos A. Beronja S. Schober M.

Western blotting confirmed SOX2, PITX1, TRP63, and CyclinD1 expression in the GFPhiα6hiβ1hi basal cell fraction, while their loss along with elevated FLG2 expression validated the GFPhiα6loβ1lo fraction as supra-basal, post-mitotic, and differentiated SCC cells (Figure 1H). Limited dilution and orthotopic transplantation of these two fractions indicate a higher tumor initiating potential of PITX1 and SOX2 expressing basal, compared to supra-basal SCC cells (Figure 1I), as previously suggested (Boumahdi et al., 2014Boumahdi S.

To determine if PITX1 is critical for squamous carcinogenesis, we isolated α6hiβ1hi cells from murine SCCs, expanded them briefly on 3T3 feeder layers, and transduced them with lentiviruses (LV) expressing short hairpin RNAs directed against Pitx1 (shPitx1) or scrambled (shScr) control sequences along with a PGK-driven H2BRFP lineage tracer (Beronja et al., 2010Beronja S.

Schober M. SOX2 is a cancer-specific regulator of tumour initiating potential in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We also transduced human SCC lines with LV-shSCR-H2BRFP or LV-shPITX1-H2BRFP. We validated Pitx1 knockdown (KD) by qPCR and western blotting (Figures S1H and S1I) before transplanting these cells into the dermis of Nude mice. Pitx1KD impaired SCC formation in mouse and human (Figures 2A and 2C ). Pitx1KD tumors were unable to expand over time (Figures 2B and 2D), and they failed to initiate secondary SCCs from α6hiβ1hi basal cells after serial transplantation (Figure 2E). Clonal lineage trace and competition experiments also revealed that shPitx1-RFP clones are outcompeted by shScr-GFP clones within 2 weeks (Figures 2F and S1J), and tumor initiation and growth rates diminished even further when we deleted the Pitx1 DNA binding domain (Figures 2G, 2H, S1K, and S1L). To determine how PITX1 promotes squamous carcinogenesis, we fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) α6hiβ1hi TPCs from SCC grafts to identify PITX1 bound gene regulatory elements by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). We also mapped PITX1 bound chromatin in independent, primary TPC cultures before and after Pitx1 deletion. Alignment of short sequence reads against the mm10 genome revealed a highly concordant peak pattern across all PITX1 expressing datasets, comprising 8,545 significantly (p < 0.01) enriched peaks (Figure 3A), located primarily at intergenic and intronic sequences (Figure 3B) with a centrally located PITX family consensus motif (p = 4.2e−211, Figure 3C). These data verify the specificity of our ChIP-experiments, and they suggest that PITX1 binds preferentially to transcriptional enhancers. Because enhancers can be identified by chromatin accessibility and H3K27Ac (Heintzman et al., 2007Heintzman N.D. Stuart R.K. Hon G. Fu Y. Ching C.W. Hawkins R.D. Barrera L.O. Van Calcar S. Qu C.

Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar), we first performed assays for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D.

Global comparisons indicated that chromatin surrounding PITX1 peaks is significantly more accessible in TPCs, compared to EPCs and HFSCs (Figure 3C). Additional cluster analyses revealed similar peak patterns in TPCs of independent SCC models, which were distinct from EPCs and HFSCs (Figure S2A). For example, clusters 2–4 comprise chromatin that is accessible in TPCs and wound epithelial cells, but not HFSCs and EPCs. These gene regulatory elements map distal to their closest transcriptional start sites, consistent with their putative function as transcriptional enhancers (Figure S2B). Further analysis with the genomic regions enrichment of annotations tool (GREAT) (McLean et al., 2010McLean C.Y. Bristor D. Hiller M. Clarke S.L. Schaar B.T. Lowe C.B. Wenger A.M. Bejerano G. GREAT improves functional interpretation of cis-regulatory regions.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2506) Google Scholar) revealed genes associated with clusters 2–3 belong to GO categories of increased skin tumor incidence and squamous carcinogenesis (Figure S3C). Cluster 4 gene sets are affiliated with fatty acid metabolism and reactive oxygen species, which are defining SCC characteristics (Brown et al., 2017Brown J.A. Yonekubo Y. Hanson N. Sastre-Perona A.

These analyses also suggest TPCs (clusters 2–4) are functionally distinct from EPCs (clusters 5–7) and HFSCs (clusters 7–8). Although TPCs express some embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers including SOX2 (Wong et al., 2008Wong D.J. Liu H. Ridky T.W. Cassarino D. Segal E. Chang H.Y. Module map of stem cell genes guides creation of epithelial cancer stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 333-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), we found gene regulatory elements in TPCs are fundamentally distinct from ESCs, as well as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Maza et al., 2015Maza I. Caspi I. Zviran A. Chomsky E. Rais Y. Viukov S. Geula S. Buenrostro J.D. Weinberger L. Krupalnik V. et al.Transient acquisition of pluripotency during somatic cell transdifferentiation with iPSC reprogramming factors.Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; 33: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Figure S2D), and ectodermal and skin epithelial progenitor cells at embryonic days 9 and 13 (Figure S2E) (Fan et al., 2018Fan X.

Cell. 2018; 47: 21-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, skin carcinogenesis may not simply present a developmental de-differentiation process, but it appears to acquire tumor-specific gene regulatory programs de novo. The significant enrichment of PITX and SOX motifs in ATAC cluster 2 (Figure S2F) suggests PITX1 and SOX2 may function to govern SCC-specific enhancers that promote SCC initiation and growth. To test this hypothesis, we intersected PITX1 motif containing ChIP-seq peaks with H3K27Ac profiles of TPCs (Yang et al., 2015Yang H. Schramek D. Adam R.C. Keyes B.E. Wang P. Zheng D. Fuchs E. ETS family transcriptional regulators drive chromatin dynamics and malignancy in squamous cell carcinomas.eLife. 2015; 4: e10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), HFSCs (Adam et al., 2015Adam R.C. Yang H. Rockowitz S. Larsen S.B. Nikolova M. Oristian D.S. Polak L. Kadaja M. Asare A. Zheng D. Fuchs E. Pioneer factors govern super-enhancer dynamics in stem cell plasticity and lineage choice.Nature. 2015; 521: 366-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and EPCs (Rinaldi et al., 2017Rinaldi L. Avgustinova A. Martín M. Datta D. Solanas G. Prats N. Benitah S.A. Loss of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b does not affect epidermal homeostasis but promotes squamous transformation through PPAR-γ.eLife. 2017; 6: 1350Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Figure S2G). Most PITX1 bound chromatin was flanked by H3K27Ac marks in TPCs, while only a subset of PITX1 bound loci were also active in HFSCs and EPCs (Figure 3A). Indeed, Pitx1KD reduced chromatin accessibility (Figure S2H) and H3K27Ac (Figure S2I) preferentially in SCC-specific ATAC clusters, causing a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in H3K27Ac at 3188 enhancers, including 1,541 PITX1 bound sites (Figures S3A and S3A′). However, we also uncovered a significant increase in H3K27Ac at 1,993 enhancers, including 300 PITX1 bound elements (Figures S3B and S3B′). PITX1 may therefore function as either transcriptional enhancer or repressor. To define direct transcriptional PITX1 targets in TPCs, we first used GREAT to identify 3,894 genes with a transcriptional start site in close proximity to PITX1 bound motif containing genomic loci. Next, we compared the transcriptomes of shPitx1 and shScr transduced murine TPCs to identify 3,708 transcripts significantly up- (red) or downregulated (blue) upon Pitx1KD (Figure 3D; Table S1). Among these transcripts are well known regulators of cellular homeostasis (Cdkn1a, Cdkn1b, Mki67, Cdk2, Cdc6), cornified envelope formation (Lce, Flg2), keratinization (Krt1, Krt10, Krt6a, Krt17), epidermal differentiation (Klf4, Ivl, Maf, Grhl3, Gata3, Prdm1, Nfatc1), and apoptosis (Bcl2, Bcl2l11, Bcl2l12) (Figure 3E). By intersecting our PITX1 ChIP-seq results with our differential gene expression data, we uncovered 766 directly activated and 557 directly repressed PITX1 targets (Figure 3F; Table S2). Western blotting confirmed reduced SOX2 and elevated IVL and FLG2 expression in Pitx1KD cultures (Figure 3G), and qPCRs validated significantly reduced Pitx1, Sox2, Myc, and Mki67, along with elevated Klf4, Krt1, Krt10, Lor, and Flg2 expression in shPitx1 compared to shScr TPCs (Figure S3C). Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible shPitx1 KD (Figures S3D and S3E) also inhibited the expansion of already established SCCs (Figure 3H), suggesting PITX1 function is not just critical for SCC formation, but maintenance as well. Consistent with our differential expression data (Figures 3D and 3F), we detected significantly fewer proliferative, MKi67 (Figures 3I and S3F), and phospho-Ser10-histone H3 (Figures 3J and S3G) positive cells in shPitx1 compared to shScr SCCs. We also measured reduced growth (Figures S3H–S3J) and EdU incorporation rates (Figures S3K–S3M) along with increased Caspase 3 activities (Figures S3N–S3Q) in cutaneous and HN-SCC cultures after Pitx1 KD. To test if Pitx1KD simply affects TPC proliferation, or rather self-renewal due to confounding changes in squamous differentiation, we directly compared the relative abundance of basal and supra-basal cell fractions in LV-tetO-shScr and LV-tetO-shPitx1 transduced SCCs, where the parenchymal lineage was marked with H2BGFP as described above (Figures 1G and 1H). We found Pitx1KD depleted tumor propagating α6hiβ1hi SCC cells, while the α6loβ1lo SCC cell fraction expanded (Figure 3K). Consistent with these findings, we also noticed diminished SOX2 and emboldened FLG2 staining in Dox-induced LV-tetO-Pitx1 compared to LV-tetO-Scr control SCCs (Figure 3L) and inducible Pitx1 depletion with CRISPR interference (Figures 3M and S3R–S3T). Collectively, these data suggest PITX1 promotes cell proliferation and its inhibition leads to cell-cycle withdrawal and squamous differentiation. Because cell-cycle withdrawal and differentiation are tightly linked in SCCs, we wondered whether Pitx1 is only detected in the proliferative, but not the quiescent TPC fraction (Brown et al., 2017Brown J.A. Yonekubo Y. Hanson N. Sastre-Perona A. Basin A. Rytlewski J.A. Dolgalev I. Meehan S. Tsirigos A. Beronja S. Schober M.

Interestingly, both TPC cohorts express Pitx1 and Sox2 at similar levels (Figure S3U), suggesting that they prevent TPC differentiation independent of cell proliferation. To determine if PITX1 controls gene transcription on its own, or together with other TFs, we used"

Accurate defect prediction algorithms help to find more defects with limited effort. To improve the accuracy of defect prediction, in this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach for effort-aware just-in-time defect prediction. The key idea of the proposed approach is that neural network and deep learning could be exploited to select useful features for defect prediction because they have been proved excellent at selecting useful features for classification and regression. First, we preprocess ten numerical metrics of code changes, and then feed them to a neural network whose output indicates how likely the code change under test contains bugs. Second, we compute the benefit cost ratio for each code change by dividing the likelihood by its size. Finally, we rank code changes according to their benefit cost ratio. Evaluation results on a well-known data set suggest that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on each of the subject projects. It improves the average recall and popt by 15.6% and 8.1%, respectively."

It also has been considered as a promising eco-bioindustrial plant, which can offer raw material and gene for the biomass industry. However, lack of germplasm resources and genetic diversity information of M. lutarioriparius have become the bottleneck that prevents the stable and further development of the biomass industry. In the present study, genetic diversity of 153 M. lutarioriparius individuals nine populations was studied using 27 Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers. High polymorphic bands (97.67%), polymorphic information content (0.26) and allele number (1.88) showed SCoT as a reliable marker system for genetic analysis in M. lutarioriparius. At the species, the percentage of polymorphic loci [PPL] was 97.2%, Nei's gene diversity [H] was 0.36, Shannon index [I] was 0.54 and Expected Heterozygosity [He] was 0.56. Genetic variation within populations (84.91%) was higher than among populations (15.09%) based on analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Moderate level of genetic differentiation was found in M. lutarioriparius populations (Fst = 0.15), which is further confirmed by STRUCTURE, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis that could reveal a clear separation between groups of the north and south of Yangtze River. The gene flow of the populations within the respective south and north of Yangtze River area was higher, but lower between the areas. There was no obvious correlation between genetic distance and geographic distance. The breeding systems, geographical isolation and fragmented habitat of M. lutarioriparius may be due to the high level of genetic diversity, moderate genetic differentiation, and the population, structure. The study further suggests some measure for conservation of genetic resources and provides the genetic basis for improving the efficiency of breeding based on the results of diversity analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2914008351,"The hormone relaxin is considered a potential therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have previously shown that a potential limitation to relaxin-based IPF therapy is decreased expression of a relaxin receptor, relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), in IPF fibroblasts. The mechanism that down-regulates RXFP1 in IPF remains unclear. To determine whether microRNAs (miRs) regulate RXFP1 gene expression, here we employed a bioinformatics approach to identify miRs predicted to target RXFP1 and identified a putative miR-144-3p target site in the RXFP1 mRNA.

Furthermore, we found that miR-144-3p is up-regulated in IPF fibroblasts compared with lung fibroblasts from healthy donors. Transforming growth factor β increased miR-144-3p expression in both healthy and IPF lung fibroblasts in a SMAD family 2/3 (SMAD2/3)-dependent manner, and Jun proto-oncogene AP-1 transcription factor subunit (AP-1) was required for constitutive miR-144-3p expression. Overexpression of an miR-144-3p mimic significantly reduced RXFP1 mRNA and protein levels and increased expression of the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in healthy lung fibroblasts. IPF lung fibroblasts transfected with anti-miR-144-3p had increased RXFP1 expression and reduced α-SMA expression. Of note, a lentiviral luciferase reporter carrying the WT 3′ UTR of RXFP1 was significantly repressed in IPF lung fibroblasts, whereas a reporter carrying a mutated miR-144-3p–binding site exhibited less sensitivity toward endogenous miR-144-3p expression, indicating that miR-144-3p down-regulates RXFP1 in IPF lung fibroblasts by targeting its 3′ UTR.

To our knowledge, there are no data on the regulation of RXFP1 by particular transcription factors. One relatively unexplored mechanism to regulate RXFP1 expression is the role of microRNAs. MicroRNAs are noncoding small RNAs, about 22 nucleotides in length, that can bind to the 3′ UTR of target genes to repress their translation and/or induce degradation of target gene mRNA by incomplete base pairing. The role of mesenchymal cell (fibroblast) microRNA expression and function in pulmonary fibrosis has been demonstrated in several recent studies (13Montgomery R.L. Yu G. Latimer P.A. Stack C.

Embryol. 2013; 118 (24640558): 10-12PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that dysregulation of microRNA expression in IPF fibroblasts regulates RXFP1 gene expression. Previously, we found that RXFP1 gene expression in IPF lungs was negatively correlated with pulmonary function (7Tan J. Tedrow J.R. Dutta J.A. Juan-Guardela B. Nouraie M. Chu Y. Trejo Bittar H.

In this new analysis, we calculated GAP (genomic-age-pulmonary function) stages (1 to 3) for the IPF patients in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) dataset (Fig. 1, A–C, n = 134). This three-stage system has been validated and is associated with increasing 1-year mortality in IPF (7Tan J. Tedrow J.R. Dutta J.A. Juan-Guardela B. Nouraie M. Chu Y. Trejo Bittar H. Ramani K.

Here, we plotted RXFP1 (and RXFP2 and RXFP3) gene expression data as a function of GAP stage. For all three genes, missing pulmonary function data (N = 13/134) were imputed to the severest pulmonary function category. We have found that patients in the highest GAP stage had the lowest RXFP1 gene expression. This was not observed for RXFP2 and -3. These data indicate that patients with the lowest RXFP1 gene expression were in the group of patients predicted to have the highest mortality. Because a reduction in RXFP1 gene expression in the lung predicts reduced pulmonary function (7Tan J. Tedrow J.R. Dutta J.A. Juan-Guardela B. Nouraie M. Chu Y. Trejo Bittar H. Ramani K. Biswas P.S.

Cells were processed for quantitative RT-PCR at several time points. We determined that the half-life of RXFP1 from donor lung fibroblasts is ∼19.5 h, whereas that of TGFβ-treated donor lung fibroblasts is ∼13.6 h (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, we found that the half-life of RXFP1 from IPF lung fibroblasts is ∼33 h, whereas that of TGFβ-treated IPF lung fibroblasts is ∼11 h (Fig. 1E). The rate of degradation of RXFP1 in response to TGFβ is slightly faster in IPF lung fibroblasts compared with donor lung fibroblasts. When we compare IPF and donor lung fibroblasts for RXFP1 at baseline, we noted that the expression level of RXFP1 expression at baseline is much lower in IPF lung fibroblasts compared with donor lung fibroblasts (Fig. 1F). Taken together, this led us to speculate that post-transcriptional mechanisms may regulate RXFP1 expression in IPF fibroblasts and in response to TGFβ. To understand potential post-transcriptional mechanisms that may regulate RXFP1 transcription in lung fibroblasts, we employed several public database prediction programs to identify potential microRNA species that may regulate RXFP1 gene expression. MiRanda (microrna.org) 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. and Targetscan 7.0 predict that RXFP1 is a potential target of miR-144-3p (Fig. 2A). miR-144-3p is highly conserved in primates and lower vertebrates. Although the RXFP1 target site for miR-144-3p is conserved among primates (human, chimpanzee, rhesus, and bovine genomes), it is not conserved in mouse. Because hsa–miR-144-3p is predicted to have strong binding to 3′ UTR of hRXFP1 mRNA, we prioritized hsa–miR-144-3p for further testing. First, to determine whether miR-144-3p can regulate RXFP1 mRNA and protein levels, we transfected donor and IPF lung fibroblasts with miR-144-3p mimic and processed these cells for quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting of RXFP1 (Fig. 2, B and C). Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that miR-144-3p overexpression resulted in a significant down-regulation of RXFP1 mRNA levels in donor lung fibroblasts (Fig. 2B). We also show by qRT-PCR that IPF lung fibroblasts have significantly lower basal levels of RXFP1 mRNA compared with donor lung fibroblasts, confirming our previous findings (Fig. 2B) (7Tan J. Tedrow J.R. Dutta J.A. Juan-Guardela B. Nouraie M. Chu Y. Trejo Bittar H. Ramani K. Biswas P.S. Veraldi K.L. Kaminski N. Zhang Y. Kass D.J.

To verify miR-144-3p specificity on expression of RXFP1, we determined whether the effect manifested with another relaxin receptor gene, RXFP2. In silico, miR-144-3p is not predicted to target either RXFP2 or RXFP3. Expression of human RXFP2 was unaffected by miR-144-3p overexpression compared with control mimic based on qRT-PCR (Fig. 2C). We further analyzed if the effects of miR-144-3p on RXFP1 were detectable at the protein level. Using Western blotting and densitometry analyses, we found that forced expression of miR-144-3p mimic in donor and IPF lung fibroblasts resulted in a significant repression of RXFP1 protein levels (Fig. 2, D–F). We previously found that the loss of RXFP1 is also associated with increased expression of the myofibroblast differentiation marker, α-SMA (7Tan J. Tedrow J.R. Dutta J.A. Juan-Guardela B. Nouraie M. Chu Y. Trejo Bittar H. Ramani K. Biswas P.S. Veraldi K.L. Kaminski N. Zhang Y. Kass D.J. Expression of RXFP1 is decreased in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: implications for relaxin-based therapies.Am. J. Respir. Crit.

To determine whether miR-144-3p–mediated loss of RXFP1 is associated with α-SMA expression, we further analyzed its role in the response to miR-144-3p overexpression. We transfected donor and IPF fibroblasts with miR-144-3p mimic or negative control mimic. In Western blotting and densitometry analysis for α-SMA levels for the experiment from Fig. 2E and Fig. S2A; we found that miR-144-3p overexpression resulted in increased levels of α-SMA in donor lung fibroblasts; however, α-SMA levels increased significantly in IPF lung fibroblasts over baseline (Fig. 2F). Next, we determined if RXFP1 protein levels can be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in donor lung fibroblasts using a range of mimic concentrations (0–10 nm). Western blotting and densitometry analysis show that miR-144-3p mimic decreased RXFP1 with increasing concentrations of miR-144-3p mimic, whereas completely inhibiting expression of RXFP1 at a concentration of 10 nm in donor lung fibroblasts (Fig. 3, A–C and Fig. S2B). Although RXFP1 levels decreased, α-SMA levels increased in a dose-dependent manner as well (Fig. 3C). To determine the effects of miR-144-3p mimic on the contractility of lung fibroblasts, we treated lung fibroblasts from healthy donors with lentiviral particles carrying a miR-144-3p mimic vector, a miR-144-3p mismatch mutant vector, or a GFP control vector (Fig. 3, D and E). Forty-eight hours after lentiviral infection, we evaluated the contractility using gel contraction assays, donor fibroblasts infected with lentiviral miR-144-3p mimic vector demonstrated greater gel contraction (∼55% reduction in area) compared with lenti-GFP control vector. The mismatch mutant did not have any significant effect on gel contraction. TGFβ increased the gel contraction of donor fibroblasts with lenti-GFP, but this TGFβ effect was not enhanced with lenti-miR-144-3p mimic vector. These data indicate that miR-144-3p expression globally increases myofibroblast contractility. Lung biopsies were obtained from IPF subjects (n = 5) and processed for in situ hybridization (Fig. 4A) employing probes against the small nuclear RNA U6, miR-144-3p, and a scrambled control. Staining for the U6 positive control was present in nearly all cells observed in a nuclear pattern. No detectable staining was present with the scrambled control. The miR-144-3p probe showed staining in many cell types including fibroblasts in fibroblastic foci, the hallmark lesion of IPF. If miR-144-3p regulates RXFP1, we reasoned that miR-144-3p levels should be higher in response to TGFβ and in IPF. First, we determined the levels of miR-144-3p in IPF and donor fibroblasts using quantitative RT-PCR with and without TGFβ stimulation. We found that IPF fibroblasts showed >70-fold higher levels of mature miR-144-3p (Fig. 4B) compared with donor lung fibroblast controls. In donor lung fibroblasts, TGFβ increased miR-144-3p levels ∼5-fold. The already elevated levels of miR-144-3p in IPF fibroblasts increased further with TGFβ stimulation (∼1.4-fold). These data indicate that expression of miR-144-3p is downstream of TGFβ stimulation and is significant in IPF compared with donor controls. To determine the effect on miR-144-3p following actinomycin-D, we re-analyzed the experiments performed in Fig. 1C, and we found the half-life of miR-144-3p in IPF lung fibroblasts to be ∼18 h, whereas it is ∼12 h in response to TGFβ (Fig. S2C). We have previously observed that chemical inhibition of Smad signaling could block the effects of TGFβ on RXFP1 expression. In this experiment, we determined if silencing of Smad2/3 would decrease miR-144-3p expression. We silenced Smad2 and Smad3 individually as well as in combination by siRNA. Although vehicle treatment had no effect, TGFβ significantly increased the expression levels of mature miR-144-3p both in donor and IPF fibroblasts. Silencing of Smad2 and/or Smad3 reversed the effects of TGFβ on donor and IPF fibroblasts (Fig. 4, C and D). We confirmed that we achieved significant silencing of Smad2/3 gene expression in vehicle and TGFβ-treated cells. We did observe that silencing of Smad2/3 was not sufficient to bring the levels of miR-144-3p down compared with the levels of expression in vehicle-treated controls for donor and IPF lung fibroblasts (Fig. 4, E and F). This led us to speculate that there must be an additional mechanism of transcriptional regulation for maintaining basal (constitutive) expression of miR-144-3p in lung fibroblasts. Innate immune signaling and inflammation have recently been associated with myofibroblast differentiation in IPF (21O'Dwyer D.N. Ashley S.L. Moore B.B.

Furthermore, to determine whether AP-1 may be involved in regulation of miR-144-3p in lung fibroblasts, we silenced c-Jun or c-Fos by siRNA (Fig. 5, A and B).

Successful silencing of c-Jun and c-Fos for this experiment are shown in Fig. 5, C and D. In gain-of-function experiments, overexpression of c-Jun using a lentiviral vector carrying c-Jun gene resulted in ∼6.4-fold increase in miR-144-3p levels (Fig. 6B) compared with miR-186-5p (Fig. 6C), an endogenous control microRNA that is not known to be affected by c-Jun. Furthermore, we showed that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is known to activate the AP-1 complex, significantly augmented the levels of mature miR-144-3p by ∼3.8-fold (Fig. 6A). We found that IPF fibroblasts showed slightly higher expression of c-Jun and c-Fos (∼2.3- and ∼2.9-fold, respectively) when compared with that of donor fibroblasts (Fig. 5, E and F).

https://openalex.org/W2914141535,"The tropical rain forests of northwest South America fall within the Chocó-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE). The CGE is one of 25 global biodiversity hotspots prioritized for conservation due to its high biodiversity and endemism as well as threats due to deforestation. The analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change within the CGE using remotely sensed imagery is challenging because this area is considered to be one of the rainiest places on the planet (hence high frequency of cloud cover). Furthermore, the availability of high-resolution remotely sensed data is low for developing countries before 2015. Using the Random Forest ensemble learning classification tree system, we developed annual LULC maps in the CGE from 2002 to 2015 using a time series of cloud-free MODIS vegetation index products. The MODIS imagery was processed through a Gaussian weighted filter to further correct for cloud pollution and matched to visual interpretations of land cover and land use from available high spatial resolution imagery (WorldView-2, Quick Bird, Ikonos and GeoEye-1). Validation of LULC maps resulted in a Kappa of 0.87 (Sd = 0.008). We detected a gradual replacement of forested areas with agriculture (mainly grassland planted to support livestock grazing), and secondary vegetation (agriculture reverting to forest) across the CGE. Forest loss was higher between 2010-2015 when compared to 2002-2010. LULC change trends, deforestation drivers, and reforestation transitions varied according to administrative organization (countries: Panamanian CGE, Colombian CGE, and Ecuadorian CGE)."
https://openalex.org/W2911555270,"Background Non-cardiac chest pain is common and there is no formal recommendation on what diagnostic tests to use to identify underlying diseases after an acute coronary syndrome has been ruled out. Objective To evaluate the diagnostic tests, treatment recommendations and initiated treatments in patients presenting with non-cardiac chest pain to the emergency department (ED). Methods Single-center, retrospective medical chart review of patients presenting to the ED. Included were all medical records of patients aged 18 years and older presenting to the ED with chest pain and a non-cardiac discharge diagnosis between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011. Information on the diagnosis, diagnostic tests performed, treatment initiated and recommendation for further diagnostic testing or treatment were extracted. The primary outcomes of interest were the final diagnosis, diagnostic tests, and treatment recommendations. A formal ACS rule out testing was defined as serial three troponin testing. Results In total, 1341 ED admissions for non-cardiac chest pain (4.2% of all ED admissions) were analyzed. Non-specific chest pain remained the discharge diagnosis in 44.7% (n = 599). Identified underlying diseases included musculoskeletal chest pain (n = 602, 44.9%), pulmonary (n = 30, 2.2%), GI-tract (n = 35, 2.6%), or psychiatric diseases (n = 75, 5.6%). In 81.4% at least one troponin test and in 89% one ECG were performed. A formal ACS rule out troponin testing was performed in 9.2% (GI-tract disease 14.3%, non-specific chest pain 14.0%, pulmonary disease 10.0%, musculoskeletal chest pain 4.7%, and psychiatric disease 4.0%). Most frequently analgesics were prescribed (51%). A diagnostic test with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) was prescribed in 20% (mainly in gastrointestinal diseases). At discharge, over 72 different recommendations were given, ranging from no further measures to extensive cardiac evaluation. Conclusion In this retrospective study, a formal work-up to rule out ACS was found in a minority of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain of non-cardiac origin. A wide variation in diagnostic processes and treatment recommendations reflect the uncertainty of clinicians on how to approach patients after a cardiac cause was considered unlikely.

During complex naturalistic stimulation, however, multiple features may simultaneously affect neuronal responses, which complicates the readout of individual features. To investigate feature representation under complex stimulation, we studied how direction-selective ganglion cells in salamander retina respond to texture motion where direction, velocity, and spatial pattern inside the receptive field continuously change. We found that the cells preserve their direction preference under this stimulation, yet their direction encoding becomes ambiguous due to simultaneous activation by luminance changes. The ambiguities can be resolved by considering populations of direction-selective cells with different preferred directions. This gives rise to synergistic motion decoding, yielding more information from the population than the summed information from single-cell responses. Strong positive response correlations between cells with different preferred directions amplify this synergy. Our results show how correlated population activity can enhance feature extraction in complex visual scenes."
https://openalex.org/W2911944131,"Introduction Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive lung disease with a fatal prognosis to whose rapid evolution multiple comorbidities may contribute, one of the most common being obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There are several potential factors and conditions for the emergence of a cognitive deficit in relation to IPF or associated morbidities. Objectives The goals of this study were to assess cognition in patients with IPF in stable phase and to identify clinical cognition modifiers. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 23 patients with IPF were evaluated using Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), an instrument for detecting mild cognitive impairments and were screened for OSA through overnight cardiorespiratory polygraphy and for anxiety and depression with three specific scale (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale: GAD-7; the Patient Health Questionnaire: PHQ-9; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: HADS). Results MoCA score was lower in patients with IPF when compared to controls subjects (24 [21,26] vs. 27 [26,28], p = 0.003) but not as significantly as in COPD patients (21 [18.8,23.3], p<0.0001). OSA was diagnosed in 19 (82.6%) IPF patients, 12 patients showed the presence of moderate-severe forms (63.15%). IPF patients with cognitive impairment (MoCA<23) exhibit a higher severity of OSA (apneea hypopnea index–AHI: 33.0±19.1 vs. 12.44±8.2, p = 0.018), and a higher Epworth score (7.1±3.3 vs. 4.3±1.8, p = 0.013). Anxiety and depression scores were not correlated with MoCA results. Conclusions Impaired cognition in patients with IPF is mild and affect the areas of visuospatial abilities, language and working memory. OSA could be a possible predictor of IPF cognition deficit. Given the high prevalence of multiple types of sleep disorders in IPF patients, these should be investigated at least by cardiorespiratory polygraphy."
https://openalex.org/W2911984921,"In this work, we establish that maintenance and inspection are a risk factor in helicopter accidents. Between 2005 and 2015, flawed maintenance and inspection were causal factors in 14% to 21% of helicopter accidents in the U.S. civil fleet. For these maintenance-related accidents, we examined the incubation time from when the maintenance error was committed to the time when it resulted in an accident. We found a significant clustering of maintenance accidents within a short number of flight-hours after maintenance was performed. Of these accidents, 31% of these accidents occurred within the first 10 flight-hours. This is reminiscent of infant mortality in reliability engineering, and we characterized it as maintenance error infant mortality. The last quartile of maintenance-related accidents occurred after 60 flight-hours following maintenance and inspection. We then examined the “physics of failures” underlying maintenance-related accidents and analyzed the prevalence of different types of maintenance errors in helicopter accidents. We found, for instance, that the improper or incomplete (re)assembly or installation of a part category accounted for the majority of maintenance errors with 57% of such cases, and within this category, the incorrect torquing of the B-nut and incomplete assembly of critical linkages were the most prevalent maintenance errors. We also found that within the failure to perform a required preventive maintenance and inspection task category, the majority of the maintenance programs were not executed in compliance with federal regulations, nor with the manufacturer maintenance plan. Maintenance-related accidents are particularly hurtful for the rotorcraft community, and they can be eliminated. This is a reachable objective when technical competence meets organizational proficiency and the collective will of all the stakeholders in this community. We conclude with a set of recommendations based on our findings, which borrow from the ideas underlying the defense-in-depth safety principle to address this disquieting problem."
https://openalex.org/W2912779889,"The use of Beauveria bassiana in biological control of agricultural pests is mainly hampered by environmental factors, such as elevated temperatures and low humidity. These limitations, further amplified in a global warming scenario, could nullify biological control strategies based on this fungus. The identification of thermotolerant B. bassiana isolates represents a possible strategy to overcome this problem. In this study, in order to maximize the probability in the isolation of thermotolerant B. bassiana, soil samples and infected insects were collected in warm areas of Syria. The obtained fungal isolates were tested for different biological parameters (i.e., growth rate, sporulation and spore germination) at growing temperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C. Among these isolates (eight from insects and 11 from soil samples), the five with the highest growth rate, spore production and germination at 30°C were tested for their entomopathogenicity through in vivo assays on Ephestia kuehniella larvae. Insect mortality induced by the five isolates ranged from 31% to 100%. Two isolates, one from Phyllognathus excavatus and one from soil, caused 50% of the larval mortality in less than four days, reaching values exceeding 92% in ten days. These two isolates were molecularly identified as B. bassiana sensu stricto by using three markers (i.e., ITS, Bloc and EF1-α). Considering these promising results, further studies are ongoing, testing their efficiency in field conditions as control agents for agricultural insect pests in Mediterranean and Subtropical regions."
https://openalex.org/W2913926516,"The influence of physical oceanographic processes on the dispersal of larvae is critical for understanding the ecology of species and for anticipating settlement into fisheries to aid long-term sustainable harvest. This study examines the mechanisms by which ocean currents shape larval dispersal and supply to the continental shelf-break, and the extent to which circulation determines settlement patterns using Sagmariasus verreauxi (Eastern Rock Lobster, ERL) as a model species. Despite the large range of factors that can impact larval dispersal, we show that within a Western Boundary Current system, mesoscale circulation explains broad spatio-temporal patterns of observed settlement including inter-annual and decadal variability along 500 km of coastline. To discern links between ocean circulation and settlement, we correlate a unique 21- year dataset of observed lobster settlement (i.e., early juvenile & pueruli abundance), with simulated larval settlement. Simulations use outputs of an eddy-resolving, data-assimilated, hydrodynamic model, incorporating ERL spawning strategy and larval duration. The latitude where the East Australian Current (EAC) deflects east and separates from the continent determines the limit between regions of low and high ERL settlement. We found that years with a persistent EAC flow have low settlement while years when mesoscale eddies prevail have high settlement; in fact, mesoscale eddies facilitate the transport of larvae to the continental shelf-break from offshore. Proxies for settlement based on circulation features observed with satellites could therefore be useful in predicting broadscale patterns of settlement orders of magnitudes to guide harvest limits."

This study examined the association between current shift work status, frequency and duration of night shift work, chronotype, and metabolic risk factors in a population of health care workers.Anthropometrics, questionnaires, and blood samples were collected from 503 shift working and 93 non-shift working health care workers employed in hospitals. Body mass index, waist circumference, cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL), triglycerides, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured. Associations of current shift work, frequency (non-night shift worker, 1-2, 3-4, ≥5 night shifts/month) and duration of night shift work (non-night shift workers, <10, 10-19, ≥20 years), and shift workers' chronotype, with metabolic risk factors were studied using linear regression analysis.Compared to non-shift workers, shift workers' total cholesterol level was 0.38 mmol/L lower (95%-CI = -0.73 --0.04) and LDL cholesterol was 0.34 mmol/L lower (95%-CI = -0.60 --0.08). For all other metabolic risk factors, no differences were found. The association between shift work and LDL cholesterol was especially found among shift workers working night shifts for ≥20 years (B = -0.49 (95%-CI = -0.78 --0.19)). No differences were found for night shift frequency and chronotype.In this population of health care workers employed in hospitals, no evidence for differences in metabolic risk factors was observed that could underlie a link between shift work and cardio-metabolic diseases. Further research using different aspects of shift work to study the association with metabolic risk factors is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2912701107,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in multiple aspects of biology. Dicer, an RNase III endonuclease, is essential for the biogenesis of miRNAs, and the germ cell-specific Dicer1 knockout mouse shows severe defects in gametogenesis. How miRNAs regulate germ cell development is still not fully understood. In this study, we identified germ cell-specific miRNAs (miR-741-3p, miR-871-3p, miR-880-3p) by analyzing published RNA-seq data of mouse. These miRNA genes are contiguously located on the X chromosome near other miRNA genes. We named them X chromosome-linked miRNAs (XmiRs). To elucidate the functions of XmiRs, we generated knockout mice of these miRNA genes using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing system. Although no histological abnormalities were observed in testes of F0 mice in which each miRNA gene was disrupted, a deletion covering miR-871 and miR-880 or covering all XmiRs (ΔXmiRs) resulted in arrested spermatogenesis in meiosis in a few seminiferous tubules, indicating their redundant functions in spermatogenesis. Among candidate targets of XmiRs, we found increased expression of a gene encoding a WNT receptor, FZD4, in ΔXmiRs testis compared with that in wildtype testis. miR-871-3p and miR-880-3p repressed the expression of Fzd4 via the 3'-untranslated region of its mRNA. In addition, downstream genes of the WNT/β-catenin pathway were upregulated in ΔXmiRs testis. We also found that miR-871, miR-880, and Fzd4 were expressed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids, and overexpression of miR-871 and miR-880 in germ stem cells in culture repressed their increase in number and Fzd4 expression. Previous studies indicated that the WNT/β-catenin pathway enhances and represses proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia, respectively, and our results consistently showed that stable β-catenin enhanced GSC number. In addition, stable β-catenin partially rescued reduced GSC number by overexpression of miR-871 and miR-880. The results together suggest that miR-871 and miR-880 cooperatively regulate the WNT/β-catenin pathway during testicular germ cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2911397119,"Traditionally, the acquisition of manual skills in most dental schools worldwide is based on exercises on plastic teeth placed in a ""phantom head simulator"". No manual trainings are done at home. Studies revealed that preliminary training of one motoric task leads to significant improvement in performance of the required motoric task that has similar components. Performing tasks indirectly via a dental mirror are complicated for the young dental students. We hypothesized that instructed training of basic skills required in dentistry at home on a tool simulating the phantom laboratory will improve the capabilities of the students and will be reflected by their clinical grades.We developed a portable tool PhantHome which is composed of jaws, gingival tissue, rubber cover and a compatible stand. Specific teeth produced by a 3D printer with drills in different directions were placed in both jaws. Students were requested to insert pins by using tweezers and dental mirror according to instructions initiating with easy tasks and continue to ones that are more complicated. 106 first clinical year dental students participated in the study; 65 trained only in the traditional phantom lab (control). 41 trained at home by the PhantHome tool two weeks before and 2 months during the initial stage of phantom lab. The students grades routinely provided in the phantom laboratory at different stages were compared.Students who trained with the portable tool performed better than the control group in the first direct and second indirect preparations (p<0.05). These exams were taken when the PhantHome was available to the students. Then, the tool was returned and the phantom course continued regularly. We believe that this is why no differences between the grades of the groups were observed further on.Training by the PhantHome improves motor skills and consequently the clinical performances."
https://openalex.org/W2912277094,"Metalworking fluids (MWF) are water- or oil-based liquids to cool and lubricate tools, work pieces and machines, inhibit corrosion and remove swarf. One of the major problems in the MWF industry is bacterial growth as bacterial enzymes can cause MWF degradation. In addition, bacteria can form biofilms which hamper the functioning of machines. Last but not least, some bacterial by-products are toxic (e.g. endotoxins) and present potential health risks for metalworking machine operators via the formation of aerosols. Therefore, a novel fast yet accurate analytical method to evaluate and predict the antibacterial capacity of MWF would be an important asset. As such a tool is currently lacking, the present study aimed to develop a protocol based on flow cytometry (FCM) to assess the antibacterial potential of newly developed MWF independent of bacterial growth. Results of this novel method were compared to a biochallenge test currently used in MWF industry and also to traditional plate counts. Our results represent a proof-of-principle that FCM can reliably predict the antibacterial capacity of MWF already within one day of incubation with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, being substantially faster than the current growth-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W2914092098,"Hypovascular pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (hypo-PNETs) are often misdiagnosed as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the treatment options and prognosis of PNETs and PDAC are substantially different. This retrospective study differentiated hypo-PNETs from PDAC using contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT). Clinical data and CE-CT findings, including tumor location, size, boundary, pancreatic duct dilatation, local invasion or metastases, tumor contrast enhancement, and tumor-to-pancreas enhancement ratio, were compared between 39 PDACs and 18 hypo-PNETs. At CT imaging, hypo-PNETs showed a higher frequency of a well-defined margin and lower frequencies of pancreatic duct dilatation and local invasion or metastasis when compared with PDAC (p < 0.05 for all). The mean attenuation of hypo-PNETs at the arterial and portal venous phase was significantly higher than that of PDAC (p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively). Similar results were observed in tumor-to-pancreas enhancement ratio. Tumor attenuation and tumor-to-pancreas enhancement ratio at the arterial phase showed the largest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.888 and 0.812 with 83.3–88.9% of sensitivity and 61.6–77.0% of specificity. Pancreatic duct dilatation, local invasion or metastasis, and tumor attenuation at the portal venous phase also showed acceptable AUC (0.703–0.748). Thus CE-CT features, especially the enhancement degree at the arterial phases, may be useful for differentiating hypo-PNETs from PDAC using CE-CT."
https://openalex.org/W2914896349,"After pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) implementation, the number of acute otitis media (AOM) episodes has decreased, but AOM still remains among the most common diagnoses in childhood. From 2% to 17% of cases of AOM feature spontaneous perforation of the tympanic membrane (SPTM). The aim of this study was to describe the bacteriological causes of SPTM 5 to 8 years years after PCV13 implementation, in 2010. From 2015 to 2018, children with SPTM were prospectively enrolled by 41 pediatricians. Middle ear fluid was obtained by sampling spontaneous discharge. Among the 470 children with SPTM (median age 20.8 months), no otopathogen was isolated for 251 (53.4% [95% CI 48.8%;58.0%]): 47.1% of infants and toddlers, 68.3% older children (p<0.001). Among children with isolated bacterial otopathogens (n = 219), non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) was the most frequent otopathogen isolated (n = 106, 48.4% [95% CI 41.6%;55.2%]), followed by Streptoccocus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]) (n = 76, 34.7% [95% CI 28.4%;41.4%]) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) (n = 61, 27.9% [95% Ci 22.0%;34.3%]). NTHi was frequently isolated in infants and toddlers (53.1%), whereas the main otopathogen in older children was GAS (52.3%). In cases of co-infection with at least two otopathogens (16.9%, n = 37/219), NTHi was frequently involved (78.4%, n = 29/37). When Sp was isolated, PCV13 serotypes accounted for 32.1% of cases, with serotype 3 the main serotype (16.1%). Among Sp strains, 29.5% were penicillin-intermediate and among NTHi strains, 16.0% were β-lactamase-producers. More than 5 years after PCV13 implementation, the leading bacterial species recovered from AOM with SPTM was NTHi for infants and toddlers and GAS for older children. In both age groups, Sp was the third most frequent pathogen and vaccine serotypes still played an important role. No resistant Sp strains were isolated, and the frequency of β-lactamase-producing NTHi did not exceed 16%."
https://openalex.org/W2912371553,"Energy expenditure (EE) calculated from respirometric indirect calorimetry is most accurate when based on oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and estimated protein metabolism (PM). EE has a substantial dependence of ~7% on the respiratory quotient (RQ, VCO2/VO2) and a lesser dependence on PM, yet many studies have instead estimated EE from VO2 only while PM has often been ignored, thus reducing accuracy. In 1949 Weir proposed a method to accurately calculate EE without using RQ, which also adjusts for estimated PM based on dietary composition. This RQ- method utilizes the calorimeter airflow rate (FR), the change in fractional O2 concentration (ΔFO2) and the dietary protein fraction. The RQ- method has not previously been empirically validated against the standard RQ+ method using both VO2 and RQ. Our aim was to do that.VO2 and VCO2 were measured repeatedly in 8 mice fed a high protein diet (HPD) during exposure to different temperatures (n = 168 measurements of 24h gas exchange). The HPD-adjusted RQ+ equation was: EE [kcal/time] = VO2 [L/time]×(3.853+1.081RQ) while the corresponding RQ- equation was: EE = 4.934×FR×ΔFO2. Agreement was analyzed using the ratios of the RQ- to RQ+ methods along with regression and Bland-Altman agreement analyses. We also evaluated the standard equation using the dietary food quotient (FQ) of 0.91 as a proxy for RQ (FQ+ method).Ratio analysis revealed that the mean error of the RQ- method was only 0.11 ± 0.042% while the maximum error was only 0.21%. Error using the FQ+ method was 4 -and 10-fold greater, respectively. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the RQ- method very slightly overestimates EE as RQ decreases. Theoretically, this error can be eliminated completely by imposing an incurrent fractional oxygen concentration at a value only slightly greater than the atmospheric level.The Weir 'RQ-free' method for calculating EE is a highly valid alternative to the 'gold standard' method that requires RQ. The RQ- approach permits reduced cost and complexity in studies focused on EE and provides a way to rescue EE measurement in studies compromised by faulty CO2 measurements. Practitioners of respirometry should consider adjusting EE calculations for estimated protein metabolism based on dietary composition."

We studied the imprinting status in selected imprints (H19, IGF2, SNRPN, PEG3, MEST1, NESPAS, KvDMR, IG-DMR and ZAC1) by pyrosequencing in blood samples from longitudinal cohorts born in 1936 (n = 485) and 1921 (n = 223), and anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus, periventricular white matter, and thalamus from brains donated to the Aberdeen Brain Bank (n = 4). MEST1 imprint methylation was related to childhood cognitive ability score (-0.416 95% CI -0.792,-0.041; p = 0.030), with the strongest effect evident in males (-0.929 95% CI -1.531,-0.326; p = 0.003). SNRPN imprint methylation was also related to childhood cognitive ability (+0.335 95%CI 0.008,0.663; p = 0.045). A significant association was also observed for SNRPN methylation and adult crystallised cognitive ability (+0.262 95%CI 0.007,0.517; p = 0.044). Further testing of significant findings in a second cohort from the same region, but born in 1921, resulted in similar effect sizes and greater significance when the cohorts were combined (MEST1; -0.371 95% CI -0.677,-0.065; p = 0.017; SNRPN; +0.361 95% CI 0.079,0.643; p = 0.012). For SNRPN and MEST1 and four other imprints the methylation levels in blood and in the five brain regions were similar. Methylation of the paternally expressed, maternally methylated genes SNRPN and MEST1 in adult blood was associated with cognitive ability in childhood. This is consistent with the known importance of the SNRPN containing 15q11-q13 and the MEST1 containing 7q31-34 regions in cognitive function. These findings, and their sex specific nature in MEST1, point to new mechanisms through which complex phenotypes such as cognitive ability may be inherited. These mechanisms are potentially relevant to both the heritable and non-heritable components of cognitive ability. The process of epigenetic imprinting—within SNRPN and MEST1 in particular—and the factors that influence it, are worthy of further study in relation to the determinants of cognitive ability."
https://openalex.org/W2913519258,"We previously reported that iron down-regulates transcription of the leptin gene by increasing occupancy of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) at two sites in the leptin gene promoter. Several nutrient-sensing pathways including O-GlcNAcylation also regulate leptin. We therefore investigated whether O-glycosylation plays a role in iron- and CREB-mediated regulation of leptin. We found that high iron decreases protein O-GlcNAcylation both in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and in mice fed high-iron diets and down-regulates leptin mRNA and protein levels. Glucosamine treatment, which bypasses the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of substrate for glycosylation, increased both O-GlcNAc and leptin, whereas inhibition of O-glycosyltransferase (OGT) decreased O-GlcNAc and leptin. The increased leptin levels induced by glucosamine were susceptible to the inhibition by iron, but in the case of OGT inhibition, iron did not further decrease leptin. Mice with deletion of the O-GlcNAcase gene, either via whole-body heterozygous deletion or through adipocyte-targeted homozygous deletion, exhibited increased O-GlcNAc levels in adipose tissue and increased leptin levels that were inhibited by iron. Of note, iron increased the occupancy of pCREB and decreased the occupancy of O-GlcNAcylated CREB on the leptin promoter. These patterns observed in our experimental models suggest that iron exerts its effects on leptin by decreasing O-glycosylation and not by increasing protein deglycosylation and that neither O-GlcNAcase nor OGT mRNA and protein levels are affected by iron. We conclude that iron down-regulates leptin by decreasing CREB glycosylation, resulting in increased CREB phosphorylation and leptin promoter occupancy by pCREB."

In addition to glucose, insulin has been shown to increase HIF1α protein levels (9Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Semenza G.L. Van Obberghen E.

Also, it is well appreciated that insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance are key factors in the development of type 2 diabetes, and both are commonly seen in elderly populations. For example, the postprandial glucose excursion is substantially greater and remains elevated longer in nondiabetic elderly adults than in nondiabetic younger adults (10Short K.R. Bigelow M.L.

Furthermore, aging is associated with body composition changes including excess fat mass (11He X. Li Z. Tang X. Zhang L. Wang L. He Y. Jin T. Yuan D. Age- and sex-related differences in body composition in healthy subjects aged 18 to 82 years.Medicine (Baltimore). 2018; 97 (29924020)e1115210.1097/MD.0000000000011152Google Scholar). However, it is unclear if metabolic disorders in advanced age are mediated through similar or different mechanisms compared with the dietary etiologies of diabetes such as chronic high-calorie feeding. Recently, hypothalamic dysfunction has been implicated in the development of not only dietary metabolic syndromes (12Zhang X. Zhang G. Zhang H. Karin M. Bai H. Cai D.

Insulin signaling in the hypothalamus is important in metabolic regulation (17Coll A.P. Yeo G.S. The hypothalamus and metabolism: integrating signals to control energy and glucose homeostasis.Curr.

In this context, this study investigates whether hypothalamic HIF2α responds to insulin and how this reaction is affected under different age and dietary conditions. Also, because HIF can induce Pomc gene transcription (8Zhang H. Zhang G. Gonzalez F.J. Park S.M. Cai D. Hypoxia-inducible factor directs POMC gene to mediate hypothalamic glucose sensing and energy balance regulation.Plos Biol. 2011; 9 (21814490)e100111210.1371/journal.pbio.1001112Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we further study if HIF2α contributes to insulin-dependent Pomc gene expression, and how loss of HIF2α in Pomc neurons affects metabolic physiology at different ages. Although glucose infusion has been shown to increase HIF2α protein levels (8Zhang H. Zhang G. Gonzalez F.J. Park S.M. Cai D. Hypoxia-inducible factor directs POMC gene to mediate hypothalamic glucose sensing and energy balance regulation.Plos Biol. 2011; 9 (21814490)e100111210.1371/journal.pbio.1001112Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether insulin influences hypothalamic HIF2α, despite evidence that HIF1α mRNA and protein were shown to increase after insulin stimulation in human retinal epithelial cells (9Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Semenza G.L. Van Obberghen E. Insulin stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/target of rapamycin-dependent signaling pathway.J.

To investigate the effect of insulin on hypothalamic HIF2α, we assessed if HIF2α expression in the hypothalamus is altered after hypothalamic third ventricle insulin injection in chow-fed 3-month-old mice. We found hypothalamic HIF2α protein levels increased dramatically and rapidly post-insulin injection (Fig. 1, A and B). Chow-fed 15-month-old mice were comparatively studied, showing that up-regulation of hypothalamic HIF2α protein by insulin was substantially attenuated (Fig. 1, A and B). Apart from the aged mice, we also included a group of 3-month-old mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks, which was enough time to cause body weight gain. Despite the young age of these animals, HFD feeding greatly diminished the ability of insulin to up-regulate the hypothalamic HIF2α protein, to a similar degree as seen in advanced age (Fig. 1, A and B). Because the IR/IRS-2/AKT/FOXO1 cascade in insulin signaling is known to be inactive in diet-induced obesity (DIO) conditions (18Ropelle E.R. Pauli J.R. Prada P. Cintra D.E. Rocha G.Z. Moraes J.C. Frederico M.J. da Luz G. Pinho R.A. Carvalheira J.B.C. Velloso L.A. Saad M.A. De Souza C.T. Inhibition of hypothalamic Foxo1 expression reduced food intake in diet-induced obesity rats.J. Physiol.

We found that insulin injection increased activation of this pathway, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of IRS-1, IRS-2, AKT (Ser-473), and FOXO1 in young mice. However, insulin-stimulated activation of this pathway was blunted in HFD-fed mice compared with age-matched chow-fed mice (Fig. 1, A and C–F). Interestingly, phosphorylation of these proteins was similar in 3-month-old and 15-month-old chow-fed mice (Fig. 1, A and C–F). Thus, we identified a time window in middle-aged mice in which the core components of insulin signaling are still not affected, given the evidence that this pathway is inhibited in older mice (19Sartorius T. Peter A. Heni M. Maetzler W. Fritsche A. Häring H.U. Hennige A.M. The brain response to peripheral insulin declines with age: a contribution of the blood-brain barrier?.Plos One. 2015; 10 (25965336)e012680410.1371/journal.pone.0126804Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, impairment in insulin-dependent HIF2α induction in the hypothalamus is a common change in advanced age and HFD feeding, unlike the IR/IRS-2/AKT/FOXO1 core pathway activation in response to insulin, which differs between these two etiological conditions. We then examined whether middle age could affect insulin-induced regulation of Pomc gene expression in the hypothalamus. For comparison, we analyzed gene expression of neuropeptides neuropeptide Y (Npy) and agouti-related transcript (Agrp), because they are produced by AgRP neurons, which are located in the same hypothalamic subregion as POMC neurons but are known to functionally oppose them (20Dietrich M.O. Horvath T.L. Hypothalamic control of energy balance: insights into the role of synaptic plasticity.Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36 (23318157): 65-7310.1016/j.tins.2012.12.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A less relevant neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) was further included in the assay as an additional reference. Indeed, central injection of insulin led to a great increase in hypothalamic Pomc mRNA levels as compared with vehicle injection in 3-month-old chow-fed mice. In contrast, this effect of insulin dropped substantially in 15-month-old chow-fed mice, although the remaining effect was still statistically significant (Fig. 2A). Insulin-induced hypothalamic Pomc gene expression was more strongly inhibited in HFD-fed mice, which was statistically nonsignificant compared with young controls (Fig. 2A). We did not observe any obvious differences in Pomc mRNA levels between 3-month-old chow-fed, 3-month-old HFD, and 15-month-old chow-fed mice with vehicle injection. On the other hand, insulin did not significantly affect the expression levels of other neuropeptides at this time point (Fig. 2A). These results agree with previous work showing that hypothalamic insulin injection did not acutely affect Agrp and Npy gene expression (21Brown L.M. Clegg D.J. Benoit S.C. Woods S.C. Intraventricular insulin and leptin reduce food intake and body weight in C57BL/6J mice.Physiol.

Hence, whereas hypothalamic POMC is a neuropeptide that is sensitive to insulin, this sensitivity dramatically declines in both conditions of DIO and middle age. Considering that these two conditions have different influences on the IR/IRS-2/Akt/FOXO1 signaling cascade, it prompted us to question if HIF could be particularly important for the effect of aging on POMC. To experimentally address the question raised above, we investigated whether loss of HIF2α in POMC neurons could affect insulin signaling and further regulate hypothalamic Pomc gene transcription. To do so, we ablated HIF2α in hypothalamic Pomc neurons by crossing POMC-Cre mice with HIF2αlox/lox mice, leading to compound offspring termed POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect HIF2α in POMC neurons of this knockout mouse model compared with littermate controls. As shown in Fig. 3, A–C, HIF2α protein was present in the majority of POMC neurons in control mice but not detectable in the majority of POMC neurons in POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice. It is also worth mentioning that HIF2α ablation did not reduce the number of hypothalamic POMC neurons, and consistent with this profile, HIF2α knockout mice were metabolically indistinguishable from littermate controls when young. To profile insulin-induced hypothalamic Pomc expression, knockout mice and controls received a single infusion of insulin through a cannula implanted in the hypothalamic third ventricle. As shown in Fig. 3, D and E, insulin increased hypothalamic Pomc mRNA in chow-fed controls at a young age but did less so in chow-fed controls of middle age. Relatively, HIF2α knockout in POMC neurons blunted insulin’s ability to increase Pomc mRNA more so in middle-aged mice than young mice (Fig. 3, D and E), suggesting that loss of HIF2α might affect additional age-dependent pathway(s), which can stimulate Pomc gene expression. Under HFD conditions, insulin’s ability to increase Pomc mRNA was abolished similarly in control and POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice (Fig. 3F), indicating that HFD feeding and HIF2α loss might share an overlapping mechanism to inhibit Pomc gene expression. Thus, HIF2α is an appreciable factor contributing to insulin-induced Pomc gene expression, which is sensitive to age and dietary conditions. Using physiological approaches, we further examined whether HIF2α knockout in POMC neurons could compromise the feeding regulation of hypothalamic insulin. This study was based on the experimental condition that prolonged fasting (24 h) induces a feeding response that is inhibited by hypothalamic insulin administration. Indeed, insulin was able to suppress food intake by 55–60% in chow-fed control young mice and middle-aged mice (Fig. 4, A–D). In contrast, this inhibitory effect of insulin was blunted in POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice, as evidenced by insulin suppressing food intake by 28% in young mice and 16% in middle-aged mice, compared with their respective controls (Fig. 4, A–D). These data may also implicate that certain factors during middle age can work to potentiate the metabolic consequences of HIF2α loss. In HFD-fed mice, insulin barely inhibited food intake in control and POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice even when young (Fig. 4, E and F). Thus, feeding dysregulation under HFD feeding is strong enough to mask the metabolic effects of HIF2α loss. Altogether, impairment of HIF2α in POMC neurons is sufficient to reduce insulin sensitivity in the regulation of feeding. To completely profile the metabolic outcomes of POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice, we set up a group of these animals for longitudinal follow-up of body weight and feeding, compared with the littermate HIF2αlox/lox controls and age-matched POMC-Cre controls. To single out the metabolic effects of HIF2α inactivation, the experiment was performed using standard normal chow feeding. As shown in Fig. 5A, these three groups of mice were similar in terms of weight gain until middle age. Roughly starting ∼6 months of age, POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice showed a gradual increase in body weight compared with both controls (Fig. 5A). At around 8–12 months old, weight gain levels in the knockout mice was quite apparent. Magnetic resonance imaging scanning was performed for these mice 3 times during the experimental follow-up, showing that the excess weight gain in knockout mice was attributed to fat mass instead of lean mass (Fig. 5, B and C). Food intake profiling revealed that knockout mice were often hyperphagic; although modest when young, it became increasingly obvious with advanced age (Fig. 5D). Water intake was similar between POMC/HIF2αlox/lox and control mice during the follow-up. We also subjected subgroups of POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice and the littermate HIF2αlox/lox controls to metabolic cages to measure oxygen consumption levels. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, knockout mice had reduced oxygen consumption during the day and night, despite no significant difference in locomotive activities (Fig. 5G). Thus, apart from food intake, reduced energy expenditure is likely another contributor to the body weight phenotype of these knockout mice. Taken together, HIF2α loss in POMC neurons can mimic the effect of advanced age leading to excess weight and body fat. Impaired glucose tolerance is characteristic of a pre-diabetic state as well as aging. Therefore, to determine whether HIF2α knockout in POMC neurons plays a role in the development of glucose intolerance, we performed glucose tolerance tests (GTT) in 3-month-old versus 12-month-old POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice, compared with age-matched controls. These mice were all maintained on a chow diet as described above. We observed that POMC/HIF2αlox/lox mice had normal glucose tolerance at 3 months, but by 12 months old, they displayed a mild to moderate degree of glucose intolerance when compared with either HIF2αlox/lox controls or POMC-Cre controls (Fig. 6, A–D). Because insulin resistance is an important factor for the development of glucose intolerance, we further examined insulin tolerance in these mice. In agreement with glucose intolerance, knockout mice showed a normal level of glucose responsiveness to insulin when young, but this response was diminished in 12-month-old mice (Fig. 6, E–H). Although the magnitudes of glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity were not dramatic, these changes agreed with the moderate overweight phenotype in these mice at these ages. To summarize, loss of HIF2α in POMC neurons leads to weight increase and glucose disorders in an age-dependent manner. These findings support the hypothesis that reduction of HIF2α in the hypothalamus has a mechanistic contribution to the development and progression of age-related metabolic disorders. Previous research has studied insulin signaling in the hypothalamus and the central nervous system. Although deletion of IRs in POMC neurons has minimal impact on body weight and blood glucose (23Hill J.W. Elias C.F. Fukuda M. Williams K.W. Berglund E.D. Holland W.L. Cho Y.R. Chuang J.C. Xu Y.

However, the relationship between hypothalamic insulin signaling and HIF has not been studied thus far, although insulin was shown to activate HIF1α in certain peripheral cells such as retinal epithelial cells (9Treins C.

In this study, we found that central insulin injection greatly increases hypothalamic HIF2α protein. This effect of central insulin is rapid, suggesting that HIF2α might contribute to the transcriptional program of hypothalamic insulin signaling. In research, hypothalamic insulin resistance has been implicated in obesity. For example, activation of hypothalamic IR/IRS-2/AKT/FOXO1 by insulin is impaired in DIO animals (18Ropelle E.R. Pauli J.R. Prada P. Cintra D.E. Rocha G.Z. Moraes J.C. Frederico M.J. da Luz G. Pinho R.A. Carvalheira J.B.C. Velloso L.A. Saad M.A. De Souza C.T.

Compared with DIO, which is substantive for diabetic development, little is known for the condition of age advancement. Although previous research has shown that insulin-stimulated hypothalamic IR, GSK3, AKT, and p70S6K phosphorylation decreased in older than 2-year aged rats (28Garcia-San Frutos M. Fernández-Agulló T. De Solís A.J. Andrés A. Arribas C. Carrascosa J.M. Ros M. Impaired central insulin response in aged Wistar rats: role of adiposity.Endocrinology. 2007; 148 (17673515): 5238-524710.1210/en.2007-0543Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it is entirely unclear how hypothalamic signaling is changed at middle age (for example, at 12–15 months), representing a time window that may set up the mechanisms for aging pathology. We evaluated middle-aged mice in this study and found that IR/IRS-2/AKT/FOXO1 pathway activation in these mice is comparable with young mice. In contrast, insulin-induced hypothalamic HIF2α up-regulation dramatically dropped in these middle-aged mice. This drop at advanced age is comparable with the change seen in short-term DIO. Thus, hypothalamic HIF2α up-regulation by insulin is impaired in both DIO and advanced age. Compared with hypothalamic IR/IRS-2/AKT/FOXO1 in insulin response, HIF2α is selectively affected at middle age, indicating that this HIF2α decline might be highly sensitive and essential for the initiation of metabolic disorders during the progression of aging. Hypothalamic POMC neurons are fundamentally important for the central regulation of feeding and metabolic homeostasis via the secretion of several bioactive neuropeptides that are cleaved from the POMC precursor (29Mercer A.J.

The purpose of the study was to compare survival rates between exercise-related OHCA at sports arenas versus outside of sports arenas.Data from all treated exercise-related OHCA outside home reported to the Swedish Register of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (SRCR) from 2011 to 2014 in 10 counties of Sweden was analyzed (population 6 million). The registry has in those counties a coverage of almost 100% of all OHCAs.3714 cases of OHCA outside of home were found. Amongst them, 268(7%) were exercise-related and 164 (61.2%) of those occurred at sports arenas. The 30-day survival rate was higher for exercise-related OHCA at sports arenas compared to outside (55.7% vs 30.0%, p<0.0001). OHCA-victims at sports arenas were younger (mean age±SD 57.6±16.3 years compared to 60.9±17.0 years, p = 0.05), less likely female (4.3% vs 12.2%, p = 0.02) and had a higher frequency of shockable rhythm (73.0% vs 54.3%, p = 0.004). OHCAs at arenas were more often witnessed (83.9% vs 68.9%, p = 0.007), received bystander CPR to a higher extent (90.0% vs 56.8%, p<0.0001) and the AED-use before EMS-arrival was also higher in this group (29.8% vs 11.1%, p = 0.009).The prognosis is markedly better for exercise-related OHCA occurring at sports arenas compared to outside. Victims of exercise-related OHCA at sports arenas are more likely to receive bystander CPR and to be connected to a public AED. These findings support an increased use of public AEDs and implementation of Medical Action Plans (MAP), to possibly increase survival of exercise-related OHCA even further."
https://openalex.org/W2912118839,"The novel type, fungus specific protein phosphatase Z1 of the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans (CaPpz1) has several important physiological roles. It consists of a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain and a variable, intrinsically disordered, N-terminal regulatory domain. To test the function of these domains we modified the structure of CaPpz1 by in vitro mutagenesis. The two main domains were separated, four potential protein binding regions were deleted, and the myristoylation site as well as the active site of the enzyme was crippled by point mutations G2A and R262L, respectively. The in vitro phosphatase activity assay of the bacterially expressed recombinant proteins indicated that the N-terminal domain was inactive, while the C-terminal domain became highly active against myosin light chain substrate. The deletion of the N-terminal 1-16 amino acids and the G2A mutation significantly decreased the specific activity of the enzyme. Complementation of the ppz1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutant strain with the different CaPpz1 forms demonstrated that the scission of the main domains, the two point mutations and the N-terminal 1-16 deletion rendered the phosphatase incompetent in the in vivo assays of LiCl tolerance and caffeine sensitivity.

Characterization of the purified recombinant P-domain with SEC revealed that it formed dimers, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis demonstrated that the hydrodynamic diameter of the dimers was ~6 nm. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed that the P-domain contained 67.9% of beta-sheets, but without alpha-helical structures. This is in good agreement with the cryo-electron microscopic analysis of MrNV which demonstrated that the P-domain contains only beta-stranded structures. Our findings of this study provide essential information for the production of the P-domain of MrNV-CP that will aid future studies particularly studies that will shed light on anti-viral drug discovery and provide an understanding of virus-host interactions and the viral pathogenicity."

We hypothesized that myocardial ischemia from cardiac stress testing will produce dynamic changes in acylcarnitine and amino acid levels compared to levels seen in matched control patients with normal stress tests. Methods We analyzed targeted metabolomic profiles in a pilot study of 20 case patients with inducible ischemia on stress testing from an existing prospectively collected repository of 357 consecutive patients presenting with symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) in an Emergency Department (ED) observation unit between November 2012 and September 2014. We selected 20 controls matched on age, sex, and body-mass index (BMI). A peripheral blood sample was drawn <1 hour before stress testing and 2 hours after stress testing on each patient. We assayed 60 select acylcarnitines and amino acids by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a Quattro Micro instrument (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA). Metabolite values were log transformed for skew. We then performed bivariable analysis for stress test outcome and both individual timepoint metabolite concentrations and stress-delta metabolite ratios (T2/T0). False discovery rates (FDR) were calculated for 60 metabolites while controlling for age, sex, and BMI. We built multivariable regularized linear models to predict stress test outcome from metabolomics data at times 0, 2 hours, and log ratio between these two. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate the performance characteristics of the model. Results Nine of our 20 case subjects were male. Cases’ average age was 55.8, with an average BMI 29.5. Bivariable analysis identified 5 metabolites associated with positive stress tests (FDR < 0.2): alanine, C14:1-OH, C16:1, C18:2, C20:4. The multivariable regularized linear models built on T0 and T2 had Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) between 0.5 and 0.55, however, the log(T2/T0) model yielded 0.625 AUC, with 65% sensitivity and 60% specificity. The top metabolites selected by the model were: Ala, Arg, C12-OH/C10-DC, C14:1-OH, C16:1, C18:2, C18:1, C20:4 and C18:1-DC. Conclusions Stress-delta metabolite analysis of patients undergoing stress testing is feasible. Future studies with a larger sample size are warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2913489241,"Despite the recent increase in economic evaluations of health care programs in low and middle income countries, there is still a surprising gap in evidence on the appropriate discount rate and the discounting of health outcomes such as quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Our study aimed to calculate the implied time preference rate for health outcomes in Iran and its key determinants. Data were gathered from one family member from each of the 650 households randomly selected in Tehran. The respondents' private and social preferences for health outcomes were calculated using the time trade-off (TTO) technique based on the discounted utility model. We investigated the main assumptions of the discounted utility model through equality of mean comparison, and the association between private time preference and key socio-economic determinants using multilevel regression analysis. The mean and median implied rates were 5.8% and 4.9% for private time preference and 25.6% and 20% for social time preference respectively. Our study confirmed that magnitude, framing and time effects have a significant impact on implied discount rates, which means that the conventional discounted utility model's main assumptions are violated in the Iranian general population. Other models of discounting which apply lower rates for far health outcomes might provide a more sensible solution to discounting health interventions with long-term impacts."
https://openalex.org/W2912182230,"Neuroimaging for headaches is both common and costly. While the costs are well quantified, little is known about the benefit in terms of diagnosing pathology. Our objective was to determine the role of early neuroimaging in the identification of malignant brain tumors in individuals presenting to healthcare providers with headaches.This was a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data (2001-2014) from a US insurer. Individuals were included if they had an outpatient visit for headaches and excluded for prior headache visits, other neurologic conditions, neuroimaging within the previous year, and cancer. The exposure was early neuroimaging, defined as neuroimaging within 30 days of the first headache visit. A propensity score-matched group that did not undergo early neuroimaging was then created. The primary outcome was frequency of malignant brain tumor diagnoses and median time to diagnosis within the first year after the incident headache visit. The secondary outcome was frequency of incidental findings.22.2% of 180,623 individuals had early neuroimaging. In the following year, malignant brain tumors were found in 0.28% (0.23-0.34%) of the early neuroimaging group and 0.04% (0.02-0.06%) of the referent group (P<0.001). Median time to diagnosis in the early neuroimaging group was 8 (3-19) days versus 72 (39-189) days for the referent group (P<0.001). Likely incidental findings were discovered in 3.17% (3.00-3.34%) of the early neuroimaging group and 0.66% (0.58-0.74%) of the referent group (P<0.001).Malignant brain tumors in individuals presenting with an incident headache diagnosis are rare and early neuroimaging leads to a small reduction in the time to diagnosis."

For the first time, the acceleration in Aβ42 aggregation induced by the Arctic mutation was monitored in cells, revealing a number of distinct morphologies that form sequentially. This approach will help discriminate the impacts of mutations on amyloid protein processing, Aβ aggregation propensity, and other mechanistic outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2913948539,"The unexpected early cessation of the recent West Africa Ebola outbreak demonstrated shortcomings of popular forecasting approaches and has not been fully understood yet. A popular hypothesis is that public health interventions mitigated the spread, such as ETUs and safe burials. We investigate whether risk heterogeneity within the population could serve as an alternative explanation. We introduce a model for spread in heterogeneous host population that is particularly well suited for early predictions due to its simplicity and ease of application. Furthermore, we explore the conditions under which the observed epidemic trajectory can be explained without taking into account the effect of public health interventions. While the obtained fits closely match the total case count time series, closer inspection of sub-population results made us conclude that risk heterogeneity is unlikely to fully explain the early cessation of Ebola; other factors such as behavioral changes and other interventions likely played a major role. More accurate predictions in a future scenario require models that allow for early sub-exponential growth, as well as access to additional data on patient occupation (risk level) and location, to allow identify local phenomena that influence spreading behavior."
