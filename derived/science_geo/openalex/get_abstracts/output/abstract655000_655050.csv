https://openalex.org/W3038072559,"Most patients with rare diseases do not receive a molecular diagnosis and the aetiological variants and causative genes for more than half such disorders remain to be discovered1. Here we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a national health system to streamline diagnosis and to discover unknown aetiological variants in the coding and non-coding regions of the genome. We generated WGS data for 13,037 participants, of whom 9,802 had a rare disease, and provided a genetic diagnosis to 1,138 of the 7,065 extensively phenotyped participants. We identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare diseases, of which 11 have been discovered since 2015 and at least 79 are confirmed to be aetiological. By generating WGS data of UK Biobank participants2, we found that rare alleles can explain the presence of some individuals in the tails of a quantitative trait for red blood cells. Finally, we identified four novel non-coding variants that cause disease through the disruption of transcription of ARPC1B, GATA1, LRBA and MPL. Our study demonstrates a synergy by using WGS for diagnosis and aetiological discovery in routine healthcare. Whole-genome sequencing and phenotype data sharing are introduced in a national health system to streamline diagnosis and to discover coding and non-coding variants that cause rare diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3037521146,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra1. Similar to other major neurodegenerative disorders, there are no disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's disease. While most treatment strategies aim to prevent neuronal loss or protect vulnerable neuronal circuits, a potential alternative is to replace lost neurons to reconstruct disrupted circuits2. Here we report an efficient one-step conversion of isolated mouse and human astrocytes to functional neurons by depleting the RNA-binding protein PTB (also known as PTBP1). Applying this approach to the mouse brain, we demonstrate progressive conversion of astrocytes to new neurons that innervate into and repopulate endogenous neural circuits. Astrocytes from different brain regions are converted to different neuronal subtypes. Using a chemically induced model of Parkinson's disease in mouse, we show conversion of midbrain astrocytes to dopaminergic neurons, which provide axons to reconstruct the nigrostriatal circuit. Notably, re-innervation of striatum is accompanied by restoration of dopamine levels and rescue of motor deficits. A similar reversal of disease phenotype is also accomplished by converting astrocytes to neurons using antisense oligonucleotides to transiently suppress PTB. These findings identify a potentially powerful and clinically feasible approach to treating neurodegeneration by replacing lost neurons."

https://openalex.org/W3037237156,"Decrease in processing speed due to increased resistance and capacitance delay is a major obstacle for the down-scaling of electronics1–3. Minimizing the dimensions of interconnects (metal wires that connect different electronic components on a chip) is crucial for the miniaturization of devices. Interconnects are isolated from each other by non-conducting (dielectric) layers. So far, research has mostly focused on decreasing the resistance of scaled interconnects because integration of dielectrics using low-temperature deposition processes compatible with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductors is technically challenging. Interconnect isolation materials must have low relative dielectric constants (κ values), serve as diffusion barriers against the migration of metal into semiconductors, and be thermally, chemically and mechanically stable. Specifically, the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems recommends4 the development of dielectrics with κ values of less than 2 by 2028. Existing low-κ materials (such as silicon oxide derivatives, organic compounds and aerogels) have κ values greater than 2 and poor thermo-mechanical properties5. Here we report three-nanometre-thick amorphous boron nitride films with ultralow κ values of 1.78 and 1.16 (close to that of air, κ = 1) at operation frequencies of 100 kilohertz and 1 megahertz, respectively. The films are mechanically and electrically robust, with a breakdown strength of 7.3 megavolts per centimetre, which exceeds requirements. Cross-sectional imaging reveals that amorphous boron nitride prevents the diffusion of cobalt atoms into silicon under very harsh conditions, in contrast to reference barriers. Our results demonstrate that amorphous boron nitride has excellent low-κ dielectric characteristics for high-performance electronics. Thin films of amorphous boron nitride are mechanically and electrically robust, prevent diffusion of metal atoms into semiconductors and have ultralow dielectric constants that exceed current recommendations for high-performance electronics."
https://openalex.org/W3025781942,"Eukaryotic cells migrate by coupling the intracellular force of the actin cytoskeleton to the environment. While force coupling is usually mediated by transmembrane adhesion receptors, especially those of the integrin family, amoeboid cells such as leukocytes can migrate extremely fast despite very low adhesive forces1. Here we show that leukocytes cannot only migrate under low adhesion but can also transmit forces in the complete absence of transmembrane force coupling. When confined within three-dimensional environments, they use the topographical features of the substrate to propel themselves. Here the retrograde flow of the actin cytoskeleton follows the texture of the substrate, creating retrograde shear forces that are sufficient to drive the cell body forwards. Notably, adhesion-dependent and adhesion-independent migration are not mutually exclusive, but rather are variants of the same principle of coupling retrograde actin flow to the environment and thus can potentially operate interchangeably and simultaneously. As adhesion-free migration is independent of the chemical composition of the environment, it renders cells completely autonomous in their locomotive behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W3037260227,"Clonally expanded blood cells that contain somatic mutations (clonal haematopoiesis) are commonly acquired with age and increase the risk of blood cancer1-9. The blood clones identified so far contain diverse large-scale mosaic chromosomal alterations (deletions, duplications and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH)) on all chromosomes1,2,5,6,9, but the sources of selective advantage that drive the expansion of most clones remain unknown. Here, to identify genes, mutations and biological processes that give selective advantage to mutant clones, we analysed genotyping data from the blood-derived DNA of 482,789 participants from the UK Biobank10. We identified 19,632 autosomal mosaic chromosomal alterations and analysed these for relationships to inherited genetic variation. We found 52 inherited, rare, large-effect coding or splice variants in 7 genes that were associated with greatly increased vulnerability to clonal haematopoiesis with specific acquired CN-LOH mutations. Acquired mutations systematically replaced the inherited risk alleles (at MPL) or duplicated them to the homologous chromosome (at FH, NBN, MRE11, ATM, SH2B3 and TM2D3). Three of the genes (MRE11, NBN and ATM) encode components of the MRN-ATM pathway, which limits cell division after DNA damage and telomere attrition11-13; another two (MPL and SH2B3) encode proteins that regulate the self-renewal of stem cells14-16. In addition, we found that CN-LOH mutations across the genome tended to cause chromosomal segments with alleles that promote the expansion of haematopoietic cells to replace their homologous (allelic) counterparts, increasing polygenic drive for blood-cell proliferation traits. Readily acquired mutations that replace chromosomal segments with their homologous counterparts seem to interact with pervasive inherited variation to create a challenge for lifelong cytopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W3037174006,"Oceanic lithosphere carries volatiles, notably water, into the mantle through subduction at convergent plate boundaries. This subducted water exercises control on the production of magma, earthquakes, formation of continental crust and mineral resources. Identifying different potential fluid sources (sediments, crust and mantle lithosphere) and tracing fluids from their release to the surface has proved challenging1. Atlantic subduction zones are a valuable endmember when studying this deep water cycle because hydration in Atlantic lithosphere, produced by slow spreading, is expected to be highly non-uniform2. Here, as part of a multi-disciplinary project in the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc3, we studied boron trace element and isotopic fingerprints of melt inclusions. These reveal that serpentine—that is, hydrated mantle rather than crust or sediments—is a dominant supplier of subducted water to the central arc. This serpentine is most likely to reside in a set of major fracture zones subducted beneath the central arc over approximately the past ten million years. The current dehydration of these fracture zones coincides with the current locations of the highest rates of earthquakes and prominent low shear velocities, whereas the preceding history of dehydration is consistent with the locations of higher volcanic productivity and thicker arc crust. These combined geochemical and geophysical data indicate that the structure and hydration of the subducted plate are directly connected to the evolution of the arc and its associated seismic and volcanic hazards. Serpentine subducted below the Lesser Antilles volcanic arc supplies water to the arc, controlling the location of seismicity, volcanic productivity and thickness of crust."
https://openalex.org/W3037441091,"The human GABAB receptor—a member of the class C family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)—mediates inhibitory neurotransmission and has been implicated in epilepsy, pain and addiction1. A unique GPCR that is known to require heterodimerization for function2–6, the GABAB receptor has two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, that are structurally homologous but perform distinct and complementary functions. GABAB1 recognizes orthosteric ligands7,8, while GABAB2 couples with G proteins9–14. Each subunit is characterized by an extracellular Venus flytrap (VFT) module, a descending peptide linker, a seven-helix transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail15. Although the VFT heterodimer structure has been resolved16, the structure of the full-length receptor and its transmembrane signalling mechanism remain unknown. Here we present a near full-length structure of the GABAB receptor, captured in an inactive state by cryo-electron microscopy. Our structure reveals several ligands that preassociate with the receptor, including two large endogenous phospholipids that are embedded within the transmembrane domains to maintain receptor integrity and modulate receptor function. We also identify a previously unknown heterodimer interface between transmembrane helices 3 and 5 of both subunits, which serves as a signature of the inactive conformation. A unique ‘intersubunit latch’ within this transmembrane interface maintains the inactive state, and its disruption leads to constitutive receptor activity. The structure of the GABAB receptor in an inactive state reveals, amongst other features, a latch between the two subunits that locks the transmembrane domain interface, and the presence of large phospholipids that may modulate receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W3037587471,"Fundamental studies of chemical reactions often consider the molecular dynamics along a reaction coordinate using a calculated or suggested potential energy surface1–5. But fully mapping such dynamics experimentally, by following all nuclear motions in a time-resolved manner—that is, the motions of wavepackets—is challenging and has not yet been realized even for the simple stereotypical bimolecular reaction6–8: A–B + C → A + B–C. Here we track the trajectories of these vibrational wavepackets during photoinduced bond formation of the gold trimer complex [Au(CN)2−]3 in an aqueous monomer solution, using femtosecond X-ray liquidography9–12 with X-ray free-electron lasers13,14. In the complex, which forms when three monomers A, B and C cluster together through non-covalent interactions15,16, the distance between A and B is shorter than that between B and C. Tracking the wavepacket in three-dimensional nuclear coordinates reveals that within the first 60 femtoseconds after photoexcitation, a covalent bond forms between A and B to give A–B + C. The second covalent bond, between B and C, subsequently forms within 360 femtoseconds to give a linear and covalently bonded trimer complex A–B–C. The trimer exhibits harmonic vibrations that we map and unambiguously assign to specific normal modes using only the experimental data. In principle, more intense X-rays could visualize the motion not only of highly scattering atoms such as gold but also of lighter atoms such as carbon and nitrogen, which will open the door to the direct tracking of the atomic motions involved in many chemical reactions. Femtosecond X-ray liquidography is used to track the vibrational wavepacket trajectories of gold atoms in solution, enabling time-resolved observations of the emergence of vibrations and the evolution of the formation of covalent bonds."
https://openalex.org/W3037883989,"In spite of efforts to increase gender diversity across many science fields, women continue to encounter beliefs that they lack ability and talent. Undergraduate education is a critical time when peer influence may alter choice of majors and careers for women interested in science. Even in life science courses, in which women outnumber men, gender biases that emerge in peer-to-peer interactions during coursework may detract from women's interest and progress. This is the first study of which we are aware to document that women are outperforming men in both physical and life science undergraduate courses at the same institution, while simultaneously continuing to be perceived as less-able students. This is problematic because undergraduate women may not be able to escape gender-ability stereotypes even when they are outperforming men, which has important implications for 1) the recognition of women's achievements among their peers in undergraduate education and 2) retention of women in STEM disciplines and careers."
https://openalex.org/W3037147034,"Soils contaminated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are an important source for impacting drinking water delivery systems and surface water bodies world-wide, posing an urgent risk to human health and environmental quality. However, few treatment techniques have been tested for PFAS-contaminated soil hotspots. This study investigated the possibility of thermal desorption as a possible technique to remediate soils contaminated with multiple PFASs. Two fortified soils (∑9PFAS ≈ 4 mg kg-1) and one field-contaminated soil (∑9PFAS ≈ 0.025 mg kg-1) were subjected to a 75-min thermal treatment at temperatures ranging from 150 to 550°C. Soil concentrations of PFASs showed a significant decrease at 350°C, with the ∑9PFAS concentration decreasing by, on average, 43% and 79% in the fortified and field contaminated soils, respectively. At 450°C, >99% of PFASs were removed from the fortified soils, while at 550°C the fraction removed ranged between 71 and 99% for the field contaminated soil. In the field contaminated soil, PFAS classes with functional groups of sulfonates (PFSAs) and sulfonamides (FOSAs) showed higher removal than the perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs). Thus thermal desorption has the potential to remove a wide variety of PFASs from soil, although more studies are needed to investigate the cost-effectiveness, creation of transformation products, and air-phase vacuum filtration techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3037097725,"Organic farmers, who rely on legumes as an external nitrogen (N) source, need a fast and easy on-the-go measurement technique to determine harvestable biomass and the amount of fixed N (NFix) for numerous farm management decisions. Especially clover- and lucerne-grass mixtures play an important role in the organic crop rotation under temperate European climate conditions. Multispectral sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are new promising tools for a non-destructive assessment of crop and grassland traits on large and remote areas. One disadvantage of multispectral information and derived vegetations indices is, that both ignore spatial relationships of pixels to each other in the image. This gap can be filled by texture features from a grey level co-occurrence matrix. The aim of this multi-temporal field study was to provide aboveground biomass and NFix estimation models for two legume-grass mixtures through a whole vegetation period based on UAV multispectral information. The prediction models covered different proportions of legumes (0–100% legumes) to represent the variable conditions in practical farming. Furthermore, the study compared prediction models with and without the inclusion of texture features. As multispectral data usually suffers from multicollinearity, two machine learning algorithms, Partial Least Square and Random Forest (RF) regression, were used. The results showed, that biomass prediction accuracy for the whole dataset as well as for crop-specific models were substantially improved by the inclusion of texture features. The best model was generated for the whole dataset by RF with an rRMSE of 10%. For NFix prediction accuracy of the best model was based on RF including texture (rRMSEP = 18%), which was not consistent with crop specific models."
https://openalex.org/W3037599311,"Cancers arise through the acquisition of oncogenic mutations and grow by clonal expansion1,2. Here we reveal that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved into a mutated DNA base pair within a single cell cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate, unrepaired, into daughter cells for multiple cell generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale phasing of subsequent mutations. We characterize this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show that DNA replication across persisting lesions can produce multiple alternative alleles in successive cell divisions, thereby generating both multiallelic and combinatorial genetic diversity. The phasing of lesions enables accurate measurement of strand-biased repair processes, quantification of oncogenic selection and fine mapping of sister-chromatid-exchange events. Finally, we demonstrate that lesion segregation is a unifying property of exogenous mutagens, including UV light and chemotherapy agents in human cells and tumours, which has profound implications for the evolution and adaptation of cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W3037335023,"Objective To investigate the co-occurrence of tinnitus-related distress and pain experiences alongside psychological factors that may underlie their association. Method Patients with chronic tinnitus (N = 1238) completed a questionnaire battery examining tinnitus-related distress and affective and sensory pain perceptions. A series of simple, parallel- and serial multiple mediator models examined indirect effects of psychological comorbidities as well as -process variables including depressivity, perceived stress and coping attitudes. Moderator and moderated mediation analyses examined differential relational patterns in patients with decompensated vs. compensated tinnitus. Results There were significant associations between tinnitus-related distress and pain perceptions. These were partially mediated by most specified variables. Psychological comorbidities appeared to influence tinnitus-pain associations through their impact on depressivity, perceived stress, and coping attitudes. Some specific differences in affective vs. sensory pain perception pathways emerged. Patients with decompensated tinnitus yielded significantly higher symptom burden across all measured indices. Tinnitus decompensation was associated with heightened associations between [1] tinnitus-related distress and pain perceptions, depressivity and negative coping attitudes; and [2] most psychological comorbidities and sensory, but not affective pain perception. Moderated mediation analyses revealed stronger indirect effects of depressivity and anxiety in mediating affective-, and anxiety in mediating sensory pain perception in patients with decompensated tinnitus. Conclusion Psychological constructs mediate the co-occurrence of tinnitus- and pain-related symptoms across different levels of tinnitus-related distress. Psychological treatment approaches should conceptualize and address individualised interactions of common cognitive-emotional processes in addressing psychosomatic symptom clusters across syndromatic patients with varying distress levels."
https://openalex.org/W3038077823,"Nanocomposites (NCs) of crosslinked polyaniline (CPA)-coated oxidized carbon nanomaterials (OXCNMs) were fabricated as a very sensitive and simple electrochemical sensor to be utilized in 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCPH) detection. CPA/OXCNMs NCs were prepared by chemical copolymerization of polyaniline with triphenylamine and p-phenylenediamine in the presence of OXCNMs. The CPA/GO-OXSWCNTNCs exhibited a higher affinity for the oxidation of chlorophenols compared to the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), CPA/GCE, and other NCs. Cyclic voltammetry was performed to investigate and assess the electrocatalytic oxidation of 2,4-DCPH on the modified GCE. The compound yielded a well-defined voltammetric response in a Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 5) at 0.54 V (vs. silver chloride electrode). Quantitative determination of 2,4-DCPH was performed by differential pulse voltammetry under optimal conditions in the concentration range of 0.05 to 1.2 nmol L-1, and a linear calibration graph was obtained. The detection limit (S/N = 3) was found to be 4.2 nmol L-1. In addition, the results demonstrated that the CPA/GO-OXSWCNTs/GCE sensor exhibited a strong anti-interference ability, reproducibility, and stability. The prepared CPA/GO-OXSWCNTs/GCE sensor was used to rapidly detect 2,4-DCPH with a high degree of sensitivity in fish farm water with proven levels of satisfactory recoveries."
https://openalex.org/W3037463809,"Introduction 3D printing is being used more extensively in modern biomedicine. One of the problems is selecting a proper crosslinking method of bioprinted material. Amongst currently used techniques we can distinguish: physical crosslinking (e.g. Ca2+ and Sr2+) and chemical crosslinking–the UV light crosslinking causing the biggest discussion. UV radiation is selectively absorbed by DNA, mainly in the UV-B region but also (to some extent) in UV-A and UV-C regions. DNA excitement results in typical photoproducts. The amount of strand breaks may vary depending on the period of exposition, it can also differ when cells undergo incubation after radiation. Aim The aim of this study was to show whether and how the time of irradiation with 405 nm and 365 nm wavelengths affect DNA damage in cell lines and micro-organs (pancreatic islets). Materials and methods The degree of DNA damage caused by different wavelengths of radiation (405 nm and 365 nm) was evaluated by a comet assay. The test was performed on fibroblasts, alpha cells, beta cells and porcine pancreatic islets after 24 hours incubation period. Samples without radiation treatment were selected as a control group. Results analysis consisted of determining the percent of cells with damaged DNA and the tail intensity evaluation. Results The degree of DNA damage in pancreatic islets after exposure to 405 nm wavelength oscillated between 2% and 6% depending on the tested time period (10 – 300 seconds). However, treating islets using 365 nm wavelength resulted in damage up to 50%. This clearly shows significantly less damage when using 405 nm wavelength. Similar results were obtained for the tested cell lines. Conclusions Crosslinking with 405 nm is better for pancreatic islets than crosslinking with 365 nm UV light."
https://openalex.org/W3037008990,"The breast cancer (BC) biomarker HER2 (Human Epidermal Receptor 2) is overexpressed in 25% of BC. Only patients with HER2-positive tumors receive HER2-targeting therapies, like trastuzumab (Herceptin). However, some women with a HER2-negative BC could benefit from trastuzumab. This could be explained by the activation/phosphorylation of HER2 that can be recognized by trastuzumab. The aim of this study is to examine trastuzumab effects on HER2 phosphorylation at tyrosine Y877 (pHER2Y877). HER2 and pHER2Y877 status were evaluated in a cohort of BC patients representative of molecular subtypes distribution (n = 497) and in a series of BC cell lines (n = 7). Immunohistochemistry against pHER2Y877 was performed on tissue micro arrays. Cellular proliferation assays were performed on BC cell lines presenting different combinations of HER2 and pHER2Y877 status and treated with increasing doses of trastuzumab (0-150 μg/ml). The prevalence of pHER2Y877 in this cohort was 6%. Nearly 5% of patients with HER2-negative tumors (n = 406, 82%) overexpressed pHER2Y877. Among triple negative BC patients (n = 39, 8%), 7.7% expressed pHER2Y877. Trastuzumab treatment decreased cell proliferation in HER2-/pHER2Y877+ BC cell lines, to an extent comparable to what occurs in HER2+ cell lines, but did not affect HER2-/pHER2Y877- cell lines. Trastuzumab sensitivity in HER2-/pHER2Y877+ cell line is specific to HER2 tyrosine 877 phosphorylation. Hence, with further confirmation in a bigger cohort, trastuzumab treatment could be envisaged as a treatment option to women presenting with HER2-/pHER2+ tumors, representing more than 1000 BC women in Canada in 2019."
https://openalex.org/W3037244322,"The pathogenesis of Salmonella Typhimurium depends on the bacterium’s ability to survive and replicate within host cells. The formation and maintenance of a unique membrane-bound compartment, termed the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), is essential for S. Typhimurium pathogenesis. SCV-bound S. Typhimurium induces formation of filamentous tubules that radiate outwards from the SCV, termed Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs). SIF formation is concomitant with the onset of replication within host epithelial cells. SIF biogenesis, formation and maintenance of the SCV, and the intracellular positioning of the SCV within the host cell requires translocation of bacterial proteins (effectors) into the host cell. Effectors secreted by the type III secretion system encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (T3SS2) function to interfere with host cellular processes and promote both intracellular survival and replication of S. Typhimurium. Seven T3SS2-secreted effectors, SifA, SopD2, PipB2, SteA, SseJ, SseF, and SseG have previously been implicated to play complementary, redundant, and/or antagonistic roles with respect to SIF biogenesis, intracellular positioning of the SCV, and SCV membrane dynamics modulation during infection. We undertook a systematic study to delineate the contribution of each effector to these processes by (i) deleting all seven of these effectors in a single S. Typhimurium strain; and (ii) deleting combinations of multiple effectors based on putative effector function. Using this deletion mutant library, we show that each of SIF biogenesis, intracellular SCV localization, intramacrophage replication, colonization, and virulence depends on the activities of multiple effectors. Together, our data demonstrates the complex interplay between these seven effectors and highlights the necessity to study T3SS2-secreted effectors as groups, rather than studies of individual effectors."
https://openalex.org/W3037023214,"Alphaviruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) are arboviruses that can cause severe zoonotic disease in humans. Both VEEV and EEEV are highly infectious when aerosolized and can be used as biological weapons. Vaccines and therapeutics are urgently needed, but efficacy determination requires animal models. The cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) provides a relevant model of human disease, but questions remain whether vaccines or therapeutics can mitigate CNS infection or disease in this model. The documentation of alphavirus encephalitis in animals relies on traditional physiological biomarkers and behavioral/neurological observations by veterinary staff; quantitative measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial pressure (ICP) can recapitulate underlying encephalitic processes. We detail a telemetry implantation method suitable for continuous monitoring of both EEG and ICP in awake macaques, as well as methods for collection and analysis of such data. We sought to evaluate whether changes in EEG/ICP suggestive of CNS penetration by virus would be seen after aerosol exposure of naïve macaques to VEEV IC INH9813 or EEEV V105 strains compared to mock-infection in a cohort of twelve adult cynomolgus macaques. Data collection ran continuously from at least four days preceding aerosol exposure and up to 50 days thereafter. EEG signals were processed into frequency spectrum bands (delta: [0.4 - 4Hz); theta: [4 - 8Hz); alpha: [8-12Hz); beta: [12-30] Hz) and assessed for viral encephalitis-associated changes against robust background circadian variation while ICP data was assessed for signal fidelity, circadian variability, and for meaningful differences during encephalitis. Results indicated differences in delta, alpha, and beta band magnitude in infected macaques, disrupted circadian rhythm, and proportional increases in ICP in response to alphavirus infection. This novel enhancement of the cynomolgus macaque model offers utility for timely determination of onset, severity, and resolution of encephalitic disease and for the evaluation of vaccine and therapeutic candidates."
https://openalex.org/W3037449038,"Background As Zimbabwe approaches epidemic control of HIV, programs now prioritize viral load over CD4 monitoring, making it difficult to identify persons living with HIV (PLHIV) suffering from advanced disease (AD). We present an analysis of cross-sectional ZIMPHIA data, highlighting PLHIV with AD and concurrent viral load suppression (VLS). Methods ZIMPHIA collected blood specimens for HIV testing from 22,501 consenting adults (ages 15 years and older); 3,466 PLHIV had CD4 and VL results. Household HIV testing used the national serial algorithm, and those testing positive then received point-of-care CD4 enumeration with subsequent VL testing. We used logistic regression analysis to explore factors associated with concurrent AD and VLS (<1000 copies/mL). All analyses were weighted to account for complex survey design. Results Of the 3,466 PLHIV in the survey with CD4 and VL results, 17% were found to have AD (CD4<200cells/mm3). Of all AD patients, 30% had VLS. Concurrent AD and VLS was associated with male sex (aOR 2.45 95%CI 1.61–3.72), older age (35–49 years [aOR 2.46 95%CI 1.03–5.91] and 50+ years [aOR 4.82 95%CI 2.02–11.46] vs 15–24 years), and ART duration (<6 months [aOR 0.46 95%CI 0.29–0.76] and 6–24 months [aOR 2.07 95%CI 1.35–3.17] vs more than 2 years). The relationship between sex and AD is driven by age with significant associations among men aged 25–34, (aOR 3.37 95%CI 1.35–8.41), 35–49 (aOR 5.13 95%CI 2.16–12.18), and 50+ (aOR 12.56 95%CI 4.82–32.72) versus men aged 15–24. Conclusions The percentage of PLHIV with AD and VLS illustrates the conundrum of decreased support for CD4 monitoring, as these patients may not receive appropriate clinical services for advanced HIV disease. In high-prevalence settings such as Zimbabwe, CD4 monitoring support warrants further consideration to differentiate care appropriately for the most vulnerable PLHIV. Males may need to be prioritized, given their over-representation in this sub-population."
https://openalex.org/W3037652660,"Background Although the benefits of antithrombotic drugs are indisputable to reduce thrombotic events, they carry a high risk of compromising patient safety. No previous studies investigated the implementation and (cost-) effectiveness of a hospital-based multidisciplinary antithrombotic team on bleeding and thrombotic outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to compare the proportion of patients with a composite end point consisting of one or more bleeding episodes or one or more thrombotic event from hospitalization until three months after hospitalization. Methods and findings A prospective, multicenter before-after intervention study was conducted in two Dutch hospitals. Adult patients hospitalized between October 2015 and December 2017 treated with anticoagulant therapy were included. The primary aim was to estimate the proportion of patients with a composite end point consisting of one or more bleeding episodes or one or more thrombotic event from hospitalization until three months after hospitalization. The intervention was the implementation of a multidisciplinary antithrombotic team focusing on education, medication reviews by pharmacists, implementing of local anticoagulant therapy guidelines based on national guidelines, patient counselling and medication reconciliation at admission and discharge. The primary endpoint was analysed using segmented linear regression. We obtained data for 1,886 patients: 941 patients were included in the usual care period and 945 patients in the intervention period. The S-team study showed that implementation of a multidisciplinary antithrombotic team over time significantly reduced the composite end point consisting of one or more bleeding episodes or one or more thrombotic event from hospitalization until three months after hospitalization in patients using anticoagulant drugs (-1.83% (-2.58% to -1.08%) per 2 month period). Conclusions This study shows that implementation of a multidisciplinary antithrombotic team over time significantly reduces the composite end point consisting of one or more bleeding episodes or one or more thrombotic event from hospitalization until three months after hospitalization in patients using anticoagulant drugs.

https://openalex.org/W3037959204,"The adoption of energy-efficient lighting systems such as light-emitting diode (LED) lights is an effective strategy to address global warming and climate change. The adoption of LED light usage is largely shaped by consumer behavior. Understanding the factors that influence consumers’ awareness of the advantages of using LED lights and consumers’ eventual buying behavior is critical to industry players and policy-makers. The objective of this study is to investigate the significant factors that affect consumer intention to use LED lights among Malaysian households. A survey questionnaire of 1,075 potential consumers was employed and the partial least squares technique was applied in data analysis. The results show that consumer awareness creates responsibility and influences consumers’ personal norms and attitudes, and their ultimate intention to buy LED lights. Feelings of guilt about contributing to air pollution and an awareness of the advantages of using LED lights both activate individual personal norms and attitudes, and influence the intention to buy LED lights. Awareness of the advantages of using LED lights, and of the negative consequences of not using them, prompts consumers to have feelings of guilt. The findings point to the importance of creating awareness among consumers."
https://openalex.org/W3037345993,"Bumble bee communities are strongly disrupted worldwide through the population decline of many species; a phenomenon that has been generally attributed to landscape modification, pesticide use, pathogens, and climate change. The mechanisms by which these causes act on bumble bee colonies are, however, likely to be complex and to involve many levels of organization spanning from the community down to the least understood individual level. Here, we assessed how the morphology, weight and foraging behavior of individual workers are affected by their surrounding landscape. We hypothesized that colonies established in landscapes showing high cover of intensive crops and low cover of flowering crops, as well as low amounts of local floral resources, would produce smaller workers, which would perform fewer foraging trips and collect pollen loads less constant in species composition. We tested these predictions with 80 colonies of commercially reared Bombus impatiens Cresson placed in 20 landscapes spanning a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Québec, Canada. We estimated weekly rate at which workers entered and exited colonies and captured eight workers per colony over a period of 14 weeks during the spring and summer of 2016. Captured workers had their wing, thorax, head, tibia, and dry weight measured, as well as their pollen load extracted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. We did not detect any effect of landscape habitat composition on worker morphology or body weight, but found that foraging activity decreased with intensive crops. Moreover, higher diversity of local floral resources led to lower pollen constancy in intensively cultivated landscapes. Finally, we found a negative correlation between the size of workers and the diversity of their pollen load. Our results provide additional evidence that conservation actions regarding pollinators in arable landscapes should be made at the landscape rather than at the farm level."
https://openalex.org/W3037838619,"Evidence exists that depression interacts with physical illness to amplify the impact of chronic conditions like diabetes. The co-occurrence of these two conditions leads to worse health outcomes and higher healthcare costs. This study seeks to understand what demographic and socio-economic indicators can be used to predict co-occurrence at both the state and the individual level. Diabetes and depression are modeled as a bivariate normal distribution using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2016–2017 cohorts. The tetrachoric (latent) correlation between diabetes and depression is 17.2% and statistically significant, however the likelihood of any person being diagnosed with both conditions is small—as high as 4.3% (Arizona) and as low as 2.3% (Utah). We find that demographic characteristics (sex, age, and race) operate in opposite directions in predicting diabetes and depression diagnosis. Behavioral indicators (BMI≥30, smoking, and exercise); and life outcomes, (schooling attainment, marital and veteran status) work in the same direction to produce co-occurrence and as such are more powerful predictors of co-occurrence than demographic characteristics. It is important to have a rapid and efficient instrument to diagnoses co-occurrence. Simple questions about lifestyle choices, educational attainment and family life could help bridge the gap between primary care and psychological services with beneficial spillovers for patient-doctor communication."
https://openalex.org/W3038117743,"Background Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of peer educator programs for diabetes management in low- and middle-income countries. However, little is known about peer educators’ impact relative to other treatment components such as medication and physician consultation. In Cambodia, the non-governmental organization MoPoTsyo organizes four services for people with diabetes: self-management training through peer educator visits, lab tests, physician consultations, and low-cost medicines. Our aims were to 1) quantify MoPoTsyo participant utilization of each program service and 2) define the relationship between each program service and glycemic control. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 4,210 MoPoTsyo participants, using data collected by MoPoTsyo from 2006–2016. Independent variables assessed were medication adherence, number of peer educator visits, number of physician consultations, and number of lab tests. A multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between these disease management services and glycemic control—fasting plasma glucose ≤130 mg/dl or post-prandial glucose ≤180 mg/dl—based on most recent glucose level. The model was adjusted for baseline demographic and disease characteristics. Findings Participants with 12 or more peer educator visits per year had a 35% higher odds of glycemic control relative to participants with 4 or fewer visits (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI: 1.08–1.69; p = 0.009), after adjustment for utilization of other treatment components (medication adherence, number of physician visits, number of lab tests), follow-up time, and demographic and disease characteristics. Better adherence to medications and a greater number of lab tests per year were also associated with a higher odds of glycemic control after adjustment. Number of physician consultations was not associated with glycemic control after adjustment. Conclusions This study demonstrates a positive association between peer educator utilization and glycemic control incremental to other elements of diabetes management. These results suggest that peer educators may be a valuable addition to comprehensive diabetes management programs in low- and middle-income countries even when other health care services are accessible. The associations identified in this research warrant further prospective studies to explore the causal impact of peer educators on glycemic control relative to other disease management components."
https://openalex.org/W3037613400,"Although progress has been made to improve access to sexual and reproductive health services globally in the past two decades, in many low-income countries, improvements have been slow. Discrimination against vulnerable groups and failure to address health inequities openly and comprehensively play a role in this stagnation. Healthcare practitioners are important actors who, often alone, decide who accesses services and how. This study explores how health care practitioners perceive sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and how background factors influence them during service delivery. Participants were a purposefully selected sample of health practitioners from five low income countries attending a training in at Lund University, Sweden. Semi-structured interviews and qualitative content analysis were used. Three themes emerged. The first theme, “one-size doesn’t fit all’ in SRHR” reflects health practitioners’ perception of SRHR. Although they perceived rights as fundamental to sexual and reproductive health, exercising of these rights was perceived to be context-specific. The second theme, “aligning a pathway to service delivery”, illustrates a reflective balancing act between their personal values and societal norms in service delivery, while the third theme, “health practitioners acting as gatekeepers”, describes how this balancing act oscillates between enabling and blocking behaviours. The findings suggest that, even though health care practitioners perceive SRHR as fundamental rights, their preparedness to ensure that these rights were upheld in service delivery is influenced by personal values and society norms. This could lead to actions that enable or block service delivery"
https://openalex.org/W3037642209,"Two low-phytate soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) mutant lines- V99-5089 (mips mutation on chromosome 11) and CX-1834 (mrp-l and mrp-n mutations on chromosomes 19 and 3, respectively) have proven to be valuable resources for breeding of low-phytate, high-sucrose, and low-raffinosaccharide soybeans, traits that are highly desirable from a nutritional and environmental standpoint. A recombinant inbred population derived from the cross CX1834 x V99-5089 provides an opportunity to study the effect of different combinations of these three mutations on soybean phytate and oligosaccharides levels. Of the 173 recombinant inbred lines tested, 163 lines were homozygous for various combinations of MIPS and two MRP loci alleles. These individuals were grouped into eight genotypic classes based on the combination of SNP alleles at the three mutant loci. The two genotypic classes that were homozygous mrp-l/mrp-n and either homozygous wild-type or mutant at the mips locus (MIPS/mrp-l/mrp-n or mips/mrp-l/mrp-n) displayed relatively similar ~55% reductions in seed phytate, 6.94 mg g -1 and 6.70 mg g-1 respectively, as compared with 15.2 mg g-1 in the wild-type MIPS/MRP-L/MRP-N seed. Therefore, in the presence of the double mutant mrp-l/mrp-n, the mips mutation did not cause a substantially greater decrease in seed phytate level. However, the nutritionally-desirable high-sucrose/low-stachyose/low-raffinose seed phenotype originally observed in soybeans homozygous for the mips allele was reversed in the presence of mrp-l/mrp-n mutations: homozygous mips/mrp-l/mrp-n seed displayed low-sucrose (7.70%), high-stachyose (4.18%), and the highest observed raffinose (0.94%) contents per gram of dry seed. Perhaps the block in phytic acid transport from its cytoplasmic synthesis site to its storage site, conditioned by mrp-l/mrp-n, alters myo-inositol flux in mips seeds in a way that restores to wild-type levels the mips conditioned reductions in raffinosaccharides. Overall this study determined the combinatorial effects of three low phytic acid causing mutations on regulation of seed phytate and oligosaccharides in soybean."
https://openalex.org/W3037518098,"Previous studies suggest that marathon running induces lower extremity muscle damage. This study aimed to examine inter- and intramuscular differences in hamstring muscle damage after a marathon using transverse relaxation time (T2)–weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). 20 healthy collegiate marathon runners (15 males) were recruited for this study. T2-MRI was performed before (PRE) and at 1 (D1), 3 (D3), and 8 days (D8) after marathon, and the T2 values of each hamstring muscle at the distal, middle, and proximal sites were calculated. Results indicated that no significant intermuscular differences in T2 changes were observed and that, regardless of muscle, the T2 values of the distal and middle sites increased significantly at D1 and D3 and recovered at D8, although those values of the proximal site remained constant. T2 significantly increased at distal and middle sites of the biceps femoris long head on D1 (p = 0.030 and p = 0.004, respectively) and D3 (p = 0.007 and p = 0.041, respectively), distal biceps femoris short head on D1 (p = 0.036), distal semitendinosus on D1 (p = 0.047) and D3 (p = 0.010), middle semitendinosus on D1 (p = 0.005), and distal and middle sites of the semimembranosus on D1 (p = 0.008 and p = 0.040, respectively) and D3 (p = 0.002 and p = 0.018, respectively). These results suggest that the distal and middle sites of the hamstring muscles are more susceptible to damage induced by running a full marathon. Conditioning that focuses on the distal and middle sites of the hamstring muscles may be more useful in improving recovery strategies after prolonged running."
https://openalex.org/W3038104387,"Summary of background data The vascular buds in the vertebral endplate (VEP) are the structural foundation of nutrient exchange in the intervertebral disc (IVD). VEGF is closely related to angiogenesis in the endplate and intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Objective To investigate the effects of static load on vascular buds and VEGF expression in the VEP and to further clarify the relation between IDD and VEGF. Methods IVD motion segments were harvested from rabbit lumbar spines and cultured under no-loading conditions (controls) or in custom-made apparatuses under a constant compressive load (0.5 MPa) for up to 14 days. Tissue integrity and the number of vascular buds were determined, and the concentrations and expression of Aggrecan, COL2a1, and VEGFA in the VEPs were assessed after 3, 7, and 14 days of culturing and then compared with those of fresh tissues. Results Under the constant compression, the morphological integrity of the VEPs was gradually disrupted, and immunohistochemistry results showed a significant decrease in the levels of Agg and COL2a1. During the static load, the number of vascular buds in the VEPs was gradually reduced from the early stage of culture, and ELISA showed that the constant compressive load caused a significant decrease in the VEGFA and VEGFR2 protein concentrations, which were consistent with the immunohistochemistry results. Western blot and RT-PCR results also showed that the loading state caused a significant decrease in VEGFA expression compared with that of fresh and control samples. Conclusions Constant compression caused degeneration of the VEP as well as a decreased number of vascular buds, thereby accelerating disc degeneration. VEGFA is involved in this process. We anticipate that regulating the expression of VEGFA may improve the condition of the lesions to the vascular buds in the endplates, thus enhancing the nutritional supply function in IVD and providing new therapeutic targets and strategies for the effective prevention and treatment of IDD."
https://openalex.org/W3037151918,"As a consequence of a hormonal imbalance, Prostatic Hyperplasia (PH) is characterized by increased prostate volume, along with higher local angiogenesis and vascularization. Orchiectomy is the common treatment for dogs, however it is not an option for breeding animals. Thus, finasteride arises as the drug of choice for stud dogs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of orchiectomy or finasteride therapies on hormonal and vascular dynamics of PH dogs. Fifteen dogs, aged 6–13 years were assigned to: Untreated Group (dogs diagnosed with PH—n = 5), Finasteride treated group (PH dogs treated with finasteride—n = 5) and Orchiectomy treated group (PH dogs submitted to orchiectomy–n = 5). Evaluations were performed in a monthly interval (first day of treatment; after 30 and 60 days). Doppler ultrasonography was performed to measure prostatic volume, vascularization and hemodynamic profile of prostatic artery. Dihydrotestosterone, estrogen and testosterone concentrations were measured. At day 60, prostatic biopsy was performed for histological, immunohistochemical and qPCR analysis for VEGF-A expression. At day 60, vascularization score was higher in untreated compared to treated groups (finasteride and orchiectomy). Furthermore, VEGF-A expression was lower in the Orchiectomy Treated Group, but VEGF-A was immunohistochemically lower in both treated groups (finasteride and orchiectomy) compared to the Untreated Group. The efficiency of finasteride treatment in reducing clinical signs, prostate volume and vascularization appears to be similar to orchiectomy. In conclusion, both PH medical and surgical therapy lead to reduction in prostate dimension and VEGF-A expression and, consequently, lower local vascularization. However, orchiectomy promotes marked hormonal changes, which ultimately lead to prostate atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3038104665,"Introduction A growing number of patients started renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Western industrialized countries between 1980 an early 2000s. Thereafter reports from national and international registries suggest a trend towards stabilization and sometimes a decrease in the incidence rate. Aim To investigate the differences in overall and age-specific incidence rates between industrialized countries from 1998 until 2013. Secondly, to investigate changes in incidence rates over time and their association with specific age categories. Method We extracted the unadjusted overall incidence of RRT and age-specific incidence rates from renal registry reports in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Time trends in the incidence rate by country and age categories were analyzed by Joinpoint regression analysis. Results The incidence rate in 2013 ranged from 89 per million population (pmp) in Finland to 363 pmp in the US. Incidence rates in the lower age categories (20–64 year) were similar between countries and remained stable over time. Higher incidence countries were characterized by higher numbers of patients in both the 65–74 and ≥75 year categories starting RRT. Joinpoint analysis confirmed that most countries had significant reductions in the incidence rate at the end of the study period. These reductions were explained by lower numbers of older patients starting RRT and were observed also in countries with lower overall incidence rates. Conclusion This study confirmed different incidence rates of RRT between industrialized countries worldwide. Countries with the highest overall incidence rates also had the highest incidence rates in the oldest age categories. Since the early 2000’s the number of older patients starting RRT is either stabilizing or even decreasing in most countries. This reduction is universal and is also observed in countries with previously low incidence rates."
https://openalex.org/W3037213009,"Research suggests that people behave more cooperatively towards those who smile and less cooperatively towards those with personality pathology. Here, we integrated these two lines of research to model the combined effects of smiles and personality pathology on trust. In two experiments, participants read vignettes portraying a person with either borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, or no personality pathology. These portrayals were paired with a brief video clip that showed a person with either a neutral expression or a smile. Participants then played a Trust game with the ""person"" presented using each vignette and video clip combination. In Experiment 1, rates of trust were lower in response to the borderline and antisocial personality disorder vignettes compared with the control vignette. Interestingly, the effect of smiles was dependent upon personality. Although participants were more trusting of smiling confederates portrayed as having borderline personality disorder or no pathology, they were less trusting of confederates portrayed as having antisocial personality disorder if they smiled. In Experiment 2, run with a second set of personality vignettes, rates of trust were lower in response to both personality disorder vignettes and higher in response to smiles with no significant interaction. Together, these results suggest that information regarding both the current emotional state as well as the personality traits of a partner are important for creating trust."
https://openalex.org/W3037546145,"Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins are two important plant secondary metabolites, and they contribute to plant survival and human health. In particular, proanthocyanidins could also prevent ruminants from the damage of pasture bloat. However, the improvement of proanthocyanidins content remain unsatisfied. In this study, we attempted to improve proanthocyanidins level by gene stacking in Arabidopsis thaliana as prove-of-concept. Two proanthocyanidin pathway genes from tea plant, CsF3'5'H and CsANR2, were co-expressed in the wild type and PAP1 over-expression Arabidopsis. Over-expression of CsF3'5'H slightly affected anthocyanins level in leaves and proanthocyanidins in mature seed when expressed alone in the pap1-D line. Over-expression of CsANR2 led to an obvious decrease in anthocyanins in leaves of both wild type and pap1-D lines, but increase in proanthocyanidin level in mature seeds. Over-expression of CsANR2 in pap1-D lines lead to production of DMACA-reactive soluble proanthocyanidins in leaves, but not in wild type or pap1-D lines. Anthocyanins level was decreased in the leaves of CsF3'5'H, CsANR2 and pap1-D co-expression lines, but proanthocyanidins were increased remarkably in both leaves and mature seeds in the co-expression line. It is concluded that co-expression of CsANR2 and PAP1 in Arabidopsis produce soluble proanthocyanidins in leaves, and co-expression of CsF3'5'H, CsANR2 and PAP1 lead to a significant increase in proanthocyanidins in mature seeds. The transcript levels of endogenous CHS, DFR, ANS and ANR genes in Arabidopsis were up-regulated in the triple genes co-expression line. Based on these studies, it is possible to develop new plant germplasm with improved proanthocyanidins by co-expressing of multiple genes."
https://openalex.org/W3037755137,"This longitudinal mixed methods experimental study aimed to better understand the interplay between digital technology exposure over time, self-efficacy, and prosocial behavior in everyday contexts.66 psychology students tracked their daily prosocial behavior over three weeks. Additionally, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive access to an online platform, which made personalized suggestions for prosocial actions to complete. Qualitative post-study interviews complemented quantitative measures.Platform exposure had no measurable impact beyond that of tracking over time on either prosocial behavior or self-efficacy. Tracking increased self-efficacy to perform everyday prosocial actions, but did not affect self-efficacy to impact change. Prosocial behavior was predicted by self-efficacy to impact change. Enjoyment of the platform predicted completing higher numbers of suggested prosocial actions and was related to a higher likelihood to continue using the platform in the future. Avenues for increasing platform effectiveness include context-specific action personalization, an effective reminder system, and better support for the development of self-efficacy to impact change through meaningful actions.Technology for prosocial behavior should be enjoyable, capable of being seamlessly integrated into everyday life, and ensure that suggested actions are perceived as meaningful in order to support the sustainable development of self-efficacy and prosocial behavior over time."

As a result, the Guinean Ministry of Health is collaborating with international partners to improve compliance with the International Health Regulations and work toward the Global Health Security Agenda goals, including enhanced case- and community-based disease surveillance. We assessed the case-based disease surveillance system during October 1, 2015-March 31, 2016, in the Boffa prefecture of Guinea. We conducted onsite interviews with public health staff at the peripheral (health center), middle (prefectural), and central (Ministry of Health) levels of the public health system to document leadership structure; methods for maintaining case registers and submitting weekly case reports; disease surveillance feedback; data analysis; and baseline surveillance information on four epidemic-prone diseases (cholera, meningococcal meningitis, measles, and yellow fever). The surveillance system was simple and paper-based at health centers and computer spreadsheet-based at the prefectural and central levels. Surveillance feedback to stakeholders at all levels was infrequent. Data analysis activities were minimal at the peripheral levels and progressively more robust at the prefectural and central levels. Reviewing the surveillance reports from Boffa during the study period, we observed zero reported cases of the four epidemic-prone diseases in the weekly reporting from the peripheral to the central level. Similarly, the national District Health Information System 2 had no reported cases of the four diseases in Boffa but did indicate reported cases among all four neighboring prefectures. Based on the assessment findings, which suggest low sensitivity of the case-based disease surveillance system in Boffa, we recommend additional training and support to improve surveillance data quality and enhance Guinean public health workforce capacity to use these data."
https://openalex.org/W3037793920,"Erythropoisis stimulating agent (ESA) use was addressed in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) meetings between 2004 and 2008. FDA safety-focused regulatory actions occurred in 2007 and 2008. In 2007, black box warnings advised of early death and venous thromboembolism (VTE) risks with ESAs in oncology. In 2010, a Risk Evaluation Strategies (REMS) was initiated, with cancer patient consent that mortality and VTE risks were noted with ESAs. We report warnings and REMS impacts on ESA utilization among Veterans Administration (VA) cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). Data were from Veterans Affairs database (2003-2012). Epoetin and darbepoetin use were primary outcomes. Segmented linear regression was used to estimate changes in ESA use levels and trends, clinical appropriateness, and adverse events (VTEs) among chemotherapy-treated cancer patients. To estimate changes in level of drug prescription rate after policy actions, model-specific indicator variables as covariates based on specific actions were included. ESA use fell by 95% and 90% from 2005, for epoetin and darbepoetin, from 22% and 11%, respectively, to 1% and 1%, respectively, among cancer patients with CIA, respectively (p<0.01). Following REMS in 2010, mean hematocrit levels at ESA initiation decreased from 30% to 21% (p<0.01). Black box warnings preceded decreased ESA use among VA cancer patients with CIA. REMS was followed by reduced hematocrit levels at ESA initiation. Our findings contrast with privately- insured and Medicaid insured cancer patient data on chemotherapy-induced anemia where ESA use decreased to 3% to 7% by 2010-2012. By 2012, the era of ESA administration to VA to cancer patients had ended but the warnings remain relevant and significant. In 2019, oncology/hematology national guidelines (ASCO/ASH) recommend that cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia should receive ESAs or red blood cell transfusions after risk-benefit evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3038039756,"A brief session of rightward prismatic adaptation (R-PA) has been shown to alleviate neglect symptoms in patients with right hemispheric damage, very likely by switching hemispheric dominance of the ventral attentional network (VAN) from the right to the left and by changing task-related activity within the dorsal attentional network (DAN). We have investigated this very rapid change in functional organisation with a network approach by comparing resting-state connectivity before and after a brief exposure i) to R-PA (14 normal subjects; experimental condition) or ii) to plain glasses (12 normal subjects; control condition). A whole brain analysis (comprising 129 regions of interest) highlighted R-PA-induced changes within a bilateral, fronto-temporal network, which consisted of 13 nodes and 11 edges; all edges involved one of 4 frontal nodes, which were part of VAN. The analysis of network characteristics within VAN and DAN revealed a R-PA-induced decrease in connectivity strength between nodes and a decrease in local efficiency within VAN but not within DAN. These results indicate that the resting-state connectivity configuration of VAN is modulated by R-PA, possibly by decreasing its modularity."
https://openalex.org/W3037205316,"Heart failure (HF) is an increasing global health crisis, affecting 40 million people and causing 50% mortality within 5 years of diagnosis. A fuller understanding of the genetic and environmental factors underlying HF, and novel therapeutic approaches to address it, are urgently warranted. Here, we discovered that cardiac-specific germline deletion in mice of potassium channel β subunit-encoding Kcne2 (Kcne2CS-/- ) causes dilated cardiomyopathy and terminal HF (median longevity, 28 weeks). Mice with global Kcne2 deletion (Kcne2Glo-/- ) exhibit multiple HF risk factors, yet, paradoxically survived over twice as long as Kcne2CS-/- mice. Global Kcne2 deletion, which inhibits gastric acid secretion, reduced the relative abundance of species within Bacteroidales, a bacterial order that positively correlates with increased lifetime risk of human cardiovascular disease. Strikingly, the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole similarly altered the microbiome and delayed terminal HF in Kcne2CS-/- mice, increasing survival 10-fold at 44 weeks. Thus, genetic or pharmacologic induction of hypochlorhydria and decreased gut Bacteroidales species are associated with lifespan extension in a novel HF model."

https://openalex.org/W3037287029,"Overweight and obesity (O&O) is a risk factor for several health conditions and can result in a shorter lifespan for cats. The objectives of this study were to investigate (a) cat owners' attitudes towards feline O&O and their associations with O&O in their cats; and (b) the risk factors for feline O&O and underweight, particularly those involving owner practice. An online survey comprising questions related to cat owners' attitudes towards feline O&O, owner-reported body weight and body condition of their cat, and potential risk factors for feline O&O was conducted. Primarily targeting the Australian population, the survey attracted 1,390 valid responses. In response to ten attitude-related questions, more participants (percentage range among the ten questions: 39.1-76.6%) held a disapproving attitude towards feline O&O than a neutral (17.1-31.9%) or approving attitude (3.9-27.7%). A greater proportion of participants had a more disapproving attitude towards obesity than towards overweight. Cats belonging to owners with an approving attitude towards O&O were more likely to be overweight or obese than cats belonging to owners with a disapproving attitude towards O&O. The cats had particularly high odds of overweight or obesity if their owner agreed that 'being chubby says that the cat has a quality life' (OR: 3.75, 95% CI: 2.41-5.82) and 'being fat says that the cat has a quality life' (OR: 4.98, 95%CI: 2.79-8.91). This study revealed, for the first time, that begging for food was a risk factor for O&O in cats. Other important feline risk factors for O&O identified included being middle-aged, being mixed-breed, dry food as the major diet, the amount of feed not being quantified, and frequently spending time indoors. Being over 11 years, receiving no dry food and receiving measured amounts of feed were associated with an increased odds of underweight in cats. As specific attitudes often lead to certain behaviours, reducing approving attitudes towards feline O&O may potentially reduce the frequency of O&O and the risks of O&O-related disorders in cats."
https://openalex.org/W3037400436,"Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion is a potential candidate for dealing with the stringent regulations on vehicle emissions while still providing very good energy efficiency. Despite the promising results obtained in preliminary studies, the lack of autoignition control has delayed its launch in the engine industry. In the development of the HCCI concept, the availability of reliable computer models has proved extremely valuable, due to their flexibility and lower cost compared with experiments using real engines. In order to obtain the best formulation of a fuel surrogate formulated with n-heptane, toluene and cyclohexane that efficiently estimate the autoignition behaviour, regression adjustments are made to the Root-Mean-Square Errors (RMSE) of experimental Starts of Combustion (SOC) from the modeled SOC. The canonical form of the Scheffé polynomials is widely used to fit the data from mixture experiments, however the experimenter might have only partial knowledge. In this paper we present the adaptation of the robust methodology for possibly misspecified blending model and an algorithm to obtain tailor-made optimal designs for mixture experiments, instead of using standard designs which are indiscriminately employed, to make good estimations of the parameters blending model. We maximize the determinant of the mean squared error matrix of the least square estimator over a realistic neighbourhood of the fitted regression mixture model. The maximized determinant is then minimized over the class of possible designs, yielding an optimal design. Thus, the computed desings are robust to the exact form of the true blending model. Standard mixture designs, as the simplex lattice, are around 25% efficient for estimation purposes compared with the designs obtained in this work when deviances from the considered model occur during the experiments. Once an optimal-robust design was selected (based on the level of certainty about model adequacy), we computed the optimal mixture that best reproduces the combustion property to be imitated. Optimal mixtures obtained when the considered model is inadequate agree with the results achieved in empirical studies, which validates the methodology proposed in this work."

However, little is known about the respiratory microorganisms in patients with endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB), which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the tracheobronchial tree due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. We retrospectively reviewed data for histopathologically and microbiologically confirmed EBTB patients diagnosed at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea between January 2013 and January 2019. Bacterial cultures were performed on bronchial washing from these patients at the time of EBTB diagnosis. A total of 216 patients with EBTB were included in the study. The median age was 73 years and 142 (65.7%) patients were female. Bacteria were detected in 42 (19.4%) patients. Additionally, bacterial co-infection was present in 6 (2.8%) patients. Apart from MTB, the most common microorganisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 14, 33.3%) followed by Klebsiella species (n = 12, 28.6%; 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 Klebsiella oxytoca), Streptococcus species (n = 5, 11.9%), Enterobacter species (n = 4, 9.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3, 7.1%).

Methods Prospective study using the data collected at baseline and at the first 12 month-follow-up for the 18,018 participants included in the population-based Constances cohort between 2012 and 2015. CTS at follow-up and exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals at baseline were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between CTS and co-exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals were studied using multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for personal/medical factors. Results 184 men (2.1%, 95%CI 1.8–2.4) and 331 women (3.6%, 3.2–3.9) free from chronic hand symptoms at baseline declared suffering from unilateral/bilateral CTS at follow-up. A potentiating effect of co-exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals on the risk of CTS was found for both genders, with higher OR in the co-exposure group (OR = 3.38 [2.29–5.01] in men and OR = 4.12 [2.73–6.21] in women) than in the biomechanical exposure group (OR = 2.14 [1.51–3.03] in men and OR = 2.19 [1.72–2.78] in women) compared to no exposure group. Conclusions The study showed an association between CTS and co-exposure to biomechanical wrist stressors and chemicals, after adjustment for the main personal and medical factors. This finding should be confirmed using more objective case definition of CTS and assessment of the chemical exposure before drawing conclusions on the possible synergistic effects of mechanical stressors and chemical on the median nerve."
https://openalex.org/W3037527559,"From year-to-year, environment is becoming one of the major concerns of human societies. Few studies have investigated the biological processes involved in environmental scene perception. Here, we initiate a line of research by beginning to study emotional processes involved in this perception. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between “Clean” and “Polluted” environments according to the pleasure and approach desire ratings they induced. Moreover, women expressed higher pleasure in the “Clean” condition, as did older participants. Finally, rural scenes induced higher pleasure in participants than urban ones."
https://openalex.org/W3037755369,"The importance of social connection to well-being is underscored by individuals' reactivity to events highlighting the potential for rejection and exclusion, which extends even to observing the social exclusion of others (""vicarious ostracism""). Because responses to vicarious ostracism depend at least in part on empathy with the target, and individuals tend to empathize less readily with outgroup than ingroup members, the question arises as to whether there is a boundary condition on vicarious ostracism effects whereby individuals are relatively immune to observing ingroup-on-outgroup ostracism. Of particular interest is the case where members of a dominant ethnic group observe fellow ingroup members ostracize a member of a disadvantaged ethnic minority group, as here there is a compelling potential alternative: Perceived violation of contemporary social norms condemning prejudice and discrimination might instead lead dominant group members to be especially upset by ""dominant-on-disadvantaged"" ostracism. Accordingly, the present research examines, across four studies and 4413 participants, individuals' affective reactions to observing dominant-on-disadvantaged versus dominant-on-dominant ostracism. In each study, dominant group members (White/Europeans) observed dominant group members include or ostracize a fellow dominant group member or a disadvantaged ethnic minority group member (a Black individual) in an online Cyberball game. Results revealed that dominant group members felt more guilt, anger, and sadness after observing severe ostracism of a disadvantaged as opposed to dominant group member. Although no direct effects emerged on behavioral outcomes, exploratory analyses suggested that observing ostracism of a disadvantaged (versus dominant) group member had indirect effects on behavior via increased feelings of anger. These results suggest that observing ostracism may be a sufficiently potent and relatable experience that when it occurs across group boundaries it awakens individuals' sensitivity to injustice and discrimination."

We studied gender-based differences in predictors of metabolic syndrome (MetS) resolution among newly diagnosed MetS patients. This study was a secondary analysis of a prospective clinical trial study comprising of 637 middle-aged and older adults (226 men and 411 women) who underwent a regular health checkup and were newly diagnosed with MetS at 16 different health clinics of 14 metropolitan cities and provinces. We conducted Cox proportional hazard analysis to estimate cumulative probability of MetS resolution within a 12-month observation period. Among the 637 patients, 47.6% of participants achieved MetS resolution. The resolution rate was similar among men and women (44.7% and 49.1%, respectively, P = 0.320). Low household income (Hazard ratio = 2.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.13-6.08) and current employment (2.29, 1.26-4.13) were associated with a higher cumulative probability of MetS resolution in men than in women. For women, however, longer sleeping hours (1.18, 1.04-1.34) and living with a partner (1.58, 1.06-2.35) were positive predictors of MetS resolution. Being overweight (0.63, 0.44-0.89) was associated with lower cumulative probability of MetS resolution in women than in men. The factors associated with cumulative probability of MetS resolution within the 12-month follow-up were different between men and women. These findings facilitate further exploration on gender-based differences in risk factors for less optimal improvements in MetS."
https://openalex.org/W3038109376,"When we perform an action, the outcome that follows it can change the value we place on that behaviour, making it more or less likely to be repeated in the future. However, the values that we learn are not objective: we interpret the outcomes that we receive for ourselves relative to those that share our environment, i.e. we engage in social comparison. The temporal dynamics of physiological responses to stimulus valuation in social learning tasks are poorly understood, particularly in human participants. Therefore, we recorded stimulus-locked event-related potentials with 64-channel EEG to examine stimulus valuation, following the design of a study previously used in macaques. Pairs of participants performed a social learning task in which they received outcomes sequentially for a presented stimulus (partner first) by pressing a button in response to a cue. There were two conditions: one in which stimulus values varied for the participant but output a constant rate of reward for the partner (self-variable blocks), and another condition in which this payout was reversed (other-variable blocks). We then measured participants’ self-reported competitiveness. Approximately 200 ms post-stimulus, an ERP related to stimulus evaluation and attentional processing appeared to encode own stimulus value in self-variable blocks. In other-variable blocks the same pattern of activity was reversed, even though the value of the stimulus for the participant did not depend on the stimulus presented. Outcome-locked analyses further showed that attention dedicated to the partner’s outcome was greater in more competitive participants. We conclude that subjective stimulus value can be reflected in early stimulus-locked ERP responses and that competitive participants may be more invested in their own performance relative to the other player, hence their increased interest in the outcome of their partner."
