https://openalex.org/W2025613570,"The actions of environmental toxicants and relevant mixtures in promoting the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of ovarian disease was investigated with the use of a fungicide, a pesticide mixture, a plastic mixture, dioxin and a hydrocarbon mixture. After transient exposure of an F0 gestating female rat during embryonic gonadal sex determination, the F1 and F3 generation progeny adult onset ovarian disease was assessed. Transgenerational disease phenotypes observed included an increase in cysts resembling human polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) and a decrease in the ovarian primordial follicle pool size resembling primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). The F3 generation granulosa cells were isolated and found to have a transgenerational effect on the transcriptome and epigenome (differential DNA methylation). Epigenetic biomarkers for environmental exposure and associated gene networks were identified. Epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of ovarian disease states was induced by all the different classes of environmental compounds, suggesting a role of environmental epigenetics in ovarian disease etiology."
https://openalex.org/W1979588348,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by an excessive focus on upsetting or disturbing thoughts, feelings, and images that are internally-generated. Internally-focused thought processes are subserved by the ""default mode network"" (DMN), which has been found to be hyperactive in OCD during cognitive tasks. In healthy individuals, disengagement from internally-focused thought processes may rely on interactions between DMN and a fronto-parietal network (FPN) associated with external attention and task execution. Altered connectivity between FPN and DMN may contribute to the dysfunctional behavior and brain activity found in OCD.The current study examined interactions between FPN and DMN during rest in 30 patients with OCD (17 unmedicated) and 32 control subjects (17 unmedicated). Timecourses from seven fronto-parietal seeds were correlated across the whole brain and compared between groups.OCD patients exhibited altered connectivity between FPN seeds (primarily anterior insula) and several regions of DMN including posterior cingulate cortex, medial frontal cortex, posterior inferior parietal lobule, and parahippocampus. These differences were driven largely by a reduction of negative correlations among patients compared to controls. Patients also showed greater positive connectivity between FPN and regions outside DMN, including thalamus, lateral frontal cortex, and somatosensory/motor regions.OCD is associated with abnormal intrinsic functional connectivity between large-scale brain networks. Alteration of interactions between FPN and DMN at rest may contribute to aspects of the OCD phenotype, such as patients' inability to disengage from internally-generated scenarios and thoughts when performing everyday tasks requiring external attention."
https://openalex.org/W2054011804,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mainly function as post-transcriptional regulators and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Mouse testes express a large number of miRNAs. However, the physiological roles of these testicular miRNAs remain largely unknown. Using microarray and quantitative real time PCR assays, we identified that miRNAs of the microRNA-449 (miR-449) cluster were preferentially expressed in the mouse testis, and their levels were drastically up-regulated upon meiotic initiation during testicular development and in adult spermatogenesis. The expression pattern of the miR-449 cluster resembled that of microRNA-34b/c (miR-34b/c) during spermatogenesis. Further analyses identified that cAMP-responsive element modulator τ and SOX5, two transcription factors essential for regulating male germ cell gene expression, acted as the upstream transactivators to stimulate the expression of the miR-449 cluster in mouse testes. Despite its abundant expression in testicular germ cells, miR-449-null male mice developed normally and exhibited normal spermatogenesis and fertility. Our data further demonstrated that miR-449 shared a cohort of target genes that belong to the E2F transcription factor-retinoblastoma protein pathway with the miR-34 family, and levels of miR-34b/c were significantly up-regulated in miR-449-null testes. Taken together, our data suggest that the miR-449 cluster and miR-34b/c function redundantly in the regulation of male germ cell development in murine testes."
https://openalex.org/W2070343769,"Malaria is a major global health problem. Pregnant women are susceptible to infection regardless of previously acquired immunity. Placental malaria is caused by parasites capable of sequestering in the placenta. This is mediated by VAR2CSA, a parasite antigen that interacts with chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). One vaccine strategy is to block this interaction with VAR2CSA-specific antibodies. It is a priority to define a small VAR2CSA fragment that can be used in an adhesion blocking vaccine. In this, the obvious approach is to define regions of VAR2CSA involved in receptor binding. It has been shown that full-length recombinant VAR2CSA binds specifically to CSA with nanomolar affinity, and that the CSA-binding site lies in the N-terminal part of the protein. In this study we define the minimal binding region by truncating VAR2CSA and analyzing CSA binding using biosensor technology. We show that the core CSA-binding site lies within the DBL2X domain and parts of the flanking interdomain regions. This is in contrast to the idea that single domains do not possess the structural requirements for specific CSA binding. Small-angle x-ray scattering measurements enabled modeling of VAR2CSA and showed that the CSA-binding DBL2X domain is situated in the center of the structure. Mutating classic sulfate-binding sites in VAR2CSA, along with testing dependence of ionic interactions, suggest that the CSA binding is not solely dependent on the sulfated CSA structure. Based on these novel PfEMP1 structure-function studies, we have constructed a small VAR2CSA antigen that has the capacity to induce highly adhesion-blocking antibodies."

It is well established that the nuclear lamina preferentially associates with repressed chromatin. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying repressive chromatin formation and maintenance at the nuclear lamina remain poorly understood. Here we show that emerin binds directly to HDAC3, the catalytic subunit of the nuclear co-repressor (NCoR) complex, and recruits HDAC3 to the nuclear periphery. Emerin binding stimulated the catalytic activity of HDAC3, and emerin-null cells exhibit increased H4K5 acetylation, which is the preferred target of the NCoR complex. Emerin-null cells exhibit an epigenetic signature similar to that seen in HDAC3-null cells. Emerin-null cells also had significantly less HDAC3 at the nuclear lamina. Collectively, these data support a model whereby emerin facilitates repressive chromatin formation at the nuclear periphery by increasing the catalytic activity of HDAC3.

https://openalex.org/W1984815704,"The age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has been associated with the development of retinal diseases, particularly age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease. A major component of lipofuscin is the bis-retinoid N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E). The current model for the formation of A2E requires photoactivation of rhodopsin and subsequent release of all-trans-retinal. To understand the role of light exposure in the accumulation of lipofuscin and A2E, we analyzed RPEs and isolated rod photoreceptors from mice of different ages and strains, reared either in darkness or cyclic light. Lipofuscin levels were determined by fluorescence imaging, whereas A2E levels were quantified by HPLC and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The identity of A2E was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Lipofuscin and A2E levels in the RPE increased with age and more so in the Stargardt model Abca4−/− than in the wild type strains 129/sv and C57Bl/6. For each strain, the levels of lipofuscin precursor fluorophores in dark-adapted rods and the levels and rates of increase of RPE lipofuscin and A2E were not different between dark-reared and cyclic light-reared animals. Both 11-cis- and all-trans-retinal generated lipofuscin-like fluorophores when added to metabolically compromised rod outer segments; however, it was only 11-cis-retinal that generated such fluorophores when added to metabolically intact rods. The results suggest that lipofuscin originates from the free 11-cis-retinal that is continuously supplied to the rod for rhodopsin regeneration and outer segment renewal. The physiological role of Abca4 may include the translocation of 11-cis-retinal complexes across the disk membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1981868577,"Cytosolic free NAD/NADH ratio is fundamentally important in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis but current techniques cannot distinguish between protein-bound and free NAD/NADH. Williamson et al reported a method to estimate this ratio by cytosolic lactate/pyruvate (L/P) based on the principle of chemical equilibrium. Numerous studies used L/P ratio to estimate the cytosolic free NAD/NADH ratio by assuming that the conversion in cells was at near-equilibrium but not verifying how near it was. In addition, it seems accepted that cytosolic free NAD/NADH ratio was a dependent variable responding to the change of L/P ratio. In this study, we show (1) that the change of lactate/glucose (percentage of glucose that converts to lactate by cells) and L/P ratio could measure the status of conversion between pyruvate + NADH and lactate + NAD that tends to or gets away from equilibrium; (2) that cytosolic free NAD/NADH could be accurately estimated by L/P only when the conversion is at or very close to equilibrium otherwise a calculation error by one order of magnitude could be introduced; (3) that cytosolic free NAD/NADH is stable and L/P is highly labile, that the highly labile L/P is crucial to maintain the homeostasis of NAD/NADH; (4) that cytosolic free NAD/NADH is dependent on oxygen levels. Our study resolved the key issues regarding accurate estimation of cytosolic free NAD/NADH ratio and the relationship between NAD/NADH and L/P."
https://openalex.org/W2165248161,"T cells lacking TRAF1 hyperproliferate in response to T cell receptor signaling but have impaired signaling downstream of specific TNFR family members such as 4-1BB. Here we resolve this paradox by showing that while TRAF1 is required for maximal activation of the classical NF-κB pathway downstream of 4-1BB in primary T cells, TRAF1 also restricts the constitutive activation of NIK in anti-CD3-activated T cells. Activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway is restricted in unstimulated cells by a cIAP1/2:TRAF2:TRAF3:NIK complex. Using knockdown of NIK by siRNA we show that in activated CD8 T cells TRAF1 is also involved in this process and that constitutive activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway is responsible for costimulation independent hyperproliferation and excess cytokine production in TRAF1-deficient CD8 T cells compared with WT CD8 T cells. The T cell costimulatory molecule 4-1BB critically regulates the survival of activated and memory CD8 T cells. We demonstrate that stimulation through 4-1BB induces cIAP1-dependent TRAF3 degradation and activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway. We also show that while both TRAF1 and cIAP1 have non-redundant roles in suppressing the alternative NF-κB pathway in T cells activated in the absence of costimulation, activation of the classical NF-κB pathway downstream of 4-1BB requires TRAF1, whereas cIAP1 plays a redundant role with cIAP2. Collectively these results demonstrate that TRAF1 plays a critical role in regulating T cell activation both through restricting the costimulation independent activation of NIK in activated T cells and by promoting the 4-1BB-induced classical NF-κB pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2146561080,"Background Heart rate (HR) is an emerging risk factor in coronary artery disease (CAD). However, there is little contemporary data regarding HR and the use of HR-lowering medications, particularly beta-blockers, among patients with stable CAD in routine clinical practice. The goal of the present analysis was to describe HR in such patients, overall and in relation to beta-blocker use, and to describe the determinants of HR. Methods and Findings CLARIFY is an international, prospective, observational, longitudinal registry of outpatients with stable CAD, defined as prior myocardial infarction or revascularization procedure, evidence of coronary stenosis of >50%, or chest pain associated with proven myocardial ischemia. A total of 33,438 patients from 45 countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Middle East, and Asia/Pacific were enrolled between November 2009 and July 2010. Most of the 33,177 patients included in this analysis were men (77.5%). Mean (SD) age was 64.2 (10.5) years, HR by pulse was 68.3 (10.6) bpm, and by electrocardiogram was 67.2 (11.4) bpm. Overall, 44.0% had HR≥70 bpm. Beta-blockers were used in 75.1% of patients and another 14.4% had intolerance or contraindications to beta-blocker therapy. Among 24,910 patients on beta-blockers, 41.1% had HR≥70 bpm. HR≥70 bpm was independently associated with higher prevalence and severity of angina, more frequent evidence of myocardial ischemia, and lack of use of HR-lowering agents. Conclusions Despite a high rate of use of beta-blockers, stable CAD patients often have resting HR≥70 bpm, which was associated with an overall worse health status, more frequent angina and ischemia. Further HR lowering is possible in many patients with CAD. Whether it will improve symptoms and outcomes is being tested. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN43070564"
https://openalex.org/W2093002238,"Intestinal hormones are key regulators of digestion and energy homeostasis secreted by rare enteroendocrine cells. These cells produce over ten different hormones including GLP-1 and GIP peptides known to promote insulin secretion. To date, the molecular mechanisms controlling the specification of the various enteroendocrine subtypes from multipotent Neurog3(+) endocrine progenitor cells, as well as their number, remain largely unknown. In contrast, in the embryonic pancreas, the opposite activities of Arx and Pax4 homeodomain transcription factors promote islet progenitor cells towards the different endocrine cell fates. In this study, we thus investigated the role of Arx and Pax4 in enteroendocrine subtype specification. The small intestine and colon of Arx- and Pax4-deficient mice were analyzed using histological, molecular, and lineage tracing approaches. We show that Arx is expressed in endocrine progenitors (Neurog3(+)) and in early differentiating (ChromograninA(-)) GLP-1-, GIP-, CCK-, Sct- Gastrin- and Ghrelin-producing cells. We noted a dramatic reduction or a complete loss of all these enteroendocrine cell types in Arx mutants. Serotonin- and Somatostatin-secreting cells do not express Arx and, accordingly, the differentiation of Serotonin cells was not affected in Arx mutants. However, the number of Somatostatin-expressing D-cells is increased as Arx-deficient progenitor cells are redirected to the D-cell lineage. In Pax4-deficient mice, the differentiation of Serotonin and Somatostatin cells is impaired, as well as of GIP and Gastrin cells. In contrast, the number of GLP-1 producing L-cells is increased concomitantly with an upregulation of Arx. Thus, while Arx and Pax4 are necessary for the development of L- and D-cells respectively, they conversely restrict D- and L-cells fates suggesting antagonistic functions in D/L cell allocation. In conclusion, these finding demonstrate that, downstream of Neurog3, the specification of a subset of enteroendocrine subtypes relies on both Arx and Pax4, while others depend only on Arx or Pax4."
https://openalex.org/W2166257309,"A central hypothesis of ecological immunology is that immune defences are traded off against competing physiological and behavioural processes. During energetically demanding periods, birds are predicted to switch from expensive inflammatory responses to less costly immune responses. Acute phase responses (APRs) are a particularly costly form of immune defence, and, hence, seasonal modulations in APRs are expected. Yet, hypotheses about APR modulation remain untested in free-living organisms throughout a complete annual cycle. We studied seasonal modulations in the APRs and in the energy budgets of skylarks Alauda arvensis, a partial migrant bird from temperate zones that experiences substantial ecological changes during its annual cycle. We characterized throughout the annual cycle changes in their energy budgets by measuring basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body mass. We quantified APRs by measuring the effects of a lipopolysaccharide injection on metabolic rate, body mass, body temperature, and concentrations of glucose and ketone. Body mass and BMR were lowest during breeding, highest during winter and intermediate during spring migration, moult and autumn migration. Despite this variation in energy budgets, the magnitude of the APR, as measured by all variables, was similar in all annual cycle stages. Thus, while we find evidence that some annual cycle stages are relatively more energetically constrained, we find no support for the hypothesis that during these annual cycle stages birds compromise an immune defence that is itself energetically costly. We suggest that the ability to mount an APR may be so essential to survival in every annual cycle stage that skylarks do not trade off this costly form of defence with other annual cycle demands."
https://openalex.org/W2001009576,"Molecular mechanisms of gene regulation underlying the activity-dependent long term changes of cellular electrical properties, such as those during memory, are largely unknown. We have shown that alternative splicing can be dynamically regulated in response to membrane depolarization and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) activation, through special CaM kinase responsive RNA elements. However, proteins that mediate this regulation and how they are affected by CaMKIV are not known. Here we show that the regulation of the stress axis-regulated exon of the Slo1 potassium channel transcripts by membrane depolarization requires a highly conserved CaMKIV target serine (Ser-513) of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L. Ser-513 phosphorylation within the RNA recognition motif 4 enhanced heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L interaction with the CaMKIV-responsive RNA element 1 of stress axis-regulated exon and inhibited binding of the large subunit of the U2 auxiliary factor U2AF65. Both of these activities were abolished by a S513A mutation.

The resulting nuclear extract was used directly for UV cross-linking at a final NaCl concentration of 90–180 mm.

The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl). The resulting proteins were processed as described (17Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T.

One liter of overnight culture of pET28a-hnRNP L plasmid-transformed Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami 2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) was induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C before harvest by centrifugation. The bacteria were then resuspended and sonicated in 4 ml of cold PBS containing 8 m urea and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Invitrogen), incubated at 4 °C for 3 h, and then the beads were washed in 30 ml of cold PBS buffer (containing 6 m urea, 50 mm imidazole) followed by a sequential wash with decreasing concentrations of urea (6 m, 4 m, 2 m, 1 m, and 0 m) in cold PBS. His-hnRNP L was eluted with 1 ml of PBS buffer (containing 1 m imidazole, 1 m KCl, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm DTT) and dialyzed three times against buffer DG (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 80 mm potassium glutamate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PSMF, 1.0 mm DTT). The concentration of hnRNP L was determined by comparing its band intensities with standard BSA proteins in a SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue using scanned images in ImageJ software. Treatment of His-hnRNP L with decreasing concentrations of urea restored about 21% of the UV cross-linking activity of the protein, as indicated by its ability to interact with RNA and inhibit the binding of U2AF65 to the 3′ splice site of STREX (Fig. 4E). Our previous studies indicate that hnRNP L binds CaRRE1 to repress STREX splicing (Fig. 1) but that knockdown of hnRNP L alone did not abolish the depolarization effect (17Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T.

We thus carried out RNA interference against hnRNP L as well as LL proteins by expressing short hairpin RNAs against either hnRNP L (shL), LL (shLL), or both (shL+shLL) in GH3 pituitary cells (Fig. 1D). Each shRNA specifically knocked down its expected target but not the other proteins examined. Knocking down either hnRNP L or LL protein alone promoted (shL) or inhibited (shLL) the STREX exon inclusion in non-treated cells (NT), suggesting that hnRNP L and LL may have differential effect on STREX inclusion in un-depolarized conditions. But neither knockdown abolished the repression effect by depolarization (Fig. 1E). In contrast, knocking down both hnRNP L and LL nearly abolished the depolarization effect (shL+shLL, p = 0.2). Thus, hnRNP L and LL are required for the repression of STREX by depolarization, but either one by itself is sufficient to mediate this effect in GH3 cells. Because our previous work has demonstrated a critical role for the CaMKIV phosphorylation of hnRNP L in its interaction with the CaRRE1 element (17Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T. Kung S.K. Xie J.

To determine how hnRNP L is regulated, we examined its changes upon depolarization. Western blot analysis did not detect changes in its protein level in KCl-treated GH3 cells (data not shown). We found previously that hnRNP L was phosphorylated when coexpressed with a constitutively active CaMKIV(17Yu J. Hai Y. Liu G. Fang T. Kung S.K. Xie J.

However, animal studies showed that paternal obesity may program cardio-metabolic diseases in the offspring. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that paternal BMI may be associated with fetal growth.We analyzed the relationship between paternal body mass index (BMI) and birth weight, ultrasound parameters describing the newborn's body shape as well as parameters describing the newborns endocrine system such as cortisol, aldosterone, renin activity and fetal glycated serum protein in a birth cohort of 899 father/mother/child triplets. Since fetal programming is an offspring sex specific process, male and female offspring were analyzed separately. Multivariable regression analyses considering maternal BMI, paternal and maternal age, hypertension during pregnancy, maternal total glycated serum protein, parity and either gestational age (for birth weight) or time of ultrasound investigation (for ultrasound parameters) as confounding showed that paternal BMI is associated with growth of the male but not female offspring. Paternal BMI correlated with birth parameters of male offspring only: birth weight; biparietal diameter, head circumference; abdominal diameter, abdominal circumference; and pectoral diameter. Cortisol was likewise significantly correlated with paternal BMI in male newborns only.Paternal BMI affects growth of the male but not female offspring. Paternal BMI may thus represent a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases of male offspring in later life. It remains to be demonstrated whether this is linked to an offspring sex specific paternal programming of cortisol secretion."

Therefore the fast production of ribosomal proteins, their efficient delivery to the nucleus and correct incorporation into ribosomal subunits are prerequisites for optimal growth rates. Here, we report that the ankyrin repeat protein Yar1 directly interacts with the small ribosomal subunit protein Rps3 and accompanies newly synthesized Rps3 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where Rps3 is assembled into pre-ribosomal subunits. A yar1 deletion strain displays a similar phenotype as an rps3 mutant strain, showing an accumulation of 20S pre-rRNA and a 40S export defect. The combination of an rps3 mutation with a yar1 deletion leads to an enhancement of these phenotypes, while increased expression of RPS3 suppresses the defects of a yar1 deletion strain. We further show that Yar1 protects Rps3 from aggregation in vitro and increases its solubility in vivo. Our data suggest that Yar1 is a specific chaperone for Rps3, which serves to keep Rps3 soluble until its incorporation into the pre-ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2128116051,"Core histone proteins are essential for packaging the genomic DNA into chromatin in all eukaryotes. Since multiple genes encode these histone proteins, there is potential for generating more histones than what is required for chromatin assembly. The positively charged histones have a very high affinity for negatively charged molecules such as DNA, and any excess of histone proteins results in deleterious effects on genomic stability and cell viability. Hence, histone levels are known to be tightly regulated via transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. We have previously elucidated the posttranslational regulation of histone protein levels by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway involving the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes Ubc4/5 and the HECT (Homologous to E6-AP C-Terminus) domain containing E3 ligase Tom1 in the budding yeast. Here we report the identification of four additional E3 ligases containing the RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domains that are involved in the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of excess histones in yeast. These E3 ligases are Pep5, Snt2 as well as two previously uncharacterized Open Reading Frames (ORFs) YKR017C and YDR266C that we have named Hel1 and Hel2 (for Histone E3 Ligases) respectively. Mutants lacking these E3 ligases are sensitive to histone overexpression as they fail to degrade excess histones and accumulate high levels of endogenous histones on histone chaperones. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that these E3 ligases interact with the major E2 enzyme Ubc4 that is involved in the degradation related ubiquitylation of histones. Using mutagenesis we further demonstrate that the RING domains of Hel1, Hel2 and Snt2 are required for histone regulation. Lastly, mutants corresponding to Hel1, Hel2 and Pep5 are sensitive to replication inhibitors. Overall, our results highlight the importance of posttranslational histone regulatory mechanisms that employ multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases to ensure excess histone degradation and thus contribute to the maintenance of genomic stability."

The present fMRI study used an action-observation paradigm to investigate the contributions of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus and midbrain dopaminergic system to different types of learning: learning in the absence of prediction errors, learning from prediction errors, and responding to the accumulation of prediction errors in unpredictable stimulus configurations. We conducted analyses of the regions of interests' BOLD response towards these different types of learning, implementing a bootstrapping procedure to correct for false positives. We found both, caudate nucleus and the hippocampus to be activated by perceptual prediction errors. The hippocampal responses seemed to relate to the associative mismatch between a stored representation and current sensory input. Moreover, its response was significantly influenced by the average information, or Shannon entropy of the stimulus material. In accordance with earlier results, the habenula was activated by perceptual prediction errors. Lastly, we found that the substantia nigra was activated by the novelty of sensory input. In sum, we established that the midbrain dopaminergic system, the hippocampus, and the caudate nucleus were to different degrees significantly involved in the three different types of learning: acquisition of new information, learning from prediction errors and responding to unpredictable stimulus developments.

https://openalex.org/W1984518551,"Dna2 is an essential helicase/nuclease that is postulated to cleave long DNA flaps that escape FEN1 activity during Okazaki fragment (OF) maturation in yeast. We previously demonstrated that the human Dna2 orthologue (hDna2) localizes to the nucleus and contributes to genomic stability. Here we investigated the role hDna2 plays in DNA replication. We show that Dna2 associates with the replisome protein And-1 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Depletion of hDna2 resulted in S/G(2) phase-specific DNA damage as evidenced by increased γ-H2AX, replication protein A foci, and Chk1 kinase phosphorylation, a readout for activation of the ATR-mediated S phase checkpoint. In addition, we observed reduced origin firing in hDna2-depleted cells consistent with Chk1 activation. We next examined the impact of hDna2 on OF maturation and replication fork progression in human cells. As expected, FEN1 depletion led to a significant reduction in OF maturation. Strikingly, the reduction in OF maturation had no impact on replication fork progression, indicating that fork movement is not tightly coupled to lagging strand maturation. Analysis of hDna2-depleted cells failed to reveal a defect in OF maturation or replication fork progression. Prior work in yeast demonstrated that ectopic expression of FEN1 rescues Dna2 defects. In contrast, we found that FEN1 expression in hDna2-depleted cells failed to rescue genomic instability. These findings suggest that the genomic instability observed in hDna2-depleted cells does not arise from defective OF maturation and that hDna2 plays a role in DNA replication that is distinct from FEN1 and OF maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2096578308,"The single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein from the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans (DrSSB) functions as a homodimer in which each monomer contains two oligonucleotide-binding (OB) domains. This arrangement is exceedingly rare among bacterial SSBs, which typically form homotetramers of single-OB domain subunits. To better understand how this unusual structure influences the DNA binding and biological functions of DrSSB in D. radiodurans radiation resistance, we have examined the structure of DrSSB in complex with ssDNA and the DNA damage-dependent cellular dynamics of DrSSB. The x-ray crystal structure of the DrSSB-ssDNA complex shows that ssDNA binds to surfaces of DrSSB that are analogous to those mapped in homotetrameric SSBs, although there are distinct contacts in DrSSB that mediate species-specific ssDNA binding. Observations by electron microscopy reveal two salt-dependent ssDNA-binding modes for DrSSB that strongly resemble those of the homotetrameric Escherichia coli SSB, further supporting a shared overall DNA binding mechanism between the two classes of bacterial SSBs. In vivo, DrSSB levels are heavily induced following exposure to ionizing radiation. This accumulation is accompanied by dramatic time-dependent DrSSB cellular dynamics in which a single nucleoid-centric focus of DrSSB is observed within 1 h of irradiation but is dispersed by 3 h after irradiation. These kinetics parallel those of D. radiodurans postirradiation genome reconstitution, suggesting that DrSSB dynamics could play important organizational roles in DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1989852558,"Amyloids are aggregated proteins characterized by a specific cross-β-sheet structure and are typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Recently, however, several nonpathological amyloids have been found in intracellular organelles of normal mammalian tissues suggesting that amyloid may also carry out biological functions. We previously have shown that the epididymal cystatin CRES (cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic), cst8, a reproductive-specific member of the cystatin superfamily of cysteine protease inhibitors, forms amyloid in vitro suggesting that CRES amyloid may also form in vivo within the epididymal lumen. Here we show that amyloid structures containing CRES are a component of the normal mouse epididymal lumen without any apparent cytotoxic effects on spermatozoa and that these structures change along the length of the tubule. These studies suggest the presence of a functional amyloid structure that may carry out roles in sperm maturation or maintenance of the luminal milieu and which itself may undergo maturational changes along the epididymis. In contrast to previous examples of functional amyloid which were intracellular, our studies now show that nonpathological/functional amyloid can also be extracellular. The presence of an extracellular and nonpathological amyloid in the epididymis suggests that similar amyloid structures may be present in other organ systems and may carry out distinctive tissue-specific functions."

We report that TRPV1 is N-glycosylated and that N-glycosylation is a major determinant of capsaicin-evoked desensitization and ionic permeability. Both N-glycosylated and unglycosylated TRPV1 was detected in extracts of peripheral sensory nerves by Western blotting. TRPV1 expressed in HEK-293 cells exhibited various degrees of glycosylation.

Capsaicin-evoked increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) were sustained in wild-type TRPV1 HEK-293 cells but were rapidly desensitized in N604T TRPV1 cells. There was marked cell-to-cell variability in capsaicin responses and desensitization between individual cells expressing wild-type TRPV1 but highly uniform responses in cells expressing N604T TRPV1, consistent with variable levels of glycosylation of the wild-type channel. These differences were also apparent when wild-type or N604T TRPV1-GFP fusion proteins were expressed in neurons from trpv1(-/-) mice. Capsaicin evoked a marked, concentration-dependent increase in uptake of the large cationic dye YO-PRO-1 in cells expressing wild-type TRPV1, indicative of loss of ion selectivity, that was completely absent in cells expressing N604T TRPV1. Thus, TRPV1 is variably N-glycosylated and glycosylation is a key determinant of capsaicin regulation of TRPV1 desensitization and permeability. Our findings suggest that physiological or pathological alterations in TRPV1 glycosylation would affect TRPV1 function and pain transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2037770042,"The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is the essential transcription-replication machinery of the influenza virus. It is composed of the trimeric polymerase (PA, PB1 and PB2), nucleoprotein (NP) and RNA. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of RNP assembly is central to our understanding of the control of viral transcription and replication and the dependence of these processes on the host cell. In this report, we show, by RNP reconstitution assays and co-immunoprecipitation, that the interaction between NP and polymerase is crucial for the function of the RNP. The functional association of NP and polymerase involves the C-terminal ‘627’ domain of PB2 and it requires NP arginine-150 and either lysine-627 or arginine-630 of PB2. Using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrate that the interaction between NP and PB2 takes place without the involvement of RNA. At 33, 37 and 41°C in mammalian cells, more positive charges at aa. 627 and 630 of PB2 lead to stronger NP-polymerase interaction, which directly correlates with the higher RNP activity. In conclusion, our study provides new information on the NP-PB2 interaction and shows that the strength of NP-polymerase interaction and the resulting RNP activity are promoted by the positive charges at aa. 627 and 630 of PB2."
https://openalex.org/W2064676368,"The “glutamate” theory of schizophrenia emerged from the observation that phencyclidine (PCP), an open channel antagonist of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor, induces schizophrenia-like behaviors in humans. PCP also induces a complex set of behaviors in animal models of this disorder. PCP also increases glutamate and dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, brain regions associated with expression of psychosis. Increased motor activation is among the PCP-induced behaviors that have been widely validated as models for the characterization of new antipsychotic drugs. The peptide transmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) activates a group II metabotropic receptor, mGluR3. Polymorphisms in this receptor have been associated with schizophrenia. Inhibitors of glutamate carboxypeptidase II, an enzyme that inactivates NAAG following synaptic release, reduce several behaviors induced by PCP in animal models. This research tested the hypothesis that two structurally distinct NAAG peptidase inhibitors, ZJ43 and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentane-1,5-dioic acid, would elevate levels of synaptically released NAAG and reduce PCP-induced increases in glutamate and dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. NAAG-like immunoreactivity was found in neurons and presumptive synaptic endings in both regions. These peptidase inhibitors reduced the motor activation effects of PCP while elevating extracellular NAAG levels. They also blocked PCP-induced increases in glutamate but not dopamine or its metabolites. The mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 blocked these behavioral and neurochemical effects of the peptidase inhibitors. The data reported here provide a foundation for assessment of the neurochemical mechanism through which NAAG achieves its antipsychotic-like behavioral effects and support the conclusion NAAG peptidase inhibitors warrant further study as a novel antipsychotic therapy aimed at mGluR3.

On the day of surgery, rats were anesthetized with ketamine (80 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg) (intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (KOPF Instruments, Tujunga, CA) for surgical implantation of a guide cannula. The guide cannula (SciPro Inc., Sanborn, NY) was positioned to both the mPFC according to the coordinates (AP, +3.2; ML, +0.8; DV, 2.6) and the NAc according to the coordinates (AP, +1.7; ML, −1.0; DV, 6.0) in the same rats (two simultaneous dialysis probes per rat). The guide cannula was secured to the skull with dental cement anchored by two stainless steel screws. After surgery, each rat was individually housed and allowed to recover for at least 24 h before the microdialysis experiment. Microdialysis experiments were carried out on conscious, freely moving rats. On the day of the experiment, rats were lightly anesthetized to facilitate manual insertion of the microdialysis probe into the guide cannula. The stylet in the guide cannula was replaced with the microdialysis probe (outer diameter, 0.6 mm; exposed tip, 3.0 mm for mPFC and 2.0 mm for NAc; cut-off of 6 kDa; SciPro Inc.). Rats were tethered to the awake animal system by means of a plastic collar (CMA Microdialysis AB). The probe was perfused at 2 μl/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (147 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.85 mm MgCl2; CMA Microdialysis AB). All fluid connections were made using FEP tubing (internal volume of 1.2 μl/10 cm; SciPro Inc.). After at least a 2-h equilibration period, dialysate samples were collected every 30 min. Three base-line fractions were collected before ZJ43, 2-PMPA, or saline injection. Pretreatment of ZJ43 (150 mg/kg, i.p.), 2-PMPA (50 mg/kg, i.p.), ZJ43 (150 mg/kg, i.p.) + LY341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), 2-PMPA (50 mg/kg, i.p.) + LY341495 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), or saline occurred 20 min before PCP (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline injection. Samples were subsequently analyzed for either DA or its metabolites (DOPAC and HVA) or glutamate by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and NAAG by radioimmunoassay. Dialysate samples (20 μl) were directly applied to the HPLC column and monitored with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD, Waters). A reversed-phase column (Atlantis T3, ODS, 4.6 × 150 mm, 3 μm; Waters) was used, and the mobile phase for detection of DA and its metabolites consisted of 0.1 m citric acid-sodium acetate, 0.05 mm EDTA, and 65 mg/ml l-octanesulfonic acid with 15% methanol (v/v) in water adjusted to pH 3.8 with 1 m citric acid. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The column temperature was kept at 30 °C, and the applied potential was +750 mV. Reagents used were analytical or HPLC grade. Glutamate was derivatized with o-phthalaldehyde (Sigma), as described by Rowley et al. (43Rowley H.L. Martin K.F. Marsden C.A. Determination of in vivo amino acid neurotransmitters by high performance liquid chromatography with o-phthalaldehyde-sulfite derivatization.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1995; 57: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). o-Phthalaldehyde (2.2 mg) was dissolved in 0.05 ml of absolute ethanol, and then the solution was mixed with 0.9 ml of sodium tetraborate buffer (0.1 m). After that, the 0.05 ml of sodium sulfite (1 m) was added into the solution. Fifteen μl of microdialysate sample was mixed with 3 μl of o-phthalaldehyde solution for 10 min at room temperature before detection of glutamate. After derivatization, glutamate samples (15 μl) were detected by HPLC-ECD. A reversed-phase column (Atlantis T3, ODS, 4.6 × 150 mm, 3 μm; Waters) was used, and the mobile phase for detection of glutamate was composed of 0.1 m citric acid-sodium acetate and 0.05 mm EDTA with 19% methanol (v/v) in water adjusted to pH 3.8 with 1 m citric acid. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The column temperature was kept at 30 °C, and the applied potential was +850 mV. Dialysate samples were analyzed for NAAG content using radioimmunoassay, as described previously (44Fuhrman S. Palkovits M. Cassidy M. Neale J.H. The regional distribution of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and peptidase activity against NAAG in the rat nervous system.J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), with small modifications. Briefly, 20-μl samples were diluted to 50 μl with PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 μl of NAAG antisera (1:25) and 25 μl of [3H]NAAG (50,000 cpm, ∼5 pmol). After incubation, 900 μl of −20 °C methanol was added, and precipitated proteins were separated by sedimentation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Levels of tritium in the pellets and supernatants were measured by liquid scintillation, and [3H]NAAG bound to antibody in unknown samples was compared with that of standards. A standard curve (0.033–3.3 μm NAAG) was performed with each assay. Highly specific NAAG antiserum was produced in rabbits by repeated immunizations with NAAG coupled to thyroglobulin and to colloidal gold particles. This antiserum was highly specific for NAAG versus N-acetylaspartate, glutamate, GABA, and aspartate (44Fuhrman S. Palkovits M. Cassidy M. Neale J.H. The regional distribution of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and peptidase activity against NAAG in the rat nervous system.J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At the completion of each experiment, rats were killed by CO2 inhalation, and brains were removed and fixed in 10% formalin and dehydrated in 30% sucrose solution. After that, coronal sections of 30 μm were cut frozen, and the position of the probe was determined by Nissl's staining. The microdialysis data were analyzed only if the probe was found to be located inside the mPFC or NAc. The rat was placed into a Med Associates (St. Albans, VT) ENV-515 open field chamber (43 × 43 cm, with three 16-beam infrared beams and detectors) to allow microdialysis sampling in the rat brain while simultaneously recording the locomotor activity of the rat. Motor activity was recorded as distance traveled and as ambulatory counts (the number of infrared beam breaks/test interval). Equivalent data were obtained from the two measures. Ambulatory counts are presented in Fig. 8, a and b. Microdialysis data are expressed as a percentage of basal values (calculated as means of the three samples before injections). The basal concentrations in the dialysis were expressed in μm. All data are given as means ± S.E. and not corrected for “recovery” of the dialysis procedure. Rare samples whose values varied by more than 2 S.D. values from the mean were removed from consideration. The general linear model with repeated measurements (SPSS19 for Windows) was used to examine the time-dependent effect of drugs on each neurotransmitter in the two brain regions and behavior with treatment group as a fixed factor and time as the within-subject factor. In case of significant interactions, post hoc comparisons were performed by a Duncan test. The level of significant difference was set at p < 0.05. A one-way analysis of variance with post hoc comparisons was used for every time point analysis. NAAG-specific antisera were prepared and immunohistochemistry performed as described previously (45Moffett J.R. Namboodiri M.A. Neale J.H. Enhanced carbodiimide fixation for immunohistochemistry.

https://openalex.org/W2000226707,"The PTEN/PI3K pathway is commonly mutated in cancer and therefore represents an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. To investigate the primary phenotypes mediated by increased pathway signaling in a clean, patient-relevant context, an activating PIK3CA mutation (H1047R) was knocked-in to an endogenous allele of the MCF10A non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cell line. Introduction of an endogenously mutated PIK3CA allele resulted in a marked epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasive phenotype, compared to isogenic wild-type cells. The invasive phenotype was linked to enhanced PIP3 production via a S6K-IRS positive feedback mechanism. Moreover, potent and selective inhibitors of PI3K were highly effective in reversing this phenotype, which is optimally revealed in 3-dimensional cell culture. In contrast, inhibition of Akt or mTOR exacerbated the invasive phenotype. Our results suggest that invasion is a core phenotype mediated by increased PTEN/PI3K pathway activity and that therapeutic agents targeting different nodes of the PI3K pathway may have dramatic differences in their ability to reverse or promote cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2078054215,"Recent studies provide evidence that high-fat diets (HF) trigger both i) a deficit of reward responses linked to a decrease of mesolimbic dopaminergic activity, and ii) a disorganization of circadian feeding behavior that switch from a structured meal-based schedule to a continuous snacking, even during periods normally devoted to rest. This feeding pattern has been shown to be a cause of HF-induced overweight and obesity. Our hypothesis deals with the eventual link between the rewarding properties of food and the circadian distribution of meals. We have investigated the effect of circadian feeding pattern on reward circuits by means of the conditioned-place preference (CPP) paradigm and we have characterized the rewarding properties of natural (food) and artificial (cocaine) reinforcers both in free-feeding ad libitum HF mice and in HF animals submitted to a re-organized feeding schedule based on the standard feeding behavior displayed by mice feeding normal chow (""forced synchronization""). We demonstrate that i) ad libitum HF diet attenuates cocaine and food reward in the CPP protocol, and ii) forced synchronization of feeding prevents this reward deficit. Our study provides further evidence that the rewarding impact of food with low palatability is diminished in mice exposed to a high-fat diet and strongly suggest that the decreased sensitivity to chow as a positive reinforcer triggers a disorganized feeding pattern which might account for metabolic disorders leading to obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1990303454,"Worldwide, Dickeya (formerly Erwinia chrysanthemi) is causing soft rot diseases on a large diversity of crops and ornamental plants. Strains affecting potato are mainly found in D. dadantii, D. dianthicola and D. zeae, which appear to have a marked geographical distribution. Furthermore, a few Dickeya isolates from potato are attributed to D. chrysanthemi and D. dieffenbachiae. In Europe, isolates of Erwinia chrysanthemi biovar 1 and biovar 7 from potato are now classified in D. dianthicola. However, in the past few years, a new Dickeya biovar 3 variant, tentatively named ‘Dickeya solani’, has emerged as a common major threat, in particular in seed potatoes. Sequences of a fliC gene fragment were used to generate a phylogeny of Dickeya reference strains from culture collections and with this reference backbone, to classify pectinolytic isolates, i.e. Dickeya spp. from potato and ornamental plants. The reference strains of the currently recognized Dickeya species and ‘D. solani’ were unambiguously delineated in the fliC phylogram. D. dadantii, D. dianthicola and ‘D. solani’ displayed unbranched clades, while D. chrysanthemi, D. zeae and D. dieffenbachiae branched into subclades and lineages. Moreover, Dickeya isolates from diagnostic samples, in particular biovar 3 isolates from greenhouse ornamentals, formed several new lineages. Most of these isolates were positioned between the clade of ‘D. solani’ and D. dadantii as transition variants. New lineages also appeared in D. dieffenbachiae and in D. zeae. The strains and isolates of D. dianthicola and ‘D. solani’ were differentiated by a fliC sequence useful for barcode identification. A fliC TaqMan®real-time PCR was developed for ‘D. solani’ and the assay was provisionally evaluated in direct analysis of diagnostic potato samples. This molecular tool can support the efforts to control this particular phytopathogen in seed potato certification."
https://openalex.org/W2053788298,"The exposures to extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) in our environment have dramatically increased. Epidemiological studies suggest that there is a possible association between ELF-MF exposure and increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Animal studies show that ELF-MF exposure may interfere with the activity of brain cells, generate behavioral and cognitive disturbances, and produce deficits in attention, perception and spatial learning. Although, many research efforts have been focused on the interaction between ELF-MF exposure and the central nervous system, the mechanism of interaction is still unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of ELF-MF exposure on learning in mice using two water maze tasks and on some parameters indicative of oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum. We found that ELF-MF exposure (1 mT, 50 Hz) induced serious oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum and impaired hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and striatum-dependent habit learning. This study provides evidence for the association between the impairment of learning and the oxidative stress in hippocampus and striatum induced by ELF-MF exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2095270886,"Odorant receptor (OR) proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when heterologously expressed in cultured cells of non-olfactory origins. RTP1S is an accessory protein to mammalian ORs and facilitates their trafficking to the cell-surface membrane and ligand-induced responses in heterologous cells. The mechanism by which RTP1S promotes the functional expression of ORs remains poorly understood. To obtain a better understanding of the role(s) of RTP1S, we performed a series of structure-function analyses of RTP1S in HEK293T cells. By constructing RTP1S deletion and chimera series and subsequently introducing single-site mutations into the protein, we found the N terminus of RTP1S is important for the endoplasmic reticulum exit of ORs and that a middle region of RTP1S is important for OR trafficking from the Golgi to the membrane. Using sucrose gradient centrifugation, we found that the localization of RTP1S to the lipid raft microdomain is critical to the activation of ORs. Finally, in a protein-protein interaction analysis, we determined that the C terminus of RTP1S may be interacting with ORs. These findings provide new insights into the distinct roles of RTP1S in OR translocation and activation."
https://openalex.org/W2084237778,"The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a first relay of the central auditory system as well as a site for integration of multimodal information. Vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT-1 and VGLUT-2 selectively package glutamate into synaptic vesicles and are found to have different patterns of organization in the DCN. Whereas auditory nerve fibers predominantly co-label with VGLUT-1, somatosensory inputs predominantly co-label with VGLUT-2. Here, we used retrograde and anterograde transport of fluorescent conjugated dextran amine (DA) to demonstrate that the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) exhibits ipsilateral projections to both fusiform and deep layers of the rat DCN. Stimulating the LVN induced glutamatergic synaptic currents in fusiform cells and granule cell interneurones. We combined the dextran amine neuronal tracing method with immunohistochemistry and showed that labeled projections from the LVN are co-labeled with VGLUT-2 by contrast to VGLUT-1. Wistar rats were exposed to a loud single tone (15 kHz, 110 dB SPL) for 6 hours. Five days after acoustic overexposure, the level of expression of VGLUT-1 in the DCN was decreased whereas the level of expression of VGLUT-2 in the DCN was increased including terminals originating from the LVN. VGLUT-2 mediated projections from the LVN to the DCN are likely to play a role in the head position in response to sound. Amplification of VGLUT-2 expression after acoustic overexposure could be a compensatory mechanism from vestibular inputs in response to hearing loss and to a decrease of VGLUT-1 expression from auditory nerve fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2067891202,"The most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation is ΔF508, and this causes cystic fibrosis (CF). New CF models in the pig and ferret have been generated that develop lung, pancreatic, liver, and intestinal pathologies that reflect disease in CF patients. Species-specific biology in the processing of CFTR has demonstrated that pig and mouse ΔF508-CFTR proteins are more effectively processed to the apical membrane of airway epithelia than human ΔF508-CFTR. The processing behavior of ferret WT- and ΔF508-CFTR proteins remains unknown, and such information is important to predicting the utility of a ΔF508-CFTR ferret. To this end, we sought to compare processing, membrane stability, and function of human and ferret WT- and ΔF508-CFTR proteins in a heterologous expression system using HT1080, HEK293T, BHK21, and Cos7 cells as well as human and ferret CF polarized airway epithelia. Analysis of the protein processing and stability by metabolic pulse-chase and surface On-Cell Western blots revealed that WT-fCFTR half-life and membrane stability were increased relative to WT-hCFTR. Furthermore, in BHK21, Cos7, and CuFi cells, human and ferret ΔF508-CFTR processing was negligible, whereas low levels of processing of ΔF508-fCFTR could be seen in HT1080 and HEK293T cells. Only the WT-fCFTR, but not ΔF508-fCFTR, produced functional cAMP-inducible chloride currents in both CF human and ferret airway epithelia. Further elucidation of the mechanism responsible for elevated fCFTR protein stability may lead to new therapeutic approaches to augment CFTR function. These findings also suggest that generation of a ferret CFTR(ΔF508/ΔF508) animal model may be useful."
https://openalex.org/W1512035175,"The Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) contributes to viral replication in non-dividing cells, specifically those of the myeloid lineage. However, the effects of Vpr in enhancing HIV-1 infection in dendritic cells have not been extensively investigated. Here, we evaluated the role of Vpr during infection of highly permissive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD4+ T-cells and compared it to that of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), which are less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Infections of dividing PBMCs and non-dividing MDDCs were carried out with single-cycle and replication-competent HIV-1 encoding intact Vpr or Vpr-defective mutants. In contrast to previous findings, we observed that single-cycle HIV-1 infection of both PBMCs and MDDCs was significantly enhanced in the presence of Vpr when the viral stocks were carefully characterized and titrated. HIV-1 DNA quantification revealed that Vpr only enhanced the reverse transcription and nuclear import processes in single-cycle HIV-1 infected MDDCs, but not in CD4+ T-cells. However, a significant enhancement in HIV-1 gag mRNA expression was observed in both CD4+ T-cells and MDDCs in the presence of Vpr. Furthermore, Vpr complementation into HIV-1 virions did not affect single-cycle viral infection of MDDCs, suggesting that newly synthesized Vpr plays a significant role to facilitate single-cycle HIV-1 infection. Over the course of a spreading infection, Vpr significantly enhanced replication-competent HIV-1 infection in MDDCs, while it modestly promoted viral infection in activated PBMCs. Quantification of viral DNA in replication-competent HIV-1 infected PBMCs and MDDCs revealed similar levels of reverse transcription products, but increased nuclear import in the presence of Vpr independent of the cell types. Taken together, our results suggest that Vpr has differential effects on single-cycle and spreading HIV-1 infections, which are dependent on the permissiveness of the target cell."
https://openalex.org/W2026379229,"Although there is extensive information on gene expression and molecular interactions in various cell types, integrating those data in a functionally coherent manner remains challenging. This study explores the premise that genes whose expression at the mRNA level is correlated over diverse cell lines are likely to function together in a network of molecular interactions. We previously derived expression-correlated gene clusters from the database of the NCI-60 human tumor cell lines and associated each cluster with function categories of the Gene Ontology (GO) database. From a cluster rich in genes associated with GO categories related to cell migration, we extracted 15 genes that were highly cross-correlated; prominent among them were RRAS, AXL, ADAM9, FN14, and integrin-beta1. We then used those 15 genes as bait to identify other correlated genes in the NCI-60 database. A survey of current literature disclosed, not only that many of the expression-correlated genes engaged in molecular interactions related to migration, invasion, and metastasis, but that highly cross-correlated subsets of those genes engaged in specific cell migration processes. We assembled this information in molecular interaction maps (MIMs) that depict networks governing 3 cell migration processes: degradation of extracellular matrix, production of transient focal complexes at the leading edge of the cell, and retraction of the rear part of the cell. Also depicted are interactions controlling the release and effects of calcium ions, which may regulate migration in a spaciotemporal manner in the cell. The MIMs and associated text comprise a detailed and integrated summary of what is currently known or surmised about the role of the expression cross-correlated genes in molecular networks governing those processes."
https://openalex.org/W2032265040,"Serum half-life of IgG is controlled by the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) that interacts with the IgG Fc region and may be increased or decreased as a function of altered FcRn binding. Preclinical evaluations of modified IgGs are frequently carried out in mice, but such IgGs may bind differently to mouse and human FcRn (mFcRn and hFcRn). Here, we report a detailed characterization of a matched set of mouse-human chimeric T84.66 scFv-Fc variants with specificity for the tumor carcinoembryonic antigen and mutations in the FcRn-binding site. Binding to soluble mFcRn and hFcRn was measured using in vitro assays, and the results were compared with blood clearance in vivo in normal (mFcRn bearing) and hFcRn transgenic mice. All variants bound better to mFcRn than to hFcRn. The loss of affinity varied among the mutants, however, and also the hierarchy of binding differed depending on the receptor. The mutations had no major impact on binding to the classical Fcγ receptors. Importantly, the trend of blood clearance in both strains of mice correlated with the hierarchy of binding obtained using soluble FcRn. Consequently, in vitro interaction analysis of engineered IgGs regarding their cross-species FcRn binding ability provides information for prediction of in vivo pharmacokinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2067601949,"We describe an external quality assurance (EQA) study designed to assess the efficiency and accurateness of molecular and serological methods used by expert laboratories performing YF diagnosis.For molecular diagnosis evaluation, a panel was prepared of 14 human plasma samples containing specific RNA of different YFV strains (YFV-17D, YFV South American strain [Brazil], YFV IvoryC1999 strain), and specificity samples containing other flaviviruses and negative controls. For the serological panel, 13 human plasma samples with anti-YFV-specific antibodies against different strains of YFV (YFV-17D strain, YFV IvoryC1999 strain, and YFV Brazilian strain), as well as specificity and negative controls, were included.Thirty-six laboratories from Europe, the Americas, Middle East, and Africa participated in these EQA activities. Only 16% of the analyses reported met all evaluation criteria with optimal performance. Serial dilutions of YFV-17D showed that in general the methodologies reported provided a suitable sensitivity. Failures were mainly due to the inability to detect wild-type strains or the presence of false positives. Performance in the serological diagnosis varied, mainly depending on the methodology used. Anti-YFV IgM detection was not performed in 16% of the reports using IIF or ELISA techniques, although it is preferable for the diagnosis of YFV acute infections. A good sensitivity profile was achieved in general; however, in the detection of IgM antibodies a lack of sensitivity of anti-YFV antibodies against the vaccine strain 17D was observed, and of the anti-YFV IgG antibodies against a West African strain. Neutralization assays showed a very good performance; however, the unexpected presence of false positives underlined the need of improving the running protocols.This EQA provides information on each laboratory's efficacy of RT-PCR and serological YFV diagnosis techniques. The results indicate the need for improving serological and molecular diagnosis techniques and provide a follow-up of the diagnostic profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2089358798,"Mutations in, or elevated dosage of, SNCA, the gene for α-synuclein (α-syn), cause familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Mouse lines overexpressing the mutant human A53Tα-syn may represent a model of early PD. They display progressive motor deficits, abnormal cellular accumulation of α-syn, and deficits in dopamine-dependent corticostriatal plasticity, which, in the absence of overt nigrostriatal degeneration, suggest there are age-related deficits in striatal dopamine (DA) signalling. In addition A53Tα-syn overexpression in cultured rodent neurons has been reported to inhibit transmitter release. Therefore here we have characterized for the first time DA release in the striatum of mice overexpressing human A53Tα-syn, and explored whether A53Tα-syn overexpression causes deficits in the release of DA. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to detect DA release at carbon-fibre microelectrodes in acute striatal slices from two different lines of A53Tα-syn-overexpressing mice, at up to 24 months. In A53Tα-syn overexpressors, mean DA release evoked by a single stimulus pulse was not different from wild-types, in either dorsal striatum or nucleus accumbens. However the frequency responsiveness of DA release was slightly modified in A53Tα-syn overexpressors, and in particular showed slight deficiency when the confounding effects of striatal ACh acting at presynaptic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) were antagonized. The re-release of DA was unmodified after single-pulse stimuli, but after prolonged stimulation trains, A53Tα-syn overexpressors showed enhanced recovery of DA release at old age, in keeping with elevated striatal DA content. In summary, A53Tα-syn overexpression in mice causes subtle changes in the regulation of DA release in the striatum. While modest, these modifications may indicate or contribute to striatal dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1968448657,"Although reaction time is commonly used as an indicator of central nervous system integrity, little is currently understood about the mechanisms that determine processing time. In the current study, we are interested in determining the differences in electrophysiological events associated with significant changes in reaction time that could be elicited by changes in stimulus intensity. The primary objective is to assess the effect of increasing stimulus intensity on the latency and amplitude of afferent inputs to the somatosensory cortex, and their relation to reaction time.Median nerve stimulation was applied to the non-dominant hand of 12 healthy young adults at two different stimulus intensities (HIGH & LOW). Participants were asked to either press a button as fast as possible with their dominant hand or remain quiet following the stimulus. Electroencephalography was used to measure somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and event related potentials (ERPs). Electromyography from the flexor digitorum superficialis of the button-pressing hand was used to assess reaction time. Response time was the time of button press.Reaction time and response time were significantly shorter following the HIGH intensity stimulus compared to the LOW intensity stimulus. There were no differences in SEP (N20 & P24) peak latencies and peak-to-peak amplitude for the two stimulus intensities. ERPs, locked to response time, demonstrated a significantly larger pre-movement negativity to positivity following the HIGH intensity stimulus over the Cz electrode.This work demonstrates that rapid reaction times are not attributable to the latency of afferent processing from the stimulated site to the somatosensory cortex, and those latency reductions occur further along the sensorimotor transformation pathway. Evidence from ERPs indicates that frontal planning areas such as the supplementary motor area may play a role in transforming the elevated sensory volley from the somatosensory cortex into a more rapid motor response."

However, mammalian PREs have been elusive until two groups reported putative mammalian PREs recently. Consistent with the existence of mammalian PREs, here we report the identification and characterization of a potential PRE from human T cells. The putative human PRE has enriched binding of PcG proteins, and such binding is dependent on a key PcG component SUZ12. We demonstrate that the putative human PRE carries both genetic and molecular features of Drosophila PRE in transgenic flies, implying that not only the trans PcG proteins but also certain features of the cis PREs are conserved between mammals and Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2029723429,"In the adult mammalian auditory epithelium, the organ of Corti, loss of sensory hair cells results in permanent hearing loss. The underlying cause for the lack of regenerative response is the depletion of otic progenitors in the cell pool of the sensory epithelium. Here, we show that an increase in the sequence-specific methylation of the otic Sox2 enhancers NOP1 and NOP2 is correlated with a reduced self-renewal potential in vivo and in vitro; additionally, the degree of methylation of NOP1 and NOP2 is correlated with the dedifferentiation potential of postmitotic supporting cells into otic stem cells. Thus, the stemness the organ of Corti is related to the epigenetic status of the otic Sox2 enhancers. These observations validate the continued exploration of treatment strategies for dedifferentiating or reprogramming of differentiated supporting cells into progenitors to regenerate the damaged organ of Corti."
https://openalex.org/W2022411004,"Many organisms produce offspring with sex-ratios that deviate from equal numbers of males and females, and numerous adaptive explanations have been proposed. In some species, offspring sex-ratio varies across the reproductive season, again with several explanations as to why this might be adaptive. However, patterns for birds and mammals are inconsistent, and multiple factors are likely involved. Long-term studies on a variety of species may help untangle the complexity. I analyzed a long-term data set on the variation in offspring sex-ratio of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, a temperate-zone, insectivorous species. Sex ratio varied seasonally, but only in some years. Births early in the season were significantly female biased in years in which parturition occurred relatively early, but not in years with late parturition. Survival of female pups increased with earlier median birth date for the colony, and early-born females were more likely to survive and reproduce as one-year olds, compared to later-born pups. I argue that, due to the unusual timing of reproductive activities in male and female bats that hibernate, producing female offspring early in the year increases their probability of reproducing as one year olds, but this is not the case for male offspring. Thus, mothers that can give birth early in the year, benefit most by producing a female pup. The relative benefit of producing female or male offspring varies depending on the length of the growing season and thus the time available for female pups to reach sexual maturity. This suggests that not only does sex-ratio vary seasonally and among years, depending on the condition of the mother and the environment, but also likely varies geographically due to differences in season length."
https://openalex.org/W2000468141,"Most patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) respond well to standard chemotherapy-based treatments. However a significant proportion of patients, particularly adult patients, relapse with the majority dying of leukemia. FTY720 is an immunosuppressive drug that was recently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is currently under pre-clinical investigation as a therapy for a number of hematological malignancies. Using human ALL xenografts in NOD/SCIDγc−/− mice, we show for the first time that three Ph+ human ALL xenografts responded to FTY720 with an 80±12% (p = 0.048) reduction in overall disease when treatment was commenced early. In contrast, treatment of mice with FTY720 did not result in reduced leukemia compared to controls using four separate human Ph− ALL xenografts. Although FTY720 reactivated PP2A in vitro, this reactivation was not required for death of Ph− ALL cells. The plasma levels of FTY720 achieved in the mice were in the high nanomolar range. However, the response seen in the Ph+ ALL xenografts when treatment was initiated early implies that in vivo efficacy may be obtained with substantially lower drug concentrations than those required in vitro. Our data suggest that while FTY720 may have potential as a treatment for Ph+ ALL it will not be a useful agent for the treatment of Ph− B-ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2046675213,"Network inference deals with the reconstruction of biological networks from experimental data. A variety of different reverse engineering techniques are available; they differ in the underlying assumptions and mathematical models used. One common problem for all approaches stems from the complexity of the task, due to the combinatorial explosion of different network topologies for increasing network size. To handle this problem, constraints are frequently used, for example on the node degree, number of edges, or constraints on regulation functions between network components. We propose to exploit topological considerations in the inference of gene regulatory networks. Such systems are often controlled by a small number of hub genes, while most other genes have only limited influence on the network's dynamic. We model gene regulation using a Bayesian network with discrete, Boolean nodes. A hierarchical prior is employed to identify hub genes. The first layer of the prior is used to regularize weights on edges emanating from one specific node. A second prior on hyperparameters controls the magnitude of the former regularization for different nodes. The net effect is that central nodes tend to form in reconstructed networks. Network reconstruction is then performed by maximization of or sampling from the posterior distribution. We evaluate our approach on simulated and real experimental data, indicating that we can reconstruct main regulatory interactions from the data. We furthermore compare our approach to other state-of-the art methods, showing superior performance in identifying hubs. Using a large publicly available dataset of over 800 cell cycle regulated genes, we are able to identify several main hub genes. Our method may thus provide a valuable tool to identify interesting candidate genes for further study. Furthermore, the approach presented may stimulate further developments in regularization methods for network reconstruction from data."
https://openalex.org/W2018140672,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked disorder characterized by loss of dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein that connects the actin cytoskeleton in skeletal muscle cells to extracellular matrix. Dystrophin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane glycoprotein β-dystroglycan (β-DG), which associates with cell surface α-dystroglycan (α-DG) that binds laminin in the extracellular matrix. β-DG can also associate with utrophin, and this differential association correlates with specific glycosylation changes on α-DG. Genetic modification of α-DG glycosylation can promote utrophin binding and rescue dystrophic phenotypes in mouse dystrophy models. We used high throughput screening with the plant lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) to identify compounds that altered muscle cell surface glycosylation, with the goal of finding compounds that increase abundance of α-DG and associated sarcolemmal glycoproteins, increase utrophin usage, and increase laminin binding. We identified one compound, lobeline, from the Prestwick library of Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds that fulfilled these criteria, increasing WFA binding to C2C12 cells and to primary muscle cells from wild type and mdx mice. WFA binding and enhancement by lobeline required complex N-glycans but not O-mannose glycans that bind laminin. However, inhibiting complex N-glycan processing reduced laminin binding to muscle cell glycoproteins, although O-mannosylation was intact. Glycan analysis demonstrated a general increase in N-glycans on lobeline-treated cells rather than specific alterations in cell surface glycosylation, consistent with increased abundance of multiple sarcolemmal glycoproteins. This demonstrates the feasibility of high throughput screening with plant lectins to identify compounds that alter muscle cell glycosylation and identifies a novel role for N-glycans in regulating muscle cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2008794157,"Nbp2p is an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing yeast protein that is involved in a variety of cellular processes. This small adaptor protein binds to a number of different proteins through its SH3 domain, and a region N-terminal to the SH3 domain binds to the protein phosphatase, Ptc1p. Despite its involvement in a large number of physical and genetic interactions, the only well characterized function of Nbp2p is to recruit Ptc1p to the high osmolarity glycerol pathway, which results in down-regulation of this pathway. In this study, we have discovered that Nbp2p orthologues exist in all Ascomycete and Basidiomycete fungal genomes and that all possess an SH3 domain and a conserved novel Ptc1p binding motif. The ubiquitous occurrence of these two features, which we have shown are both critical for Nbp2p function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, implies that a conserved role of Nbp2p in all of these fungal species is the targeting of Ptc1p to proteins recognized by the SH3 domain. We also show that in a manner analogous to its role in the high osmolarity glycerol pathway, Nbp2p functions in the down-regulation of the cell wall integrity pathway through SH3 domain-mediated interaction with Bck1p, a component kinase of this pathway. Based on functional studies on the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Neurospora crassa Nbp2p orthologues and the high conservation of the Nbp2p binding site in Bck1p orthologues, this function of Nbp2p appears to be conserved across Ascomycetes. Our results also clearly imply a function for the Nbp2p-Ptc1p complex other cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W1988712359,"Background The chromosomal translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23) is associated with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia of infants. The resulting AF4•MLL oncoprotein becomes activated by Taspase1 hydrolysis and is considered to promote oncogenic transcriptional activation. Hence, Taspase1’s proteolytic activity is a critical step in AF4•MLL pathophysiology. The Taspase1 proenzyme is autoproteolytically processed in its subunits and is assumed to assemble into an αββα-heterodimer, the active protease. Therefore, we investigated here whether overexpression of catalytically inactive Taspase1 variants are able to interfere with the proteolytic activity of the wild type enzyme in AF4•MLL model systems. Methodology/Findings The consequences of overexpressing the catalytically dead Taspase1 mutant, Taspase1T234V, or the highly attenuated variant, Taspase1D233A, on Taspase1’s processing of AF4•MLL and of other Taspase1 targets was analyzed in living cancer cells employing an optimized cell-based assay. Notably, even a nine-fold overexpression of the respective Taspase1 mutants neither inhibited Taspase1’s cis- nor trans-cleavage activity in vivo. Likewise, enforced expression of the α- or β-subunits showed no trans-dominant effect against the ectopically or endogenously expressed enzyme. Notably, co-expression of the individual α- and β-subunits did not result in their assembly into an enzymatically active protease complex. Probing Taspase1 multimerization in living cells by a translocation-based protein interaction assay as well as by biochemical methods indicated that the inactive Taspase1 failed to assemble into stable heterocomplexes with the wild type enzyme. Conclusions Collectively, our results demonstrate that inefficient heterodimerization appears to be the mechanism by which inactive Taspase1 variants fail to inhibit wild type Taspase1’s activity in trans. Our work favours strategies targeting Taspase1’s catalytic activity rather than attempts to block the formation of active Taspase1 dimers to interfere with the pathobiological function of AF4•MLL."

Currently, the role of the additional alanines on the aggregation behavior of PABPN1 is controversially discussed. We have shown earlier that the purified N-terminal domain (residues 1–125) of PABPN1 forms fibrils with typical amyloid-like characteristics (21Scheuermann T. Schulz B. Blume A. Wahle E. Rudolph R. Schwarz E.

The presence of the polyalanine sequence was absolutely necessary for the conversion of the soluble domain into fibrillar aggregates (21Scheuermann T. Schulz B. Blume A. Wahle E. Rudolph R. Schwarz E. Trinucleotide expansions leading to an extended poly-l-alanine segment in the poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 cause fibril formation.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Lodderstedt G.

On the other hand, in vivo studies pointed toward a polyalanine-independent aggregation/assembly of PABPN1 (23Tavanez J.P. Calado P. Braga J. Lafarga M. Carmo-Fonseca M. In vivo aggregation properties of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1.RNA. 2005; 11: 752-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fact that several oligomerization sites have been identified by independent approaches implicates a high propensity of PABPN1 to form oligomers and/or aggregates: (i) based on the crystal structure of the RNA binding domain, dimerization of the domain has been postulated (24Ge H. Zhou D. Tong S. Gao Y. Teng M. Niu L. Crystal structure and possible dimerization of the single RRM of human PABPN1.Proteins. 2008; 71: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This assumption has been confirmed by the solution structure of the corresponding domain from Xenopus laevis (25Song J. McGivern J.V. Nichols K.W. Markley J.L. Sheets M.D. Structural basis for RNA recognition by a type II poly(A)-binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 15317-15322Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). (ii) Two potential oligomerization sites have been detected via a yeast-two hybrid analysis to search for self-association of PABPN1 fragments. The oligomerization sites have been mapped to amino acids 155–294 and 264–306 (26Fan X. Dion P. Laganiere J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Oligomerization of polyalanine-expanded PABPN1 facilitates nuclear protein aggregation that is associated with cell death.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To what extent the oligomerization segments contribute to OPMD pathogenesis is still an unresolved question. It is neither clear whether the aggregates found via in vivo approaches represent typical amyloid-like structures or whether the deposits consist of amorphous aggregates containing either native or denatured protein. Despite these uncertainties, evidence for an intrinsic toxicity of overexpressed PABPN1 has been obtained by a Drosophila model for OPMD (27Chartier A. Benoit B. Simonelig M. A Drosophila model of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy reveals intrinsic toxicity of PABPN1.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2253-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To examine the role of PABPN1 conformation and oligomerization in the development of OPMD, a biophysical characterization of full-length and truncated versions of PABPN1 was performed. We show here that in contrast to our findings with the N-terminal domain, fibril formation of full-length PABPN1 takes place independently of the presence of the alanine segment. Rather, evidence has been obtained that the C-terminal 49 amino acids are required for fibril formation. The biophysical characterization presented here shows that fibrils of full-length PABPN1 have completely different properties from those of the N-terminal domain. Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) served as host cells. To avoid codon usage problems, either cells contained plasmid pUBS520 (28Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. High-level expression of recombinant genes in Escherichia coli is dependent on the availability of the dnaY gene product.Gene. 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) in the case of full-length PABPN1, or CodonPlus RP (Stratagene) cells were used for the truncated variants. Recombinant cDNA of full-length PABPN1 variants was in vector pET11a (Novagen). Coding fragments for truncated PABPN1 variants were amplified from this vector and ligated into pET SUMOadapt (29Bosse-Doenecke E. Weininger U. Gopalswamy M. Balbach J. Knudsen S.M. Rudolph R.

The cultivation temperature was reduced to 30 °C to prevent inclusion body formation. Purification of full-length PABPN1 was performed essentially according to a published protocol (31Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. Purification of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor involved in the 3′-processing of messenger RNA precursors.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); elution of PABPN1 variants from Blue-Sepharose was achieved by a step gradient with 1 m l-arginine. Truncated PABPN1 variants were expressed as fusions with N-terminal His-SUMO which allowed purification via HisTrap FF crude (GE Healthcare) (5 ml). Fusion proteins were eluted by linear gradients from 20 to 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The His-SUMO fusion was hydrolyzed overnight at 4 °C using SUMO protease (0.05% (v/v) of 0.5 mg/ml protease) followed by dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol to obtain untagged protein (32Mossessova E.

A homogeneous protein species was obtained by anion exchange chromatography using a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP (GE Healthcare). Elution was achieved by a linear gradient from 150 to 500 mm KCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA. Conformational homogeneity of purified protein was confirmed by a symmetric elution peak of the last chromatography step (supplemental Fig. S1). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured at a protein concentration of 4.5 μm. Fluorescence was recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, at 20 °C with a Jobin Yvon Spex Fluoromax 2. Samples were excited at 295 nm and at a bandwidth of 5 nm. Spectra were accumulated five times by using a 1-nm data pitch and an integration time of 0.2 s. Fibril formation was followed by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Protein variants were incubated at a concentration of 60 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, at 20 °C. Samples were briefly mixed and then diluted to final concentrations of 2 μm with 50 μm ThT in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol. ThT fluorescence was recorded at 482 nm with a bandwidth of 8 nm at 20 °C and upon excitation at 450 nm. Samples were measured in 1-cm cuvettes, and signals were accumulated two times. Prior to fibrillation experiments, samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 105,000 × g (TLX 100.4; Beckman Coulter) and samples were analyzed by UV spectroscopy to exclude the presence of aggregated or fibrillar species. Fibrillar fractions were isolated from the soluble species via ultracentrifugation (OptimaTM TLX ultracentrifuge) at 50,000 rpm for 1 h. The pellet was incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol containing different amounts of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). For concentrations above 2.5 m GdmCl, 150 mm KCl was used to avoid solubility limits. After incubation for 1 h at 20 °C, solubilized protein was separated from the insoluble fraction by ultracentrifugation (105,000 × g, 1 h). For determination of the protein concentration, the insoluble fraction was solubilized in 6 m GdmCl, and the protein concentration was measured by UV absorption (ϵ280 nm of full-length variants 20,400 m−1cm−1). A typical UV spectrum of PABPN1 variants is shown in supplemental Fig. S2). Soluble or fibrillar protein was incubated at room temperature with either trypsin or proteinase K at a mass ratio of 1:600 and 1:1000 (protease:protein) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol. Proteolysis was stopped with either a 5-fold molar excess of aprotinin or PMSF. Analysis of proteolysis products was performed by SDS-PAGE with 14% polyacrylamide gels. For characterization of protease-resistant fragments, limited proteolysis was stopped after 2 h. Subsequently, insoluble fractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation (OptimaTM TLX ultracentrifuge) at 105,000 × g for 1 h. Two washing steps with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol were included to remove soluble protein species completely. Insoluble protein was recovered by ultracentrifugation. Finally, the insoluble fractions were dissolved in 6 m GdmCl and loaded on a Jupiter 5 μ C18 300 A (250 × 4.6) HPLC column (Phenomenex). As mobile phase, bidestilled water, 0.1% TFA was used. Protein was eluted from the column by applying a linear gradient up to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA. Elution profiles were recorded monitoring the absorption of peptide bonds at 215 nm and aromatic amino acids at 280 nm. Filter binding assays were carried out as described (4Wahle E. Lustig A.

For the determination of apparent dissociation constants, KD, 8.8 fmol of 32P-labeled oligo(A)-RNA was incubated with increasing concentrations of PABPN1 variants (0–200 nm) in 40 μl of RNA-binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol). After 10 min at room temperature, 35 μl of each reaction was applied to nitrocellulose filters (NC 20, 0.2 μm Whatman) which had been preincubated in washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 5 μg/ml rRNA (Roche Applied Science). After rinsing the filters with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer, filter-bound RNA was quantified via scintillation counting. For analysis of fibril formation via size exclusion chromatography, 100-μl aliquots of the fibrillation samples were loaded on a SuperdexTM 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) (25 ml). To ensure an appropriate evaluation of the data, 5 μl of a l-tryptophan standard (0.3 mm) was added to the samples prior the injection. Size exclusion chromatography was performed with an ÄKTApurifier system (GE Healthcare) following elution via absorption at 280 nm. After the runs, chromatograms were normalized to the absorption of the tryptophan standard at an elution volume of 27 ml. As running buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol was used. Samples for electron microscopy analysis were prepared as published (22Lodderstedt G. Hess S. Hause G. Scheuermann T. Scheibel T. Schwarz E.

Infrared spectra were recorded at a Trensor 27 Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectrometer equipped with a BIO-ATR II cell and a nitrogen-cooled LN-MCT detector. For measurements, 20-μl samples (protein concentration 2–4 mg/ml) were applied on the cells. Spectra were accumulated 64 times at a resolution of 2 cm−1 and 4-fold zero filling. Previous work from our laboratory had shown that fibril formation of the N-terminal domain of PABPN1 strictly requires the presence of the alanine segment (21Scheuermann T. Schulz B. Blume A. Wahle E. Rudolph R. Schwarz E. Trinucleotide expansions leading to an extended poly-l-alanine segment in the poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 cause fibril formation.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At that time, studies of fibril formation with the full-length protein had not been possible due to the high tendency of PABPN1 to form amorphous aggregates. Here, we resumed the original objective to explore the influence of alanine expansions on the conversion of full-length PABPN1 into fibrillar structures. As in the previous experiments, three variants of PABPN1 which differed in their alanine segments were studied: wild-type protein, WT-PABPN1, with the natural 10 alanine residues; an OPMD-related PABPN1 variant with the most extreme expansion of seven additional alanines, (+7)Ala-PABPN1; and a deletion variant in which the alanine sequence had been deleted, ΔAla-PABPN1 (Fig. 1). Due to the tendency of the protein to aggregate, conditions had to be found which prevented amorphous aggregation and allowed fibril formation studies in vitro. In the presence of 1.5 m KCl, formation of amorphous aggregates could be suppressed. High salt concentrations possibly compensate electrostatic interactions of the oppositely charged N- and C-terminal domains (pI of N-terminal residues 1–114: 4.0; pI of C-terminal residues 257–306: 11.8). The native structure and biological activity of the purified protein were confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and oligo(A)-RNA binding (see FIGURE 3, FIGURE 7 and supplemental Figs. S3–S5).FIGURE 7RNA binding assay of fibrillar full-length PABPN1. Filter binding assays were performed with radioactive oligo(A)-RNA to determine the apparent dissociation constants (KD) of fibrillar PABPN1 variants: WT-PABPN1 (black circles), ΔAla-PABPN1 (open circles), and (+7)Ala-PABPN1 (gray circles). For comparison, monomeric WT-PABPN1 (black squares) is shown. Data points were fitted according to Ref. 4Wahle E. Lustig A. Jenö P. Maurer P.

In addition, the absence of aggregated species was controlled by UV spectroscopy (supplemental Fig. S2). Subsequently, fibril formation was tested by ThT fluorescence measurements. In contrast to the N-terminal domains of PABPN1 which in the presence of the N-terminal alanines formed fibrils after a lag phase of approximately 15 days (21Scheuermann T. Schulz B. Blume A. Wahle E. Rudolph R. Schwarz E. Trinucleotide expansions leading to an extended poly-l-alanine segment in the poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 cause fibril formation.Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2685-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), full-length wild-type and (+7)Ala-PABPN1 fibrillized immediately without apparent lag phases (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, also the ΔAla-PABPN1 variant gave rise to increased ThT signals which indicated the existence of fibrils. Kinetics of fibril formation of full-length PABPN1 revealed hyperbolic curve shapes which are untypical for the formation of amyloid-like fibrils. However, electron microscopy confirmed the presence of fibrillar structures (Fig. 2B). No difference in the morphologies among the variants could be detected. The kinetics of fibril formation at early time points was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S6). A time-dependent increase of a peak that corresponded to oligomeric assemblies (>600 kDa) was observed. As with time-dependent ThT fluorescence recordings, also this approach did not show any differences in fibril formation kinetics among the three variants. The atypical fibril format"
https://openalex.org/W2170536105,"Several studies have suggested that autophagy might play a deleterious role in acute pancreatitis via intra-acinar activation of digestive enzymes. The prototype for this phenomenon is cathepsin B-mediated trypsin generation. To determine the organellar basis of this process, we investigated the subcellular distribution of the cathepsin B precursor, procathepsin B. We found that procathepsin B is enriched in Golgi-containing microsomes, suggesting a role for the ADP-ribosylation (ARF)-dependent trafficking of cathepsin B. Indeed, caerulein treatment increased processing of procathepsin B, whereas a known ARF inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) prevented this. Similar treatment did not affect processing of procathepsin L. BFA-mediated ARF1 inhibition resulted in reduced cathepsin B activity and consequently reduced trypsinogen activation. However, formation of light chain 3 (LC3-II) was not affected, suggesting that BFA did not prevent autophagy induction. Instead, sucrose density gradient centrifugation and electron microscopy showed that BFA arrested caerulein-induced autophagosomal maturation. Therefore, ARF1-dependent trafficking of procathepsin B and the maturation of autophagosomes results in cathepsin B-mediated trypsinogen activation induced by caerulein."
https://openalex.org/W2051289234,"Muscle potentially represents the most abundant source of autoantigens of the body and can be targeted by a variety of severe autoimmune diseases. Yet, the mechanisms of immunological tolerance toward muscle autoantigens remain mostly unknown. We investigated this issue in transgenic SM-Ova mice that express an ovalbumin (Ova) neo-autoantigen specifically in skeletal muscle. We previously reported that antigen specific CD4+ T cell are immunologically ignorant to endogenous Ova in this model but can be stimulated upon immunization. In contrast, Ova-specific CD8+ T cells were suspected to be either unresponsive to Ova challenge or functionally defective. We now extend our investigations on the mechanisms governing CD8+ tolerance in SM-Ova mice. We show herein that Ova-specific CD8+ T cells are not detected upon challenge with strongly immunogenic Ova vaccines even after depletion of regulatory T cells. Ova-specific CD8+ T cells from OT-I mice adoptively transferred to SM-Ova mice started to proliferate in vivo, acquired CD69 and PD-1 but subsequently down-regulated Bcl-2 and disappeared from the periphery, suggesting a mechanism of peripheral deletion. Peripheral deletion of endogenous Ova-specific cells was formally demonstrated in chimeric SM-Ova mice engrafted with bone marrow cells containing T cell precursors from OT-I TCR-transgenic mice. Thus, the present findings demonstrate that immunological tolerance to muscle autoantigens involves peripheral deletion of autoreactive CD8+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011837768,"Integrating non-viral vectors based on transposable elements are widely used for genetically engineering mammalian cells in functional genomics and therapeutic gene transfer. For the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase system it was demonstrated that convergent transcription driven by the SB transposase inverted repeats (IRs) in eukaryotic cells occurs after somatic integration. This could lead to formation of double-stranded RNAs potentially presenting targets for the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and subsequently resulting into silencing of the transgene. Therefore, we aimed at investigating transgene expression upon transposition under RNA interference knockdown conditions.To establish RNAi knockdown cell lines we took advantage of the P19 protein, which is derived from the tomato bushy stunt virus. P19 binds and inhibits 21 nucleotides long, small-interfering RNAs and was shown to sufficiently suppress RNAi. We found that transgene expression upon SB mediated transposition was enhanced, resulting into a 3.2-fold increased amount of colony forming units (CFU) after transposition. In contrast, if the transgene cassette is insulated from the influence of chromosomal position effects by the chicken-derived cHS4 insulating sequences or when applying the Forg Prince transposon system, that displays only negligible transcriptional activity, similar numbers of CFUs were obtained.In summary, we provide evidence for the first time that after somatic integration transposon derived transgene expression is regulated by the endogenous RNAi machinery. In the future this finding will help to further improve the molecular design of the SB transposase vector system."
https://openalex.org/W2004617051,"The ribosomal P proteins are located on the stalk of the ribosomal large subunit and play a critical role during the elongation step of protein synthesis. The single chain recombinant antibody C5 (scFv C5) directed against the C-terminal region of the Trypanosoma cruzi P2β protein (TcP2β) recognizes the conserved C-terminal end of all T. cruzi ribosomal P proteins. Although this region is highly conserved among different species, surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that the scFv C5 possesses very low affinity for the corresponding mammalian epitope, despite having only one single amino-acid change. Crystallographic analysis, in silico modelization and NMR assays support the analysis, increasing our understanding on the structural basis of epitope specificity. In vitro protein synthesis experiments showed that scFv C5 was able to specifically block translation by T. cruzi and Crithidia fasciculata ribosomes, but virtually had no effect on Rattus norvegicus ribosomes. Therefore, we used the scFv C5 coding sequence to make inducible intrabodies in Trypanosoma brucei. Transgenic parasites showed a strong decrease in their growth rate after induction. These results strengthen the importance of the P protein C terminal regions for ribosomal translation activity and suggest that trypanosomatid ribosomal P proteins could be a possible target for selective therapeutic agents that could be derived from structural analysis of the scFv C5 antibody paratope."

Marinus M.G. Dam methylation: coordinating cellular processes.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Immediately after replication, only the parental strand is methylated, which guides the mismatch repair system; these hemimethylated GATC sites are the substrate of Dam. Although nearly all of the 20,000 GATC sites in E. coli are involved in mismatch repair, ∼0.1% of these are excluded from this process (8Ringquist S. Smith C.L. The Escherichia coli chromosome contains specific, unmethylated dam dcm sites.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and can be heritably unmethylated. However, these sites can be methylated upon differing environmental conditions (9Tavazoie S.

The methylation state of a subset of these GATC sites epigenetically regulates gene transcription (Fig. 1) such as the pap (10Hernday A.D. Braaten B.A. Low D.A.

GATC sites known and postulated to be involved in gene regulation are highly clustered (supplemental Fig. 1, supplemental Table 1) and have unique flanking sequences in comparison with the majority of genomic GATC sites (6Casadesús J. Low D. Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 830-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Some sites have a conserved A-tract 5′ to the GATC site, which affects the methylation rate and the intersite processive methylation of the enzyme (12Coffin S.R. Reich N.O.

GATC flanking sequences regulate Dam activity: evidence for how Dam specificity may influence pap expression.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An A-tract is referred to as a nonpreferred flank, whereas most non-AT-rich flanks are referred to as preferred. Intersite processivity refers to the ability of an enzyme to modify two or more sites without dissociating. Other sites have AT-rich flanks, which have modestly lowered methylation rates, and most have A-tracts near and around the GATC sites. It appears as if these transiently unmethylated GATC sites are in similar DNA contexts, in the small minority of regulatory sites in the E. coli genome, distinguishable from the majority of other GATC sites. Upon more robust classifications, these sites may form a set of “molecular rules” (14van der Woude M.W. Phase variation: how to create and coordinate population diversity.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2011; 14: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), providing a basis for identifying new epigenetically regulated operons and giving insight into the function of the other unmethylated GATC sites in the E. coli genome. We want to explore how Dam behaves at these unique regions. Initial studies on unmethylated DNA showed that Dam is able to methylate the adenines on both DNA strands within a single cognate site before dissociation, which was referred to as intrasite processivity (15Coffin S.R. Reich N.O. Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase: intrasite processivity and substrate-induced dimerization and activation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7399-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, the enzyme must switch strands and reorient itself, breaking and reforming its contacts with the DNA (Fig. 2A). The restriction endonucleases BfiI (16Sasnauskas G. Zakrys L.

The phenomenon of intrasite processivity is suggestive of hopping, where proteins interact with and move along DNA not only by one-dimensional sliding, but by using several dissociation-reassociation steps (18Halford S.E. Marko J.F. How do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their targets?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 19Stanford N.P. Szczelkun M.D. Marko J.F. Halford S.E. One- and three-dimensional pathways for proteins to reach specific DNA sites.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6546-6557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Although diverse techniques have been used to show that several proteins rely on mechanisms other than sliding (20Tafvizi A. Mirny L.A. van Oijen A.M.

Searching DNA via a “Monkey Bar” mechanism: the significance of disordered tails.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 396: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), there are limited details about how hopping works. Hopping has generated significant interest as a way to understand how proteins can efficiently find their recognition sites when an overwhelming excess of nonspecific DNA is present (22Zhou H.X. Rapid search for specific sites on DNA through conformational switch of nonspecifically bound proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 8651-8656Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Hopping has also been used to explain how an enzyme can processively modify DNA when two or more sites have the opposite strand orientation, requiring the enzyme to reorient itself between modifying the first and subsequent sites (Fig. 2B). Importantly, during this process, the enzyme has a greater probability of rebinding the original DNA molecule than binding to another DNA molecule. Several enzymes display this activity, including T4 Dam (23Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Sclavi B. Buckle M. Hattman S.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15883-15888Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Given the diversity of enzymes that can switch DNA strands and the general lack of mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes, we sought to explore the factors that regulate the intrasite hopping mechanism of Dam. Our original description of intrasite methylation by Dam relied on short, single site synthetic double-stranded DNA (15Coffin S.R. Reich N.O. Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase: intrasite processivity and substrate-induced dimerization and activation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7399-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, prior work with plasmids showed that this activity is largely suppressed (1Herman G.E. Modrich P. Escherichia coli dam methylase: physical and catalytic properties of the homogeneous enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2605-2612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that flanking DNA segments longer than those used in our original studies may regulate this activity. Although the majority of GATC sites on the bacterial genome are predicted to be separated by ∼260 bp, GATC sites known and postulated to be involved in gene regulation are generally separated by ∼10–100 bp (supplemental Fig. 1). The purpose of this study is to characterize how the sequence contexts of GATC sites, specifically their clustering, regulate the intrasite processivity of Dam, with the goal of better understanding the mechanisms of the varied roles of Dam in the cell. We also want to explore how proteins are able to processively modify their cognate sites by switching strands. All restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs. All synthetic DNA substrates and primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and Midland Certified Reagent and were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). They were annealed with their reverse complements in a 1:1 mixture for 5 min at 95 °C and allowed to cool to room temperature (∼5 h). Annealing was verified by PAGE. Substrate 1A (see Table 1) is 5′-GTTCGTCATGCATGCAATGGAAAAGATCAGGTACCTGAATCACGAACGTTAGGCATTCGC-3′. The substrate used in the mutant analysis (see Fig. 6) is: 5′-ATCGTGGACTTCTACTTGGATGGAGGATCGGATGACACGTATTCCAGGAATTCACGTTAC-3′. The production of several PCR amplicons used the following strategy. A synthetic oligonucleotide with two GATC sites and two restriction sites between the GATC sites was cloned into plasmid pBR322 (New England Biolabs). 362- and 777-bp spacers were generated by PCR and cloned into the plasmid, generating different distances between the GATC sites. These plasmids were PCR-amplified with different primers to adjust the spacings from the GATC sites to the ends of the DNA. The same strategy applied to an engineered vector with a single GATC site.TABLE 1Intrasite processivity is modulated by lengths of flanking DNAFIGURE 6Intrasite processivity of Dam mutants.

The cloned, synthetic insert had additional cloning sites within it: XmaI and NcoI (bolded and italicized). These sites were used to insert PCR-purified spacers between the two GATC site(s) (underlined). Upon PCR amplification, the spacers were digested with XmaI and NcoI to generate overhangs. The spacers were generated by PCR from the plasmid pBR322 with restriction sites using the same forward primer: 5′-ATTCCCGGGGGCTACCCTGTGGAACACCT-3′,with different reverse primers for each sized spacer: substrates 2C and 2D from Table 1, 5′-TAATCCATGGGCAGCTGCGGTAAAGCTCAT-3′, substrate 2E from Table 1, 5′-TAATCCATGGCATGTTCTTTCCTGCGTTATCCCC-3′.Plasmid pBRMut0 was digested, and the spacers were inserted, making plasmids pBRMut2 and pBRMut3. Amplicons with 115/119-bp flanking GATC sites were amplified from plasmid pBRMut0,2,3 using primers: forward, 5′-GGGTTCCGCGCACATTTCCC-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCAGGGTGACGGTGCCGAGG-3′. Amplicons with 300-bp flanking GATC sites were amplified from plasmid pBRMut0,2,3 using primers: forward, 5′-GCATCTTTTACTTTCACCAGCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCTCCAAGTAGCGAAGCGAGC-3′. PCR amplicons were purified using the Agilent PCR clean-up kit and ethanol-precipitated to achieve the desired concentrations. All single turnover reactions were done in methylation reaction buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA) with 400 nm DNA, 420 nm Dam, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, and 30 μm S-adenosylmethionine (6 Ci/mmol mixture of unlabeled and [3H]methyl-labeled, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were initiated with DNA with a total volume ranging from 60 to 80 μl and were done at 15 °C. 8-μl reaction fractions were quenched with 8 μl of 1% SDS. 14.5-μl quenched fractions were spotted on DE81 filter paper. The paper was washed three times with a 50 mm KH2PO4 buffer, washed once in 80% ethanol, washed once in 95% ethanol, and dried in diethyl-ether; all washing steps were for 5 min. Papers were dried and submerged in Bio-Safe II scintillation fluid. Tritium levels were quantified using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter and converted to nm of DNA product. Plateau levels of 100% were defined by the complete methylation-available adenines in the reaction mixture. All single turnover tritium reactions were fit to a single exponential (Equation 1, A0 is the plateau level, which is 100%).Percentage of Conversion=A0(1−e−kt)(Eq. 1) 2.5 μl of the single turnover (here, 30 μm of unlabeled S-adenosylmethionine) assay was heat-inactivated in 14.8 μl of 75 °C water for 20 min. After slow cooling, 2 μl of NEBuffer 4 was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for ∼20 min. 0.7 μl of DpnI was added to NEBuffer (14 units), and the solution was rapidly mixed. The cutting reaction proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C until it was heat-inactivated in an 80 °C water bath for 20 min and slow-cooled to room temperature for subsequent gel analysis. The reaction products were analyzed using PAGE (20–5% 29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, depending on substrate length) for 2 h at 300 V in Tris-boric acid EDTA. Gels were stained with SybrAu and scanned on a Typhoon PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Nucleic acids were quantified using the software provided with the Typhoon. The densities of the different nucleic acid bands after several hours of reaction incubation (complete methylation) and subsequent digestion with the DpnI restriction endonuclease are defined as having the reaction being 100% complete (supplemental Figs. 2 and 4, which include sample gels). The competition experiment consisted of a single turnover reaction with substrate 1A, to which an equimolar amount of a 500-bp nonspecific (no GATC sites) piece of DNA was added. The reaction was initiated with a mixture of substrate 1A and the nonspecific DNA. The nonspecific DNA was generated by PCR using plasmid pBR322 as a template and the forward primer 5′-ATTCCCGGGGGCTACCCTGTGGAACACCT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TAATCCATGGCCCGGCATCCGCTTACAGAC-3′. Dam was expressed and purified as described previously (27Mashhoon N. Carroll M. Pruss C. Eberhard J. Ishikawa S. Estabrook R.A. Reich N. Functional characterization of Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase, a novel target for antibiotics.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52075-52081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In summary, Dam was overexpressed in XL2 Blue (Stratagene) E. coli cells grown at 37 °C in LB media with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. After reaching an optical density of 0.4–0.6, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.05% l-arabinose and grown for 2 h. The pellets were resuspended in 40 ml of P11 buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and lysed by sonication: 70% amplitude, 2 s on, 15 s off, total time 1 min. Lysate was centrifuged for 60 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant was loaded onto a 60-ml phosphocellulose (Whatman) column. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient from 0.2 and 0.8 m NaCl, and fractions with Dam were pooled and dialyzed in Blue Sepharose buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol). Upon overnight dialysis, the protein was loaded onto a 20-ml Blue Sepharose 6 FastFlow (GE Healthcare) column and eluted with a salt gradient between 0 and 1.5 m NaCl. Fractions were pooled and flash frozen at −80 °C. The protein concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of 1.16 mg−1cm−1 at 280 nm. The original evidence for intrasite processive methylation relied on single turnover experiments and a tritiated S-adenosylmethionine assay with a single site 21-bp double-stranded DNA substrate (15Coffin S.R. Reich N.O. Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase: intrasite processivity and substrate-induced dimerization and activation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7399-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For Dam, product release is rate-limiting, and the observed rate constant from a single turnover reaction is the methyl transfer rate constant, kchem (27Mashhoon N. Carroll M. Pruss C. Eberhard J. Ishikawa S. Estabrook R.A. Reich N. Functional characterization of Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase, a novel target for antibiotics.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52075-52081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our experiments are defined as single turnover because enzyme is in excess of DNA molecules, but not available adenines, and the addition of more enzyme does not alter kchem (data not shown). The tritium assay measures total methylation, which can be both single and double methylation (of a single site, which has two adenines); it cannot be used to directly monitor the formation of double methylation. Here, we sought to track double methylation events exclusively. To address this, we developed an assay using the restriction endonuclease DpnI, which cuts doubly methylated GATC sites significantly more efficiently than hemimethylated sites. We optimized conditions so that no hemimethylated DNA was cut and >85% of doubly methylated DNA was cut (supplemental Materials and Methods, supplemental Fig. 2). This was done to confirm that the reaction defined as intrasite processive involved no hemimethylated intermediates. To validate this assay, the DpnI cutting profile was compared with the tritium assay, giving the same rate constant (Fig. 3A). This confirms that for this substrate (1B from Table 1), both experimental methods, which are identical except for the readout, measure the rate of double methylation, the action defined as intrasite processivity. Dam does not always display intrasite processivity, as demonstrated by a delay in the DpnI cutting profile in comparison with the tritium data (Fig. 3B, substrate 1C, Table 1). The discrepancy in the observed activity of the two methods is attributed to the presence of a hemimethylated intermediate, which is enumerated in the tritium assay, but not by DpnI. Using the tritium data, the DpnI data, and kinetic modeling, we confirmed that this delay represents an almost completely non-intrasite processive mechanism, which will be referred to as sequential. For the sequential reaction, Dam methylates one strand and then completely dissociates from the DNA before returning to methylate the second strand. The ability of Dam to fully methylate a GATC site can be simplified into the reaction scheme in Fig. 3C, and the individual components can be tracked by (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4) (k1 and k2 are as described in Fig. 3; A0 is the plateau level, which is 100%) regardless of its methylation mechanism (28Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman, New York1998: 143-145Google Scholar). These equations are used to relate the tritium data to the DpnI data, both of which are read-outs for the same reaction. Although k1 and k2 represent observed rates of methylation, imbedded in each term are several other events, such as DNA binding, translocation, and methylation. Several groups have used the strategy employed here of directly monitoring activity, not including the other microscopic rate constants, to model processive, nonprocessive, and partially processive events (24Porecha R.H. Stivers J.T. Uracil DNA glycosylase uses DNA hopping and short-range sliding to trap extrahelical uracils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10791-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 26Gowers D.M. Wilson G.G. Halford S.E. Measurement of the contributions of one-dimensional and three-dimensional pathways to the translocation of a protein along DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15883-15888Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Processivity is defined simply as the relative enhancement in k2 over k1. Knowing the values of k1 and k2 allows one to profile individual species of the reaction separately, showing the amount of single methylation, double methylation, and total methylation (which is a combination of single and double methylation) at any time point. The double methylation product profile is equivalent to the DpnI data. Total methylation, reflecting the sum of hemimethylation (B, Equation 2) and double methylation (C, Equation 3), is equivalent to the tritium data (Equation 4). Therefore, k1 and k2 can be modeled using a least squares fit such that the tritium data match the trace from Equation 4 and the DpnI data match the trace for Equation 3 (Fig. 3D). In summary, the legitimacy of the DpnI assay is confirmed by deriving rate constants from the DpnI data and matching the trace with the tritium data. Hemimethylation (B)=(A0k1/(k2−k1))(e−k1t−e−k2t)(Eq. 2) Double methylation (C)=A0[1+(1/(k1−k2))(k2e−k1t−k1e−k2t)](Eq. 3) Total methylation=B+2C(Eq. 4) For an intrasite processive event, k2 is much faster than k1; the initial methylation is followed by a rapid methylation of the opposite strand with no detectable hemimethylated products. The enhancement in k2 comes from the enzyme maintaining contact with the DNA during both methylations, foregoing dissociation and rebinding steps. Alternatively, for a sequential reaction, each methylation event involves free enzyme poised to bind DNA, and the first methylation event would not affect the second methylation. Because the rate of the methylation of hemimethylated to fully methylated is close to that of nonmethylated to fully methylated, k1 would be predicted to be similar to k2 for a sequential process (15Coffin S.R. Reich N.O. Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase: intrasite processivity and substrate-induced dimerization and activation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 7399-7410Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because enzymes can display a gradient of processivity, several ratios of k2:k1 were modeled to predict the DpnI traces of partially processive scenarios (supplemental Fig. 3). Notably, when k2 is only 10-fold larger than k1, the DpnI trace matches the tritium trace. This suggests that there is a narrow window of possible rate constants between sequential and intrasite methylation. A sequential process requires the enzyme to undergo product dissociation, the rate-limiting step, and release of the cofactor product before the second methylation step can occur. These processes could make k2 slower than the observed rate of k1. Given this reasoning, it is impossible to define what ratio of k1:k2 would constitute a truly sequential process. Interestingly, the tritium data fit to a single exponential (one observable rate constant) for both sequential and intrasite methylation. This observation can be rationalized. If the site is methylated entirely via an intrasite mechanism, the second rate constant is too fast to be detectable; when sequential, the two rate constants approach each other, again resulting in what appears to be a single exponential.
