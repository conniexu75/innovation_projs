https://openalex.org/W2013499150,"Ethanol produced from cellulosic biomass is examined as a large-scale transportation fuel. Desirable features include ethanol's fuel properties as well as benefits with respect to urban air quality, global climate change, balance of trade, and energy security. Energy balance, feedstock supply, and environmental impact considerations are not seen as significant barriers to the widespread use of fuel ethanol derived from cellulosic biomass. Conversion economics is the key obstacle to be overcome. In light of past progress and future prospects for research-driven improvements, a cost-competitive process appears possible in a decade."
https://openalex.org/W1984060692,"Liquid crystals are remarkably useful for laboratory exploration of the dynamics of cosmologically relevant defects. They are convenient to work with, they allow the direct study of the ""scaling solution"" for a network of strings, and they provide a model for the evolution of monopoles and texture. Experiments described here support the simple ""one-scale"" model for cosmic string evolution, as well as some qualitative predictions of string statistical mechanics. The structure of monopoles and their apparent cylindrical but not spherical symmetry is discussed. A particular kind of defect known as texture is described and is shown to have a dynamical instability-it can decay into a monopole-antimonopole pair. This decay process has been observed occurring in the liquid crystal, and studied with numerical simulations."
https://openalex.org/W2074621919,"Zooxanthellae are unicellular algae that occur as endosymbionts in many hundreds of marine invertebrate species. Because zooxanthellae have traditionally been difficult to classify, little is known about the natural history of these symbioses. Zooxanthellae were isolated from 131 individuals in 22 host taxa and characterized by the use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in nuclear genes that encode small ribosomal subunit RNA (ssRNA). Six algal RFLPs, distributed host species specifically, were detected. Individual hosts contained one algal RFLP. Zooxanthella phylogenetic relationships were estimated from 22 algal ssRNA sequences-one from each host species. Closely related algae were found in dissimilar hosts, suggesting that animal and algal lineages have maintained a flexible evolutionary relation with each other."

https://openalex.org/W2036564595,"The processes involved in the dissolution and growth of crystals are closely related. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of faceted pits (called negative crystals) formed during quartz dissolution reveals subtle details of these underlying physical mechanisms for silicates. In imaging these surfaces, the AFM detected ledges <1 nanometer (nm) high that were spaced 10 to 90 nm apart. A dislocation pit, invisible to optical and scanning electron microscopy measurements and serving as a ledge source, was also imaged. These observations confirm the applicability of ledge-motion models to dissolution and growth of silicates; coupled with measurements of dissolution rate on facets, these methods provide a powerful tool for probing mineral surface kinetics."

Thus, this damselfish enhances local diversity on reefs through ""intermediate-disturbance"" effects, and is a keystone species that decreases rather than increases overall predation intensity relative to areas where it is absent."

https://openalex.org/W1993405998,"The thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of solubility are fairly well understood. It is still very difficult, however, to make quantitative predictions of solubility for real systems from first principles. The purposes of this article are to present the results of solubility experiments in some prototype solute-solvent systems, to show how far they may be understood from molecular first principles, and to discuss some of the things that are still missing. The main systems used as examples have the inert gas xenon as solute and some simple organic liquids as solvents."
https://openalex.org/W2085282931,"Measurements of flow patterns and water velocities inside the oral cavity of blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), made with a fiberoptic endoscope and thermistor flow probe, revealed that gill-arch structures act in blackfish as barriers that direct particle-laden water to the mucus-covered roof of the oral cavity, where particles are retained. Gill-arch structures have previously been assumed to be the site of particle retention in suspension-feeding fishes. Water does not pass between these structures in blackfish, and they do not serve as filters that separate particles from the water. These results emphasize the importance of directly assessing flow velocity and direction inside the oral cavity of vertebrate suspension feeders, particularly at the level of the filtering elements."
https://openalex.org/W1999826394,"Female treehoppers (Publilia reticulata Van Duzee) modify their parental care behavior in the presence of ants. Females with untended young remain with their original brood, but females from ant-tended colonies readily desert their first brood and produce additional clutches. Care by female treehoppers, in the absence of ants, increases the probability that a colony will produce some survivors, but ant attendance greatly increases the number of surviving nymphs."
https://openalex.org/W2022726020,"Although most warm-water molluscs have planktotrophic larval stages, some living families of tropical neogastropods are dominated by nonplanktotrophic development. Fossil protoconchs of early Tertiary neogastropods indicate that some families became progressively dominated by nonplanktotrophic development through time. This trend may be the result of higher speciation rates for nonplanktotrophs and a unidirectional trend in developmental change."

https://openalex.org/W2061830574,"It is suggested that, by assigning to every resource use and activity (including childbirth) that causes environmental impact a price in money-independent units (NRU's), a new system of environmental trade-offs can be established-one which maintains maximum personal choice within overall environmental constraint. The social equality of the system in relation to resource exploitation would be enhanced by distributing NRU rations equally among the population each year. Special means of controlling industrial and organizational use of resources through NRU's are also discussed. The system is believed to offer a more sensitive means of gauging social priorities in relation to resource use than that achieved by an exclusively monetary system. Although involving more planning and more governmental regulation than is currently deemed feasible or acceptable, we believe the mechanism would lead to less restriction of personal freedom in a steady-state society than would the current trend toward unsystematic imposition of governmental regulations."

https://openalex.org/W2079945380,"With the ever-increasing complexity of integrated circuits, manual design methods have become intolerably slow and error-prone. The use of computers to automate some or all of the design process is necessary to minimize both design time and error incidence. In this article are discussed the design and fabrication of integrated circuits, selected techniques of design automation, and the problems associated with such automation."
