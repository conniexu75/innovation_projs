https://openalex.org/W2000680568,"Severe reduction of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica has focused increasing concern on the biological effects of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation (280 to 320 nanometers). Measurements of photosynthesis from an experimental system, in which phytoplankton are exposed to a broad range of irradiance treatments, are fit to an analytical model to provide the spectral biological weighting function that can be used to predict the short-term effects of ozone depletion on aquatic photosynthesis. Results show that UVA (320 to 400 nanometers) significantly inhibits the photosynthesis of a marine diatom and a dinoflagellate, and that the effects of UVB are even more severe. Application of the model suggests that the Antarctic ozone hole might reduce near-surface photosynthesis by 12 to 15 percent, but less so at depth. The experimental system makes possible routine estimation of spectral weightings for natural phytoplankton."
https://openalex.org/W1978389347,"The first unambiguous full-disk radar mapping of Mercury at 3.5-centimeter wavelength, with the Goldstone 70-meter antenna transmitting and 26 antennas of the Very Large Array receiving, has provided evidence for the presence of polar ice. The radar experiments, conducted on 8 and 23 August 1991, were designed to image the half of Mercury not photographed by Mariner 10. The orbital geometry allowed viewing beyond the north pole of Mercury; a highly reflective region was clearly visible on the north pole during both experiments. This polar region has areas in which the circular polarization ratio (pt) was 1.0 to 1.4; values < approximately 0.1 are typical for terrestrial planets. Such high values of have hitherto been observed in radar observations only from icy regions of Mars and icy outer planet satellites."

This natural occurrence has important bearing on the recognition of meteorite impact craters in quartz-bearing geologic formations."
https://openalex.org/W2033474602,A random-code technique has been used at Arecibo to obtain delay-Doppler radar images of the full disk of Mercury. Anomalously bright features were found at the north and south poles. The north polar feature is oblong (4° by 8°) and offset from the pole. The smaller south polar feature is mostly confined to the floor of the crater Chao Meng-Fu. The polar locations and radar properties of these features indicate that they may be produced by volume scattering in ice. The images also reveal a variety of more subdued reflectivity features ranging in size from hundreds to thousands of kilometers; some of these appear to have an impact origin.

https://openalex.org/W2045687864,The Japanese Yohkoh satellite is now in orbit observing the sun with a set of x-ray imagers and x-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers. The data from this successful mission provide new information on solar flares and the sun's corona. This paper discusses the Yohkoh observations and presents a sample of the first scientific results from the mission.
https://openalex.org/W2060836352,"Recent radar observations of Mercury have revealed the presence of anomalous radar reflectivity and polarization features near its north and south poles. Thermal model calculations show that, despite Mercury's proximity to the sun, the temperatures of flat, low-reflectivity surfaces at Mercury's poles are not expected to exceed 167 kelvin. The locations of the anomalous polar radar features appear to be correlated with the locations of large, high-latitude impact craters. Maximum surface temperatures in the permanently shadowed regions of these craters are expected to be significantly colder, as low as 60 kelvin in the largest craters. These results are consistent with the presence of water ice, because at temperatures lower than 112 kelvin, water ice should be stable to evaporation over time scales of billions of years."
https://openalex.org/W2057060201,"Recent seismic tomography of the Earth's mantle has revealed a large-scale pattern of mantle convection comprising upwelling columnar plumes in the Pacific and Africa and downwelling planar sheets along the Circum Pacific. Upwelling and downwelling occur most extensively under the south Pacific and west Pacific, respectively. High-resolution image of plate subduction has been obtained from the dense seismic networks around Japan. Japanese seismologists are in the best position to resolve the internal structure of downwelling current as an integral part of the whole convection system."

Alcohol consumption increased during, and decreased after, avoidance sessions. Water intake remained the same or decreased during avoidance sessions and stayed at this level after the sessions."

https://openalex.org/W2049230241,"Several sounds are produced by minnows. Only one is not of purely mechanical origin, and it is classed as a ""biological"" sound. This sound is variously produced by males when fighting and chasing as well as during courtship. Females emit a similar sound. Testosterone injections and elevated temperatures result in an increased rate of biological sound emission."
https://openalex.org/W1988156406,Light intensities of the order of 1/20th that of normal sunlight are sufficient to kill ostracods from two different caves. Loss of physiological protection against light has probably occurred through the same mechanism which has resulted in the much better known loss of morphological characters in cave animals.

https://openalex.org/W2038941327,A description is given of a soil percolator which has been used both for instructional purposes and for microbiological research and has been found accurate and easy to operate. It could be used for aerobic and anaerobic experiments with a soil under water-saturated conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2076910010,"While Anderson (1992) states that his theory of high-temperature conductivity is consistent with many experimental constraints, most (and perhaps all) of his observations and explanations have been produced after obtaining experimental results. It is suggested that he describe an experimental test that might prove his theory wrong. Anderson replies that the predictive power of his theory is attested by three notable post-theory confirmations, and notes that the theory has passed all experimental tests to date. 4 refs."
