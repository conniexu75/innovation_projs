https://openalex.org/W2091536410,"The mechanism of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α signaling is unknown. TNF-α signaling may involve sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide by a sphingomyelinase and stimulation of a ceramide-activated protein kinase. In a cell-free system, TNF-α induced a rapid reduction in membrane sphingomyelin content and a quantitative elevation in ceramide concentrations. Ceramide-activated protein kinase activity also increased. Kinase activation was mimicked by addition of sphingomyelinase but not by phospholipases A2, C, or D. Reconstitution of this cascade in a cell-free system demonstrates tight coupling to the receptor, suggesting this is a signal transduction pathway for TNF-α."

https://openalex.org/W2025781389,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli by phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues. Xp42 is a Xenopus laevis MAP kinase that is activated during oocyte maturation. Modified forms of Xp42 that lacked enzymatic activity or either of the phosphorylation sites were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. When meiotic maturation was induced with progesterone, each mutant Xp42 was phosphorylated, indicating that at least one kinase was activated that can phosphorylate Xp42 on tyrosine and threonine. Phosphorylation of one residue is not strictly dependent on phosphorylation of the other."
https://openalex.org/W1520800891,"Abstract The carbohydrate binding specificity of Mr = 30,000 lectin (CBP30) from baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells has been studied by inhibition of binding of the radiolabeled lectin to asialofetuin-Sepharose using model oligosaccharides and glycopeptides. CBP30 binds type I or II Gal beta(1----3(4))GlcNAc chains but not Gal(beta 1----3)GalNAc. The inhibitory potency of straight chain polylactosamine structures or complex-type branched glycans is increased in proportion to the number of Gal(beta 1----3(4)) units present. Fucosylation or sialylation of terminal galactose residues or further substitution by (alpha 1----3)-linked galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine does not affect binding whereas substitution of the penultimate N-acetylglucosamine residue drastically reduces binding. Thus, blood group A, H type I or H type II structures, shows high affinity whereas Lex, Lea, and Leb structures bind poorly. CBP30 binds to murine Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor laminin and human amniotic fluid fibronectin but not human plasma fibronectin. Binding involves polylactosamine glycans as well as tri- and tetraantennary complex-type glycans present in EHS laminin and amniotic fluid fibronectin but absent in plasma fibronectin. Proteolytic fragments of EHS laminin (E1X/Nd, P1, E8, and E3) bind CBP30, but only fragment E8 supports attachment and spreading of BHK cells. BHK cell adhesion to EHS laminin or fragment E8 was not disturbed by CBP30-specific antibodies, but at relatively high concentrations (45 micrograms/ml) CBP30 inhibited spreading and partially attachment of cells on laminin."
https://openalex.org/W2056468550,"A complementary DNA coding for a second type of activin receptor (ActRIIB) has been cloned from Xenopus laevis that fulfills the structural criteria of a transmembrane protein serine kinase. Ectodermal explants from embryos injected with activin receptor RNA show increased sensitivity to activin, as measured by the induction of muscle actin RNA. In addition, injected embryos display developmental defects characterized by inappropriate formation of dorsal mesodermal tissue. These results demonstrate that this receptor is involved in signal transduction and are consistent with the proposed role of activin in the induction and patterning of mesoderm in Xenopus embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2077047669,"In the murine T cell receptor delta locus, V(D)J recombination events frequently involve the D2 and J1 elements. Here we report the presence of double-strand breaks at recombination signals flanking D2 in approximately 2% of thymus DNA. An excised linear species containing the sequences between D2 and J1 and a circular product of the joining of D2 and J1 recombination signals were also found. Although broken molecules with signal ends were detected, no species with coding ends could be identified. Observation of these broken molecules in thymus, but not in liver or spleen, provides the first direct evidence for an association between specific cleavage of chromosomal DNA and recombination in mammalian cells, and supports a breakage-reunion model of V(D)J recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1634344740,"We have analyzed the nature of ligand-induced shift to higher molecular weight forms of the beta-receptor for platelet-derived growth factor expressed in porcine aortic endothelial cells. The modification of the beta-receptor was found to be due to polyubiquitination, as judged by immunoblotting using an anti-ubiquitin antiserum. A mutant beta-receptor made kinase negative by a point mutation (K634A mutant) did not undergo ubiquitination in response to ligand stimulation. A mutant in which carboxyl-terminal 98 amino acids were deleted (CT98 mutant) and which retained kinase activity was likewise not ubiquitinated. These data suggest that the kinase activity, as well as the carboxyl-terminal 98 amino acids, is required for ubiquitination of the beta-receptor. Ligand-induced degradation of the receptor-bound ligand, as well as of the receptor itself, was partially impaired in the CT98-receptor-expressing cells, suggesting that the ubiquitination is of importance for efficient degradation of the ligand-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1534981615,"We have previously demonstrated that growth hormone (GH) promotes an increase in tyrosine kinase activity associated with the GH receptor. To gain insight into the role of GH-dependent tyrosine kinase activity in signaling by GH, we investigated the possibility that GH might stimulate MAP kinase, a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase thought to be a common element in tyrosine kinase-initiated response cascades. Treatment of 3T3-F442A fibroblasts with 100 ng/ml GH results in a 3-6-fold increase in the ability of cell-free extracts to phosphorylate MAP-2 and myelin basic protein. GH-stimulated kinase activity is unaffected by heparin, H7, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor peptide, partially reduced by staurosporin and inhibited by fluoride and calcium ions, indicating that the kinase is not protein kinase C or A, casein kinase, or a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Based on gel permeation chromatography, the molecular mass of the GH-stimulated MAP kinase is approximately kDa. Furthermore, anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed the GH-dependent appearance of two phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in cell-free lysates of GH-treated cells that co-migrate with proteins recognized by anti-MAP kinase antibodies. The GH-dependent increase in MAP kinase activity displays a biphasic time course and is dependent on the concentration of GH applied to the cells. GH-dependent MAP kinase activity, partially purified by Mono-Q chromatography, is inactivated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Addition of H7 to the cells prior to the addition of GH has no effect, whereas addition of H8 increases MAP kinase activity in control cells with no effect in GH-treated cells, indicating that protein kinase C is unlikely to be an intermediary in the GH-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase activity. These findings indicate that signaling by GH in 3T3-F443A cells may, at least in part, utilize a kinase cascade similar to those that have been proposed for other membrane receptors with associated tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1551764266,"The human 72-kDa (CLG4A) and 92-kDa (CLG4B) type IV collagenases contain a domain consisting of three contiguous copies of the fibronectin (FN)-derived type II homology unit (T2HU), T2HU-1, T2HU-2, and T2HU-3. To investigate the functional role of this domain, we have constructed plasmids expressing beta-galactosidase fusion proteins with one or more of the CLG4B-derived T2HU. The gelatin binding assays demonstrate that a single copy of T2HU-2 renders beta-galactosidase capable of binding gelatin. The three repeats, however, differ dramatically in their capacity to bind gelatin, with T2HU-1 and T2HU-3 having significantly less binding activity than T2HU-2. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis we have defined the amino acid residues (Arg307, Asp309, Asn319, Tyr320, Asp323) that are critical for gelatin binding of T2HU-2. The low gelatin binding of T2HU-1 compared to T2HU-2 was traced to the non-conserved residues Ala228-Ala and Leu253-Pro. The results suggest that the gelatin binding of the type IV collagenase proenzyme is mediated by the FN-like domain, although the presence of another gelatin-binding site cannot be excluded. The FN domain-mediated binding, however, is not a rate-limiting step in the hydrolysis of gelatin by the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1986905652,"We have developed an in vitro reaction system for Drosophila P element transposition. Transposition products were recovered by selection in E. coli, and contained simple P element insertions flanked by 8 bp target site duplications as observed in vivo. Transposition required Mg+2 and partially purified P element transposase. Unlike other DNA rearrangement reactions, P element transposition in vitro used GTP as a cofactor; deoxyGTP, dideoxyGTP, or the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs GMP-PNP or GMP-PCP were also used. Transposon DNA molecules cleaved at the P element termini were able to transpose, but those lacking 3'-hydroxyl groups were inactive. These biochemical data are consistent with genetic data suggesting that P element transposition occurs via a ""cut-and-paste"" mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1579835576,"The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of exogenous cholesterol on the apolipoprotein (Apo) B gene expression in HepG2 cells. Pure cholesterol had no significant effect on either the cellular content of cholesteryl esters or the net accumulation of neutral lipids and ApoB in the culture medium. By contrast, addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol increased the net accumulation of cholesteryl esters in cells and medium by 2-3-fold and decreased that of unesterified cholesterol by 50% in both compartments. A 33% reduction in the cellular content of triglycerides was commensurate with a 40% increase in their accumulation in the medium. A significant 3-fold increase in the net accumulation of ApoB in the medium was predominantly due to enhanced secretion of newly synthesized ApoB as established by pulse-chase studies. The stimulation in ApoB secretion was accompanied by a 55% increase in cellular ApoB mRNA. Under these experimental conditions, the low density lipoprotein receptor activity was decreased by only 12-20%. Addition of progesterone prevented the effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol. The changes in the concentration of neutral lipids and ApoB were reflected in the composition of secreted low-density lipoproteins. These particles had increased percentage contents of cholesteryl esters and ApoB and a decreased percentage content of unesterified cholesterol in comparison with lipoproteins produced by control cells. The rate of ApoB production was not correlated with the triglyceride mass in the cells but was positively correlated with the cellular and secreted cholesteryl esters and secreted triglycerides. With the exception of unchanged cellular unesterified cholesterol and ApoB mRNA levels, plasma low density lipoprotein had similar, although less pronounced, effects on the production of neutral lipids and ApoB. These results demonstrate that in HepG2 cells the synthesis and secretion of ApoB and cholesteryl esters are tightly coupled and that 25-hydroxycholesterol increased the concentration of ApoB-containing lipoproteins primarily by stimulating their production rather than reducing their catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1510329672,"The PriA replication protein of Escherichia coli (formerly replication factor Y or protein n') is multifunctional. It is a site-specific, single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase (dATPase), a 3'----5' DNA helicase, and guides the ordered assembly of the primosome, a mobile, multiprotein DNA replication priming/helicase complex. Although PriA is not absolutely required for viability, priA null mutant cells grow very slowly, have poor viability, and form extensive filaments. In order to assess which of the multiple activities of PriA are required for normal replication and growth, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to introduce single amino acid substitutions for the invariant lysine within the consensus nucleotide-binding motif found in PriA. Biochemical characterization of the representative purified mutant PriA proteins revealed them to be completely deficient in nucleotide hydrolysis, incapable of translocation along a single-stranded DNA binding protein-coated single-stranded DNA template, and unable to manifest the 3'----5' DNA helicase activity of wild-type PriA. These mutant proteins were, however, capable of catalyzing the assembly of active primosomes in vitro. Furthermore, when supplied in trans to insertionally inactivated priA cells, plasmids containing a copy of these mutant priA genes restored the wild-type growth rate, viability, and cell morphology. Based on these results, a model for PriA function in vivo is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2169539585,"The liganded Ah receptor activates transcription by binding to a specific DNA-recognition motif within a dioxin-responsive enhancer upstream of the CYP1A1 gene. Analyses of mutant enhancers by gel retardation reveal that each base pair within the domain 5'CGTG(GCAC)3' is essential to the receptor-enhancer interaction. The three base pairs immediately flanking each end of the essential domain contribute less strongly to receptor binding. Analyses of enhancer function by transfection reveal that a mutation in the essential domain, which abolishes receptor-DNA binding, obliterates enhancer function. Mutations outside the essential domain, which diminish, but do not abolish, receptor-DNA binding, also obliterate enhancer function. Additionally, one mutation adjacent to the essential binding motif does not affect receptor-DNA binding, but destroys enhancer activity. These findings imply that transcriptional enhancement by the dioxin-responsive system cannot be predicted solely by the strength of the receptor-enhancer interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1577427687,"Loss of sensitivity to thrombin following an initial response is characteristic of a number of cell types, including platelets. It has recently been proposed that thrombin receptors resemble other G protein-coupled receptors, but that activation involves a novel mechanism in which thrombin cleaves the receptor, exposing a new N terminus that serves as the ligand for the receptor. Based upon this model, we have examined the mechanism of thrombin receptor desensitization by comparing the effects of thrombin with those of a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal sequence of the receptor following proteolysis by thrombin: SFLLRNPNDKYEPF or TRP42/55. Like thrombin, TRP42/55 stimulated pertussis toxin-sensitive inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation, raised cytosolic Ca2+, and inhibited cAMP formation in the megakaryoblastic HEL cell line. Exposure to either thrombin or TRP42/55 desensitized the cells to both, but not to a third agonist, neuropeptide Y. The rate of recovery after desensitization depended upon the order of agonist addition. Resensitization of the cell to thrombin following a brief exposure to thrombin required up to 24 h and could be inhibited with cycloheximide. Resensitization to TRP42/55 after exposure to thrombin, or to thrombin after exposure to TRP42/55, on the other hand, was detectable within 30 min and could be inhibited by serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors, but not by cycloheximide. Loss of responsiveness to thrombin and TRP42/55 was also observed following addition of the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). However, while the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine completely prevented the desensitization caused by TPA, it had only a limited effect on the desensitization caused by TRP42/55. These results demonstrate that the G protein-mediated effects of thrombin can be reproduced by a receptor-derived peptide and suggest that desensitization occurs by at least two mechanisms. The first, which is seen with thrombin, but not TRP42/55, involves proteolysis and requires protein synthesis for recovery. The second, which occurs with TRP42/55 and TPA, as well as with thrombin, involves phosphorylation, possibly of the receptor itself. Although protien kinase C is activated by thrombin and is presumably responsible for the desensitization caused by TPA, it does not appear to play a major role in receptor desensitization caused by thrombin and TRP42/55. This suggests that other kinases, such as those which inactivate adrenergic receptors and rhodopsin, are involved in the down-regulation of thrombin receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1606810424,"Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell thrombin receptor that serves as a cofactor for thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C. Structural requirements for thrombin binding and cofactor activity were studied by mutagenesis of recombinant human thrombomodulin expressed on COS-7 and CV-1 cells. Deletion of the fourth epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain abolished cofactor activity but did not affect thrombin binding. Deletion of either the fifth or the sixth EGF-like domain markedly reduced both thrombin binding affinity and cofactor activity. Thrombin binding sequences were also localized by assaying the ability of synthetic peptides derived from thrombomodulin to compete with diisopropyl fluorophosphate-inactivated 125I-thrombin binding to thrombomodulin. The two most active peptides corresponded to (a) the entire third loop of the fifth EGF-like domain (Kp = 85 +/- 6 microM) and (b) parts of the second and third loops of the sixth EGF-like domain (Kp = 117 +/- 9 microM). These data suggest that thrombin interacts with two discrete elements in thrombomodulin. Deletion of the Ser/Thr-rich domain dramatically decreased both thrombin binding affinity and cofactor activity and also prevented the formation of a high molecular weight thrombomodulin species containing chondroitin sulfate. Substitutions of this domain with polypeptide segments of decreasing length and devoid of glycosylation sites progressively decreased both cofactor activity and thrombin binding affinity. This correlation suggests that increased proximity of the membrane surface to the thrombin binding site may hinder efficient thrombin binding and the subsequent activation of protein C. Membrane-bound thrombomodulin therefore requires the Ser/Thr-rich domain as an important spacer, in addition to EGF-like domains 4-6, for efficient protein C activation."
https://openalex.org/W1671652918,"Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) has been shown to inhibit 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-induced mouse P450IA1 benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity (Raunio, H., and Pelkonen, O. (1983) Cancer Res. 43, 782-786). When we co-administered TPA and TCDD to C57BL/6 mice, the accumulation of TCDD-inducible liver P450IA1 and P450IA2 mRNA, as well as kidney P450IA1 mRNA, was greatly inhibited. When nuclear run-on assays were conducted, maximal levels of transcriptional activation were achieved for both liver Cyp1a-1 and Cyp1a-2 with 1 micrograms/kg (approximately equal to 3.0 nmol/kg) TCDD. TCDD elicited a dose-dependent increase in the rates of gene transcription, which paralleled the induction of P450IA1 and P450IA2 mRNA. Only Cyp1a-1 gene transcription was elevated in kidney. When these experiments were repeated following the co-administration of TPA with TCDD, the levels of TCDD-mediated transcriptional increases in liver Cyp1a-1 and Cyp1a-2 and P450IA1 and P450IA2 mRNAs were dramatically inhibited. The reduction in Cyp1a gene transcription by TPA could be accounted for by reduced DNA binding of the dioxin receptor to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) sequences, as measured by gel-retardation analysis. Analysis of nuclear [3H]TCDD dioxin receptor by sucrose density gradients demonstrated that the inhibition of Cyp1a gene transcription and DNA binding by TPA resulted from a reduction in nuclear dioxin receptor concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1561474071,"The mechanism of the inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis by the phospholipid analogue, hexadecylphosphocholine, was investigated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In the presence of 50 mumol/liter hexadecylphosphocholine, there was a translocation of CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (EC 22.7.7.15) activity from the membranes to the cytosol of the cells. Since we recently demonstrated that hexadecylphosphocholine also inhibits protein kinase C in vitro, [methyl-3H]choline labeling experiments were repeated with phorbol ester-desensitized cells. In these cells the same inhibitory effect of hexadecylphosphocholine was measured. As a consequence of inhibition, the [methyl-3H]choline incorporation into the phosphocholine pool was increased time-dependently. In addition, there was no evidence for a difference between the choline uptake of control and hexadecylphosphocholine-treated cells. Likewise, the amount of diacylglycerol, a known activator of the translocation process, was not reduced. Finally, we showed that the inhibitory effect of hexadecylphosphocholine on CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase translocation cannot be explained by the detergent properties of this phospholipid analogue. Therefore, we suggest a direct inhibitory effect of hexadecylphosphocholine on the translocation of CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1505981323,"Nitrogenase binds and hydrolyzes 2MgATP yielding 2MgADP and 2Pi for each electron that is transferred from the iron protein to the MoFe protein. The iron protein alone binds but does not hydrolyze 2MgATP or 2MgADP and the binding of these nucleotides is competitive. Iron protein amino acid sequences all contain a putatitive mononucleotide-binding region similar to a region found in other mononucleotide-binding proteins. To examine the role of this region in MgATP interaction, we have substituted glutamine and proline for conserved lysine 15. The amino acid substitutions, K15Q and K15P, both yielded a non-N2-fixing phenotype when the genes coding for them were substituted into the Azotobacter vinelandii chromosome in place of the wild-type gene. The iron protein from the K15Q mutant was purified to homogeneity, whereas the protein from the K15P mutant could not be purified in its native form. Unlike wild-type iron protein, the purified K15Q iron protein showed no acetylene reduction, H2 evolution, or ATP hydrolysis activities when complemented with wild-type MoFe protein. The K15Q iron protein and the normal iron protein had a similar total iron content and both proteins showed the characteristic rhombic EPR signal resulting from the reduced state of the single 4Fe-4S cluster bridging the two subunits. Unlike the wild-type iron protein, addition of MgATP to the K15Q iron protein did not result in the perturbation necessary to change the EPR signal of its 4Fe-4S center from a rhombic to an axial line shape. Also unlike the wild-type iron protein, addition of MgATP to K15Q iron protein in the presence of the iron chelator, alpha,alpha'-dipyridyl, did not result in a time-dependent transfer of iron to the chelator. Thus, even though the K15Q iron protein contains a normal 4Fe-4S center, it does not respond to MgATP like the wild-type protein. Examination of the ability of the K15Q iron protein to bind MgADP showed no change from the wild-type iron protein, but its ability to bind MgATP decreased to 35% of the wild-type protein. Thus, in A. vinelandii iron protein, lysine 15 is not needed for interaction with MgADP but is involved in the binding of ATP, presumably through charge-charge interaction with the gamma-phosphate. Based on the above data, this lysine appears to be essential for the MgATP induced conformational change of wild-type iron protein that is required for activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2089773986,"In transgenic mice, muscle-specific regulatory elements from the myosin light chain (MLC) 1/3 locus drive graded expression of a linked CAT reporter gene in selected fast muscles along the anteroposterior axis of the adult animal. The gradient of MLC-CAT transcripts is established early in development, during the generation of somites from the paraxial mesoderm and the activation of myogenic factor gene expression, and is not reflected in the expression of the endogenous MLC1 gene. At later embryonic stages, the gradient of MLC-CAT transcripts persists in intercostal and intervertebral muscles, but is not maintained in other axial muscles. Profiles of CAT transgene activity reveal that the gradient is generated during the maturation of increasingly caudal somites, opposite to the direction of somite development, and is retained in dissociated somite cultures. We propose that coexpression of myogenic factors is necessary but not sufficient to regulate expression of the MLC-CAT transgene, which is responsive to additional positional cues in the embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1599210033,"Oxidation and redox cycling of the hydroxylated metabolites of the antimalarial drug primaquine (i.e. 5-hydroxyprimaquine, 5-hydroxydemethylprimaquine, and 5,6-dihydroxy-8-aminoquinoline) were studied. The three metabolites readily oxidized under physiological conditions, forming hydrogen peroxide and the corresponding quinone-imine derivatives as the main products. The latter compounds were characterized by visible, NMR, and infrared spectroscopy. Concomitant formation of drug-derived radicals and hydroxyl radicals was attested by direct and spin-trapping EPR experiments, respectively. The use of the spin stabilization method indicated that the radicals derived from 5-hydroxydemethylprimaquine and 5,6-dihydroxy-8-aminoquinoline are of the o-semiquinone type. Tentative structures are proposed for the radicals based on product identification and computer simulation of the experimental EPR spectra. The quinone-imines obtained from the reduced metabolites did not react at appreciable rates with NADPH but underwent redox cycling upon addition of ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase, forming hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. The effect of antioxidant enzymes on hydroxyl radical yield obtained during oxidation and redox cycling indicates that the main route for hydroxyl radical formation is the metal ion-catalyzed reaction between the drug-derived radicals and hydrogen peroxide. Taken together, the results indicate that hydrogen peroxide is the potential toxic product formed from the primaquine metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1488712328,"Abstract DNA-protein interactions before and after transcriptional activation of the carcinogen- and dioxin-inducible enhancer of the murine CYP1A1 gene were detected in vivo by treatment with dimethyl sulfate followed by ligation-mediated, polymerase chain reaction-aided genomic sequencing. Following 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) treatment of mouse Hepa-1 hepatoma cells, evidence of protein binding was detected at the sequence 5' CACGCNA/T 3' within two previously defined xenobiotic response elements (XREs). The observed XRE footprint was similar to that previously identified by in vitro methylation protection footprints and attributed to the binding protein for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin the Ah receptor. No XRE footprinting was observed in Hepa-1 mutant cells possessing a defective Ah receptor. Unexpectedly, evidence of protein binding was also detected at a G-rich DNA sequence immediately adjacent to one of the XREs. Footprinting of the G-rich sequence element, like that of XRE1 and XRE2, was dependent on the presence of a functional Ah receptor. The Ah receptor is therefore able to bind to its own DNA target sites in vivo and is also required for the binding of a second factor to the G-rich element."
https://openalex.org/W1546308520,"We studied the inhibition of tissue kallikrein by protein C inhibitor (PCI), a relatively unspecific heparin-dependent serine protease inhibitor present in plasma and urine. PCI inhibited the amidolytic activity (cleavage of H-D-valyl-L-leucyl-arginine-p-nitroaniline) of urinary kallikrein with an apparent second order rate constant of 2.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 and formed stable complexes (85 kDa) with urinary kallikrein as judged from silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Complex formation was time-dependent and was paralleled by a decrease in the intensity of the main PCI protein band (Mr = 57,000) and an increase in the intensity of the lower Mr (54,000) PCI form (cleaved inhibitor). Heparin interfered with the inhibition of tissue kallikrein by PCI and with the formation of tissue kallikrein-PCI complexes in a dose-dependent fashion and completely abolished PCI-tissue kallikrein interaction at 300 micrograms/ml. This is in contrast to findings on the interaction of PCI with all other target proteases studied so far (i.e. stimulation of inhibition by heparin) but is similar to the reaction pattern of 125I-labeled tissue kallikrein with so called kallikrein binding protein described in serum and other systems. To study a possible relationship between PCI and this kallikrein binding protein we incubated 125I-labeled urinary kallikrein in serum and in PCI-immunodepleted serum in the absence and presence of heparin and analyzed complex formation using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In normal serum, formed complexes co-migrated with complexes of purified PCI and 125I-kallikrein and were less intense in the presence of heparin. No complex formation at all was seen in PCI-depleted serum. Our data indicate that PCI may be a physiologically important endogenous inhibitor of tissue kallikrein and provide evidence that PCI may be identical to the previously described kallikrein binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1563332537,"Chain-breaking antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene, alpha-tocopherol, and probucol have been shown to decrease markedly the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Their mechanism of action appears to involve scavenging of LDL-lipid peroxyl radicals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of radical reactions produced during oxidation of LDL and LDL-containing probucol initiated by lipoxygenase or copper. In addition, we have investigated the possibility of a synergistic interaction between ascorbate and probucol in inhibiting the oxidation of LDL. Incubation of LDL-containing probucol and lipoxygenase produced a composite electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum due to the endogenous alpha-tocopheroxyl radical and probucol-derived phenoxyl radical. The spectral assignment was further verified by chemical oxidation of alpha-tocopherol and probucol. In the presence of ascorbic acid, these radicals in the LDL particle were reduced to their parent compounds with concomitant formation of the ascorbate radical. In both the peroxidation of linoleic acid and the copper-initiated peroxidation of LDL, the antioxidant activity of probucol was significantly increased by low (3-6 microM) concentrations of ascorbate. The probucol-dependent inhibition of LDL oxidation was enhanced in the presence of ascorbic acid. We conclude that the reaction between the phenoxyl radical of probucol and ascorbate results in a synergistic enhancement of the antioxidant capacity of these two compounds and speculate that such reactions could play a role in maintaining the antioxidant status of LDL during oxidative stress in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1541070883,"Neutrophils stimulated with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) release large quantities of superoxide (O2-) and exhibit phosphorylation of two proteins with molecular masses of 47(p47) and 49 kDa (p49). Addition of inhibitors of protein kinases (e.g. 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7)) to these cells after stimulation with PMA results in the loss of 32P from these proteins and a rapid cessation of O2- release (e.g. Heyworth, P. G., and Badwey, J. A. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1052, 299-305). In this paper we report that antagonists of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (okadaic acid, calyculin A) prevented both the loss of 32P from p47 and the termination of O2- release in stimulated neutrophils treated with H-7. Calyculin A also caused a remarkable hyperphosphorylation of a number of proteins in neutrophils and increased O2- release from these cells in response to a suboptimal amount of PMA. Enzymes present in both the soluble and particulate fractions of neutrophils catalyzed the near complete dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled p47 and p49 bound to Immobilon-P membranes. Dephosphorylation of these blotted phosphoproteins occurred at physiological rates and was inhibited by okadaic acid and calyculin A. These data strongly suggest that p47 undergoes a continual cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation throughout the period of O2- release when PMA is the stimulus. Moreover, we show that antagonists of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases block dephosphorylation of p47 both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that these enzymes may modulate O2- release under certain circumstances."

Thus we were able to discriminate and isolate four different DNA helicases called A, B, C, and D. DNA helicase A is identical with the enzyme described earlier (Thömmes, P., and Hübscher, U. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14347-14354). The four enzymes can be distinguished by (i) their putative molecular weights after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, (ii) glycerol gradient sedimentation under low and high salt conditions, (iii) sensitivity to salt, (iv) binding to DNA, (v) nucleoside- and deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate requirements, and (vi) by their direction of movement. DNA helicase A unwinds in the 3'—-5' direction on the DNA it was bound to, while DNA helicases B, C, and D do so in the 5'—-3' direction. DNA helicase D, and to some extent DNA helicases B and C, are able to unwind long substrates of more than 400 nucleotides. Replication factor A, a single-stranded heterotrimeric DNA binding protein involved in cellular DNA replication and DNA repair stimulates the DNA helicases. The stimulatory effect is most pronounced on DNA helicase A, where replication factor A enables this helicase to unwind longer substrates. DNA helicases B, C, and D are also stimulated by replication factor A. The effect of replication factor A appears to be specific since corresponding single-stranded DNA binding proteins from Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T4 have no or even a negative effect on the four DNA helicases. Heterologous human replication factor A has no stimulatory effect on any of the four DNA helicases suggesting a species specificity of these interactions. Thus it appears that mammalian cells possess, as does E. coli, a variety of different enzymes that can transiently abolish the double helical DNA structure in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2168756515,"Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping was used to detect lipid-derived free radicals generated by iron-induced oxidative stress in intact cells. Using the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl 1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), carbon-centered radical adducts were detected. These lipid-derived free radicals were formed during incubation of ferrous iron with U937 cells that were enriched with docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3). The EPR spectra exhibited apparent hyperfine splittings characteristic of a POBN/alkyl radical, aN = 15.63 +/- 0.06 G and aH = 2.66 +/- 0.03 G, generated as a result of beta-scission of alkoxyl radicals. Spin adduct formation depended on the FeSO4 content of the incubation medium and the number of 22:6-enriched cells present; when the cells were enriched with oleic acid (18:1n-9), spin adducts were not detected. This is the first direct demonstration, using EPR, of a lipid-derived radical formed in intact cells in response to oxidant stress."
https://openalex.org/W1556719010,"The extracellular portion of the type 1 (p55) and type 2 (p75) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors contains a repetitive amino acid sequence pattern of four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). This pattern is found also in several other cell surface proteins, including the p75 nerve growth factor receptor and the CD40, 4-1BB, OX40, Fas, and CD27 antigens. To investigate whether CRDs play a role in TNF binding, we have constructed soluble variants of the extracellular portion of human type 1 TNF receptor (sTNFR1), in which CRD1 (N-terminal) or CRD4 (C-terminal) was deleted by mutagenesis. These variants or a wild type sTNFR1 were linked in their C terminus to the hinge and Fc portion of IgG1 heavy chain to create sTNFR1-IgG chimeras (immunoadhesins). Deletion of either CRD1 or -4 did not cause any major perturbations in the structure of the sTNFR1 variants, as evidenced by their efficient expression and secretion from transfected cells, and by their binding to conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies that recognize diverse epitopes on sTNFR1. The wild type sTNFR1 immunoadhesin exhibited high affinity binding to TNF alpha (Kd = 65 pM) and TNF beta (Kd = 640 pM). Deletion of CRD4 resulted in about a 10-fold reduction in affinity for TNF alpha (Kd = 660 pM) and for TNF beta (Kd = 5.7 nM). In contrast, deletion of CRD1 resulted in a complete loss of binding to TNF alpha and to TNF beta. These results indicate that CRD4 is important but not necessary for TNF binding, while CRD1 is required. In addition, the results suggest some overlap between the TNFR1 binding sites for TNF alpha and TNF beta, despite low amino acid sequence homology between these cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W1563749009,"Purified G-protein (transducin) activated with the nonhydrolyzable analog guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) and cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) from retinal rods are added to protein-stripped disc membranes. Specific binding of the mainly soluble alpha subunit of G-protein with GTP gamma S bound (G alpha GTP gamma S, activator of the PDE) to the disc membrane in the presence of PDE is measured from gel scans or experiments with labeled G-protein alpha subunit (G alpha). Its variation as a function of G concentration matches the theoretical variation of G alpha involved in the activation of PDE calculated with previously estimated dissociation constants (Bennett, N., and Clerc, A. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 7418-7424), and the G alpha bound/PDE ratio at saturation is close to 2. No increase of G alpha binding to the membrane is observed when purified inhibitory subunit of PDE (PDE gamma) is added together with or instead of total PDE, and excess PDE gamma remains soluble. These results suggest that activated PDE is a complex with the activator G alpha GTP rather than PDE from which the inhibitory subunits have been removed. A method for purifying PDE gamma with a high yield of recovery and activity is described."
https://openalex.org/W1490570497,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) releases internal stores of calcium by binding to a specific membrane receptor which includes both the IP3 recognition site as well as the associated calcium channel. The IP3 receptor is regulated by ATP, calcium, and phosphorylation by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Its cDNA sequence predicts at least two consensus sequences where nucleotides might bind, and direct binding of ATP to the IP3 receptor has been demonstrated. In the present study, we demonstrate autophosphorylation of the purified and reconstituted IP3 receptor on serine and find serine protein kinase activity of the IP3 receptor toward a specific peptide substrate. Several independent purification procedures do not separate the IP3 receptor protein from the phosphorylating activity, and many different protein kinase activators and inhibitors do not identify protein kinases as contaminants. Also, renaturation experiments reveal autophosphorylation of the monomeric receptor on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1607665096,"We determined the essentiality of all amino acid replacements within an 11-codon sequence in the putative nucleoside-binding site of thymidine kinase encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1. This involved partial randomization of 11 codons in the gene to create a degenerate library, followed by genetic complementation using a tk- Escherichia coli strain and selection of unnatural active enzymes. We produced and tested 53,000 variants; of which 190 were found to be biologically active. Sequence analyses of functional variants revealed a high degree of flexibility in accommodating different types of amino acid substitutions in this region. However, no replacement was tolerated at proline-173, whereas tyrosine-172 could be replaced by only phenylalanine. To further define permissible substitutions at specified positions, we constructed a library with randomization at only four test codons. We produced and tested 600,000 variants; of which only 5 were active. Again proline-173 was conserved, and only tyrosine and phenylalanine were found at position 172. The identification of these conserved amino acids should provide important insights into the understanding of the structural basis of catalysis by this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1558405006,"Three small blue copper proteins designated auracyanin A, auracyanin B-1, and auracyanin B-2 have been isolated from the thermophilic green gliding photosynthetic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus. All three auracyanins are peripheral membrane proteins. Auracyanin A was described previously (Trost, J. T., McManus, J. D., Freeman, J. C., Ramakrishna, B. L., and Blankenship, R. E. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7858-7863) and is not glycosylated. The two B forms are glycoproteins and have almost identical properties to each other, but are distinct from the A form. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis apparent monomer molecular masses are 14 (A), 18 (B-2), and 22 (B-1) kDa. The amino acid sequences of the B forms are presented. All three proteins have similar absorbance, circular dichroism, and resonance Raman spectra, but the electron spin resonance signals are quite different. Laser flash photolysis kinetic analysis of the reactions of the three forms of auracyanin with lumiflavin and flavin mononucleotide semiquinones indicates that the site of electron transfer is negatively charged and has an accessibility similar to that found in other blue copper proteins. Copper analysis indicates that all three proteins contain 1 mol of copper per mol of protein. All three auracyanins exhibit a midpoint redox potential of +240 mV. Light-induced absorbance changes and electron spin resonance signals suggest that auracyanin A may play a role in photosynthetic electron transfer. Kinetic data indicate that all three proteins can donate electrons to cytochrome c-554, the electron donor to the photosynthetic reaction center."
https://openalex.org/W1484907956,"The defect in malignant hyperthermia (MH) alters the binding of [3H]ryanodine to the Ca(2+)-release channel by increasing its apparent affinity for the binding site. In sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from both normal and mutant pigs the apparent Kd is dependent on a number of parameters. Adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate, ionic strength, and Ca2+ each increase the apparent affinity of the binding site for [3H]ryanodine. Equilibrium and kinetic evaluation of the binding of [3H]ryanodine to these membranes demonstrates that the MH defect in pigs increases the apparent affinity of the membranes for [3H]ryanodine by increasing the amount of high affinity relative to low affinity binding sites. Both the association and dissociation of [3H]ryanodine with all three types of membranes (normal, heterozygous MH, homozygous MH) are characterized by two or more components, with the relative ratios of these components altered by the MH defect. These findings suggest that the observed Kd is the weighted average of the binding of ryanodine to two or more interconvertible states of the channel. Dilution of [3H]ryanodine bound to normal membranes at high Ca2+ into low Ca2+ solutions enhances the rate of dissociation. This conversion occurs to a much lesser extent with MH membranes, suggesting that the MH defect may alter the rate at which the high affinity form of the protein converts to the low affinity form."
https://openalex.org/W1607628815,"Phospholipid base exchange activity using choline as substrate was detected in plasma membranes (PM) and other subcellular fractions of rat liver, with microsomes (MS) showing the highest specific activity. In contrast, phospholipase D activity was only detected in PM. In PM, choline exchanged for phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS), whereas ethanolamine exchanged for PE and PS, and serine exchanged for PS. Ca2+ (10 microM or higher) stimulated choline incorporation into PC in MS and PM, whereas Mg2+ (10 microM or higher) stimulated it only in PM. Ethanolamine and serine incorporation into PM phospholipids was also stimulated by Ca2+, and inositol incorporation by Mn2+. Phospholipase D activity was substantial in the presence of EGTA and was slightly stimulated by Ca2+ concentrations less than 500 microM. It was undetectable without Mg2+. Low concentrations of oleate (1 mM or less) stimulated phospholipase D activity. These concentrations inhibited choline base exchange activity, whereas higher concentrations (3-8 mM) were stimulatory. Comparison of the subcellular distribution and Ca2+, Mg2+, and oleate effects on choline base exchange and phospholipase D activities supports the view that they are catalyzed by different enzymes. The incorporation of choline, but not ethanolamine or serine, into the phospholipids of PM, but not MS, was stimulated by micromolar concentrations of guanosine 5‘-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and other slowly hydrolyzable analogues of GTP. GDP, GMP, and other nucleoside triphosphates and their analogues were ineffective. GTP gamma S stimulation of base exchange activity was dependent upon Mg2+ and was inhibited by high concentrations of guanosine 5‘-O-2-(thio)diphosphate. In the presence of low concentrations of GTP gamma S, ATP and its slowly hydrolyzable analogues stimulated base exchange activity. Dose-response curves for these nucleotides revealed a potency order consistent with mediation by purinergic receptors of the P2Y type. Base exchange activity stimulated by ATP plus GTP gamma S or GTP gamma S alone was not altered by treatment with pertussis or cholera toxins. These results suggest that the choline base exchange activity of liver PM is regulated by a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein linked to P2Y purinergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1506180209,"In this study, we examined the mechanism of inhibition of phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPase) activity by elevated [Ca2+]i in insulin target cells. In in vitro studies, isolated rat adipocytes were incubated with either 40 mM K+ or parathyroid hormone (PTH) (20 ng/ml) for 1 h. In in vivo studies, rats were injected with PTH (three hourly injections of 40 micrograms intraperitoneally) prior to isolation of either adipocytes or skeletal muscle. Under these conditions, intracellular [Ca2+]i changed from 100 +/- 8.7 to 263 +/- 10.5 nM. There was concomitant 30% decrease in adipocyte PSPase activity and 35% decrease in skeletal muscle PSPase activity, assayed using 32P-labeled phosphorylase a as substrate. The inhibition of PSPase was accompanied by 60% increase in adipocytes (p less than 0.05) and 118% increase (p less than 0.01) in skeletal muscle inhibitor 1 (I1) activities, respectively. Since I1 is active only in the phosphorylated state, we studied the effect of [Ca2+]i on I1 phosphorylation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of heat treated extracts immunoprecipitated with I1 antibody revealed significant increase in 32P incorporation (45-60%, p less than 0.05) into I1 protein in cells with elevated [Ca2+]i. Nitrendipine, calcium channel blocker, completely prevented increases in I1 phosphorylation and activity in cells exposed to K+ but was only partially effective in the PTH-treated cells. In contrast, cyclic AMP antagonist, RpcAMP, prevented both the K(+)-and the PTH-induced increases in I1 phosphorylation and activity, even though it failed to block the elevations in [Ca2+]i in these cells. We conclude that [Ca2+]i-induced and cAMP-mediated phosphorylation and activation of I1 results in inhibition of PSPase activity in insulin target cells. The inhibition of PSPases may cause inappropriate serine dephosphorylation of substrates of insulin action resulting in insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1616577586,"Photooxidation of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome c2 and four site-directed mutants by detergent solubilized Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers was studied as a function of ionic strength at pH 8.0. Mutants of cytochrome c2 included K12D (lysine 12 substituted by aspartate), K14E (lysine 14 substituted by glutamate), K32E (lysine 32 substituted by glutamate), and K14E/K32E (lysines 14 and 32 substituted by glutamates). With respect to the wild-type, the mutants exhibited decreased second-order rate constants, indicating perturbation of their electrostatic interaction with the reaction center. In the transient complex, the interaction domain charges of the reaction center and wild-type cytochrome c2 were estimated to be -4.8 and +4.8, respectively. In contrast, the interaction domain charges of mutants K12D, K14E, K32E, and K14E/K32E were estimated to be +2.8, +3.7, +3.6 and +1.3, respectively. At infinite ionic strength, the second-order rate constant of the wild-type cytochrome c2 photooxidation (k infinity) was estimated to be 8.7 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. In the case of K32E, k infinity was not changed significantly (8.2 x 10(6) m-1 s-1), suggesting that the electrostatic perturbation of this mutant was largely overcome at high ionic strength. In contrast, the k infinity for K12D, K14E, and K14E/K32E were estimated to be decreased 2-7-fold. Consequently, mutations to R. capsulatus lysines 12 and 14 appear to perturb the distance and/or orientation of the cytochrome c2 relative to the reaction center in the reactive complex, as well as alter electrostatic interactions. Based upon the kinetic results presented here, the cytochrome c2-reaction center transient complex has been modeled."
https://openalex.org/W1586531753,"Facilitated glucose transport across plasma membranes is mediated by a family of transporters (GLUT1-GLUT5) that have different tissue distributions and Km values for transport. It has been shown that insulin stimulates glucose transport in fat and muscle tissues by causing the redistribution of one of these proteins (GLUT4) from inside the cell to the plasma membrane. Previous studies have shown that agents that change cAMP levels are able to modulate glucose transport in fat cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms responsible for modulation of glucose transport by cAMP. 2-Deoxyglucose transport and insulin-regulatable glucose transporter (GLUT4) immunoreactivity in plasma and low density microsomal membranes were measured in adipocytes incubated for 30 min with insulin or dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP). Low concentrations of Bt2cAMP (10 microM) increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake by translocating GLUT4 from low density microsomal membranes to the plasma membranes. Bt2cAMP at 1000 microM inhibited glucose transport below basal but further increased translocation of GLUT4. The effect of Bt2cAMP on translocation was additive to that of 7 nM insulin. We conclude that in rat adipocytes, Bt2cAMP acutely translocates GLUT4 but inhibits its activity to transport glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1489609153,"ATP promoted biphasic effects on both basal and fMLP-stimulated arachidonic acid (AA) release in neutrophil-like HL60 cells: stimulation in the micromolar range (EC50 = 3.2 +/- 0.9 microM) and inhibition at higher concentrations (EC50 = 90 +/- 11 microM). ATP also inhibited UTP- and platelet activating factor-stimulated AA release. Only stimulatory effects of ATP on basal or fMLP-stimulated phospholipase C were observed. The inhibitory effect of ATP on AA release was not due to reacylation of released AA, chelation of extracellular Ca2+, cell permeabilization, or changes in the rise of [Ca2+]i induced by agonist. The inhibition was rapid, being detected within 5-15 s. The inhibitory effect of ATP on fMLP-stimulated AA release could be desensitized by pretreatment of the cells with 2 mM ATP, but not 20 microM ATP, the concentration that resulted in maximal release of AA and inositol phosphates. The inhibition by ATP was neither dependent on generation of adenosine by ATP hydrolysis nor the result of direct interaction of ATP with P1 purinergic receptors. Among other nucleotides tested (CTP, GTP, ITP, TTP, XTP, adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMP-PCP), adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P), ADP, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (ATP gamma S), and UTP), only UTP and ATP gamma S displayed biphasic effects with potencies and efficacies almost identical to those of ATP. The other nucleotides only exhibited stimulatory effects (EC50 = 60-300 microM). The results are consistent with a model of dual regulation of AA release by two distinct subtypes of P2U receptors in HL60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1504849530,"It is now clear that complexes of cdc2 kinase with mitotic cyclins regulate the transition between the G2 phase of the cell cycle and mitosis and that membrane traffic in mammalian cells is arrested during mitosis. Using a cell-free assay, we have previously reported that the fusion of early endosomes is, in fact, inhibited via the cdc2 kinase (Tuomikoski, T., Felix, M.-A., Doree, M., and Gruenberg, J. (1989) Nature 342, 942-945). In the present paper, we show that this in vitro inhibition occurs efficiently only when the kinase activity is specifically evoked by a cyclin of the B-type but not by cyclins of the A-type. In addition, high resolution two-dimensional gel analysis revealed that the kinases associated with A- and B-type cyclins exhibit different substrate preferences. These data suggest that the complexes of the cdc2 kinase with different cyclins may control specific events of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1554944876,"The cytochrome b subunit of the bc1 complexes contains two cytochrome components (bL and bH) and is the locus of both a quinol-oxidizing site (Qo or Qz) and a quinone-reducing site (Qi or Qc). Sequence alignments of this subunit from over 20 eukaryotic and prokaryotic species have revealed a remarkable degree of conservation, including approximately 20 totally conserved residues. In this paper, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to examine the structural or functional roles of 5 of these highly conserved residues, Gly48, Gln58, Ser102, Phe104, and Pro202, all predicted to be within transmembrane alpha-helical segments. The mutants were made in the bc1 complex of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, a photosynthetic bacterium. The ability to use spectroscopic, electrochemical, and flash-induced kinetic methods allows the mutants to be analyzed for influences both on cytochrome spectra and thermodynamic properties and on the kinetics of specific electron transfer reactions. The results show that none of the 5 residues is absolutely essential. Substitution of aspartate or valine for Gly48 results in the loss of photosynthetic growth. The G48V mutant assembles a bc1 complex, but with modified cytochromes bH and bL, and a dysfunctional quinone reductase (Qc) site; an alanine is tolerated at this position. Possibly, a small residue is important here for heme packing. Gln58 and Ser102 are the only highly conserved polar residues predicted to be within the transmembrane spans, apart from the histidines which are heme axial ligands. Neither Gln58 nor Ser102 is essential for assembly or function of the bc1 complex, although substitution of other amino acids in these positions does cause subtle, but measurable changes. Phe104 lies midway between the axial ligands to cytochromes bL and bH and can be modeled to project in the space separating the two hemes. Replacement of this highly conserved aromatic residue by isoleucine has no measurable influence on the rate of electron transfer through the cytochrome b chain containing the two hemes. Finally, Pro202 is a totally conserved proline which is in the middle of transmembrane helix D, in between the 2 histidines which provide ligands to the hemes. No major inhibition of electron transfer resulted from replacing this proline by a leucine, although subtle changes in spectra of the b cytochromes and their electrochemical properties were noted."
https://openalex.org/W1510957322,"The fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase domain of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase has been shown to be structurally and functionally homologous to phosphoglycerate mutase. Both enzymes catalyze their reactions via phosphoenzyme intermediates which utilize an active site histidine as a nucleophilic phosphoacceptor and another histidine as a proton donor to the leaving group. Glu327 in the bisphosphatase domain of the rat liver bifunctional enzyme is conserved in all phosphoglycerate mutase structures and is postulated, by modelling studies, to be located in the active site. Glu327 was mutated to Ala, Gln, or Asp. The mutant and wild-type enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli with a T-7 RNA polymerase-based expression system and purified to homogeneity by substrate elution from phosphocellulose. The Glu327 mutants had apparent molecular weights of 110,000 by gel filtration and had unaltered 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activity. Circular dichroism showed that the secondary structure of the Glu327 mutant enzyme forms was the same as the wild-type enzyme. The maximal velocity of the fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase of the Glu327----Ala, Glu327----Gln, and Glu327----Asp mutants was 4, 2, and 20%, respectively, that of the wild-type enzyme, but the rate of phosphoenzyme formation of the mutants was reduced by at least a factor of 1000. In addition, the rate constants of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis for the Glu372----Ala and Glu327----Gln mutants were 2.7 and 1.3%, respectively, of the wild type, whereas the rate constant for the Glu327----Asp mutant was 60% of the wild-type value. Glu327 was not a substrate or product binding site determinant since the Km for fructose-2,6-bisphosphate and Ki for fructose-6-phosphate of the mutants were not appreciably changed. The results implicate Glu327 as part of a catalytic triad in fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase and suggest that it influences the protonation state of the active site histidine residues during phosphoenzyme formation and/or acts as a base catalyst to enhance the nucleophilic attack of water on the phosphoenzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1503768836,"To characterize the receptor(s) for human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF), a physiological hepatotrophic factor involved in liver regeneration following hepatic injury, recombinant hHGF (rhHGF) was radioiodinated. The labeled rhHGF retained its full biological activity on adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The specific binding of [125I]iodo-rhHGF to hepatocytes reached a plateau within 240 min at 4 degrees C. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data suggested the presence of two classes of high affinity binding sites for [125I]iodo-rhHGF. One of the sites had a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 4.6 pM with 300 sites/cell and the other has a Kd of about 275 pM with 15,160 sites/cell. Unlabeled rhHGF displaced cell surface-bound [125I]iodo-rhHGF in a dose-dependent manner as did native hHGF purified from plasma of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. However, other growth factors to rat hepatocytes in primary culture such as insulin and human epidermal growth factor, and proteins which have high amino acid sequence-homology to hHGF such as plasminogen and prothrombin, did not compete with [125I]iodo-rhHGF in the binding, which suggests the binding was specific to hHGF. Covalent cross-linking experiment of [125I]iodo-rhHGF to cell surface receptor(s) on hepatocytes showed there were two macromolecular species with apparent molecular weights of 330,000 and 230,000. Unlabeled rhHGF and native hHGF competed for the binding of [125I]iodo-rhHGF to the two macromolecular species, but insulin, human epidermal growth factor, plasminogen, and prothrombin did not. Based upon our estimated molecular weight of rhHGF = 84,000, these results suggest that hHGF specifically binds to two polypeptides of 246,000 and 146,000 daltons which are likely to represent the hHGF receptors of primary cultured rat hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1552514569,"Pre-steady-state phosphorylation of purified Na,K-ATPase from red outer medulla of pig kidney was studied at 25 degrees C and an ample range of [tau-32P]ATP concentrations. At 10 microM ATP phosphorylation followed simple exponential kinetics reaching after 40 ms a steady level of 0.76 +/- 0.04 nmol of P/mg of protein with kapp = 73.0 +/- 6.5 s-1. At 500 microM ATP the time course of phosphorylation changed drastically, since the phosphoenzyme reached a level two to four times higher at a much higher rate (kapp greater than or equal to 370 s-1) and in about 40 ms dropped to the same steady level as with 10 microM ATP. This superphosphorylation was not observed in Na,K-ATPase undergoing turnover in a medium with Mg2+, Na+, and ATP, suggesting that it required the enzyme to be at rest. Superphosphorylation depended on Mg2+ and Na+ and was fully inhibited by ouabain and FITC. After denaturation the phosphoenzyme made by superphosphorylation had the electrophoretic mobility of the alpha-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, and its hydrolysis was accelerated by hydroxylamine. On a molar basis, the stoichiometry of phosphate per ouabain bound was 2.40 +/- 0.60 after phosphorylation with 1000 microM ATP. The results are consistent with the idea that under proper conditions every functional Na,K-ATPase unit can accept two, or more, phosphates of rapid turnover from ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1504033768,"The binding, internalization, and degradation of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were studied in a rat hepatoma (Novikoff) cell line. Binding of t-PA to specific saturable high affinity binding sites (Kd = 12 nM, 54,000 sites/cell) was followed by internalization and degradation and did not require a functional active site. The catabolism of t-PA was not inhibited by an excess of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and t-PA bound to Novikoff membranes was not complexed to PAI-1, suggesting a mechanism independent of PAI-1. Additionally, a mannose receptor is not involved since t-PA binding was not influenced by an excess of mannose, galactose, ovalbumin, or EDTA. Furthermore, the degradation of t-PA was not influenced by 10 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, a lysine analogue. The t-PA receptor binds to and can be eluted from wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. Cross-linking of t-PA with partially purified receptor and ligand blot analysis, suggest that t-PA binds to two proteins, a principal one of 55 kDa and a minor one of 43 kDa. Novikoff cells are able also to bind (Kd = 1.4 nM, 25,000 sites/cell) and degrade u-PA. The binding was inhibited by pro-u-PA and the amino-terminal fragment of u-PA, but not by an excess of t-PA. The u-PA receptor, but not the t-PA receptor, was removed by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Our results show that the clearance receptor for t-PA on Novikoff cells is different from the mannose receptor and the PAI-1-dependent receptor described in other cells. The rat hepatoma cells are thus a good model to study the PAI-1 independent hepatocyte-specific clearance of t-PA."
https://openalex.org/W1527664600,"Lysine 274 is conserved in all known fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase sequences. It has been implicated in substrate binding and/or catalysis on the basis of reactivity with pyridoxal phosphate as well as by x-ray crystallographic analysis. Lys274 of rat liver fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was mutated to alanine by the polymerase chain reaction, and the T7-RNA polymerase-transcribed construct containing the mutant sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli. The mutant and wild-type forms of the enzyme were purified to homogeneity, and their specific activity, substrate dependence, and inhibition by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and AMP were compared. While the mutant exhibited no change in maximal velocity, its Km for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate was 20-fold higher than that of the wild-type, and its Ki for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was increased 1000-fold. Consistent with the unaltered maximal velocity, there were no apparent difference between the secondary structure of the wild-type and mutant enzyme forms, as measured by circular dichroism and ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. The Ki for the allosteric inhibitor AMP was only slightly increased, indicating that Lys274 is not directly involved in AMP inhibition. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate potentiated AMP inhibition of both forms, but 500-fold higher concentrations of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were needed to reduce the Ki for AMP for the mutant compared to the wild-type. However, potentiation of AMP inhibition of the Lys274----Ala mutant was evident at fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentrations (approximately 100 microM) well below those that inhibited the enzyme, which suggests that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate interacts either with the AMP site directly or with other residues involved in the active site-AMP synergy. The results also demonstrate that although Lys274 is an important binding site determinant for sugar bisphosphates, it plays a more significant role in binding fructose 2,6-bisphosphate than fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, probably because it binds the 2-phospho group of the former while other residues bind the 1-phospho group of the substrate. It is concluded that the enzyme utilizes Lys274 to discriminate between its substrate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1661899502,"The intracellular processing of the murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein precursor Pr85 to the mature products gp70 and p15e was analyzed in the mouse T-lymphoma cell line W7MG1. Kinetic (pulse-chase) analysis of synthesis and processing, coupled with endoglycosidase (endo H) and neuraminidase digestions revealed the existence of a novel high molecular weight processing intermediate, gp95, containing endo H-resistant terminally glycosylated oligosaccharide chains. In contrast to previously published conclusions, our data indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the envelope precursor occurs after the acquisition of endo H-resistant chains and terminal glycosylation and thus after the mannosidase II step. In the same W7MG1 cell line, the type and order of murine leukemia virus envelope protein processing events was identical to that for the mouse mammary tumor virus envelope protein. Interestingly, complete mouse mammary tumor virus envelope protein processing requires the addition of glucocorticoid hormone, whereas murine leukemia virus envelope protein processing occurs constitutively in these W7MG1 cells. We propose that all retroviral envelope proteins share a common processing pathway in which proteolytic processing is a late event that follows acquisition of endo H resistance and terminal glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1583022528,"H+,K(+)-ATPase, Na+,K(+)-ATPase, and Ca(2+)-ATPase belong to the P-type ATPase group. Their molecular mechanisms of energy transduction have been thought to be similar until now. Ca(2+)-ATPase and Na+,K(+)-ATPase are phosphorylated from both ATP and acetyl phosphate (ACP) and dephosphorylated, resulting in active ion transport. However, we found that H+,K(+)-ATPase did not transport proton nor K+ when ACP was used as a substrate, resulting in uncoupling between energy and ion transport. ACP bound competitively to the ATP-binding site of H+,K(+)-ATPase. The hydrolysis of ACP by H+,K(+)-ATPase was stimulated by cytosolic K+, the half-maximal stimulating K+ concentration (K0.5) being 2.5 mM, whereas the hydrolysis of ATP was stimulated by luminal K+, the K0.5 being 0.2 mM. Furthermore, during the phosphorylation from ACP in the absence of K+, the fluorescence intensity of H+,K(+)-ATPase labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate increased, but those of Na+,K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase decreased. These results indicate that phosphorylated intermediates of H+,K(+)-ATPase formed from ACP are not rich in energy and that there is a striking difference(s) in the mechanism of energy transduction between H+,K(+)-ATPase and other cation-transporting ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W305499504,"The pH dependence of myo-inositol monophosphatase may indicate a role for histidine residues in the catalytic mechanism (Ganzhorn, A. J., and Chanal, M.-C. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 6065-6071). This possibility was investigated by chemical modification. At pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C, the enzyme was inactivated by diethylpyrocarbonate in a pseudo-first order reaction with a bimolecular rate constant of 0.37 M-1 s-1. Two histidines were modified rapidly with no effect on enzyme activity, while 3 residues were modified at a slower rate corresponding to the rate of inactivation. No noticeable changes in the secondary structure of the enzyme were observed by comparison of circular dichroic spectra before and after modification. Treatment of myo-inositol monophosphatase with diethylpyrocarbonate in the presence of inositol 1-phosphate, Mg2+, and Li+ protected 2 residues from modification and decreased the inactivation rate by about 5-fold. Spectrophotometric analysis, the restoration of enzyme activity by hydroxylamine, and the lack of any inhibitory effect with alkylating agents suggest that inactivation is due solely to modification of histidine. We conclude that a histidine residue is essential for activity and may act as a base catalyst during hydrolysis of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1531831633,"Thrombomodulin is an endothelial glycoprotein that serves as a cofactor for protein C activation. To examine the ligand specificity of human thrombomodulin, we performed equilibrium binding assays with human thrombin, thrombin S205A (wherein the active site serine is replaced by alanine), meizothrombin S205A, and human factor Xa. In competition binding assays with CV-1(18A) cells expressing cell surface recombinant human thrombomodulin, recombinant wild type thrombin and thrombin S205A inhibited 125I-diisopropyl fluorophosphate-thrombin binding with similar affinity (Kd = 6.4 +/- 0.5 and 5.3 +/- 0.3 nM, respectively). However, no binding inhibition was detected for meizothrombin S205A or human factor Xa (Kd greater than 500 nM). In direct binding assays, 125I-labeled plasma thrombin and thrombin S205A bound to thrombomodulin with Kd values of 4.0 +/- 1.9 and 6.9 +/- 1.2 nM, respectively. 125I-Labeled meizothrombin S205A and human factor Xa did not bind to thrombomodulin (Kd greater than 500 nM). We also compared the ability of thrombin and factor Xa to activate human recombinant protein C. The activation of recombinant protein C by thrombin was greatly enhanced in the presence of thrombomodulin, whereas no significant activation by factor Xa was detected with or without thrombomodulin. Similar results were obtained with thrombin and factor Xa when human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used as the source of thrombomodulin. These results suggest that human meizothrombin and factor Xa are unlikely to be important thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activators and that thrombin is the physiological ligand for human endothelial cell thrombomodulin."
