https://openalex.org/W2169714942,"G protein-coupled receptors mediate responses to a myriad of ligands, some of which regulate adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. The sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 are G protein-coupled receptors that function as carbohydrate sensors in taste buds, gut, and pancreas. Here we report that sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 are expressed throughout adipogenesis and in adipose tissues. Treatment of mouse and human precursor cells with artificial sweeteners, saccharin and acesulfame potassium, enhanced adipogenesis. Saccharin treatment of 3T3-L1 cells and primary mesenchymal stem cells rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and downstream targets with functions in adipogenesis such as cAMP-response element-binding protein and FOXO1; however, increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α was not observed until relatively late in differentiation. Saccharin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Thr-308 occurred within 5 min, was phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent, and occurred in the presence of high concentrations of insulin and dexamethasone; phosphorylation of Ser-473 occurred more gradually. Surprisingly, neither saccharin-stimulated adipogenesis nor Thr-308 phosphorylation was dependent on expression of T1R2 and/or T1R3, although Ser-473 phosphorylation was impaired in T1R2/T1R3 double knock-out precursors. In mature adipocytes, artificial sweetener treatment suppressed lipolysis even in the presence of forskolin, and lipolytic responses were correlated with phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase. Suppression of lipolysis by saccharin in adipocytes was also independent of T1R2 and T1R3. These results suggest that some artificial sweeteners have previously uncharacterized metabolic effects on adipocyte differentiation and metabolism and that effects of artificial sweeteners on adipose tissue biology may be largely independent of the classical sweet taste receptors, T1R2 and T1R3."
https://openalex.org/W1988437811,"The clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, vary considerably in different patients, possibly due to infection by strains with varying pathogenicity. Both rRNA intergenic spacer and ospC typing methods have proven to be useful tools for categorizing B. burgdorferi strains that vary in their tendency to disseminate in humans. Neither method, however, is suitable for inferring intraspecific relationships among strains that are important for understanding the evolution of pathogenicity and the geographic spread of disease. In this study, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to investigate the population structure of B. burgdorferi recovered from human Lyme disease patients. A total of 146 clinical isolates from patients in New York and Wisconsin were divided into 53 sequence types (STs). A goeBURST analysis, that also included previously published STs from the northeastern and upper Midwestern US and adjoining areas of Canada, identified 11 major and 3 minor clonal complexes, as well as 14 singletons. The data revealed that patients from New York and Wisconsin were infected with two distinct, but genetically and phylogenetically closely related, populations of B. burgdorferi. Importantly, the data suggest the existence of B. burgdorferi lineages with differential capabilities for dissemination in humans. Interestingly, the data also indicate that MLST is better able to predict the outcome of localized or disseminated infection than is ospC typing."
https://openalex.org/W1966315970,"Modeling work suggests that population size affects cultural evolution such that larger populations can be expected to have richer and more complex cultural repertoires than smaller populations. Empirical tests of this hypothesis, however, have yielded conflicting results. Here, we report a study in which we investigated whether the subsistence toolkits of small-scale food-producers are influenced by population size in the manner the hypothesis predicts. We applied simple linear and standard multiple regression analysis to data from 40 nonindustrial farming and pastoralist groups to test the hypothesis. Results were consistent with predictions of the hypothesis: both the richness and the complexity of the toolkits of the food-producers were positively and significantly influenced by population size in the simple linear regression analyses. The multiple regression analyses demonstrated that these relationships are independent of the effects of risk of resource failure, which is the other main factor that has been found to influence toolkit richness and complexity in nonindustrial groups. Thus, our study strongly suggests that population size influences cultural evolution in nonindustrial food-producing populations."
https://openalex.org/W2024335618,"Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are involved in the metabolism of glycoconjugates, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides and, in the case of plant pathogens, in the degradation of the host cell wall and storage compounds. We performed an in silico analysis of CAZymes predicted from the genomes of seven Pythium species (Py. aphanidermatum, Py. arrhenomanes, Py. irregulare, Py. iwayamai, Py. ultimum var. ultimum, Py. ultimum var. sporangiiferum and Py. vexans) using the “CAZymes Analysis Toolkit” and “Database for Automated Carbohydrate-active Enzyme Annotation” and compared them to previously published oomycete genomes. Growth of Pythium spp. was assessed in a minimal medium containing selected carbon sources that are usually present in plants. The in silico analyses, coupled with our in vitro growth assays, suggest that most of the predicted CAZymes are involved in the metabolism of the oomycete cell wall with starch and sucrose serving as the main carbohydrate sources for growth of these plant pathogens. The genomes of Pythium spp. also encode pectinases and cellulases that facilitate degradation of the plant cell wall and are important in hyphal penetration; however, the species examined in this study lack the requisite genes for the complete saccharification of these carbohydrates for use as a carbon source. Genes encoding for xylan, xyloglucan, (galacto)(gluco)mannan and cutin degradation were absent or infrequent in Pythium spp.. Comparative analyses of predicted CAZymes in oomycetes indicated distinct evolutionary histories. Furthermore, CAZyme gene families among Pythium spp. were not uniformly distributed in the genomes, suggesting independent gene loss events, reflective of the polyphyletic relationships among some of the species."
https://openalex.org/W1979486670,"In bone, depletion of osteoclasts reduces bone formation in vivo, as does osteal macrophage depletion. How osteoclasts and macrophages promote the action of bone forming osteoblasts is, however, unclear. Since recruitment and differentiation of multi-potential stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) generates new active osteoblasts, we investigated whether human osteoclasts and macrophages (generated from cord blood-derived hematopoietic progenitors) induce osteoblastic maturation in adipose tissue-derived MSC. When treated with an osteogenic stimulus (ascorbate, dexamethasone and β-glycerophosphate) these MSC form matrix-mineralising, alkaline phosphatase-expressing osteoblastic cells. Cord blood-derived progenitors were treated with macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) to form immature proliferating macrophages, or with M-CSF plus receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) to form osteoclasts; culture medium was conditioned for 3 days by these cells to study their production of osteoblastic factors. Both osteoclast- and macrophage-conditioned medium (CM) greatly enhanced MSC osteoblastic differentiation in both the presence and absence of osteogenic medium, evident by increased alkaline phosphatase levels within 4 days and increased mineralisation within 14 days. These CM effects were completely ablated by antibodies blocking gp130 or oncostatin M (OSM), and OSM was detectable in both CM. Recombinant OSM very potently stimulated osteoblastic maturation of these MSC and enhanced bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) actions on MSC. To determine the influence of macrophage activation on this OSM-dependent activity, CM was collected from macrophage populations treated with M-CSF plus IL-4 (to induce alternative activation) or with GM-CSF, IFNγ and LPS to cause classical activation. CM from IL-4 treated macrophages stimulated osteoblastic maturation in MSC, while CM from classically-activated macrophages did not. Thus, macrophage-lineage cells, including osteoclasts but not classically activated macrophages, can strongly drive MSC-osteoblastic commitment in OSM-dependent manner. This supports the notion that eliciting gp130-dependent signals in human MSC would be a useful approach to increase bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2013617101,"Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor with significant antineoplastic activity for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma as well as other hematological and solid neoplasms. Peripheral neurological complications manifesting with paresthesias, burning sensations, dysesthesias, numbness, sensory loss, reduced proprioception and vibratory sensitivity are among the major limiting side effects associated with bortezomib therapy. Although bortezomib-induced painful peripheral neuropathy is clinically easy to diagnose and reliable models are available, its pathophysiology remains partly unclear. In this study we used well-characterized immune-competent and immune-compromised mouse models of bortezomib-induced painful peripheral neuropathy. To characterize the drug-induced pathological changes in the peripheral nervous system, we examined the involvement of spinal cord neuronal function in the development of neuropathic pain and investigated the relevance of the immune response in painful peripheral neuropathy induced by bortezomib. We found that bortezomib treatment induced morphological changes in the spinal cord, dorsal roots, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and peripheral nerves. Neurophysiological abnormalities and specific functional alterations in Aδ and C fibers were also observed in peripheral nerve fibers. Mice developed mechanical allodynia and functional abnormalities of wide dynamic range neurons in the dorsal horn of spinal cord. Bortezomib induced increased expression of the neuronal stress marker activating transcription factor-3 in most DRG. Moreover, the immunodeficient animals treated with bortezomib developed a painful peripheral neuropathy with the same features observed in the immunocompetent mice. In conclusion, this study extends the knowledge of the sites of damage induced in the nervous system by bortezomib administration. Moreover, a selective functional vulnerability of peripheral nerve fiber subpopulations was found as well as a change in the electrical activity of wide dynamic range neurons of dorsal horn of spinal cord. Finally, the immune response is not a key factor in the development of morphological and functional damage induced by bortezomib in the peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2127511653,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with abnormal prefrontal-limbic interactions and altered catecholaminergic neurotransmission. The val158met polymorphism on the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene has been shown to influence prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during both emotional processing and working memory (WM). Although COMT-genotype is not directly associated with MDD, it may affect MDD pathology by altering PFC activation, an endophenotype associated with both COMT and MDD. 125 participants, including healthy controls (HC, n=28) and MDD patients were genotyped for the COMT val158met polymorphism and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-neuroimaging) during emotion processing (viewing of emotional facial expressions) and a WM task (visuospatial planning). Within HC, we observed a positive correlation between the number of met-alleles and right inferior frontal gyrus activation during emotional processing, whereas within patients the number of met-alleles was not correlated with PFC activation. During WM a negative correlation between the number of met-alleles and middle frontal gyrus activation was present in the total sample. In addition, during emotional processing there was an effect of genotype in a cluster including the amygdala and hippocampus. These results demonstrate that COMT genotype is associated with relevant endophenotypes for MDD. In addition, presence of MDD only interacts with genotype during emotional processing and not working memory."
https://openalex.org/W2149751073,"Administration of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) improves functional outcome in the SOD1G93A mouse model of the degenerative motor neuron disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as well as in models of other neurological disorders. We have now investigated the effect of the interaction between MSC and motor neurons (derived from both non-transgenic and mutant SOD1G93A transgenic mice), NSC-34 cells and glial cells (astrocytes, microglia) (derived again from both non-transgenic and mutant SOD1G93A ALS transgenic mice) in vitro. In primary motor neurons, NSC-34 cells and astrocytes, MSC conditioned medium (MSC CM) attenuated staurosporine (STS) - induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Studying MSC CM-induced expression of neurotrophic factors in astrocytes and NSC-34 cells, we found that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) gene expression in astrocytes were significantly enhanced by MSC CM, with differential responses of non-transgenic and mutant astrocytes. Expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in NSC-34 cells was significantly upregulated upon MSC CM-treatment. MSC CM significantly reduced the expression of the cytokines TNFα and IL-6 and iNOS both in transgenic and non-transgenic astrocytes. Gene expression of the neuroprotective chemokine Fractalkine (CX3CL1) was also upregulated in mutant SOD1G93A transgenic astrocytes by MSC CM treatment. Correspondingly, MSC CM increased the respective receptor, CX3CR1, in mutant SOD1G93A transgenic microglia. Our data demonstrate that MSC modulate motor neuronal and glial response to apoptosis and inflammation. MSC therefore represent an interesting candidate for further preclinical and clinical evaluation in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W2067780085,"Mitogenomes can provide information for phylogenetic analyses and evolutionary biology. The complete mitochondrial genome of Amata emma (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) was sequenced and analyzed in the study. The circular genome is 15,463 bp in size, with the gene content, orientation and order identical to other ditrysian insects. The genome composition of the major strand shows highly A+T biased and exhibits negative AT-skew and GC-skew. The initial codons are the canonical putative start codons ATN with the exception of cox1 gene which uses CGA instead. Ten genes share complete termination codons TAA, and three genes use incomplete stop codons TA or T. Additionally, the codon distribution and Relative Synonymous Codon Usage of the 13 PCGs in the A. emma mitogenome are consistent with those in other Noctuid mitogenomes. All tRNA genes have typical cloverleaf secondary structures, except for the trnS1 (AGN) gene, in which the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm is simplified down to a loop. The secondary structures of two rRNA genes broadly conform with the models proposed for these genes of other Lepidopteran insects. Except for the A+T-rich region, there are three major intergenic spacers, spanning at least 10 bp and five overlapping regions. There are obvious differences in the A+T-rich region between A. emma and other Lepidopteran insects reported previously except that the A+T-rich region contains an ‘ATAGA’ -like motif followed by a 19 bp poly-T stretch and a (AT)9 element preceded by the ‘ATTTA’ motif. It neither has a poly-A (in the α strand) upstream trnM nor potential stem-loop structures and just has some simple structures like (AT)nGTAT. The phylogenetic relationships based on nucleotide sequences of 13 PCGs using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods provided a well-supported a broader outline of Lepidoptera and which agree with the traditional morphological classification and recently working, but with a much higher support."
https://openalex.org/W2091105023,"Lactobacillus sakei plays a major role in meat fermentation and in the preservation of fresh meat. The large diversity of L. sakei strains represents a valuable and exploitable asset in the development of a variety of industrial applications; however, an efficient method to identify and classify these strains has yet to be developed. In this study, we used multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to analyze the polymorphism and allelic distribution of eight loci within an L. sakei population of 232 strains collected worldwide. Within this population, we identified 116 unique sequence types with an average pairwise nucleotide diversity per site (π) of 0.13%. Results from Structure, goeBurst, and ClonalFrame software analyses demonstrated that the L. sakei population analyzed here is derived from three ancestral lineages, each of which shows evidence of a unique evolutionary history influenced by independent selection scenarios. However, the signature of selective events in the contemporary population of isolates was somewhat masked by the pervasive phenomenon of homologous recombination. Our results demonstrate that lineage 1 is a completely panmictic subpopulation in which alleles have been continually redistributed through the process of intra-lineage recombination. In contrast, lineage 2 was characterized by a high degree of clonality. Lineage 3, the earliest-diverging branch in the genealogy, showed evidence of both clonality and recombination. These evolutionary histories strongly indicate that the three lineages may correspond to distinct ecotypes, likely linked or specialized to different environmental reservoirs. The MLST scheme developed in this study represents an easy and straightforward tool that can be used to further analyze the population dynamics of L. sakei strains in food products."
https://openalex.org/W2084671501,"Neurodegeneration together with a reduction in neurogenesis are cardinal features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) induced by a combination of toxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and a loss of trophic factor support. Amelioration of these was assessed with diverse neurotrophins in experimental therapeutic approaches. The aim of this study was to investigate whether intranasal delivery of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret), an autologous pool of morphogens and proteins, could enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and reduce neurodegeneration in an amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mouse model. Neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions were firstly evident in primary neuronal cultures, where cell proliferation and survival were augmented by Endoret treatment. Translation of these effects in vivo was assessed in wild type and APP/PS1 mice, where neurogenesis was evaluated using 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BdrU), doublecortin (DCX), and NeuN immunostaining 5 weeks after Endoret administration. The number of BrdU, DCX, and NeuN positive cell was increased after chronic treatment. The number of degenerating neurons, detected with fluoro Jade-B staining was reduced in Endoret-treated APP/PS1 mice at 5 week after intranasal administration. In conclusion, Endoret was able to activate neuronal progenitor cells, enhancing hippocampal neurogenesis, and to reduce Aβ-induced neurodegeneration in a mouse model of AD."

Here we analyze the transcriptomes of 55 leukemia samples to identify the most consistent genes. This list is enriched for components of the proteasome (ex. PSMA1) and spliceosome (ex. SF3B2), and also includes the translation initiation factor EIF4H, and many heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein genes (ex. HNRNPL).

WINROP signals with an alarm to indicate if the preterm infant is at risk for ROP type 1.In this extremely preterm population, WINROP correctly identified 96% (45/47) of the infants who required treatment for ROP type 1. The median time from alarm to treatment was 9 weeks (range, 4-20 weeks).WINROP, an online surveillance system using weekly weight gain, identified extremely preterm infants at risk for ROP type 1 requiring treatment at an early stage and with high sensitivity in a Swedish nation-based cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2028038938,"networks of switches) are extremely simple mathematical models of biochemical signaling networks. Under certain circumstances, Boolean networks, despite their simplicity, are capable of predicting dynamical activation patterns of gene regulatory networks in living cells. For example, the temporal sequence of cell cycle activation patterns in yeasts S. pombe and S. cerevisiae are faithfully reproduced by Boolean network models. An interesting question is whether this simple model class could also predict a more complex cellular phenomenology as, for example, the cell cycle dynamics under various knockout mutants instead of the wild type dynamics, only. Here we show that a Boolean network model for the cell cycle control network of yeast S. pombe correctly predicts viability of a large number of known mutants. So far this had been left to the more detailed differential equation models of the biochemical kinetics of the yeast cell cycle network and was commonly thought to be out of reach for models as simplistic as Boolean networks. The new results support our vision that Boolean networks may complement other mathematical models in systems biology to a larger extent than expected so far, and may fill a gap where simplicity of the model and a preference for an overall dynamical blueprint of cellular regulation, instead of biochemical details, are in the focus."
https://openalex.org/W2062375688,"The rate at which mutations are generated is central to the pace of evolution. Although this rate is remarkably similar amongst all cellular organisms, bacterial strains with mutation rates 100 fold greater than the modal rates of their species are commonly isolated from natural sources and emerge in experimental populations. Theoretical studies postulate and empirical studies teort the hypotheses that these ""mutator"" strains evolved in response to selection for elevated rates of generation of inherited variation that enable bacteria to adapt to novel and/or rapidly changing environments. Less clear are the conditions under which selection will favor reductions in mutation rates. Declines in rates of mutation for established populations of mutator bacteria are not anticipated if such changes are attributed to the costs of augmented rates of generation of deleterious mutations. Here we report experimental evidence of evolution towards reduced mutation rates in a clinical isolate of Escherichia coli with an hyper-mutable phenotype due a deletion in a mismatch repair gene, (ΔmutS). The emergence in a ΔmutS background of variants with mutation rates approaching those of the normal rates of strains carrying wild-type MutS was associated with increase in fitness with respect to ancestral strain. We postulate that such an increase in fitness could be attributed to the emergence of mechanisms driving a permanent ""aerobic style of life"", the negative consequence of this behavior being regulated by the evolution of mechanisms protecting the cell against increased endogenous oxidative radicals involved in DNA damage, and thus reducing mutation rate. Gene expression assays and full sequencing of evolved mutator and normo-mutable variants supports the hypothesis. In conclusion, we postulate that the observed reductions in mutation rate are coincidental to, rather than, the selective force responsible for this evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2050255768,"Zona pellucida (ZP) is an extracellular matrix surrounding and protecting mammalian and fish oocytes, which is responsible for sperm binding. Mammalian ZP consists of three to four glycoproteins, called ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, ZP4. These proteins polymerize into long interconnected filaments, through a common structural unit, known as the ZP domain, which consists of two domains, ZP-N and ZP-C. ZP is related in function to silkmoth chorion and in an evolutionary fashion to the teleostean fish chorion, also fibrous structures protecting the oocyte and embryo, that both have been proven to be functional amyloids. Two peptides were predicted as ‘aggregation-prone’ by our prediction tool, AMYLPRED, from the sequence of the human ZP1-N domain. Here, we present results from transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Congo red staining and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR), of two synthetic peptide-analogues of these predicted ‘aggregation-prone’ parts of the human ZP1-N domain, that we consider crucial for ZP protein polymerization, showing that they both self-assemble into amyloid-like fibrils. Based on our experimental data, we propose that human ZP (hZP) might be considered as a novel, putative, natural protective amyloid, in close analogy to silkmoth and teleostean fish chorions. Experiments are in progress to verify this proposal. We also attempt to provide insights into ZP formation, proposing a possible model for hZP1-N domain polymerization."

The intervention consisted of two parts: (a) online screening and personalised feedback on impaired WF and MH, followed by (b) a tailored offer of self-help EMH interventions. CG received none of these parts. Primary outcome was impaired WF (Nurses Work Functioning Questionnaire), assessed at baseline and after three and six months. Analyses were performed in the positively screened subgroup (i) and in all participants (ii).Participation rate at baseline was 32% (NIG = 178; NCG = 188). Eighty-two percent screened positive for at least mild impairments in WF and/or MH (NIG = 139; NCG = 161). All IG-participants (N = 178) received part (a) of the intervention, nine participants (all positively screened, 6%) followed an EMH intervention to at least some extent. Regarding the subgroup of positively screened participants (i), both IG and CG improved over time regarding WF (non-significant between-group difference). After six months, 36% of positively screened IG-participants (18/50) had a relevant WF improvement compared to baseline, versus 28% (32/115) of positively screened CG-participants (non-significant difference). In the complete sample (ii), IG and CG improved over time but IG further improved between three and six months while CG did not (significant interaction effect).In our study with a full compliance rate of 6% and substantial drop-out leading to a small and underpowered sample, we could not demonstrate that an EMH-approach to WHS is more effective to improve WF and MH than a control group.

The numerical results are also compared with the existing theoretical models and the differences are discussed. Our experimental and computed results show a minimum burst frequency occurring at square capillaries and this result is useful for designing and developing more sophisticated networks of capillary valves.

However, it is still unclear how mitochondrial defects arise under normal physiological conditions. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions caused by direct repeats (DRs) are implicated in the formation of mitochondrial defects, however, mitochondrial DRs show relatively weak (Pearson’s r = −0.22, p<0.002; Spearman’s ρ = −0.12, p = 0.1) correlation with maximum lifespan (MLS). Here we report a stronger correlation (Pearson’s r = −0.55, p<10–16; Spearman’s ρ = −0.52, p<10–14) between mitochondrial inverted repeats (IRs) and lifespan across 202 species of mammals. We show that, in wild type mice under normal conditions, IRs cause inversions, which arise by replication-dependent mechanism. The inversions accumulate with age in the brain and heart. Our data suggest that IR-mediated inversions are more mutagenic than DR-mediated deletions in mtDNA, and impose stronger constraint on lifespan. Our study identifies IR-induced mitochondrial genome instability during mtDNA replication as a potential cause for mitochondrial defects."
https://openalex.org/W2043328653,"Background In Taiwan, oral cancer has causally been associated with environmental carcinogens. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, a cell adhesion molecule with a key role in inflammation and immunosurveillance, was implicated in carcinogenesis by facilitating instability in the tumor environment. The current study explored the combined effect of ICAM-1 gene polymorphisms and exposure to environmental carcinogens on the susceptibility of developing oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors. Methodology and Principal Findings Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ICAM-1 gene from 595 patients with oral cancer and 561 non-cancer controls were analyzed by a real-time PCR. We found that the ICAM-1 rs5498 polymorphism and the TAGG or TACG haplotype of 4 ICAM-1 SNPs (rs3093030, rs5491, rs281432, and rs5498) combined were associated with oral-cancer susceptibility. Among 727 smokers, ICAM-1 polymorphisms carriers with the betel-nut chewing habit had a 27.49–36.23-fold greater risk of having oral cancer compared to ICAM-1 wild-type (WT) carriers without the betel-nut chewing habit. Among 549 betel-nut chewers, ICAM-1 polymorphisms carriers who smoked had a 9.93–14.27-fold greater risk of having oral cancer compared to those who carried the WT but did not smoke. Finally, patients with oral cancer who had at least 1 T allele of ICAM-1 rs5491 or 1 G allele of rs281432 were at lower risk of developing an advanced clinical stage (III/IV) (p<0.05), compared to those patients with AA or CC homozygotes. Conclusions Our results suggest that the ICAM-1 rs5498 SNP and either of 2 haplotypes of 4 SNPs combined have potential predictive significance in oral carcinogenesis. Gene-environment interactions of ICAM-1 polymorphisms, smoking, and betel-nut chewing might alter oral-cancer susceptibility. ICAM-1 rs5491 and rs281432 may be applied as factors to predict the clinical stage in OSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2056287310,"The spatiotemporal and longitudinal monitoring of cellular processes occurring in tumors is critical for oncological research. We focused on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an untreatable highly vascularized brain tumor whose progression is thought to critically depend on the oxygen and metabolites supplied by blood vessels. We optimized protocols for orthotopic GBM grafting in mice that were able to recapitulate the biophysical constraints normally governing tumor progression and were suitable for intravital multiphoton microscopy. We repeatedly imaged tumor cells and blood vessels during GBM development. We established methods for quantitative correlative analyses of dynamic imaging data over wide fields in order to cover the entire tumor. We searched whether correlations existed between blood vessel density, tumor cell density and proliferation in control tumors. Extensive vascular remodeling and the formation of new vessels accompanied U87 tumor cell growth, but no strong correlation was found between local cell density and the extent of local blood vessel density irrespective of the tumor area or time points. The technique moreover proves useful for comparative analysis of mice subjected either to Bevacizumab anti-angiogenic treatment that targets VEGF or to AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCR4 receptor. Bevacizumab treatment massively reduced tumoral vessel densities but only transiently reduced U87 tumor growth rate. Again, there was no correlation between local blood vessel density and local cell density. Moreover, Bev applied only prior to tumor implantation inhibited tumor growth to the same extent as post-grafting treatment. AMD3100 achieved a potent inhibition of tumor growth without significant reduction in blood vessel density. These results indicate that in the brain, in this model, tumor growth can be sustained without an increase in blood vessel density and suggest that GBM growth is rather governed by stromal properties."

From 2007 through 2010, we surveyed the vancomycin susceptibility of methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA, respectively) clinical isolates in Northeast China.S. aureus clinical isolates (369 MRSA and 388 MSSA) were screened for hVISA and VISA on brain heart infusion agar containing 3 μg/mL vancomycin, and their identity confirmed using a modified population analysis profile-area under the curve method and broth microdilution. All hVISA and VISA isolates were characterized genotypically and phenotypically.Ten percent and 0.5 percent of the isolates were hVISA and VISA, respectively. The proportion of hVISA among MSSA isolates for the entire study period was 4.1%, but increased significantly year-by-year, from 1.2% in 2007 to 7.2% in 2010. The predominant sources of hVISA and VISA isolates were sputum (56.3%), pus (18.8%), and blood (8.8%). Molecular typing of hVISA and VISA strains revealed that, taken together, 80% contained the accessory gene regulator (agr) group II, and of these, 85.7% of the MR-hVISA and MR-VISA strains were staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type II. The adherence ability of all hVISA and VISA strains was reduced compared with that of vancomycin-susceptible strains, shown by biofilm assay.The percentage of hVISA strains was high and increased each year. The proportion of hVISA among MSSA specifically also increased significantly each year. In isolates collected from diverse infection sites, hVISA and VISA strains were found predominantly in sputum, pus, and blood, in descending order. Testing for vancomycin susceptibility should include both MRSA and MSSA isolates collected from different clinical sites."
https://openalex.org/W2014213740,"Changes in immune response during lifespan of man are well known. These changes involve decreased neonatal and elderly immune response. In addition, it has been shown a relationship between immune and oxidative mechanisms, suggesting that altered immune response could be associated to altered oxidative response. Increased expression of nitric oxide (NO) has been documented in dengue and in monocyte cultures infected with different types of dengue virus. However, there is no information about the age-dependent NO oxidative response in humans infected by dengue virus. In this study, monocyte cultures from neonatal, elderly and adult individuals (n = 10 each group) were infected with different dengue virus types (DENV- 1 to 4) and oxidative/antioxidative responses and apoptosis were measured at days 1 and 3 of culture. Increased production of NO, lipid peroxidation and enzymatic and nonenzymatic anti-oxidative responses in dengue infected monocyte cultures were observed. However, neonatal and elderly monocytes had lower values of studied parameters when compared to those in adult-derived cultures. Apoptosis was present in infected monocytes with higher values at day 3 of culture. This reduced oxidant/antioxidant response of neonatal and elderly monocytes could be relevant in the pathogenesis of dengue disease."
https://openalex.org/W2085930009,"Our appearance changes over time, yet we can recognize ourselves in photographs from across the lifespan. Researchers have extensively studied self-recognition in photographs and have proposed that specific neural correlates are involved, but few studies have examined self-recognition using images from different periods of life. Here we compared ERP responses to photographs of participants when they were 5–15, 16–25, and 26–45 years old. We found marked differences between the responses to photographs from these time periods in terms of the neural markers generally assumed to reflect (i) the configural processing of faces (i.e., the N170), (ii) the matching of the currently perceived face to a representation already stored in memory (i.e., the P250), and (iii) the retrieval of information about the person being recognized (i.e., the N400). There was no uniform neural signature of visual self-recognition. To test whether there was anything specific to self-recognition in these brain responses, we also asked participants to identify photographs of their dizygotic twins taken from the same time periods. Critically, this allowed us to minimize the confounding effects of exposure, for it is likely that participants have been similarly exposed to each other's faces over the lifespan. The same pattern of neural response emerged with only one exception: the neural marker reflecting the retrieval of mnemonic information (N400) differed across the lifespan for self but not for twin. These results, as well as our novel approach using twins and photographs from across the lifespan, have wide-ranging consequences for the study of self-recognition and the nature of our personal identity through time."
https://openalex.org/W2007493283,"The intestinal mucosa is a monolayer of rapidly self-renewing epithelial cells which is not only responsible for absorption of water and nutrients into the bloodstream but also acts as a protective barrier against harmful microbes entering the body. New functional epithelial cells are produced from stem cells, and their proliferating progeny. These stem cells are found within millions of crypts (tubular pits) spaced along the intestinal tract. The entire intestinal epithelium is replaced every 2-3 days in mice (3-5 days in humans) and hence cell production, differentiation, migration and turnover need to be tightly regulated. Malfunctions in this regulation are strongly linked to inflammatory bowel diseases and to the formation of adenomas and ultimately cancerous tumours. Despite a great deal of biological experimentation and observation, precisely how colonic crypts are regulated to produce mature colonocytes remains unclear. To assist in understanding how cell organisation in crypts is achieved, two very different conceptual models of cell behaviour are developed here, referred to as the 'pedigree' and the 'niche' models. The pedigree model proposes that crypt cells are largely preprogrammed and receive minimal prompting from the environment as they move through a routine of cell differentiation and proliferation to become mature colonocytes. The niche model proposes that crypt cells are primarily influenced by the local microenvironments along the crypt, and that predetermined cell behaviour plays a negligible role in their development. In this paper we present a computational model of colonic crypts in the mouse, which enables a comparison of the quality and controllability of mature coloncyte production by crypts operating under these two contrasting conceptual models of crypt regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2010197516,"Plain pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPS) booster administered during second year of life has been shown to cause hyporesponsiveness. We assessed the effects of PPS booster on splenic memory B cell responses and persistence of PPS-specific long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM).Neonatal mice were primed subcutanously (s.c.) or intranasally (i.n.) with pneumococcal conjugate (Pnc1-TT) and the adjuvant LT-K63, and boosted with PPS+LT-K63 or saline 1, 2 or 3 times with 16 day intervals. Seven days after each booster, spleens were removed, germinal centers (GC), IgM(+), IgG(+) follicles and PPS-specific antibody secreting cells (AbSC) in spleen and BM enumerated.PPS booster s.c., but not i.n., compromised the Pnc1-TT-induced PPS-specific Abs by abrogating the Pnc1-TT-induced GC reaction and depleting PPS-specific AbSCs in spleen and limiting their homing to the BM. There was no difference in the frequency of PPS-specific AbSCs in spleen and BM between mice that received 1, 2 or 3 PPS boosters s.c.. Repeated PPS+LT-K63 booster i.n. reduced the frequency of PPS-specific IgG(+) AbSCs in BM.PPS booster-induced hyporesponsiveness is caused by abrogation of conjugate-induced GC reaction and depletion of PPS-specific IgG(+) AbSCs resulting in no homing of new PPS-specific long-lived plasma cells to the BM or survival. These results should be taken into account in design of vaccination schedules where polysaccharides are being considered."
https://openalex.org/W2171551521,"Insects pinpoint mates, food and oviposition sites by olfactory cues. Recognizing and localizing a suitable target by olfaction is demanding. Odor sources emit characteristic blends of compounds that have to be identified against an environmentally derived olfactory background. This background, however, does not necessarily disturb the localization of a source. Rather, the contrary. Sex pheromones become more attractive to male moths when being presented against a relevant plant background. Here we asked whether such olfactory coaction also characterizes foraging cues. The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta feeds on nectar from wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata and sacred datura Datura wrightii flowers. We tested how leaf-derived volatile blends as a background affect the moths' approach to flower blends. We found coaction when a flower blend was presented against a conspecific leaf volatile background but not when the blend was presented against volatiles emitted by the other host plant or by a non-host plant. Hence, our results reveal a species-specific coaction between flower blend and leaf volatile background. The ability to integrate information from different odor sources on one plant might provide the moth with a fine-grained analysis of food site quality."
https://openalex.org/W1995516378,"Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and nephronophthisis (NPH) are hereditary autosomal recessive disorders, encoded by two families of diverse genes. BBS and NPH display several overlapping phenotypes including cystic kidney disease, retinitis pigmentosa, liver fibrosis, situs inversus and cerebellar defects. Since most of the BBS and NPH proteins localize to cilia and/or their appendages, BBS and NPH are considered ciliopathies. In this study, we characterized the function of the transcription factor Nphp7 in zebrafish, and addressed the molecular connection between BBS and NPH. The knockdown of zebrafish bbs1 and nphp7.2 caused similar phenotypic changes including convergent extension defects, curvature of the body axis, hydrocephalus, abnormal heart looping and cystic pronephros, all consistent with an altered ciliary function. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed a physical interaction between BBS1 and NPHP7, and the simultaneous knockdown of zbbs1 and znphp7.2 enhanced the cystic pronephros phenotype synergistically, suggesting a genetic interaction between zbbs1 and znphp7.2 in vivo. Deletion of zBbs1 or zNphp7.2 did not compromise cilia formation, but disrupted cilia motility. Although NPHP7 has been shown to act as transcriptional repressor, our studies suggest a crosstalk between BBS1 and NPHP7 in regulating normal function of the cilium."
https://openalex.org/W2015937943,"Orienting visual attention is closely linked to the oculomotor system. For example, a shift of attention is usually followed by a saccadic eye movement and can be revealed by micro saccades. Recently we reported a novel role of another type of eye movement, namely eye vergence, in orienting visual attention. Shifts in visuospatial attention are characterized by the response modulation to a selected target. However, unlike (micro-) saccades, eye vergence movements do not carry spatial information (except for depth) and are thus not specific to a particular visual location. To further understand the role of eye vergence in visual attention, we tested subjects with different perceptual styles. Perceptual style refers to the characteristic way individuals perceive environmental stimuli, and is characterized by a spatial difference (local vs. global) in perceptual processing. We tested field independent (local; FI) and field dependent (global; FD) observers in a cue/no-cue task and a matching task. We found that FI observers responded faster and had stronger modulation in eye vergence in both tasks than FD subjects. The results may suggest that eye vergence modulation may relate to the trade-off between the size of spatial region covered by attention and the processing efficiency of sensory information. Alternatively, vergence modulation may have a role in the switch in cortical state to prepare the visual system for new incoming sensory information. In conclusion, vergence eye movements may be added to the growing list of functions of fixational eye movements in visual perception. However, further studies are needed to elucidate its role."
https://openalex.org/W1974799332,"Mushrooms that are morphologically indistinguishable from Russula virescens (Schaeff.) Fr. are among the most popular wild edible mushrooms in Yunnan province, southwestern China. However, almost nothing is known about their biology. This study investigated the diversity and population genetics of a R. virescens ally from Yunnan. A total of 210 samples were collected from 13 geographical locations throughout the main distribution range in Yunnan. The patterns of genetic variation within and among these geographic populations were analyzed using sequences from three nuclear and two mitochondrial DNA fragments. Analysis of the ITS sequences revealed that samples from Yunnan showed 3-6% sequence difference from R. virescens samples from North America and Europe and formed a distinct clade. Our multilocus population genetic analyses suggested frequent gene flow among geographic populations of the R. virescens ally in Yunnan. Interestingly, the nuclear and mitochondrial genes exhibited different levels of gene flow and recombination. We discuss the implications of our results for understanding speciation, reproduction and conservation of this important biological resource."
https://openalex.org/W2114931606,"Background Cell specific states of the chromatin are programmed during mammalian development. Dynamic DNA methylation across the developing embryo guides a program of repression, switching off genes in most cell types. Thus, the majority of the tissue specific differentially methylated sites (TS-DMS) must be un-methylated CpGs. Methodology and Principal Findings Comparison of expanded Methyl Sensitive Cut Counting data (eMSCC) among four tissues (liver, testes, brain and kidney) from three C57BL/6J mice, identified 138,052 differentially methylated sites of which 23,270 contain CpGs un-methylated in only one tissue (TS-DMS). Most of these CpGs were located in intergenic regions, outside of promoters, CpG islands or their shores, and up to 20% of them overlapped reported active enhancers. Indeed, tissue-specific enhancers were up to 30 fold enriched in TS-DMS. Testis showed the highest number of TS-DMS, but paradoxically their associated genes do not appear to be specific to the germ cell functions, but rather are involved in organism development. In the other tissues the differentially methylated genes are associated with tissue-specific physiological or anatomical functions. The identified sets of TS-DMS quantify epigenetic distances between tissues, generated during development. We applied this concept to measure the extent of reprogramming in the liver of mice exposed to in utero or early postnatal nutritional stress. Different protocols of food restriction reprogrammed the liver methylome in different but reproducible ways. Conclusion and Significance Thus, each identified set of differentially methylated sites constituted an epigenetic signature that traced the developmental programing or the early nutritional reprogramming of each exposed mouse. We propose that our approach has the potential to outline a number of disease-associated epigenetic states. The composition of differentially methylated CpGs may vary with each situation, behaving as a composite variable, which can be used as a pre-symptomatic marker for disease."
https://openalex.org/W1995990369,"Background We have recently shown first trimester Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) and Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein-A (PAPP-A) serum concentrations are depressed among asymptomatic women destined to miscarry. Here we examined whether plasma levels of MIC-1 and PAPP-A are depressed among women presenting to an Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit (EPAU), noted to have a confirmed viable fetus, but subsequently miscarry. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study, recruiting 462 women in the first trimester presenting to EPAU and had fetal viability confirmed by ultrasound. We obtained plasma samples on the same day and measured MIC-1, PAPP-A and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), grouping the cohort according to whether they later miscarried or not. To correct for changes in analyte levels across gestation, we expressed the data as Multiples of the normal Median (MoMs). Results We recruited 462 participants presenting to EPAU at 5-12 weeks gestation. Most (80%) presented with symptoms of threatened miscarriage (e.g. abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding). 34 (7.4%) subsequently miscarried. Median plasma MIC-1 levels among those who miscarried were 50% of those with ongoing pregnancies (Miscarriage cohort MoM 0.50 (25th-75th centiles: 0.29-1.33) vs ongoing pregnancies MoM 1.00 (0.65-1.38); p=0.0025). Median plasma PAPP-A MoMs among those who miscarried was 0.57 (0.00-1.12), significantly lower than those with ongoing pregnancies (MoMs 1.00 (0.59-1.59); p=0.036). Plasma hCG levels were also significantly depressed among those who miscarried compared to those with ongoing pregnancies. However, the performance of MIC-1 as a diagnostic marker to predict miscarriage in this cohort was modest, and not improved with the addition of hCG. Conclusion MIC-1 and PAPP-A levels are significantly depressed in women presenting to EPAU with ultrasound evidence of fetal viability, but later miscarry. While they are unlikely to be useful as predictive biomarkers in this clinical setting, they probably play important roles in the maintenance of early pregnancy."

Our previous study in vitro and in nude mice suggested a promotion role of Tiam1 on invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present study, we generated Tiam1/C1199-CopGFP transgenic mice to investigate the tumorigenetic, invasive and metastatic alterations in the colon and rectum of wild-type and Tiam1 transgenic mice under 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) treatment. Methods Transgenic mice were produced by the method of pronuclear microinlectlon. Whole-body fluorescence imaging (Lighttools, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), PCR, and immunohistochemical techniques (IHC) were applied sequentially to identify the transgenic mice. The carcinogen DMH (20 mg/kg) was used to induce colorectal tumors though intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections once a week for 24 weeks from the age of 4 weeks on Tiam1 transgenic or non-transgenic mice. Results We successfully generated Tiam1/C1199-CopGFP transgenic mice and induced primary tumors in the intestine of both wild type and Tiam1 transgenic mice by DMH treatment. In addition, Tiam1 transgenic mice developed larger and more aggressive neoplasm than wild-type mice. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed that upregulation of Tiam1 was correlated with increased expression of β-Catenin and Vimentin, and downregulation of E-Cadherin in these mice. Conclusions Our study has provided in vivo evidence supporting that Tiam1 promotes invasion and metastasis of CRC, most probably through activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, in a Tiam1 transgenic mouse model."
https://openalex.org/W2046511447,"Given the health impacts of smoking during pregnancy and the opportunity for primary healthcare teams to encourage pregnant smokers to quit, our primary aim was to assess the completeness of gestational smoking status recording in primary care data and investigate whether completeness varied with women's characteristics. As a secondary aim we assessed whether completeness of recording varied before and after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF).In The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database we calculated the proportion of pregnancies ending in live births or stillbirths where there was a recording of maternal smoking status for each year from 2000 to 2009. Logistic regression was used to assess variation in the completeness of maternal smoking recording by maternal characteristics, before and after the introduction of QOF.Women had a record of smoking status during the gestational period in 28% of the 277,552 pregnancies identified. In 2000, smoking status was recorded in 9% of pregnancies, rising to 43% in 2009. Pregnant women from the most deprived group were 17% more likely to have their smoking status recorded than pregnant women from the least deprived group before QOF implementation (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.10-1.25) and 42% more likely afterwards (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.37-1.47). A diagnosis of asthma was related to recording of smoking status during pregnancy in both the pre-QOF (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.53-1.74) and post-QOF periods (OR 2.08, 95% CI 2.02-2.15). There was no association between having a diagnosis of diabetes and recording of smoking status during pregnancy pre-QOF however, post-QOF diagnosis of diabetes was associated with a 12% increase in recording of smoking status (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19).Recording of smoking status during pregnancy in primary care data is incomplete though has improved over time, especially after the implementation of the QOF, and varies by maternal characteristics and QOF-incentivised morbidities."
https://openalex.org/W1963724799,"Bone metastases are severely debilitating and have a significant impact on the quality of life of women with metastatic breast cancer. Treatment options are limited and in order to develop more targeted therapies, improved understanding of the complex mechanisms that lead to bone lesion development are warranted. Interestingly, whilst prostate-derived bone metastases are characterised by mixed or osteoblastic lesions, breast-derived bone metastases are characterised by osteolytic lesions, suggesting unique regulatory patterns. This study aimed to measure the changes in bone formation and bone resorption activity at two time-points (18 and 36 days) during development of the bone lesion following intratibial injection of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells into the left tibiae of Severely Combined Immuno-Deficient (SCID) mice. The contralateral tibia was used as a control. Tibiae were extracted and processed for undecalcified histomorphometric analysis. We provide evidence that the early bone loss observed following exposure to MDA-MB-231 cells was due to a significant reduction in mineral apposition rate, rather than increased levels of bone resorption. This suggests that osteoblast activity was impaired in the presence of breast cancer cells, contrary to previous reports of osteoclast-dependent bone loss. Furthermore mRNA expression of Dickkopf Homolog 1 (DKK-1) and Noggin were confirmed in the MDA-MB-231 cell line, both of which antagonise osteoblast regulatory pathways. The observed bone loss following injection of cancer cells was due to an overall thinning of the trabecular bone struts rather than perforation of the bone tissue matrix (as measured by trabecular width and trabecular separation, respectively), suggesting an opportunity to reverse the cancer-induced bone changes. These novel insights into the mechanisms through which osteolytic bone lesions develop may be important in the development of new treatment strategies for metastatic breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2005091500,"Recently, genetic polymorphism (rs3803662C>T) in TOX3 was reported to induce the risk of breast cancer. In this study, we hypothesized that rs3803662 could influence gastric cancer survival outcomes.With multiplex SNaPshot method, we genotyped TOX3 rs3803662 in 880 gastric patients with surgical resection. The association between genotype and survival outcomes was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression analysis models and the log-rank test.There was no association in the analyses of rs3803662 and survival of gastric cancer. However, the stratified analysis by histology showed that rs3803662 CT/TT genotype was associated with a significantly better survival for diffuse-type gastric cancer (log-rank p = 0.030, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.46-0.96), than the CC genotype. In addition, this favorable effect was especially obvious among gastric cancer patients with tumor size >5 cm, T3 and T4 depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, no drinking, no distant metastasis, no chemotherapy and gastric cardia cancer.TOX3 rs3803662 might play an important role in the prognostic outcome and treatment of gastric cancer, especially perhaps further help in explaining the reduced risk of death associated with diffuse-type gastric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2043871738,"The determination of cell fate and the establishment of polarity axes during Drosophila oogenesis depend upon pathways that localize mRNAs within the egg chamber and control their on-site translation. One factor that plays a central role in regulating on-site translation of mRNAs is Orb. Orb is a founding member of the conserved CPEB family of RNA-binding proteins. These proteins bind to target sequences in 3' UTRs and regulate mRNA translation by modulating poly(A) tail length. In addition to controlling the translation of axis-determining mRNAs like grk, fs(1)K10, and osk, Orb protein autoregulates its own synthesis by binding to orb mRNA and activating its translation. We have previously shown that Rasputin (Rin), the Drosophila homologue of Ras-GAP SH3 Binding Protein (G3BP), associates with Orb in a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. Rin is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein believed to function as a link between Ras signaling and RNA metabolism. Here we show that Orb and Rin form a complex in the female germline. Characterization of a new rin allele shows that rin is essential for oogenesis. Co-localization studies suggest that Orb and Rin form a complex in the oocyte at different stages of oogenesis. This is supported by genetic and biochemical analyses showing that rin functions as a positive regulator in the orb autoregulatory pathway by increasing Orb protein expression. Tandem Mass Spectrometry analysis shows that several canonical stress granule proteins are associated with the Orb-Rin complex suggesting that a conserved mRNP complex regulates localized translation during oogenesis in Drosophila."

X-ray structures show that heparin binding results in extension of helix D in the region 131–136 with coincident, and possibly coupled, expulsion of the hinge of the reactive center loop. To examine the importance of helix D extension, we have introduced strong helix-promoting mutations in the 131–136 region of antithrombin (YRKAQK to LEEAAE). The resulting variant has endogenous fluorescence indistinguishable from WT antithrombin yet, in the absence of heparin, shows massive enhancements in rates of inhibition of factors IXa and Xa (114- and 110-fold, respectively), but not of thrombin, together with changes in near- and far-UV CD and 1H NMR spectra. Heparin binding gives only ∼3–4-fold further rate enhancement but increases tryptophan fluorescence by ∼23% without major additional CD or NMR changes. Variants with subsets of these mutations show intermediate activation in the absence of heparin, again with basal fluorescence similar to WT and large increases upon heparin binding.

An early proposal for the link between conformational change and activation, based on x-ray structures of α1-proteinase inhibitor and antithrombin, was that heparin directly promotes the extension of helix D, which in turn results in expulsion of the partially inserted hinge of the reactive center loop (RCL) from β-sheet A and so renders the P1 arginine in the RCL more accessible to target proteinase (Fig. 1) (9van Boeckel C.A.

However, in both studies it was found that, although heparin enhancements of the rate of inhibition of factor Xa had been reduced from that observed with WT antithrombin, there were still rate enhancements of 13–22-fold. One explanation is that residue(s) between the end of helix D and residue 133 might be responsible for this residual heparin-inducible activation, even though the RCL hinge is no longer expellable. In keeping with this, a more recent report on a Y131L antithrombin variant found that, in the absence of heparin, the variant was partially activated against factor Xa and was activated further by heparin binding, to a rate even higher than for WT antithrombin (12dela Cruz R.G. Jairajpuri M.A. Bock S.C. Disruption of a tight cluster surrounding tyrosine 131 in the native conformation of antithrombin III activates it for factor Xa inhibition.J. Biol.

In that study, however, no fluorescence enhancements were reported that might have indicated whether the RCL hinge was expelled, either before or after heparin binding. To more fully examine the role of Tyr-131 and of residues C-terminal to this in the heparin activation mechanism, we have created a new, more extensively mutated antithrombin variant in which helix-promoting residues were introduced at all positions in the stretch 131–136, including leucine at position 131, as well as another variant with the same mutations, although without the Y131L mutation, and we compared the properties to both WT and the recreated Y131L variant. We found that the 131–136 mutations result in dramatic activation as an inhibitor of both factor IXa and factor Xa in the absence of heparin, with rates close to those of fully heparin-activated WT. H5 binding subsequently gives only minor additional rate enhancement but to rates that surpass those of WT by ∼3-fold. The mutations also induced major conformational changes in the variant, observed by perturbations of CD and NMR spectra. Variants with the Y131L mutation alone or else the 132–136 mutations alone each gave lower activation in the absence of heparin, with values that, when combined, were similar to the full 131–136 set of mutations. Basal fluorescence of all three variants was similar to WT and gave enhancements of 23–36% upon binding heparin, consistent with the RCL hinge being inserted in the absence of heparin and expelled upon heparin binding. These findings support a three-part contribution to rate acceleration, with Tyr-131 and Ala-134 (the latter as a result of D helix extension) independently contributing the bulk of the rate enhancements and expulsion of the RCL hinge an additional ∼3-fold increase. These components are likely to be similar in the normal heparin-induced activation of WT antithrombin. Human prothrombin and antithrombin were isolated from outdated plasma by previously described procedures (13Ngai P.K. Chang J.-Y.

The synthesis of sulfated dextran beads for isolation of human plasma coagulation factors II, IX, and X.Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa and factor IXa were from Hematologic Technologies, Inc., or Enzyme Research. Proteinase concentrations were determined by chromogenic substrate assays that had been standardized with active site-titrated proteinase (16Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. The antithrombin P1 residue is important for target proteinase specificity but not for heparin activation of the serpin.

Synthetic high affinity pentasaccharide was from Sanofi-Synthelabo LLC. Heparin concentrations were determined by stoichiometric fluorescence titrations of plasma α-antithrombin. Recombinant wild-type antithrombin and its variants were produced in the Baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) similarly to past studies (17Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. Residues Tyr253 and Glu255 in strand 3 of β-sheet C of antithrombin are key determinants of an exosite made accessible by heparin activation to promote rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Antithrombin cDNA was cloned into the pFastBac donor plasmid to carry out site-specific transposition of an expression cassette into a baculovirus vector (bacmid) propagated in Escherichia coli. High molecular weight mini-prep DNA isolated from selected E. coli clones containing the recombinant plasmid was used to transfect insect cells. Conditioned serum-free medium harvested 3–4 days post-infection of High 5 cells was clarified by centrifugation and used for antithrombin purification by affinity chromatography on a heparin-Sepharose column and ion-exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column. The final yield of pure protein was 1–2 mg from a liter of cultivated medium. Stoichiometries of inhibition of human thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa in the presence and absence of heparin were measured by titration of proteinase with inhibitor monitored spectroscopically by the chromogenic assay of residual thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa activity with substrates S-2238, Spectrozyme FXa, and Spectrozyme FIXa, respectively. Thrombin and factor Xa reactions were carried out in either 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, or 20 mm Tris-hydrochloride, 0.25 m NaCl, buffers at pH 7.4 each containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 0.1% PEG 8000, whereas factor IXa reactions were carried out in 0.1 m Hepes, 93.5 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, all at 25 °C. For the reactions in the absence of heparin, the buffer system contained 50 μg/ml Polybrene to complex any trace heparin contamination. Increasing amounts of antithrombin (10–120 nm) were added to proteinase (100 nm), and reactions, with or without added H5 (200 nm), were allowed to proceed to completion. Residual enzyme activity was measured by chromogenic assay in reaction buffer, with factor IXa assays being supplemented with 33% ethylene glycol to enhance activity. The inhibition stoichiometries were determined by plotting the residual proteinase activity against the ratio of inhibitor to enzyme, based on antithrombin concentrations determined by absorbance (18Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. The size and shape of human and bovine antithrombin III.Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The rates of inhibition of thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa by antithrombin alone and H5-activated antithrombin were measured under pseudo first-order conditions of 50–2500 nm antithrombin and 1–250 nm proteinase in the reaction buffers and with chromogenic substrates described above. For H5-catalyzed reactions with thrombin and factor IXa, H5 was added in 1.5–2-fold molar excess over antithrombin to saturate the inhibitor. For reactions with factor Xa subsaturating levels of H5 were used, although with antithrombin concentrations (100 nm) that ensured full complexation of the added H5. The pseudo first-order constants (kobs) for all reactions, except H5-catalyzed reactions with factor Xa, were obtained by nonlinear regression fitting of residual enzyme activity against time of incubation, by a single exponential function. A non-zero end point was assumed for factor IXa reactions to account for small amounts of degraded proteinase (<10%) less susceptible to inhibition. kobs for H5-catalyzed antithrombin-factor Xa reactions was obtained by fitting residual enzyme activity measured in fixed time reactions (1–5 min) against H5 concentration by a single exponential function. The second-order rate constant in the absence of heparin or in the presence of saturating H5 was obtained by dividing kobs by the concentration of antithrombin. For the H5-catalyzed antithrombin-factor Xa reaction, the second-order rate constant (kapp) was determined by dividing kobs by the fixed reaction time (17Izaguirre G. Olson S.T. Residues Tyr253 and Glu255 in strand 3 of β-sheet C of antithrombin are key determinants of an exosite made accessible by heparin activation to promote rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13424-13432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This method yields equivalent results as the independent time course method with saturating H5. All kapp values were found to be independent of the concentration of antithrombin or antithrombin-H5 complex over the range of concentrations examined, consistent with second-order conditions. All reactions were carried out in polyethylene glycol-coated cuvettes. For calculation of the effective second-order rate constant, the value of kapp was multiplied by SI. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-710 spectrometer at room temperature in 2-mm cuvettes. For far-UV spectra, 5–10 μm samples of antithrombin, in the presence or absence of pentasaccharide at a 3:1 ratio with antithrombin in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA, were scanned from 250 to 200 nm. For near-UV spectra, 25–30 μm samples of antithrombin in the same buffer system were scanned from 310 to 250 nm. Heparin was added to antithrombin at 6:1 ratio. Base lines were recorded by scanning either buffer alone or with the presence of appropriate amount of heparin. Emission spectra were recorded on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorimeter (excitation at 280 nm). Slits of 4 nm were used for excitation and 16 nm for emission, and integration time was 5 s. 100 nm samples of antithrombin were in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000. Following acquisition of duplicate spectra of antithrombin, the sample was titrated with H5 to an end point by adding at least 3 molar eq of H5. Duplicate spectra of H5-complexed antithrombin were then acquired. Spectra were corrected for buffer and dilution and averaged. Observed binding stoichiometries obtained by fitting titrations by the quadratic equilibrium binding function were within 10% of equimolar, ensuring that equivalent concentrations of free and H5-complexed WT and variant antithrombins were being compared. Errors represent ± 2 S.E. from at least four titrations. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 900 MHz and equipped with a cryoprobe. Antithrombin samples at 10–20 μm were dialyzed against D2O buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.7. Heparin pentasaccharide was added to antithrombin at a 5:1 molar ratio to ensure saturation. Dissociation constants for the binding of control and variant antithrombins to H5 were determined at I = 0.45, to weaken affinity and hence improve accuracy, by monitoring the enhancement of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of antithrombin upon titration with a heparin stock solution as described previously (12dela Cruz R.G. Jairajpuri M.A. Bock S.C. Disruption of a tight cluster surrounding tyrosine 131 in the native conformation of antithrombin III activates it for factor Xa inhibition.J. Biol.

The excitation bandwidth was 4 nm, and the emission bandwidth was 16 nm. Kd values were determined by computer fitting to the quadratic equilibrium binding equation assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry. In wild-type antithrombin helix D forms a major part of the heparin pentasaccharide-binding site. Immediately following helix D are the residues 131–136, which do not take part in binding the pentasaccharide. In the absence of heparin, these residues are unstructured but adopt a helical conformation upon pentasaccharide binding. Residues 131–136 have the sequence YRKANK (YRKAQK in the N135Q background used). Using the Chou-Fasman predictive algorithm (19Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Conformational parameters for amino acids in helix, β sheet and random coil regions calculated for proteins.Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar), this has a helix-forming potential (Pα) of only 0.95, where a value of 1 represents a frequency the same as for the average residue in a chain. To promote helix formation in the absence of heparin, these residues were changed to LEEAAE, which has a Chou-Fasman Pα of 1.47, i.e. close to the maximum possible. Although the hD(131–136) variant differs in sequence from WT at 5 of the 6 positions, individual changes at 4 of these positions have been made without affecting basal rates of reaction with factor Xa or the enhancements seen upon heparin binding. Thus, none of the individual mutations R132M, K133M (20Meagher J.L. Huntington J.A. Fan B. Gettins P.G. Role of arginine 132 and lysine 133 in heparin binding to, and activation of, antithrombin.J.

Saturating H5 modestly increased the second-order rate constant for both the hD(131–136) variant and WT (Table 1).TABLE 1Second order rate constants and SI values of WT and variant antithrombins In dramatic contrast to the small effects that the 131–136 mutations had on either second-order rate constants or SI for reaction with thrombin, the effects for reaction with either factor Xa or factor IXa, in the absence of heparin, were very large increases in rate constants and an increase in SI. For factor Xa, the rate constant in the absence of H5 was increased by ∼110-fold, whereas for factor IXa the increase was ∼114-fold, compared with WT. The SI values increased from 1.2 and 1.1 for WT reacting with factor Xa and factor IXa, respectively, to 3.5 and 2.0. Whereas H5 binding to WT resulted in an ∼110- and ∼160-fold increase in rate constant for reaction with factor Xa and factor IXa, respectively, H5 binding caused only an additional 2.7- and 3.7-fold increase, respectively, with little further change in SI. The magnitude of the changes for the variant means that, in the absence of H5, the hD(131–136) variant is about as reactive as fully heparin-activated WT. Because H5 does still cause modest further increases, the H5-bound hD(131–136) variant is actually about 3-fold faster that the equivalent H5-bound WT antithrombin for both factor IXa and factor Xa. Of the five mutations in residues 131–136, the change of Y131L, present as part of hD(131–136), has been previously reported and partly characterized (12dela Cruz R.G. Jairajpuri M.A. Bock S.C. Disruption of a tight cluster surrounding tyrosine 131 in the native conformation of antithrombin III activates it for factor Xa inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31668-31676Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is known from that study that the Y131L mutation results in partial activation against factor Xa, but not thrombin, with no data reported for factor IXa. To determine whether the mutations at 131 and 132–136 contributed in an additive or more synergistic way to the rate enhancements for factors IXa and Xa, we made both the same Y131L variant as before, as well as a new variant in which only the residues 132–136 were changed (to the same EEAAE as in hD(131–132)). We refer to this variant as hD(132–136). As with the hD(131–136) variant, neither the Y131L nor the hD(132–136) variant showed much difference in rates of reaction with thrombin compared with WT antithrombin (Table 1). For reaction with factor Xa in the absence of H5, Y131L and hD(132–136) variants gave ka ∼11- and ∼18-fold increases, respectively, compared with WT. This represents a close to additive contribution compared with the hD(131–136) variant (11 × 18 = 198-fold versus 110-fold observed for hD(131–136)). Similar behavior was observed for reaction with factor IXa: increases in ka in the absence of H5 of 7- and 11-fold were found for Y131L and hD(132–136) variants, respectively (Table 1), which would predict an increase of ∼77-fold if the contributions were simply additive, compared with the observed 114-fold increase. For reaction with both proteinases, the effect of binding H5 to either variant was a much greater increase in ka than for the hD(131–136) variant, although the absolute values obtained were similar to those for the H5-bound hD(131–136) variant (Table 1), indicating that whatever activating changes were present in the hD(131–136) variant but absent from the Y131L or hD(132–136) variants were made up by binding H5. For reactions with both factor Xa and factor IXa, the final value of ka for hD(132–136) represented a higher rate of reaction than for H5-bound WT. Activation of WT antithrombin by the binding of heparin results in major conformational changes that are seen not only in x-ray structures but also in changes in solution CD and NMR spectra. We therefore examined both CD and one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra to determine whether the mutations had caused significant conformational changes and also to determine what changes were subsequently brought about by H5 binding. Although far-UV CD can only give a measure of overall secondary structure and of changes in it, near-UV CD can report sensitively on changes around aromatic residues (24Rogers D.M. Hirst J.D. First-principles calculation of protein circular dichroism in the near ultraviolet.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11092-11102Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both far- and near-UV CD spectra were recorded for WT and hD(131–136) variant antithrombins in the absence and presence of H5 (Fig. 2). The spectra of the WT antithrombin were the same as reported previously, with far-UV spectra reporting a modest but significant alteration in ellipticity and near-UV spectra showing very large changes throughout (Fig. 2, A and B) (2Björk I. Danielsson Å. Fish W.W. Larsson K. Lieden K. Nordenman B. Collen D. Wiman B. Verstraete M. The Physiological Inhibitors of Coagulation and Fibrinolysis.

U.S.A. 1982; 79: 7190-7194Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, the far-UV spectrum of hD(131–136) antithrombin was distinct from either of the wild-type spectra and showed no change upon H5 binding (Fig. 2A). Similar behavior was found in the near-UV, where the non-heparin-bound state gave a spectrum distinct from either of the wild-type spectra, although closer to that of heparin-bound wild type, and changes upon binding H5 that were small relative to those caused by pentasaccharide binding to the WT control (Fig. 2B). In contrast to the large differences between hD(131–136) and WT antithrombin, the Y131L variant gave near-UV CD spectra that were very similar to WT in the absence of H5 and underwent similar changes to WT upon H5 binding (Fig. 2C). For WT antithrombin, the aromatic region of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum (6–8 ppm) showed good dispersion reflecting the extensive β-sheet and many buried perturbing aromatic side chains (Fig. 3A), as has been seen earlier in studies on plasma antithrombin (6Horne A.

Because aromatic resonances have chemical shifts that depend exquisitely on the precise geometry relative to other proximal aromatic residues that perturb them, they are extremely sensitive reporters of conformational changes that affect the hydrophobic core.

Animals infused with GCM had significantly less huntingtin inclusions in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and in the ipsilateral and contralateral striata than mice infused with cerebrospinal fluid. The numbers of DARPP-32 and TH positive neurons were also greater in the ipsilateral but not contralateral striata and substantia nigra, respectively, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of GCM on efferent striatal and nigro-striatal dopamine neurons. GCM increases activity of the autophagic pathway, as shown by the reduction of autophagic substrate, p-62, and the augmentation of LC3 II, Beclin-1 and LAMP-2 protein levels, direct markers of autophagy, in GCM infused mice. GCM also increases BDNF levels. These results suggest that CGM should be further explored as a putative neuroprotective agent in Huntington's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2031491155,"Acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of infectious disease-related morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality among children worldwide, and particularly in developing countries. In these low-income countries, most patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), whether it is mild or severe, are still treated empirically. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk factors associated with the evolution and outcome of respiratory illnesses in patients aged under 5 years old.We conducted a prospective study in a paediatric ward in Antananarivo from November 2010 to July 2012 including patients under 5 years old suffering from respiratory infections. We collected demographic, socio-economic, clinical and epidemiological data, and samples for laboratory analysis. Deaths, rapid progression to respiratory distress during hospitalisation, and hospitalisation for more than 10 days were considered as severe outcomes. We used multivariate analysis to study the effects of co-infections.From November 2010 to July 2012, a total of 290 patients were enrolled. Co-infection was found in 192 patients (70%). Co-infections were more frequent in children under 36 months, with a significant difference for the 19-24 month-old group (OR: 8.0). Sixty-nine percent (230/290) of the patients recovered fully and without any severe outcome during hospitalisation; the outcome was scored as severe for 60 children and nine patients (3%) died. Risk factors significantly associated with worsening evolution during hospitalisation (severe outcome) were admission at age under 6 months (OR = 5.3), comorbidity (OR = 4.6) and low household income (OR = 4.1).Co-mordidity, low-income and age under 6 months increase the risk of severe outcome for children infected by numerous respiratory pathogens. These results highlight the need for implementation of targeted public health policy to reduce the contribution of respiratory diseases to childhood morbidity and mortality in low income countries."
https://openalex.org/W1964236969,"Purpose In clinical ophthalmology as in other fields, measuring patient-reported outcomes imposes a burden on patients. To decrease that burden, we used item-response theory (IRT) to develop and test a short version of the National Eye Institute's Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ). Methods We analyzed VFQ data from 276 adults in Japan. Most of them had glaucoma, cataract, or macular degeneration. Their visual acuity (Snellen fraction) averaged 20/120 (range: 20/13 to 20/2000) for the better eye, and 20/200 (range: 20/13 to 20/2000) for the worse eye. We used a polytomous IRT model, the Generalized Partial Credit Model as implemented in software for parameter scaling of rating data (PARSCALE). To select items for inclusion in the short version we examined each item's location on the latent-trait continuum, its slope, and its frequency of missing data. We also ensured representation of all 7 domains that are important in Japan. To examine the characteristics of the resulting scale, we computed its test information (an index of precision that can vary with the value of the latent trait), and carried out validation testing. Results From 32 of the original VFQ items, we selected 11. The scale comprising those 11 items (the VFQ-J11) had test information greater than 9 for values of the latent trait between −2.0 and +0.8. The item thresholds were well-targeted for patients with vision problems. Scores on the VFQ-J11 correlated strongly and in the expected direction with measures of visual field and corrected visual acuity. As expected for a valid measure, those scores also improved by a large amount (almost one standard deviation) after cataract surgery. Conclusion This 11-item instrument can provide reliable and the valid data on visual functioning in patients with ophthalmic problems. It is expected to be less of a burden on respondents, while it maintains good psychometric properties."
https://openalex.org/W1994188629,"The role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on breast cancer progression, growth and tumorigenesis remains controversial or unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of MSCs on breast tumor induction and growth in a clinically relevant somatic breast cancer model. We first conducted in vitro studies and found that conditioned media (CM) of RCAS-Neu and RCAS-PyMT breast cancer cell lines and tumor cells themselves dramatically increased the proliferation and motility of MSCs and induced morphological changes of MSCs and differentiation into fibroblast-like cells. In contrast, the CM of MSCs inhibited the proliferation of two breast cancer cell lines by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. In vivo studies revealed that fluorescence dye-labeled MSCs migrated into tumor tissues. Unexpectedly, single or multiple intravenous injections of MSCs did not affect the latency of breast cancer in TVA- transgenic mice induced by intraductal injection of the RCAS vector encoding polyoma middle-T antigen (PyMT) or Neu oncogenes. Moreover, MSCs had no effect on RCAS-Neu tumor growth in a syngeneic ectopic breast cancer model. While our studies consistently demonstrated the ability of breast cancer cells to profoundly induce MSCs migration, differentiation, and proliferation, the anti-proliferative effect of MSCs on breast tumor cells observed in vitro could not be translated into an antitumor activity in vivo, probably reflecting the antagonizing or complex effects of MSCs on tumor environment and tumor cells themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2000480553,"We report here protection against rotenone-induced behavioural dysfunction, striatal dopamine depletion and nigral neuronal loss, following intra-striatal transplantation of neurons differentiated from murine embryonic stem cells (mES). mES maintained in serum free medium exhibited increase in neuronal, and decrease in stem cell markers by 7th and 10th days as revealed by RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses. Tyrosine hydroxylase, NURR1, PITX3, LMX1b and c-RET mRNA showed a significant higher expression in differentiated cells than in mES. Dopamine level was increased by 3-fold on 10th day as compared to 7 days differentiated cells. Severity of rotenone-induced striatal dopamine loss was attenuated, and amphetamine-induced unilateral rotations were significantly reduced in animals transplanted with 7 days differentiated cells, but not in animals that received undifferentiated ES transplant. However, the ratio of contralateral to ipsilateral swings in elevated body swing test was significantly reduced in both the transplanted groups, as compared to control. Striatal grafts exhibited the presence of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells, and the percentage of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra was also found to be higher in the ipsilateral side of 7 days and mES grafted animals. Increased expression of CD11b and IBA-1, suggested a significant contribution of these microglia-derived factors in controlling the limited survival of the grafted cells. Astrocytosis in the grafted striatum, and significant increase in the levels of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor may have contributed to the recovery observed in the hemiparkinsonian rats following transplantation."

This study aimed to determine the effects of ammonia or terrestrial exposure on ammonia concentrations in the plasma and brain, and the mRNA expression and protein abundance of nkcc/Nkcc in the brain, of the swamp eel Monopterusalbus. Ammonia exposure led to a greater increase in the ammonia concentration in the brain of M. albus than terrestrial exposure. The brain ammonia concentration of M. albus reached 4.5 µmol g(-1) and 2.7 µmol g(-1) after 6 days of exposure to 50 mmol l(-1) NH4Cl and terrestrial conditions, respectively. The full cDNA coding sequence of nkcc1b from M. albus brain comprised 3276 bp and coded for 1092 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 119.6 kDa. A molecular characterization indicated that it could be activated through phosphorylation and/or glycosylation by osmotic and/or oxidative stresses. Ammonia exposure for 1 day or 6 days led to significant decreases in the nkcc1b mRNA expression and Nkcc1b protein abundance in the brain of M. albus. In comparison, a significant decrease in nkcc1b mRNA expression was observed in the brain of M. albus only after 6 days of terrestrial exposure, but both 1 day and 6 days of terrestrial exposure resulted in significant decreases in the protein abundance of Nkcc1b. These results are novel because it has been established in mammals that ammonia up-regulates NKCC1 expression in astrocytes and NKCC1 plays an important role in ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling and brain edema. By contrast, our results indicate for the first time that M. albus is able to down-regulate the mRNA and protein expression of nkcc1b/Nkcc1b in the brain when confronted with ammonia toxicity, which could be one of the contributing factors to its extraordinarily high brain ammonia tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2054826362,"Microstegium vimineum is a shade tolerant annual C4 invasive grass in the Eastern US, which has been shown to negatively impact species diversity and succession in hardwood forests. To date, empirical studies have shown that population expansion is limited to <1 m yr−1, which is largely driven by gravity dispersal. However, this likely does not fully account for all mechanisms of population-scale dispersal as we observe greater rates of population expansion. Though water, both riparian and non-riparian water (i.e., ephemeral overland flow), have been speculated mechanisms for M. vimineum dispersal, few studies have empirically tested this hypothesis. We designed an experiment along the slopes of a Southwest Virginia hardwood forest to test the role of non-riparian water on local seed dispersal. We developed a seed marking technique by coating each seed with an ultraviolet (UV) powder that did not affect buoyancy to aid in situ seed recapture. Additionally, a new image analysis protocol was developed to automate seed identification from UV photos. Total seed mobility (summation of individual seed movement within each transect) was positively correlated with precipitation. Over a period of one month with 52.32 mm of precipitation, the maximum dispersal distance of any single recaptured seed was 2.4 m, and the average distance of dispersed seed was 0.21±0.04 m. This is the first quantitative evidence of non-riparian water dispersal in a forest understory, which accounts for an additional pathway of population expansion."
https://openalex.org/W1983044137,"The Insulin Receptor (InR) in Drosophila presents features conserved in its mammalian counterparts. InR is required for growth; it is expressed in the central and embryonic nervous system and modulates the time of differentiation of the eye photoreceptor without altering cell fate. We show that the InR is required for the formation of the peripheral nervous system during larval development and more particularly for the formation of sensory organ precursors (SOPs) on the fly notum and scutellum. SOPs arise in the proneural cluster that expresses high levels of the proneural proteins Achaete (Ac) and Scute (Sc). The other cells will become epidermis due to lateral inhibition induced by the Notch (N) receptor signal that prevents its neighbors from adopting a neural fate. In addition, misexpression of the InR or of other components of the pathway (PTEN, Akt, FOXO) induces the development of an abnormal number of macrochaetes that are Drosophila mechanoreceptors. Our data suggest that InR regulates the neural genes ac, sc and sens. The FOXO transcription factor which is localized in the cytoplasm upon insulin uptake, displays strong genetic interaction with the InR and is involved in Ac regulation. The genetic interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ras and InR/FOXO suggest that these proteins cooperate to induce neural gene expression. Moreover, InR/FOXO is probably involved in the lateral inhibition process, since genetic interactions with N are highly significant. These results show that the InR can alter cell fate, independently of its function in cell growth and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2084340724,"RecQ helicases, essential enzymes for maintaining genome integrity, possess the capability to participate in a wide variety of DNA metabolisms. They can initiate the homologous recombination repair pathway by unwinding damaged dsDNA and suppress hyper-recombination by promoting Holliday junction (HJ) migration. To learn how DrRecQ participates in the homologous recombination repair pathway, solution structures of Deinococcus radiodurans RecQ (DrRecQ) and its complexes with DNA substrates were investigated by small angle x-ray scattering. We found that the catalytic core and the most N-terminal HRDC (helicase and RNase D C-terminal) domain (HRDC1) undergo a conformational change to a compact state upon binding to a junction DNA. Furthermore, models of DrRecQ in complexes with two kinds of junction DNA (fork junction and HJ) were built based on the small angle x-ray scattering data, and together with the EMSA results, possible binding sites were proposed. It is demonstrated that two DrRecQ molecules bind to the opposite arms of HJ. This architecture is similar to the RuvAB complex and is hypothesized to be highly conserved in the other HJ migration proteins. This work provides us new clues to understand the roles DrRecQ plays in the RecFOR pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2141833001,"A complete understanding of the cognitive systems underwriting theory of mind (ToM) abilities requires articulating how mental state representations are generated and processed in everyday situations. Individuals rarely announce their intentions prior to acting, and actions are often consistent with multiple mental states. In order for ToM to operate effectively in such situations, mental state representations should be generated in response to certain actions, even when those actions occur in the presence of mental state content derived from other aspects of the situation. Results from three experiments with preschool children and adults demonstrate that mental state information is indeed generated based on an approach action cue in situations that contain competing mental state information. Further, the frequency with which participants produced or endorsed explanations that include mental states about an approached object decreased when the competing mental state information about a different object was made explicit. This set of experiments provides some of the first steps toward identifying the observable action cues that are used to generate mental state representations in everyday situations and offers insight into how both young children and adults processes multiple mental state representations."
https://openalex.org/W2059820490,"Drug-seeking behavior elicited by drug-associated cues contributes to relapse in addiction; however, whether relapse elicited by drug-associated conditioned reinforcers (CR) versus discriminative stimuli (DS) involves distinct or overlapping neuronal populations is unknown. To address this question, we developed a novel cocaine self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement paradigm that exposed the same rats to distinct cocaine-associated CR and DS. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine in separate sessions. In one, a DS signaled cocaine availability; in the other, cocaine delivery was paired with a different CR. After extinction training and reinstatement testing, where both cues were presented in separate sessions, rats were sacrificed and processed for cellular analysis of temporal activity by fluorescent in situ hybridization (CatFISH) for activity regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA and for radioactive in situ hybridization for Arc and zif268 mRNAs. CatFISH did not reveal significant changes in Arc mRNA expression. Similar results were obtained with radioactive in situ hybridization. We have shown that while rats reinstate drug seeking in response to temporally discrete presentations of distinct drug-associated cues, such reinstatement is not associated with increased transcriptional activation of Arc or zif268 mRNAs, suggesting that expression of these genes may not be necessary for cue-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2047150734,"To aid in the characterization of the relationship of structure and function for human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 RT), this investigation utilized DNAs containing benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE)-modified primers and templates as a probe of the architecture of this complex. BPDE lesions that differed in their stereochemistry around the C10 position were covalently linked to N6-adenine and positioned in either the primer or template strand of a duplex template-primer. HIV-1 RT exhibited a stereoisomer-specific and strand-specific difference in replication when the BPDE-lesion was placed in the template versus the primer strand. When the C10R-BPDE adduct was positioned in the primer strand in duplex DNA, 5 nucleotides from the 3΄ end of the primer terminus, HIV-1 RT could not fully replicate the template, producing truncated products; this block to further synthesis did not affect rates of dissociation or DNA binding affinity. Additionally, when the adducts were in the same relative position, but located in the template strand, similar truncated products were observed with both the C10R and C10S BPDE adducts. These data suggest that the presence of covalently-linked intercalative DNA adducts distant from the active site can lead to termination of DNA synthesis catalyzed by HIV-1 RT."
