Understanding the genetic factors contributing to the shared and disorder-specific symptoms will be crucial for improving diagnosis and treatment. In genetic data consisting of 53,555 cases (20,129 bipolar disorder [BD], 33,426 schizophrenia [SCZ]) and 54,065 controls, we identified 114 genome-wide significant loci implicating synaptic and neuronal pathways shared between disorders. Comparing SCZ to BD (23,585 SCZ, 15,270 BD) identified four genomic regions including one with disorder-independent causal variants and potassium ion response genes as contributing to differences in biology between the disorders. Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses identified several significant correlations within case-only phenotypes including SCZ PRS with psychotic features and age of onset in BD. For the first time, we discover specific loci that distinguish between BD and SCZ and identify polygenic components underlying multiple symptom dimensions. These results point to the utility of genetics to inform symptomology and potential treatment. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are two distinct diagnoses that share symptomology.

These results point to the utility of genetics to inform symptomology and potential treatment. Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) are severe psychiatric disorders and among the leading causes of disability worldwide (Whiteford et al., 2013Whiteford H.A. Degenhardt L. Rehm J. Baxter A.J. Ferrari A.J. Erskine H.E. Charlson F.J. Norman R.E. Flaxman A.D.

Both disorders have significant genetic components with heritability estimates ranging from 60% to 80% (Nöthen et al., 2010Nöthen M.M. Nieratschker V. Cichon S. Rietschel M. New findings in the genetics of major psychoses.Dialogues Clin. Neurosci. 2010; 12: 85-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent genetic and epidemiological studies have demonstrated substantial overlap between these two disorders, with a genetic correlation from common variation near 0.6–0.7 (Lee et al., 2013Lee S.H. Ripke S. Neale B.M. Faraone S.V. Purcell S.M. Perlis R.H. Mowry B.J. Thapar A. Goddard M.E.

Yip B.H. Björk C. Pawitan Y. Cannon T.D. Sullivan P.F. Hultman C.M. Common genetic determinants of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in Swedish families: a population-based study.Lancet. 2009; 373: 234-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Despite shared genetics and symptomology, the current diagnostic systems (DSM LibraryDSM Library. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.Google Scholar, World Health OrganizationWorld Health Organization. International Classification of Diseases. http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/.Google Scholar) adhere to historical distinctions from the late 19th century and represent BD and SCZ as independent categorical entities differentiated on the basis of their clinical presentation, with BD characterized by predominant mood symptoms, mood-congruent delusions, and an episodic disease course and SCZ considered a prototypical psychotic disorder. Identifying genetic components contributing to both disorders will provide insight into the biology underlying the shared symptoms of the disorders. While the shared genetic component is substantial, studies to date have also implicated genetic architecture differences between these two disorders (Curtis et al., 2011Curtis D. Vine A.E. McQuillin A. Bass N.J. Pereira A. Kandaswamy R. Lawrence J. Anjorin A. Choudhury K.

Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A polygenic risk score (PRS) created from a case-only SCZ versus BD genome-wide association study (GWAS) significantly correlated with SCZ or BD diagnosis in an independent sample (Ruderfer et al., 2014Ruderfer D.M. Fanous A.H. Ripke S. McQuillin A. Amdur R.L. Gejman P.V. O’Donovan M.C. Andreassen O.A. Djurovic S.

An enrichment of rare, moderate to highly penetrant copy-number variants (CNVs) and de novo CNVs are seen in SCZ patients (Gulsuner and McClellan, 2015Gulsuner S. McClellan J.M.

Although the role of de novo single nucleotide variants in BD and SCZ has been investigated in only a handful of studies, enrichment in pathways associated with the postsynaptic density has been reported for SCZ but not BD (Fromer et al., 2014Fromer M. Pocklington A.J. Kavanagh D.H. Williams H.J. Dwyer S. Gormley P. Georgieva L. Rees E. Palta P.

Psychiatry. 2016; 21: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Identifying disorder-specific variants and quantifying the contribution of genetic variation to specific symptom dimensions remain important open questions. Characterizing these genetic differences will facilitate an understanding of the dimensions of the disorders instead of the dichotomous diagnosis. For example, we have shown that SCZ patients with greater manic symptoms have higher polygenic risk for BD (Ruderfer et al., 2014Ruderfer D.M. Fanous A.H. Ripke S. McQuillin A. Amdur R.L. Gejman P.V.

Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate shared genetic underpinnings for symptoms across disorders and may enable us to characterize patients by genetic liability to symptom dimensions, thereby informing disease course and treatment. Here, we utilize large collections of genotyped samples for BD and SCZ along with clinically relevant measures identifying 28 subphenotypes to address three questions: (1) are there specific variants, genes, or pathways that are either shared by or differentiate BD and SCZ; (2) are the shared symptoms between these disorders driven by the same underlying genetic profiles; and (3) can we demonstrate independent genetic signatures for subphenotypes within these disorders? We performed association analysis of BD and SCZ combined into a single phenotype, totaling 53,555 cases (20,129 BD, 33,426 SCZ) and 54,065 controls on 15.5 million SNP allele dosages imputed from 1000 Genomes phase 3 (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015The 1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumA global reference for human genetic variation.Nature. 2015; 526: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8429) Google Scholar). Logistic regression was performed controlling for 13 principal components of ancestry, study sites, and genotyping platform. We identified 11,231 SNPs with p value below our genome-wide significance (GWS) threshold of 5 × 10−8. After grouping SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 > 0.2), 114 genomic risk loci remained. For the most significant variant in each of the 114 GWS loci, we performed conditional analysis with any GWS hit within 1 Mb of the extent of the locus from the previously performed single disease GWAS of SCZ (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar) and BD (Stahl et al., 2017Stahl E. Forstner A. McQuillin A. Ripke S. Ophoff R. Scott L. Cichon S. Andreassen O.A. Sklar P. Kelsoe J. et al.Bipolar Disorder Working Group of the PGCGenomewide association study identifies 30 loci associated with bipolar disorder.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/173062Crossref Google Scholar) and identified 32 loci that were independently significant, defined strictly as no single disease locus within 1 Mb or a GWS p value after conditional analysis (Table S1). We further performed gene-set-based tests using MAGMA (de Leeuw et al., 2015de Leeuw C.A. Mooij J.M. Heskes T. Posthuma D. MAGMA: generalized gene-set analysis of GWAS data.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2015; 11: e1004219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) across 10,891 curated pathways (Watanabe et al., 2017Watanabe K. Taskesen E. van Bochoven A. Posthuma D. Functional mapping and annotation of genetic associations with FUMA.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01261-5Crossref Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) and identified 8 pathways surpassing Bonferroni correction (p < 4.6 × 10−6) with all but one pathway implicating synaptic and neuronal biology (Table S2a). Establishing independent controls (see STAR Methods) allowed us to perform disorder-specific GWAS in 20,129 BD cases versus 21,524 BD controls and 33,426 SCZ cases and 32,541 SCZ controls. Using these results, we compared disorder-specific effect sizes of these 114 loci, showing that despite contributing to the combined phenotype, subsets of variants had larger effects in SCZ compared to BD and vice versa (Figure 1A). To identify loci with divergent effects on BD and SCZ, we performed an association analysis comparing 23,585 SCZ cases with 15,270 BD cases matched for shared ancestry and genotyping platform (see STAR Methods; Figure 1B; Table 1). Two genome-wide significant loci were identified, the most significant of which was rs56355601, located on chr1 at position 173,811,455 within an intron of DARS2 (Figure S1). The second most significant locus was rs200005157, a four base-pair insertion or deletion, on chr20 at position 47,638,976 in an intron of ARFGEF2 (Figure S2). For both variants, the minor allele frequency was higher in BD cases than SCZ cases, and disease-specific GWAS showed opposite directions of effect when compared to controls. We sought to identify additional disease-specific loci by comprehensively incorporating expression information with association results to perform fine-mapping and identify novel variants (Gamazon et al., 2015Gamazon E.R.

We identified one SNP-probe combination that surpassed the threshold for GWS in blood and was also the most significant finding in brain. We found that SNP rs4793172 in gene DCAKD is associated with SCZ versus BD analysis (pGWAS = 2.8 × 10−6) and is an eQTL for probe ILMN 1811648 (peQTL = 2.9 × 10−168), resulting in pSMR = 4.1 × 10−6 in blood (peQTL = 2.9 × 10−25, pSMR = 2.0 × 10−5 in DLFC; peQTL = 4.6 × 10−15, pSMR = 6.0 × 10−5 in GTEx cerebellar hemisphere) (Figure S3; Table S3) and shows no evidence of heterogeneity (pHET = 0.66), which implies only a single causal variant in the locus.Table 1Most Significant Associated Loci from SCZ versus BD GWASSNPCHRBPA1SCZ versus BD (23,584 versus 15,270)SCZ versus controls (33,426 versus 32,541)BD versus controls (20,129 versus 21,524)Het p valueSCZ freqBD freqPORSCZ freqcontrol freqPORBD freqcontrol freqPORrs563556011173811455T0.74100.72305.7E-091.120.73400.72500.0121.040.72200.72900.04490.961.74E-03rs2000051572047638976D0.53000.51102.4E-081.100.52900.51900.0041.040.51300.52200.00120.951.51E-05rs108320271113357183A0.66300.68406.8E-080.910.66100.65800.0500.980.68400.67100.00041.066.86E-05rs7823741892904254C0.37200.39307.2E-080.910.38000.38800.1150.980.39100.38400.04761.031.12E-02rs7645466350049958T0.49300.47607.8E-081.100.49900.50100.5471.010.48000.48900.00180.955.01E-03Association results for the five most significant variants in the SCZ versus BD GWAS, with the top two being genome-wide significant.

Highlighted in red is the gene (DCAKD) that passed the SMR and HEIDI tests. In an effort to prioritize genes for the two GWS loci from the GWAS, we performed fine-mapping (Benner et al., 2016Benner C. Spencer C.C.A. Havulinna A.S. Salomaa V. Ripatti S. Pirinen M. FINEMAP: efficient variable selection using summary data from genome-wide association studies.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) using a linkage disequilibrium (LD) map derived from a majority of the control samples. We then performed SMR on each of the variants with causal probability greater than 1% using all eQTLs from the CommonMind Consortium DLPFC reference. All the most likely causal variants were shown to most significantly regulate the same gene, suggesting that CSE1L is the most likely relevant gene on chr20 (rs200005157: causal probability = 0.21, pGWAS = 2.4 × 10−8, peQTL 3 × 10−8, pSMR = 8.5 × 10−5, pHET = 0.34). For the locus on chr1, SLC9C2 is the most significantly regulated gene. However, a highly significant heterogeneity test indicates a complex genetic architecture, making it difficult to infer a causal role for the associated SNP. Therefore, DARS2 presents as the most likely relevant gene on chr1 (rs56355601: pGWAS = 5.6 × 10−9, causal probability = 0.079, peQTL 7.4 × 10−13, pSMR = 6.17 × 10−6, pHET = 0.03). We note, however, that in both cases there are variants that are stronger eQTLs for these genes but not as significantly associated, complicating a straightforward causal interpretation. Finally, using the same gene-set test used for the combined analysis gene ontology (GO) biological process “response to potassium ion” (p = 1.6 × 10−6) was the only pathway surpassing our Bonferroni corrected significance threshold (Table S2b). We expanded our efforts to identify disorder-specific genomic regions by jointly analyzing independent GWAS results from BD and SCZ (Pickrell et al., 2016Pickrell J.K. Berisa T. Liu J.Z. Ségurel L. Tung J.Y. Hinds D.A. Detection and interpretation of shared genetic influences on 42 human traits.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The genome was split into 1,703 previously defined approximately LD-independent regions (Berisa and Pickrell, 2016Berisa T. Pickrell J.K. Approximately independent linkage disequilibrium blocks in human populations.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). 13%, or 223 regions, had a posterior probability greater than 0.5 of having a causal variant for at least one disorder. Of these, 132 best fit the model of a shared causal variant influencing both BD and SCZ, 88 were most likely specific to SCZ, 3 demonstrated evidence of two independent variants (with one impacting each of the two disorders), and none were BD specific. Of note, this approach calculates a prior probability that any given region is disease specific and that, from these data, the probability of having a BD-specific region was 0.1% compared to 15% for SCZ, likely a result of increased power from the larger SCZ sample size and/or a difference in genetic architecture between these disorders. The 114 GWS SNPs from the combined BD and SCZ GWAS localized into 99 independent regions (13 regions had multiple GWS SNPs), of which 78 (79%) were shared with a posterior probability of greater than 0.5. Sixty regions had at least one GWS SNP in the independent SCZ GWAS, of which 30 (50%) are shared, and 8 regions contained a GWS SNP in the independent BD GWAS, of which 6 (75%) are shared using the same definition. For the three regions showing evidence for independent variants, two had highly non-overlapping association signals in the same region stemming from independent variants. The third, on chr19, presented a different scenario where association signals were overlapping. The most significant variant in BD was rs111444407 (chr19:19358207, p = 8.67 × 10−10) and for SCZ was rs2315283 (chr19:19480575, p = 4.41 × 10−7). After conditioning on the most significant variant in the other disorder, the association signals of the most significant variant in BD and SCZ were largely unchanged (BD rs111444407 = 1.3 × 10−9; SCZ rs2315283 p = 6.7 × 10−5). We further calculated the probability of each variant in the region being causal for both BD and SCZ (Benner et al., 2016Benner C. Spencer C.C.A. Havulinna A.S. Salomaa V. Ripatti S. Pirinen M. FINEMAP: efficient variable selection using summary data from genome-wide association studies.Bioinformatics. 2016; 32: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and found no correlation (r = −0.00016). The most significant variants had the highest posterior probability of being causal (SCZ: rs2315283, prob = 0.02; BD: rs111444407, prob = 0.16).

We next defined risk regions as those containing the most-associated SNP for each GWS locus. In total, there were 101 SCZ risk regions from the 105 autosomal GWS loci reported previously (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics ConsortiumBiological insights from 108 schizophrenia-associated genetic loci.Nature. 2014; 511: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (5068) Google Scholar) and 29 BD risk regions from 30 GWS loci reported previously (Stahl et al., 2017Stahl E.

Ten regions were risk regions for both BD and SCZ, comprising 33% of BD risk regions and 10% of SCZ risk regions. We further stratified regional h2snp by whether a region was a risk region in one disorder, none, or both (Figure S4). Since the discovery data for the regions overlapped with the data used for the heritability estimation, we expected within-disorder analyses to show significant results. In risk regions specific to SCZ (n = 91), there was a significant increase in regional h2snp in SCZ, as expected (p = 1.1 × 10−22), but also in BD (p = 1.2 × 10−6).

CDK12 loss is enriched in mCRPC relative to clinically localized disease and characterized by focal tandem duplications (FTDs) that lead to increased gene fusions and marked differential gene expression. FTDs associated with CDK12 loss result in highly recurrent gains at loci of genes involved in the cell cycle and DNA replication. CDK12 mutant cases are baseline diploid and do not exhibit DNA mutational signatures linked to defects in homologous recombination. CDK12 mutant cases are associated with elevated neoantigen burden ensuing from fusion-induced chimeric open reading frames and increased tumor T cell infiltration/clonal expansion. CDK12 inactivation thereby defines a distinct class of mCRPC that may benefit from immune checkpoint immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2808355995,"Sea-level rise (SLR) is predicted to elevate water depths above coral reefs and to increase coastal wave exposure as ecological degradation limits vertical reef growth, but projections lack data on interactions between local rates of reef growth and sea level rise. Here we calculate the vertical growth potential of more than 200 tropical western Atlantic and Indian Ocean reefs, and compare these against recent and projected rates of SLR under different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Although many reefs retain accretion rates close to recent SLR trends, few will have the capacity to track SLR projections under RCP4.5 scenarios without sustained ecological recovery, and under RCP8.5 scenarios most reefs are predicted to experience mean water depth increases of more than 0.5 m by 2100. Coral cover strongly predicts reef capacity to track SLR, but threshold cover levels that will be necessary to prevent submergence are well above those observed on most reefs. Urgent action is thus needed to mitigate climate, sea-level and future ecological changes in order to limit the magnitude of future reef submergence. Analyses of current coral reef growth rates in the tropical western Atlantic and Indian Ocean show that few reefs will have the capacity to track sea-level rise projections under Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios without sustained ecological recovery."

However, the lack of markers to prospectively identify and isolate these adult PSCs has significantly hampered their characterization. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell transplantation to address this long-standing issue. Large-scale scRNA-seq of sorted neoblasts unveiled a novel subtype of neoblast (Nb2) characterized by high levels of PIWI-1 mRNA and protein and marked by a conserved cell-surface protein-coding gene, tetraspanin 1 (tspan-1). tspan-1-positive cells survived sub-lethal irradiation, underwent clonal expansion to repopulate whole animals, and when purified with an anti-TSPAN-1 antibody, rescued the viability of lethally irradiated animals after single-cell transplantation. The first prospective isolation of an adult PSC bridges a conceptual dichotomy between functionally and molecularly defined neoblasts, shedding light on mechanisms governing in vivo pluripotency and a source of regeneration in animals.

Here, we assess the resilience of the gut ecosystem to osmotic perturbation at multiple length and timescales using mice as model hosts. Osmotic stress caused reproducible extinction of highly abundant taxa and expansion of less prevalent members in human and mouse microbiotas. Quantitative imaging revealed decimation of the mucus barrier during osmotic perturbation, followed by recovery. The immune system exhibited temporary changes in cytokine levels and a lasting IgG response against commensal bacteria. Increased osmolality prevented growth of commensal strains in vitro, revealing one mechanism contributing to extinction. Environmental availability of microbiota members mitigated extinction events, demonstrating how species reintroduction can affect community resilience. Our findings (1) demonstrate that even mild osmotic diarrhea can cause lasting changes to the microbiota and host and (2) lay the foundation for interventions that increase system-wide resilience."

Ota et al. describe a technique called ghost cytometry that allows cell sorting based on the morphology of the cytoplasm, labeled with a single-color fluorophore. The motion of cells relative to a patterned optical structure provides spatial information that is compressed into temporal signals, which are sequentially measured by a single-pixel detector. Images can be reconstructed from this spatial and temporal information, but this is computationally costly. Instead, using machine learning, cells are classified directly from the compressed signals, without reconstructing an image. The method was able to separate morphologically similar cell types in an ultrahigh-speed fluorescence imaging–activated cell sorter. Science , this issue p. 1246"
https://openalex.org/W2807780587,"The gut microbiota regulates key hepatic functions, notably through the production of bacterial metabolites that are transported via the portal circulation. We evaluated the effects of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from aromatic amino acids (phenylacetate, benzoate, p-cresol, and indole) on liver inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin. Precision-cut liver slices prepared from control mice, Kupffer cell (KC)-depleted mice, and obese mice (ob/ob) were treated with or without LPS and bacterial metabolites. We observed beneficial effects of indole that dose-dependently reduced the LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators at both mRNA and protein levels in precision-cut liver slices prepared from control or ob/ob mice. KC depletion partly prevented the antiinflammatory effects of indole, notably through a reduction of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway activation. In vivo, the oral administration of indole before an LPS injection reduced the expression of key proteins of the NF-KB pathway and downstream proinflammatory gene up-regulation. Indole also prevented LPS-induced alterations of cholesterol metabolism through a transcriptional regulation associated with increased 4β-hydroxycholesterol hepatic levels. In summary, indole appears as a bacterial metabolite produced from tryptophan that is able to counteract the detrimental effects of LPS in the liver. Indole could be a new target to develop innovative strategies to decrease hepatic inflammation.—Beaumont, M., Neyrinck, A.

Here, we argue for “visible” approaches that guide model structure with experimental biology. A major ambition of artificial intelligence lies in translating patient data to successful therapies. Machine learning models face particular challenges in biomedicine, however, including handling of extreme data heterogeneity and lack of mechanistic insight into predictions. Here, we argue for “visible” approaches that guide model structure with experimental biology. Like many fields, biomedicine is in the midst of a data revolution. Comprehensive molecular and clinical datasets—including complete human genomes, gene expression profiles, high-resolution imaging, metabolomics, electronic medical records, and so on—are no longer isolated to a few study participants; in a few years, we will have such comprehensive information for millions of patients (Torkamani et al., 2017Torkamani A. Andersen K.G. Steinhubl S.R. Topol E.J. High-Definition Medicine.Cell. 2017; 170: 828-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Multiple analysis approaches have been advanced to transform patient data into successful therapies, each with their particular benefits and limitations (Figure 1). Most prominently, the field of machine learning has seen dramatic advances in the past few years (LeCun et al., 2015LeCun Y. Bengio Y. Hinton G. Deep learning.Nature. 2015; 521: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (42789) Google Scholar) with much excitement around the use of many-layered, “deep,” artificial neural networks, inspired by actual neural networks and how the brain processes patterns. After training over many examples, artificial neural networks learn to predict the correct answer—or output—that should be returned for the many possible input patterns. Deep learning approaches have been used to recognize objects in images like dogs, people, and faces and to distinguish good from bad moves in games like chess and Go (Silver et al., 2016Silver D. Huang A. Maddison C.J. Guez A. Sifre L. van den Driessche G. Schrittwieser J. Antonoglou I. Panneershelvam V. Lanctot M. et al.Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search.Nature. 2016; 529: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (8694) Google Scholar). Given the parallel advances in biomedical data and computer science, a key question is the extent to which current machine-learning models will be effective at interpreting the massive streams of biomedical information. In particular, will large patient datasets, provided as inputs to deep neural networks or related methods, be sufficient to create the next generation of reliable and precise intelligence infrastructure for understanding and treating disease? Here, we argue that the answer is no—that the very high complexity of biological systems will intrinsically limit applications of current “black box” machine learning in patient data. As one path forward, we highlight a new generation of “visible” approaches that aim to guide the structure of machine-learning models with an increasingly extensive knowledge of biological mechanism. That is, machine learning will not replace the need for experimental cell and tissue biology; it will be substantially enabled by such knowledge, given the right visible intelligence infrastructure. Machine-learning systems face two recognized challenges that become particularly acute in biomedical applications. The first is input heterogeneity. Nearly all types of statistical analysis rely on identifying recurrent patterns in data, which provide rules by which future predictions are made. Problems arise, however, when the same outcomes may result from vastly different inputs. Although such input heterogeneity is a property of many and perhaps all complex systems, biological systems are almost certainly more complex than those addressed by machine learning in other areas. For example, cancer can arise as the result of many different combinations of genetic alterations involving many potential genes, any one of which may be mutated only rarely; as a consequence, each new patient presents a distinct constellation of molecular changes never before seen in nature (Alvarez et al., 2016Alvarez M.J. Shen Y. Giorgi F.M. Lachmann A. Ding B.B. Ye B.H. Califano A. Functional characterization of somatic mutations in cancer using network-based inference of protein activity.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Kourou et al., 2014Kourou K. Exarchos T.P. Exarchos K.P. Karamouzis M.V. Fotiadis D.I. Machine learning applications in cancer prognosis and prediction.Comput. Struct. Biotechnol. J. 2014; 13: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Similar heterogeneity arises in patient data from nearly all common diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodevelopmental disorders, in which recurrent patterns are elusive, making it difficult to make reliable predictions (Boyle et al., 2017Boyle E.A. Li Y.I. Pritchard J.K. An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic.Cell. 2017; 169: 1177-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Even rare, presumably Mendelian, disorders can be modified by myriad genetic modifiers elsewhere. Such heterogeneity has long posed a significant challenge to genetic association studies, which tend to be powered to identify single-locus effects (Figure 1A); it is also a significant challenge for machine learning. One might consider a brute-force solution to the problem of heterogeneity by profiling ever more subjects to increase the total volume of data. Certainly, technologies like DNA sequencing are now powerful and inexpensive enough that we may soon have complete genomes for most new patients. The total number of patients is finite, however. Even for common conditions like cancer and heart disease, the number of available datasets will saturate at a few million patient examples. While a million may seem large, this number is modest compared to the amounts of data often needed to train a statistical model, compounded by the as-yet-unknown, but undoubtedly high, complexity of biological systems. As a consequence, even after obtaining the genome sequence of every patient, the genetic patterns driving disease may still remain undiscovered by current statistical methods. In contrast, in many other applications of machine learning such as game playing, if the machine runs out of test games for learning, more examples can readily be generated without bound. A second well-known challenge is that modern machine learning models, including deep neural networks, are black boxes, devices which focus on predicting outputs from inputs without regard for the mechanism or rationale by which a particular outcome is brought about. The game-playing system known as AlphaGo can beat human Go players (Silver et al., 2016Silver D. Huang A. Maddison C.J. Guez A. Sifre L. van den Driessche G. Schrittwieser J. Antonoglou I. Panneershelvam V. Lanctot M. et al.Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search.Nature. 2016; 529: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (8694) Google Scholar), but an examination of its internal structure gives little insight into its moves. Its neural network is subject to extensive mathematical optimization during training, leading to a dense web of neural connections neither tied to an actual system nor based on human reasoning. Similarly, in biomedicine, many machine-learning methods are being developed to predict patient outcomes (Kourou et al., 2014Kourou K. Exarchos T.P. Exarchos K.P. Karamouzis M.V. Fotiadis D.I. Machine learning applications in cancer prognosis and prediction.Comput. Struct. Biotechnol. J. 2014; 13: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), but these approaches typically do not link predictions to underlying mechanisms (Figure 1B). This is a missed opportunity, as causal mechanistic insights are key to identifying drug targets and advancing basic biological knowledge. A popular toy in the 1950’s was a working model of an automobile engine called the Visible V8, versions of which are still available today (Figure 2A). As with many toy models of cars, the engine turned a crankshaft, useful for driving a car forward. However, the main draw of the Visible V8 was not this final engine output, but its faithful simulation of interacting engine components necessary to bring about this result. The engine was correctly subdivided into parts such as the engine block, cylinder heads, distributor, cooling fan, alternator, and both intake and exhaust manifolds. The block and heads, in turn, contained working models of pistons, spark plugs, cams, and camshafts. Importantly, all these aspects were clearly visible because the entire engine case and its hierarchy of constituent parts were transparent. Like man-made engines, biological systems are also complex machines whose outputs emerge from a hierarchy of internal components (Simon, 1962Simon H.A. The Architecture of Complexity.Proc. Am. Philos. Soc. 1962; 106: 467-482Google Scholar). DNA nucleotides assemble to form sequence domains and genes; linear gene sequences encode 3-dimensional protein structures; proteins assemble to create molecular complexes and pathways; pathways occur within organelles and cells; and cells and cell types assemble to form tissues, organs, and individuals. Mapping such structures has classically been the domain of cell and tissue biology, which has developed a spectrum of experimental measurement techniques to characterize biological machines at each scale (Figure 1C). To name a few of the relevant approaches, protein structures are determined using technologies like cryo-electron microscopy; multimeric protein complexes are cataloged systematically by affinity purification tandem mass spectrometry; larger cell structures are tracked dynamically by advanced light microscopy; and the multicellular architecture of tissues is determined increasingly rapidly by single-cell RNA sequencing. Prior information about cell and tissue biology can also be mined from indirect sources such as literature, although consistent literature curation is a difficult problem and misses the large amount of human biology that we do not yet know (Figure 1D). Unfortunately, basic experimental data types are not usually well connected to analysis of patient data. It is nonetheless easy to see how prior knowledge of biological structure might provide distinct advantages to models capable of incorporating this information—what we here call visible learning—and recent research has begun to prove the concept. Visible learning relates to a topic called model interpretation, an active research area in the field of artificial intelligence. Generally, model interpretation tries to explain a model’s internal logic after a model has been trained (Ribeiro et al., 2016Ribeiro M.T. Singh S. Guestrin C. Why should I trust you?: Explaining the predictions of any classifier.in: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, (ACM). 2016: 1135-1144Crossref Scopus (5730) Google Scholar) or to force the model to have fewer parameters, which makes it easier to interpret (Lei et al., 2016Lei T. Barzilay R. Jaakkola T. Rationalizing neural predictions.http://arXiv.org/abs/1606.04155Date: 2016Google Scholar). In biology, the particular need to understand internal mechanisms, along with the ability to probe these mechanisms, has inspired a class of machine-learning models that is guided by prior mechanistic knowledge. This knowledge is often represented by large molecular network structures, which document known mechanistic aspects of cell biology such as interactions among subunits of a protein complex, between receptors and kinases, or among transcriptional regulatory proteins, enhancers, and genes. One way in which these networks have been used to guide learning is in selection of a minimal set of features for prediction, such as prioritizing candidate disease genes based on network proximity to other genes for which sequence variations are strongly associated with disease (Leiserson et al., 2013Leiserson M.D.M. Eldridge J.V. Ramachandran S. Raphael B.J. Network analysis of GWAS data.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2013; 23: 602-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Network connections can also nominate a set of genes whose input data should be aggregated to create a composite feature, such as pooling of rarely altered genes in cancer into a single pathway, which, viewed as a single aggregate, is recurrently altered across a patient population (Alvarez et al., 2016Alvarez M.J. Shen Y. Giorgi F.M. Lachmann A. Ding B.B. Ye B.H. Califano A. Functional characterization of somatic mutations in cancer using network-based inference of protein activity.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Chuang et al., 2007Chuang H.-Y. Lee E. Liu Y.-T. Lee D. Ideker T. Network-based classification of breast cancer metastasis.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Models with hierarchical (multi-scale) resolution of cell biology are also emerging (Karr et al., 2012Karr J.R. Sanghvi J.C. Macklin D.N. Gutschow M.V. Jacobs J.M. Bolival Jr., B. Assad-Garcia N. Glass J.I. Covert M.W. A whole-cell computational model predicts phenotype from genotype.Cell. 2012; 150: 389-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar), an idea that fits naturally with deep (multi-layered) neural networks. For instance, in formulating a neural network, one might specify the architecture of the intermediate layers—the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and which connections between layers are allowed. These neurons, usually hidden inside of the black box, can be made visible by attaching them to actual biological components (Figure 2B). This idea was recently explored by Lin et al., 2017Lin C. Jain S. Kim H. Bar-Joseph Z. Using neural networks for reducing the dimensions of single-cell RNA-Seq data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: e156Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, who predicted cell type and state using a deep neural network for which the structure was determined based on the hierarchical organization of transcriptional regulatory factors in the nucleus. We extended such a strategy to assemble DCell, a model of a basic eukaryotic cell (Ma et al., 2018Ma J. Yu M.K. Fong S. Ono K. Sage E. Demchak B. Sharan R. Ideker T. Using deep learning to model the hierarchical structure and function of a cell.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). DCell uses a deep neural network to translate a list of mutated genes (genotype input) to the resulting cell proliferation rate (phenotype output). Neurons are organized into banks, each of which maps to a distinct biological module within a large hierarchy of known cellular components and processes. A predicted change in cell phenotype can then be interpreted by examining the functional states of underlying cellular components, internal to DCell, whose neuron states are also highly affected. In building these visible systems, care must be taken to learn from the successes and pitfalls of the vast body of work in biological modeling over the past several decades (Fisher and Henzinger, 2007Fisher J. Henzinger T.A. Executable cell biology.Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For instance, an important lesson is that increased model resolution (e.g., introducing many detailed biochemical parameters) may come at the expense of model scope (e.g., the ability to address all biological elements and generalize to new patient cohorts). Visible machine learning offers two advantages in building intelligent models of biomedical systems. First, prior knowledge of biological structure can address the problem of data heterogeneity, since different input patterns, even when entirely distinct from one another (i.e., without common patterns), converge on common higher-order biological processing units corresponding to discrete modular components of cells and tissues. All machine-learning systems perform this type of data compression, or dimensionality reduction. In black-box models, the configuration of hidden layers that is required for sufficient data compression is inferred during the training procedure, typically requiring very large quantities of training data. In contrast, direct incorporation of the biological structure of cells and tissues, such as explored by Lin et al., 2017Lin C. Jain S. Kim H. Bar-Joseph Z. Using neural networks for reducing the dimensions of single-cell RNA-Seq data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: e156Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar and Ma et al., 2018Ma J. Yu M.K. Fong S. Ono K. Sage E. Demchak B. Sharan R. Ideker T. Using deep learning to model the hierarchical structure and function of a cell.Nat. Methods. 2018; 15: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, leads to a ready-made working model of how biological inputs, such as genotype, are compressed to determine outcomes. Second, models guided by biological structure can be interpreted mechanistically, informing our understanding of the system and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies. Given input patient data, execution of the model not only produces a final output state; it also reveals the states of internal biological systems. The most striking of these internal states provide hypotheses as to the underlying mechanisms governing patient phenotype, which is important because many internal biological states are difficult to measure through direct experimental observations. For example, Alvarez et al., 2016Alvarez M.J. Shen Y. Giorgi F.M. Lachmann A. Ding B.B. Ye B.H. Califano A. Functional characterization of somatic mutations in cancer using network-based inference of protein activity.Nat. Genet. 2016; 48: 838-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar used a transcriptional regulatory network to translate patient mRNA expression profiles to activities of regulatory proteins, most of which are difficult to interrogate experimentally. Internal states of the model may also indicate biological components that can be targeted by therapeutic interventions or form the basis for in silico testing of treatment combinations. We conclude with a short summary of milestones that research in visible machine learning might seek to achieve in the relatively near term. First is the advent of diverse algorithms to inform machine-learning systems with prior knowledge of biological structure, along with rigorous testing and validation of such algorithms. These developments may involve the application of existing mathematical approaches, require new frameworks, or both. Second, advances in our understanding of complexity are needed to assess and quantify complexity in biological systems and how it differs across the spectrum of tasks to be addressed by biomedical machine learning models. Third, investments in large-scale experimental biology will greatly expand the type and coverage of data that are available to map biological structures within cells and tissues. Generation of such data may involve new technology development to increase experimental throughput, such as advances in 3D cellular imaging or protein interaction mapping, or scale-up of existing technologies. Fourth, significant advances in computation infrastructure are needed to create high performance computing environments, along with web resources for community model development and distribution. Finally, early routes should be sought for embedding visible machine learning models in the clinic to begin evaluating best practices and validating efficacy for predicting patient outcomes and therapies within and across institutions. Notably, funding agencies have begun to promote research into some of these milestones (e.g., the NIH Data Commons or the DARPA Explainable Artificial Intelligence program), although not always with a focus on biomedicine. Parallel development of these directions will enable a new generation of biomedical machine learning, replacing black-box models that focus on isolated problem domains with visible models that survey general biological systems.

https://openalex.org/W2808298553,"Summary The ribonucleolytic RNA exosome interacts with RNA helicases to degrade RNA. To understand how the 3′ to 5′ Mtr4 helicase engages RNA and the nuclear exosome, we reconstituted 14-subunit Mtr4-containing RNA exosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and human and show that they unwind structured substrates to promote degradation. We loaded a human exosome with an optimized DNA-RNA chimera that stalls MTR4 during unwinding and determined its structure to an overall resolution of 3.45 A by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). The structure reveals an RNA-engaged helicase atop the non-catalytic core, with RNA captured within the central channel and DIS3 exoribonuclease active site. MPP6 tethers MTR4 to the exosome through contacts to the RecA domains of MTR4. EXOSC10 remains bound to the core, but its catalytic module and cofactor C1D are displaced by RNA-engaged MTR4. Competition for the exosome core may ensure that RNA is committed to degradation by DIS3 when engaged by MTR4."
https://openalex.org/W2808675327,"The mechanisms of fear attenuation Surprisingly little is known about how remote fearful memories are stored and attenuated. Khalaf et al. used independent fear memory attenuation paradigms, engram-based tagging techniques, and chemogenetic tools to alter neuronal activity (see the Perspective by Frankland and Josselyn). They found that a discrete subset of neurons within an ensemble is engaged during recall after memory attenuation, which correlated with fear reduction. Memory updating and extinction mechanisms thus likely coexist to make this happen. These findings support the notion that effective memory attenuation is mediated by a rewriting of the original memory trace of fear toward one of safety.

Three analyses were conducted: 1) Incidence rates were compared according to 25(OH)D concentration from <20 to ≥60 ng/ml (<50 to ≥150 nmol/L), 2) Kaplan-Meier plots were developed and 3) multivariate Cox regression was used to examine the association between 25(OH)D and breast cancer risk using multiple 25(OH)D measurements.Within the pooled cohort (N = 5038), 77 women were diagnosed with breast cancer (age-adjusted incidence: 512 cases per 100,000 person-years). Results were similar for the three analyses. First, comparing incidence rates, there was an 82% lower incidence rate of breast cancer for women with 25(OH)D concentrations ≥60 vs <20 ng/ml (Rate Ratio = 0.18, P = 0.006). Second, Kaplan-Meier curves for concentrations of <20, 20-39, 40-59 and ≥60 ng/ml were significantly different (P = 0.02), with the highest proportion breast cancer-free in the ≥60 ng/ml group (99.3%) and the lowest proportion breast cancer-free in the <20 ng/ml group (96.8%). The proportion with breast cancer was 78% lower for ≥60 vs <20 ng/ml (P = 0.02). Third, multivariate Cox regression revealed that women with 25(OH)D concentrations ≥60 ng/ml had an 80% lower risk of breast cancer than women with concentrations <20 ng/ml (HR = 0.20, P = 0.03), adjusting for age, BMI, smoking status, calcium supplement intake, and study of origin.Higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with a dose-response decrease in breast cancer risk with concentrations ≥60 ng/ml being most protective."

EMT enables cells to become motile and migrate directionally, and this behavior is often accompanied by the cells' ability to invade through extracellular matrices (1Lamouille S. Xu J. Derynck R. Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 (24556840): 178-19610.1038/nrm3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). EMT is marked by and depends on the expression and activities of one or several “master” EMT transcription factors that direct many of the changes in gene expression but also depends on a variety of nontranscriptional changes, including changes in cytoskeletal and membrane organization and dynamics. The EMT process results from a convergence of signaling pathways and is often seen to be driven by, or at a minimum to depend on, TGF-β signaling (2Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Cell Res. 2009; 19 (19153598): 156-17210.1038/cr.2009.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). In this context, activation of TGF-β signaling leads to destabilization of epithelial gene expression and phenotype and activates the expression of key EMT transcription factors such as Snail and Slug/Snail2 while also directing changes in the expression of many other genes (1Lamouille S. Xu J. Derynck R. Molecular mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15 (24556840): 178-19610.1038/nrm3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar, 2Xu J.

The EMT process plays crucial roles at many stages of tissue differentiation and development but also drives essential steps in pathological conditions, predominantly in cancer progression of carcinomas, and in fibrosis (1Lamouille S.

The EMT process has also been intricately associated with the epithelial stem-cell state as it promotes or accompanies stem cell–like features in both normal epithelial and carcinoma cells (3Polyak K.

Thus, activation of genes encoding EMT transcription factors promotes the generation of cancer stem cells. For example, activation of ZEB1 is required for the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic, colorectal, and breast cancer cells (5Chaffer C.L. Marjanovic N.D. Lee T. Bell G. Kleer C.G. Reinhardt F.

The ability of TGF-β to activate and drive the EMT program, or any differentiation program, results primarily from the activities of TGF-β–activated SMAD3 as the major effector. Following ligand binding to the cell-surface TGF-β receptor complex, the type I receptor C-terminally phosphorylates and thus activates SMAD2 and SMAD3, which then form heteromeric complexes with SMAD4, translocate into the nucleus, and cooperate with DNA-binding transcription factors in the activation or repression of TGF-β/SMAD target genes (12Xu P. Lin X. Feng X.H. Posttranslational regulation of Smads.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2016; 8 (27908935): a02208710.1101/cshperspect.a022087Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In EMT, TGF-β–activated SMAD3 activates the expression of Snail and Slug, as well as other EMT transcription factors, and then cooperates with these EMT transcription factors to induce or repress their target genes, thus initiating changes in gene expression that lead to transcriptome reprogramming and differentiation (2Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Cell Res. 2009; 19 (19153598): 156-17210.1038/cr.2009.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). The SMAD-initiated gene reprogramming is complemented by non-SMAD signaling pathways that are activated by TGF-β and/or other classes of ligands and receptors and contribute to the loss of epithelial phenotype and to the behavior that characterize EMT (2Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Cell Res. 2009; 19 (19153598): 156-17210.1038/cr.2009.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). In addition to the effector SMADs SMAD2 and SMAD3, that direct changes in expression, the cells express inhibitory SMADs. These interact with the type I receptor as well as the effector SMADs, thus preventing SMAD activation, but are also thought to directly repress SMAD-mediated activation of target genes. SMAD6 and SMAD7 inhibit the activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 in response to TGF-β and of SMAD1 and SMAD5 in the responses to the TGF-β–related bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). SMAD6 preferentially inhibits BMP signaling, whereas SMAD7 inhibits TGF-β signaling more efficiently than SMAD6 (13Miyazawa K. Miyazono K. Regulation of TGF-β family signaling by inhibitory Smads.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2017; 9 (27920040): a02209510.1101/cshperspect.a022095Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) methylate arginine residues in histones and thus control epigenetically the expression of an array of genes; however, they also modify nonhistone proteins, including signaling mediators, and thus control their functions. Among the PRMTs, PRMT1 is the most abundant and is responsible for 75% of all arginine methylation in cells (14Bedford M.T. Clarke S.G. Protein arginine methylation in mammals: who, what, and why.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33 (19150423): 1-1310.1016/j.molcel.2008.12.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Besides the common histone 4 methylation at Arg-3, PRMT1 methylates and functionally regulates an extensive variety of proteins, including components of several signaling pathways (15Blanc R.S. Richard S. Arginine methylation: the coming of age.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65 (28061334): 8-2410.1016/j.molcel.2016.11.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Increased PRMT1 expression has been observed in a variety of carcinomas, including breast carcinomas, and has been correlated with tumor growth and cancer progression and metastasis (16Yang Y. Bedford M.T. Protein arginine methyltransferases and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13 (23235912): 37-5010.1038/nrc3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We reported that PRMT1 is required for BMP signaling activation. BMP induces PRMT1, in association with the type II BMP receptor (BMPRII), to methylate SMAD6 associated with the type I BMP receptor (BMPRI), leading to dissociation of methylated SMAD6 from the BMP receptor complex and enabling activation of the effector SMADs SMAD1 and SMAD5 (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

We now provide evidence that PRMT1 is also a critical mediator of TGF-β signaling through methylation of SMAD7, which complements SMAD6 methylation. PRMT1 is required for TGF-β–induced SMAD3 activation, through a similar mechanism as shown for BMP-induced SMAD6 methylation, and thus promotes TGF-β–induced EMT as well as epithelial stem-cell generation. This study defines a novel signaling pathway, from TGF-β through PRMT1 onto SMAD7, that controls EMT and epithelial stem-cell maintenance through arginine methylation. To evaluate whether PRMT1 controls TGF-β–induced SMAD activation, we silenced PRMT1 expression in human skin epithelial HaCaT cells using transfected siRNAs that target the expression of all PRMT1 isoforms. Silencing PRMT1 mRNA expression with >95% efficiency dramatically decreased the TGF-β–induced activation of SMAD3, detected by immunoblotting for C-terminally phosphorylated SMAD3 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, silencing PRMT1 expression repressed the TGF-β–induced mRNA expression of known TGF-β/SMAD3 target genes such as the genes encoding plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1) (Fig. 1B) or SMAD7 (Fig. 1C). A similar inhibition of TGF-β responsiveness was apparent in human mammary epithelial (HMLE) cells. In these cells, silencing PRMT1 expression also impaired TGF-β–induced SMAD3 activation (Fig. 1D) and repressed TGF-β–induced PAI1 and SMAD7 mRNA expression (Fig. 1, E and F). These observations strongly suggest that PRMT1 is required for TGF-β–induced activation of SMAD3. We reported that PRMT1 facilitates BMP signaling through its ability to methylate SMAD6, resulting in its dissociation from the type I receptor, and thus enables BMP-induced SMAD1/5 activation (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

Because PRMT1 is also required for TGF-β–induced SMAD3 activation (Fig. 1) and SMAD7, in addition to SMAD6, inhibits TGF-β signaling (18Feng X.H. Derynck R. Specificity and versatility in TGF-β signaling through Smads.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21 (16212511): 659-69310.1146/annurev.cellbio.21.022404.142018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether PRMT1 methylates SMAD7, thus complementing the BMP-induced methylation of SMAD6 (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

For this purpose, we evaluated by in vivo [3H]methylation whether TGF-β signaling induces SMAD7 methylation. This was indeed the case as shown in transfected HaCaT epithelial cells. In the absence of TGF-β signaling, i.e. in the presence of the type I TGF-β receptor kinase inhibitor SB431542, SMAD7 showed a low level of [3H]methylation, and TGF-β treatment enhanced the [3H]methylation of SMAD7, which was blocked by the general methyltransferase inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde (Fig. 2A). TGF-β also induced methylation of SMAD6, which could be probed using specific antibodies against either of the two dimethylated Arg residues (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

The increased methylation of SMAD6 and SMAD7 in response to TGF-β is consistent with the notion that both SMAD6 and SMAD7 act as inhibitory SMADs in TGF-β signaling (18Feng X.H. Derynck R. Specificity and versatility in TGF-β signaling through Smads.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21 (16212511): 659-69310.1146/annurev.cellbio.21.022404.142018Crossref PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). The [3H]methylation of endogenous SMAD7 could not be visualized due to the low level of SMAD7 expression, the limited quality of available SMAD7 antibodies, and the long exposures required to visualize [3H]methylated SMAD7. SMAD7 expressed in transfected 293T cells was also [3H]methylated, but its methylation was not enhanced in response to TGF-β, which is consistent with their low levels of TGF-β receptors and their poor responsiveness to TGF-β (data not shown). SMAD7 [3H]methylation was decreased when the expression of PRMT1 was silenced using shRNA (Fig. 2C). Our previous findings on the role of PRMT1 in BMP signaling led to the model that PRMT1 associates with the BMP type II receptor, whereas SMAD6 binds to the BMP type I receptor, and that BMP-induced receptor heteromerization promotes PRMT1 interaction with SMAD6 and consequently SMAD6 methylation by PRMT1 (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

We hypothesized that a similar model holds for PRMT1-mediated SMAD7 methylation in TGF-β signaling and therefore examined the interaction of PRMT1 with the TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) and TβRI. In transfected 293T cells, PRMT1 interacted with TβRII but not with the WT type I receptor (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). Thr-204 replacement by Asp is known to confer a partial activation of TβRI, leading to SMAD2/3 activation (19Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massagué J. GS domain mutations that constitutively activate TβR-I, the downstream signaling component in the TGF-β receptor complex.EMBO J. 1995; 14 (7774578): 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), which is thought to depend on autocrine TGF-β binding to endogenous TβRII. In contrast to the lack of PRMT1 association with WT TβRI, PRMT1 associated with the mutant constitutively activated TβRI (TβRIca) (Fig. 2D, lane 4), which may result from its association with endogenous TβRII. Coexpression of TβRII and TβRIca, thus promoting TβRII–TβRI heteromerization, illustrated the predominant association of PRMT1 with TβRII in the receptor complexes (Fig. 2D, lane 5). This scenario is similar to the recruitment of PRMT1 to the heteromeric BMP receptor complexes, although no PRMT1 association with the activated BMPRI was seen (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol. Cell. 2013; 51 (23747011): 5-1910.1016/j.molcel.2013.05.004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consistent with this scenario of PRMT1 interaction with TβRII and its recruitment in the TβRII–TβRI complex, introduction of the TβRIca mutant in HaCaT cells resulted in enhanced SMAD7 methylation (Fig. 2E). To define the sites in SMAD7 that are methylated by PRMT1, we first studied SMAD7 methylation in vitro. Deletion analyses revealed that PRMT1 methylates SMAD7 in its N-terminal region that spans amino acids 1–89 but not in the remaining large segment that comprises its MH2 domain and spans amino acids 90–427 (Fig. 3A). As a control for the activity of PRMT1 in vitro, PRMT1 methylated histone 4 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). To identify the residues of SMAD7 that are methylated by PRMT1 in vivo, we carried out mutagenesis analyses, focusing on Arg residues that are adjacent to Gly and thus represent the preferred methylation sites of PRMT1 (20Thandapani P. O'Connor T.R. Bailey T.L. Richard S. Defining the RGG/RG motif.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50 (23746349): 613-62310.1016/j.molcel.2013.05.021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). SMAD7 mutants, in which each of these arginines within the first 89 amino acids was individually replaced by alanine, were expressed in 293T cells, and their methylation was evaluated by in vivo [3H]methylation and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). These analyses revealed that the R57A and R67A substitutions strongly decreased the methylation of SMAD7 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that these two arginine residues may be methylated. Substitutions of both Arg-57 and Arg-67 with alanine or lysine confirmed the decreased SMAD7 methylation when compared with WT SMAD7 but did not show a cumulative decrease of [3H]methylation (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, silencing PRMT1 expression did not further decrease the [3H]methylation of the double-mutant SMAD7 and kept it at a level comparable with the [3H]methylation of WT SMAD7 following PRMT1 silencing (Fig. 3D). We also analyzed by MS the methylation of SMAD7 that was expressed in transfected 293T cells treated with TGF-β for 1 h and isolated by immunoaffinity purification. Mono- and dimethylation of Arg-57 of SMAD7 was detected in multiple independent samples (Fig. 3, E and F). However, we did not detect methylation of Arg-67 in these assays. This inability to detect Arg-67 methylation has limited value as a negative result but may suggest that in our methylation assays (Fig. 3, B–D) Arg-67 is required to enable Arg-57 methylation or that Arg-67 methylation occurs at a later stage of TGF-β signaling, i.e. after 1 h. MS also revealed lysine methylation of SMAD7, which is the subject of a separate study (data not shown), and explains the persistent [3H]methylation of SMAD7 after silencing PRMT1 expression (Fig. 3D). Further drawing on the parallel with the role of SMAD6 methylation in BMP signaling, we reported that BMP-induced methylation of SMAD6 decreases the SMAD6 association with the BMPRI, thus enabling SMAD6 dissociation from the activated BMPRI (17Xu J.

By analogy, we examined whether arginine methylation by PRMT1 decreases the association efficiency of SMAD7 for TβRI using an in vitro binding assay (Fig. 4A). For this purpose, purified GST-SMAD7, methylated in vitro by PRMT1, was compared with unmethylated GST-SMAD7 for binding to immobilized, His-tagged TβRIca with its activating T204D mutation that was purified from transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4B). Unmethylated SMAD7 showed efficient binding to TβRIca (Fig. 4B, right lane), whereas methylated SMAD7 associated with a lower efficiency, apparent by the higher abundance of SMAD7 in the unbound fraction (Fig. 4B, left lane). These results provide evidence that arginine methylation decreases the binding of SMAD7 to the activated TβRI as was seen for the binding of SMAD6 to BMPRI (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

These results therefore suggest that SMAD7 methylation by PRMT1 enables SMAD7 dissociation from the activated TβRI receptor, similar to the effect of SMAD6 methylation leading to SMAD6 dissociation from the BMPRI receptor. Supporting this notion, increasing PRMT1 expression decreased the interaction of SMAD7 with TβRIca (Fig. 4C), again as observed for the binding of SMAD6 to BMPRI (17Xu J. Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

Wang A.H. Oses-Prieto J. Makhijani K. Katsuno Y. Pei M. Yan L. Zheng Y.G. Burlingame A. Brückner K. Derynck R. Arginine methylation initiates BMP-induced Smad signaling.Mol.

Protein methylation often alters protein stability, thus controlling the half-life of proteins. To determine whether Arg methylation controls the stability of SMAD7, we examined the half-life of SMAD7 in cycloheximide chase experiments in the presence and absence of PRMT1 (Fig. 4D). The estimated half-life of SMAD7 in control HaCaT cells was 38 min, whereas, following PRMT1 silencing, the estimated half-life was extended to 4 h, indicating that PRMT1-mediated methylation promotes degradation of SMAD7. Together, these data suggest that TGF-β–induced methylation of SMAD7 by TβRII-associated PRMT1 results in dissociation of SMAD7 from the TβRI receptor and subsequent degradation of SMAD7. TGF-β signaling is known to repress the epithelial-cell phenotype and, depending on the cell system and physiological conditions, to induce an EMT. In TGF-β–induced EMT, SMAD3 activates the expression of EMT master transcription factors such as Snail and cooperates with these transcription factors in the repression of epithelial genes and activation of mesenchymal genes (2Xu J. Lamouille S. Derynck R. TGF-β-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition.Cell Res. 2009; 19 (19153598): 156-17210.1038/cr.2009.5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells are often used as model system to study the changes in gene expression during EMT. Considering the role of PRMT1 in the control of TGF-β–induced SMAD3 activation, we examined its role in TGF-β–induced EMT of HaCaT cells. TGF-β induced a loss of the cobblestone-like cell shape that characterizes the epithelial identity and induced a more elongated EMT-like cell phenotype (Fig. 5A) with actin stress fibers rather than cortical actin organization, decreased E-cadherin immunostaining at cell junctions, decreased Claudin1 expression, and increased Vimentin expression (Fig. 5, B and C). Silencing PRMT1 expression using transfected siRNA inhibited this loss of epithelial phenotype (Fig. 5, A and B) and largely prevented these changes (Figs. 5, B and C, and S1). A similar role for PRMT1 was observed in the differentiation of HMLE cells. In these cells, TGF-β also induces a morphological transition from a cobblestone-like phenotype to a more elongated phenotype (Fig. 5D), although this transition in phenotype requires a longer time than in HaCaT cells. Silencing PRMT1 expression through lentiviral expression of either of two shRNAs inhibited this morphological transition (Fig. 5D"

Little is known about the training adaptations that occur as a prolonged training program. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in body composition, bone metabolism, strength, and skill-specific performance over 16-weeks of HIFT. Twenty-six recreationally active adult males (n = 9; 34.2 ± 9.1 y; 91.5 ± 17.7 kg; 178.5 ± 5.4 cm) and females (n = 17 = 36.4 ± 7.9 y; 91.5 ± 17.7 kg; 162.9 ± 7.0 cm) completed pre and post training assessments of body composition (Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry) and performance measures. Performance was assessed using three HIFT workouts (WOD 1-3) to assess strength, skill, and metabolic performance. Aside from the body composition measurements, all assessments were carried out at the local training facility. Training included participation in HIFT a minimum of twice a week for 16-weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant gender x time interaction in Bone Mineral Content (BMC) (p = 0.027), where improvements favored women (1.0% ± 1.1%, p = 0.004) over men (-0.1% + 0.8%, p = 0.625). Further, region-specific analysis indicated that women (2.5% ± 3.0%, p < 0.005) experienced greater improvements in the trunk compared to men (-0.3% ± 1.8%, p = 0.621), while changes in leg BMC were comparable between women (0.8% ± 1.0%, p < 0.001) and men (0.3% ± 0.6%, p < 0.001). Although no other interactions were observed, significant performance improvements were noted for all participants in WOD 1 (18.3% ± 16.8%), absolute 5RM (14.4% ± 9.7%), relative 5RM (15.4% ± 9.2%), WOD 2 (5.7% ± 6.5%), and WOD 3 (-17.3% ± 14.7%). These data indicate that 16-weeks of HIFT resulted in positive outcomes in strength, metabolic conditioning performance, and body composition."
https://openalex.org/W2808039033,"Disseminated castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a common disease in men that is characterized by limited survival and resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy. The increase in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signaling contributes to androgen receptor activity in a subset of patients with CRPC; however, enigmatically, HER2-targeted therapies have demonstrated a lack of efficacy in patients with CRPC. Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer and involves key processes that support cancer progression. Using transcriptomic analysis of prostate cancer data sets, histopathologic examination of clinical specimens, and in vivo experiments of xenograft models, we reveal in this study a coordinated increase in glycan-binding protein, galectin-4, specific glycosyltransferases of core 1 synthase, glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-β-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1GALT1) and ST3 β-galactoside α-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 (ST3GAL1), and resulting mucin-type O-glycans during the progression of CRPC. Furthermore, galectin-4 engaged with C1GALT1-dependent O-glycans to promote castration resistance and metastasis by activating receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and cancer cell sternness properties mediated by SRY-box 9 (SOX9). This galectin-glycan interaction up-regulated the MYC-dependent expression of C1GALT1 and ST3GAL1, which altered cellular mucin-type O-glycosylation to allow for galectin-4 binding. In clinical prostate cancer, high-level expression of C1GALT1 and galectin-4 together predict poor overall survival compared with low-level expression of C1GALT1 and galectin-4. In summary, MYC regulates abnormal O-glycosylation, thus priming cells for binding to galectin-4 and downstream signaling, which promotes castration resistance and metastasis.—Tzeng, S.-F., Tsai, C.-H., Chao, T.-K., Chou, Y.-C., Yang, Y.-C., Tsai, M.-H., Cha, T.-L., Hsiao, P.-W.

https://openalex.org/W2950657649,"Cancer cells have been found to frequently express genes that are normally restricted to the testis, often referred to as cancer/testis (CT) antigens or genes. Because germ cell-specific antigens are not recognized as ""self"" by the innate immune system, CT-genes have previously been suggested as ideal candidate targets for cancer therapy. The use of CT-genes in cancer therapy has thus far been unsuccessful, most likely because their identification has relied on gene expression in whole testis, including the testicular somatic cells, precluding the detection of true germ cell-specific genes. By comparing the transcriptomes of micro-dissected germ cell subtypes, representing the main developmental stages of human spermatogenesis, with the publicly accessible transcriptomes of 2617 samples from 49 different healthy somatic tissues and 9232 samples from 33 tumor types, we here discover hundreds of true germ cell-specific cancer expressed genes. Strikingly, we found these germ cell cancer genes (GC-genes) to be widely expressed in all analyzed tumors. Many GC-genes appeared to be involved in processes that are likely to actively promote tumor viability, proliferation and metastasis. Targeting these true GC-genes thus has the potential to inhibit tumor growth with infertility being the only possible side effect. Moreover, we identified a subset of GC-genes that are not expressed in spermatogonial stem cells. Targeting of this GC-gene subset is predicted to only lead to temporary infertility, as untargeted spermatogonial stem cells can recover spermatogenesis after treatment. Our GC-gene dataset enables improved understanding of tumor biology and provides multiple novel targets for cancer treatment."

In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive investigation to explore how the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein p17 performs specific duties in the nucleus and the cytoplasm to suppress the formation of active CDK–cyclin complexes. Findings from the current study provide mechanistic insights into p17-modulated inhibition of the formation of active CDK–cyclin complexes in the nucleus by transcriptional down-regulation of CDKs, cytoplasmic retention of CDKs and cyclins, and enhancement of p53 and cyclin H interaction to suppress CDK7 activity. Importantly, our findings suggest that the PSTAIRE motif of CDK1 is not required for interaction with cyclin B1, but the PSTAIRE motif is critical for other cell cycle CDK–cyclin complexes (14.Morris M.C.

The LA and GADP sequences in this region are conserved in p17 and cyclin B1 (Fig. 1A). To examine whether the LA and GADP sequences in p17 are important for competing with cyclin B1 for CDK1 binding, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create three p17 mutants. p17 co-immunoprecipitated with CDK1 (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B), but not with cyclin B1 (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C). Mutation of Gly-34 minimally affected CDK1 binding of p17, but p17Δ25A had no effect (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1D). Mutation of Asp-36 caused a significant loss of binding (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1C). To rule out the possibility of overexpression artifacts, GST pulldown assays were carried out. To perform GST pulldown assays, fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and analyzed (Fig. S1D and Table S1). GST pulldown assays revealed that p17 directly interacts with CDK1, but the p17D36A mutant has weak association (Fig. 1E), suggesting that Asp-36 is essential for p17 and CDK1 interaction. Furthermore, to investigate whether other acidic residues in p17 are involved in CDK1 binding, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create three additional p17 mutants. We discovered that mutations of other conserved acidic residues Glu-84 and Asp-86 in p17 also caused a dramatic loss of binding, but mutation at Lys-122 and Asp-143 had no effect (Fig. 1E). Thus, we have identified several conserved acidic residues in p17 that form a negatively charged pocket required for CDK1 binding (Fig. S1E). Importantly, several conserved basic residues in CDK1 are predicted by PyMOL software analysis to form a positively charged pocket in the N lobe of CDK1 (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1F). To test whether this positively charged pocket in CDK1 interacts with the negatively charged pocket in p17, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create three CDK1 mutants (K6/9A, K34A/R36A, and R75A) (Fig. S1D). GST pulldown assays revealed that mutations of these basic residues caused a significant loss of p17 interaction, as did simultaneous mutation of both p17 and CDK1 (Fig. 1, H and I). All CDK1 and p17 mutants showed weak interaction (35% or less; Fig. 1J). To further confirm whether p17 mimics the GADP motif in cyclin B1 for competing with CDK1 binding, we conducted similar experiments with a site-specific cyclin B1D163A mutant to examine the conserved residue in the GADP motif of cyclin B1 (Fig. 1A). To perform GST pulldown assays, fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and analyzed (Fig. S2A and Table S1). This mutant has impaired ability to bind CDK1 compared with the WT cyclin B1 (Fig. S2B), suggesting that Asp-163 is required for CDK1 binding. To investigate whether other acidic residues in the negatively charged 151LAVXDVDA(E/D)DGADPN165 motif in cyclin B1 are involved in CDK1 binding, site-directed mutagenesis was used to create three cyclin B1 mutants (D155A, D157A, and E159A/D160A). Mutations of these conserved acidic residues also affected cyclin B1 interaction with CDK1 (Fig. S2B). Furthermore, simultaneous mutation of both CDK1 and cyclin B1 severely impaired their interaction (down to 8–50%; Fig. 2A and Fig. S2C). In vitro kinase assays revealed that CDK1 and cyclin B1 mutants dramatically reduce phosphorylation of vimentin (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these observations highlight the importance of the negatively charged 151LAVXDVDA(E/D)DGADPN165 motif in cyclin B1 for interaction with the positively charged pocket in CDK1. The corresponding interaction sites in p17, CDK1, and cyclin B1 are summarized in Table 1.Table 1Interaction of p17 with CDKs, cyclins, and CDK–cyclin complexesTarget proteinInteraction with p17Motif or key amino acid residues in p17Motif or key amino acid residues in CDKs or cyclinsKinmCDK1+++34GADP37, Glu-84, 86Lys-6, Lys-9, Lys-34, Arg-36, Arg-75aCritical residues for cyclin B1 or p17 interaction.105 (B1), 105 (A2)CDK2+++140WXFD143Lys-8940 (A2), 80 (E1)CDK4++Lys-122NDNDCDK6++Asp-113, Lys-122Glu-18/Glu-21125CDK7−Cyclin A1−Cyclin A2+++125RXL127Asp-283Cyclin B1−151LAVXDVDA(E/D)DGADPN165Cyclin D1+125RXL127Glu-66, Glu-70Cyclin D2−Cyclin D3−Cyclin E1++125RXL127Glu-154Cyclin H−CDK1–cyclin B1 complexcThe PSTAIRE region of CDK1 not involved in cyclin B1 interaction.−CDK1–cyclin A2 complexdThe PSTAIRE of CDK2, -4, and -6 involved in cyclin interaction.++>125CDK2–cyclin A2 complexdThe PSTAIRE of CDK2, -4, and -6 involved in cyclin interaction.++200CDK2–cyclin E1 complexdThe PSTAIRE of CDK2, -4, and -6 involved in cyclin interaction.+350CDK6–cyclin D1 complexdThe PSTAIRE of CDK2, -4, and -6 involved in cyclin interaction.+500b A critical motif for CDK1 interaction.a Critical residues for cyclin B1 or p17 interaction.c The PSTAIRE region of CDK1 not involved in cyclin B1 interaction.d The PSTAIRE of CDK2, -4, and -6 involved in cyclin interaction.

An in vitro kinase assay (12.Chiu H.C. Huang W.R. Liao T.L. Wu H.Y. Munir M. Shih W.L. Liu H.J. Suppression of vimentin phosphorylation by the avian reovirus p17 through inhibition of CDK1 and Plk1 impacting the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.PLoS One. 2016; 11 (27603133): e016235610.1371/journal.pone.0162356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) detected decreased levels of phosphorylated vimentin (Ser-56) by p17 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas controls had no effect (Fig. 3, A and B). The Ki value for inhibition of CDK1–cyclin B1 or CDK1–cyclin A2 complexes is about 105 nm (Fig. 3, A and B). Increasing concentrations of cyclin B1 in the CDK1–cyclin B1 complex led to increased kinase activity, whereas decreased kinase activity was correlated with increasing concentrations of p17 (Fig. 3A). After preincubation of p17 with CDK1, the Ki value was 60 nm, whereas no change was detected in cyclin B1 (Fig. 3B). The inhibitory effect of CDK1 by preincubation with p17 was higher compared with the simultaneous addition of p17, CDK1, and cyclin B1, indicating that p17 competes with cyclin B1 for CDK1 binding (Fig. 3A). The failure of cells to enter mitosis mediated by p17 results from inhibition of the kinase activity of the CDK1–cyclin B1 complex and inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 (12.Chiu H.C. Huang W.R. Liao T.L. Wu H.Y. Munir M. Shih W.L. Liu H.J. Suppression of vimentin phosphorylation by the avian reovirus p17 through inhibition of CDK1 and Plk1 impacting the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.PLoS One. 2016; 11 (27603133): e016235610.1371/journal.pone.0162356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining revealed a marked increase in CDK1 level in the cytoplasm in ARV-infected and p17-transfected Vero cells (an African green monkey kidney cell line) (Fig. 3D). However, the failure of the p17D36A mutant to sequester CDK1 in the cytoplasm correlated with lower binding ability of CDK1 (Fig. 1E). These results were further supported by Western blotting (Fig. 3E), which revealed that the CDK1 level in the cytoplasm increased 3-fold in p17-transfected Vero cells. p17 uses a novel strategy in which it competes with cyclin B1 for CDK1 binding and sequesters CDK1 in the cytoplasm, preventing the formation of active CDK1–cyclin B1 complex in the nucleus. To further support the finding that p17 competes with cyclin B1 for CDK1 binding, we carried out complex formation assays (Fig. 4A). The formation of the CDK1–cyclin B1 complex was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). We found that p17 is unable to bind the preassembled CDK1–cyclin B1 complex (Fig. 4C), further confirming our conclusion. Taken together, our results revealed that p17 binds CDK1, but not cyclin B1 or the CDK1–cyclin B1 complex. The formation of CDK1–cyclin A2, CDK1K34A/R36A–cyclin 2, and cyclin A2–CDK1K34A/R36A complexes was detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4, B and D). The CDK1K34A/R36A mutant has reduced ability to interact with cyclin B1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, mutations at Lys-34 and Arg-36 in CDK1 did not affect CDK1–cyclin A2 complex formation, suggesting that CDK1 interacts differently with specific cyclin B1 and cyclin A2 residues. Furthermore, p17 exhibits binding specificity for the preassembled CDK1–cyclin A2 complex, and the Ki value for inhibition of CDK1–cyclin A2 was about 125 nm (Fig. 4E). Based on our findings, we propose models for interaction of p17 with CDK1–cyclin B1 and CDK1–cyclin A2 complexes (Fig. 4F). The first model explains how p17 inhibits formation of the CDK1–cyclin B1 complex. The second model indicates that inhibition of CDK–cyclin A2 kinase activity occurs through direct binding of p17 to CDK1, cyclin A2, or the complexes. It has been demonstrated that Ile-49/Arg-50 in the PRTAIRE domain of CDK2 directly interacts with cyclin A (14.Morris M.C. Gondeau C. Tainer J.A. Divita G.

Furthermore, several reports predicted that CDK1 is activated by residue Ile-49 in CDK1 interacting with residue Tyr-258 of cyclin B1 (16.McGrath C.F. Pattabiraman N. Kellogg G.E. Lemcke T. Kunick C.

However, due to technical difficulties, such as poor expression and the insolubility of recombinant cyclin B1, these groups used a human cyclin B1ΔN165 mutant for crystal structure determination and prediction of CDK1–cyclin B1 interaction (17.Petri E.T.

Surprisingly, our data revealed that mutations I49A and R50A in CDK1 retained strong binding ability with cyclin B1 or cyclin B1Y258A, and CDK1 did not lose its kinase activity (Fig. 5A and Fig. S2A). Our findings contrast with previous conclusions that the PSTAIRE motif is required for interaction with CDK1–cyclin B1. Notably, mutations in CDK2 or CDK6 profoundly reduced their ability to bind partner cyclins and inhibited their kinase activity (Fig. 5, B and C). A similar trend was also found in CDK1–cyclin A2 (Fig. 5, B and C). Although the positively charged pocket in CDK1 lies very close to the PSTAIRE region, we show that the pocket is distinct from the PSTAIRE region (Fig. 5D). Taken together, our data confirm that the PSTAIRE region of CDK1 is not directly involved in the interaction with cyclin B1, but the PSTAIRE region of CDK2 and CDK6 is crucial for interaction with partner cyclins. By alignment of p17, p21CIP1, and p27KIP1 sequences (19.Nakanishi M. Robetorye R.S. Adami G.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R.

We found that p17 bears resemblance to cyclin-binding sequences (125RXL127 motif) in the CIP/KIP family (21.Chen J. Saha P. Kornbluth S. Dynlacht B.D. Dutta A.

Both 140WXFD143 and 125RXL127 motifs were conserved in p17 across different strains (Fig. S1E) (22.Liu H.J. Lee L.H. Hsu H.W. Kuo L.C. Liao M.H.

Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that p17 and the p1727–146 mutant interact with CDK2, cyclin A2, and cyclin E1 but not cyclin A1 (Fig. S3, A–C). Fusion proteins were expressed, purified, and analyzed (Fig. S3D and Table S1). GST pulldown assays revealed that the 140WXFD143 and 125RXL127 motifs of p17 are critical for CDK2 and cyclin binding (Fig. S3, E–G). Mutagenesis analysis suggested that CDK2K89, cyclin A2D283, and cyclin E1E154 are required for p17 interaction, whereas cyclin A2E220 and cyclin E1D218 are not involved (Fig. S3, F and G). The binding abilities of p17 and mutants are shown in Fig. 6B. Mutations at Asp-36 and Lys-122 in p17 (critical for CDK1 or CDK6 interaction) have no effect on the p17–CDK2 interaction (Fig. S3H). These residues of CDK2 and cyclins are conserved across different species (Fig. S3I). All p17, CDK2, cyclin A2, and cyclin E mutants showed weak interaction (40% or less; Fig. 6B). Taken together, our results demonstrate that p17 interacts directly with CDK2, cyclin A2, and cyclin E1. With increasing concentrations of p17, a dose-dependent decrease in levels of phosphorylated Rb (Ser-249) was observed (Fig. 6C). The Ki value for inhibition of CDK2–cyclin A2 or CDK2–cyclin E1 by p17 was 40 and 80 nm, respectively (Fig. 6, C and D). Mutations at Arg-125, Trp-140, Phe-142, and Asp-143 in p17 attenuated binding to cyclins (A2 and E1) or CDK2 (Fig. 6, C and D). The addition of BSA to the mixture had no effect on Rb phosphorylation. Preincubation of p17 with either CDK2 or cyclins (A2 and E1) resulted in Ki values of 60 and 125 nm, respectively (Fig. S4, A and B). The inhibitory effect on CDK2 was moderately reduced compared with the simultaneous addition of p17, CDK2, and cyclins, implying that p17 interferes with formation of CDK2–cyclin A2 and CDK2–cyclin E1 complexes, which reduces its effect on the inhibition of Rb kinase activity of CDK2. Similar to CDK1 sequestration by p17, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the majority of CDK2, cyclin A2, and cyclin E1 are associated with p17 in the cytoplasm (Fig. S4, C, E, and G) in p17-transfected and ARV-infected Vero cells.

In practice, diagnostic tests, clinical case definitions and vaccination records often present inaccuracies, leading to biased VE estimates. Previous studies investigated the impact of non-differential disease misclassification on VE estimation.We explored, through simulation, the impact of non-differential and differential disease- and exposure misclassification when estimating VE using cohort, case-control, test-negative case-control and case-cohort designs. The impact of misclassification on the estimated VE is demonstrated for VE studies on childhood seasonal influenza and pertussis vaccination. We additionally developed a web-application graphically presenting bias for user-selected parameters.Depending on the scenario, the misclassification parameters had differing impacts. Decreased exposure specificity had greatest impact for influenza VE estimation when vaccination coverage was low. Decreased exposure sensitivity had greatest impact for pertussis VE estimation for which high vaccination coverage is typically achieved. The impact of the exposure misclassification parameters was found to be more noticeable than that of the disease misclassification parameters. When misclassification is limited, all study designs perform equally. In case of substantial (differential) disease misclassification, the test-negative design performs worse.Misclassification can lead to significant bias in VE estimates and its impact strongly depends on the scenario. We developed a web-application for assessing the potential (joint) impact of possibly differential disease- and exposure misclassification that can be modified by users to their own study scenario. Our results and the simulation tool may be used to guide better design, conduct and interpretation of future VE studies."

In this study, the prevalence of microscopic and submicroscopic asexual and gametocyte parasite stages were assessed in asymptomatic children from two communities in southern Ghana. Eighty children aged twelve years and below, none of whom exhibited signs of clinical malaria living in Obom and Cape Coast were sampled twice, one during the rainy (July 2015) and subsequently during the dry (January 2016) season. Venous blood was used to prepare thick and thin blood smears, spot a rapid malaria diagnostic test (PfHRP2 RDT) as well as prepare filter paper blood spots. Blood cell pellets were preserved in Trizol for RNA extraction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and semi-quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine submicroscopic parasite prevalence. In both sites 87% (95% CI: 78–96) of the asymptomatic individuals surveyed were parasites positive during the 6 month study period. The prevalence of asexual and gametocyte stage parasites in the rainy season were both significantly higher in Obom than in Cape Coast (P < 0.001). Submicroscopic gametocyte prevalence was highest in the rainy season in Obom but in the dry season in Cape Coast. Parasite prevalence determined by PCR was similar to that determined by qRT-PCR in Obom but significantly lower than that determined by qRT-PCR in Cape Coast. Communities with varying parasite prevalence exhibit seasonal variations in the prevalence of gametocyte carriers. Submicroscopic asymptomatic parasite and gametocyte carriage is very high in southern Ghana, even during the dry season in communities with low microscopic parasite prevalence and likely to be missed during national surveillance exercises."
https://openalex.org/W2808448903,"Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation constitutes an important extracellular antimicrobial function of neutrophils that plays a protective role in bacterial pneumonia. Formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as highly diffusible hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a hallmark of oxidative stress during inflammatory lung conditions including pneumonia. However, the impact of exogenous ROS on NET formation and the signaling pathway involved in the process is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that the ROS-sensing, nonselective, calcium-permeable channel transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is required for NET formation in response to exogenous H2O2. This TRPM2-dependent H2O2-mediated NET formation involved components of autophagy and activation of AMPK and p38 MAPK, but not PI3K and AKT. Primary neutrophils from Trpm2-/- mice fail to activate this pathway with a block in NET release and a concomitant decrease in their antimicrobial capacity. Consequently, Trpm2-/- mice were highly susceptible to pneumonic infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae owing to an impaired NET formation and high bacterial burden despite increased neutrophil infiltration in their lungs. These results identify a key role of TRPM2 in regulating NET formation by exogenous ROS via AMPK/p38 activation and autophagy machinery, as well as a protective antimicrobial role of TRPM2 in pneumonic bacterial infection.-Tripathi, J.

https://openalex.org/W2807905526,"Macrophage infiltration is common to both emphysema and atherosclerosis, and cigarette smoke down-regulates the macrophage cholesterol efflux transporter ATP binding cassette (ABC)A1. This decreased cholesterol efflux results in lipid-laden macrophages. We hypothesize that cigarette smoke adversely affects cholesterol transport via an ABCA1-dependent mechanism in macrophages, enhancing TLR4/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) signaling and resulting in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) up-regulation and exacerbation of pulmonary inflammation. ABCA1 is significantly down-regulated in the lung upon smoke exposure conditions. Macrophages exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo and in vitro exhibit impaired cholesterol efflux correlating with significantly decreased ABCA1 expression, up-regulation of the TLR4/Myd88 pathway, and downstream MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression. Treatment with liver X receptor (LXR) agonist restores ABCA1 expression after short-term smoke exposure and attenuates the inflammatory response; after long-term smoke exposure, there is also attenuated physiologic and morphologic changes of emphysema. In vitro, treatment with LXR agonist decreases macrophage inflammatory activation in wild-type but not ABCA1 knockout mice, suggesting an ABCA1-dependent mechanism of action. These studies demonstrate an important association between cigarette smoke exposure and cholesterol-mediated pathways in the macrophage inflammatory response. Modulation of these pathways through manipulation of ABCA1 activity effectively blocks cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and provides a potential novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.-Sonett, J., Goldklang, M., Sklepkiewicz, P., Gerber, A., Trischler, J., Zelonina, T., Westerterp, M., Lemaître, V., Okada, V., D'Armiento, J.

Driver oncogenes, such as Kras are now appreciated for their ability to promote tumor growth via up-regulation of anabolic pathways. Therefore, we wanted to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in Kras-mutant lung cancer. Using the Kras LSL-G12D lung cancer model, we show that mutant Kras drives a lipogenic gene-expression program. Stable-isotope analysis reveals that mutant Kras promotes de novo fatty acid synthesis in vitro and in vivo. The importance of fatty acid synthesis in Kras-induced tumorigenesis was evident by decreased tumor formation in Kras LSL-G12D mice after treatment with a fatty acid synthesis inhibitor. Importantly, with gain and loss of function models of mutant Kras, we demonstrate that mutant Kras potentiates the growth inhibitory effects of several fatty acid synthesis inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2807940858,"Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a ubiquitous transcription factor found in eukaryotes. It is composed of three distinct subunits called NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. NF-Ys have been identified as key regulators of multiple pathways in the control of development and tolerance to biotic and abiotic factors. The present study aimed to identify and characterize the complete repertoire of genes coding for NF-Y in citrus, as well as to perform the functional characterization of one of its members, namely CsNFYA5, in transgenic tobacco plants. A total of 22 genes coding for NF-Y were identified in the genomes of sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and Clementine mandarin (C. clementina), including six CsNF-YAs, 11 CsNF-YBs and five CsNF-YCs. Phylogenetic analyses showed that there is a NF-Y orthologous in the Clementine genome for each sweet orange NF-Y gene; this was not observed when compared to Arabidopsis thaliana. CsNF-Y proteins shared the same conserved domains with their orthologous proteins in other organisms, including mouse. Analysis of gene expression by RNA-seq and EST data demonstrated that CsNF-Ys have a tissue-specific and stress inducible expression profile. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that CsNF-YA5 exhibits differential expression in response to water deficit in leaves and roots of citrus plants. Overexpression of CsNF-YA5 in transgenic tobacco plants contributed to the reduction of H2O2 production under dehydration conditions and increased plant growth and photosynthetic rate under normal conditions and drought stress. These biochemical and physiological responses to drought stress promoted by CsNF-YA5 may confer a productivity advantage in environments with frequent short-term soil water deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2808627338,"Recently, noncoding RNAs have been thought to play important roles in the sporadic occurrence of spinal deformity of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). As a prognostic factor for curve progression, low bone mass has been hypothesized to crosstalk with AIS pathogenesis. Abnormal osteoblasts activities are reported in AIS without a clear mechanism. In this study, bone biopsies from patients with AIS and control subjects and the primary osteoblasts derived from those samples were used to identify the potential microRNA (miRNA) candidates that interfere with osteoblasts and osteocytes function. Microarray analysis identified miRNA-145–5p (miR-145) as a potential upstream regulator. miR-145 and β-catenin mRNA (CTNNB1) were overexpressed in AIS bone tissues and primary osteoblasts, and their expression correlated positively in AIS. Knockdown of miR-145 restored impaired osteocyte activity through the down-regulation of active β-catenin expression and its transcriptional activity. Significant negative correlations between circulating miR-145 and serum sclerostin, osteopontin, and osteoprotegerin were noted in patients with AIS, which was in line with our cellular findings. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of aberrant miRNA expression and its effect on osteocyte function in AIS, which may contribute to the low bone mass.

https://openalex.org/W2808093411,"ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolase 3 (ARH3) plays important roles in regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, a reversible post-translational modification, and in maintenance of genomic integrity. ARH3 degrades poly(ADP-ribose) to protect cells from poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent cell death, reverses serine mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and hydrolyzes O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, a product of Sirtuin-catalyzed histone deacetylation. ARH3 preferentially hydrolyzes O-linkages attached to the anomeric C1″ of ADP-ribose; however, how ARH3 specifically recognizes and cleaves structurally diverse substrates remains unknown. Here, structures of full-length human ARH3 bound to ADP-ribose and Mg2+, coupled with computational modeling, reveal a dramatic conformational switch from closed to open states that enables specific substrate recognition. The glutamate flap, which blocks substrate entrance to Mg2+ in the unliganded closed state, is ejected from the active site when substrate is bound. This closed-to-open transition significantly widens the substrate-binding channel and precisely positions the scissile 1″-O-linkage for cleavage while securing tightly 2″- and 3″-hydroxyls of ADP-ribose. Our collective data uncover an unprecedented structural plasticity of ARH3 that supports its specificity for the 1″-O-linkage in substrates and Mg2+-dependent catalysis."

The costs and morbidity associated with skin cancer are increasing, and therefore identifying molecules that can help prevent skin carcinogenesis is important. In this study, we identified the p53-related protein kinase (PRPK) as a novel oncogenic protein that is phosphorylated by the T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK). Knockdown of TOPK inhibited PRPK phosphorylation and conferred resistance to solar-simulated light (SSL)-induced skin carcinogenesis in mouse models. In the clinic, acute SSL irradiation significantly increased epidermal thickness as well as total protein and phosphorylation levels of TOPK and PRPK in human skin tissues. We identified two PRPK inhibitors, FDA-approved rocuronium bromide (Zemuron®) or betamethasone 17-valerate (Betaderm®) that could attenuate TOPK-dependent PRPK signaling. Importantly, topical application of either rocuronium bromide or betamethasone decreased SSL-induced epidermal hyperplasia, neovascularization, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) development in SKH1 (Crl: SKH1-Hrhr) hairless mice by inhibiting PRPK activation, and also reduced expression of the proliferation and oncogenesis markers, COX-2, cyclin D1, and MMP-9. This study is the first to demonstrate that targeting PRPK could be useful against sUV-induced cSCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2808840706,"Humoral immunity involves multiple checkpoints that occur in B cell development, maturation, and activation. The pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR) is expressed following the productive recombination of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene, and sSignalsing through the pre-BCR are required for the differentiation of pre-B cells into immature B cells. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling the pre-BCR expression and signaling strength remain undefined. Herein, we probed the role of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated, stress-activated E3 ubiquitin ligase HMG-CoA reductase degradation 1 (Hrd1) in B cell differentiation. Using mice with a specific Hrd1 deletion in pro-B cells and subsequent B cell developmental stages, we showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 governs a critical checkpoint during B cell development. We observed that Hrd1 is required for degradation of the pre-BCR complex during the early stage of B cell development. As a consequence, loss of Hrd1 in the B cell lineage resulted in increased pre-BCR expression levels and a developmental defect in the transition from large to small pre-B cells. This defect, in turn, resulted in reduced fewer mature B cells in bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid organs. Our results revealed a novel critical role of Hrd1 in controlling a critical checkpoint in B cell-mediated immunity and suggest that Hrd1 may functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the pre-BCR complex."

To understand better the role of nonstructural protein 2B of the causative agent FMD virus (FMDV) in the process of virus replication, we identified a porcine host protein, cyclophilin A (CypA), which interacts with FMDV 2B. The 2B-CypA interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. CypA showed antiviral functions during FMDV infection. Overexpression of CypA decreased FMDV leader protein (Lpro) and 3A at protein levels. CypA-induced reduction of Lpro enhanced the synthesis of host proteins and increased the integrality of host eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF)-4γ (eIF4G). The reduction of Lpro and 3A was dependent on the proteasome pathway. No interaction was identified between CypA and Lpro or 3A. However, CypA-induced reduction of Lpro and 3A was suppressed by 2B, and disruption of 2B-CypA interaction impaired this inhibitive effect induced by 2B. In summary, our findings identify the antiviral role of CypA against FMDV and provide key insights into how FMDV antagonizes host antiviral response by 2B protein.—Liu, H., Xue, Q., Cao, W., Yang, F., Ma, L., Liu, W., Zhang, K., Liu, X., Zhu, Z., Zheng, H.

https://openalex.org/W2808456963,"Introduction Wheelchair users worldwide are at high risk of developing secondary health conditions and premature death due to inappropriate wheelchair provision by untrained providers. The International Society of Wheelchair Professionals (ISWP) has developed a Hybrid Course based on the World Health Organization’s Wheelchair Service Training Package—Basic Level. The Hybrid Course leverages online modules designed for low-bandwidth internet access that reduces the in-person training exposure from five to three and a half days, making it less expensive and more convenient for both trainees and trainers. Methods The Hybrid Course was designed using a systematic approach guided by an international group of stakeholders. The development followed the Quality Matters Higher Educational Rubric, web design guidelines for low bandwidth, experts’ opinions, and the best practices for blended course design. A quasi-experimental approach was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the Hybrid Course taken by six graduate students in Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh by measuring pre- and post knowledge using the validated ISWP Wheelchair Service Provision—Basic Test. The outcome measure was assessed using a paired sample t-test between pretest and posttest scores. The quality of the Hybrid Course was evaluated by three external reviewers using the Quality Matters Higher Educational Rubric who were blind to each others’ evaluation and the results of the training intervention. Results Hybrid Course participants reported significant increases in scores on the ISWP Wheelchair Service Provision—Basic Test after participating in the training, with an average increase of 10.84±5.42, p = 0.004, Cohen’s d = 1.99. In addition, the Hybrid Course met the Quality Matters Standards in two out of three evaluations and reported a percentage of agreement between evaluators of 84%. Conclusions The Hybrid Course met quality standards and proved to be effective in increasing basic level wheelchair knowledge in a group of Rehabilitation Science graduate students."

The chemerin knockout (KO) rat was created to test the hypothesis that removal of chemerin would reduce pressure in the normal and hypertensive state. Western analyses confirmed loss of chemerin in the plasma and tissues of the KO vs. wild-type (WT) rats. Chemerin concentration in plasma and tissues was lower in WT females than in WT males, as determined by Western analysis. Conscious male and female KO rats had modest differences in baseline measures vs. the WT that included systolic, diastolic, mean arterial and pulse pressures, and heart rate, all measured telemetrically. The mineralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and salt water, combined with uninephrectomy as a hypertensive stimulus, elevated mean and systolic blood pressures of the male KO higher than the male WT. By contrast, all pressures in the female KO were lower than their WT throughout DOCA-salt treatment.

The structural analysis was complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to characterize solvent accessibility and product release mechanisms. We identified non-obvious residues located on the loops on the border between the active site and the secondary binding pocket essential for pig and human DAAO substrate specificity and activity. We engineered DAAOs by mutating such critical residues and characterised the biochemical activity of the resulting variants.

https://openalex.org/W2807783331,"We demonstrated previously that the splicing of the actin regulator, hMENA, generates two alternatively expressed isoforms, hMENA11a and hMENAΔv6, which have opposite functions in cell invasiveness. Their mechanisms of action have remained unclear. Here we report two major findings: (i) hMENA regulates β1 integrin expression. This was shown by depleting total hMENA, which led to loss of nuclear expression of serum response factor (SRF)-coactivator myocardin-related transcription factor 1 (MRTF-A), leading to an increase in the G-actin/F-actin ratio crucial for MRTF-A localization. This in turn inhibited SRF activity and the expression of its target gene β1 integrin. (ii) hMENA11a reduces and hMENAΔv6 increases β1 integrin activation and signaling. Moreover, exogenous expression of hMENA11a in hMENAΔv6-positive cancer cells dramatically reduces secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including β1 integrin ligands and metalloproteinases. On the other hand, overexpression of the pro-invasive hMENAΔv6 increases fibronectin production. In primary tumors high hMENA11a correlates with low stromal fibronectin and a favorable clinical outcome of early node-negative non-small-cell lung cancer patients. These data provide new insights into the roles of hMENA11a and hMENAΔv6 in the druggable β1 integrin-ECM signaling axis and allow stratification of patient risk, guiding their clinical management."
https://openalex.org/W2808377936,"Synonymous nucleotide variation is increasingly recognized as a factor than can affect protein expression, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether synonymous changes could affect expression of the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily H member 2 (KCNH2) gene, encoding the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) ion channel, which is linked to hereditary cardiac arrhythmia. We examined a previously described synthetic version (hERG-codon modified (CM)) with synonymous substitutions designed to reduce GC content, rare codons, and mRNA secondary structure relative to the native construct (hERG-NT). hERG-CM exhibited lower protein expression than hERG-NT in HEK293T cells. We found that the steady-state abundance of hERG-NT mRNA was greater than hERG-CM because of an enhanced transcription rate and increased mRNA stability for hERG-NT. Translation of hERG-CM was independently reduced, contributing to the overall greater synthesis of hERG-NT channel protein. This was partially offset, however, by a higher aggregation of a newly synthesized hERG-NT channel, resulting in nonfunctional protein. Regional mRNA analyses of chimeras of hERG-NT and hERG-CM revealed that synonymous changes in the 5' segments of the coding region had the greatest influence on hERG synthesis at both the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these results indicate that synonymous nucleotide variations within the coding region, particularly in the 5' region of the hERG mRNA, can affect both transcription and translation. These findings support the notion that greater attention should be given to the effects of synonymous genetic variation when analyzing hERG DNA sequences in the study of hereditary cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2807760870,"The challenges associated with sampling rare species or populations can limit our ability to make accurate and informed estimates of biodiversity for clades or ecosystems. This may be particularly true for tropical trees, which tend to be poorly sampled, and are thought to harbor extensive cryptic diversity. Here, we integrate genomics, morphology, and geography to estimate the number of species in a clade of dioecious tropical trees (Canarium L.; Burseraceae) endemic to Madagascar, for which previous taxonomic treatments have recognized between one and 33 species. By sampling genomic data from even a limited number of individuals per taxon, we were able to clearly reject both previous hypotheses, and support instead an intermediate number of taxa. We recognize at least six distinct clades based on genetic structure and species delimitation analyses that correspond clearly with geographic and discrete morphological differences. Two widespread clades co-occur broadly throughout eastern wet forests, one clade is endemic to western dry forests, and several slightly admixed clades are more narrowly distributed in mountainous regions in the north. Multiple previously described taxa were recovered as paraphyletic in our analyses, some of which were associated with admixed individuals, suggesting that hybridization contributes to taxonomic difficulties in Canarium. An improved understanding of Canarium species diversity has important implications for conservation efforts and understanding the origins of diversity in Madagascar. Our study shows that even limited genomic sampling, when combined with geography and morphology, can greatly improve estimates of species diversity for difficult tropical clades."

Results of our clinical trial showed that the TEVG possesses growth capacity but that its widespread clinical use is not yet advisable due to the high incidence of TEVG stenosis. In animal models, TEVG stenosis is caused by increased monocytic cell recruitment and its classic (“M1”) activation. Here, we report on the source and regulation of these monocytes. TEVGs were implanted in wild-type, CCR2 knockout (Ccr2−/−), splenectomized, and spleen graft recipient mice. We found that bone marrow—derived Ly6C+hi monocytes released from sequestration by the spleen are the source of mononuclear cells infiltrating the TEVG during the acute phase of neovessel formation. Furthermore, short-term administration of losartan (0.6 g/L, 2 wk), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the macrophage populations (Ly6C+/−/F480+) in the scaffolds and improved long-term patency in TEVGs. Notably, the combined effect of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell seeding with short-term losartan treatment completely prevented the development of TEVG stenosis.

The pioneering study presumed that the animal communities are primary sustained by reducing fluid originated from the serpentinization of mantle peridotite. For understanding the nutrient and energy sources for the SSF community, this study conducted four expeditions to the SSF and collected additional animal samples such as polychaetes and crustaceans as well as sediments, fragments of chimneys developing on fissures of serpentinized peridotite, seeping fluid on the chimneys, and pore water within the chimneys. Geochemical analyses of seeping fluids on the chimneys and pore water of the chimneys revealed significantly high pH (~10) that suggest subseafloor serpentinization controlling fluid chemistry. Stable isotope systematics (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) among animals, inorganic molecules, and environmental organic matter suggest that the SSF animal community mostly relies on the chemosynthetic production while some organisms appear to partly benefit from photosynthetic production despite the great depth of SSF."

In order to improve treatment outcome, it is critical to address those lost to follow-up (LTFU). The objective of the study therefore was to describe the characteristics of, and analyze the risk factors for those LTFU among pulmonary TB patients aged between 15 and 64, and discuss policy implications. Methods The study used a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative approach, and was conducted in two phases. The first involved analysis of cohort data from the national TB surveillance of PTB patients newly notified between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2015. The second phase involved focus group (FGD) discussions with public health nurses, who are responsible for supporting TB patients’ adherence to medication, on the possible reasons why some patients become lost to follow-up. Results Analysis of the surveillance data suggested that among all patients, positive sputum smear (adjusted odds ratio, [aOR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47–0.58) and cavitary lesion on chest x-ray (aOR 0.79, 95%CI 0.72–0.85) decreased the risk, while not requiring hospitalization increased the risk of LTFU (aOR 1.46, 95%CI 1.33–1.60). Among females, being a physician (aOR 2.07 95%CI 1.23–3.48) and nurse (aOR 1.18, 95%CI 1.91–1.37) were identified as additional risk factors for LTFU. The analysis of focus group discussions revealed three possible themes which may be useful in understanding why nurses and physicians were at a higher risk of becoming LTFU–firstly, the possibility that physicians and nurses were finding it difficult to make medication taking a routine, secondly, their low risk perception towards TB is affecting their adherence behavior, and thirdly, their unwillingness to accept DOTS was increasing their risk of becoming LTFU. Conclusions The analysis of surveillance data and FGD transcripts indicated that patient education for those starting their treatment as an outpatient, and establishing DOTS that is both acceptable and realistic to physicians and nurses, may be two issues which need to be addressed urgently."

In the first step of GPI biosynthesis, a phosphatidylinositol (PI) receives an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) from UDP–GlcNAc. The GlcNAc–PI thus generated is then deacetylated at the sugar, triply mannosylated, and decorated with 2–3 phosphoethanolamine groups at the different mannoses. The phosphoethanolamine on the third mannose is crucial for the final step that involves attachment of the anchor to a newly translocated protein in the ER lumen to generate a complete GPI-anchored protein.

The GPI-anchored protein is then transported via the secretory pathway to the extracellular surface of the cell membranes and/or the cell walls where they function (7.Castillon G.A.

Despite a rather conserved core, GPI biosynthesis shows species-specific differences both in terms of sequences of the reactions involved as well as substrate specificities (3.Pittet M. Conzelmann A.

Recently, it has also begun to be recognized that significant variations exist, particularly among accessory subunits of the various enzymes involved in this pathway. One possible hypothesis that would justify these variations is that these subunits determine how and in what context the GPI biosynthetic pathway would be regulated in the organism. The first hint of such differences came up when studies on the mammalian GPI–GnT enzyme showed the presence of Dpm2, a subunit of the dolichol–phosphate–mannose synthase, as an activator (8.Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. DPM2 regulates biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate-mannose in mammalian cells: correct subcellular localization and stabilization of DPM1, and binding of dolichol phosphate.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (9724629): 4920-492910.1093/emboj/17.17.4920Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9.Watanabe R.

No Dpm2 homolog is known to exist in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or C. albicans. Likewise, studies on the GPI–GnT enzyme complex of S. cerevisiae indicated a negative mutual regulation between the first step of GPI biosynthesis catalyzed by GPI–GnT and Ras signaling, whereas studies in mammalian cells did not indicate a similar interaction (10.Sobering A.K.

Our own investigations revealed that in C. albicans, a close relative of S. cerevisiae, both Ras signaling and ergosterol biosynthesis cross-talk with the GPI–GnT complex (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S.

However, there were significant differences between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans in how they interact with Ras signaling. In the former, down-regulation of many of the GPI–GnT subunits resulted in hyperfilamentous phenotypes, suggesting that hyperactive Ras is a common response to defects in the first enzyme complex (Fig. 1, left panel) (10.Sobering A.K. Romeo M.J. Vay H.A. Levin D.E. A novel Ras inhibitor, Eri1, engages yeast Ras at the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Cell.

In C. albicans, however, down-regulating a subunit encoded by CaGPI19 caused hyperfilamentation and Ras hyperactivation, whereas down-regulation of a different subunit encoded by CaGPI2 resulted in the exact opposite phenotypes due to reduced Ras signaling (Fig. 1, right panel) (13.Yadav B.

In other words, the outcome was dictated by the identity of the subunit of the GPI–GnT complex that was down-regulated. Thus, a simple correlation between GPI–GnT activity and Ras signaling could not be drawn. More detailed analysis using double deletion mutants permitted us to conclude that CaGPI19 and CaGPI2 were mutually negatively regulated (Fig. 1, right panel), and disrupting one allele of CaGPI2 in a Cagpi19 heterozygous mutant could control the filamentation pattern in it (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S. Ahmad M.F. Jain P. Pratyusha V.A. Kumar P. Komath S.S. First step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis cross-talks with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling in Candida albicans.J. Biol.

Thus, when it came to Ras signaling and filamentation, CaGPI2 acted downstream of CaGPI19 (Fig. 1, right panel). However, what happens at the level of the proteins? How does CaGpi2 interact with Ras signaling? Does its interaction require the formation of a functional GPI–GnT complex as was seen in S. cerevisiae? How do other subunits of the GPI–GnT interact with Ras signaling? Can they interact with CaRas proteins independently or do they all act via a single subunit? Is Ras an inhibitor of GPI–GnT in C. albicans as is reported in S. cerevisiae? Does the subcellular localization of Ras and its activation status matter? Is there a physical interaction between CaGpi2 and any of the two C. albicans Ras proteins and, if so, in which compartment does it occur? These are some of the questions we explore in this work. We show that all the GPI–GnT subunits interact with Ras signaling via CaGpi2. Of the two C. albicans Ras proteins, CaRas1 is the only one that participates in this interaction. The activation of Ras signaling by CaGpi2 does not depend on the formation of a functional GPI–GnT complex. Overexpression of CaGpi2, however, alters the status of Hsp90 in the cell. CaRas1 enhances the GPI–GnT activity of the enzyme complex, and the activation is favored by its GTP-bound active state. A direct physical interaction exists between CaGpi2 and CaRas1 and the extent of this interaction is determined by the localization of CaRas1 in the ER. The GPI–GnT enzyme in C. albicans is made up of six putative subunits, based on sequence homology with S. cerevisiae. Of these, CaGpi3 is the putative catalytic subunit, and CaGpi1, CaGpi2, CaGpi15, CaGpi19, and CaEri1 are expected to be accessory subunits. Mutants of each of these subunits were generated as described under “Experimental procedures” and studied as described below. The generation of CaGPI2 and CaGPI19 heterozygous and conditional null mutants in the BWP17 strain of C. albicans was described previously (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S. Ahmad M.F. Jain P. Pratyusha V.A. Kumar P. Komath S.S. First step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis cross-talks with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling in Candida albicans.J. Biol.

Because C. albicans has two alleles of each gene, the heterozygous mutants of the GPI–GnT genes were constructed by disruption of one allele of a specific gene by one of the two selection markers, HIS1 or ARG4. Repeated attempts to make homozygous nulls were unsuccessful in all cases. Hence, conditional null mutants were generated by replacing the endogenous promoter of the surviving allele with a repressible MET3 promoter in the heterozygous strain background. The successful generation of the heterozygous and conditional null deletion mutants was first confirmed by PCR and then by monitoring the relative transcript levels of the corresponding GPI–GnT subunit gene vis à vis the WT control using real time-PCR (RT-PCR). The transcript levels of CaGPI1, CaGPI2, CaGPI3, CaGPI15, CaGPI19, and CaERI1 were significantly down-regulated in their respective deletion mutants (Fig. S1). This confirmation allowed us to use these mutants for further studies. The percentage of GPI–GnT activity was measured in the GPI–GnT deletion mutants with respect to that of the WT strain, BWP17. Significantly lower GPI–GnT activity was observed in the heterozygous mutants CaGPI2/Cagpi2 (CaGPI2Hz), CaGPI15/Cagpi15 (CaGPI15Hz), CaGPI19/Cagpi19 (CaGPI19Hz), and CaERI1/Caeri1 (CaERI1Hz) mutant strains as compared with BWP17, suggesting that they were required for GPI–GnT activity (Fig. 2A). The heterozygous mutants CaGPI1/Cagpi1 (CaGPI1Hz) and CaGPI3/Cagpi3 (CaGPI3Hz) had ∼80%, or greater, relative GPI–GnT activity suggesting haplosufficiency of these genes when it came to maintaining GPI–GnT activity at near normal levels. Hence, the conditional null mutants were examined. Both Cagpi1 and Cagpi3 conditional null mutants were grown in repressive growth media, and GPI–GnT activity was estimated in these mutants relative to WT control strain (Fig. 2B). The Cagpi1 conditional null mutant (∼20%) and the Cagpi3 conditional null mutant (∼40%) had drastically reduced GPI–GnT activity as compared with the control strain under repressive growth conditions. Thus, CaGpi1 and CaGpi3 are also essential for GPI–GnT activity in C. albicans. As mentioned earlier, Cagpi2 is hypofilamentous due to decreased Ras signaling, and Cagpi19 is hyperfilamentous due to enhanced Ras signaling as compared with the WT strain (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S. Ahmad M.F. Jain P. Pratyusha V.A. Kumar P. Komath S.S. First step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis cross-talks with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling in Candida albicans.J.

Hyphal morphogenesis of the four remaining GPI–GnT subunit mutants of C. albicans were examined in Spider medium as well as YEPD at 37 °C. Down-regulation of CaGPI1, CaGPI3, and CaGPI15 led to decreased hyphal growth with respect to BWP17 under hypha-inducing conditions, whereas down-regulation of CaERI1 resulted in hyperfilamentation (Fig. 3A). The phenotypes of CaGPI2Hz and CaGPI19Hz are also shown for comparison (Fig. 3A). The revertant strains were restored in their hyphal morphogenesis phenotypes, indicating that the effect was specifically caused by the gene defect in each case (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained for hyphal growth of the strains in liquid Spider medium as well (Fig. 3, C and D). As seen previously in the CaGPI2Hz and CaGPI19Hz mutant strains (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S. Ahmad M.F. Jain P. Pratyusha V.A. Kumar P. Komath S.S. First step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis cross-talks with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (24356967): 3365-338210.1074/jbc.M113.528802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), are the hyphal morphologies of the other GPI–GnT mutants also correlated with the levels of CaGPI2 in them? To test this hypothesis, we first examined mRNA transcript as well as protein expression levels of CaGPI2 in the various GPI–GnT deletion mutants (Fig. 4A, panels i and ii, and Fig. S2). The transcript and protein expression levels of CaGPI2 were down-regulated in the hypofilamentous strains, CaGPI1Hz, CaGPI2Hz, CaGPI3Hz, and CaGPI15Hz as compared with the control. In contrast, CaGPI2 was up-regulated in the hyperfilamentous CaGPI19Hz and CaERI1Hz strains. Thus, hyphal growth in the GPI–GnT mutants correlates with CaGPI2 expression levels. Next, we overexpressed CaGPI2 in the hypofilamentous CaGPI1Hz, CaGPI3Hz, and CaGPI15Hz strains. In each case, hyphal growth was restored back to WT levels as was the Ras-dependent cAMP/PKA signaling (Fig. 4B, panels i and ii, and Fig. S3, panel i). Disrupting one allele of CaGPI2 in the CaGPI19Hz or CaERI1Hz strain, however, reversed their hyperfilamentation phenotype and reduced cAMP/PKA signaling (Fig. 4C, panels i and ii, and Fig. S3, panel ii). The converse was not true. Disruption of one allele of CaERI1 in the CaGPI2Hz strain did not induce greater filamentation in it (Fig. 4D, panel i). We have previously shown that disruption of one allele of CaGPI19 in the CaGPI2Hz strain also does not induce hyperfilamentation (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S. Ahmad M.F. Jain P. Pratyusha V.A. Kumar P. Komath S.S. First step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis cross-talks with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling in Candida albicans.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289 (24356967): 3365-338210.1074/jbc.M113.528802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of CaGPI1, CaGPI3, and CaGPI15 in the CaGPI2Hz strain also did not restore hyphal morphogenesis (Fig. 4D, panel ii). Taken together, it may therefore be inferred that CaGpi2 is downstream of all GPI–GnT subunits in regulation of Ras signaling. GPI–GnT activity is restored in the revertant strain expressing CaGPI2 as compared with the CaGPI2Hz strain (Fig. 5A). However, in all the other hypofilamentous GPI–GnT mutant strains, GPI–GnT activity decreases upon overexpressing CaGPI2 (Fig. 5A). Likewise, disruption of CaGPI2 in the hyperfilamentous GPI–GnT mutant strains does not result in restoration of GPI–GnT activity (Fig. 5B), even though it reverses the hyperfilamentation phenotype. A transcript level analysis in the WT strain overexpressing CaGPI2 suggests that the levels of the different GPI–GnT subunits are significantly altered (Fig. 5C, panel i). Although the levels of CaGPI1, CaGPI3, and CaGPI15 are up-regulated upon overexpression of CaGPI2, the levels of CaGPI19 and CaERI1 are down-regulated, thereby hampering formation of a functional enzyme complex. Likewise, the expression levels of all the GPI–GnT genes are up-regulated in the CaGPI2Hz strain, whereas that of CaGPI2 is reduced (Fig. 5C, panel ii). Thus, it appears that a certain optimal stoichiometry of the subunits is required for constitution of an active GPI–GnT enzyme complex. C. albicans has two Ras proteins. Because both RAS1 and RAS2 are nonessential genes in C. albicans, a complete null mutant, made by deleting both copies of CaRAS1 and CaRAS2, was used for this study (17.Zhu Y. Fang H.-M. Wang Y.-M. Zeng G.-S. Zheng X.-D. Wang Y. Ras1 and Ras2 play antagonistic roles in regulating cellular cAMP level, stationary-phase entry and stress response in Candida albicans.Mol.

Caras1/Caras2 had lower GPI–GnT activity (∼50%) as compared with WT BWP17 (Fig. 6A), suggesting that deletion of CaRAS genes causes a reduction in GPI–GnT activity. This is in complete contrast to that reported in S. cerevisiae where deletion of RAS2 (homologous to CaRAS1) leads a to significant increase in GPI–GnT activity (11.Sobering A.K. Watanabe R. Romeo M.J. Yan B.C. Specht C.A. Orlean P. Riezman H. Levin D.E. Yeast Ras regulates the complex that catalyzes the first step in GPI-anchor biosynthesis at the ER.Cell. 2004; 117 (15163411): 637-64810.1016/j.cell.2004.05.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CaRAS1 and CaRAS2 were now separately reintroduced as single copies in the Caras1/Caras2 mutant to generate strains that express only one Ras protein at a time. A strong ACT1 promoter was used to ensure sufficient CaRas1 and CaRas2 levels, given that both alleles of CaRAS1 and CaRAS2 were deleted in the Caras1/Caras2 mutant. The expression of the CaRas proteins was confirmed by transcript level analysis (Fig. S4A), and their filamentation phenotypes (Fig. S4B) were in complete agreement with what has been reported previously (17.Zhu Y. Fang H.-M. Wang Y.-M. Zeng G.-S. Zheng X.-D. Wang Y. Ras1 and Ras2 play antagonistic roles in regulating cellular cAMP level, stationary-phase entry and stress response in Candida albicans.Mol.

GPI–GnT activity was assayed in Caras1/Caras2/CaRAS1 and Caras1/Caras2/CaRAS2, compared with Caras1/Caras2/URA3 (Fig. 6A). Restoration in GPI–GnT activity was observed in the former but not in the latter strain. Thus, CaRAS1 alone exerts control on the first step of the GPI anchor biosynthetic pathway. It has been previously shown that in the CaGPI2Hz strain overexpression of CaRas1, but not CaRas2, restores hyphal morphogenesis (13.Yadav B. Bhatnagar S. Ahmad M.F. Jain P. Pratyusha V.A. Kumar P. Komath S.S. First step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis cross-talks with ergosterol biosynthesis and Ras signaling in Candida albicans.J. Biol.

Thus, CaRas1 exerts control over GPI–GnT as well as hyphal morphogenesis in C. albicans. CaRas1 cycles between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. To ascertain whether stimulation of GPI–GnT activity requires the GTP-bound active form of CaRas1, we introduced a G13V mutation in CaRas1. CaRas1G13Vis constitutively activated and cannot interact with the GTPase-activating protein (GAP), Ira2, to return back to its inactive GDP-bound state (18.Feng Q. Summers E. Guo B. Fink G.

https://openalex.org/W2808083512,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of elevated temperature on bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOECs), based on the expression and localization of both heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), responsible for the cellular defence mechanism, and oviduct specific glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) which is the most important embryotrophic protein. BOECs were cultured alone and co-cultured with cattle embryos at control (38.5°C) and elevated temperature (41°C) for 168 h. The elevated temperature had no effect on the viability of BOECs but exerted a negative effect on embryo development. The elevated temperature increased the expression of HSP70 and decreased the expression of OVGP1 at both mRNA and protein levels in BOECs cultured alone and those co-cultured with embryos. However, the presence of embryos limited the decrease in OVGP1 expression in BOECs at elevated temperature but did not alter the expression of HSP70. These results demonstrate for the first time the influence of elevated temperature on BOECs, consequently providing insights into the interactions between the embryo and the oviduct at elevated temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2808449835,"PspA is a key component of the bacterial Psp membrane-stress response system. The biochemical and functional characterization of PspA is impeded by its oligomerization and aggregation properties. It was recently possible to solve the coiled coil structure of a completely soluble PspA fragment, PspA(1–144), that associates with the σ54 enhancer binding protein PspF at its W56-loop and thereby down-regulates the Psp response. We now found that the C-terminal part of PspA, PspA(145–222), also interacts with PspF and inhibits its activity in the absence of full-length PspA. Surprisingly, PspA(145–222) effects changed completely in the presence of full-length PspA, as promoter activity was triggered instead of being inhibited under this condition. PspA(145–222) thus interfered with the inhibitory effect of full-length PspA on PspF, most likely by interacting with full-length PspA that remained bound to PspF. In support of this view, a comprehensive bacterial-2-hybrid screen as well as co-purification analyses indicated a self-interaction of PspA(145–222) and an interaction with full-length PspA. This is the first direct demonstration of PspA/PspA and PspA/PspF interactions in vivo that are mediated by the C-terminus of PspA. The data indicate that regulatory binding sites on PspF do not only exist for the N-terminal coiled coil domain but also for the C-terminal domain of PspA. The inhibition of PspF by PspA-(145–222) was reduced upon membrane stress, whereas the inhibition of PspF by PspA(1–144) did not respond to membrane stress. We therefore propose that the C-terminal domain of PspA is crucial for the regulation of PspF in response to Psp system stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2808387228,"Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows slight spatial variations in brain white matter (WM). We used quantitative multi-parametric MRI to evaluate in what respect these inhomogeneities could correspond to WM subtypes with specific characteristics and spatial distribution. Materials and methods Twenty-six controls (12 women, 38 ±9 Y) took part in a 60-min session on a 3T scanner measuring 7 parameters: R1 and R2, diffusion tensor imaging which allowed to measure Axial and Radial Diffusivity (AD, RD), magnetization transfer imaging which enabled to compute the Macromolecular Proton Fraction (MPF), and a susceptibility-weighted sequence which permitted to quantify R2* and magnetic susceptibility (χm). Spatial independent component analysis was used to identify WM subtypes with specific combination of quantitative parameters values. Results Three subtypes could be identified. t-WM (track) mostly mapped on well-formed projection and commissural tracts and came with high AD values (all p < 10−18). The two other subtypes were located in subcortical WM and overlapped with association fibers: f-WM (frontal) was mostly anterior in the frontal lobe whereas c-WM (central) was underneath the central cortex. f-WM and c-WM had higher MPF values, indicating a higher myelin content (all p < 1.7 10−6). This was compatible with their larger χm and R2, as iron is essentially stored in oligodendrocytes (all p < 0.01). Although R1 essentially showed the same, its higher value in t-WM relative to c-WM might be related to its higher cholesterol concentration. Conclusions Thus, f- and c-WMs were less structured, but more myelinated and probably more metabolically active regarding to their iron content than WM related to fasciculi (t-WM). As known WM bundles passed though different WM subtypes, myelination might not be uniform along the axons but rather follow a spatially consistent regional variability. Future studies might examine the reproducibility of this decomposition and how development and pathology differently affect each subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2808625790,"Whether to boost the immune system or to tame it, drugs that modulate immune function are becoming an essential part of modern pharmacopoeia. While many of these target molecules that are expressed by immune cells, recent advances in immunometabolism are now opening new classes of modulators that derive from endogenous metabolites. It is becoming clear that the immune system is involved in many diseases, including conditions that were not traditionally considered infectious, inflammatory, or autoimmune, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In that context, immunomodulation is now a critical part of the pharmaceutic arsenal, either for the potentiation of immune responses, with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 as obvious examples, or to limit them, with anti-tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) leading drug sales for the last few years. By and large, research in this area has been focused on blocking immune cytokines and receptors either through antibodies or kinase inhibitors. Now, with two recent studies reporting the use of modified metabolites to suppress immune responses (Kornberg et al., 2018Kornberg M.D. Bhargava P. Kim P.M. Putluri V. Snowman A.M. Putluri N. Calabresi P.A. Snyder S.H. Dimethyl fumarate targets GAPDH and aerobic glycolysis to modulate immunity.Science. 2018; 360: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, Mills et al., 2018Mills E.L. Ryan D.G. Prag H.A. Dikovskaya D. Menon D. Zaslona Z. Jedrychowski M.P. Costa A.S.H. Higgins M. Hams E. et al.Itaconate is an anti-inflammatory metabolite that activates Nrf2 via alkylation of KEAP1.Nature. 2018; 556: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), immunometabolism is opening a new front in the quest to modulate immune function. Indeed, the current approaches have shown extraordinary success, but they have also sometimes been limited by the redundancy of immune activators and inhibitors. For example, immune exhaustion in cancer is mediated by a large variety of soluble and cell-surface molecules, and despite the success of anti-PD-1 as a single agent, many other receptors might need to be blocked simultaneously to improve therapeutic efficiency further and overcome resistance (Sharma et al., 2017Sharma P. Hu-Lieskovan S. Wargo J.A. Ribas A. Primary, Adaptive, and Acquired Resistance to Cancer Immunotherapy.Cell. 2017; 168: 707-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2485) Google Scholar). In addition to immune mediators, the function of immune cells is also modulated by all core pathways for cellular function, and metabolism has emerged as a critical hub in their activation. This line of inquiry started with the observation that activated T cells rely on aerobic glycolysis to support their proliferation early in a response (Frauwirth et al., 2002Frauwirth K.A. Riley J.L. Harris M.H. Parry R.V. Rathmell J.C. Plas D.R. Elstrom R.L. June C.H. Thompson C.B. The CD28 signaling pathway regulates glucose metabolism.Immunity. 2002; 16: 769-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), a phenomenon also observed in cancer cells as the Warburg effect. Beyond proliferation, metabolic shifts have been linked to immune differentiation, for example, in macrophages, where in broad strokes, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation are induced and necessary for distinct types of responses (Van den Bossche et al., 2017Van den Bossche J. O’Neill L.A. Menon D. Macrophage Immunometabolism: Where Are We (Going)?.Trends Immunol. 2017; 38: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). These pathways are critical to provide immune cells with building blocks for proliferation and the production and secretion of effector proteins. Perhaps more surprisingly, the metabolic intermediates of these pathways also appear to play critical roles in shaping the cell’s phenotype: succinate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, can promote inflammation both in a cell-intrinsic manner and as a soluble signal (Mills and O’Neill, 2014Mills E. O’Neill L.A.J. Succinate: a metabolic signal in inflammation.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 313-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), while itaconate, a derivative of aconitate produced in the mitochondria, has both anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects (Luan and Medzhitov, 2016Luan H.H. Medzhitov R. Food Fight: Role of Itaconate and Other Metabolites in Antimicrobial Defense.Cell Metab. 2016; 24: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) As mentioned above, two recent studies are now bridging these basic insights with viable approaches for immunomodulation. First, Snyder and colleagues investigate the mechanism of action of dimethylfumarate (DMF), a derivative of the metabolite fumarate that is currently used as an immunomodulator in psoriasis and multiple sclerosis (Kornberg et al., 2018Kornberg M.D. Bhargava P. Kim P.M. Putluri V. Snowman A.M. Putluri N. Calabresi P.A. Snyder S.H. Dimethyl fumarate targets GAPDH and aerobic glycolysis to modulate immunity.Science. 2018; 360: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). They find that DMF inhibits the enzymatic activity of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and has become a staple as a loading and housekeeping control), thereby limiting aerobic glycolysis and inflammation. While this effect may represent a natural feedback loop mediated by fumarate, the modified metabolite appeared to mediate this effect more efficiently because it is more cell permeable and electrophilic. Importantly, this study also demonstrates that targeting of specific metabolic enzymes; here, GAPDH is a viable immunomodulatory strategy. Working with a distinct metabolite, Murphy, O’Neill and colleagues report that 4-octyl itaconate, a cell-permeable derivative of itaconate, is protective in a model of LPS lethality (Mills et al., 2018Mills E.L. Ryan D.G. Prag H.A. Dikovskaya D. Menon D. Zaslona Z. Jedrychowski M.P. Costa A.S.H. Higgins M. Hams E. et al.Itaconate is an anti-inflammatory metabolite that activates Nrf2 via alkylation of KEAP1.Nature. 2018; 556: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In this case, the effect is mediated by the alkylation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), as this modification promotes the stabilization of Nrf2 (also known as NFE2L2, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2), that promotes anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory responses and, in this context, downregulates IL-1β production. Altogether, these two studies demonstrate that the basic insights accumulated on the role of metabolites in immunomodulation are now opening new therapeutic avenues. The chemical modification of these metabolites and others, to influence either their localization, availability, or ability to modify proteins, is likely to provide a wealth of compounds with immunomodulatory effects. One important caveat of these approaches, however, is that these central metabolic pathways are involved in all cell types and not merely immune cells and could thus have broader side effects, as has been observed to some extent with DMF. More broadly, these studies also represent a first step toward immunomodulatory strategies that target the metabolism of immune cells, and while both focus on limiting immune responses, these approaches could also be critical to augment immune function in cancer, where metabolic competition is often thought to limit T cell responses (Chang et al., 2015Chang C.-H. Qiu J. O’Sullivan D. Buck M.D. Noguchi T. Curtis J.D. Chen Q. Gindin M.

However, the global pattern of repolarization is difficult to assess clinically. Activation recovery interval (ARI) has been used to understand the properties of ventricular repolarization. In this study, we developed an ARI imaging technique to noninvasively reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) ARI maps in 10 premature ventricular contraction (PVC) patients and evaluated the results with the endocardial ARI maps recorded by a clinical navigation system (CARTO). From the analysis results of a total of 100 PVC beats in 10 patients, the average correlation coefficient is 0.86±0.05 and the average relative error is 0.06±0.03. The average localization error is 4.5±2.3 mm between the longest ARI sites in 3D ARI maps and those in CARTO endocardial ARI maps. The present results suggest that ARI imaging could serve as an alternative of evaluating global pattern of ventricular repolarization noninvasively and could assist in the future investigation of the relationship between global repolarization dispersion and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2807719649,"I landed my dream job: a tenure-track position at a primarily undergraduate institution near my hometown where I would develop a new neuroscience major. I entered that position the way one enters a marriage: expecting it to last forever, assuming I would give it everything I had, hoping that—while it would not always be easy—it would be worth it. Soon, though, something seemed amiss. It felt kind of like sexism—but not exactly. Whatever it was, I experienced it from both women and men, from the department chair to the administrative assistant. It was only after many years and a career upheaval that I learned there was a legal term to describe it.

![Figure][1] 

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

Relatively early on, an administrator asked me to meet with every member of the department to tell them about my teaching schedule. It was odd. None of us knew anyone else's schedules, and mine wasn't particularly unusual, just Monday-Wednesday-Friday. Was this just a normal part of being a junior faculty member? If it was, then why didn't I know the schedule of a colleague who started with me? I had just returned from maternity leave.

One morning, my 2-year-old son had a serious fall and I needed to take him to the emergency room. When I got to campus the next day, a colleague stopped by. He told me that, at lunch, he had heard about what happened and had said to everyone there, “Hey, if I had a dollar for every time I fell on my head, I'd be a millionaire.” Maybe he thought it was funny. I saw it as suggesting that I had foolishly overreacted and shouldn't have let my son's injury take me away from my academic work. I had seen colleagues go out of their way to cover one another's classes when they needed to take a pet to the vet, go to the dentist, or attend their Friday jazz practice. Why was the reaction to me so different?

Later, when the department chair position opened up, I was not invited to apply. I had created and directed one of the most popular science majors on campus and had been unanimously granted tenure. I was also pregnant with my third child at the time.

The sustained effort necessary to succeed in the face of this behavior consumed inordinate energy. I learned to seek out colleagues from other departments and look into administrative guidelines when something didn't feel right. I spent a lot of time trying to anticipate where the next challenge would come from. As I gathered my materials to apply for promotion to full professor, I thought, “I cannot do this anymore.” I handed in my resignation. Initially my provost did not accept it. However, another administrator said, “It's time. It's time to be home with your children,” and then circulated an email to that effect. I felt like my career had been derailed, and I didn't understand exactly why, except that—as this last comment made clear—it was related to the fact that I'm a mother.

When I regained the mental space to reflect on what happened, and after much research, I finally came upon the term “maternal wall bias,” now broadened to “family responsibilities discrimination.” I learned that some of what I experienced reflected attribution bias, when everyday actions—taking a child to the doctor, choosing one teaching schedule over another—are interpreted through negative stereotypes of parents, and particularly mothers, as scientists. I learned about leniency bias, when the same work standard is applied more strictly to parents. And I learned that the more children one has, the more severe the bias. It was both validating and maddening to confirm why I had been so marginalized.

I cannot change what happened to me. But I can share what I learned so that both nonparents and parents will be aware that this kind of discrimination is not only unacceptable—it's illegal. After all, this is our responsibility as scientists: When we learn something that may fundamentally impact the future of our fields, we share it.

https://openalex.org/W2808202070,"Trigger factor (TF) is a key component of the prokaryotic chaperone network, which is involved in many basic cellular processes, such as protein folding, protein trafficking, and ribosome assembly. The major chaperone site of TF has a cradle-like structure in which protein substrate may fold without interference from other proteins. Here, we investigated in vivo and in vitro the roles of hydrophobic and charged patches on the edge and interior of cradle during TF-assisted protein folding. Our results showed that most of the surface of the cradle was involved in TF-assisted protein folding, which was larger than found in early studies. Although the inner surface of cradle was mostly hydrophobic, both hydrophobic and electrostatic patches were indispensable for TF to facilitate correct protein folding. However, hydrophobic patches were more important for the antiaggregation activity of TF. Furthermore, it was found that the patches on the surface of cradle were involved in TF-assisted protein folding in a spatial and temporal order. These results suggest that the folding-favorable interface between the cradle and substrate was dynamic during TF-assisted protein folding, which enabled TF to be involved in the folding of substrate in an aggressive manner rather than acting as a classic holdase.—Fan, D., Cao, S., Zhou, Q., Zhang, Y., Yue, L., Han, C., Yang, B., Wang, Y., Ma, Z., Zhu, L., Liu, C.

PDB patients have larger and more numerous osteoclasts, which leads to characteristic bone erosions along with an increase in rapidly formed, highly disorganized bone as the osteoblastic rebuilding tries to keep pace with the dominant osteoclastic resorption (1Tan A.

Osteoclasts and osteoblasts, along with other bone marrow cells, are constantly in communication to manage proper levels of bone growth. For example, osteoblasts excrete the protein RANKL, which stimulates production of multinucleated osteoclasts from precursor cells in a process called osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 1), which can be detected by readouts such as activation of the transcription factors Nfatc1 and NF-κB. An early study of osteoclastogenesis using precursor cells from p62-deficient mice showed decreased osteoclast formation and decreased Nfatc1/NF-κB activation (3Durán A. Serrano M. Leitges M.

First, they worked with a previously generated mouse model of p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency, which deleted exons 1–4 of the gene and had not been previously investigated for bone phenotypic changes. Second, they used a much reduced cell count in their in vitro differentiation protocols that avoids artificial inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Consistent with previous findings, they found p62 was up-regulated during osteoclastogenesis in WT cultures. Furthermore, p62 deficiency led to an increase in osteoclast nucleation and differentiation and increased sensitivity to RANKL early in culture (i.e. days 3–4). However, no difference in osteoclast number was seen at later time points. These data led the authors to conclude that p62 is a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis, differing from the findings of Duran et al. (3Durán A. Serrano M. Leitges M. Flores J.M. Picard S.

Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar) next investigated the skeletal phenotype of p62-deficient mice, in which previous reports indicated varying degrees of bone volume change. Zach et al. (9Zach F. Polzer F. Mueller A. Gessner A. p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis in vitro and leads to Paget's disease–like bone phenotypes in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar) found that p62-deficient femurs were similar to WT femurs at 3 and 6 months, but there was an increase in bone mass at 9, 12, and 15 months. Histologically, p62-deficient mice had more mature osteoclasts in the lower femurs. Interestingly, closer examination of bones from 21-month-old mice revealed osteolytic lesions in the p62-deficient mice that are consistent with a PDB-like phenotype. Two serum markers of bone turnover were also significantly increased in p62-deficient mice. The work of Zach et al. (9Zach F. Polzer F. Mueller A. Gessner A. p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis in vitro and leads to Paget's disease–like bone phenotypes in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar) brings some clarity to the inconsistent findings about p62 in PDB, and importantly makes available an animal model that mimics human disease. Bone phenotypes depend highly on the mouse background strain, which may explain the differences between the mouse model used by Zach et al. (9Zach F. Polzer F. Mueller A. Gessner A. p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis in vitro and leads to Paget's disease–like bone phenotypes in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar) and those of previous reports. Additionally, due to a late onset of the PDB phenotype in the p62 mouse model of Zach et al. (9Zach F. Polzer F. Mueller A. Gessner A. p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis in vitro and leads to Paget's disease–like bone phenotypes in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar), models that previously did not show a phenotype, or showed local lesions (6Daroszewska A. van 't Hof R.J. Rojas J.A. Layfield R. Landao-Basonga E. Rose L. Rose K. Ralston S.H. A point mutation in the ubiquitin-associated domain of SQSMT1 is sufficient to cause a Paget's disease-like disorder in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2011; 20 (21515589): 2734-274410.1093/hmg/ddr172Google Scholar), may develop lesions in older mice. The mice described in this work can now be used to delve deeper into the mechanisms underpinning PDB and may serve as a model for testing possible therapeutics. The contributions of Zach et al. (9Zach F. Polzer F. Mueller A. Gessner A. p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis in vitro and leads to Paget's disease–like bone phenotypes in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar) also bring up important questions regarding the pathophysiology of PDB. First, what is the role of p62 in osteoclast differentiation? Monocytes and macrophages are given cues that initiate their transformation into osteoclasts. Zach et al. (9Zach F. Polzer F. Mueller A. Gessner A. p62/sequestosome 1 deficiency accelerates osteoclastogenesis in vitro and leads to Paget's disease–like bone phenotypes in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293 (29555685): 9530-954110.1074/jbc.RA118.002449Google Scholar) showed an up-regulation of p62 in culture conditions that promote macrophages relative to in osteoclast cultures, so p62 may maintain monocytes in their more naïve form. This suggests that in the absence of p62, monocyte differentiation is less regulated and an increase in osteoclast differentiation is seen (Fig. 1). It will be interesting to see if this holds true in vivo. Second, what about other cells in the bone marrow microenvironment? Although much of the focus of PDB research is on osteoclasts, osteoblasts are also affected by p62 mutations. Osteoblasts deficient in p62 produce more RANKL, which stimulates osteoclast differentiation (4Hiruma Y. Kurihara N. Subler M.A. Zhou H. Boykin C.S. Zhang H. Ishizuka S. Dempster D.W. Roodman G.D. Windle J.J. A SQSTM1/p62 mutation linked to Paget's disease increases the osteoclastogenic potential of the bone microenvironment.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17 (18765443): 3708-371910.1093/hmg/ddn266Google Scholar). Other cells also regulate osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and activity via secreted factors and direct cell-to-cell contact. For example, Chang et al. (10Chang K.H. Sengupta A. Nayak R.C. Duran A. Lee S.J. Pratt R.G. Wellendorf A.M. Hill S.E. Watkins M. Gonzalez-Nieto D. Aronow B.J. Starczynowski D.T. Civitelli R. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Cancelas J.A. p62 is required for stem cell/progenitor retention through inhibition of IKK/NF-κB/Ccl4 signaling at the bone marrow macrophage-osteoblast niche.Cell Rep. 2014; 9 (25533346): 2084-209710.1016/j.celrep.2014.11.031Google Scholar) found that osteoblast-specific depletion of p62 resulted in low bone mass due to impaired macrophage-dependent osteoblast differentiation. Understanding the role of p62 in cells of the marrow compartment may help uncover non-cell autonomous effects on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. We look forward to these answers and more, as the quest for insights into PDB continues. We thank David Nadziejka for editorial assistance."
