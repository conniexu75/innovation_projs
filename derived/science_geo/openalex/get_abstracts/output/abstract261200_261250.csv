https://openalex.org/W2054265686,"The key challenge in experimental quantum information science is to identify isolated quantum mechanical systems with long coherence times that can be manipulated and coupled together in a scalable fashion. We describe the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin and nearby individual nuclear spins to create a controllable quantum register. Using optical and microwave radiation to control an electron spin associated with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond, we demonstrated robust initialization of electron and nuclear spin quantum bits (qubits) and transfer of arbitrary quantum states between them at room temperature. Moreover, nuclear spin qubits could be well isolated from the electron spin, even during optical polarization and measurement of the electronic state. Finally, coherent interactions between individual nuclear spin qubits were observed and their excellent coherence properties were demonstrated. These registers can be used as a basis for scalable, optically coupled quantum information systems."

Nodule formation has been assumed to be exclusively initiated by the binding of bacterial, host-specific lipochito-oligosaccharidic Nod factors, encoded by the nodABC genes, to kinase-like receptors of the plant. Here we show by complete genome sequencing of two symbiotic, photosynthetic, Bradyrhizobium strains, BTAi1 and ORS278, that canonical nodABC genes and typical lipochito-oligosaccharidic Nod factors are not required for symbiosis in some legumes. Mutational analyses indicated that these unique rhizobia use an alternative pathway to initiate symbioses, where a purine derivative may play a key role in triggering nodule formation."

https://openalex.org/W2017082201,"Proteasomes are responsible for generating peptides presented by the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules of the immune system. Here, we report the identification of a previously unrecognized catalytic subunit called β5t. β5t is expressed exclusively in cortical thymic epithelial cells, which are responsible for the positive selection of developing thymocytes. Although the chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasomes is considered to be important for the production of peptides with high affinities for MHC class I clefts, incorporation of β5t into proteasomes in place of β5 or β5i selectively reduces this activity. We also found that β5t-deficient mice displayed defective development of CD8 + T cells in the thymus. Our results suggest a key role for β5t in generating the MHC class I–restricted CD8 + T cell repertoire during thymic selection."
https://openalex.org/W1995191065,"A detailed reconstruction of West African monsoon hydrology over the past 155,000 years suggests a close linkage to northern high-latitude climate oscillations. Ba/Ca ratio and oxygen isotope composition of planktonic foraminifera in a marine sediment core from the Gulf of Guinea, in the eastern equatorial Atlantic (EEA), reveal centennial-scale variations of riverine freshwater input that are synchronous with northern high-latitude stadials and interstadials of the penultimate interglacial and the last deglaciation. EEA Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were decoupled from northern high-latitude millennial-scale fluctuation and primarily responded to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gases and low-latitude solar insolation. The onset of enhanced monsoon precipitation lags behind the changes in EEA SSTs by up to 7000 years during glacial-interglacial transitions. This study demonstrates that the stadial-interstadial and deglacial climate instability of the northern high latitudes exerts dominant control on the West African monsoon dynamics through an atmospheric linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2130288220,"Human bipedalism is commonly thought to have evolved from a quadrupedal terrestrial precursor, yet some recent paleontological evidence suggests that adaptations for bipedalism arose in an arboreal context. However, the adaptive benefit of arboreal bipedalism has been unknown. Here we show that it allows the most arboreal great ape, the orangutan, to access supports too flexible to be negotiated otherwise. Orangutans react to branch flexibility like humans running on springy tracks, by increasing knee and hip extension, whereas all other primatesdothe reverse. Human bipedalism is thus less an innovation than an exploitation of a locomotor behavior retained from the common great ape ancestor."

https://openalex.org/W2083159612,"The number and morphology of mitochondria within a cell are precisely regulated by the mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery. The human protein, hFis1, participates in mitochondrial fission by recruiting the Drp1 into the mitochondria. Using short hairpin RNA, we reduced the expression levels of hFis1 in mammalian cells. Cells lacking hFis1 showed sustained elongation of mitochondria and underwent significant cellular morphological changes, including enlargement, flattening, and increased cellular granularity. In these cells, staining for acidic senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity was elevated, and the rate of cell proliferation was greatly reduced, indicating that cells lacking hFis1 undergo senescence-associated phenotypic changes. Reintroduction of the hFis1 gene into hFis1-depleted cells restored mitochondrial fragmentation and suppressed senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Moreover, depletion of both hFis1 and OPA1, a critical component of mitochondrial fusion, resulted in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation and markedly rescued cells from senescence-associated phenotypic changes. Intriguingly, sustained elongation of mitochondria was associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species production, and DNA damage. The data indicate that sustained mitochondrial elongation induces senescence-associated phenotypic changes that can be neutralized by mitochondrial fragmentation. Thus, one of the key functions of mitochondrial fission might be prevention of the sustained extensive mitochondrial elongation that triggers cellular senescence.

Thus, one of the key functions of mitochondrial fission might be prevention of the sustained extensive mitochondrial elongation that triggers cellular senescence. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that can change in number and morphology within a cell during development, the cell cycle, or when challenged with various cytotoxic conditions. Size, shape, and interconnectivity of mitochondria are determined by fusion and fission. In mammals, the key molecules for mitochondrial fission are hFis1 and Drp1. The hFis1 protein is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane via a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and overexpression of hFis1 was found to induce mitochondrial fragmentation (1Stojanovski D. Koutsopoulos O.S. Okamoto K. Ryan M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Yu T. Fox R.J. Burwell L.S. Yoon Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4141-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The Drp1 is predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm and partially associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane (3Smirnova E. Griparic L. Shurland D.L. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2245-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). A portion of cytosolic Drp1 can be recruited to mitochondria through an interaction with hFis1 (4Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M.

The opposing process, mitochondrial fusion, is controlled in mammalian cells by Mitofusins (Mfn) 3The abbreviations used are: Mfn, mitofusin; JC-1, 5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3, 30-tetrathylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; TGase 2, transglutaminase 2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RNAi, RNA interference; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; XTT, sodium 3′-1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzene sulfonic acid hydrate. and OPA1. Mitofusin1 and -2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2) localize on the outer membrane of mitochondria and may directly mediate mitochondrial fusion (7Santel A. Fuller M.T. J.

OPA1 (optic atrophy 1) is a dynamin family GTPase that resides in the inter-membrane space of mitochondria and is essential for mitochondrial fusion (10Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Dal Zilio B.

Genet. 2005; 14 (-R289): R283Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, the functional mechanism by which these proteins cooperate to induce mitochondrial fission and fusion remains unidentified. Despite relatively intensive studies on the components of the mitochondrial fission and fusion machineries, a link between mitochondrial dynamics and cellular function is only partly established. Mitochondria undergo morphological change during mating (12Neutzner A. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18598-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Gorsich S.W. Shaw J.M. Mol. Biol.

Reprod. 2000; 15: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dramatic shape changes of mitochondria occur during cell death. During the early step of apoptosis, the mitochondrial network disintegrates, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation and condensation (16Mancini M. Anderson B.O. Caldwell E. Sedghinasab M. Paty P.B.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Upon induction of apoptosis, Drp1 translocates to the potential scission sites of mitochondria (20Frank S. Gaume B.

Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar) and Bax co-localizes with Drp1 and Mfn2 at distinct foci on mitochondria (21Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B.

Recently, OPA1, along with rhomboid PARL, has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis by controlling the remodeling of mitochondrial cristae (23Cipolat S. Scorrano L.

Jeong S.Y. Youle R.J. Nature. 2006; 443: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) are essential for mitochondrial morphogenesis in healthy cells. These findings suggest that mitochondrial dynamics plays an important role in both cellular functions involved in cell survival and cell death. Inhibition of mitochondrial fusion significantly affects cellular function. Disruption of mitochondrial fusion by knockdown of Mfns or OPA1 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, and targeted null mutations of either Mfn1 or Mfn2 in mice triggered mid-gestational lethality (9Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). Mfn-null or OPA1-RNAi cells show severe defects in mitochondrial fusion as well as cellular dysfunctions, including poor cell growth and decreased cellular respiration (26Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Notably, mutations in genes controlling mitochondrial fusion have been directly associated with several human diseases. Mutations in Mfn2 were found in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2A (27Kijima K. Numakura C. Izumino H. Umetsu K. Nezu A. Shiiki T. Ogawa M. Ishizaki Y. Kitamura T. Shozawa Y.

Brain. 2006; 129: 2093-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and mutations in the OPA1 gene have been shown to cause dominant optic atrophy (29Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie-Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat.

Thus, defects in mitochondrial fusion cause cellular dysfunctions that relate to different human diseases. So far, however, it is unclear how defects in mitochondrial fission, which result in the formation of elongated net-like structures, affect cellular function. In this study, we have focused on clarifying the cellular functions of mitochondrial fission by efficiently blocking the fission event using hFis1 RNAi. Our results reveal that hFis1 knockdown leads to sustained mitochondrial elongation and senescence-associated phenotypic changes, and further show that these changes could be suppressed by reconstitution of mitochondrial fission, suggesting that mitochondrial fission opposing mitochondrial fusion is required for normal cell growth in mammalian cells. Here we report and discuss a novel cellular function of mitochondrial fission, a defense role against stress-induced cellular senescence. Reagents and Antibodies—MitoTracker Red™ CMXRos, 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, and 5,50,6,60-tetrachloro-1,10,3,30-tetrathylbenzimidazole carbocyanide iodide (JC-1) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The polyethyleneimine used for DNA transfection was purchased from Polysciences (Warrington, PA), and hygromycin B was from Roche Applied Science. The anti-hFis1 antibody was kindly provided Mark A. McNiven (Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN). The antibody against γ-H2AX and α-tubulin was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and Calbiochem. The anti-β-actin and anti-c-Myc antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture, RNAi by shRNA Gene Silencing System, and Transfection—Chang (CCL-13, ATCC) and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. RNAi was performed using the short hairpin-activated gene silencing system (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The plasmids containing hFis1 shRNA or OPA1 shRNA mRNA sequences (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) were expressed under the pREP4 (Invitrogen), which allows for long term suppression of gene expression. These shRNA systems were shown to specifically suppress hFis1 and OPA1 gene expression in HeLa cells (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). One day after transfection with these pREP4 constructs using polyethyleneimine, Chang or HeLa cells were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml hygromycin B for 2 days. Any dying cells were removed by brief centrifugation, and the cells selected were reseeded on the plates, which is designated as day 0, and further grown in DMEM containing 30 μg/ml hygromycin B for the indicated times. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Chang cells expressing appropriate RNAi constructs were seeded onto coverslips and grown in the DMEM containing 30 μg/ml hygromycin B. For visualization of mitochondria, cells were stained for 30 min with 125 nm MitoTracker Red™ and fixed in a solution of methanol:acetone (1:1) for 10 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized for 5 min in PBS containing 0.075% Triton X-100, preincubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS), and then incubated overnight with appropriate primary antibodies at 4 °C. The cells were then washed, probed with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody, and mounted for microscopic observation. For analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were incubated for 20 min in culture medium containing 5 μg/ml JC-1 and analyzed by microscopy. All images were captured with an LSM510 Zeiss confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Assay—Senescence-associated β-galactosidase was assayed at pH 6.0 (32Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) for 10 min. After fixation, cells washed with PBS and then incubated overnight in freshly prepared staining solution (40 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Roche Applied Science), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide (Sigma), 5 mm potassium ferricyanide (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2). After incubation for 48 h, senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive cells were counted. The results are the average of at least three independent experiments. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell proliferation was determined by evaluating metabolically active cells using an XTT assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, RNAi-transfected cells were plated at a density of 1 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate in the presence of 30 μg/ml hygromycin B. After incubation for indicated days, 50 μl containing the XTT labeling mixture, XTT labeling reagent, and electron coupling reagent was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Absorbance generated by the formazan product was measured at 450 nm using an automatic microplate reader. The presented results are the average of at least three independent experiments. For viable cell counting, cells were plated in a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well plate in the presence of 30 μg/ml hygromycin B. Each indicated day, cell numbers were counted using hemocytometer after trypan blue staining in four independent experiments. Analysis of Cellular Granularity, Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential (Δψm), and Intracellular ROS Levels and by Flow Cytometry—Cellular granularity was quantified by analyzing the 90° side light scatter under flow cytometry. To assess changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), cells transfected with the shRNA constructs were incubated for 20 min with 5 μg/ml of JC-1 fluorescent dye and washed with PBS. For quantification of Δψm disruption, JC-1-stained cells were collected by trypsinization, and the green fluorescence intensities (representing the degree of Δψm disruption) were measured by flow cytometry (FACS Vantage, BD Biosciences). Intracellular ROS levels were determined by staining cells with 10 mm of DCFH-DA fluorescence dye for 20 min, and the fluorescent intensities were also quantified by flow cytometry. The presented results are the average of at least three independent experiments. Immunoblotting—Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equivalent amounts of proteins were run on polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted. The immunoblots were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To synthesize first strand cDNA, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus (Takara, Japan). The synthesized cDNAs were amplified in triplicate using specific primers. The primers used were as follows: TGase 2 sense primer, 5′-CTCGTGGAGCCAGTTATCAACAGCTAC-3′; TGase 2 antisense primer, 5′-TCTCGAAGTTCACCACCAGCTTGTG-3′; hFis1 sense primer, 5′-GTCGACATGGAGGCCGTGCTGAAC-3′; hFis1 antisense primer, 5′-CGGCCGTCAGGATTTGGACTTGGA-3′; GAPDH sense primer, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′; and GAPDH antisense primer, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′. Statistical Analyses—The error bars on figures represent the mean ± S.D. of all determinations. All the experiments were repeated at least three times. Two-sided unpaired t tests were used to assess statistical significance. Knockdown of hFis1 Induces Senescence-associated Phenotypic Changes—To investigate the cellular consequences of hFis1 depletion, we used the pREP4 plasmid harboring U6-hFis1 shRNA inserts for RNA interference of endogenous hFis1 mRNA levels in Chang and HeLa cells (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were initially selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin B and then maintained in the presence of 30 μg/ml hygromycin B. Western blotting confirmed the diminished level of hFis1 in cells (Fig. 1B) where the 1st day of incubation with the lower concentration of hygromycin B was designated as day 0. Most cells transfected with the control shRNA showed a normal short tubular mitochondrial structure (Fig. 1A, upper panel), whereas more than 70% of the hFis1 knockdown cells had an elongated, net-like structure of mitochondria (Fig. 1A, lower panel) as observed previously (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), and the remaining cells showed a normal short tubular mitochondrial structure as control cells (Fig. 1C). Both Chang and HeLa cells displayed the same morphological changes of mitochondria after hFis1 RNAi (data not shown). Notably, the hFis1 knockdown cells exhibited significant cellular morphological changes. The hFis1 knockdown cells started becoming progressively flattened on day 2 and were obviously flattened and enlarged on day 4 (Fig. 2A), showing a phenotype similar to that of cells undergoing senescence. Typically, cells entering senescence remain in a nondividing state and undergo dramatic changes in cellular morphology with increased cellular granularity (33Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 34Campisi J. In Vivo (Athens). 2000; 14: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The changes in cell granularity were assessed by flow cytometry. The 90° side light scatter values were significantly higher in the hFis1 knockdown cells than in control cells, showing 2-fold increase on day 2 and ∼3-fold increase on day 4 (Fig. 2B). Microscopic evaluations revealed that the proliferation of hFis1-depleted cells was noticeably slow. Indeed, cell growth of the hFis1-depleted cells was found to be significantly retarded in measuring cell numbers (Fig. 2C) and by XTT assays (data not shown). To assess whether these senescence phenotypes are caused by an hFis1 depletion-specific event, we established the cell lines stably overexpressing the Mfn1 or Drp1K38A gene. These cells exhibited mild phenotypes in mitochondrial elongation as well as in morphological changes of senescence (data not shown). Collectively, these findings indicate that the sustained extensive elongation of mitochondria accompanies the senescence-associated morphological changes. Senescence-associated-β-galactosidase activity has been used as a reliable biochemical marker for cellular senescence (33Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 34Campisi J. In Vivo (Athens). 2000; 14: 183-188PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). On days 4 and 5, ∼30% of the hFis1 RNAi cells stained positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (Fig. 2, D and E; blue-colored cells), whereas no staining was observed in control cells. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of hFis1 RNAi cells for expression of TGase 2, being up-regulated in senescent cells (36Shin D.M. Jeon J.H. Kim C.W. Cho S.Y. Kwon J.C. Lee H.J. Choi K.H. Park S.C.

Together, these results indicate that prolonged depletion of hFis1 can induce senescence-associated phenotypic changes. Reconstitution of hFis1 to the hFis1-depleted Cells Reduces Positive Senescence-associated β-Galactosidase Staining—To confirm that the observed senescence-associated phenotypic changes in hFis1 RNAi cells were the result of hFis1 depletion, we reconstituted hFis1 expression in the hFis1 RNAi cells using a vector encoding a Myc-tagged wild type hFis1 cDNA. Because the RNAi target sequence corresponds to 3′-untranslated region of hFis1 cDNA, reconstituted hFis1, which does not contain the RNAi target sequence, can be expressed in hFis1 RNAi cells. The myc-hFis1 plasmid was transfected into the hFis1 RNAi cells, and immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody confirmed the expression of Myc-tagged hFis1 (Fig. 3C). Microscopy analysis revealed that the reintroduction of hFis1 triggered fragmentation of the extended tubular mitochondrial network induced by hFis1 depletion, and the re-expressed Myc-hFis1 was co-localized to the fragmented mitochondria (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the reintroduction of hFis1 mutant lacking the transmembrane domain (hFis1ΔTM) could not be recruited to mitochondria nor induce mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 3A). Restoration of hFis1 expression in hFis1 RNAi cells caused a significant reduction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase, but no effect was observed by introduction of hFis1ΔTM (Fig. 3B). In addition, overexpression of Drp1 neither induced mitochondrial fragmentation (data not shown) nor rescued cells from senescence-associated changes in hFis1-depleted cells (Fig. 3B), suggesting that additional Drp1 overexpression without appropriate interaction with hFis1 cannot induce mitochondrial fission. Because hFis1 knockdown by itself did not affect endogenous cellular levels of mitochondrial fission and fusion molecules (data not shown), including Drp1 (Fig. 3D), we conclude that hFis1 depletion did indeed cause the observed senescence-associated phenotypic changes. OPA1 Knockdown Reverses the hFis1 Knockdown-induced Senescence-associated Phenotypic Changes—We next speculated that if the prolonged mitochondrial elongation induced by hFis1 depletion caused senescence-associated changes, then inhibition of mitochondrial fusion leading to mitochondrial fragmentation in these cells might counteract those changes. Inhibition of mitochondrial fusion can be induced either by depletion of Mfns or OPA1 (26Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Cells depleted of OPA1 showed severe mitochondrial fragmentation, and simultaneous silencing of the genes encoding OPA1 and hFis1 also triggered extensive mitochondria fragmentation in Chang cells (Fig. 4A), consistent with the previous observation in HeLa cells (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Notably, the senescent cell morphology (flattening) was significantly decreased in the double RNAi cells (supplemental Fig. 1). Diminished levels of hFis1 and OPA1 were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, hFis1 and OPA1 double-knockdown cells showed significant decreases in positive senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining (Fig. 4C; supplemental Fig. 2) as well as in cellular granularity (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, we also found that a dramatic retardation of cell growth in hFis1 knockdown cells was restored in double RNAi cells (Fig. 4E). This rules out off-target effects of the hFis1 RNAi that could be involved in senescence induction, and indicates that mitochondrial fusion unbalanced by fission is the cause. Moreover, given that elongation of mitochondria would be a causative factor for the senescence, overexpression of OPA1 increasing mitochondrial fusion could induce similar senescence-associated changes of cells. We found that overexpression of YFP-OPA1 fusion protein properly targeted to mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 3) induced mitochondrial fusion and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (Student’s t test, p < 0.05). However, mitochondrial elongation and interconnection induced by OPA1 overexpression was never as serious as those found in hFis1 knockdown cells. It is likely that the intracellular level of OPA1 is not a limiting factor in the control of the mitochondrial fusion process, and under those conditions mitochondrial fission molecules still counteract mitochondrial elongation. Contrary to previous reports (26Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 37Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), we did not observe cell growth inhibition in OPA1 RNAi cells (Fig. 4E; supplemental Fig. 2). This is likely due to the fact that our selection protocol included the removal of early apoptotic cells from the OPA1 RNAi cultures, and we analyzed the cells capable of surviving under the low concentration of hygromycin B. These findings collectively indicate that sustained mitochondrial elongation, not just inhibition of mitochondrial fission per se, may be the primary cause of senescence-associated changes in hFis1 knockdown cells. The hFis1 Depletion Leads to Changes in Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and ROS Production and Induces DNA Damage—We sought to identify the signals involved in triggering hFis1 depletion-induced senescence-associated changes. Cellular senescence can be induced by sub-lethal stresses, such as accumulation of ROS and DNA damage (35Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined ROS levels in hFis1-depleted cells, using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining and flow cytometric measurement of changes in fluorescent intensity. We found that prolonged depletion of hFis1 in fact increased ROS production on day 4 (Fig. 5A). Moreover, sustained depletion of hFis1 caused a significant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm; Fig. 5B). In control RNAi cells, high (red fluorescence) and low (green) Δψm values were equally abundant (Fig. 5B, right) after staining with the Δψm-sensitive JC-1 fluorescence dye. In contrast, mitochondria in the hFis1-depleted cells showed a significant reduction of red fluorescence but an increase of green fluorescence. Flow cytometric increase of green fluorescent intensity in hFis1-depleted cells indicated an increased population of mitochondria with low Δψm in these cells. Although both TMRE/TMRM and JC-1 reflect the status of Δψm, we experienced that quantification of fluorescent intensities after TMRE/TMRM staining can be interfered with by extensive mitochondrial elongation or by increased mitochondria mass (data not shown). Finally, we examined the possibility of DNA damage in hFis1 RNAi cells. It is known that γ-H2AX, a histone H2A variant, is phosphorylated upon DNA damage and moves to the DNA damage foci (38Zgheib O. Huyen Y. DiTullio Jr., R.A. Snyder A. Venere M. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Radiother. Oncol. 2005; 76: 119-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Likewise, the phosphorylated γ-H2AX foci in the nuclei of hFis1-depleted cells were significantly elevated with ∼40% of the cells on day 4 (Fig. 5C), indicating that DNA strand breakage occurs in these cells. Thus, prolonged depletion of hFis1 induces loss of Δψm, accumulation of ROS, and DNA strand breakage, which may at least partly contribute to the observed senescence-associated phenotypic changes. One major mystery of mitochondrial biology is the cellular roles of mitochondrial dynamics, and researchers have yet to firmly establish a link between mitochondrial dynamics and cellular function. Here we demonstrate that the sustained extensive mitochondrial elongation caused by hFis1 depletion induces senescence-associated phenotypic changes. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that mitochondrial fission, the opposing force that counters mitochondrial fusion, is indispensable for normal cell growth and function in mammalian cells. Two recent studies suggested that giant mitochondria might involve cellular senescence in mammalian and plant cells (39Yoon Y.S. Yoon D.S. Lim I.K. Yoon S.H. Chung H.Y. Rojo M. Malka F. Jou M.J. Martinou J.C. Yoon G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 40Zottini M. Barizza E. Bastianelli F. Carimi F. Lo Schiavo F. New Phytol. 2006; 172: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In particular, elongated giant mitochondria have been observed in senescence models induced by treatment with desferoxamine or H2O2, and their emergence has been correlated with reduction in hFis1 levels during senescent progression (39Yoon Y.S. Yoon D.S. Lim I.K. Yoon S.H. Chung H.Y. Rojo M. Malka F. Jou M.J. Martinou J.C. Yoon G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These results strongly support our findings that balanced fission mediated by hFis1 is important for proper cell growth. Senescent cells are defined by their characteristic phenotypes. They remain in a nondividing state accompanied by dramatic cellular and morphological changes (35Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 41Ishikawa F. Cornea. 2006; 25 (-S6): S3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replicative senescence refers to a state that occurs following extended cell proliferation and division. Alternatively, cells subjected to sublethal stresses such as accumulation of ROS and oxidative stress, hyperoncogenic activation, DNA damage, and telomere shortening enter a state of stress-induced premature senescence (35Ben-Porath I. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 42Lee H.C. Wei Y.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 822-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 43Schmitt C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1775: 5-20PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that sustained inhibition of mitochondrial fission behaves as a sub-lethal stress. Notably, hFis1-depleted cells showed prolonged mitochondrial elongation and progressive senescence, in association with a series of dramatic phenotypic changes. This result differs from the previous report that mitochondrial fusion complements mtDNA mutations (44Nakada K. Inoue K. Ono T. Isobe K. Ogura A. Goto Y.I. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.I. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 934-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and thus could be seen as a defense against senescence. It is thought that fused mitochondrial filaments may compensate for uneven oxygen supplies and may distribute energy more evenly throughout the cell (45Ono T. Isobe K. Nakada K. Hayashi J.I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, the prolonged mitochondrial elongation (fusion) in hFis1-depleted cells appears to differ from normal mitochondrial fusion events. Indeed, our results indicate that cells harboring prolonged mitochondrial elongation show increased ROS levels and decreased Δψm. Interestingly, in cells depleted of both hFis1 and OPA1, senescent-associated changes were significantly suppressed, and cell proliferation rate was restored where mitochondria remained severely fragmented (Fig. 5). Depletion of OPA1 is known to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 37Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that OPA1-mediates regulation of mitochondrial cristae remodeling that is independent of the mitochondrial fusion process (24Frezza C. Cipolat S. Martins de Brito O. Micaroni M. Beznoussenko G.V. Rudka T. Bartoli D. Polishuck R.S. Danial N.N. De Strooper B. Scorrano L. Cell. 2006; 126: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Although depletion of OPA1 initially increased the population of apoptotic cells in cultures containing a high concentration of hygromycin B during transfectant selection, in the absence of an external apoptotic stimulus, the remaining cells appeared healthy and showed normal cell proliferation rates in the presence of a lower concentration of antibiotic (Fig. 5). Simultaneous depletion of hFis1 and OPA1 or sequential depletion of OPA1 followed by hFis1 shRNA transfection resulted in the same severe mitochondrial fragmentation, indicating that mitochondria were predominantly fragmented in the absence of an active fusion process as reported previously (31Lee Y.J. Jeong S.Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) and, remarkably, blocked senescence induction. This rules out off-target effects of the hFis1 RNAi that could be involved in senescence induction and indicates that mitochondrial fusion unbalanced by fission is the cause. In conclusion, these data suggest that sustained mitochondrial elongation, not just inhibition of mitochondrial fission per se, may be a primary cause for senescence-associated cellular changes and further suggest that dynamic mitochondrial fission is needed to prevent cells from undergoing senescence-associated phenotypic changes.

Consequently, it encodes mechanisms to prevent cell death during infection. Using rotenone, a potent inhibitor of the mitochondrial enzyme complex I (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–ubiquinone oxido-reductase), we found that human cytomegalovirus infection protected cells from rotenone-induced apoptosis, a protection mediated by a 2.7-kilobase virally encoded RNA (β2.7). During infection, β2.7 RNA interacted with complex I and prevented the relocalization of the essential subunit genes associated with retinoid/interferon–induced mortality–19, in response to apoptotic stimuli. This interaction, which is important for stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential, resulted in continued adenosine triphosphate production, which is critical for the successful completion of the virus' life cycle. Complex I targeting by a viral RNA represents a refined strategy to modulate the metabolic viability of the infected host cell."

Data from experiments performed on iron-sulfur and iron-nickel-sulfur systems at pressures corresponding to the center of Mars indicate that its core is presently completely liquid and that it will not form an outwardly crystallizing iron-rich inner core, as does Earth. Instead, planetary cooling will lead to core crystallization following either a ""snowing-core"" model, whereby iron-rich solids nucleate in the outer portions of the core and sink toward the center, or a ""sulfide inner-core"" model, where an iron-sulfide phase crystallizes to form a solid inner core."

The interactions at play are known to fall outside the scope of the standard model of metals, but a fundamental question remains: Is the basic concept of a quasiparticle—a fermion with renormalized mass—still valid in such systems? The Wiedemann-Franz law, which states that the ratio of heat and charge conductivities in a metal is a universal constant in the limit of zero temperature, is a robust consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics. We report a violation of this law in the heavy-fermion metal CeCoIn 5 when tuned to its quantum critical point, depending on the direction of electron motion relative to the crystal lattice, which points to an anisotropic destruction of the Fermi surface."

The ability of CHIP to recognize nonnative protein structure may aid in selection of slow folding or misfolded polypeptides for ubiquitination. Cells must constantly monitor the folding status of nascent polypeptides and repair or degrade misfolded proteins during protein denaturing stress. To accomplish these tasks, the cell relies on an intricately regulated protein quality control (QC) 5The abbreviations used are: QC, quality control; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GdmHCl, guanidinium HCl; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase. system. The cytosolic QC system consists of molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp40, that promote the proper folding and refolding of nonnative proteins and the ubiquitin proteasome system, which degrades misfolded or stress-damaged proteins (1Hershko A.

Maintenance of cellular homeostasis requires a delicate balance between that activity of protein folding and ubiquitin proteasome systems. Under circumstances where the molecular chaperone system is unable to promote proper folding of a protein substrate to its native state, it is necessary for the substrate protein to be selected for degradation, a process that is often referred to as protein triage (5Wickner S.

CHIP is a co-chaperone that functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that links the polypeptide binding activity of Hsp70 to the ubiquitin proteasome system.

This is an important question, because productive folding intermediates and misfolded proteins that are bound by Hsp70 appear to have similar conformations, and it does not appear that folding kinetics are the sole determinant of a nonnative protein's fate (5Wickner S.

In addition, a number of Hsp70 co-chaperones possess an intrinsic polypeptide binding activity and act independently to suppress protein aggregation (29Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.U.

Based on these observations, we tested whether CHIP could function as an autonomous molecular chaperone. We report that CHIP exhibits intrinsic chaperone function that enables it to bind nonnative substrates and suppress protein aggregation. In addition, CHIP chaperone activity was found to be enhanced by heat stress. These data suggest that the ability of CHIP to function as a chaperone is an important feature of its action in protein triage and cell stress protection. Cell Culture—AD-HEK293 cells from Stratagene were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin; Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cell transfections were performed using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) with the indicated amounts of plasmid DNA. Cell Culture Luciferase Assay—AD-HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the luciferase-encoding plasmid, pGL3 (Promega), and with 0.25 μg of pCDNA3.1 myc-CHIP. Transfected cells were allowed to recover for 24 h and were then treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 30 min at 37 °C. Following the cycloheximide incubation, cells were either maintained at 37 °C or heat-stressed at 45 °C for 30 min. Recovery periods of 0, 1, or 3 h at 37°C were allowed, and then cells were assayed for luciferase activity according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega) or were harvested by citric saline and lysed in an ATP-regenerating buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.25 mg/ml creatine kinase for immunoprecipitation analysis. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by the subsequent addition of goat α-luciferase antibody (Millipore) or rabbit α-Hsp70 antibody (SPA-757, Stressgen) and Protein G beads (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by Western blot. Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking of Cell Lysates—AD-HEK293 cells transfected with pCDNA3.1 myc-CHIP (0.5 μg) were lysed 24 h post-transfection in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 120 mm NaCl. Cell lysates were incubated at 4, 37, 42, or 45 °C for 15 min, and then either water or glutaraldehyde (0.025% final concentration) was added to the cell lysates (34Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cross-linking reaction was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then reactions were stopped by the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were run on 10% gels and blotted for the presence of CHIP with an α-Myc antibody (Sigma). Protein Purification Procedures—The following plasmids were used for overexpression of the indicated proteins in the BL21 E. coli strain: pET9d-Hdj2, pET11a-Hsc70 (32Meacham G.C. Lu Z. King S.

Untagged CHIP was expressed by inducing BL21 cells expressing pet11-CHIP with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cleared lysates were obtained by sonication and centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 10 min, and then CHIP was purified by High Q anion exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). All of the above proteins were dialyzed into buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.4). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HD53Q-Myc proteins were purified from bacteria induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside by incubating the cleared lysate with GSH beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, which were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Bound protein was eluted with 10 mm GSH, and samples were dialyzed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 150 mm NaCl. Huntingtin Aggregation Assay—GST-HD53Q-Myc fusion protein (3 μm) was incubated at 30 °C with 2.5 units of PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) in Buffer B (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,50 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 8 mm creatine phosphate) plus the indicated proteins for 3 h. Cleavage of the GST tag allows for aggregation and fibril formation to occur (33Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Aggregation reactions were either stopped by the addition of an equal volume of a 4% SDS, 50 mm DTT solution followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min for filter trap analysis or mixed with 4× native gel sample buffer (0.24 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 1% Bromphenol Blue) and run on a 7% native gel. Filter trap analysis was carried out with cellulose acetate filters (0.2-μm pore size) using a Bio-Rad Slot Blot apparatus. HD-53Q-Myc protein was visualized by performing a Western blot using an α-Myc antibody (Sigma). Luciferase Native Gel Assay—To examine the state of denatured luciferase, the luciferase was incubated in denaturation buffer (25 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,6 m guanidinium HCl (GdmHCl), 5 mm DTT) for 1 h at 25°C. The denatured luciferase was then diluted into refolding buffer (25 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) with the indicated mixture of proteins and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C before the addition of 4× native sample buffer (0.24 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 1% bromphenol blue) and application to a 7% native polyacrylamide gel. In Vitro Oligomerization Assay—Proteins were diluted in Buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4)) to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Samples were then incubated at either 4 or 42 °C for 15 min. 4× native sample buffer (0.24 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 1% bromphenol blue) was added to each sample, and they were then applied to 7% native polyacrylamide gels, which were prepared according to the Laemmli method without SDS. The running buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris and 384 mm glycine. Gels were run for 3.5 h at a constant current of 15 mA. Luciferase Aggregation Assay—Luciferase was diluted to a final concentration of 100 nm in reactions containing the indicated proteins in 120 mm NaCl, 40 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm DTT. Aliquots of each reaction were stored on ice to represent total protein levels. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min, followed by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C for native luciferase and a 15-min incubation at 42 °C for heat-denatured luciferase. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (Beckman Allegra 64R centrifuge; 4 °C), after which the supernatants were separated from the pellet. Pellets were resuspended in a volume of 4% SDS, 350 mm β-mercaptoethanol, representing 5 times the volume that was originally centrifuged. The total aliquots and supernatants were also diluted 1:5 in 4% SDS, 350 mm β-mercaptoethanol. All fractions were heated at 55 °C for 10 min and then were applied to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad slot blot apparatus. Western blots were performed using an α-luciferase antibody (Cortex). Luciferase Holding and Refolding Assay—Refolding of chemically denatured firefly luciferase (Promega) was carried out as described previously (35Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5970-5978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase (14.2 mg/ml) was diluted 42-fold into denaturation buffer (25 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,6 m guanidinium HCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The denaturation reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 25°C, and then a 1-μl aliquot was removed and mixed with 125 μl of refolding buffer (25 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) that was supplemented with the indicated chaperone proteins and incubated at 25 °C. Where indicated, after 90 min, the reaction was split into two, and 1.5 μm Ssa1 and 5.5 μm Ydj1 was added to one half of the reaction, whereas Buffer A was added to the other half. The reactions were then incubated for another 30 min at 25 °C. Aliquots of 1 μl were removed from the folding reactions and mixed with 60 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was then measured with a Turner TD-20/20 Luminometer. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to Measure Polypeptide Binding by Hsp70—A previously established ELISA was used to measure complex formation between Hsp70 proteins and denatured luciferase (36Lee S. Fan C.Y. Younger J.M. Ren H. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21675-21682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Hsp70 was diluted into PBS. Then 100-μl aliquots of 50 nm Hsp70 solutions were added to the wells of microtiter plates. The Hsp70 was allowed to adhere to the walls of wells during a 1-h incubation at 25 °C. Wells were washed to remove unbound Hsp70 with 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100 (PBST). Wells were blocked via a 1-h incubation with 200 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. GdmHCl-denatured luciferase (0.4 μg) was diluted into reactions containing the indicated amounts of CHIP in PBS with 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP and then added to each well. After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the wells were washed three times with PBST. Luciferase retained in the wells was detected with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit α-luciferase (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA) in PBST. α-Luciferase was incubated in the wells for 1 h at 25°C, and then following three washes with PBST, goat α-rabbit serum coupled with horseradish peroxidase was used to detect the luciferase antibody retained in the wells. Three more washes with PBST were performed to wash away any unbound secondary antibody. Hydrogen peroxide (0.05% final concentration) was added to a solution containing 0.22 mg/ml 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0. This 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) solution was added to the wells of the microtiter plate, and color formation was measured at 405 nm with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Rhodanese Aggregation Assay—Rhodanese aggregation was determined using light scattering as previously described (37Cyr D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In brief, bovine rhodanese (50 μm; Sigma) was denatured for 1 h at 25 °C in 6 m guanidine HCl buffered with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm DTT. Upon denaturation, rhodanese was diluted 100-fold into 400 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm KCl, and 10 mm DTT. If included, chaperones were added to the reaction mixture prior to the addition of denatured rhodanese. In order to prepare the heat-shocked CHIP, an aliquot of CHIP was placed at 42 °C for 15 min and set on ice for 3 min before being diluted 10-fold into the reaction mixture. The rate of rhodanese aggregation was determined by observing the increase in light scattering in the sample over time using a spectrophotometer set at 320 nm. Ubiquitination Assays —Ubiquitination assays were performed in a reaction buffer composed of 20 mm K-Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine ubiquitin (Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml rabbit E1 (Calbiochem), 8 μm UbcH5a, and 4 μm CHIP unless otherwise indicated. Additional proteins were added at the indicated concentrations. Incubations were performed at 37 °C for 3 h and terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by blotting with the indicated antibodies. Characterization of CHIP Activity during Heat Stress and Recovery—To expand our knowledge of CHIP action in protein triage, we sought to understand the enigmatic observation that overexpression of CHIP in cultured cells enhances refolding of heat-denatured luciferase (18Kampinga H.H. Kanon B. Salomons F.A. Kabakov A.E. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4948-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This result was puzzling, because purified CHIP functions with Hsp70 to polyubiquitinate misfolded luciferase (38Murata S. Minami Y. Minami M. Chiba T. Tanaka K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) and therefore CHIP would be expected to clear denatured luciferase from the cell instead of enhancing its reactivation. To determine the mechanism by which CHIP influences denatured luciferase activity, HEK-AD 293 cells were transfected with luciferase and CHIP expression plasmids. Then luciferase activity as well as complex formation between CHIP and luciferase were analyzed following heat denaturation. Heat stress reduced luciferase activity by almost 80% in control cells, and luciferase activity was partially recovered during a poststress recovery incubation at 37 °C. Consistent with an earlier report (18Kampinga H.H. Kanon B. Salomons F.A. Kabakov A.E. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4948-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), luciferase activity was consistently higher in cells overexpressing CHIP (Fig. 1A). However, the effect of CHIP on luciferase activity following heat stress was somewhat variable, because when identical experiments were carried out with high passage number cells (i.e. passage 50 versus passage 15), luciferase activity immediately following heat shock was decreased in response to CHIP overexpression (data not shown). However, in all cases, the rate at which luciferase activity was restored after heat stress was enhanced by CHIP overexpression. Western blots indicated that differences in luciferase activity observed were not due to the presence of different levels of total luciferase protein in different cell extracts (Fig. 1B). Thus, the presence of abnormally high levels of CHIP, which are likely to exceed the levels of its cognate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5, helps maintain a pool of denatured luciferase in a folding-competent and reactivable state. Hsp70 and CHIP were both shown by co-immunoprecipitation to bind heat-stressed luciferase (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the number of Hsp70-luciferase complexes that were isolated increased a few-fold in the presence of excess CHIP (Fig. 1B). The association of CHIP with luciferase appeared to be conformationally specific, because it was found to associate with inactive luciferase in heat-treated cells but not in controls where it was fully active (Fig. 1B). Indeed, as the luciferase refolded during the recovery period, the amount of CHIP isolated in a complex with luciferase decreased in a manner that was proportional to increases in luciferase activity. Hsp70-dependent and -independent Effects of CHIP on Denatured Substrates—Whether the interactions between luciferase and CHIP are due to a direct binding of luciferase to CHIP or an effect of CHIP on Hsp70 binding to luciferase is difficult to evaluate in cultured cells. Therefore, we set out to determine if purified CHIP could function as a chaperone and bind nonnative polypeptides independent of Hsp70. Luciferase was chemically denatured with GdmHCl and then diluted into a refolding buffer containing CHIP, Hsp40, Hsp70, or different combinations thereof. Native gels were utilized to detect the amount of luciferase that formed a complex with the different chaperone proteins and therefore could enter the native gel matrix (Fig. 2A). In the absence of chaperones, negligible quantities of denatured luciferase entered the native gel matrix (Fig. 2A), which makes it difficult to quantitate the absolute percentage of luciferase that is bound by chaperone proteins. However, in comparison with the negative control (luciferase diluted into buffer), CHIP was able to bind and shift 38% (average value from three independent experiments) more luciferase into the gel, which is impressive when considering that the combination of Hsp40 and Hsp70 together led to a 25% increase in luciferase migration into the gel (average value from three independent experiments). These results indicate that CHIP is able to bind a denatured substrate independent of interactions with Hsp70. However, the most dramatic gel shift results were observed in the presence of Hsp40, Hsp70, and CHIP together. The combination of all three chaperones resulted in a 100% increase in the amount of luciferase migrating into the native gel matrix (average value from three independent experiments). This value surpasses that of a simple additive effect from the three proteins and suggests that Hsp40 and CHIP act jointly to enhance complex formation between Hsp70 and denatured luciferase. The apparent cooperative action of Hsp40 and C"

These processes involve the slow decay of chemically recalcitrant compounds and physical protection. To assess the importance of physical protection, we constructed a reaction-diffusion model in which organic matter differs only in its accessibility to microbial degradation but not its intrinsic reactivity. The model predicts that organic matter decays logarithmically with time t and that decay rates decrease approximately as 0.2 x t(-1) until burial. Analyses of sediment-core data are consistent with these predictions."

In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms whereby insulin-like growth factor-I signaling, through the insulin-like growth factor type-I receptor, mediates the sustained phosphorylation of Akt. We showed that insulin-like growth factor-I stimulation induced loss of receptors from the cell surface but that surface receptors recovered over time.

Moreover the insulin-like growth factor type-I receptor localized with the transferrin receptor and Rab11-positive endosomes in a ligand-dependent manner, further supporting the conclusion that this receptor follows a recycling pathway. Our results provide evidence that ligand stimulation leads to internalization of the insulin-like growth factor type-I receptor, which mediates Akt phosphorylation, and that receptor recycling sustains Akt phosphorylation in glial progenitors.

Receptor tyrosine kinases mediate the activity of various signal transduction pathways, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, migration, or differentiation. Classically the activity of these signaling pathways is transient because receptor tyrosine kinases often are internalized followed by ligand/receptor dissociation and degradation. This paradigm of transient receptor tyrosine kinase signaling leading to ligand and receptor degradation has been well studied, particularly for the epidermal growth factor receptor, and is thought to be a major mechanism for the termination of signal transduction (1Levkowitz G.

Although the downstream properties of IGF-IR signaling have been well studied, less is known about the subcellular trafficking of the IGF-IR and regulation of signaling pathway activation in neural cells. Moreover few studies have reported long term receptor stability and downstream activity for the IGF-IR or other receptor tyrosine kinases (18Cui Q.L. Zheng W.H. Quirion R. Almazan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8918-8928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of considerable interest to understand the mechanisms by which the IGF-IR sustains the phosphorylation of Akt and promotes long term survival of progenitor cells in the central nervous system. The temporal and spatial regulation of signal transduction has been attributed to the subcellular localization of receptors and their downstream effector molecules (19Haugh J.M. Mol. Interv. 2002; 2: 292-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). That signal transduction occurs rapidly and with high fidelity lends support to the hypothesis that receptors and signaling molecules are organized into specific subcellular compartments. Surface-localized receptor tyrosine kinases activate distinct signaling pathways compared with internalized, endosome-associated receptor tyrosine kinases leading to specific biological responses (20Jullien J. Guili V. Reichardt L.F. Rudkin B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38700-38708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Chow et al. (21Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) demonstrated that blocking internalization of the IGF-IR in Chinese hamster ovary cells inhibits ERK activation without affecting IGF-I-mediated Akt activation. Likewise blocking epidermal growth factor receptor internalization results in a decrease in ERK activation but an increase in protein kinase C activation (22Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Furthermore nerve growth factor-mediated survival of PC12 cells is associated with surface-localized TrkA via the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, whereas internalized, endosome-associated TrkA induces nerve growth factor-mediated differentiation of these cells via the ERK pathway (23Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that the activation of specific signal transduction pathways and consequent biological responses are mediated through the subcellular compartmentalization of receptor tyrosine kinases. In the present study we combined empirical studies and mathematical modeling to investigate how IGF-IR trafficking promotes and sustains phosphorylation of Akt in glial progenitor cells. We tested the hypothesis that internalization and recycling of the IGF-IR mediates sustained Akt phosphorylation. Our results show that internalization of the IGF-IR was associated with initial Akt phosphorylation; however, recycling but not de novo synthesis was required to sustain Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore IGF-IRs co-localized with established markers for the endosomal recycling compartment, including Rab11 and the transferrin receptor (TfR) in a ligand-dependent manner. Finally we used computational methods to analyze the dynamics of IGF-IR trafficking that are consistent with sustained Akt phosphorylation.

The antibodies to Rab11 and GSK-3β were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The glucose transporter 1 antibody was a generous gift from Ian Simpson (24Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Sulfo-NHS-biotin and ImmunoPure streptavidin were purchased from Pierce. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—The central glial (CG)-4 cell line, an immortalized glial progenitor that gives rise to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, was a generous gift from Lynn Hudson (National Institutes of Health) (25Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in N2S medium composed of 1) 66% N2B2 medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 supplemented with 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/ml d-biotin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, 5 ng/ml selenium, 50 μg/ml apotransferrin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), 2) 34% B104 conditioning medium, 3) 5 ng/ml FGF-2, and 4) 0.5% fetal bovine serum. CG-4 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 2.0 × 104 cells/cm2 in N2S medium. Prior to all experiments cells were serum-starved in N1A (N2B2 medium without insulin) for 2–4 h and subsequently treated with 1 nm IGF-I with and without pharmacological inhibitors at the following concentrations: 100 μm dansylcadaverine, 10 μm monensin, and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. For all inhibitor groups, cells were pretreated for 15 min. Western Blot Analysis—Following treatments, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, and total cell lysates were isolated in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma). Lysates were briefly sonicated on ice and quantified by a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Approximately 20 μg of protein from each sample was boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% minigels (Invitrogen), and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05 or 0.1% Tween for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies overnight (1:1000; except cyclin D1, which was used at 1:250) at 4 °C in blocking buffer with gentle rocking. Membranes were incubated with the appropriate goat anti-rabbit or -mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The detection of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were exposed on film (Eastman Kodak Co.) within a linear range and digitally captured and quantified by NIH Image 1.62. Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—After IGF-I/inhibitor treatments, cells were rinsed with PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated with 0.3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin for 1 h at 4 °C. Reactions were quenched with 100 mm glycine for 10 min to remove unreacted biotin. Cells were then scraped in ice-cold PBS (plus protease inhibitors), and the volume of each sample was adjusted to 500 μl. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). Cells were passed through a 23-gauge needle and incubated on ice for 30 min with constant rocking. Lysates were briefly sonicated, and an aliquot was taken for protein normalization. Samples were incubated with ImmunoPure streptavidin for 1 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rocking. Streptavidin-precipitated complexes were rinsed three times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and once in PBS. Biotinylated proteins were eluted with 2× SDS buffer and boiling. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot analysis (as described above) for surface and total IGF-IR subunit immunoreactivity. Endosome Separation—Procedures were performed as described previously (26Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly progenitor cells were homogenized in 0.5 ml of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose). Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate nuclei. Postnuclear supernatants were further clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The clarified supernatants were loaded onto a 10–50% linear sucrose gradient (4.5 ml) and centrifuged for 16 h in an SW 55Ti rotor at 48,000 rpm at 4 °C. Eight (0.6-ml) fractions were collected from the top of each gradient. Protein was precipitated overnight with 2 volumes of ice-cold ethanol at -20 °C and resuspended in SDS buffer. Organelle Immunoisolation—Cells were incubated with sulfo-NHS-biotin, as described above for the biotinylation assay, to eliminate surface proteins. Subsequently TfR-positive endosomes were isolated with Dynabead M-500 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly a mouse anti-human transferrin receptor antibody was incubated with surface protein-cleared homogenates overnight and next incubated with sheep anti-mouse Dynal magnetic beads for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rocking. Immunoisolated endosomes were eluted from beads with SDS buffer and boiling. Mathematical Analyses—Mathematical models of the experimental data were constructed as systems of ordinary differential equations in which each equation of the system corresponds to an identifiable biological state of the IGF-IR or Akt. The IGF-IR states were represented as the fractional occupancy of each state (i.e. the states sum to 1.0). Simple rate parameters, fitted by hand, govern the transitions between states of the IGF-IR or activation of Akt. The transitions do not directly correspond to biological transition/activation kinetics but instead represent several distinct steps collapsed together. The models used here are “minimal models” representing the simplest description that is consistent with the experimental data. The models were coded in MATLAB® Version 7.0.4 and solved using the ode23s routine. The four-state model (see “Results” for a description of states and Table 1 for rate constants) is as follows. dRM1dt=−kM1M2RM1+kM2M1RM2+kI2M1RI2 dRM2dt=kM1M2RM1−kM2M1RM2−kM2I1RM2 dRI1dt=kM2I1RM2−kI1I2RI1 dRI2dt=kI1I2RI1−kI2M1RI2 dAktdt=kAaRI1−kAdAktTABLE 1Four-state model rate constants Receptor states are in arbitrary units, representing fractional occupancy of the total receptor states (which sum to 1.0); time is in minutes.

For all experiments, one way analysis of variance followed by a Fisher’s posthoc test was used to assess the statistical significance between treatment groups. All experiments were repeated at least three times. IGF-I Is Required for Sustained IGF-IR and Akt Phosphorylation—Previously we demonstrated that IGF-I promotes the survival and long term protection of primary rat oligoden-drocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from trophic factor deprivation and glutamate-mediated toxicity through sustained phosphorylation of Akt (2Ness J.K. Wood T.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Ness J.K. Mitchell N.E. Wood T.L. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 24: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 4Ness J.K. Scaduto Jr., R.C. Wood T.L. Glia. 2004; 46: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilized the CG-4 cell line of rat OPCs to better understand the mechanisms by which the IGF-IR mediates sustained Akt phosphorylation (27Ranjan M. Hudson L.D. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To verify that IGF-I activates its receptor similarly in primary and CG-4 progenitors, we treated CG-4 cells with IGF-I or basal medium for 24 h (Fig. 1). Similar to our previous results in primary OPCs, phosphorylation of the IGF-IRβ subunit in IGF-I-treated cells though 24 h was significant over t0 and control groups (p = 0.01; Fig. 1, A and B). No changes in total IGF-IR protein levels were observed (Fig. 1, A and C). To determine whether IGF-I sustains Akt phosphorylation in CG-4 progenitors and whether the presence of IGF-I is required for the sustained phosphorylation of Akt, CG-4 progenitors were stimulated with IGF-I for 24 h or for 30 min and then incubated in basal medium without IGF-I for 24 h. In the continual presence of IGF-I, Akt phosphorylation was sustained through 24 h (p < 0.05; Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with our previous results in primary OPCs (3Ness J.K. Mitchell N.E. Wood T.L. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 24: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, removal of IGF-I after 30 min of stimulation resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Akt to control (t0) levels within 30 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Similarly the phosphorylation of GSK-3β, a direct downstream substrate of Akt and indicator of Akt activity, was also sustained through 24 h in the presence of IGF-I (p < 0.05) and was markedly decreased after IGF-I removal to control (t0) levels (Fig. 2, A and C). The results demonstrating that the continual presence of ligand is required to sustain Akt phosphorylation indicate that the localization of the IGF-IR at the cell surface also is required. In addition, these experiments demonstrate that the kinetics of IGF-I stimulation of its receptor and downstream targets are similar in CG-4 and primary OPCs. Therefore, we utilized the CG-4 progenitor cell line in the subsequent experiments to elucidate the mechanisms of IGF-IR-mediated sustained Akt phosphorylation. IGF-I Stimulation Alters the Surface Availability of the IGF-IR—Whereas total levels of IGF-IR protein remained unchanged during IGF-I treatment in these and our previous studies (2Ness J.K. Wood T.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Ness J.K. Mitchell N.E. Wood T.L. Dev. Neurosci. 2002; 24: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining whether surface localization of the IGF-IR was altered by ligand stimulation. Using a biotinylation assay, we measured IGF-IR availability at the cell surface following IGF-I stimulation. Progenitor cells were serum-starved for 120 min and then treated with IGF-I or basal medium (N1A) from 0 to 120 min. Surface IGF-IRs were quantified following cell surface biotinylation and streptavidin precipitation. The IGF-IR was constitutively present at the cell surface in control cells in basal medium through 60 min. However, prolonged absence of IGF-I (4 h) induced an approximate 80% increase in surface IGF-IRs (p < 0.005; Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, IGF-I stimulation decreased IGF-IR surface availability by 32% after 15 min (p < 0.04; Fig. 3, A and B) and 86% after 30 min (p < 0.04; Fig. 3, A and B) compared with t0. The decrease in surface IGF-IR was followed by recovery to 36% after 60 min (p < 0.002; Fig. 3, A and B) and 90% after 120 min (Fig. 3, A and B). Cells treated with IGF-I, without prior sulfo-NHS-biotin incubation, were negative for surface IGF-IRβ subunit immunoreactivity (data not shown). These data suggest that the IGF-IR is internalized and subsequently recovers at the cell surface following stimulation with IGF-I. Moreover the data suggest that growth factor-deprived cells are sensitized to IGF-I through the up-regulation of surface IGF-IRs. Dansylcadaverine Blocks IGF-IR Internalization and Akt Phosphorylation—To confirm that the loss of surface IGF-IR after IGF-I stimulation is due to receptor internalization and to examine the relationship between Akt phosphorylation and surface availability of the IGF-IR, we treated cells with dansylcadaverine, a pharmacological inhibitor of transglutaminase activity and receptor internalization (28Levitzki A. Willingham M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2706-2710Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Dansylcadaverine was used previously to block IGF-IR internalization in Chinese hamster ovary cells (21Chow J.C. Condorelli G. Smith R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4672-4680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and in mouse embryo fibroblasts (29Vecchione A. Marchese A. Henry P. Rotin D. Morrione A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3363-3372Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). CG-4 progenitors were treated with IGF-I with or without dansylcadaverine for 30 min, the time when we observed maximal loss of surface IGF-IR following IGF-I exposure (see Fig. 3). As in previous experiments, IGF-IR surface availability was markedly decreased after 30 min of IGF-I stimulation (p < 0.05; Fig. 4, A and B). However, in the presence of dansylcadaverine, receptor surface availability remained at the level of the untreated control (t0) cells (Fig. 4, A and B). IGF-IR phosphorylation was equivalent in cells treated with IGF-I plus dansylcadaverine compared with cells treated with only IGF-I (p < 0.005 versus t0; Fig. 4, A and C). To determine whether dansylcadaverine altered IGF-IR-mediated Akt phosphorylation, progenitors were treated with IGF-I plus or minus dansylcadaverine for 5, 20, and 30 min. The presence of dansylcadaverine blocked IGF-I-mediated Akt phosphorylation at all time points versus cells treated with IGF-I alone (p < 0.0001 versus t0; Fig. 4, D and E). The results of these experiments demonstrate that dansylcadaverine blocks internalization of the IGF-IR as well as IGF-I-mediated Akt phosphorylation without affecting IGF-IR phosphorylation. Recycling Is Required for IGF-IR Surface Recovery and Sustained Akt Phosphorylation—Our biotinylation data showed that IGF-IRs recover at the cell surface after 120 min of IGF-I stimulation (see Fig. 3). These receptors could originate either from recycling or from de novo synthesis of IGF-IRs. To investigate the role of recycling in surface recovery of the IGF-IR and sustained phosphorylation of Akt, we utilized the pharmacological inhibitor monensin, which blocks acidification of endosomal vesicles and consequently prevents trafficking to the lysosome and recycling compartment (30Yamashiro D.J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 26: 231-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Monensin was used in previous studies to block IGF-IR and insulin receptor endosomal trafficking in rat hippocampal neurons (31Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using the surface biotinylation assay, we again observed loss and recovery of surface IGF-IR at 30 and 120 min of IGF-I treatment, respectively (p < 0.03 versus t0; Fig. 5, A and B). However, the presence of monensin prevented receptor recovery at 120 min (p < 0.03; Fig. 5, A and B). To determine the effects of monensin on Akt phosphorylation, progenitors were treated with IGF-I plus or minus monensin for 15 or 120 min. The phosphorylation of Akt in IGF-I-treated cells at 15 min (p < 0.03) and 120 min (p < 0.0001) was significant over control groups. However, the presence of monensin significantly blocked Akt phosphorylation at 120 min compared with cells treated with IGF-I alone at 120 min (p < 0.0003; Fig. 5, C and D). Monensin had no effect on Akt phosphorylation at 15 min. The previous data suggest that IGF-IR recycling contributes to recovery of the receptor at the cell surface after exposure to IGF-I; however, it does not preclude an additional contribution from synthesis of new receptors. Although total IGF-IR levels appear stable through 24 h (see Fig. 1), this could be the result of steady-state kinetics of receptor synthesis and degradation. To determine whether de novo synthesis of the IGF-IR contributes to the IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Akt, cells were treated with IGF-I plus or minus cycloheximide pretreatment to block protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of Akt in IGF-I-treated cells was significantly above that in control cells in the presence and absence of cycloheximide (p < 0.0001 versus t0; Fig. 6, A and B). Cycloheximide had no effect on total IGF-IR protein levels (Fig. 6, A and C). Analysis of cyclin D1 as a positive control for cycloheximide activity revealed decreased cyclin D1 protein levels in the same cells treated with cycloheximide (p < 0.0001"

The emergence of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotic therapy is a major public health threat (1Lowy F.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Of particular concern is Staphylococcus aureus, because this Gram-positive pathogen is the leading cause of infections in the bloodstream, lower respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue in the United States (2Diekema D.J. Pfaller M.A. Schmitz F.J. Smayevsky J. Bell J. Jones R.N. Beach M. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001; 32 (–S132): S114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). S. aureus strains exhibiting resistance against multiple antibiotics, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, are isolated in 30–60% of community and >80% of hospital infections with this pathogen (3Kaplan S.L. Hulten K.G. Gonzalez B.E. Hammerman W.A. Lamberth L. Versalovic J. Mason E.O.J. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2005; 40: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Vancomycin or other glycopeptides are considered last-resort therapies for methicillin-resistant S. aureus; however, S. aureus strains with intermediate or full resistance to vancomycin can cause infections for which antimicrobial treatment may no longer be effective (4Chang S. Sievert D.M. Hageman J.C. Boulton M.L. Tenover F.C. Downes F.P. Shah S. Rudrik J.T. Pupp G.R. Brown W.J. Cardo D. Fridkin S.K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1342-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Surface proteins of Gram-positive bacteria play important roles during pathogenesis (5Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sortases anchor these polypeptides to the bacterial cell wall envelope (6Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). For example, S. aureus sortase A recognizes proteins destined for the cell surface via an LPXTG motif in their C-terminal sorting signal (7Schneewind O. Mihaylova-Petkov D. Model P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Following cleavage between the threonine and the glycine residues, an acyl-enzyme intermediate captures cleaved substrate at the active site thiol of sortase (8Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Nucleophilic attack of the amino group of the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II (C55-PP-MurNAc-(l-Ala-d-iGln-l-Lys(NH2-Gly5)-d-Ala-d-Ala)-GlcNAc) at the thioester intermediate resolves the acyl enzyme and forms an amide bond between the C-terminal threonine of surface protein and pentaglycine crossbridges (9Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Lipid II-linked polypeptide is subsequently incorporated into the cell wall envelope of staphylococci (10Ton-That H. Labischinski H. Berger-Bachi B. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29143-29149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The final product of this pathway, protein linked to cell wall pentaglycine cross-bridges, is displayed on the bacterial surface and enables interactions between the pathogen and tissues of its host. Surface protein anchoring to the cell wall envelope is thought to be an essential strategy for bacterial survival during infection, because mutants lacking genes for one or more sortase enzymes are attenuated in virulence (11Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Jensen E.R. Lenoy E. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5510-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Inhibition of sortases by small molecules may therefore function as a therapeutic strategy for bacterial infections.

However, most of these compounds are either of low activity, lack specificity, or display undesirable structural features that confound therapeutic use. To overcome these obstacles, we have screened a library of small molecules and identified aryl (β-amino)ethyl ketones as mechanism-based inactivators of sortases. Bacterial Strains and Reagents—S. aureus sortase A (SrtA), 2The abbreviations used are: SrtA, sortase A; SrtB, sortase B; SrtC, sortase C; AAEK, aryl (β-amino)ethyl ketone; DTT, dithiothreitol; SAR, structure-activity relationship; HTS, high-throughput screen; NSRB, National Screening Laboratory for the Regional Centers of Excellence in Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; a-LPETG-d, 2-aminobenzoyl-LPETG-diaminopropionic acid-dinitrophenyl-NH2; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Bacillus anthracis sortase A, SrtB, and SrtC were purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography (8Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. Compounds AAEK1 (5927860) and AAEK2 (5927943) were purchased from Chembridge (San Diego, CA), and their structures were validated by 1H NMR and liquid chromatography-MS. Identification of Sortase Inhibitors—The NSRB at Harvard Medical School provided compound libraries for sortase inhibitor studies. Purified S. aureus SrtA (2 μm) in black polystyrene 384-well plates was incubated with 1 μl of test compound (10 ng) in Me2SO for 1 h at 25°C, followed by addition of 2-aminobenzoyl-LPETG-diaminopropionic acid-dinitrophenyl-NH2 (a-LPETG-d)to2 μm in 50 μl of reaction buffer (5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl2,50mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and further incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured using an Envision plate reader (excitation λ = 320 nm, emission λ = 420 nm, Fig. 1A, inset). This assay yielded a Z′ of 0.94 (22Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5269) Google Scholar). Sixteen wells of positive control (no compounds added) and sixteen of negative control (no compound or sortase added) wells were performed per plate. Final Me2SO concentrations were ≤2.5% (v/v), a concentration shown to have no effect on control fluorescence levels (data not shown). Data Analysis and Hit Selection—Data were qualified for analysis by evaluation of within- and across-plate biases and other systematic errors using Spotfire Decision® (SpotFire U.S., Somerville, MA). Percent activities (%A, the ratio of fluorescence from a test compound well to the plate positive control mean, multiplied by 100) and percent inhibition (%I = 100–%A) were computed. Compounds were rank ordered according to %I. 6,154 compounds (4.5% of initial libraries) were active and displayed %I ≥ 20 (Fig. 1B). Structures of hit compounds were examined using custom sub-structure search routines in SARNavigator® 1.2 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO) to “filter” reactive and promiscuous inhibitors (23Rishton G.M. Drug.

The alert molecules were separated into a salvage set, generating a set of 2,023 compounds (1.5% of initial) that were assigned lead-like activities. Analysis of these compounds for structural similarity based on computed Tanimoto distances (SARNavigator or Accord® 6.1, Accelrys, San Diego, CA (31Perez J.J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2005; 34: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) was followed by visual inspection to identify “clean” lead-like clusters and singletons (a molecule/chemotype without a second example) (26Martin Y.C. 232nd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society. 2006; (, Abstract MEDI-313, American Chemical Society, San Francisco, CA)Google Scholar, 31Perez J.J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2005; 34: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These clusters were sampled with emphasis on compounds with %I ≥ 50 and potential for providing SAR in subsequent studies. Analysis of these for structural similarity identified >80 clusters with >1150 molecules (median size, 3; mean, 14; and range, 2–63) and >850 putative singletons. Approximately 210 clean compounds were selected for secondary assays. The alerts salvage set was combined with the singletons and other weakly active clean molecules, and this combined set was clustered and examined visually. Clusters were again sampled on the basis of activity, properties, and potential to provide SAR, and the best representatives and the most active and lead-like singletons were then added to the 210 to yield a final set of 407 compounds with potential both as research tools and as therapeutic candidates. These 407 compounds were subjected to a secondary screen using B. anthracis SrtA and papain and data analyzed as described for HTS of S. aureus SrtA. IC50 Determination—S. aureus and B. anthracis sortases (8 μm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of either AAEK1 or AAEK2 (0.01–3200 μm)for 1 h at 37°C, followed by addition of a-LPETG-d (SrtA), a-KTDNPKTGDEA-d (SrtB), or a-GEKLPNTASNN-d (SrtC) in 300 μl of reaction buffer for 15 min at 37 °C, and fluorescence was quantified as described above. IC50 values were determined by fitting data to a default four parameter variable slope sigmoidal function in GraphPad Prism® 4.0c using a nonlinear least squares algorithm. Michaelis-Menten Kinetics—S. aureus SrtA (4 μm) was incubated with or without AAEK1 (50 μm) or AAEK2 (200 μm) in the presence of various concentrations of substrate (a-LPETG-d, 0–68 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer and 300-μl volume, followed by fluorescence measurements. Kinetic constants were determined by Lineweaver-Burke analysis. The amount of cleaved substrate was <5% for all velocity determinations. For dialysis experiments, S. aureus SrtA (4 μm) was incubated with or without AAEK1 or AAEK2 (0.8 mm) for 2 h at 25 °C, followed by dialysis against 1 liter of reaction buffer for 24 h at 4 °C. Substrate (8 μm a-LPETG-d) was added, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, followed by fluorescence measurements. MS of Sortase-Inhibitor Complexes—Wild-type or C184A S. aureus SrtA (10 μm) was incubated with or without AAEK1 (800 μm)at25°C for 1 h in reaction buffer. Trypsin (5 μg) was added, and sortase inhibitor complexes were digested at 37 °C for 12 h. Reaction aliquots (500 μl) were subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on C18 column (2 × 250 mm, C18). Cleaved peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (100 min, 0.5 ml min–1 fractions collected). Peak fractions (Abs.215) were dried, dissolved in 15 μl of 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid mixed with saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid suspensions, spotted onto sample plates, and airdried. For MALDI-TOF experiments, samples were ionized with an N2 UV laser in a Reflectron time-of-flight spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in reflectron mode. Two hundred laser shots were conducted at an accelerating voltage of 25,000 V and laser intensity of 2,075 (repetition rate, 3 Hz). The instrument was calibrated using bovine serum albumin as an internal standard control, and scans were processed using Biosystems Voyager 6004 software. Peptides with m/z 1555.74 and m/z 1693.78 were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry. Synthesis of Olefin Intermediates—Inhibition intermediate 12,an α,β-unsaturated olefin, was prepared in two steps from commercial thiophene-2-carbaldehyde by procedures summarized here. The comparable 1-(thiophen-3-yl) products were prepared from their corresponding aryl aldehydes. Chromatographically pure products were isolated by Still-type isocratic 60-Å SiO2 adsorption chromatography at medium pressure (0.7 MPa, Biotage SP1™ system, KP-SIL™, 40–63 μm), using 3–15% linear gradients of EtOAc in hexanes with 2- to 4-column volume initial and final isocratic steps. Subsequent spectroscopic data, pulsed Fourier transform 1H and 13C NMR, electrospray ionization-MS, and Fourier transform IR, were consistent with the structures reported and literature data available. Purified products were stored under argon at –20 °C in the dark until use. rac-1-(Thiophen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-ol (11) (32Morrill C. Beutner G.L. Grubbs R.H. J. Org. Chem. 2006; 71 (, and Suppl. Inf. I, p. S10): 7813-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was prepared from vacuum-distilled thiophene-2-carbaldehyde by treatment with 1.10–1.20 equivalents of vinylmagnesium chloride in anhydrous Fluka tetrahydrofuran at 15–20 °C for 3–4 h (reaction 0.7 m in aldehyde, scale 3.4–15 mmol) (33Trost B.M. Fraisse P.L. Ball Z.T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2002; 114 (, and Suppl. Inf. I, p. 34): 1101-1103Crossref Google Scholar). After weakly acidic aqueous workup, tert-butylmethyl ether extraction, and standard drying, chromatographic isolation gave the indicated pure product (yields, 74–92%). 1-(Thiophen-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (12) (34Kang S.K. Ho P.S. Yoon S.K. Lee J.C. Lee K.J. Synthesis. 1998; 1998: 823-825Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was prepared from purified 11 or directly from the crude propenol extract of 11 after drying. The extract was treated with 1.50 equivalent of the oxidant N-methylmorpholine N-oxide and 0.15 equivalent of the Fluka catalyst tetra-N-propylammonium perruthenate in anhydrous Fluka dichloromethane at 0–5 °C for 15–17 h (reaction 0.10 m in alcohol, scale 0.6–1.8 mmol) (35Ali A. Thompson C.F. Balkovec J.M. Graham D.W. Hammond M.L. Quraishi N. Tata J.R. Einstein M. Ge L. Harris G. Kelly T.M. Mazur P. Pandit S. Santoro J. Sitlani A. Wang C. Williamson J. Miller D.K. Thompson C.M. Zaller D.M. Forrest M.J. Carballo-Jane E. Luell S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 2441-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After catalyst adsorption/filtration (ICN GmbH SiliTech SiO2, 32–63 μm/Celite 545®), filtrate evaporation, and extraction of the residue with hexanes, chromatographic isolation gave the indicated pure product (yields: 59% on 63% conversion from pure 11, 24% direct from extract). Compounds were diluted to 0.57–0.58 m in 50% aqueous Me2SO containing sortase reaction buffer (see above). Compounds were further diluted to assay concentrations of 5 or 50 μm, and assays were performed as described for the DTT experiments. Effect of DTT on AAEK1- and AAEK2-mediated Inhibition of Sortase—Reactions included 4 μm S. aureus SrtA, 8 μm a-LPETG-d, inhibitor (50 μm AAEK1 or 200 μm AAEK2), and increasing concentrations of DTT (2–500 μm) and were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by fluorescence measurements. Crystallography—Protein expression and purification was carried out as described (36Zhang R. Wu R. Joachimiak G. Mazmanian S.K. Missiakas D.M. Gornicki P. Schneewind O. Joachimiak A. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The construct did not include 36 N-terminal amino acids (signal peptide) and encoded a 242-amino acid SrtB polypeptide with a 24-residue His tag at its N terminus. A 2 mm protein stock solution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT was used for crystallization. Selenomethionine-labeled SrtB was prepared using the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method (37Walsh M.A. Dementieva I. Evans G. Sanishvili R. Joachimiak A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were diluted to 10 and 50 mm in crystallization buffer for AAEK1 and AAEK2, respectively. The SrtB/AAEK adduct structures were obtained using vapor diffusion at 25 °C and crystallized under different conditions as compared with apo-protein. The SrtB/AAEK1 adduct crystallizes in a different space group (see Table 3). The structures of SrtB/AAEK1 and SrtB/AAEK2 adducts were determined by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using HKL3000 (38Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar) and selenomethionine-labeled enzyme. The structures were auto traced using ARP/wARP and refined with REFMAC against the averaged peak data (39Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The initial models of SrtB/AAEK1 and SrtB/AAEK2 were adjusted manually using COOT and refined to the final crystallographic R of 18.7% and Rfree of 25.9% for SrtB/AAEK1, and to the final crystallographic R of 18.6% and Rfree of 22.6% for SrtB/AAEK2, both with zero σ cutoff (see Table 3). The stereochemistry of the structures was examined with PROCHECK and the Ramachandran plot. The final model of SrtB/AAEK1 does not have sufficient density for nine N-terminal residues (64–65 and 85–191) and four internal residues (238–241). The final model of SrtB/AAEK2 does not have sufficient density for four internal residues (236–240). Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank.TABLE 3SrtB-AAEK adducts Summary of crystal, data collection, and crystallographic statistics for complexes with AAEK1 and AAEK2. Open table in a new tab Screening for Sortase Inhibitors—A biochemical assay that monitors S. aureus sortase A cleavage of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate (a-LPETG-d) between the threonine and glycine residues was optimized for HTS (8Ton-That H.

Translation of this assay into a 384-well format yielded a Z′ of 0.94, which is well above the value suggested for successful HTS assays (Fig. 1A) (22Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5269) Google Scholar). Using the NSRB library, 135,625 small molecules were screened in duplicate for inhibition of SrtA (Fig. 1A, inset). Of the compounds assayed, 6,154 displayed percent inhibitions (%I) >20% (Fig. 1B). Of these, ∼two-thirds were placed in a salvage set for being reactive, genotoxic, promiscuous (frequent hits in unrelated assays), or lacking in drug-like properties (see “Experimental Procedures”) (23Rishton G.M. Drug. Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24Seidler J. McGovern S.L. Doman T.N. Shoichet B.K. J. Med.

The remaining lead-like activities were clustered on the basis of structure to identify common structural cores (chemotypes) and selected based on SARs. After combining these with the most active compounds from the salvage set, a total of 407 compounds was attained (Fig. 1B). To examine specificity of inhibition, the 407 compounds were screened for inhibition of B. anthracis SrtA and papain, a eukaryotic protease with an active site thiol (40Zong Y. Bice T.W. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Narayana S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31383-31389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Many of the most potent and specific sortase inhibitors belonged to five chemotypes (Table 1): Class I, aryl (β-amino)ethyl ketones; Class II, N-aryl maleamides and aryl fumaramides, and related compounds; Class III, N,4-diaryl-2-aminothiazoles; Class IV, 3-heteroatom-substituted (N-alkyl/aryl)pyrrolidine-2,5-diones; and Class V, variously substituted maleimide-furan Diels-Alder products. Of these, the aryl (β-amino)ethyl ketones (AAEK) were the most active inhibitors of sortases from staphylococci and bacilli (Table 1). These compounds are Mannich bases (41Tramontini M. Angiolini L. Tetrahedron. 1990; 46: 1791-1837Crossref Scopus (430) Google Scholar), with a propiophenone (or related heteroaromatic) core, bearing a β-arylamino or β-dialkylamino substituent. Two compounds, AAEK1 and AAEK2, were selected for further characterization because of their substantial inhibition of sortase, limited inhibition of papain, and presentation of heavy atoms to assist in eventual x-ray structure determination (Table 2).TABLE 1Representative classes of sortase inhibitors revealed by HTS Shown are the core structures of five chemotypes of sortase inhibitors with a cluster size ≥6 that demonstrate limited inhibition of papain. The range of percent inhibitions observed for the class and the median (brackets) are shown for sortase A (S. aureus and B. anthracis) and papain (C. papaya). R, R′, and R″ indicate a hydrogen atom or an alkyl-type substituent (alkyl, methylene, or methine); Ar indicates a carbocyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic, including complex arrays; X indicates a heteroatom functional group such as OR, -NHR, etc.; and a dashed line indicates the presence/absence of a ring unsaturation. Open table in a new tab TABLE 2The structures of ten representatives from the AAEK chemotype class The mean percent inhibitions of sortase A (S. aureus and B. anthracis) and papain (C. papaya) are presented. Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Sortases by AAEKs—Inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of AAEK1 and AAEK2 for sortases from B. anthracis and S. aureus were determined. AAEK1 and AAEK2 were ∼10- and 3-fold more potent inhibitors of B. anthracis SrtA than of S. aureus SrtA (Fig. 2, A and B). Inhibition of B. anthracis SrtA was severalfold greater than inhibition of SrtB or SrtC (Fig. 2, B–D). As different sortase enzymes recognize unique substrates, it seems plausible that observed differences in IC50 values may be due to differences in active site configuration for members of this enzyme family. Nevertheless, the data suggest that AAEK1 and AAEK2 function as inhibitors of all four sortases tested. Incubation of S. aureus SrtA in the presence of inhibitor (AAEK1 or AAEK2) with increasing concentrations of peptide substrate caused no alterations in Km but decreased Vmax with an apparent non-competitive profile (supplemental Fig. S1A). Lineweaver-Burke transformation of the data corroborated this notion, revealing Vmax values of 88.8 ± 7.8 (AAEK1) and 58.0 ± 3.6 (AAEK2) compared with 139.0 ± 5.4 observed in the absence of inhibitor (supplemental Table S1). Following a 2-h incubation of SrtA with AAEK1 or AAEK2, reactions were subjected to dialysis and then assayed for activity. Dialysis failed to restore activity, consistent with the notion that these compounds cause irreversible inhibition of sortases even in the absence of substrate (supplemental Fig. S1B). If so, AAEK-mediated inhibition likely precedes enzyme nucleophilic attack at the scissile peptide bond. Inhibition by AAEKs Occurs at the Active Site Thiol of Sortase—S. aureus sortase A was incubated with or without AAEK1. Enzyme preparations were subjected to tryptic digestion, peptides separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and fractions yielding absorbance at 215 nm were analyzed by mass spectrometry. A compound with m/z 1555.74 eluted in fraction 50, and its mass measurement was in agreement with the predicted m/z 1555.73 of the tryptic peptide QLTLITCDDYNEK, encompassing the active site residue Cys-184 (Fig. 3A). MS/MS of m/z 1555.74 confirmed the peptide sequence QLTLITCDDYNEK (supplemental Table S2). MS failed to identify a compound with m/z 1555.74 in sortase preparations that had been incubated with AAEK1 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, m/z of 1693.78 was present in sortase preparations (fraction 54) that had been treated with AAEK1 but not in sortase preparations without inhibitor (Fig. 3, C and D). MS/MS of m/z 1693.78 confirmed the peptide sequence QLTLITXDDYNEK (supplemental Table S2), where X represents Cys-184, which has been chemically modified by the inhibitor and is in agreement with the addition of a thienylpropanone moiety (Fig. 3C, inset, supplemental Table S3). If so, the amine moiety of AAEK1 must first be eliminated in order for the compound to react with thiol in the active site of sortase. The modification did not occur when AAEK1 was incubated with a mutant enzyme carrying an alanine substitution at the active site residue (C184A). Thus, modification of sortase with"
https://openalex.org/W2028826941,"Different strategies proposed as therapy for Alzheimer disease (AD) have aimed to reduce the level of toxic forms of A beta peptide in the brain. Here, we directly analyze the therapeutic utility of the polyclonal anti-A beta(1-11) antibody induced in 3xTg-AD mice vaccinated with the second generation prototype epitope vaccine. Substoichiometric concentrations of purified anti-A beta(1-11) antibody prevented aggregation of A beta(42) and induced disaggregation of preformed A beta(42) fibrils down to nonfilamentous and nontoxic species. Anti-A beta(1-11) antibody delayed A beta(42) oligomer formation but ultimately appeared to stabilize nonfibrillar conformations, including oligomer-like assemblies. The reduced oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity observed upon preincubation of A beta oligomers with the anti-A beta(1-11) antibody in the absence of oligomer disaggregation suggests a possible oligomer rearrangement in the presence of the antibody. These in vitro observations suggest that preventive vaccination may protect from AD or may delay the onset of the disease, whereas therapeutic vaccination cannot disrupt the toxic oligomers and may only minimally alleviate preexisting AD pathology."

Binding of Mg2+ in EF-hands 2 and 3 was essential for RetGC activation in the conditions mimicking light adaptation. Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 2 affected the conformation of a neighboring non-metal binding domain, EF-hand-1, and increased GCAP-1 affinity for RetGC nearly 40-fold compared with the metal-free EF-hand 2. Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 3 increased GCAP-1 affinity for RetGC 5-fold and its maximal RetGC stimulation 2-fold. Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 4 affected neither GCAP-1 affinity for RetGC, nor RetGC activation. Inactivation of Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 4 was sufficient to render GCAP-1 a constitutive activator of RetGC, whereas the EF-hand 3 role in Ca2+-dependent deceleration of RetGC was likely to be through the neighboring EF-hand 4. Inactivation of Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 2 affected cooperativity of RetGC inhibition by Ca2+, but did not prevent the inhibition. We conclude that 1) Mg2+ binding in EF-hands 2 and 3, but not EF-hand 4, is essential for the ability of GCAP-1 to activate RetGC in the light; 2) Mg2+ or Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 3 and especially in EF-hand 2 is required for high-affinity interaction with the cyclase and affects the conformation of the neighboring EF-hand 1, a domain required for targeting RetGC; and 3) RetGC inhibition is likely to be primarily caused by Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 4. Guanylyl cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP-1), a Ca2+/Mg2+ sensor protein that accelerates retinal guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in the light and decelerates it in the dark, is inactive in cation-free form. Binding of Mg2+ in EF-hands 2 and 3 was essential for RetGC activation in the conditions mimicking light adaptation. Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 2 affected the conformation of a neighboring non-metal binding domain, EF-hand-1, and increased GCAP-1 affinity for RetGC nearly 40-fold compared with the metal-free EF-hand 2. Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 3 increased GCAP-1 affinity for RetGC 5-fold and its maximal RetGC stimulation 2-fold. Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 4 affected neither GCAP-1 affinity for RetGC, nor RetGC activation. Inactivation of Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 4 was sufficient to render GCAP-1 a constitutive activator of RetGC, whereas the EF-hand 3 role in Ca2+-dependent deceleration of RetGC was likely to be through the neighboring EF-hand 4. Inactivation of Ca2+ binding in EF-hand 2 affected cooperativity of RetGC inhibition by Ca2+, but did not prevent the inhibition.

Calcium is the major regulator of the physiological responses in photoreceptor cells. Calcium enters outer segments of vertebrate photoreceptors through cGMP-gated Na+/Ca2+ channels in the outer segment plasma membrane and is continuously removed from the outer segment by a light-independent Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger (for review, see Refs. 1Pugh Jr., E.N.

In the dark, cGMP keeps a small percentage of the Na+/Ca2+ channels open, and the hydrolysis of cGMP by a light-activated phosphodiesterase, PDE6, generates photoresponses in rods and cones. When light triggers cGMP hydrolysis, it also, through the closure of the channels, lowers the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ from near 250 nm in the dark to near 25 nm in the light (5Olshevskaya E.V.

GCAPs become RetGC activators at low Ca2+ concentrations and inhibit it at high Ca2+, such that when the Ca2+ concentration drops upon the illumination, GCAPs activate RetGC to quickly restore the level of cGMP in photoreceptors and thus accelerate their recovery from excitation. Conversely, when RetGC produces enough cGMP to reopen the Na+/Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ re-enters the outer segments and the Ca2+-bound GCAPs decelerate cGMP synthesis. GCAPs are recoverin-like neuronal calcium-binding proteins, also referred to as the neuronal calcium sensors (NCS) family, a part of a larger superfamily of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (12Palczewski K.

Like all other members of that superfamily GCAPs have Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains of the helix-loop-helix structure. The metal-binding loop in the NCS proteins is traditionally defined as 12 sequential amino acid residues, of which 6 residues provide the oxygen atoms required for the metal coordination, including the invariant first and the last coordinating residues, Asp and Glu, respectively. The N-terminal EF-hand domains in GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 lack some of the oxygen-containing groups required for coordinating the metal ion (17Babu A. Su H. Ryu Y. Gulati J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15469-15474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but are instead required for their interaction with RetGC (18Ermilov A.N. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol.

We previously found that in the conditions that mimic light-adapted or dark-adapted photoreceptors, three other EF-hands in GCAP-1 are predominantly filled by either Mg2+ or Ca2+, respectively (21Peshenko I.V.

Among these are the observations that inactivation of all three metal-binding EF-hands in GCAP-2 by substitution of the last Glu in EF-hands 2 and 3 with Gln and the first Asp in the EF-hand 4 with Asn make GCAP-2 a constitutive, insensitive to Ca2+ activator of RetGC (24Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19346-19350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed for GCAP-1, whose EF-hands were disabled by substitution of the last Glu in the Ca2+-binding loop with Asp (25Rudnicka-Nawrot M. Surgucheva I. Hulmes J.D. Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Crabb J.W. Baehr W. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Those observations lead to the perception that metal-free GCAPs are the activators of RetGC and that GCAPs undergo transition from Ca2+-bound to the metal-free form between dark and light. However, our recent study of metal-binding properties of GCAPs has also indicated that preventing Mg2+ binding in GCAP-1 hampers stimulation of RetGC-1 (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We concluded from the previous study (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that, because cation binding was not only required for inhibition of RetGC, but was also critical for RetGC activation under physiological conditions, the general view on the functioning of GCAPs as metal-binding proteins in RetGC regulation needed to be revised (5Olshevskaya E.V. Calvert P.D. Woodruff M.L. Peshenko I.V. Savchenko A.B. Makino C.L. Ho Y.S. Fain G.L. Dizhoor A.M. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6078-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Woodruff M.L.

Therefore, the functions of the specific EF-hands in GCAPs must be revisited to provide more adequate understanding of their role in RetGC regulation via Ca2+/Mg2+ exchange. The main purpose of this study was to determine the role of cation binding by EF-hands 2, 3, and 4 in GCAP-1 in creating its “activator” state, such as in the light-adapted photoreceptors. Recombinant GCAP-1 and Its Mutants—All mutations were incorporated into bovine GCAP-1 cDNA by PCR using a “splicing by overlap extension” technique (27Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). Wild type GCAP-1 and its mutants used in this study also carried a D6S substitution that creates a recognition site for the yeast N-myristoyl transferase (28Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P.

GCAP-1 cDNA was expressed under control of the isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-regulated T7 promoter in a BL21(DE3) pLysS Escherichia coli strain (Novagen/Calbiochem) harboring a pBB131 plasmid for a yeast N-myristoyl transferase expression as described (29Dizhoor A.M.

Free myristic acid was added from a concentrated ethanol solution to the suspension of bacterial cells to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml 20 min prior to the induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours after the induction, the bacterial pellet was harvested and the recombinant GCAPs were purified as described previously in detail (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The concentration of GCAP-1 and its mutants was determined in 20 mm Na-phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride using extinction coefficients at 280 nm computed for the individual mutants from their amino acid composition (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

Tryptophan Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission at 332 nm (excitation at 290 nm) was recorded at 23 °C using 4 μm GCAP-1 in 0.6 ml of 100 mm MOPS/KOH (pH 7.2), 40 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA. Small aliquots of concentrated MgCl2 solution were added to obtain the desired free Mg2+ concentrations. The free Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in solution were calculated according to the method of Brooks and Stoney (33Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal.

The data shown are representative from three to seven independent experiments producing virtually identical results. Mutations That Inhibit Cation Binding in EF-hands of GCAP-1 and May or May Not Result in Constitutive Activation of RetGC—In our previous study we found that disabling all three metal-binding EF-hands in GCAP-1 by mutations that nonselectively hampered both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding failed to produce a constitutive, Ca2+-insensitive activation of RetGC-1 (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). That was contrary to what one would expect if the apo form of the GCAP were the activator form and argued that the substitution of Ca2+ by Mg2+, rather than merely loss of Ca2+, was required to make GCAP-1 undergo the inhibitor-to-activator transition in the light. If this hypothesis were true, then to make GCAP-1 a constitutive activator of RetGC it should be made unable to bind Ca2+, yet still retain the ability to bind Mg2+ in its EF-hand(s). We found that the replacement of the last Glu in Ca2+-binding loops with Gln (Fig. 1) prevented binding of Ca2+, but had little effect on Mg2+ binding (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Predictably, EF(2,3,4)– mutant generated by such a substitution in all three metal-binding EF-hands, GCAP-1(E75Q/E111Q/E155Q), activated RetGC-1 at low Ca2+ and continued to activate it even at high concentrations of Ca2+, which turn wild type GCAP-1 into a RetGC-1 inhibitor (Fig. 2). Contrary to that, a different EF(2,3,4)– mutant, GCAP-1(D64N/D100N/D102G/D144N/D148G), which binds neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), failed to activate RetGC within the same free Ca2+ range (Fig. 2). Evidently, for GCAP-1 to become a RetGC-1 activator under the conditions typical for light-adapted photoreceptors one or more of its EF-hands must be filled with Mg2+.FIGURE 2The Ca2+ sensitivity of RetGC-1 regulation by wild type GCAP-1 and its EF(2,3,4)– mutants. Recombinant RetGC-1 was assayed at various free Ca2+ concentrations in the presence of 5 μm wild type GCAP-1 (○), E75Q/E111Q/E155Q GCAP-1 (▪), or D64N/D100N/D102G/D144N/D148G GCAP-1 (▴), at saturating 5 mm free Mg2+. The data for wild type GCAP-1 were fitted by the equation, A = (Amax – Amin)/(1 + ([Ca]f/[Ca]1/2)n) + Amin, where A is the activity of RetGC-1, Amax and Amin are the maximal and minimal activity of RetGC in the assay, respectively, [Ca]1/2 is the free Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal inhibition of RetGC-1 by GCAP, n is the cooperativity coefficient.

Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A substitution in EF-hand 2, D64N, that prevents both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was compared with the wild type and E75Q substitution, which selectively preserves Mg2+ binding (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Whereas the GCAP-1(E75Q) showed dose dependence (K1/2) and the maximal activity of RetGC-1 stimulated by GCAP-1 (Amax) similar to the wild type, disabling of Mg2+ binding dramatically reduced the apparent affinity of GCAP-1(D64N) for RetGC-1, but had little effect on the Amax (Fig. 3A, Table 1).TABLE 1Activation of RetGC-1 by EF-hand mutants of GCAP-1MutantsAmaxaAmax represents the maximal level of RetGC-1 activation by GCAP at low free Ca2+ in the presence of 5 mm free Mg2+ (mean ± S.D.).K1/2bK1/2 represents the concentration of GCAP required for half-maximal activation of RetGC-1 (mean ± S.D., n is the number of independent measurements).nmol cGMP/mg/minμmWild type24.1 ± 2.5 (n = 3)1.17 ± 0.1 (n = 3)EF(2)- D64N25.6 ± 4.2 (n = 3)58 ± 17 (n = 3) E75Q25.3 ± 2.5 (n = 3)1.56 ± 1.5 (n = 3)EF(3)- D100N/D102G12.6 ± 2.4 (n = 4)5.0 ± 1.5 (n = 4) E111Q26.8 ± 0.7 (n = 3)1.05 ± 0.04 (n = 3)EF(4)- D144N/D148G25.6 ± 1.1 (n = 3)1.3 ± 0.7 (n = 3) E155Q25 ± 0.3 (n = 3)0.6 ± 0.1 (n = 3)EF(2,3)- D64N/D100N/D102G7.5 ± 0.6 (n = 3)65 ± 22 (n = 3) E75Q/E111Q26.2 ± 1.9 (n = 3)1.5 ± 0.25 (n = 3)a Amax represents the maximal level of RetGC-1 activation by GCAP at low free Ca2+ in the presence of 5 mm free Mg2+ (mean ± S.D.).b K1/2 represents the concentration of GCAP required for half-maximal activation of RetGC-1 (mean ± S.D., n is the number of independent measurements). Open table in a new tab Disabling Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 3 by a double mutation, D100N/D102G (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), noticeably reduced both the apparent affinity of GCAP-1 for RetGC-1 and its maximal activation. Opposite to that, a substitution that preserves Mg2+ binding, E111Q, affected neither Amax nor K1/2 (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Unlike EF-hands 2 or 3, disabling Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 4 by a double substitution, D144N/D148G (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), had no effect on Amax or K1/2 (Fig. 3C, Table 1). These data strongly indicate that among the three metal-binding EF-hands of GCAP-1, binding of Mg2+ in EF-hands 2 and 3 is important for RetGC-1 activation, whereas Mg2+ in EF-hand 4 does not significantly contribute to creating the activator state of GCAP-1. Indeed, simultaneous disabling of Mg2+ binding in both EF-hands 2 and 3 in GCAP-1(D64N/D100N/D102G) diminished its Amax and K1/2 even stronger than in the individually disabled EF-hands (Fig. 3D, Table 1). Unlike that, a different EF(2,3)– mutant, E75Q/E111Q, that retained Mg2+ binding in EF-hands 2 and 3 (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) demonstrated Amax and K1/2 similar to the wild type (Fig. 3D, Table 1). However, because the value for K1/2 was difficult to determine more accurately due to the low activity of the mutant, we additionally verified that the GCAP-1(D64N/D100N/D102G) lost its ability to interact with RetGC-1 in a competition experiment, where RetGC-1 was activated by 3 μm wild type GCAP-1 at low free [Ca2+] in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GCAP-1(D64N/D100N/D102G) (Fig. 3E). Even at 20-fold excess of the GCAP-1(D64N/D100N/D102G) over the wild type we find no evidence for its interference with the activation of RetGC-1. We therefore conclude that once GCAP-1 is lacking Mg2+ binding in both EF-hands 2 and 3, it becomes unable to properly interact with RetGC-1. Mg2+ Binding in EF-hand 2 Affects Conformation of EF-hand-like Domain 1—Although both EF-hands 2 and 3 are involved in activation of RetGC-1 at low free Ca2+, it appeared that Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 2 was the most critical for GCAP-1 affinity for the cyclase. There is a significant conformational difference between the Mg2+-bound and metal-free GCAP-1 (21Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In particular, binding of Mg2+ by EF-hands 2 and 3 causes structural changes in EF1, an EF-hand-like domain that cannot bind metal ion but is required for interaction of GCAPs with RetGC (18Ermilov A.N. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48143-48148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Hwang J.Y. Schlesinger R. Koch K.W. Eur. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43361-43373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These changes can be monitored by a change in fluorescence of Trp21 located in the middle of the GCAP-1 EF1 domain (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because in addition to the Trp21 GCAP-1 contains two more Trp residues, Trp51 and Trp94, we replaced them with Phe and used the resultant GCAP-1(W51F/W94F) mutant (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as a template for creating two other mutants, GCAP-1(D64N/W51F/W94F) and GCAP-1(E75Q/W51F/W94F), both with additional mutations affecting EF-hand 2. Each contained a single Trp21 residue, but only the latter mutant was able to bind Mg2+ in EF-hand 2. The GCAP-1(W51F/W94F) exhibited a prominent Mg2+-dependent decrease in Trp21 fluorescence caused by conformational changes in the EF 1 domain (Fig. 4 and Ref. 22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with the GCAP-1(E75Q/W51F/W94F), whose EF-hand 2 was modified by the E75Q mutation that preserved Mg2+ binding (Fig. 4). Contrary to that, disabling Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 2 by the D64N substitution in GCAP-1(D64N/W51F/W94F) prevented decrease in the Trp21 fluorescence. These results suggest that Mg2+ binding in EF-hand 2 creates proper conformation of the neighboring EF-hand-like domain, known to be required for GCAPs interaction with RetGC-1 (18Ermilov A.N. Olshevskaya E.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48143-48148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Hwang J.Y. Schlesinger R. Koch K.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3785-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The exact reason why Trp21 fluorescence does not stay completely flat, but slightly increases in the D64N mutant is unknown, but one possible explanation can be that when EF-hand 2 is in its apo (non-physiological) form, cation binding to EF-hands 3 and/or 4, through conformational change in the rest of the molecule, affects the environment for Trp21 and thus produces the small increase in fluorescence. It is therefore only possible to see this effect when the EF-2 is inactivated and the rest of the Trp residues in the molecule are removed. In the presence of the functional EF-hand 2 the influence from the rest of the molecule on the environment of Trp21 is strongly opposed by cation binding in the neighboring EF-hand 2 that results in a decrease of fluorescence. Ca2+ Binding and Inhibition of RetGC—In photoreceptor cells, GCAP-1 undergoes transition between the Mg2+- and Ca2+-bound forms as the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ changes between light and dark (21Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16903-16906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a process that turns GCAP-1 from RetGC activator into RetGC inhibitor. The replacement of Mg2+ by Ca2+ occurs in all three EF-hands (22Peshenko I.V. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23830-23841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), however, it is still unclear how individual EF-hands of GCAP-1 contribute to its transition to the RetGC inhibitor form. Another group previously reported that disabling of Ca2+ binding in EF-hands 3 and 4 by substitution of the last Glu with Asp in the 12-amino acid Ca2+-binding loop converted GCAP-1 into a constitutive activator of RetGC (25Rudnicka-Nawrot M.

That mutant showed a similar to wild type GCAP-1 dose dependence of RetGC stimulation at low free Ca2+ but did not inhibit cyclase at high fre"

To determine whether PTP1B can modify polygenic insulin resistance, we crossed PTP1B–/– mice with mice with a double heterozygous deficiency of IR and IRS-1 alleles (DHet). DHet mice weighed slightly less than wild-type mice and exhibited severe insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, with ∼35% of DHet males developing diabetes by 9–10 weeks of age. Body weight in DHet mice with PTP1B deficiency was similar to that in DHet mice. However, absence of PTP1B in DHet mice markedly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity at 10–11 weeks of age and reduced the incidence of diabetes and hyperplastic pancreatic islets at 6 months of age. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IR, IRS proteins, Akt/protein kinase B, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and p70S6K was impaired in DHet mouse muscle and liver and was differentially improved by PTP1B deficiency. In addition, increased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression in DHet mouse liver was reversed by PTP1B deficiency. In summary, PTP1B deficiency reduces insulin resistance and hyperglycemia without altering body weight in a model of polygenic type 2 diabetes. Thus, even in the setting of high genetic risk for diabetes, reducing PTP1B is partially protective, further demonstrating its attractiveness as a target for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Insulin plays a dominant role in regulating glucose homeostasis through a highly orchestrated constellation of effects, which include promoting glucose uptake in peripheral tissues such as muscle and fat, suppressing hepatic glucose output, and regulating lipid metabolism. Failure of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin (i.e. insulin resistance) can initially be overcome by a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. When this mechanism fails to compensate sufficiently, frank diabetes and its attendant complications ensue (1Taniguchi C.M. Emanuelli B. Kahn C.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Nandi A. Kitamura Y. Kahn C.R. Accili D.

Insulin action is mediated through a complex network of signaling events, which are initiated by the binding of insulin to its cell-surface receptor, the insulin receptor (IR). 3The abbreviations used are: IR, insulin receptor; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SH2, Src homology 2; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B; DHet, double heterozygous deficiency of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 alleles; WT, wild-type; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PKB, protein kinase B; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c; ANOVA, analysis of variance. This triggers the intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity of IR, resulting in autophosphorylation of several IR tyrosyl residues and the recruitment and tyrosyl phosphorylation of IR substrate (IRS) proteins. Subsequently, molecules such as the growth factor receptor-binding protein Grb-2, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 bind to IRS proteins, leading to the metabolic and growth-promoting effects of insulin (2Cheatham B.

Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). The absence of PTP1B in all tissues is also associated with leanness and protection from diet-induced obesity owing in large part to enhanced leptin signaling because PTP1B also dephosphorylates Jak2 in the leptin signaling cascade (23Cheng A. Uetani N. Simoncic P.D. Chaubey V.P. Lee-Loy A. McGlade C.J. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L. Dev.

In general, increased adiposity is a major cause of insulin resistance (25Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2463) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been difficult to determine the extent to which enhanced insulin sensitivity in PTP1B–/– mice is due to the direct effect of the absence of PTP1B on IR signaling, as opposed to more indirect effects resulting from leanness. We recently found that deletion of PTP1B selectively in neurons increases insulin sensitivity, but as in total body PTP1B–/– mice, adiposity is reduced in neuron-specific PTP1B–/– mice (26Bence K.K. Delibegovic M. Xue B. Gorgun C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Reduction of PTP1B expression primarily in liver and adipose tissue of ob/ob mice by antisense oligonucleotides has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity, but again, largely in association with decreased adiposity (27Zinker B.A. Rondinone C.M. Trevillyan J.M. Gum R.J. Clampit J.E. Waring J.F. Xie N. Wilcox D. Jacobson P. Frost L. Kroeger P.E. Reilly R.M. Koterski S. Opgenorth T.J. Ulrich R.G. Crosby S. Butler M. Murray S.F. McKay R.A.

All of these data strongly support a physiological role for PTP1B in negatively regulating insulin signaling in rodents and humans. However, the conclusions are tempered by the fact that the accompanying changes in adiposity may play a major role in altering insulin signaling and systemic insulin sensitivity. To determine the role of PTP1B in modulating insulin signaling independent of changes in adiposity in a highly relevant diabetes model, we crossed homozygous PTP1B–/– mice with mice with a double heterozygous deficiency of IR and IRS-1 alleles (DHet) (30Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The DHet model has similarities to human type 2 diabetes in that it is polygenic in nature, has early-onset insulin resistance and is modified by both genetic background and diet (30Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31Kulkarni R.N. Almind K. Goren H.J. Winnay J.N. Ueki K. Okada T. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These mice have a 35–65% reduction in the levels of IR and IRS-1 in insulin target tissues. Although there is no apparent phenotype in either IR+/– or IRS-1+/– mice, the combination of these allelic deletions results in severe hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, β-cell hyperplasia, and ultimately, frank diabetes in 50% (30Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) to 90% (this study) of the mice on a mixed genetic background. In this study, we show that PTP1B deficiency reduces the severe hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and β-cell hypertrophy in DHet mice without affecting their body weight. Thus, we demonstrate that the absence of PTP1B protects against diabetes: 1) even in mice with a high risk for diabetes due to reduction of key signaling molecules and 2) in the absence of alterations in body weight. These data support the notion that, even in the setting of genetic defects that markedly increase diabetes risk, PTP1B is an attractive drug target for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Animals—Wild-type (WT), PTP1B–/–, and DHet mice and mice homozygous for PTP1B and heterozygous for IR and IRS-1 (DHet/PTP1B–/–) were generated as follows. Colonies of DHet and PTP1B–/– mice were first expanded by breeding DHet (30Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R.

DHet mice on a background of FVB × C57BL/6J × 129/svJ were then bred with PTP1B+/– mice on the same background to generate mice heterozygous for IR, IRS-1, and PTP1B alleles. The resulting triply heterozygous mice (IR+/–/IRS-1+/–/PTP1B+/–) were bred with mice heterozygous for PTP1B (PTP1B+/–) to generate the four genotypes WT, PTP1B–/–, DHet, and DHet/PTP1B–/– at a mendelian frequency of 6.25% for each genotype (supplemental Fig. 1). As a result of this breeding scheme, all mice used in this study were on a mixed FVB × C57BL/6J × 129/svJ background. Animals were housed with a 12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled barrier facility and had free access to water and standard laboratory chow (Purina 5053, fat content of 4.5% by weight/11.9% by calories). Mice were weighed biweekly. Metabolic Measurements—Blood was collected via tail bleed in mice in the fed state between 8 and 10 a.m. Blood glucose was measured using a OneTouch Ultra glucose meter (LifeScan, Inc., Milpitas, CA). Serum insulin and leptin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem Inc., Chicago, IL). Serum-free fatty acid levels in mice in the fed state were measured using a kit from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Richmond, VA). For glucose tolerance tests, mice were fasted overnight, and blood glucose was measured immediately before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intraperitoneal injection of glucose (1.5 g/kg of body weight). For insulin tolerance tests, food was removed for 4 h, and blood glucose was measured immediately before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after intraperitoneal injection of human insulin (1.2 and 1.0 unit/kg of body weight for males and females, respectively; Humulin®, Lilly). All metabolic measurements were performed when mice were 9–11 weeks and 6 months of age. Insulin Signaling Studies—Six-month-old male WT, PTP1B–/–, DHet, and DHet/PTP1B–/– mice were fasted overnight. Human insulin (10 units/kg of body weight; Humulin®) was injected via tail vein; 7.5 min later, mice were killed by CO2, and tissues were quickly collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were stored at –80 °C until processing. This time point was chosen to optimize the possibility of seeing increased or prolonged signaling in both muscle and liver in the absence of PTP1B (21Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). In our studies in normal mice, maximal responses have been seen with this insulin dose. Blood glucose levels were between 300 and 500 mg/dl in the majority of male DHet mice and <200 mg/dl in the majority of male DHet/PTP1B–/– mice at 6 months of age. Therefore, we chose mice with these blood glucose levels for the insulin signaling studies because we wanted to investigate whether the improved insulin sensitivity in DHet/PTP1B–/– mice could be explained by their improved insulin signaling. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and lysates were solubilized by continuous stirring for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at –80 °C until assays were performed. Lysate protein (50 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylation and total levels of specific proteins were measured by immunoblotting. To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-2, liver lysates (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-IRS-2 polyclonal antibodies (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were washed four times, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and centrifuged. Supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS2 and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) antibodies (Upstate). Rabbit anti-IR and anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibodies were produced as described previously (32Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag B. II I Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) and anti-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β; clone 4G-1E) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate. Rabbit anti-phospho-IR Tyr972, anti-phospho-IR Tyr1162/Tyr1163, and anti-phospho-IRS-1 Tyr612 polyclonal antibodies were from BioSource International Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-phospho-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) Ser473, anti-total Akt/PKB, anti-phospho-GSK3β Ser21/Ser9, and anti-phospho-p70S6K Thr389 polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against total p70S6K was a gift from Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against rat phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was a gift from Dr. Daryl K. Granner (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) (33Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K.

PI3K Activity—Muscle and liver lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with 3 μl of either anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The immune complex was washed, and PI3K activity was determined as described previously (34Kim Y-B. Peroni O.D Aschenbach W.G Minokoshi Y. Kotani K. Zisman A. Kahn C.R. Goodyear L.J. Kahn B.B Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9713-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted from liver using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. The mRNA level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) was quantified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (54Koza R.A. Hohmann S.M. Guerra C. Rossmeisl M. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34486-34492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reverse transcription-PCR conditions were 48 °C for 30 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 °C for 10 min and then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The relative copy number of cyclophilin was quantified and used for normalization. The mRNA level was calculated using a standard curve with a series of 10-fold dilutions of a mixture of representative RNA samples. Primer and probe sequences were as follows: SREBP1c, 5′-GACCACGGAGCCATGGA-3′ (forward), 5′-GGGAAGTCACTGTCTTGGTTGTT-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TGCACATTTGAAGACATGCTCCAGCTCAT-3′ (probe); and cyclophilin, 5′-GGTGGAGAGCACCAAGACAGA-3′ (forward), 5′-GCCGGAGTCGACAATGATG-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TCCTTCAGTGGCTTGTCCCGGCT-3′ (probe). Morphological and Morphometric Analysis of Pancreatic Islets—Male mice were killed at 6 months of age by CO2, and pancreata were removed, cleared of fat and lymph nodes, weighed, spread in anatomical orientation, and fixed in either 10% formalin or Bouin’s solution. Full footprint paraffin sections (5 μm) were immunostained for β-cells using a guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antiserum (Linco, St. Louis, MO) as described previously (35Bonner-Weir S. Deery D. Leahy J.L. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 49-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Cell mass was measured by point-counting morphometry (35Bonner-Weir S. Deery D. Leahy J.L. Weir G.C. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 49-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Islet morphology and morphometry were assessed without prior knowledge of the genotype. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed for statistical significance by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fischer’s probable least-squares difference post hoc test, ANOVA with repeated measures, or Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric ANOVA by rank as appropriate. Mice of the four genotypes WT, PTP1B–/–, DHet, and DHet/PTP1B–/– were used in this study. There was no difference in body weight between WT and PTP1B–/– mice on a standard chow diet at 5 weeks of age, but by 11 weeks (males) or 15 weeks (females), PTP1B–/– mice weighed less than WT mice (Fig. 1). PTP1B–/– mice also had lower epididymal fat pad mass (Table 1), indicating lower adiposity, as shown previously (22Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y-B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Although liver mass was lower in PTP1B–/– mice (Table 1), the effect was no longer present when corrected for body weight (data not shown). Male and female DHet mice weighed less than their WT littermates, as described previously (30Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 31Kulkarni R.N. Almind K. Goren H.J. Winnay J.N. Ueki K. Okada T. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and had lower fat pad mass even when corrected for lower body weight, i.e. the fat pad/body weight ratio was lower (Table 1). This most likely reflects insulin resistance in adipose tissue (31Kulkarni R.N. Almind K. Goren H.J. Winnay J.N. Ueki K. Okada T. Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1528-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Liver mass in DHet mice tended to be lower than that in WT mice, but not after correction for lower body weight (Table 1). Superimposition of PTP1B deficiency on the DHet mice (DHet/PTP1B–/–) had no further effect on body weight (Fig. 1), fat pad or liver mass, or fat pad/body weight ratio compared with DHet mice with intact PTP1B (Table 1).TABLE 1Length and organ weight in male mice at 6 months of ageGenotypeBWLengthLiverWATWAT/BWPancreasgmmgg%gWT34.3 ± 1.196.6 ± 0.951.32 ± 0.051.48 ± 0.094.30 ± 0.210.25 ± 0.02PTP1B-/-28.7 ± 0.9ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.95.8 ± 0.911.14 ± 0.04ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.0.76 ± 0.12ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.2.58 ± 0.36ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.0.22 ± 0.02DHet28.3 ± 0.9ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.94.3 ± 1.041.23 ± 0.040.76 ± 0.06ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.2.64 ± 0.16ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.0.25 ± 0.01DHet/PTP1B-/-26.9 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.93.8 ± 0.951.17 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.0.66 ± 0.05ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.2.48 ± 0.18ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.0.20 ± 0.01ap < 0.05 versus WT mice.,bp < 0.05 versus DHet mice.a p < 0.05 versus WT mice.b p < 0.05 versus DHet mice. Open table in a new tab At 9–10 weeks of age, male PTP1B–/– mice had lower serum insulin and blood glucose levels compared with WT mice (p < 0.05 versus WT mice) (Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with the higher insulin sensitivity in PTP1B–/– mice observed previously (21Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

The glucose × insulin product was also significantly lower in male PTP1B–/– compared with WT mice (63.0 ± 9.4 in PTP1B–/– mice versus 170.3 ± 33.7 in WT mice; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). There was no difference in fed insulin or glucose levels between female PTP1B–/– and WT mice (Fig. 2, D and E), similar to our previous results (22Klaman L.D. Boss O. Peroni O.D. Kim J.K. Martino J.L. Zabolotny J.M. Moghal N. Lubkin M. Kim Y-B. Sharpe A.H. Stricker-Krongrad A. Shulman G.I. Neel B.G. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5479-5489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), although the glucose × insulin product tended to be lower in female PTP1B–/– mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 2F). Because of their genetically determined insulin resistance, most male DHet mice developed severe hyperinsulinemia in the fed state, with fed insulin levels ranging 2.6–20.5-fold above WT levels (Fig. 2A). Of 31 male DHet mice examined at 9–10 weeks of age, 11 mice (35%) developed severe fed hyperglycemia of >250 mg/dl, whereas the remaining 65% had normal glycemia (Fig. 2B), consistent with the heterogeneity of diabetes incidence in this model (30Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Bonner-Weir S. Taylor S.I. Accili D. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). A blood glucose value of 250 mg/dl was used as the cutoff because no male WT mice had a higher blood glucose level. The degree of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia was milder in female DHet mice (Fig. 2, D and E). When insulin sensitivity was expressed as the glucose × insulin product, both male and female DHet mice displayed extremely high values (20- and 8-fold above WT levels, respectively; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, C and F). PTP1B deficiency completely normalized blood glucose levels in mice in the fed state (Fig. 2, B and E) and partially rescued hyperinsulinemia in male and female DHet/PTP1B–/– mice (Fig. 2, A and D). PTP1B deficiency in DHet mice also greatly reduced the glucose × insulin product (Fig. 2, C and F). Heterogeneity in blood glucose and insulin levels is found in both DHet and DHet/PTP1B–/– mice, most likely reflecting genetic modifiers due to their mixed genetic background (30Bruning J.C.

It possesses a long N-terminal cytosolic tail containing six domains that are individually folded and capable of binding one copper(I) ion each. We investigated the entire N-terminal tail (MNK1–6) in solution by NMR spectroscopy and addressed its interaction with copper(I) and with copper(I)-HAH1, the physiological partner of ATP7A. At copper(I)-HAH1:MNK1–6 ratios of up to 3:1, thus encompassing the range of protein ratios in vivo, both the first and fourth domain of the tail formed a metal-mediated adduct with HAH1 whereas the sixth domain was simultaneously able to partly remove copper(I) from HAH1. These processes are not dependent on one another. In particular, formation of the adducts is not necessary for copper(I) transfer from HAH1 to the sixth domain. The present data, together with available in vivo studies, suggest that the localization of ATP7A between the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane may be regulated by the accumulation of the adducts with HAH1, whereas the main role of domains 5 and 6 is to assist copper(I) translocation.

Human ATP7A is a P-type ATPase that receives copper(I) in the cytosol from the metallochaperone HAH1 and translocates it to the trans-Golgi network or across the plasma membrane (1Harrison M.D. Jones C.E.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). A second, closely related human copper(I)-transporting P-type ATPase is ATP7B (WLN hereafter). Mutations in ATP7A may lead to a fatal X-linked copper deficiency syndrome (4Vulpe C.D. Levinson B. Whitney S. Packman S. Gitschier J. Nat.

Mutations in WLN are instead responsible for Wilson disease (7Bull P.C. Thomas G.R. Rommens J.M. Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Nat.

Genet. 1993; 5: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). In Menkes disease, copper transport across membranes is defective, particularly in intestinal mucosal cells where copper efflux is impaired. Indeed, MNK has two important cellular functions: (i) to facilitate the export of copper from non-hepatic tissues and its absorption into circulation, and (ii) to deliver copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into copper-dependent enzymes (9Voskoboinik I. Camakaris J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To carry out both functions, MNK must be correctly localized within distinct subcellular compartments, which is achieved through a copper-dependent trafficking of the polypeptide (3Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Under low copper conditions, MNK is localized within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 2The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; WT, wild type.; copper stimulation results in the redistribution of MNK to the plasma membrane (3Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). MNK contains four major regions/domains (the N-terminal copper binding tail, the transmembrane domain, the ATP-binding domain, and the phosphatase domain) and a C-terminal tail. The N-terminal copper binding cytosolic tail of MNK is ∼650 amino acids long and contains six 70-amino acid independently folded domains, which are relatively similar in sequence and structure (10Banci L.

Each domain harbors the conserved sequence motif GMXCXXC, through which it can bind one equivalent of copper(I) (17Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18939-18944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Two outstanding open questions are (i) why mammalian MNK homologs have six metal-binding domains when lower organisms, including yeast, have only one or two, and (ii) whether there is any functional differentiation between these six domains. Complementation studies in yeast and confocal microscopy studies in mammalian cells have provided extensive information on the activity and trafficking capabilities of MNK variants. The presence of either the intact fifth or intact sixth metal-binding domain is sufficient to support both MNK activity and intracellular trafficking at levels normal or close to normal (18Cater M.A. Forbes J.R.

An artificial construct in which domains 3–6 have been removed so that domains 1 and 2 are in the same position with respect to the membrane of domains 5 and 6 in the WT protein has no trafficking ability but supports yeast growth at 25% of normal levels (22Mercer J.F. Barnes N. Stevenson J. Strausak D. Llanos R.M. Biometals. 2003; 16: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If the copper binding cysteines are mutated to serine, thus abrogating metal binding activity, MNK only localizes to the TGN even in the presence of excess copper (22Mercer J.F. Barnes N. Stevenson J. Strausak D. Llanos R.M. Biometals. 2003; 16: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the all Cys-to-Ser mutant, phosphorylation of MNK, which is the key event triggering protein migration from the TGN (24Petris M.J. Voskoboinik I. Cater M. Smith K. Kim B.E. Llanos R.M. Strausak D.

Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MNK trafficking is also affected by the presence of HAH1, which establishes the copper concentration threshold for MNK relocalization (25Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this work, we investigated the interaction of copper(I) and of copper(I)-HAH1 with the N-terminal tail of MNK (MNK1–6 hereafter) to obtain insights into the different behavior of the six metal-binding domains in the context of the entire cytosolic portion of the protein. These differences form the basis for the comprehension of the atomic level mechanism regulating MNK trafficking. Preparation of Protein Samples—For MNK1–6 expression, the DNA segment corresponding to residues 5–633 of MNK was amplified by PCR and cloned in the Gateway Entry vector pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) to include the TEV protease cleavage site at the N-terminal end. This segment was then subcloned into pDEST 17 (Invitrogen) through the Gateway LR reaction, yielding a plasmid expressing the protein with a His tag at the N terminus. The expression plasmids for all mutants were obtained through the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). WT and mutant MNK1–6 were expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Novagen) in minimal medium cultures. For isotope enrichment, (15NH4)2SO4 and [13C]glucose were used. The protein product was purified using HisTrap chelating FF columns (GE Healthcare). The His tag was cleaved with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen). Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectra. Copper(I) was added to samples in an inert atmosphere chamber (Coy Laboratory) by adding an acetonitrile solution of tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate (Cu(CH3CN)4PF6) in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. All samples contained between 0.2 and 0.5 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate at pH 7.0. HAH1 samples were prepared as previously described, always without poly-His tag (26Anastassopoulou J. Banci L.

MNK1 (spanning residues 5–77 of MNK) samples were prepared using the same protocol used for other individual domains (10Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Banci L. Bertini I. Del Conte R. D'Onofrio M. Rosato A.

In titration experiments we added copper(I)-HAH1 or copper(I)-MNK1 to apo-MNK1–6 directly in the NMR tube under N2 atmosphere. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were acquired using Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at proton frequencies of 500, 800, and 900 MHz, all equipped with cryogenically cooled probes. Resonance assignments of WT MNK1–6 (both apo and copper-loaded) were performed through conventional multidimensional NMR techniques based on triple resonance experiments (27Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Principles and Practice. 1996; (, Academic Press, San Diego, CA)Google Scholar). The backbone dynamics of apo-WT-MNK1–6 was investigated through the analysis of 15N R1, R2 relaxation rates and heteronuclear 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effects (28Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Copper(I) binding by WT or mutant MNK1–6 was assessed by titrating the protein with Cu(CH3CN)4PF6 and following the titration through 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra. Titrations of MNK1–6 with copper(I)-HAH1 or copper(I)-MNK1 were followed in the same way. Protein-protein interaction experiments were performed both with and without dithiothreitol in the solutions, which did not cause significant differences in the results. Immunoblotting—SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and human fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were maintained in 5% CO2 in air in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (NaCl 150 mm, Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7, Nonidet P-40 1%, NaF 100 mm, EGTA 2 mm) with 10% glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Protein concentration for all samples was determined by Bradford’s method (Bio-Rad). For HAH1 analysis, lysates (100 μg/μl) were heated at 100 °C for 10 min in the presence of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol and then separated by reducing SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The same procedure, but without heating, was used for the analysis of MNK. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody at 4 °C, and finally washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, washed, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Interaction of the Cytosolic Tail of MNK with Copper(I) and with Copper(I)-HAH1—The entire cytosolic tail of MNK, comprising its six copper(I)-binding domains, was expressed in E. coli as a single construct. Heterologous expression allowed us to enrich the protein in the 15N and 13C stable isotopes. Protein solubility was ∼300 μm at pH 7.0. Two-dimensional 1H-15N spectra of MNK1–6 showed a good dispersion of signals (supplemental Fig. S1), which could be assigned through conventional multidimensional NMR techniques (27Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. II I Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy.

We assigned signals from all six copper(I)-binding domains, whereas only very few signals from the segments of polypeptide chain connecting these domains could be observed. This is presumably because these regions are poorly structured and thus leave backbone amide protons unprotected and ready to exchange with the solvent. A three-domain construct containing domains 4–6 shows similar behavior (29Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Chasapis C. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38259-38263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The analysis of 15N relaxation rates for the few signals observed from residues in the linker regions showed that the flexibility of these regions uncouples the motion in solution of the various domains with the exception of domains 5 and 6, which are separated by only six amino acids and thus behave more similarly to a single rigid unit. This is also true for domains 5 and 6 of WLN (30Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). MNK1–6 could bind copper(I) when presented with Cu(CH3CN) +4, a small inorganic complex that can easily metallate copper(I) binding chaperones or ATPases (31Banci L. Rosato A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Copper(I) appeared to distribute over all the six domains (Fig. 1). Using substoichiometric copper(I) concentration, the distribution of the metal ion among the domains was shown to be slow on the NMR time scale (equilibration time lower than ms), as the spectra contained distinct signals for both the apo- and metal-bound forms. The position of the signals from the various domains did not depend on the copper(I):protein ratio, indicating that there were no copper-mediated interactions among the domains. Unfortunately, NMR spectra did not allow us to quantitate the relative affinity for copper(I) in the intact MNK tail, because of the weak signal intensities coupled with differential line broadening induced by metallation in the six domains (29Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Chasapis C. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38259-38263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This effect increased with increasing copper(I):protein ratio, leading to the spectrum of fully metallated MNK1–6 being devoid of many signals. Notably, at copper(I):protein ratios of ∼1:1 (i.e. when only 1/6 of the domains can be metallated), signals from metallated domain 3 were also observed despite its lower affinity for copper(I) when removed from the context of the entire MNK tail (13Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Della Malva N. Rosato A. Herrmann T. Wuöthrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29141-29147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We then checked whether apo-MNK1–6 was able to receive copper(I) from HAH1 and whether there was a differentiation among the six metal-binding domains in their interaction with the metallochaperone. This was done by adding copper(I)-HAH1 to MNK1–6, with one of the two proteins enriched in 15N so that only its signals appeared in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. At a 1:1 copper(I)-HAH1:15N-MNK1–6 ratio, which corresponds to one equivalent of copper(I) being available for seven binding sites (one on HAH1 and six on MNK1–6), the signals of only domains 1, 4, and 6 experienced a perturbation with respect to the spectrum of MNK1–6 alone (Fig. 2, A and B). In particular, for domain 6 a second set of signals appeared, as observed also for Cu(CH3CN) +4, corresponding to the copper(I)-bound form of this domain (Fig. 2A). Instead, copper(I)-HAH1 caused a variation of the chemical shifts of the signals from the backbone amide moieties of domains 1 and 4 (Fig. 2B), for which a single set of signals was observed throughout the titration. From the above data, it can be inferred that copper(I)-HAH1 formed detectable amounts of a macromolecular complex with both domains 1 and 4, whereas domain 6 removed copper(I) from the metallochaperone, likely through formation of a similar adduct at a concentration too low for detection by NMR. It is possible that HAH1 transfers copper(I) also to domain 5, because the signals of the copper-bound domain 5 are very weak and might have been missed in titration experiments, where broadening occurred for many MNK1–6 signals. Consistent with this picture, the interaction between apo-MNK1–6 and 15N-copper(I)-HAH1, viewed from the side of the latter, revealed both a variation of the chemical shifts of the signals from the backbone atoms of copper(I)-HAH1 (Fig. 3A) and formation of some apo-HAH1. Mapping of the chemical shift changes experienced by domains 1 and 4 and by HAH1 onto the corresponding solution structures defined the regions of inter-molecular contact (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Chemical shift perturbation data mapped onto the solution structures of HAH1 (PDB code 1TL5) (26Anastassopoulou J.

Here-after, we will refer to a mutant of MNK1–6 in which the metal binding cysteines of domain n had been mutated to alanine as CnMNK1–6 (e.g. C1MNK1–6 identifies the mutant lacking the cysteines of domain 1). In the interaction of C1MNK1–6 with copper(I)-HAH1, we still observed chemical shift variations for residues belonging to domain 4 (Fig. 2C) as well as the appearance of a new set of signals belonging to metallated domain 6, analogous to what observed for WT-MNK1–6. Instead, signals from residues of domain 1 did not experience any appreciable chemical shift changes, indicating that the two metal binding cysteines are necessary to promote protein-protein association between this domain and copper(I)-HAH1. C4MNK1–6 had a complementary behavior, with domains 1 and 4 swapping their roles with respect to the case of C1MNK1–6 (Fig. 2D). When looking at 15N-HAH1, chemical shift variations as well as formation of some apoprotein took place upon interaction with either C1MNK1–6 or C4MNK1–6. The chemical shift changes for HAH1 were localized to the same regions in the presence of either MNK1–6 mutant, as well as of WT-MNK1–6, indicating that the area of intermolecular contact on HAH1 was essentially the same in all cases (Fig. 3, B and C). The signals of neither domain 1 nor domain 4 experienced chemical shift variations in WT-MNK1–6 when the latter was titrated with apo-HAH1. Addition of copper(I) at equimolar concentration with respect to HAH1 triggered chemical shift changes. The intermolecular interaction is thus copper-mediated, due to the presence of a bridging copper ion, analogous to the yeast Atx:Ccc2a system (32Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Domain 6 Can Receive Copper(I) Directly from HAH1 or Other Domains—We then studied the interaction of copper(I)-HAH1 with C1,4MNK1–6 to assess whether copper(I) delivery to the sixth domain from HAH1 must occur sequentially through domains 1 and/or 4 or can be the result of the direct interaction between domain 6 and HAH1 through formation of a reaction intermediate that does not accumulate in the NMR sample, or both. In the former case, C1,4MNK1–6 should be unable to uptake copper(I) in the sixth domain even though the metal-binding site is present. Instead, experiments showed that copper(I)-HAH1 can metallate domain 6 in C1,4MNK1–6 independently of the presence of external thiols, such as dithiothreitol. The signals of HAH1 did not experience chemical shift changes upon interaction with C1,4MNK1–6, whereas the apoprotein formed. Metal transfer thus occurred with a slow kinetics with respect to the NMR time scale, as already observed for WT-MNK1–6. The C1,2,3,4MNK1–6 quadruple mutant could receive copper(I) from copper(I)-HAH1 as well as from copper(I)-MNK1, both of which were able to metallate domains 5 and 6. In a further experiment, we added an equimolar mixture of MNK1 and copper(I)-HAH1 to 15N-C1,2,3,4MNK1–6, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 copper(I):MNK1:HAH1:15N-C1,2,3,4MNK1–6 ratio. The aim of this experiment was to verify whether, besides direct transfer of copper(I) to the sixth domain of MNK1–6 from HAH1 or MNK1, a cascade mechanism could also be operative. In this mechanism, free, metallated domain 1 (or domain 4) or HAH1, in equilibrium with the metal-bridged adduct, would transfer the copper(I) ion to domain 6 for subsequent transport across the membrane. Under these conditions, a small fraction of metallated C1,2,3,4MNK1–6 was formed, indicating that the MNK1-copper(I)-HAH1 complex can deliver copper(I) to domain 6 even though it is quite stable with respect to dissociation. MNK (as well as WLN) interacts specifically with HAH1 to receive copper(I) from it (33Hamza I. Schafer M. Klomp L.W. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13363-13368Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 34Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This interaction is needed to sustain copper delivery to cuproenzymes, because the intracellular concentration of free aqueous copper is vanishingly small (35Rae T. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). In vitro, the six soluble copper(I)-binding domains of MNK could simultaneously be metallated by Cu(CH3CN) +4 (Fig. 1). At substoichiometric Cu(CH3CN) +4 concentrations (<six copper(I) ions/protein molecule), all MNK domains were partly metallated, indicating that they have similar affinities for copper(I). An analogous observation has been reported also for the six domains of WLN (34Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36Wernimont A.K. Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12269-12276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly to Cu(CH3CN) +4, copper(I)-HAH1 could metallate all six domains of MNK or WLN. The copper(I) affinity of HAH1 is slightly lower than that of the soluble domains of its partners (11Banci L. Bertini I. Chasapis C. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Hadjiliadis N. Rosato A. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Yatsunyk L.A. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8622-8631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and thus the transfer is thermodynamically favored. However, there was a substantial difference in the behavior of apo-MNK1–6 when presented with substoichiometric quantity of copper(I)-HAH1 instead of Cu(CH3CN) +4. Indeed, copper(I)-HAH1 did not interact equally with all domains, but it formed a copper(I)-bridged intermolecular adduct with both domains 1 and 4 of MNK1–6 and at the same time transferred copper(I) to domain 6 (and probably to domain 5 as well, as suggested by the analysis of the C1,2,3,4MNK1–6 mutant). At 3:1 copper(I)-HAH1:MNK1–6 ratio, domains 2 and 3 essentially did not interact with copper(I)-HAH1 nor were they metallated. Protein quantification using Western blotting indicated the intracellular HAH1:MNK ratios are of the order 1:1–1:2 (not shown), thus well within the range sampled in this work. Addition of Cu(CH3CN) +4 to MNK1–6 results in the appearance of a second set of signals for all domains. The additional signals could be assigned to the copper(I)-bound form of the residues close to the two metal binding cysteines of all six MNK1–6 domains (Fig. 1). In the presence of copper(I)-HAH1 the same feature was observed only for domains 5 and 6 of MNK1–6. Instead, for domains 1 and 4 we observed a variation of the chemical shifts of the signals from residues close to the two binding cysteines and in the loop following the second α-helix, defining a well distinct protein-protein interaction region (Fig. 4) analogous to what was found for the yeast Atx1:Ccc2a system. This suggests that these two domains form an adduct with copper(I)-HAH1 with a configuration similar to that of the homologous yeast system (32Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 37Bertini I. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Pierattelli R. Spyranti Z. Spyroulias G.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2006; 36: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Domains 1 and 4 of MNK1–6 reacted independently with copper(I)-HAH1. Mutation of the metal binding cysteines to alanine in either of the two domains abrogated its interaction with the partner but left the other domain capable of forming the intermolecular adduct. Both the dependence of the formation on the presence of the metal binding cysteines (Fig. 2, C and D) and the fact that isolated domain 1 interacts with HAH1 only in the presence of copper indicate that the adduct created is a metal-mediated (32Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Felli I.C. Gonnelli L. Hadjiliadis N. Pierattelli R. Rosato A. Voulgaris P. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 367-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) one. By comparing the chemical shift variations measured for HAH1 upon interaction with either C1MNK1–6 or C4MNK1–6, it appears that the adduct formed with domain 4 has a higher formation constant than the adduct formed with domain 1. Note that metal transfer to domain 6 leaves unaffected the chemical shift values (and other NMR properties) of both apo- and copper(I)-HAH1, as shown previously for isolated domain 6 (10Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Migliardi M. Rosato A. Wang S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and here by studying C1,4MNK1–6 and C1,2,3,4MNK1–6, but contributes to determining the distribution of the copper(I) ion among the various binding sites available. Formation of an intermolecular adduct between copper(I)-HAH1 and domain 4 of WLN had been reported previously (30Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In WLN, however, domains 5 and 6 are unable to receive copper(I) from HAH1 and thus the interaction of copper(I)-HAH1 with domain 4 was proposed to be instrumental for metal loading into the latter two domains (30Achila D. Banci L. Bertini I. Bunce J. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5729-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that both C1,4MNK1–6 and C1,2,3,4MNK1–6 could receive copper(I) directly from the metallochaperone. A mechanism in which copper(I)-HAH1 first forms an adduct with domains 1 or 4, and then the copper(I) ion is transferred by one of these domains to domain 6 or 5, can also contribute. On the basis of the above data, it is possible to attempt an interpretation of the data available in the literature on cellular studies. The presence in WLN of domain 6 alone is sufficient to complement a Δccc2 yeast (38Forbes J.R. Hsi G. Cox D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12408-12413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The copper transport activity (also measured from complementation experiments in Δccc2 yeast) of MNK having only intact domain 6 is close to normal levels as well (22Mercer J.F. Barnes N. Stevenson J. Strausak D. Llanos R.M. Biometals. 2003; 16: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The same is true for MNK having only intact domain 5 or having both domains 5 and 6. Normal copper transfer activity of these mutants in vivo is fully justified by our present observation that HAH1 can directly transfer the metal ion to domain 6 within the entire cytosolic MNK tail (MNK1–6) and that direct transfer still takes place after the cysteines of domains 1 to 4 are mutated to alanine. A peculiarity of the MNK and WLN proteins with respect to yeast ccc2 is that they can traffic from the TGN, respectively, to the plasma membrane or to intracellular vesicles when environmental copper levels are high (3Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Thanks to this feature, MNK can carry out two different physiological functions, i.e. either exporting copper(I) from intestinal cells or loading copper(I) into the TGN. HAH1 plays an essential role in the process of MNK relocalization (25Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Intracellular trafficking of MNK and WLN requires formation of an acylphosphate intermediate (24Petris M.J. Voskoboinik I. Cater M. Smith K. Kim B.E. Llanos R.M. Strausak D. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46736-46742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Formation of this intermediate is partly affected by the cytosolic copper(I)-binding sites and by the intramembrane copper(I)-binding site (CPC), whose presence enhances the efficiency of the trafficking process (21Cater M.A. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The localization of MNK or WLN is thus dependent on the balance between the rate of formation of the acylphosphate intermediate, which stimulates trafficking to the plasma membrane or vesicular compartments, and the rate of protein dephosphorylation, which determines back-trafficking from the membrane to the TGN. All these observations can be rationalized by assuming that formation of the copper(I)-bridged adduct of HAH1 with domain 1 or domain 4, or both, is important in determining the balance between forward and back-trafficking (Fig. 5). Indeed, an interaction between the ATP-binding domain of WLN and its cytosolic tail has been demonstrated that can regulate the affinity for ATP of the former (39Tsivkovskii R. MacArthur B.C. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The present data indicate that at high copper levels the adduct of HAH1 with one or both domains 1 and 4 of MNK accumulates in the cell. The adduct could contribute to enhancing the rate of phosphorylation of MNK or stabilize the acylphosphate intermediate with respect to dephosphorylation, or both. By increasing the life time of phosphorylated MNK the copper(I)-dependent macromolecular adduct involving HAH1 and domains 1 or 4 would thus promote the localization of MNK to the plasma membrane, leading to copper(I) export from the cytosolic space. The direct involvement of HAH1 in regulating the trafficking of MNK proposed here is in agreement with the effects of HAH1 knock out observed in vivo (25Hamza I. Prohaska J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1215-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Additional molecular events may also concur to this same purpose, such as conformational changes or variations of domain-domain dynamics in the cytosolic regions of MNK induced by copper(I) binding to the N-terminal tail (e.g. to domains 2 or 3) (13Banci L.

In hereditary MSI cases, it is the consequence of germline mutations of one of the MMR genes. We analysed the MLH1 promoter for methylation using the methylation-specific PCR technique. With a previously described and widely used primer set, a number of samples with an intact MMR system were found to have methylated MLH1 promoter, a finding normally associated with lack of MLH1 expression. Another primer set, specific for a more proximal region of the promoter, gave results that correlated more closely with loss of MLH1 expression. We then conducted a survey of the literature on the subject, and a total of 161 articles were examined. Although it was shown as early as 1999 that absence of MLH1 expression correlated with methylation of the proximal but not distal regions of the MLH1 promoter, 60% of published studies analysed nonspecific regions. Our findings suggest that these studies are likely to have wrongly estimated the association between methylation of the MLH1 gene and the lack of its protein expression."
https://openalex.org/W2037967822,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate signaling from extracellular ligands to intracellular signal transduction proteins. Methuselah (Mth) is a class B (secretin-like) GPCR, a family typified by their large, ligand-binding, N-terminal extracellular domains. Downregulation of mth increases the life span of Drosophila melanogaster; inhibitors of Mth signaling should therefore enhance longevity. We used mRNA display selection to identify high-affinity (K(d) = 15 to 30 nM) peptide ligands that bind to the N-terminal ectodomain of Mth. The selected peptides are potent antagonists of Mth signaling, and structural studies suggest that they perturb the interface between the Mth ecto- and transmembrane domains. Flies constitutively expressing a Mth antagonist peptide have a robust life span extension, which suggests that the peptides inhibit Mth signaling in vivo. Our work thus provides new life span-extending ligands for a metazoan and a general approach for the design of modulators of this important class of GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2151912994,"Ecto-phosphorylation is emerging as an important mechanism to regulate cellular ligand interactions and signal transduction. Here we show that extracellular phosphorylation of the cell surface receptor collagen XVII regulates shedding of its ectodomain. Collagen XVII, a member of the novel family of collagenous transmembrane proteins and component of the hemidesmosomes, mediates adhesion of the epidermis to the dermis in the skin. The ectodomain is constitutively shed from the cell surface by metalloproteinases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, mainly by tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). We used biochemical, mutagenesis, and structural modeling approaches to delineate mechanisms controlling ectodomain cleavage. A standard assay for extracellular phosphorylation, incubation of intact keratinocytes with cell-impermeable [γ-32P]ATP, led to collagen XVII labeling. This was significantly diminished by both broad-spectrum extracellular kinase inhibitor K252b and a specific casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitor. Collagen XVII peptides containing a putative CK2 recognition site were phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro, disclosing Ser542 and Ser544 in the ectodomain as phosphate group acceptors. Phosphorylation of Ser544 in vivo and in vitro was confirmed by immunoblotting of epidermis and HaCaT keratinocyte extracts with phosphoepitope-specific antibodies. Functionally, inhibition of CK2 kinase activity or mutation of the phosphorylation acceptor Ser544 to Ala significantly increased ectodomain shedding, whereas overexpression of CK2α inhibited cleavage of collagen XVII. Structural modeling suggested that the phosphorylation of serine residues prevents binding of TACE to its substrate. Thus, extracellular phosphorylation of collagen XVII by ecto-CK2 inhibits its shedding by TACE and represents novel mechanism to regulate adhesion and motility of epithelial cells.

Cells need a versatile, fast mechanism to respond to changes in their microenvironment during development, growth, and regeneration. Regulated proteolysis on the cell surface offers a post-translational mechanism to remove or structurally modify surface associated proteins at any time (1Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). For a multitude of type I and type II transmembrane proteins, such as receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and growth factors, soluble forms have been identified that have functions distinct from their membrane-bound counterparts. These are often generated through ectodomain shedding, a general mechanism that influences interactions of different cell types with the environment in a broad spectrum of biological and pathological processes (1Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Bissell M.J. Kenny P.A. Radisky D.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2005; 70: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, regulation of the ectodomain shedding remains poorly understood, namely, targeting of the sheddase to particular substrate depending on biological context. One prime example in this context is collagen XVII, a prototype of the novel family of collagenous transmembrane proteins (3Franzke C.W. Bruckner P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4005-4008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is a structural component of hemidesmosomes that mediate adhesion of the epidermal keratinocytes to the underlying basement membrane in the skin (4Nishizawa Y. Uematsu J. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). As a transmembrane component within the multiprotein complexes, collagen XVII constitutes an important link between intra- and extracellular structural elements. This is indirectly demonstrated by human diseases, caused by loss of collagen XVII functions. Mutations in the COL17A1 gene lead to absence or diminished expression of collagen XVII and to junctional epidermolysis bullosa, a hereditary disorder characterized by dermal-epidermal separation and skin blistering (5McGrath J.A. Gatalica B. Christiano A.M. Li K. Owaribe K. McMillan J.R. Eady R.A. Uitto J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune blistering disease, autoantibodies targeting collagen XVII disrupt dermal-epidermal cohesion (6Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K. Wojnarowska F. Schacke H. Zillikens D. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Like all collagenous transmembrane proteins, collagen XVII is positioned in the plasma membrane in type II orientation, and the ectodomain is constitutively shed from the cell surface. The cleavage occurs extracellularly, within the juxtamembranous linker domain NC16A (Fig. 1) (7Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Borradori L. Huotari V. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24521-24529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Metalloproteases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TACE, TNF-α-converting enzyme; CK1, -2, casein kinases 1 and 2; HA, hemagglutinin; TBB, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole. family catalyze this process, with ADAM17/TACE (TNF-α converting enzyme) appearing to be the major sheddase of collagen XVII (8Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). TACE, a transmembrane enzyme itself, is involved in the shedding of a variety of type I and II transmembrane proteins (9Black R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Substrate recognition by TACE was thought to depend on structural motifs rather than a common consensus sequence (9Black R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, certain sequence preferences in recognition have been determined, for example lipophilic amino acids, such as leucine and valine, in the P1′ position and basic amino acids in the P2′ position (10Lambert M.H. Blackburn R.K. Seaton T.D. Kassel D.B. Kinder D.S. Leesnitzer M.A. Bickett D.M. Warner J.R. Andersen M.W. Badiang J.G. Cowan D.J. Gaul M.D. Petrov K.G. Rabinowitz M.H. Wiethe R.W. Becherer J.D. McDougald D.L. Musso D.L. Andrews R.C. Moss M.L. Comb. Chem. High Throughput. Screen. 2005; 8: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In pro-TNFα, the cleavage by TACE occurs between Ala and Val, followed by Arg and Ser (11Black R.A. Durie F.H. Otten-Evans C. Miller R. Slack J.L. Lynch D.H. Castner B. Mohler K.M. Gerhart M. Johnson R.S. Itoh Y. Okada Y. Nagase H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Notch, another substrate of TACE, is also cleaved between Ala and Val adjacent to Lys and Ser (12Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). The functional role of ectodomain shedding of collagen XVII lies in the regulation of epithelial cell adhesion, detachment, and motility during development, differentiation, and regeneration. Cleavage of the ectodomain facilitates release of the cell from its binding partners in the microenvironment. The mechanisms regulating the shedding are slowly emerging. Recently we found that variable distribution of collagen XVII molecules between the lipid raft and non-raft membrane fractions regulates its accessibility to TACE, which is localized mainly outside of lipid rafts (13Zimina E.P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Franzke C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34019-34024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other investigators had shown collagen XVII to be phosphorylated, but neither the site of phosphorylation, nor the responsible kinases, nor the functional consequences were delineated (14Kitajima Y. Owada M.K. Fujisawa Y. Seishima M. Yaoita H. Hirako Y. Owaribe K. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1995; 4: 70-75PubMed Google Scholar). Here we present evidence for extracellular phosphorylation of collagen XVII by the ecto-protein kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) and for its role in the regulation of ectodomain shedding. Extracellular phosphorylation is emerging as a novel mechanism in regulation of many biological processes, such as cell adhesion and proliferation, or mechanisms of immune response (15Redegeld F.A. Caldwell C.C. Sitkovsky M.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ecto-protein kinases act on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and use extracellular nucleoside-triphosphates as co-substrates. They phosphorylate membrane-bound proteins, extracellular matrix proteins, and soluble factors, using extracellular ATP as a source of the phosphate group (15Redegeld F.A. Caldwell C.C. Sitkovsky M.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The nucleotides can be derived from the intracellular pool through selective membrane permeabilization, transport in vesicles, or cell disruption (15Redegeld F.A. Caldwell C.C. Sitkovsky M.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Alternatively, extracellular ATP can be synthesized from cAMP and ADP (15Redegeld F.A.

CK2 is a highly conserved protein kinase expressed in nearly every eukaryotic tissue and cellular compartment (17Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 18Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). It is active as a heterotetramer of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits and phosphorylates mainly serine or threonine residues, with some tyrosine kinase activity (17Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). CK2 has a variety of intracellular substrates, and it is important for the control of cell cycle progression and apoptosis (18Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, it is also active as an ecto-protein kinase (19Walter J. Kinzel V. Kubler D. Cell Mol. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 10265-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This seems to link ecto-CK2 activity to cell adhesion and migration processes, as well as to bone formation and pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. In general, phosphorylation is a well established mechanism of modulating the interaction between individual proteins, including interactions of proteases with their substrates (26Benore-Parsons M. Seidah N.G. Wennogle L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Fluhrer R. Friedlein A. Haass C. Walter J. J. Biol.

Here, we identified collagen XVII as a new extracellular substrate of ecto-CK2 and show that serine phosphorylation within the NC16A domain interferes with ectodomain shedding, presumably by perturbing the binding of collagen XVII to TACE. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—HaCaT cells were cultured in keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor as described (28Schacke H. Schumann H. Hammami-Hauasli N. Raghunath M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25937-25943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. All media and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. Transfection of 90% confluent cells was carried out with 1 μg of DNA/0.5 × 106 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 48 h prior to harvest, the medium was supplemented with 50 μg/ml l-ascorbate. Preparation of cDNA Constructs—Full-length collagen XVII cDNA inserted into pcDNA3 was a generous gift of Dr. L. Borradori, University of Geneva. The plasmids encoding HA-tagged CK2α and CK2α K58A were kindly provided by Dr. Stephan Bek (Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg). The EcoRV/ClaI fragment spanning nucleotides 1374-2548 of human collagen XVII cDNA was subcloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene) and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers: 5′-GACAAAATAGGCCTGCACAGTGACGCCCAGGAGGAGCTCT-3′ and 5′-AGAGCTCCTCCTGGGCGTCACTGTGCAGGCCTATTTTGTC-3′ for collagen XVII (S544A); 5′-AAAATTGGGCTGCACGCTGACGCCCAGGAGGAGCTCTGGATG-3′ and 5′-CATCCAGAGCTCCTCCTGGGCGTCAGCGTGCAGCCCAATTTT-3′ for collagen XVII (S[542,544]A); using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) followed by replacement of the wild-type EcoRV/ClaI fragment with the respective mutant fragment. Extracellular Phosphorylation Assay—Subconfluent HaCaT keratinocytes were treated for 30 min with or without 30 μm 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole (TBB) or 1 μg/ml K252b (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). After complete removal of medium, the cells were labeled for 30 min in phosphorylation buffer (70 mm NaCl, 5 mm (CH3COO)2Mg, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.3) supplemented with 330 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) in the presence or absence of 30 μm TBB or 1 μg/ml K252b. Phosphorylation was terminated by extensive washing of the cells with ice-cold phosphorylation buffer containing 2 mm unlabeled ATP. Subsequently, cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, proteinase inhibition mixture set III (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibition mixture 1 (Sigma-Aldrich). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and collagen XVII was immunoprecipitated with the collagen XVII antibody endo-2 (6Schumann H. Baetge J. Tasanen K. Wojnarowska F. Schacke H. Zillikens D. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 685-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions at 95 °C and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad), and radiolabeled proteins were detected by phosphorimaging. Expression of collagen XVII was monitored by incubation of HaCaT keratinocytes with 30 μm TBB or 1 μg/ml K252b for 60 min, followed by lysis and immunoblotting with endo-2 antibodies (6Schumann H.

CK2 in Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—Phosphorylation of synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 530-559 of wild-type collagen XVII, AAGADLDKIGLHSDSQEELWMFVRKKLMME, collagen XVII(S544A), AAGADLDKIGLHSDAQEELWMFVRKKLMME, and collagen XVII(S[542,544]A), AAGADLDKIGLHADAQEELWMFVRKKLMME (PANATecs GmbH, Tuebingen, Germany) by CK2 was analyzed with the casein kinase 2 assay kit (Upstate, Schwalbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the peptides were incubated with CK2 (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min (GE Healthcare). The reaction was terminated by addition of 40% trichloroacetic acid, and phosphorylated peptides were bound to P81 phosphocellulose. After repeated washing with 0.75% phosphoric acid, the peptides were fixed onto the membrane with acetone, and incorporated radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter (Canberra-Packard GmbH, Schwadorf, Austria). Phosphoepitope Antibodies—The antibody pSer544 was raised by immunizing rabbits with the peptide DKIGLHSD(phosS)QEELWMFE (PANATecs GmbH). For analysis of antibody specificity, peptides representing the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated epitopes of collagen XVII were biotinylated with a biotinylation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 0.1 μg of biotinylated peptide was bound to streptavidin-coated plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany), and pSer544 was applied in dilutions of 1:200 to 1:10,000. As a control, the NC16A antibody was used in dilution 1:500. Binding of the primary antibodies was determined by colorimetric detection of an alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) using the BluePhos Microwell phosphatase substrate system (KPL, Gaithersburg, MA). pSer544 was affinity-purified using the peptide AAGADLDKIGLHSD(phosS)QEELWMFVRKKLMME immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose-4B gel (Invitrogen). After elution, the specificity of the purified antibody was determined by dot-blot analysis using 0.1 μg of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated biotinylated peptide as an antigen on an SAM2 Biotin Capture membrane (Promega, Madison, WI). Phosphatase Treatment—350 μl of lysate of subconfluent HaCaT cells was supplemented either with 2 mm MnCl2 and 800 units of l phosphatase (New England Biolabs) or the phosphatase inhibition mixture 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by boiling the probes for 3 min in SDS sample buffer, and the lysates were immunoblotted with pSer544, NC16A antibody (4Nishizawa Y. Uematsu J. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) or anti-phospho mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/p44 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Epidermal Extracts—The epidermis was separated from the dermis by incubation in a buffer containing 1 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 mm EDTA, phosphatase inhibition mixture 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 5 h under constant stirring. The epidermis was mechanically peeled off and briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were extracted by a 5-min incubation in SDS sample buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol at 95 °C. Collagen XVII Extraction and Shedding Assays—Cell culture medium and cell extracts were collected and processed separately, as described (8Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was collected on ice, supplemented with 1 mm Pefabloc (Merck) and 1 mm EDTA (Sigma) and clarified from debris by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m NaCl, proteinase inhibition mixture set III (Calbiochem), and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The cell lysate was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell culture supernatants were precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, normalized in protein content, and analyzed by immunoblotting with the NC16A antibody. Semiquantitative densitometry was performed with the Gel-Pro Express 4.0 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). The effect of extracellular phosphorylation on shedding was determined by treatment of HaCaT keratinocytes with 1-2 μg/ml K252b, 75-150 μm TBB, and 75 μm D4476 in keratinocyte growth medium (Calbiochem) for 120 min prior to extraction. To estimate the effect of CK2 overexpression on shedding, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with a cDNA for collagen XVII and for HA-tagged CK2α or the catalytically inactive mutant CK2α K58A and analyzed 48 h after the transfection, as described above. The presence of both CK2 variants in the extracellular space was confirmed by precipitating the culture medium with ethanol at -20 °C and immunoblotting with anti-HA tag antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Shedding in COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type collagen XVII and the mutants collagen XVII (S544A) or collagen XVII (S[542,544]A) was analyzed 24 h after the transfection, as described above. TACE Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Activity Assay—HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with 1-2 μg/ml K252b and 75-150 μm TBB in keratinocyte growth medium for 120 min, and expression and activity of TACE were determined in parallel. The expression levels of TACE were assayed by Quantikine human TACE/ADAM17 Immunoassay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cells were lysed with the provided lysis buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibition mixture set III (Calbiochem) and phosphatase inhibition mixture 1 (Sigma-Aldrich), and TACE concentration was determined by using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. TACE specific activity in lysates was determined by in vitro enzymatic assay with TACE fluorogenic peptide substrate III (R&D systems). First TACE was immobilized onto a microplate coated with a monoclonal antibody against TACE (kit component 892721), and after extensive washing, 10 μm TACE substrate peptide in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was added for 120 min. The TACE inhibitor TAPI-0 (TNF-α protease inhibitor 0; Calbiochem) was added as a negative control for assay specificity. Fluorescence was measured by the microplate reader Infinite 200 (Tecan Group Ltd., Germany) with excitation at 320 nm and emission at 405 nm. Molecular Docking—Modeling of the interactions between TACE and its substrates was performed with AutoDock 3.0 (29Goodsell D.S. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar), utilizing a Lamarckian genetic algorithm. AutoDock 3.0 uses a force field-base empirical free energy-scoring function, taking into account potential energies (Lennard-Jones dispersion/repulsion interactions, hydrogen bonds, and Coulombic electrostatic potentials) and the unfavorable entropy of ligand binding. For the zinc ion involved in the binding, we used previously described force field parameters (R = 0.87 Å, e = 0.35 kcal/mol, and the formal charge of +0.95e) (30Hu X. Shelver W.H. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2003; 22: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All available structures of TACE-ligand complexes (PDB accession numbers 1BKC, 1ZXC, 2A8H, 2DDF, and 2FV9) were used for testing of docking parameters. The active site of TACE was defined using a grid of 80 × 80 × 80 points with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å centered on the ligand in the published crystal structure (31Maskos K. Fernandez-Catalan C.

We performed 100 independent runs with a maximum number of 27,000 Lamarckian genetic algorithm operations on a single population of 50 individuals. The high resolution structure of TACE provided in PDB accession number 1BKC was used as a target for molecular docking of peptides representing pro-TNFα (75QAVRS79) and collagen XVII (538IGLHS542). All possible torsion angles within the peptides were treated as flexible, and a water molecule was placed near the zinc ion and the side chain of Glu406. The structures of QAVRS, which showed a minimal distance between the water molecule and the hydrolyzed 76Ala-Val77 peptide bond, and the IGHLS structure corresponding to it were further refined using the energy-minimization routine of Gromacs software (32Van Der S.D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (11665) Google Scholar). Transition state-like structures were obtained by applying additional harmonic potential between the oxygen of the water molecule and the carbon atom of Ala (Gly) residues of QAVRS and IGHLS during energy minimization. Collagen XVII Is Extracellularly Phosphorylated by CK2—Phosphorylation is known to regulate protein-protein interactions, including the binding of proteases to their substrates. Based on the preliminary findings of serine phosphorylation in collagen XVII derived from a carcinoma cell line (14Kitajima Y. Owada M.K. Fujisawa Y. Seishima M. Yaoita H. Hirako Y. Owaribe K. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1995; 4: 70-75PubMed Google Scholar), we first determined the phosphorylation status of authentic collagen XVII in HaCaT keratinocytes. To reveal potential extracellular phosphorylation of collagen XVII, we used labeling with cell-impermeable [γ-32P]ATP, a standard assay of extracellular phosphorylation (23Trachana V. Christophorides E. Kouzi-Koliakos K. Koliakos G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 478-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because ATP cannot permeate the plasma membrane, incubation of intact cells with [γ-32P]ATP leads to selective incorporation of radioactive phosphate groups into extracellular protein domains in the presence of ecto-protein kinases. After the labeling, collagen XVII was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which clearly demonstrated its phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Addition of the broad-spectrum inhibitor of extracellular kinases, K252b (23Trachana V. Christophorides E. Kouzi-Koliakos K. Koliakos G. Int. J. Biochem.

These observations demonstrated that the extracellular domain of collagen XVII is phosphorylated and that extracellular CK2 is involved in the process. Extracellular CK2 Phosphorylates Ser542 and Ser544 in Collagen XVII—Analysis of the primary sequence of collagen XVII revealed a minimal consensus sequence for phosphorylation by CK2 within the NC16A domain (Fig. 1).

Non-ribosomally synthesized peptides constitute a medicinally important class of structurally diverse natural products from bacteria. Their biosynthesis is typically performed by the stepwise condensation of amino acid building blocks on large multimodular proteins called non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). 2The abbreviations used are: NRPS, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases; NRP, non-ribosomal peptide; MIO, 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one; pHCA, p-hydroxycinnamic acid; OPA-NAC, o-phthaldialdehyde-N-acetyl-l-cysteine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MW, molecular weight; WT, wild type; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BPC, base peak chromatogram; +MS, positive ionization mass spectrometry; m/z, mass to charge ratio; TAM, tyrosine aminomutase; Rt, retention time. Within each NRPS module, individual adenylation (A) domains are responsible for activating the amino acid substrates, which are then tethered as thioesters to the integral peptidyl carrier proteins (1Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Peptide bond formation is accomplished by the component condensation (C) domains present in each module. Chain extension is ultimately terminated by a thioesterase domain located at the end of the assembly lines. In addition to the 20 standard amino acids, many NRPS systems incorporate non-proteinogenic amino acids into their products. Notable among these are the β-amino acids, which although rare in nature, are found in a number of naturally occurring NRP metabolites produced by marine organisms and terrestrial prokaryotes (3Zabriskie T.M. Klocke J.A. Ireland C.M. Marcus A.H. Molinski T.F. Faulkner D.J. Xu C. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 3123-3124Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 4Hu J.L. Xue Y.C. Xie M.Y. Zhang R.

These natural products not only exhibit a diverse range of biological activities, but also increased resistance to proteolytic enzymes (8Mootz H.D. Schwarzer D.

Rep. 2003; 20: 275-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, attempts to tailor the pharmacological properties of NRP metabolites by genetic engineering may benefit from studies of A domains specific for β-amino acids as well as the pathways by which these unusual amino acids are formed in bacteria (10Keller U. Schauwecker F. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Walsh C.T.

The aminomutase SgcC4 from the gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of the enediyne antibiotic C-1027 in Streptomyces globisporus, catalyzes the conversion of l-tyrosine to (S)-β-tyrosine, which is then further transformed to (S)-3-chloro-4,5-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine (13Christenson S.D. Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). SgcC4 does not exhibit sequence similarity to known classes of aminomutases, but instead to phenylalanine and histidine ammonium lyases (13Christenson S.D. Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Members of this family contain a signature Ala-Ser-Gly motif, which rearranges to the prosthetic group, 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) (14Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MIO acts as the catalytic electrophile in the enzyme active site, promoting the difficult α,β elimination of ammonia from the amino acid (15Poppe L. Rétey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 117: 3734-3754Crossref Google Scholar). This elimination also constitutes the first half of the SgcC4-catalyzed transformation, but instead of releasing the resultant ammonia and α,β-unsaturated acid as free products, the enzyme catalyzes Michael addition between the enzyme-bound intermediates, affording the β-amino acid as an end product. The shared evolutionary origin of the lyases and SgcC4 is strongly supported by the fact that SgcC4 also possesses ammonium lyase activity, generating free p-hydroxycinnamic acid (pHCA) as a minor product during catalysis. SgcC4 also exhibits an unexpected β-tyrosine racemase activity, possibly because its evolutionary conversion into an aminomutase from a lyase is not complete (14Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, although the (S)-β-tyrosine is the kinetically preferred product of SgcC4, the enzyme can efficiently add ammonia to either face of the planar pHCA intermediate (14Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chondramides A–D (Fig. 1A), a family of molecules which potently affect the function of the actin cytoskeleton, contain both polyketide and polypeptide building blocks, including a β-tyrosine or α-methoxy β-tyrosine moiety (16Jansen R. Kunze B. Reichenbach H. Höfle G. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1996; : 285-290Google Scholar, 17Sasse F. Kunze B. Gronewold T.M. Reichenbach H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1559-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These metabolites exhibit striking structural similarity to the jaspamides, a family of depsipeptide natural products derived from the marine sponge Jaspis (3Zabriskie T.M. Klocke J.A. Ireland C.M. Marcus A.H. Molinski T.F. Faulkner D.J. Xu C. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 3123-3124Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar), suggesting a common biosynthetic origin. In the jaspamides, the configuration of the β-tyrosine moiety is (R), indicating that the stereochemistry of the corresponding residue in the chondramides could also be (R). As these are to our knowledge the first secondary metabolites known to incorporate (R)-β-tyrosine, the origin of this moiety is unclear. Thus we aimed to take advantage of the recently sequenced chondramide gene cluster from Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5 (18Rachid S. Krug D. Kochems I. Kunze B. Scharfe M. Blöcker H. Zabriski M. Müller R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 14: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar) to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway to (R)-β-tyrosine and to determine its mode of incorporation into the natural product. Determination of the Configuration of β-Tyrosine in Chondramide D—1.5 mg of chondramide D was hydrolyzed in 1.5 ml of HCl (6 N) at 99 °C for 12 h. The solvent was removed by evaporation, and then 150 μl of borate buffer (0.4 m, pH 10.2) was added to the solid residue and the suspension clarified by centrifugation. A 50-μl aliquot of the supernatant was subjected to chiral derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde-N-acetyl-l-cysteine (OPA-NAC) reagent (19Buck R.H. Krummen K. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 387: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). HPLC separation of the reaction mixture was performed on a Synergi HydroRP column (150 × 2 mm, 4-μm particle size; Phenomenex Ltd., Aschaffenburg, Germany). The solvent system consisted of 20 mm ammonium formate (pH 6) (mobile phase A) and a 50% (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and solution A (mobile phase B). The diastereomeric β-tyrosine derivatives were separated with a gradient of 25–35% B (Agilent 1100 series solvent delivery system) and detected with a ESI-MS Bruker HCT™ Plus mass spectrometer operating in manual MS/MS mode using positive ionization. OPA-NAC derivatives of commercially available (R)- and (S)-β-tyrosine (Peptech Corp., Burlington, MA) served as reference standards and were identified at retention times of 6 min (R) and 8 min (S) by their characteristic fragment ions (m/z = 314, 279, and 150, generated from the monoprotonated parent ion of m/z [β-tyrosine + OPA-NAC + H]+ = 443). Inactivation of cmdF—An internal 1061 bp fragment of the cmdF gene including a 5′ frameshift causing base pair (shown in italics), was generated by PCR using primers TAM-frame-up (5′-CTC CAA CCT GTC CCA TCT AC-3′) and TAM-del-down (5′-GAT GTT CAG GTA GTC GCA G-3′). The fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and the sequence confirmed by sequencing using primers M13uni (5′-TGT AAA ACG ACG GCC AGT-3′) and M13rev (5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG ACC-3′). The gene was excised as a HindIII-EcoRV fragment, and subcloned into vector pSUPHyg (18Rachid S. Krug D. Kochems I. Kunze B. Scharfe M. Blöcker H. Zabriski M. Müller R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 14: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar), creating the TAM inactivation plasmid, pSR10. The plasmid was then introduced into Cm c5 cells using biparental mating with Escherichia coli strain ET12567, as described previously (18Rachid S. Krug D. Kochems I. Kunze B. Scharfe M. Blöcker H. Zabriski M. Müller R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 14: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following selection on Pol0.3 agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin, putative cmdF- mutants were analyzed by PCR amplification of the integration region using primers TAM-frame-up and pSUP-EV (5′-GCATATAGCGCTAGCAGC-3′ (this primer anneals to a region 53 bp downstream of the EcoRV cloning site of the pSUPHyg plasmid). Cells of the cmdF- mutant strains were grown in 50 ml of MD1 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin for DNA isolation. Further verification of gene inactivation was performed by Northern blot analysis of cmdF transcription, essentially as described previously (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.A. Seidmann J.G. Smith J.A. Strahl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, NY1987Google Scholar, 21Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA from the Cm c5 WT and cmdF- mutant strains was extracted by the TRIzol (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A 1060 bp internal fragment of cmdF was generated by PCR using primers TAM-frame-up (5′-CTC CAA CCT GTC CAT CTA C-3′) and TAM-del-down (5′-GAT GTT CAG GTA GTC GCA G-3′), labeled with digoxigenin using the DIG-High Prime kit (Roche), and then used as a probe in the Northern blot. Hybridization was performed at 42 °C in formamide buffer with stringent washing at 68 °C followed by detection using CDP-Star (Roche Diagnostics) as substrate. As an internal control, the same northern membrane was hybridized with a ∼1.2 kb DIG-labeled PCR fragment of 16S rDNA from C. crocatus Cm c5 using the oligonucleotides Myxo-rDNA-F (5′-AAA GCC TGA CGC AGC-3′) and Myxo-rDNA-R (5′-CCT ACG GCT ACC TTG-3′). For analysis of chondramide production, the wild type and cmdF- mutant strains were inoculated into 100 ml of Pol03 medium supplemented with 1% XAD16 adsorber resin (Rohm & Haas, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) and 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and grown for 7 days at 30 °C in a rotary shaker at 180 rpm (Infors). The cells and resin were pelleted by centrifugation, extracted with methanol, and concentrated in vacuo. HPLC-MS analysis was performed on a reversed-phase Nucleodur C-18 column (125 × 2 mm/3 μm particle size; Macherey & Nagel), using an Agilent 1100 series instrument connected to a Bruker HCTplus ion trap. Complementation of the cmdF- Mutant—Complementation of the cmdF- mutant was performed by growing a cmdF- preculture in 40 ml of Pol03 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin for 7 days at 30 °C. The bacteria were subsequently inoculated into five conical flasks (250 ml) each containing 50 ml of Pol03 medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin. To these production cultures, (R,S)-β-tyrosine, (R)-β-tyrosine, (S)-β-tyrosine, and l-α-tyrosine were separately added in three portions (after 24, 48, and 72 h) to a final concentration of 1 mm. 1% XAD16 resin was then added to each culture and incubation continued for a further 96 h. Bacterial cells and resin were harvested and extracted with methanol. Overexpression and Purification of the Adenylation Domain CmdD-A7—The CmdD-A7 protein was expressed as a C-terminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST), as described previously (18Rachid S. Krug D. Kochems I. Kunze B. Scharfe M. Blöcker H. Zabriski M. Müller R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 14: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 cells transformed with pGEX-Ad-7 were grown overnight in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. 0.5 ml of this preculture was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was incubated at 37 °C until it reached an A600 of 0.6, and then expression was induced with 0.2 mm IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside). Growth was continued for 2 h at 30 °C before harvesting the cells by centrifugation. GST-CmdD-A7 was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, with on-column cleavage using PreScission Protease at 4 °C, according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). ATP-[32P]PPi Exchange Assay—An ATP-pyrophosphate (PPi) exchange was assayed using a previously reported procedure (22Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6163-6169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 25 °C in 100 μl of total volume containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm dATP, 150 nm CmdD-A7, 1 mm [32P]-pyrophosphate (0.5 μCi), and 2 mm of either l-α-tyrosine, (R,S)-β-tyrosine (Johnson Pump), (R)-β-tyrosine, (S)-β-tyrosine, l-tryptophan, l-phenylalanine, or l-methionine as substrates. Determination of the apparent Km value for (R)-β-tyrosine was performed by addition of 0.2, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mm (R)-β-tyrosine to the reactions. After a 15-min incubation period at 25 °C, the reactions were quenched by addition of an aqueous mixture of 1.6% (w/v) activated charcoal, 4.46% (w/v) tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 3.5% perchloric acid. The charcoal pellet was washed twice with the quenching mixture and submitted for liquid scintillation counting using a Packard BioScience Tri-Carb 2900 TR liquid scintillation counter. The reactions were typically performed in triplicate. The activation was plotted against substrate concentrations and fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by direct non-linear regression using the enzyme kinetics module of the SigmaPlot software suite (Systec Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Recombinant Production and Purification of CmdF—CmdF was expressed as a C-terminal fusion to GST. PCR amplification of the cmdF gene from chromosomal DNA of Cm c5 was carried out using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotides TAM-BamHI-up (5′-CGG ATC CAT GAA AAT CAC TGG CTC CAA-3′) (the BamHI site is underlined) and TAM-EcoRI-down (5′-AGG AAT TCC TCA GGA TGA CGC GGT CGT-3′) (the EcoRI site is underlined). The resulting 1612 bp product was purified, and single A overhangs were added using Taq polymerase. The fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and the fidelity of the PCR amplification was verified by sequence analysis. The insert was excised using restriction enzymes BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into expression vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) previously digested with BamHI and EcoRI, creating the expression plasmid pGEX-TAM. E. coli BL21 carrying the plasmid pGEX-TAM was used to inoculate 2 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. The preculture was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin at a 1:100 dilution and grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.6. 0.5 mm IPTG was added, and cultivation was continued for 6 h at 25 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were passed twice through a French pressure cell at ∼18000 psi, and the lysate centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein purification was carried out by affinity chromatography using GST-Sepharose, and the GST tag was cleaved with PreScission Protease at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). The purified protein was eluted in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217507) Google Scholar). Assay in Vitro for CmdF Aminomutase Activity—CmdF enzyme activity was assayed using 850 μg of purified protein in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.8) at 30 °C, using 2 mm l-α-tyrosine, as described previously (14Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To investigate the formation of β-tyrosine, a 50-μl aliquot from the assay was derivatized with OPA-NAC reagent (19Buck R.H. Krummen K. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 387: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of the assay was mixed with 200-μl reagent for 10 min at room temperature and directly submitted to HPLC analysis as described in (24Berner M. Krug D. Bihlmaier C. Vente A. Müller R. Bechthold A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2666-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Retention times for the amino acid OPA-NAC derivatives were l-α-tyrosine, 16.5 min; (R)-β-tyrosine, 12 min; (S)-β-tyrosine, 15 min. (R)-β-Tyrosine Is Incorporated into the Chondramides—Comparison of the chondramides to the known structures of the jaspamides (3Zabriskie T.M. Klocke J.A. Ireland C.M. Marcus A.H. Molinski T.F. Faulkner D.J. Xu C. Clardy J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 3123-3124Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar) suggested that the configuration of the β-tyrosine in the chondramides should be (R). To confirm this, however, hydrolysis of chondramide D was performed by the addition of HCl. HPLC-MS-MS analysis of the chondramide D hydrolysate following chiral derivatization showed unambiguously that (R)-β-tyrosine was incorporated into the molecule (Fig. 1B). This experiment also revealed that the commercially available (R)- and (S)-β-tyrosines used in this study both contained trace amounts of the opposite enantiomer. Inactivation of the Tyrosine Aminomutase Gene and Complementation Studies—The biosynthesis and incorporation of (S)-β-tyrosine has been investigated in detail for C-1027 biosynthesis (12Van Lanen S.G.

Chem. 2006; 281: 29633-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but to our knowledge, there is no information on the origin of the (R)-β-tyrosine building block found in the chondramides and jaspamides. We hypothesized, however, that (R)-β-tyrosine could be produced directly from l-tyrosine by a tyrosine aminomutase similar to SgcC4 (13Christenson S.D. Liu W. Toney M.D. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 6062-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed, sequence analysis of the downstream region of the cmdA–cmdD operon revealed the presence of a gene, cmdF, whose gene product showed convincing homology to SgcC4 (41% identity and 57% similarity on the amino acid level). Neither gene exhibited homology to the known class of aminomutase enzymes including radical-based enzymes and ATP- or 4-pyridoxalphosphate dependent enzymes (26Kozarich J.W. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 123-128PubMed Google Scholar, 27Petrovich R.M. Ruzicka F.J. Reed G.H. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10774-10781Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Chen D. Ruzicka F.J. Frey P.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 539-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but both are homologous to a large number of histidine ammonium and phenylalanine lyases of prokaryotic origin. CmdF also contains the signature Ala-Ser-Gly motif characteristic of the ammonium lyases and thus is likely to use the prosthetic MIO group in catalysis (Fig. 2) (15Poppe L. Rétey J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 117: 3734-3754Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, both CmdF and SgcC4 incorporate a strictly conserved glutamine residue (Gln-431 in CmdF and Gln-442 in SgcC4), which is characteristic of ammonium lyases which use phenylalanine or tyrosine as substrates (24Berner M. Krug D. Bihlmaier C. Vente A. Müller R. Bechthold A. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2666-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29Calabrese J.C. Jordan D.B. Boodhoo A. Sariaslani S. Vannelli T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11403-11416Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggested that CmdF was likely to be a tyrosine aminomutase, belonging to the ammonium-lyase family. Thus, we evaluated its putative role in the provision of (R)-β-tyrosine by targeted gene inactivation. Inactivation of the cmdF gene was achieved via integration by homologous recombination of the inactivation plasmid pSR10 into the genome of the wild type Cm c5 strain. Polar effects on other genes in the cluster were judged unlikely, as cmdF appeared to be located at the end of an operon (Fig. 3, A and B). Verification of the cmdF- mutants was obtained by PCR using primer TAM-del-up and vector-specific primer pSUP-EV; a 1135 bp fragment was amplified from genomic DNA of the cmdF- mutant, whereas no PCR fragment was generated from wild type genomic DNA. Furthermore, the absence of the cmdF transcript from total RNA of the cmdF- mutant strain was confirmed by Northern blot (Fig. 3C). HPLC-MS analysis of methanolic extracts from production cultures of the cmdF- mutant revealed that the strain no longer produced the chondramides (Fig. 3, D–G) (data for the wild type compounds: chondramide A (Rt = 15.9 min, m/z [M + H]+ = 647); chondramide C (Rt = 16.7 min, m/z [M + H]+ = 617); chondramide B (Rt = 16.9 min, m/z [M + H]+ = 681); chondramide D (Rt = 18.0 min, m/z [M + H]+= 651)) (18Rachid S. Krug D. Kochems I. Kunze B. Scharfe M. Blöcker H. Zabriski M. Müller R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 14: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We next attempted to complement the cmdF- mutant by addition of 1 mm racemic (R,S)-β-tyrosine, (R)-β-tyrosine, (S)-β-tyrosine, and l-α-tyrosine to the production cultures. This choice of substrates allowed us simultaneously to probe the stereochemistry of β-tyrosine incorporation into the chondramides. HPLC-MS analysis of methanolic extracts showed that chondramide production was restored only when (R,S)-β-tyrosine (data not shown) or (R)-β-tyrosine were supplied (Fig. 4). Chondramides were not observed in the cultures following addition of l-α-tyrosine, but a small amount of chondramide D was detected upon supplementation with (S)-β-tyrosine (Fig. 4, B and F). However, we attribute biosynthesis of this metabolite to the presence of trace amounts of (R)-β-tyrosine in the commercial sample of (S)-β-tyrosine (Figs. 1B and 4). As inactivation of CmdF resulted in the loss of chondramide production, and the mutation could be complemented by addition of (R)-β-tyrosine, our results implied that CmdF is directly responsible for biosynthesis of this building block. The CmdF Protein Converts l-Tyrosine to β-Tyrosine in Vitro—To confirm the putative activity of CmdF in vitro, CmdF was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 as C-terminal fusion with GST. Purification of CmdF by glutathione affinity chromatography, followed by on-column cleavage using PreScission Protease, yielded ∼3 mg/liter of culture. The purified CmdF protein (calculated Mr, 57309 Da) migrated during SDS-PAGE analysis with the expected size (Fig. 5A). The purified enzyme was assayed for aminomutase activity by incubation of CmdF with l-tyrosine, using conditions previously reported for the investigation of aminomutase and ammonium-lyase-type enzymes (14Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Products were detected using diode array detector-coupled HPLC separation following chiral derivatization, and product identity was verified by comparison to commercially available reference compounds (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of assay samples taken at multiple time points during a 22-h incubation revealed that CmdF was able to convert l-α-tyrosine into β-tyrosine in the absence of added cofactors (Fig. 5B). The primary product of the reaction was (R)-β-tyrosine, but (S)-β-tyrosine was produced at later time points. Formation of pHCA was also observed, consuming about 30% of the substrate l-tyrosine in the course of the above assay (data not shown). No activity was observed with d-tyrosine or l-histidine as substrates. As (R)-β-tyrosine is the kinetically preferred product of CmdF, these data confirm our expectation that the enzyme can produce (R)-β-tyrosine directly from the precursor l-tyrosine. Taken together, these observations suggest that CmdF and SgcC4 accomplish the synthesis of β-tyrosine using a common catalytic mechanism (14Christenson S.D. Wu W. Spies M.A. Shen B. Toney M.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12708-12718Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and therefore, that CmdF represents the second member of a novel class of aminomutase enzymes. The essential difference between the enzymes is the facial selectivity, with CmdF generating (R)-β-tyrosine and SgcC4 producing (S)-β-tyrosine from a common intermediate. The basis for the control of stereochemistry during ammonia addition is presently unclear but should be illuminated by high-resolution structural information on these enzymes. The CmdD-A7 Adenylation Domain Preferentially Activates (R)-β-Tyrosine—The A domains of NRPS multienzymes are responsible for selection of the amino acid incorporated by each module in the NRPS. Therefore, if the (R)-β-tyrosine of CmdF is directly incorporated into the chondramides, the A domain in the respective module (CmdD module 7, Fig. 6) should exhibit a strong preference for this substrate. Similar studies have recently been performed with the A domain SgcC1 of the C-1027 pathway, demonstrating a 25-fold preference (kcat/Km) for (S)-β-tyrosine over the (R) isomer (25Van Lanen S.G. Lin S.J. Dorrestein P.C. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29633-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Therefore, we aimed directly to evaluate the specificity of recombinant CmdD-A7 toward a panel of potential substrates, including both (R)- and (S)-β-tyrosine. Recombinant production of GST-tagged CmdD-A7 domain in E. coli BL21 was achieved using the expression plasmid pGEX-Ad-7 as described (18Rachid S. Krug D. Kochems I. Kunze B. Scharfe M. Blöcker H. Zabriski M. Müller R. Chem. Biol. 2006; 14: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the purified A domain was investigated using the standard amino acid-dependent ATP-PPi exchange assay (22Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6163-6169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Incubation with a panel of amino acids (Fig. 7A) in the presence of [32P]-pyrophosphate showed that (R)-β-tyrosine gave the highest activity (set to 100% in Fig. 7A). Only 0.1–1% of this activity was observed in the absence of enzyme. Incubation with (R,S)-β-tyrosine resulted in 24% relative activity followed by l-α-tyrosine (22%), phenylalanine (15%), (S)-β-tyrosine (10%), and tryptophan (6%). Activity toward methionine was essentially at background levels. By varying the amount of (R)-β-tyrosine (0.2–2 mm), we estimated its Km value to be 1.2 mm (Fig. 7B) (it was not possible to further increase the (R)-β-tyrosine concentration because of its poor solubility, and therefore this figure represents the maximum value for the Km). This value is significantly higher than that determined for SgcC1 with (S)-β-tyrosine (3.2 μm) but within the range of Km values reported for A domains toward their native substrates (25Van Lanen S.G. Lin S.J. Dorrestein P.C. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29633-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6843-6850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, as required by the biosynthetic model, CmdD-A7 exhibits a very strong preference for (R)-β-tyrosine over other potential substrates. These data argue against an alternative model for chondramide biosynthesis in which CmdD-A7 activates l-tyrosine followed by transformation of the peptidyl carrier protein-bound residue to (R)-β-tyrosine. Analysis of the specificity pockets of A domains has resulted in the identification of eight residues, which can be used to predict the activation specificity (31Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 32Challis G.L. Ravel J. Townsend C.A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 211-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Comparison between these selectivity-determining residues in CmdD-A7 and SgcC1 reveals substantial divergence (DGSTITAV and DPAQLMLI, respectively), which may account for the differences both in stereospecificity toward β-tyrosine as well as the strength of substrate binding. On the basis of multiple sequence alignment of A domains, it has also been proposed that the replacement of Ala or Gly by Pro in the second position of the specificity code may alter the specificity of the domain to favor β-amino acids (25Van Lanen S.G. Lin S.J. Dorrestein P.C. Kelleher N.L. Shen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29633-29640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, CmdD-A7 does not contain this “signature replacement”, which suggests that care must be taken in drawing conclusions from the limited available structure-activity relationships for A domains. Clearly, a crystal structure of a β-amino acid activating A domain would shed light on the molecular basis for selective activation of β-amino acids.

https://openalex.org/W2008239057,"We have investigated conformational changes of the purified maltose ATP-binding cassette transporter (MalFGK2) upon binding of ATP. The transport complex is composed of a heterodimer of the hydrophobic subunits MalF and MalG constituting the translocation pore and of a homodimer of MalK, representing the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit. Substrate is delivered to the transporter in complex with periplasmic maltose-binding protein (MalE). Cross-linking experiments with a variant containing an A85C mutation within the Q-loop of each MalK monomer indicated an ATP-induced shortening of the distance between both monomers. Cross-linking caused a substantial inhibition of MalE-maltose-stimulated ATPase activity. We further demonstrated that a mutation affecting the “catalytic carboxylate” (E159Q) locks the MalK dimer in the closed state, whereas a transporter containing the “ABC signature” mutation Q140K permanently resides in the resting state. Cross-linking experiments with variants containing the A85C mutation combined with cysteine substitutions in the conserved EAA motifs of MalF and MalG, respectively, revealed close proximity of these residues in the resting state. The formation of a MalK-MalG heterodimer remained unchanged upon the addition of ATP, indicating that MalG-EAA moves along with MalK during dimer closure. In contrast, the yield of MalK-MalF dimers was substantially reduced. This might be taken as further evidence for asymmetric functions of both EAA motifs. Cross-linking also caused inhibition of ATPase activity, suggesting that transporter function requires conformational changes of both EAA motifs. Together, our data support ATP-driven MalK dimer closure and reopening as crucial steps in the translocation cycle of the intact maltose transporter and are discussed with respect to a current model.

They are found in all organisms from bacteria to humans, and dysfunction is often associated with disease in humans, such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, or Stargardt's macular dystrophy (1Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. 2003; (, Academic Press, Inc., New York)Google Scholar). ABC transporters share a common architectural organization comprising two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the translocation pathway and two hydrophilic nucleotide binding (ABC) domains (NBDs) that hydrolyze ATP. In fact, in most prokaryote importers, TMDs and NBDs are expressed as separate protein subunits, whereas in most export systems of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, they are usually fused into a single polypeptide chain (2Dassa E. Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. 2003: 3-35Google Scholar). The ABC domains are characterized by a set of Walker A and B motifs that are involved in nucleotide binding and by the unique “LSGGQ” signature sequence (3Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several mostly prokaryotic NBDs have been reported that largely agree on the overall fold (reviewed in Refs. 4Schmitt L. Tampé R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 5Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol.

Accordingly, the cassette can be divided into a RecA-like subdomain encompassing both Walker motifs and a specific α-helical subdomain comprising the LSGGQ motif. Both subdomains are joined by the Q-loop containing a conserved glutamine residue that binds to the Mg2+ ion and attacking water. Structural and biochemical evidence have further revealed that in the physiologically relevant NBD dimer, the nucleotide binding site of one monomer is completed by the LSGGQ motif of the opposing monomer (7Hopfner K-N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 41303-41306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Further progress in understanding the structural organization of ABC transporters was achieved with the high resolution structures of complete transporters (13Locher K. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 14Dawson R.J.P. Locher K.P. Nature. 2006; 443: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 15Pinkett H.W. Lee A.T.

Nature. 2007; 446: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). These structures have provided some insight into the interactions between the NBDs and the TMDs, although the means by which ATP-dependent conformational changes of the ABC domains are transmitted to the TMDs to affect substrate translocation are still poorly understood (5Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61 (.): 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The ABC transporter mediating the uptake of maltose and maltodextrins in Escherichia coli/Salmonella typhimurium is one of the best characterized systems and thus serves as a model for studying the molecular mechanism by which ABC importers exert their functions (reviewed in Refs. 6Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar and 17Schneider E. Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. 2003: 157-185Google Scholar). The transporter is composed of an extracellular (periplasmic) receptor, the maltose-binding protein (MalE), and a membrane-bound complex (MalFGK2), comprising the pore-forming hydrophobic subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of the ABC subunit, MalK. Association of the MalK subunits with MalF and MalG requires the so-called “EAA” sequence motifs (consensus EAAX3GX9IXLP) that are conserved in the last cytoplasmic loop of TMDs of ABC import systems (18Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Hunke S. Mourez M. Jéhanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol.

MalK and closely related ABC subunits belonging to the CUT1 and MOI subfamilies of ABC importers (2Dassa E. Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F.

Microbiol. 2001; 152: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) contain a unique C-terminal extension, which in the crystal structures of MalK (9Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and CysA (21Scheffel F. Demmer U. Warkentin E. Huölsmann A. Schneider E. Ermler U. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2953-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) contribute substantially to monomer-monomer contacts. The MalK structures further revealed that binding of ATP causes the nucleotide binding domains to close (9Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and that ATP hydrolysis is required for resetting the system to the resting state (22Lu G. Westbrooks J.M. Davidson A.L. Chen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17969-17974Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Closing of the MalK dimer in solution is consistent with cross-linking data obtained with the intact transporter in crude membrane vesicles (19Hunke S. Mourez M. Jéhanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence has given rise to the notion that ATP binding to the MalK dimer might be communicated via its Q-loops to the EAA motifs of MalFG (18Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Hunke S. Mourez M. Jéhanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In support of this view, the crystal structure of the vitamin B12 transporter of E. coli (BtuCD) not only revealed close contact between the Q-loop of BtuD and the EAA (or L) loops of BtuC but also contacts of the Q-loop with atoms in the ATP binding site (13Locher K. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a molecular dynamics simulation suggests that conformational switching of the Q-loop may mediate communication between the TMDs and the catalytic sites (5Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61 (.): 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These and other data have led to a model according to which transport of maltose is initiated by interaction of liganded MalE (23Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) with the nucleotide-free MalFGK2 complex at the extracellular (periplasmic) side, causing ATP binding to the MalK subunits and subsequent closing of the MalK dimer. ATP-driven dimer formation is thought to represents one possibility for the power stroke of ABC transporters (8Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The monomer-dimer transition would be coupled to conformational changes in the transmembrane domains for which evidence has recently been presented (24Daus M.L. Landmesser H. Schlosser A. Muöller P. Herrmann A. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3856-3865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of one ATP molecule might result in simultaneous opening of the binding protein (25Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and of a gate at the periplasmic side, thereby giving the substrate molecule access to a translocation pathway through the membrane. Hydrolysis of the second ATP would bring the system back to the resting state. The concomitant separation of the NBDs is discussed as a second possibility for the power stroke of the system (8Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have investigated ATP-dependent conformational changes of the purified MalFGK2 complex. By employing site-directed cross-linking, we determined distance changes between Ala-85 in both Q-loops of the MalK subunits upon the addition of ATP (Fig. 1A). The observed motional changes were used as “molecular pointers” to characterize the conformational state of transport-defective and binding protein-independent variants. The functional consequences of covalently linking the Q-loops to each other or the EAA motifs of MalFG to the helical subdomain of MalK (Fig. 1, A and B) were analyzed by monitoring MalE/maltose-stimulated ATPase activity of the complexes. Our results suggest that closing and reopening of the MalK dimer and conformational changes of the EAA motifs are crucial features within the catalytic cycle of the intact transporter. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain JM109 (Stratagene) was used as a general host for the plasmids listed in Table 1.

For MIANS modification studies, transport complexes were labeled in buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 0.01% β-d-dodecylmaltoside) by incubation at 4 °C with a 4-fold molar excess of MIANS for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and excess MIANS was removed from the protein sample by a PD10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) or by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Preparation of Vanadate-trapped Complexes—Wild type and mutant transport complexes were treated with vanadate as described in Ref. 25Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar. Briefly, vanadate was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to a mixture containing 2,5 μm MalFGK2 complex, 5 μm MalE, 4 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 mm maltose in buffer 1, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. For MIANS labeling, the samples were desalted by passage through a PD10 column. Stable association of MalE with the trapped complexes was confirmed using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Preparation of Proteoliposomes—MalE/maltose-loaded proteoliposomes were prepared as in Ref. 28Landmesser H. Stein A. Bluöschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. When cross-linked complexes were incorporated into liposomes, DTT was omitted from all buffers. Cross-linking with Cu(1,10-phenanthroline)2SO4 (CuPhe)—Complex protein (2.5 μm) was incubated in buffer 1 with 3 mm CuSO4 and 9 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (from Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by adding 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. For ATPase measurements of cross-linked complexes, samples were passed through a PD-10 desalting column to remove CuPhe. Samples treated with DTT were also passed through PD 10 columns. For experiments with proteoliposomes protein samples were cross-linked prior to reconstitution. Cross-linking with Homobifunctional Sulfonate Cross-linkers—Sulfonate cross-linkers were purchased from Toronto Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). The following cross-linkers were used: 1,2-ethanediyl-bis(methanethiosulfonate) (EBS), 1,6-hexandiyl-bis(methanethiosulfonate) (HBS), and 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecan-1,17-diyl-bis(methanethiosulfonate) (PBS). According to Ref. 29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, the approximate spacer lengths are 5.2 Å (EBS), 10.4 Å (HBS), and 24.7 Å (PBS). Reactions were started by adding the respective cross-linker (final concentration 1 mm) from freshly prepared stock solutions (100 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide) to the indicated protein samples (2.5 μm) in buffer 1. After 20 min at room temperature, reactions were terminated by adding 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. ATPase Assay—Hydrolysis of ATP was assayed in microtiter plates essentially as described in Ref. 28Landmesser H. Stein A. Bluöschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Dulley and Grieve (30Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% polyacrylamide gels as described in Ref. 28Landmesser H. Stein A. Bluöschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Fluorescent bands on gels were visualized in distilled water over an ultraviolet light source and recorded using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc EQ image system (Munich, Germany). Quantification of protein bands by densitometric scanning was carried using the GelScan Pro 5.0 software (BioSciTec GmbH). The MalK(C40S)F*G* Complex Variant—In the initial stage of this work, we set out to perform the intended cross-linking experiments and functional analyses with the purified MalK(A85C) variant of an otherwise Cys-less transport complex. However, purification by an established protocol (28Landmesser H. Stein A. Bluöschke B. Brinkmann M. Hunke S. Schneider E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) turned out to be highly insufficient due to unforeseen poor overproduction. Then, during the course of labeling complex variants with the fluorophore MIANS, we observed that in wild type MalK only Cys-40 reacted with the fluorophore, whereas the remaining cysteine residues (Cys-350 and Cys-360) were virtually inaccessible to the label (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 24Daus M.L. Landmesser H. Schlosser A. Muöller P. Herrmann A. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3856-3865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The complex variant MalK(C40S)F*G* (asterisks denote Cys-less variants) could be overproduced and purified in amounts comparable with wild type and exhibited similar MalE/maltose-stimulated ATPase activity both in proteoliposomes and in detergent solution (see Table 3). Moreover, ATP hydrolysis was markedly inhibited (>80%) by vanadate (not shown). Vanadate as a phosphate analogue can lock the complex in a so-called “transition state” by trapping ADP in one binding site and thereby preventing a new cycle of hydrolysis (25Chen J. Sharma S.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is well established that these properties can be taken as evidence for tight coupling of ATP hydrolysis to maltose transport (23Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Together, we reasoned that it would be promising to construct the MalK variants studied in this work on the MalK(C40S) background.TABLE 3ATPase activities of maltose transport complex variantsComplex variantATPase activityaSpecific ATPase activities of purified transport complex variants in detergent solution (0.08 mg/ml) measured in the absence and presence of purified MalE (0.2 mg/ml) and maltose (10 μm).No addition+MalE/maltose+MalE/maltose + CuPhe+MalE/maltose + CuPhe + DTTμmol Pi/min/mgMalKFG (wild type)In liposomes0.111.3NDNDIn detergent solution0.060.35NDNDMalK(C40S)F*G*In liposomes0.131.11.0bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.1.0bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.In detergent solution0.020.310.320.31MalK(C40S,A85C)F*G*In liposomes0.180.740.22bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.0.68bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.In detergent solution0.060.170.080.13MalK(C40S,A85C,E159Q)F*G*In liposomes0.020.02NDNDIn detergent solution0.030.02NDNDMalK(C40S,A85C,Q140K)F*G*In detergent solution0.020.03NDNDMalK(C40S,A85C)F500*G*In liposomes0.60.76NDNDIn detergent solution0.440.52NDNDMalK(C40S,V117C)F*(S403C)G*In liposomes0.120.980.43bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.0.9bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.In detergent solution0.040.180.030.14MalK(C40S,V117C)F*G*(A192C)In liposomes01.10.21bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.0.92bComplexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes.In detergent solution0.210.650.230.59a Specific ATPase activities of purified transport complex variants in detergent solution (0.08 mg/ml) measured in the absence and presence of purified MalE (0.2 mg/ml) and maltose (10 μm).b Complexes were first cross-linked in detergent solution and subsequently incorporated into liposomes. Open table in a new tab ATP Binding Reduces the Distance between the Q-loops in the MalK Dimer—The purified complex variant MalK(C40S,A85C)F*G* was cross-linked in detergent solution in the absence of ATP, in an ATP-bound state, and after vanadate-trapping. We used homobifunctional sulfonate cross-linkers, covering distances of ∼5.2 Å (EBS), 10.4 Å (HBS), and 24.7 Å (PBS). As shown in Fig. 2A in the absence of ligand, a MalK dimer was formed only with PBS. In the presence of ATP, a cross-link product was observed with all three linkers, suggesting that the Ala-85 residues of both monomers have approached to a distance of apparently 5.2 Å. No cross-link products were found in the absence of chemical linkers (not shown). The observation that the cross-link reactions were significant but not complete might be due to limited temporal reactivity of the water-insoluble homobifunctional chemical linkers. Nonetheless, th"
https://openalex.org/W2023561018,"Two general pathways of mRNA decay have been characterized in yeast. Both start with deadenylation. The major pathway then proceeds via cap hydrolysis and 5′-exonucleolytic degradation whereas the minor pathway consists of 3′-exonucleolytic decay followed by hydrolysis of the remaining cap structure. In higher eukaryotes, these pathways of mRNA decay are believed to be conserved but have not been well characterized. We have investigated the decay of the hsp70 mRNA in Drosophila Schneider cells. As shown by the use of reporter constructs, rapid deadenylation of this mRNA is directed by its 3′-untranslated region. The main deadenylase is the CCR4·NOT complex; the PAN nuclease makes a lesser contribution. Heat shock prevents deadenylation not only of the hsp70 but also of bulk mRNA. A completely deadenylated capped hsp70 mRNA decay intermediate accumulates transiently and is degraded via cap hydrolysis and 5′-decay. Thus, decapping is a slow step in the degradation pathway. Cap hydrolysis is also inhibited during heat shock. Degradation of reporter RNAs from the 3′-end became detectable only upon inhibition of 5′-decay and thus represents a minor decay pathway. Because two reporter RNAs and at least two endogenous mRNAs were degraded primarily from the 5′-end with cap hydrolysis as a slow step, this pathway appears to be of general importance for mRNA decay in Drosophila.

Because two reporter RNAs and at least two endogenous mRNAs were degraded primarily from the 5′-end with cap hydrolysis as a slow step, this pathway appears to be of general importance for mRNA decay in Drosophila. A characteristic feature of mRNA is its rapid turnover, permitting a continuous qualitative and quantitative adjustment of protein synthesis according to physiological needs. The pathways of eukaryotic mRNA degradation have been characterized mostly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 2Meyer S. Temme C. Wahle E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The decay of all mRNAs examined in these cells starts with deadenylation, i.e. exonucleolytic shortening of the poly(A) tail. The second step of decay does not occur until the poly(A) tail has been shortened to about a dozen nucleotides (3Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In the major pathway, this second step is hydrolysis of the 5′-cap (4Hsu C.L. Stevens A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 6Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cap hydrolysis results in free m7GDP and a 5′-monophosphate left on the mRNA and is catalyzed by the Dcp2p subunit of the Dcp1p·Dcp2p heterodimer (7Cougot N. van Dijk E. Babajko S. Séraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 436-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In vivo, the activity of the decapping enzyme is enhanced by several other proteins (8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The decapped RNA is degraded by the 5′-exonuclease Xrn1p (4Hsu C.L. Stevens A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4826-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 5Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In a minor pathway, the deadenylated RNA is degraded from the 3′-end by the exosome (9Jacobs Anderson J.S. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) before the remaining oligonucleotide is decapped by the enzyme Dcs1p, liberating m7GMP (10Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Liu H. Rodgers N.D. Jiao X. Kiledjian M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4699-4708Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar).The deadenylation-dependent decapping pathway of mRNA decay is in a fundamental competition with translation (8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Two proteins required for cap hydrolysis in vivo, Pat1p and the RNA helicase Dhh1p, act by shifting the balance in favor of cap hydrolysis at the expense of translation (12Coller J. Parker R. Cell. 2005; 122: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Because the poly(A) tail is involved in translation initiation via the poly(A)-binding protein, deadenylation can be seen as promoting decapping and decay by removing the mRNA from the translated pool (13Tharun S. Parker R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1075-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In fact, the inhibitor of decapping is the poly(A)-binding protein, not the poly(A) tail per se (8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 14Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).In animal cells, the decay of most mRNAs analyzed is also initiated by deadenylation (15Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 16Shyu A.-B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 17Yamashita A.

Subsequent decay of the deadenylated message is thought to proceed via the two pathways analyzed in yeast, mostly because the relevant proteins are conserved, but experimental data on the later steps of mRNA decay are relatively scarce. Based mainly on in vitro evidence, several groups have argued that the exosomal 3′-decay pathway may be the predominant mode of decay of unstable mammalian mRNAs (10Wang Z. Kiledjian M.

Behm-Ansmant I. Izaurralde E. Nat Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Furthermore, microRNA (miRNA) 4The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich element; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; Ab, antibody; nt, nucleotide; RNP, ribonucleoprotein.4The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; UTR, untranslated region; ARE, AU-rich element; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; Ab, antibody; nt, nucleotide; RNP, ribonucleoprotein.-induced mRNA destabilization in Drosophila Schneider cells requires Dcp1·Dcp2-dependent decapping (27Behm-Ansmant I.

However, the relative contributions of the two decay pathways to overall mRNA decay remain unknown, and decay intermediates have been analyzed only to a limited extent.Deadenylation is the rate-limiting step in the decay of most mRNAs. Several arguments support this view. First, deadenylation occurs by continuous shortening of the poly(A) tail throughout the lifetime of the RNA; the process can be easily followed in vivo even for unstable RNAs. However, once deadenylation has proceeded beyond a critical limit, the RNA usually disappears rapidly without detectable intermediates, showing that all subsequent steps are fast (28Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Second, unstable RNAs are deadenylated faster than stable RNAs, and sequence manipulations affecting the overall rate of decay change the rate of deadenylation in a similar manner (8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 15Wilson T. Treisman R. Nature. 1988; 336: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 16Shyu A.-B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Third, when a normally unstable RNA is stabilized because of a physiological stimulus, the rate of its deadenylation is reduced (33Dean J.L.E. Sarsfield S.J. Tsounakou E. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39470-39476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Winzen R. Gowrishankar G. Bollig F. Redich N. Resch K. Holtmann H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4835-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Fourth, kinetic modeling suggests that changes in the rate of deadenylation have the greatest influence on the overall stability of the RNA (35Cao D. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1192-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For some RNAs cap hydrolysis is a slow step, leading to the accumulation of a fully deadenylated, capped decay intermediate (3Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Slow decapping is often associated with slow deadenylation (8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar).The main enzyme responsible for deadenylation in yeast as well as in mammals and in Drosophila is the CCR4·NOT complex (17Yamashita A. Chang T.-C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 36Tucker M.

Tarun S.Z. Boeck R. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5744-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 40Boeck R. Tarun S. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A. Müller-Auer S. Sachs A.B. J. Biol.

In yeast, this enzyme catalyzes the residual deadenylation observed upon inactivation of the CCR4·NOT complex (36Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, PAN is thought to act before the CCR4·NOT complex, catalyzing a rapid initial shortening of the poly(A) tail (17Yamashita A. Chang T.-C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 42Brown C.E. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4082-4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), is conserved in most eukaryotes, but not in yeast and in Drosophila. PARN has been implicated in the decay of several unstable RNAs (21Chou C.-F. Mulky A. Maitra S. Lin W.-J. Gherzi R. Kappes J. Chen C.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3695-3706Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 46Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3798-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), but its general role in mRNA turnover remains poorly defined (17Yamashita A. Chang T.-C. Yamashita Y. Zhu W. Zhong Z. Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1054-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar).RNA elements promoting rapid deadenylation and decay are often located in the 3′-UTR, and the so-called AU-rich elements (AREs) are the best-studied class among them (28Chen C.-Y. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Destabilizing sequences are bound by specific proteins, which can directly recruit deadenylases and other decay enzymes (21Chou C.-F. Mulky A. Maitra S. Lin W.-J. Gherzi R. Kappes J. Chen C.-Y. Mol.

Recently, miRNAs have also been found to be able to induce mRNA deadenylation (27Behm-Ansmant I. Rehwinkel J. Doerks T. Stark A. Bork P. Izaurralde E. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1885-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 51Jing Q. Huang S. Guth S. Zarubin T. Motoyama A. Chen J. Di Padova F. Lin S.-C. Gram H. Han J.

Science. 2006; 312: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar).The hsp70 mRNA of Drosophila is very unstable at normal growth temperatures with a functional half-life of 15–30 min suggested by indirect measurements (54Petersen R. Lindquist S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Rapid degradation of the hsp70 message requires its 3′-UTR (55Petersen R.B. Lindquist S. Cell Regulation. 1989; 1: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Upon heat shock, the RNA is stabilized at least 10-fold (54Petersen R. Lindquist S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This contributes to the rapid and massive (more than 1000-fold (56Lindquist S. Petersen R. Enzyme. 1990; 44: 147-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)) induction of HSP70 protein synthesis. During recovery from heat shock, the normal instability of the message is restored, and production of HSP70 protein ceases (54Petersen R. Lindquist S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 72: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 55Petersen R.B. Lindquist S. Cell Regulation. 1989; 1: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The first step in hsp70 mRNA degradation during recovery is its deadenylation catalyzed by the CCR4·NOT complex (38Temme C. Zaessinger S. Simonelig M. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2862-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 57Dellavalle R.P. Petersen R. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3646-3659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An unusual, transient but pronounced accumulation of a completely deadenylated RNA species is also observed both during heat shock and recovery. Two observations suggest that deadenylation is inhibited by heat shock: First, during heat shock, the fraction of polyadenylated hsp70 RNA increases with increasing temperature. Second, deadenylation is faster after a mild heat shock than after a severe heat shock, and deadenylation during recovery from a severe heat shock is faster if the cells have been preconditioned by a mild heat shock (57Dellavalle R.P. Petersen R. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3646-3659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the temperature dependence of deadenylation and its dependence on 3′-UTR sequences have not been tested directly.We have examined the decay pathway of the hsp70 mRNA in Drosophila Schneider cells. We find that this RNA is degraded via rapid deadenylation controlled by its 3′-UTR, followed by slow cap hydrolysis and 5′-decay. Exosome-dependent 3′-decay plays a minor role in the degradation of the hsp70 mRNA. Both deadenylation and decapping are inhibited during heat shock. The 5′-decay pathway is also important for the degradation of several other mRNAs examined in Schneider cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells were grown as semi-adherent layers at 25 °C in Schneider′s Insect Medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mix (Invitrogen). Stably transformed cell lines were generated by calcium phosphate transfection and hygromycin B selection according to procedures suggested by Invitrogen (Drosophila Expression System Version C handbook) and grown in medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B. Expression of reporter gene constructs was induced at 25 °C by addition of 500 μm CuSO4. Transcription was stopped by addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma).Heat shock was performed by incubation of cells in a temperature-controlled water bath at the temperature indicated. For induction of endogenous hsp70 or hsp83 RNA and analysis of their decay during subsequent recovery, heat shock was at 35.5 or 36 °C, followed by recovery at 25 °C. For the analysis of RNAs during heat shock, 36 or 37 °C were used. No significant differences were observed between these conditions. It should be noted that the metallothionein promoter driving the reporter constructs (see below) is nearly inactive under heat shock conditions. Thus, when actinomycin D was added some time after heat shock, the distribution of RNA decay intermediates at the time of actinomycin D addition reflected a period of net decay preceding the addition of the drug. Apart from that, no difference in RNA decay was seen when actinomycin D was added at the time of heat shock or 30 min later.Plasmids—The reporter plasmids were constructed as follows: The mutated RNP domain of bovine PABPN1 (Met161–Thr258 with the mutations Y175A, K213Q, and F215A) (58Kühn U. Nemeth A. Meyer S. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16916-16925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with the primers GGTACCATGTCCATTGAGGAGAAGAT introducing a KpnI restriction site (underlined) at the beginning of the open reading frame and GTCGACTGTTGTGCTGATGCCTGGT introducing a SalI site (underlined) at the end. The 3′-UTR and additional downstream sequences of the distal hsp70 gene of the 87A7 locus (gene Ab, GenBank™ accession number CG18743 nucleotides 1–243, 1 being the first nucleotide behind the stop codon) were amplified from genomic D. melanogaster DNA (strain Oregon 1) with primers HSP70 Sal (5′-GTCGACTAAGGCCAAAGA-3′), binding at the border of the open reading frame and the 3′-UTR and containing the naturally occuring SalI site immediately 5′ of the stop codon, and HSP70 DSE (5′-GAATTCAGACTTTCAAAAGTCTACAA-3′), introducing a new EcoRI site at the 3′-end. The 3′-UTR plus downstream sequences of the Drosophila adh gene (GenBank™ accession number X78384, nucleotides 2926–3226) were amplified from a plasmid clone (a gift of Saverio Brogna) with the primers ADH sense Sal (5′-GTCGACTAAGAAGTGATAATCCCA-3′), which introduces a SalI restriction site followed by a stop codon at the 5′-end, and ADH DSE (5′-GAATTCTTCTTTCTAACCGCTTTCA-3′), which introduces an EcoRI restriction site at the 3′-end of the PCR product. All fragments were cloned into a pBS-SK vector (Stratagene) opened with SmaI. The RNP fragment was cut out with KpnI/SalI, purified, and ligated into the KpnI/SalI-opened plasmids already containing the HSP70 and ADH 3′-UTRs. The SalI site introduces the additional sequence Val-Thr at the C terminus of the RNP domain. The complete RNP-UTR fragments were then cut out with KpnI and EcoRI and ligated into the KpnI/EcoRI-opened pMT/V5 expression vector (version A, Invitrogen), from which a BclI fragment containing the SV40 poly(A) signal had been deleted. Point mutations in the ARE sequences of the HSP70 reporter plasmid were introduced in two sequential reactions via the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). The sequence was verified after each round of mutagenesis.RNA Interference—dsRNA was prepared by enzymatic synthesis (Ambion MEGAscript® T7 Kit) from DNA templates obtained by PCR. PCR templates were either plasmid clones (Pan2 and Xrn1, the latter a gift of Sarah Newbury) or oligo(dT)-primed cDNA derived from S2 cell RNA (all others). Primer pairs are listed in supplemental Table S1. 45 μg of dsRNA was placed into a 60-mm cell culture dish. Logarithmically growing cells were diluted with serum-free medium to 1 × 106/ml (final serum concentration 1.5% or less), 3 ml were added per dish, incubated for 30 min at 25 °C and then mixed with 6 ml of medium containing 10% serum. After 4 days, cells were split into 1-ml aliquots. When the dsRNA treatment reduced the growth rate, two batches of knock-down cells were combined and split into 2-ml aliquots. If knock-down efficiency was to be confirmed by Western blotting, protein was isolated from one aliquot: Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 75 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 8% glycerol) and frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on ice 3 times. RNA was isolated from all other aliquots according to the TRIzol® protocol (Invitrogen). Pelleted RNA was dried at room temperature and dissolved in water by incubation at 65 °C for 20–30 min. Concentrations were determined by spectrophotometry. If no antibody was available to confirm the knock-down, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was done as follows: 1.5 μg of total RNA from knock-down and control cells was reverse-transcribed with 20 pmol dT12 primer and 150 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a 25-μl reaction as recommended by the supplier. For the subsequent PCR, 1 μl of this reaction was used as template in a total volume of 80 μl of 1× green GoTaq® Flexi buffer (Promega) containing 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1 μm primer (each), and 0.5 units of GoTaq® DNA polymerase (Promega). Primers are listed in supplemental Table S2. After 2 min at 94 °C, cycles consisted of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 60 s at 72 °C. After 29, 31 and 33 cycles, aliquots were taken and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Cytochrome c cDNA was amplified as a control.Northern Blots—Probes directed against the PABPN1 RNP domain and the hsp70 3′-UTR were synthesized by transcription of linearized plasmids similar to those described above. All other probes were generated by transcription of templates obtained by RT-PCR (supplemental Table S3). T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) was used in the presence of 10–40 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the supplier. Total RNA (between 1 and 2.5 μg depending on the experiment) was electrophoretically separated on a 5% polyacrylamide-8.3 m urea gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences) by semidry electro-blotting in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA. After UV irradiation, hybridization and washing were carried out as described (59Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning.Vol. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2001: 7.42-7.44Google Scholar), and the blots were exposed to a phosphorimager screen.Cap Analysis—Total RNA (10 or 15 μg depending on the experiment) was denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and placed on ice. Depending on the amount of RNA used, 1 or 1.5 units of Terminator™ 5′-phosphate-dependent exonuclease (Epicentre) was added, the volume was adjusted to 20 or 30 μl, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h under conditions specified by the supplier. The volume was adjusted to 200 μl with water, 10 μg of glycogen was added, the RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and dissolved either in 10 μl of 1 mm EDTA (for subsequent RNase H digestion) or in formamide-loading buffer.RNase H Digestion—RNase H digestion was performed as described (57Dellavalle R.P. Petersen R. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3646-3659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 10 μg of RNA was used for each digestion. Oligonucleotide 1 (5′-GTCCAGAGTAGCCGCCAAATCCTCCGGCC-3′) was used for the hsp70 mRNA, oligonucleotide 2 (5′-TTAATCGACCTCCTCCATGTGGGAAGC-3′) for the hsp83 mRNA, and dT12 instead of dT15 for removal of the poly(A) tail. RNase H was from Promega, and digestion was for 45 min at 37 °C. 10 μg of glycogen was added, RNA was pelleted by ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in formamide-loading buffer.Mapping of the hsp70 Ab Polyadenylation Site—3 μg of total RNA from stable cell lines in which the transcription of the RNP-HSP70 3′-UTR or the RNP-HSP70 3′-UTR ARE- constructs had been induced was used for RT-PCR amplification of the 3′-UTR and poly(A) tail as described earlier (38Temme C. Zaessinger S. Simonelig M. Wahle E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2862-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out with the HSP70 Sal primer (see above) and the oligo(dT) anchor primer. The PCR products were purified and sequenced with the Hsp70 Sal primer.Bulk Poly(A) Analysis—The length of bulk poly(A) was analyzed essentially as described previously (38Temme C. Zaessinger S.

Because the tissue content and distribution of these sulfated glycosphingolipids on the epithelium of the alimentary tract are rather limited, galectin-4 binding to lipids was re-examined. It was found that galectin-4 binds to cholesterol 3-sulfate, which could not be separated from SM4 and SM3 by the TLC solvent system in our previous paper (2Ideo H. Seko A. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4730-4737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although cholesterol 3-sulfate does not have a sugar (galactose) moiety. Galectins are a family of animal lectins defined by their affinity for β-galactoside and by common amino acid sequence elements (3Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was of interest to determine whether other galectins, in addition to galectin-4, also bind to cholesterol 3-sulfate. As reported previously, galectin-8 binds to glycosphingolipids, including sulfatide (SM4s), SM3, sialyl Lc4Cer, SB1a, GD1a, GM3, and sialyl nLc4Cer (4Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because SO–3→3core 1 also binds to a galectin-3-Sepharose column (1Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and synthetic sulfated oligosaccharides bind to human splenic galectin-1 (5Allen H.J. Ahmed H. Matta K.L. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we examined whether galectins-1, -3, and -8 have affinity for cholesterol 3-sulfate, similar to that of galectin-4. We found in this study that this cholesterol 3-sulfate-binding character is unique to galectin-4. Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have been targeted at carbohydrates containing β-galactoside (6Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Henrick K. Bawumia S.

Here, to determine the binding mechanism of cholesterol 3-sulfate, we prepared full-length galectin-4 and site-directed mutants of the N- and C-domains, based on comparisons of the amino acids in the S3 β-sheets of various galectins, and we examined their binding to various ligands. Although galectins do not have secretion signal peptides, they are often found outside of cells (3Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar).

Because the involvement of galectin-4 in apical protein delivery has also been reported in HT-29 cells (13Delacour D. Gouyer V. Zanetta J.P. Drobecq H. Leteurtre E. Grard G. Moreau-Hannedouche O. Maes E. Pons A. Andre S. Le Bivic A. Gabius H.J. Manninen A. Simons K. Huet G. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine which molecules interact with galectin-4 in the cytosol and the regulatory mechanism that is important for protein trafficking in epithelial cells. Materials—Cholesterol 3-sulfate, asialofetuin, β-lactoglobulin, and fucoidan from Fucus vesiculosus were purchased from Sigma. Sodium dextran sulfate, GM1, GM3, SM4s, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Keratan sulfate sodium salt and heparan sulfate sodium salt were obtained from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan), and heparin sodium salt, chondroitin sulfate A sodium salt, and chondroitin sulfate C sodium salt were from Nacalai Tesque Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) was obtained from Pierce. The pGEX-6P-1 plasmid, Escherichia coli BL21 strain, glutathione-Sepharose, and PreScission protease were from Amersham Biosciences. Synthesis of 3′-Sulfo-Core 1 by Gal 3-O-Sulfotransferase-2 (Gal3ST-2)—Sulfation of core 1 was performed using recombinant Gal3ST-2. The cDNA encoding the catalytic region of human Gal3ST-2 was amplified by PCR using an expression vector as the template, as reported previously (14Honke K. Tsuda M. Koyota S. Wada Y. Iida-Tanaka N.

Cancer Res. 2002; 93: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers were 5′-tttgaattcGGGGGCCAGGCTGAGGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-tttgcggccgcAGGAGGCCTCGTC-3′ (reverse primer). The sequences in lowercase letters indicate the restriction sites. The amplified cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and NotI and cloned into pPIC9 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). The pPIC9 plasmids were introduced into Pichia pastoris KM71 cells. The recombinant proteins were secreted into the culture medium and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography, as described previously (16Seko A. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The total activity of Gal3ST-2 from a 400-ml culture was 2.4 nmol/min. The reaction mixture (5 ml), containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.7, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm spermine, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (Calbiochem), 1 mm core 1, and the enzyme fractions was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. After heating at 100 °C to stop the reaction, the mixture was applied to a Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography column (1.4 × 68 cm; eluted with EtOH/water, 5:95 v/v). The desalted oligosaccharides were applied to a Sephadex A-25 chromatography column (0.9 × 6.3 cm; equilibrated with 3 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.1 m). The oligosaccharide-containing fractions (0.05–0.07 m NaCl) were collected and desalted again by Sephadex G-25. Finally, 0.6 μmol of 3′-O-sulfated core 1 was obtained. Preparation of Galectins—The expression of various galectins was carried out as follows: full-length His-tagged galectin-4 was prepared as described previously (1Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The His-tagged galectin-4-N-domain was prepared as full-length galectin-4, using 5′-gctgtcgacATGGCCTATGTCCCCGCA-3′ as the sense primer and 5′-accaagcttGTAAGGTGGCATCATCGG-3′ as the antisense primer. The GST-tagged galectin-4-C-domain was prepared as described previously (2Ideo H. Seko A. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4730-4737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For His-tagged galectin-1, the primers were 5′-tttggatccATGGCTTGTGGTCTG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-tttaagcttTCAGTCAAAGGCCAC-3′ (reverse primer). The Super-Script™ human testis cDNA library (Invitrogen) was the template. The PCR products were inserted into the pQE9 plasmid (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) between the BamHI and the HindIII sites, and the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain M15[pREP4]. Previously prepared galectin-3 cDNA (1Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was inserted into the pCold I plasmid (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) between the NdeI and BamHI sites and transformed into the E. coli BL21 strain. GST-galectin-8 was prepared as described previously (4Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were confirmed using an ABI PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer. His-tagged and GST-tagged proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Their lectin activities were checked by measuring their binding abilities to asialofetuin. Removal of GST from GST-galectin domains was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GE Healthcare). Antiserum against human galectin-4 was prepared as described previously (2Ideo H. Seko A. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4730-4737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ELISA for Binding of Galectins to Various Lipids—ELISAs for the binding of galectin-4 to various lipids were performed as described previously with some modifications (4Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids (1 μg/well) in MeOH were added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate (Dynatech Laboratories Inc. or Nunc-Immuno Plate Maxisorp Surface, Nalge Nunc International K.K.). After evaporation of the solvent, 100 μl of 1% BSA in PBS were added as a blocking solution, and the plate was left overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, 50 μl of various concentrations of galectins in the blocking solution were added to each well, and the plate was left for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed several times with washing buffer (0.01% Tween 20 in PBS), and anti-galectin-4 or anti-His6 antibody (clone BMG-His-1; Roche Applied Science) diluted in the washing buffer was added. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the plate was washed, and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (GE Healthcare) or alkaline phosphatase (The Binding Site Ltd., Birmingham, UK) was added. p-Nitrophenylphosphoric acid disodium salt (pNPP) in 0.1 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and o-phenylenediamine (Nacalai Tesque Inc., Kyoto, Japan) in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, were used as the substrates for alkaline phosphatase and HRP, respectively. For the galectin-4 binding assay, the results using anti-His6 antibody were almost the same as the results using anti-galectin-4 antibody. However, the anti-His6 antibody resulted in a lower background than the anti-galectin-4. Because the detection limit of anti-galectin-4 toward galectin-4 was lower than that of the anti-His6 antibody, anti-galectin-4 detected a small amount of nonspecific binding of galectin-4 to the plate, which occurred even after BSA blocking. Furthermore, the anti-His6 antibody did not recognize the carbohydrate recognition sites of the galectins. Therefore, the binding could be directly compared without considering the recognition specificity and binding activity of the antibody. Thus, we used the anti-His6 antibody for the binding assays. Co-sedimentation Assays—Co-precipitation of galectin-4 with lipid vesicles was performed according to Kojima et al. (17Kojima K. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Osawa T. Ogawa H. Matsumoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7679-7685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Five μg of lipids were dissolved in TBS and sonicated at 0 °C for 15 min to prepare lipid vesicles. Lipid solutions (20 μl) containing 5 μg of lipids and 1.5 μg of galectin-4 were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were stained with Sypro Orange™ (Bio-Rad) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Inhibition Assay Based on ELISA—The inhibition assay between galectin-4 and cholesterol 3-sulfate was performed using ELISA as described above. Fifty μl of galectin-4 (1 μg/ml) with various concentrations of inhibitors in 1% BSA in PBS were applied to cholesterol 3-sulfate-coated plates (1 μg/well), and the relative binding abilities of galectin-4 were measured using anti-His6 antibody. Binding of Galectins to Immobilized Asialofetuin on the Surface of a BIAcore Sensor Chip—The binding of galectins to asialofetuin was measured by a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay using a BIAcore 2000 instrument. Asialofetuin was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip by the amine-coupling method. Various concentrations of galectins were diluted in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.4 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20) and injected onto the sensor chip at 20 μl/min. The sensor surface was regenerated with 0.1 m lactose. Estimation of Kinetic Constants Based on SPR—The dissociation constants between the galectin-4-N- or -C-domains and carbohydrates were measured using a galectin-4-domain-immobilized sensor in a BIAcore 2000 instrument, as described previously (1Ideo H. Seko A. Ohkura T. Matta K.L. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of Full-length Galectin-4 and Galectin-4-N- and C-domains—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using an Applied Biosystems PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Gel-filtration chromatography was performed using Superose 12 (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA. Galectin-4 (200 μl, 100 μg/ml) was applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min at room temperature, and 0.15-ml fractions were collected. The absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm was monitored with an ATTO Bio-mini UV monitor AC-5200 (Atto Co., Tokyo, Japan). Fractions containing proteins were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-galectin-4 antibody followed by HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (GE Healthcare), and visualized with the ECL system (GE Healthcare). The column was calibrated using blue dextran, BSA (67 kDa; GE Healthcare), β-lactoglobulin (35 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa; GE Healthcare). The binding assay to cholesterol 3-sulfate was performed using galectin-4 antibody and anti-His6 antibody. Chemical Cross-linking—For each reaction, 1 μl of fresh 20 mm DSS solution prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was added to a 40-μl aliquot of galectin solution (100 μg/ml) for a final concentration of 0.5 mm, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 μlof1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for a final concentration of 50 mm, followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, subjected to electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Extraction of Protein and Lipids from Porcine Esophagus and Intestine—Porcine esophagus and intestine were obtained from a slaughterhouse. Several grams of porcine esophagus and intestine were cut into small pieces and homogenized in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1:100 (v/v) Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce)). The homogenates were cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min to remove tissue debris and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in the same buffer, re-extracted at 37 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged with at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Crude lipids from the resulting pellets were extracted and analyzed as follows. Crude lipids of homogenized porcine esophagus and intestine were extracted once with 5 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The pooled extracts (total lipid extracts) were dried and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The solution was spotted for TLC (10 × 10 cm, silica gel 60; Merck) and developed using chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/water (8:2:4:2:1, by volume) as the solvent to separate cholesterol 3-sulfate and SM4. Sulfated lipids were detected by azure A (18Iida N. Toida T. Kushi Y. Handa S. Fredman P. Svennerholm L. Ishizuka I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5974-5980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-galectin-4 antibody as described above. Galectin-4 Binding to Cholesterol 3-Sulfate—Galectin-4 binds to glycosphingolipids carrying 3-O-sulfated Gal residues derived from colon epithelial cells (2Ideo H. Seko A. Yamashita K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4730-4737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the mobility of cholesterol 3-sulfate corresponded to that of authentic SM4, which was stained by the azure A method on TLC using chloroform, methanol, 0.2% CaCl2 (60:35:7) as the solvent, we reexamined whether cholesterol 3-sulfate and various lipids bound to galectin-4. First, we measured the binding abilities of galectin-4 to various lipid-coated plates using an antibody against galectin-4 (Fig. 1A). Galectin-4 bound, not only to SM4 and GM1, but also to cholesterol 3-sulfate, although this molecule has no carbohydrate moieties. In contrast, galectin-4 did not bind to cholesterol. The binding abilities of galectin-4 to these lipids were also examined by co-sedimentation assays. After incubation of galectin-4 with the respective lipid vesicles, the lipid-associated galectin-4 was precipitated by centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, galectin-4 bound to cholesterol 3-sulfate, SM4, GM1, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine, but not to phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or cholesterol, consistent with the ELISA results described above. Comparison of Galectins-1, -3, -4, and -8 Binding to Cholesterol 3-Sulfate—Because the strong binding of galectin-4 to cholesterol 3-sulfate was observed, we next studied whether other members of the galectin family could also bind to cholesterol 3-sulfate. The binding abilities of His-tagged galectins-1, -3, and -4 were compared using an anti-His tag antibody and an HRP-conjugated second antibody. The binding ability of galectin-8 was measured using anti-galectin-8 antibody and an HRP-conjugated second antibody. When each galectin (1 μg/ml) in 50 μl of 1% BSA in PBS was applied to various amounts of cholesterol 3-sulfate-coated plates, only galectin-4 bound to cholesterol 3-sulfate (Fig. 1D, •). Galectins-1, -3, and -8 did not bind to cholesterol 3-sulfate (Fig. 1D, ▪, ▴, Δ, respectively), even at 10 μg/well of cholesterol 3-sulfate. When various concentrations of each galectin were applied to the cholesterol 3-sulfate-coated plates, galectin-4 bound to cholesterol 3-sulfate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1E, •). However, galectins-1, -3, and -8 did not bind (Fig. 1E, ▪, ▴, Δ, respectively). Although the GST-galectin-8-N-domain bound to SM3, GM3, and SM4 (4Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it did not bind to cholesterol 3-sulfate. These results indicate that galectin-4 has a unique ability to bind cholesterol 3-sulfate, unlike galectins-1, -3, and -8. Inhibition of Galectin-4 Binding to Cholesterol 3-Sulfate by Anionic Polysaccharides—The binding ability of galectin-4 to cholesterol 3-sulfate was divalent cation-independent, because the binding was not influenced by the addition of 10 mm EDTA (data not shown). To clarify the basis for the specificity of galectin-4 binding to cholesterol 3-sulfate, carbohydrates and anionic polysaccharides were tested as inhibitors using ELISA. When 1.4 pmol (50 ng/50 μl) of galectin-4 and various concentrations of inhibitors were applied to the cholesterol 3-sulfate-coated plates, the IC50 values for dextran sulfate, fucoidan, heparin, keratan sulfate, A-tetra, lactose, and chondroitin sulfate were calculated to be 0.04, 0.07, 15, 500, 500, 1 × 104, and >1 × 104 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 2). The IC50 value of dextran sulfate is 0.04 μg/ml, which means ∼2ngin50 μl contain at least 3.4 pmol of 3-O-sulfated glucose (calculated as one 3-O-sulfated glucose per 2 glucose units). On the basis of such a stoichiometry, the best inhibitors of galectin-4 binding to cholesterol 3-sulfate were dextran sulfate and fucoidan, which have sulfate residues at the C-3 and/or C-2 positions of glucose and fucose, respectively. Chondroitin sulfate has sulfate residues at the C-4 or C-6 positions of N-acetylgalactosamine, and keratan sulfate has sulfate residues at the C-6 position of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine. Heparin has a sulfate residue at C-2, -3, or -6 of glucosamine. These results suggest that galectin-4 strongly recognizes 3-O-or2-O-sulfated glycans, but not 4-O-or6-O-sulfated glycans, irrespective of their monosaccharide compositions. These structural differences may reflect their inhibitory strengths toward the galectin-4/cholesterol 3-sulfate interaction. Similarly, it has been reported that the binding of 200 ng/ml of thrombospondin to sulfatide was inhibited by 2.3 ng/ml of dextran sulfate (19Holt G.D. Pangburn M.K. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2852-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Roles of the Lys44 and Arg45 Residues in Galectin-4-N-domain Binding—We next investigated which amino acids of galectin-4 were responsible for its binding to cholesterol 3-sulfate. X-ray crystal structures of human galectins-2, -3, -7, and -10 showed that these galectins have very similar tertiary structures (20Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13930-13940Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants of galectins have been studied only with β-galactoside. The amino acids that are critical for lactose binding in the S4, S5, and S6 β-sheets (6Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23648-23653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) are well conserved in galectins-1–9 (asterisks in Fig. 3). Our previous study of galectin-8 revealed that only its N-domain has affinity for sialic acid/sulfate and that a specific amino acid in the S3 β-sheet interacts with sialic acid/sulfate (4Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Galectin-4, like galectin-8, consists of two tandemly repeated carbohydrate recognition domains. Amino acids in the S3 β-sheet are likely to be involved in the binding of sialic acid/sulfate residues, because galactose-3-O-linked nonreducing terminal moieties were deduced to interact with amino acids in the extended clefts formed by the S3 β-sheet of galectins. We investigated which amino acids in the galectin-4-N-domain interact with sulfate residues. Comparison of the amino acids in the S3 sheets of galectins showed that only the galectin-4-N-domain had the successive basic amino acids Lys44 and Arg45 (Fig. 3). Therefore, we constructed two mutated galectin-4s, K44A and R45A, and we analyzed their carbohydrate-binding abilities. The binding of oligosaccharides to the wild type and mutant (K44A and R45A) galectin-4-N-domains, which were individually immobilized on CM5 sensor chips, was measured using the SPR assay (Fig. 4). The wild type and mutant N-domains showed similar affinities toward A-tetra (Fig. 4, A–C) and other neutral oligosaccharides (data not shown), indicating that the binding ability toward these oligosaccharides did not differ much between the wild type and the mutants. Interestingly, SO–3→3core 1 did not bind to the R45A mutant (Fig. 4F), suggesting that Arg45 is important for sulfate residue recognition. The Binding Ability of the K226V Mutant of the Galectin-4-C-domain to Sulfated Oligosaccharides—The galectin-4-C-domain has two basic amino acids, Lys219 and Lys226, in the S3 β-sheet (Fig. 3). A comparison of the amino acids in the S3 β-sheets of galectins showed that Lys219 is conserved in galectin-1, the galectin-4-N-domain, and the galectin-8-C-domain, whereas Lys226 is not conserved among galectins. Because our earlier study revealed that galectin-1 and the galectin-8-C-domain did not bind to SM4 (4Ideo H. Seko A. Ishizuka I. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Lys219 seems not to be responsible for the binding to sulfated glycosphingolipids. Therefore, we constructed a mutated galectin-4-C-domain with Val226 replacing Lys226 (K226V). We constructed and purified t"
https://openalex.org/W2143926403,"The fusion peptide EBO16 (GAAIGLAWIPYFGPAA) comprises the fusion domain of an internal sequence located in the envelope fusion glycoprotein (GP2) of the Ebola virus. This region interacts with the cellular membrane of the host and leads to membrane fusion. To gain insight into the mechanism of the peptide-membrane interaction and fusion, insertion of the peptide was modeled by experiments in which the tryptophan fluorescence and 1H NMR were monitored in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles or in the presence of detergent-resistant membrane fractions. In the presence of SDS micelles, EBO16 undergoes a random coil-helix transition, showing a tendency to self-associate. The three-dimensional structure displays a 310-helix in the central part of molecule, similar to the fusion peptides of many known membrane fusion proteins. Our results also reveal that EBO16 can interact with detergent-resistant membrane fractions and strongly suggest that Trp-8 and Phe-12 are important for structure maintenance within the membrane bilayer. Replacement of tryptophan 8 with alanine (W8A) resulted in dramatic loss of helical structure, proving the importance of the aromatic ring in stabilizing the helix. Molecular dynamics studies of the interaction between the peptide and the target membrane also corroborated the crucial participation of these aromatic residues. The aromatic-aromatic interaction may provide a mechanism for the free energy coupling between random coil-helical transition and membrane anchoring. Our data shed light on the structural “domains” of fusion peptides and provide a clue for the development of a drug that might block the early steps of viral infection. The fusion peptide EBO16 (GAAIGLAWIPYFGPAA) comprises the fusion domain of an internal sequence located in the envelope fusion glycoprotein (GP2) of the Ebola virus.

The Ebola virus belongs to the Filoviridae family and causes hemorrhagic fever in primates, resulting in high mortality rates (1Peters C.J. Sanchez A. Rollin P.E. Ksiazek T.G. Murphy F.A. Fields B.N.

It is comprised of two polypeptides, GP1 and GP2, linked by a disulfide bond. The structure of a fragment of Ebola fusion protein (GP2) was solved at 1.9 Å of resolution (6Malashkevich V.N.

However, the fusion peptide (524GAAIGLAWIPYFGPAA539) was not included (6Malashkevich V.N. Schneider B.J. McNally M.L. Milhollen M.A. Pang J.X. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 6032-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This peptide shares general features with many other viral membrane fusion proteins. As previously predicted, the fusion peptide consists of 16 uncharged residues that are conserved within the virus family (9Ito H. Watanabe S. Sanchez A. Whitt M.A. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fusion peptide region, which is believed to insert into the cellular membrane, is located at the extreme N terminus of GP2, and the GP2 C-terminal region is adjacent to the transmembrane helix anchored in the viral membrane (10Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Goñi F.M. Pereira F.B. Nieva J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most enveloped viruses, when the virus is inactive to fusion, the fusion peptide is buried and protected in a hydrophobic core of the soluble glycoprotein ectodomain, whereas when the virus is in the fusion active state, the fusion peptide is exposed and available for fusion into the target host membrane (10Ruiz-Arguello M.B.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). glycoprotein nuclear Overhauser (NOE) spectroscopy large unilamellar vesicle root mean square deviation detergent-resistant membrane fraction phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol cholesterol wild type To better understand the fusion mechanism, we have determined the structure of the fusion peptide of the GP2 from Ebola virus, utilizing a combination of spectroscopic techniques such as circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, molecular dynamics, and nuclear magnetic resonance. We show the atomic structure and the conformational exchange of the Ebola fusion peptide in the presence of micelles at pH 7 as well as its interaction with detergent-resistant membrane fractions (DRMs), usually considered to correspond to the lipid rafts originated from plasma membrane. The three-dimensional structure reveals how the aromatic residues (Trp-8 and Phe-12) play a crucial role for structure maintenance within the membrane environment. Substitution of Trp-8 causes destabilization of the helical structure. Knowledge of the EBO16 structure in solution allowed us to characterize the structural changes upon interaction with lipid microdomains. These structural studies are important to determine structural identities among the enveloped viruses, which should help in the rational design of antiviral drugs. Peptide—The Ebola fusion domain was purchased from Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA. Its purity and molecular mass were assessed by electrospray mass spectrometry, high performance liquid chromatography, and amino acid analysis. The purity was greater than 95%. Stock solutions were prepared by suspending the peptide at 1 or 2 mm in double-distilled water, where it is fully insoluble. The solubility was acquired after the addition of membrane models or dimethyl sulfoxide. The peptide concentration was calculated from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient ϵ280 of 6970 cm-1 m-1. Circular Dichroism—CD data were collected using a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter. In general, a 2-mm path length cuvette with 100 μm fusion peptide in 15 mm phosphate, pH 7, was used for CD experiments. Each of the CD spectra was obtained from an average of four scans with a 2-nm bandwidth. The temperature was maintained at 298 K, the scan rate was 50 nm/min, the step resolution was 1.0; the response time was 8 s. After background subtraction and smoothing, all of the CD data were converted from CD signal (millidegrees) into mean residue molar ellipticity (deg cm2 dmol-1) by using the equation [θ] = θ.10-1l-1c-1N-1, where l is the cell length in cm, c is the molar concentration, and N is the number of amino acid residues in the peptide. Peptide Binding to SDS Micelles—Peptide binding to SDS micelles was estimated by variation of the fluorescence emitted by Trp, based on the spectral shift that accompanies the change in its environment. Trp was excited at 280 nm, and its fluorescence emission was acquired from 315 to 420 nm. In addition, fluorescence quenching experiments were performed with 10-50 mm acrylamide as an extrinsic quencher. The fluorescence quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer relationship (11Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar), F0/F = 1 + K[Q], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and in the presence of the quencher, [Q] is the quencher concentration, and K is the quenching constant. Trp fluorescence was recorded at 340 nm (λexc = 280 nm). The peptide concentration was 10 μm. Fluorescence polarization was measured with excitation at 295 nm, and emission recorded through a WG320S filter (50% cut-off at 320 nm). The experiment was carried out at 25 °C in 15 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7. The peptide concentration was 100 μm. Three-dimensional Structure—NMR measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Bruker AMX 600-MHz NMR spectrometer in the phase-sensitive mode using States time-proportional phase incrementation. The sample contained 2 mm peptide, 400 mm d25-SDS in phosphate buffer, pH 7 (90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v)). Total correlation spectroscopy experiments were performed with WATERGATE water suppression and MLEV-17 spin-locking pulse with a mixing time of 100 ms. Nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments were recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms, also using WATERGATE. The three-dimensional structure was calculated with the program CNS_SOLVE 1.1 (12Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The resulting 20 energy-minimized conformers were used to represent the structure of the fusion domain in SDS micelles. Molecular Dynamic Simulations—Simulations were carried out at 25 °C using the GROMACS package version (13Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D.J. Mol. Mod. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). The initial configuration of micelle with 63 SDS and the simulation parameters were described by Tieleman et al. (14Tieleman D.P. van der Spoel D. Berendsen H.J. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 6380-6388Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The water SPC model was utilized in both simulations with SDS and n-hexane molecules modeled by GROMOS45A3 force field, being that the atomic charges of the polar head of SDS are the same utilized by Schweighofer et al. (15Schweighofer K.J. Essmann U. Berkowitz M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 3793-3799Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The n-hexane/water interface in the simulation box is 6.17 × 6.17 × 7.92 nm3 and to micelle/water interface is 7.59 × 7.81 × 7.79 nm3. Counter ions Na+ and Cl- were utilized to maintain the electroneutrality of the systems. The Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions were considered until 1.2 nm, and the Particle-Mesh Ewald technique (16Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21400) Google Scholar) was used for the treatment of the electrostatic interactions since the residues are ionized at pH 7. Purification of DRMs—All procedures were carried out on ice. Four T-150 and two T-75 glasses of Vero cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer and treated for 10 s with a dissociation buffer (enzyme free). Cells were harvested and washed by centrifugation at 730 × g for 2 min at 4 °C in phosphate buffer and then once in phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 20 mm sodium orthovanadate (17Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), 2 mm aminoethyl benzene sulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100. The cells were then lysed by passage through a 28 × 7 needle 10 times. An equal volume of 80% sucrose was added to mixer with lysed cells and placed in the bottom of sucrose gradient of 40 to 5% and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C using a SW40 Ti rotor. The gradient was fractionated, and the raft fraction was confirmed by dot blotting using cholera toxin B subunit peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). DRMs and Peptide Interaction—NMR measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Bruker AMX 600-MHz NMR spectrometer in the phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation. The sample contained 1 mm peptide, DRMs in phosphate buffer pH 7 (90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v)). NOESY experiments were recorded with a mixing time of 80 ms using WATERGATE. The spectra were collected in the presence of DRMs with 512 data points in F1, 4096 points in F2, and 32 scans. In the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) (PC:PE:PI:Cho) the spectra were collected with 128 data points in F1, 4096 points in F2, and 256 scans. The signal/noise was approximately twice larger in the presence of DRMs than in the presence of LUVs. Conformational Changes Induced by Membrane-Mimetic Environments—Recent studies have shown the high hydrophobicity of the fusion peptide of Ebola virus (9Ito H. Watanabe S. Sanchez A. Whitt M.A. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and one or two charged amino acids have been added to the peptide sequence to minimize peptide aggregation in solution (18Suárez T. Gómara M.J. Goñi F.M. Mingarro I. Muga A. Pérez-Payá E. Nieva J.L. FEBS Lett. 2003; 535: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because we were interested in the structure of the fusion peptide in a membrane-mimetic environment, we did not add any charged amino acids. To investigate the secondary structure of EBO16, we examined the far-UV CD spectra. As shown in Fig. 1A, the peptide assumes a random-coil conformation in aqueous buffer and a more defined structure in the presence of SDS micelles, where it displays a typical helical structure. In the presence of 60 mm dodecylphosphocholine, a phospholipid-derived detergent, the fusion peptide displays two conformational states, random coil and α-helix (data not shown). This condition was not suitable for determining the structure by NMR because of the conformational exchange between folded and unfolded states. The CD studies reveal that SDS micelles provide a good model for characterizing and determining the EBO16 structure. Interactions between the Ebola Fusion Peptide and SDS Micelles—To follow the binding of EBO16 with SDS micelles, we measured tryptophan fluorescence emission. In EBO16 there is only one tryptophan, located in the middle of the sequence. Fluorescence emission in the absence of SDS shows a maximum emission wavelength of ∼337 nm (Fig. 1B). This maximum reflects the tryptophan accessibility and the peptide aggregation because of its high hydrophobicity and random structure. In fact, when EBO16 was incubated with SDS micelles, the spectral peak was blue-shifted from 337 to 324 nm (Fig. 1B). The shift of about 13 nm suggests that tryptophan enters a hydrophobic environment in the SDS micelles. In addition, the quantum yield was much higher in the presence of SDS micelles (not shown). To further characterize the peptide insertion into SDS micelles, we carried out acrylamide fluorescence quenching experiments. Stern-Volmer plots provide an indication of solvent accessibility; a steep slope indicates that the tryptophan residue is exposed to the acrylamide, whereas a lower slope indicates that the tryptophan is protected from the acrylamide (19Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows the Stern-Volmer plots for EBO16 in the absence and in the presence of SDS micelles. In the absence of SDS micelles, a steep slope is observed (Ksv = 15.8 m-1), whereas in the presence of SDS micelles a reduced slope is obtained (Ksv = 10.2 m-1). The fluorescence data clearly indicate that the single Trp of EBO16 is protected by the micelle from quenching. EBO16 in the micellar environment undergoes structural modifications including intramolecular rearrangements and acquisition of helical structure, showing a tendency to self-associate. NMR Analysis of Secondary Structure—The 1H NMR data were obtained using perdeuterated SDS micelles at 298 K and pH 7. The NOESY spectrum of EBO16 displayed numerous well resolved cross-peaks (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the peptide is folded and that assignment should be possible. The NOEs were assigned, and differences in the Hα chemical shifts (Δδ in ppm) between observed and random-coil values are shown in Fig. 2B. Negative Δδ values >0.1 ppm were observed in the middle of the molecule, which is, therefore, considered to assume a helical conformation (20Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). In fact, analysis of the NOESY spectra provided similar results when intraresidual, sequential, and medium range connectivities were evaluated, as summarized in Fig. 2A. The observation of medium dαN (i, i+3) and stronger dNN, suggested a stabilized α-helix structure. However, the presence of dαN (i, i+2) in the same region indicates a 310 helix conformation (21Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The data show a continuous pattern of dαN (i, i+3) NOEs between Leu-6 and Phe-12. Furthermore, dNN and dαN NOEs indicate the presence of helical structure in this region. However, the absence of dαN (i, i+4) and the presence of the continuous pattern dNN (i, i+2) and dαN (i, i+2) NOE connectivities suggest the 310 helix structure (Fig. 2A). Taken together, the NOE connectivities and chemical shift deviation data support the presence of a helix from Leu-6 to Phe-12 (Fig. 2, A and B). This was also observed in 40, 100, and 200 mm SDS, which confirms a stable interaction between the peptide and SDS at concentrations above the critical micellar concentration (data not shown). NMR Structure Calculation—From a total of 416 assigned NOE cross-peaks, 198 non-redundant upper-limit constraints were obtained for EBO16 (Table 1). The backbone structures of the lowest energy conformers of EBO16 in SDS micelles at pH 7.0 are shown (Fig. 3B). From the initial 100 structures calculated, 20 structures were selected corresponding to those structures exhibiting the lowest energy (Figs. 3, A and B). They did not violate NOEs and dihedral angle constraints. The overall energy of the selected structures was 23.97 ± 3.03 kcal/mol. The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) among all peptide residues was 2.4 Å; however, the best fit was found between Leu-6 and Phe-12 residues, probably because of the proximity of Trp-8 and Phe-12, which stacks the rings edge-to-face (Fig. 3D). The aromatic-aromatic interaction can induce structure stability because of the interaction of partial charges located in the face and in the hydrogen atoms of aromatic rings (22Serrano L. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This region is located on a more hydrophobic face of the EBO16 peptide, as shown in Figs. 3, E and F. Because hydrophobic regions have been related to membrane interaction, this region could play an important role in the lipid bilayer destabilization (9Ito H. Watanabe S. Sanchez A. Whitt M.A. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chernomordik L.V. Koslov M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The Trp-8 could be critical for fusion activity, as observed for dengue virus (24Modis Y. Ogata S. Clements D. Harrison S.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of structural statistics of the EBO16 peptide at pH 7.0 in SDS micellesNOE distance constraints198Energies (kcal/mol)Overall23.97 ± 3.03Bond1.04 ± 0.18Angle9.36 ± 0.54Improper1.33 ± 0.10VDW (LJ)3.24 ± 2.80NOE2.24 ± 0.96Backbone pairwise r.m.s.d.

Open table in a new tab To check for the presence of proline isomerization, the connectivities between Ile-9 and Pro-10 residues or Gly-13 and Pro-14 were available. The dαα (i, i+1) connectivity, typical for the cis conformer, and the dαδ (i, i+1) connectivity, typical for the trans conformer of proline, were evaluated. We found only one spin system for each proline residue, indicating a single conformation for each amino acid (data not shown). The dαδ (i, i+1) connectivities were observed, indicating that Pro-10 and Pro-14 are in trans conformation. Probably, the high structural convergence in this portion of the molecule justifies the absence of two conformers of Pro-10. In addition, there was a slight kink induced by proline. The proline kink would be expected because of the absence of the amide proton of the proline, which leads to a break in dαN (i, i+1), dαN (i, i+3), dαN (i, i+2), and other connectivities (Fig. 3A). However, the pattern of NOE connectivities of helical structure was maintained by α, γ, δ, and β proton connectivities (data not shown). Membrane Composition and Peptide Interaction—The lipid bilayer composition and its curvature should be the limiting step for peptide-membrane interaction (25Maia L.F. Soares M.R. Valente A.P. Almeida F.C. Oliveira A.C. Gomes A.M. Freitas M.S. Schneemann A. Johnson J.E. Silva J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29278-29286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). EBOEA and EBOEE, two fusion peptides of Ebola with charged residues added to decrease their hydrophobicity, were able to fuse with liposomes only in the presence of phosphatidylinositol (10Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Goñi F.M. Pereira F.B. Nieva J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol usually is present in cellular microdomains (lipid rafts) rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin (DRMs). These microdomains were shown to interact with Ebola GP protein (26Bavari S. Bosio C.M. Wiegand E. Ruthel G. Will A.B. Geisbert T.W. Hevey M. Schmaljohn C. Schmaljohn A. Aman M.J. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), but the correlation with the fusion mechanism was not investigated. We used nuclear magnetic resonance to map the interacting amino acid residues with the microdomains. Knowledge of the EBO16 structure in solution allowed us to follow the conformational changes in the presence of liposomes prepared with mixed lipid composition and from DRMs (Fig. 4). One-dimensional 1H spectra in the presence of LUVs containing PC:PE, PC/PE/PI/Cho, and DRMs show sharp lines typical of the peptide EBO16 in fast-intermediate to intermediate exchange between the membrane-bound and free form (Fig. 4B). Chemical shift changes could be observed especially when EBO16 was in the presence of DRMs (see the indolic hydrogen of Trp-8 at ∼10.1 ppm). This dynamic interaction enables the observation of the transfer NOEs (Fig. 4A). Because EBO16 is very flexible when free in solution, it did not show NOEs during the 80 ms of mixing time. We observed several NOEs during the same mixing time in the presence of DRMs or LUVs containing PC/PE/PI/Cho (Fig. 4A). These transferred NOEs can be used to map the interacting residues, since these hydrogens will become more rigid upon interaction. The increase in rigidity can be caused by a gain of structure or because of the interaction itself. The NOESY spectrum of EBO16 in the presence of DRMs showed transfer NOEs for all residues ranging from Leu-6 to Phe-12 (Fig. 4A). We also observed transferred NOEs for the residues ranging from Leu-6 to Ile-9 for EBO16 in the presence of LUVs containing PC/PE/PI/Cho. On the other hand, a lack of these peaks was observed in the absence of DRMs (supplemental Fig. 3). Our data show that the same region that is structured in the presence of SDS interacts with lipid rafts or the LUV containing PC/PE/PI/Cho (Fig. 4, A and C). These data are the first indication that EBO16 can interact with DRMs in an early stage of infection. Importance of Aromatic-Aromatic Interaction for Structural Stability—We hypothesized that the interaction between the aromatic ring of Trp-8 and the side chain of Phe-12 is important for maintenance of EBO16 stability under interaction with mimetic membranes. To show the influence of aromatic-aromatic interaction, we synthesized a mutant W8A. The structural behavior of the mutant peptide was followed by far-UV CD spectra in the presence of SDS micelles. As shown in Fig. 5A, the mutant W8A assumes a random coil conformation in the presence of SDS micelles. On the other hand, the EBO16 wt displays a typical helical structure under the same condition. To identify more specifically the secondary elements of peptide structure, we used α-carbon proton (Hα) chemical shifts deviation (20Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The data indicate a small tendency for the peptide to assume a helical conformation from Ile-4 to Ala-8, because of the smallest values of chemical shift deviation (<0.1 ppm) (Fig. 5B). Indeed, the differences between the chemical shifts of mutant W8A and wild type are more accentuated at Ile-9 (Fig. 5C). A loss of helical content at Ala-7 is also revealed (Fig. 5C). Negative chemical shift difference values show the tendency to increase the helical content, since positive values indicate a decrease. Taken together, CD, chemical shift deviation, and differences show a loss of peptide secondary structure caused by the lack of aromatic-aromatic interaction, which plays an important role to secondary structure maintenance. In addition, Bär and co-workers (27Bär S. Takada A. Kawaoka Y. Alizon M. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that Phe-12 plays an important role for the fusion process, as observed by cellular assays. The 1H NMR data were obtained using perdeuterated SDS micelles at 298 K and pH 7. The NOESY spectrum of EBO16 W8A displayed numerous well resolved cross-peaks (Fig. 5D), indicating that assignment should be possible. The chemical shift dispersion was more limited than observed with wt, reflecting the random nature and high degree of backbone mobility of SDS micelles binding structure (Fig. 5D). The interaction between mutant W8A with SDS micelles caused significant chemical shift changes of amide and side-chain hydrogen atoms in relation to the EBO16 wt (Fig. 5D). Ile-9 amide proton was strongly modified for ∼375 Hz, Ala-7 had a medium shift of 67.7 Hz, and some amino acids were not changed, such as Ile-4. Model for the Interaction between Ebola Fusion Peptide and Biological Membranes—The NMR structure and fluorescence data indicate that the peptide preferentially interacts with the hydrophobic sector of micelles and membranes through its central residues. Accordingly, we propose a model in which the middle of the peptide is inserted into the membrane, and both N-terminal and C-terminal residues extend away from the surface of the membrane. Within the membrane, the peptide is more structured because hydrogen bonds must form within and between peptides, whereas outside the membrane greater conformational disorder is allowed because of the formation of peptide-H2O hydrogen bonds. The central portion of EBO16 exhibits more connectivity than the non-structured region (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that the central region excludes water. Indeed, the Stern-Volmer constant obtained in the presence of SDS corroborates a shift of Trp-8 from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic environment, suggesting that the helix containing Trp may be embedded in the bilayer core (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, five N-terminal (GAAIG) and four C-terminal (GPAA) amino acids were not structured, indicating that the environment around these regions may be slightly different from that surrounding the helical portion of the molecule, with a tendency to destabilize the intramolecular connectivities. Glycine is an important residue in fusion peptides present in many enveloped viruses such as influenza, simian immunodeficiency virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 2 (28Tamm L.K. Han X. Li Y. Lai L.A. Biopolymers. 2002; 66: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although its exact role has not been determined. It has been correlated with the conformational flexibility of fusion peptides, which is necessary for fusion activity (29Wong T.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this work we suggest that glycines may be located on the same face before and after the helix, close to polar groups of the lipid bilayer, improving an interface between inner and outer host membrane. To understand the characteristics of peptide-micelle interactions, molecular dynamics simulations of EBO16 were carried out using coordinates from the lowest energy NMR structure reported here. We run two molecular dynamics simulations, 1) EBO16 in explicit SDS micelles and 2) EBO16 in explicit water-hexane interface. In the first, the peptide was initially placed 1 nm from the interfaces (SDS surface or water:hexane) with the helix oriented toward the interface (supplemental Fig. 4). The peptide structure data were maintained frozen until the peptide interaction with the surfaces reached equilibrium (Fig. 6, A and B). A simulation time of 4 ns was sufficient to reveal the interaction between EBO16 and the SDS micelle (Fig. 6A). The energy necessary for peptide-micelle interaction decreased more as the peptide advanced into the SDS micelle than in the case of the peptide-n-hexane interaction, suggesting that a simple hydrophobic model would favor the peptide interaction (Fig. 6, A and B). In SDS micelles the helical segment was maintained throughout the molecular dynamics simulation (Fig. 6E). This is the interacting segment of EBO16, as shown by transfer NOEs in the presence of the DRMs (Fig. 4A). In n-hexane, the molecular dynamics simulations did not support the structure obtained by NMR (Fig. 6F). The simpler model (water-n-hexane) takes into consideration only the interaction due to the hydrophobicity of the peptide, but it lacks the steric and charge effects. The steric effect of the SDS molecule, especially via the van der Walls contact with the hydrophobic chains, seems to contribute to the stabilization of the helical segment. The coulombic interaction with the SDS-charged group might have a role in the stabilization of the EBO16 helical structure. The high hydrophobicity of EBO16 probably favors its partitioning into the lipid bilayer. The fusion peptides of several enveloped viruses present an amphipathic helix, whereas the helix of EBO16 is hydrophobic (30Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar). For the fusion peptide of the influenza virus, the charged amino acids are distributed over the opposite surface from the hydrophobic side chains (30Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In contrast, EBO16 is formed with hydrophobic residues on the surfaces of the helix. Thus, the entry of the entire helix into the cellular membrane should be favored by the difference in dielectric constant between water and membrane. Thus, the interior of the membrane is a more energetically favorable environment than outside, contributing to drive the insertion of EBO16 into the lipid bilayer. For EBO16-SDS micelles, the peptide backbone r.m.s.d. from residues 6-12 stabilized at 2 Å, similar to EBO16-water-n-hexane interface (Figs. 6, C and D). However, the stabilization of residues 1-16 occurs at 4 Å in SDS micelles and at 6 Å in a water-n-hexane interface, suggesting the much higher structural stability of EBO16 in the presence of an amphipathic system (Figs. 6, C and D). The peptide-membrane interaction has been extensively characterized for influenza virus fusion peptide, which exhibits a small helical structure close to the N terminus at neutral pH (30Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref Scopus (406) Google Scholar). In the fusion state, the influenza virus fusion domain undergoes a conformational change that increases the peptide curvature and leads to a transition from an α-helix to a 310-helix localized at the C terminus of the molecule. EBO16 displays a central 310-helix structure at neutral pH in the presence of SDS micelles. The 310-helix is the fourth most common secondary motif in proteins and has recently attracted the attention of structural biologists, since it may act as a folding intermediate in the formation of an α-helix (31Milhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3873-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 32Sheinerman F.B. Brooks C.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10098-10103Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In fact, the presence of dαN (i,i+2) and the absence of dαN (i,i+4) connectivities illustrate the high flexibility and capacity for self-folding of EBO16 in the presence of a lipid bilayer (Fig. 2A). Although EBO16 self-folds when it interacts with lipid membranes, the fusion process probably requires the coiled-coil region (present in the GP2 protein), which would help the loop structure of the EBO16 peptide to capture the target membrane and bring it in close to the viral membrane so that lipid mixing takes place. This process was described for influenza virus, where the hypothesis of spring loading has been studied (33Carr C.M. Chaudhry C. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14306-14313Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Indeed, the similarity in the fusion process among different enveloped viruses points to this process as a potential target for the development of drugs that block virus entry and infection. Concluding Remarks—Here we describe the first structural characterization of the interaction of the fusion peptide of Ebola virus with lipid rafts (DRMs) and membrane-mimetic environments. The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever in primates, including humans, resulting in high mortality rates. Because of the difficulty in handling infectious particles, structural studies on the viral domain involved with the fusion with the host cell are crucial to understanding the mechanism of virus entry and developing compounds that might block the early step of viral infection. In this article we have determined the structure of the fusion domain (EBO16) located in the envelope fusion glycoprotein (GP2) of the Ebola virus. This region interacts with the cellular membrane of the host, leading to membrane destabilization and fusion. Fluorescence and NMR experiments as well molecular dynamics simulations allowed us to characterize the interaction with sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles and DRMs. The three-dimensional structure clearly revealed how the aromatic residues (Trp-8 and Phe-12) play a crucial role for structure maintenance within the membrane bilayer. The poor structure of the mutant peptide with a single-amino acid substitution (W8A) clearly demonstrates the key role of Trp-8 in establishing the interaction with the membrane. It is tempting to propose that the aromatic-aromatic interaction may elicit the random coil-helical transition coupled to membrane anchoring. Knowledge of the EBO16 structure in solution allowed us to characterize the structural changes upon interaction with DRMs, providing the first demonstration that Ebola fusion domain can interact with lipid microdomains in an early stage of infection.

To determine the molecular basis of human MC4R (hMC4R) responsible for α-melanocortin-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) binding, in this study, we utilized both receptor domain exchange and site-directed mutagenesis studies to investigate the molecular determinants of hMC4R responsible for α-MSH binding and signaling. α-MSH is a potent agonist at hMC4R but not at hMC2R. Cassette substitutions of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane regions (TM) of the hMC4R with the homologous regions of hMC2R were performed and α-MSH binding and signaling were examined. Our results indicate that each chimeric receptor was expressed at the cell surface and the expression levels remain similar to that of the wild-type receptor. The cassette substitutions of the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth TMs of the hMC4R with homologous regions of the hMC2R did not significantly alter α-MSH binding affinity and potency except substitution of the TM3 of the hMC4R, suggesting that the conserved residues in TMs of the hMC4R are crucial for α-MSH binding and signaling. Further mutagenesis studies indicate that conserved residues Glu100 in TM2, Asp122, Asp126 in TM3 and Trp258, Phe261, His264 in TM6 are involved in α-MSH binding and signaling. In conclusion, our results suggest that the conserved residues in the TM2, TM3, and TM6 of the hMC4R are responsible for α-MSH binding and signaling.

MC4R is a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors and consists of a single polypeptide featuring seven α-helical transmembrane domains (TMs), an extracellular N terminus, three extracellular loops, three intracellular loops, and an intracellular C terminus. Pharmacologic studies have identified that the tripeptide Phe7-Arg8-Trp9 in α-MSH is the minimal active fragment retaining biological activity at MC4R (85). The ligand receptor interaction between α-MSH and MC4R has been extensively studied based on the model generated by computer (19Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R.

In this study, we utilize both chimeric receptor and site-directed mutagenesis study to determine the molecular basis of hMC4R responsible for α-MSH binding and signaling. Both hMC4R and hMC2R are subtypes of the melanocortin receptor family and share a number of structural, functional, and pharmacological similarities. In the putative TM regions, both hMC4R and hMC2R show overall identities of 58% and similarities of 91%. They have high binding affinities for agonist ACTH and antagonist agouti signaling protein. However, hMC4R and hMC2R exhibit a number of pharmacologic differences (25Yang Y.K. Ollmann M.M. Wilson B.D. Dickinson C. Yamada T. Barsh G.S. Gantz I. Mol.

Endogenous agonists, α-MSH, β-MSH, and γ-MSH, are potent agonists at MC4R but not at hMC2R. Agouti-related protein is a potent antagonist for hMC4R but not at MC2R. Therefore, MC2R is a good candidate to determine the molecular determinants of hMC4R responsible for α-MSH binding and signaling. Our results indicate that six conserved amino acid residues in TM2, TM3, and TM6 of the hMC4R are crucial for MSH binding and signaling. [Nle4-d-Phe7]-MSH (NDP-α-MSH), an analogue of α-MSH, was purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). 3-Isobutylmethylxanthine was from Sigma and [125I]NDP-MSH was from Amersham Biosciences. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Lipofectamine were from Invitrogen. Construction of Melanocoritn Receptor Chimeric Receptors—The amino acid sequences of the hMC2R and hMC4R were examined by hydrophobicity plot (Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, WI) and manually by comparing their sequences to a previously published alignment of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor α-helices (28Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). A sequence comparison of the transmembrane domains of the hMC2R and hMC4R is shown in Fig. 1. The chimeras utilized in these studies are schematically diagramed in Fig. 2. The chimeric receptors were constructed by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (29Yang Y.K.

During an initial round of PCR, partial-length receptor fragments were generated. The sequence of one of the PCR primer oligonucleotides consisted of the transmembrane domain of interest, which was then coupled to a portion of the extracellular domain required to form the chimeric receptor. The second oligonucleotide primer consisted of the 5′ or 3′ end of the MC4R. Receptor fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and used in a second round of PCR in which full-length chimeric receptor constructs were assembled by cycling the appropriate fragments together for 10 cycles prior to adding both 5′ and 3′ receptor primers. The chimeric receptors were subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen).FIGURE 2Schematic representation of the chimeric hMCRs utilized in these studies.

The mutated receptors are shown in Fig. 5. The mutant receptors were then subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transfection—The OS3 cell line was used for hMC4R, hMC2R, and chimeric receptor transfection. The cells transfected with receptor were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine fetal serum and HEPES. Cells at 80% confluence were washed twice, and the receptor constructs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) (30Yang Y. Dickinson C. Haskell-Luevano C. Gantz I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23000-23010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Binding Assays—Binding experiments were performed using the conditions previously described (19Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, after removal of the media, cells were incubated with non-radioligand NDP-MSH from 10–10 to 10–6 m in 0.5 ml of minimal essential medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 2 × 105 cpm of 125I-NDP-MSH for 1 h. The binding reactions were terminated by removing the media and washing the cells twice with minimal essential medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then lysed with 0.2 n NaOH, and the radioactivity in the lysate was quantified in an analytical γ-counter (PerkinElmer). Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the amount of 125I label bound on the cells in the presence of 10–6 m excess unlabeled ligand. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecifically bound radioactivity from total bound radioactivity. Binding data are reported as Bmax and IC50. cAMP Assay—Cellular cAMP generation was measured using a competitive binding assay kit (TRK 432, Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, cell culture media was removed, and cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution, containing the melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH (10–10-10–6 m), for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10–3 m isobutylmethylxanthine. The reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold 100% ethanol (500 μl/well). cAMP content was measured as previously described, according to instructions accompanying the assay kit (25Yang Y.K.

Biochem. 2004; 92: 387-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)—hMC4R-transfected cells were harvested using 0.2% EDTA and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Aliquots of 3 × 106 cells were centrifuged and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The cells were incubated with 50 μlof 10 μg/ml murine anti-FLAG M1 monoclonal antibody (Sigma, catalog number 316) in incubation buffer for 45 min. Under this condition the primary antibody binds only to receptors located at the cell surface. The cells were collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were suspended in 100 μl of incubation buffer containing CY3™-conjugated Affinity Pure Donkey Anti-mouse IgG (ImmunoResearch Lab, Inc., West Grove, PA). Flow cytometry was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences FACStar plus six parameter cytometer/sorter with a dual argon ion laser). The results were analyzed using the software CellQuest (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Statistical Analysis—Each experiment was performed in duplicate three separate times. The mean value of the dose-response data of binding and cAMP production was fit to a sigmoid curve with a variable slope factor using non-linear squares regression analysis (GraphPad Prism, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant difference was assessed by one-way analysis of variance with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Substitutions of the TMs of the hMC4R with the Corresponding Regions of the hMC2R on NDP-α-MSH Binding—The binding affinity of NDP-MSH at wild-type hMC4 and hMC2 receptors was first examined. As shown in Fig. 3A, NDP-α-MSH possessed high affinity binding at wild-type hMC4R but not at hMC2R. To examine the ability of NDP-α-MSH to activate hMC4R or MC2R, cAMP production was determined. NDP-α-MSH dose-dependently increased cAMP generation at hMC4R but not at hMC2R as expected (Fig. 3B). To investigate which regions of the hMC4R are responsible for NDP-MSH binding and specific activity, a domain-exchange strategy was used to localize regions of the hMC4R responsible for NDP-MSH binding. Cassette substitutions of the TM2, TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM6 of the hMC4R with homologous regions of the hMC2R were performed (Fig. 2). The first and seventh TMs were not chosen for investigation because our previous data suggested that they were not important in NDP-MSH binding (21Haskell-Luevano C. Cone R.D. Monck E.K. Wan Y.P.

To determine whether chimeric receptor proteins are expressed at the cell surface and to quantify the receptor expression level we have utilized the antigenic epitope FLAG to examine the receptor expression. The FLAG sequence was inserted into the N terminus of the hMC4R using polymerase chain reaction. The FLAG protein is an eight amino acid peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) and has been widely used to determine protein expression by flow cytometry (33Mizoue L.S. Bazan J.F. Johnson E.C. Handel T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1402-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that FLAG signal fluorescence emitted by cells expressing the hMC4R-WT and chimeric receptors can be detected by FACs. The protein expression levels of the chimeric receptors showed no significant variation compared with that of the wild-type receptor (Table 1).TABLE 1Receptor domain exchanges of hMC4R on 125I-NDP-MSH binding and siganalingReceptor expressionNDP-MSH KiNDP-MSH EC50% WTnmhMC4R-WT1003.6 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.2hMC4R/TM2 hMC2R95 ± 11.57.2 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.3hMC4R/TM3 hMC2R97 ± 6.445.6 ± 11.2ap < 0.05 compared with WT receptor.32 ± 7.2ap < 0.05 compared with WT receptor.hMC4R/TM4 hMC2R92 ± 7.76.9 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.1hMC4R/TM5 hMC2R91 ± 5.55.1 ± 0.61.4 ± 0.3hMC4R/TM6 hMC2R90 ± 8.56.1 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.1hMC2R-WT100NoNRbNR, no response.a p < 0.05 compared with WT receptor.b NR, no response. Open table in a new tab To assess the binding affinity of ligand at these chimeric receptors, an experiment of unlabeled NDP-MSH to displace labeled 125I-NDP-MSH was performed (Fig. 4A). Our results indicate that these chimeric receptors did not significantly alter NDP-MSH binding affinity except for the chimeric receptor, hMC4R/TM3hMC2R, their Ki values are summarized in Table 1. To examine the ability of NDP-MSH to activate hMC4/hMC2 chimeric receptors, cAMP production was determined. Our results indicate that NDP-MSH increased cAMP generation in a dose-dependent manner at these hMC4/hMC2 chimeric receptors (Fig. 4B) and their EC50 values are shown in Table 1. Substitution of the hMC4R TM3 with the corresponding region of the hMC2R (hMC4R/TM3hMC2R) significantly decreased NDP-MSH binding affinity and potency. Their EC50 values are shown in Table 1. Mutations of the Conserved Amino Acid Residues in TM2, TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM6 of the hMC4R for NDP-MSH Binding and Signaling—The substitutions of the TM2, TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM6 of the hMC4R with the corresponding regions of the hMC2R did not significantly alter or abolish NDP-MSH specific activity, suggesting that a conserved amino acid residue of the MC4R TMs may be crucial for NDP-MSH binding and activity. Based on the model of MC1R, electrostatic and hydrophobic forces have been proposed to be involved in MSH binding and receptor activation (32Haskell-Luevano C. Sawyer T.K. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Bikker J.A. Humblet C. Gantz I. Hruby V.J. Drug Des. Discov. 1996; 14: 197-211PubMed Google Scholar), the conserved ionic and aromatic amino acid residues in TMs of the hMC4R were selected in this study. The conserved neutral amino acids isoleucine, leucine, and proline are therefore not included. Moreover, MSH is a 13-amino acid peptide and cannot access the receptor deep transmembrane region, the conserved ionic and aromatic amino acid residues in the upper region of the transmembrane regions of hMC4R are therefore potential candidates for NDP-MSH binding and signaling. A sequence alignment of hMC4R and hMC2R were compared and 15 amino acid residues in TM2, TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM6 are identified conserved between hMC4R and hMC2R in the upper regions of the transmembrane regions of hMC4R (Fig. 5). To determine whether these amino acid residues are involved in NDP-MSH binding and signaling, these residues were individually mutated with alanine and NDP-MSH binding affinity and potency were evaluated. Our results indicate that all of the mutant receptors were expressed at the cell surface and their expressions are shown in Table 2. The expression levels of mutations D90A, E100A, D122A, D126A, F261A, and H264A are lower than that of the hMC4R-WT. The protein expression levels of mutations M91A, S94A, S127A, S131A, T178A, F201A, F254A, and W258A are not significantly different from that of the hMC4R-WT. Receptor function study indicates that NDP-MSH dose dependently displaced 125I-NDP-MSH binding at the mutations of the amino acid residues, E100A, D122A, F261A, and H264A but their binding affinities for NDP-MSH were significantly reduced compared with that of the hMC4R-WT (Figs. 6A and 7A). Mutation D126A abolished NDP-MSH binding but remains weak signaling. However, mutations of M91A, S94A, S127A, S131A, T178A, F201A, M204A, and W258A remain with similar binding affinity compared with that of the hMC4R-WT. Consistent with the binding results, the mutations of amino acid residues, E100A, D122A, D126A, F261A, and H264A, significantly reduced NDP-MSH-mediated cAMP production but M91A, S94A, S127A, S131A, T178A, F201A, M204A, and W258A maintain high NDP-MSH-stimulated cAMP production (Figs. 6B and 7B).

The sequence of amino acids in TM3 between hMC4R and hMC2R was compared, and depicted in Fig. 1. A sequence alignment of hMC2R and hMC4R revealed that five amino acid residues are non-conserved in TM3. To determine whether these amino acid residues are involved in NDP-MSH specific binding and activity, these residues were individually mutated with alanine and evaluated. Our results indicate that these nonconserved mutant receptors were expressed at the cell surface and the expression levels showed no significant variation compared with that of the wild-type receptor (Table 3). NDP-MSH dose dependently displaced 125I-NDP-MSH binding at mutations N123A, I129A, S131A, C138A, and S142A, and their binding affinities were not significantly altered compared with that of hMC4R-WT. However, mutation N123D significantly reduced NDP-MSH binding affinity compared with that of hMC4R-WT (Fig. 8A). Consistent with the binding results, mutations N123A, I129A, S131A, C138A, and S142A did not significantly alter NDP-MSH-mediated cAMP production, but N123D mutation did greatly reduce NDP-MSH-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 8B).

Open table in a new tab We have identified six conserved amino acid residues in the TMs of the hMC4R that are crucial for NDP-MSH binding and signaling using both chimeric receptor and site-directed mutagenesis studies, Glu100 in TM2, Asp122 and Asp126 in TM3, Trp258, Phe261, and His264 in TM6 of the hMC4R. Hypothalamic MC4R plays an important role in the regulation of both human and animal food intake. The identification of the essential amino acid residues of the hMC4R responsible for MSH binding should provide important information for the understanding of the signaling events that regulate food intake and provide a rationale basis for the design of drugs for the treatment of obesity. Extensive studies have been performed to examine ligand receptor interaction between NDP-MSH and MC4R based on the receptor model generated by computer (19Yang Y.K. Fong T.M. Dickinson C.J. Mao C. Li J.Y. Tota M.R. Mosley R. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Gantz I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14900-14911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Haskell-Luevano C. Cone R.D. Monck E.K. Wan Y.P.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11329-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the computer-generated model for ligand receptor interaction has limitations for prediction of the ligand receptor interaction. The detailed information between NDP-MSH and MC4R remains unclear. Both chimeric receptors and site-directed mutagenesis have been widely utilized for determining the molecular basis of the receptor responsible for ligand binding and signaling. The chimeric receptor approach is useful for identifying domains of the receptors that are important for specifying the unique pharmacology of each receptor subtype, whereas site-directed mutagenesis studies are important for identifying residues that are invariantly important for agonist and/or antagonist binding (20Yang Y. Chen M. Lai Y. Gantz I. Georgeson K.E. Harmon C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20328-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Yang Y.K. Dickinson C.J. Zeng Q. Li J.Y.

Ther. 2004; 103: 21-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). In this study, we have taken each of these approaches to determine the molecular basis of hMC4R responsible for NDP-MSH binding and signaling. Melanocortin receptor subtypes are believed to have the same basic molecular architecture and we therefore utilized hMC4R and hMC2R to create chimeric receptors and determine the amino acid residue of the hMC4R involved in NDP-MSH binding. The hMC4R and hMC2R share a number of structural similarities. In the putative TM regions, hMC4R and hMC2R show overall identities of 53% identity. However, NDP-MSH is a potent agonist for MC4R but not for MC2R. Because the conserved amino acid residues in TM2, TM3, TM4, and TM6 of hMC2R are crucial for ACTH binding and signaling that is similar to that of hMC4R, the chimeric receptor experiment will provide important information of ligand receptor interaction. We anticipate that if substitution of TM of the hMC4R with the corresponding region of the hMC2R results in the decrease NDP-MSH binding affinity and potency, it will imply that non-conserved residues are involved in NDP-MSH binding and potency. In contrary, if substitution does not alter NDP-MSH binding affinity and potency, it will imply that conserved residues are involved in NDP-MSH binding. Our results support our theory that conserved residues in TMs of the hMC4R are crucial for NDP-MSH binding and activity because substitutions of the hMC4R TM regions with the corresponding regions of the hMC2R did not significantly abolish or decrease NDP-MSH binding affinity and potency. To determine which conserved residue of the hMC4R is involved in NDP-MSH binding, we have compared the sequences of hMC4R and hMC2R and found that only 16 amino acids in the TM2, TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM6 are conserved between hMC4R and hMC2R and these amino acids are therefore potential candidates for NDP-MSH binding. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of these conserved amino acid residues were therefore performed. Six among the 13 conserved amino acid residues have been identified to be crucial for NDP-MSH binding and signaling. These residues are Glu100 in TM2, Asp122 and Asp126 in TM3, and Trp258, Phe261, and His264 in TM6 of the hMC4R. Electrostatic and hydrophobic forces have been proposed to be involved in MSH binding and receptor activation at MCRs and 14 amino acid residues are proposed in ligand receptor interaction (19Yang Y.K.

Humblet C. Gantz I. Hruby V.J. Drug Des. Discov. 1996; 14: 197-211PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have utilized chimeric receptors to identify the conserved residues between MC4R and MC2R involved in NDP-MSH binding and signaling. Further mutagenesis studies narrowed down the amino acid residues crucial for NDP-MSH binding and signaling to six. Similar to hMC1R, our results suggest that an ionic binding pocket also existed in hMC4R. However, unlike MC1R, only TM6 of the hMC4R seems to be involved in a hydrophobic binding pocket. Mutations of the TM6 residues, Trp258, Phe261, and His264, decreased NDP-MSH binding affinity and receptor biological activity, whereas the other aromatic residues in TM4 and TM5 of the hMC4R do not seem to play an important role in NDP-MSH binding and receptor biological activity. Our results suggest that hMC4R shares ionic binding sites with hMC1R but have different binding sites from that of hMC1R. We have incorporated these results into the MC4R model and propose that both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces are involved in MSH binding and receptor activation (Fig. 9). An ionic pocket is formed by amino acid residues, Glu100 in TM2, and Asp122 and Asp126 in TM3, which are proposed to form an ionic interaction with Arg8 of NDP-MSH. A hydrophobic binding pocket is formed by three hydrophobic receptor residues, Trp258, Phe261, and His264 in TM6, which are proposed to form aromatic-aromatic interactions with Trp9 of NDP-α-MSH. In conclusion, we have identified that Glu100 in TM2, Asp122 and Asp126 in TM3, and Trp258, Phe261, and His264 in TM6 are important for NDP-MSH binding and signaling. These results provide important information about the molecular determinants of the hMC4R responsible for NDP-MSH binding and signaling. Download .doc (.04 MB) Help with doc files"

To date, there has been no direct evaluation of the dynamics in which tomosyn transits through tomosyn-SNARE complexes or of the extent to which tomosyn-SNARE complexes are regulated by secretory demand. Here, we employed biochemical and optical approaches to characterize the dynamic properties of tomosyn-syntaxin 1A complexes in live adrenal chromaffin cells. We demonstrate that secretagogue stimulation results in the rapid translocation of tomosyn from the cytosol to plasma membrane regions and that this translocation is associated with an increase in the tomosyn-syntaxin 1A interaction, including increased cycling of tomosyn into tomosyn-SNARE complexes. The secretagogue-induced interaction was strongly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of the Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase, a result consistent with findings demonstrating secretagogue-induced activation of RhoA. Stimulation of chromaffin cells with lysophosphatidic acid, a nonsecretory stimulus that strongly activates RhoA, resulted in effects on tomosyn similar to that of application of the secretagogue. In PC-12 cells overexpressing tomosyn, secretagogue stimulation in the presence of lysophosphatidic acid resulted in reduced evoked secretory responses, an effect that was eliminated upon inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase. Moreover, this effect required an intact interaction between tomosyn and syntaxin 1A. Thus, modulation of the tomosyn-syntaxin 1A interaction in response to secretagogue activation is an important mechanism allowing for dynamic regulation of the secretory response.

Tomosyn was originally identified in neurons as a binding partner of the Q-SNARE, syntaxin 1A (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y.

Tomosyn homologues also appear in the Fungi and Plantae kingdoms (34Pobbati A.V. Razeto A. Boddener M. Becker S. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47192-47200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Structurally, tomosyns are soluble proteins that contain two distinguishable domains. An R-SNARE homology motif near the C terminus defines the primary interaction of tomosyn with the Q-SNARE syntaxin 1A, whereas the remaining N-terminal region contains 7-9 repeating β-transducin-like WD-40 motifs that form additional protein-protein interaction sites (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y.

In the mouse genome, two paralogous genes for tomosyn exist (tomosyn-1 and -2) and lead to the expression of seven tomosyn isoforms (37Groffen A.J. Jacobsen L. Schut D. Verhage M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 554-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Variability between these tomosyn isoforms is clustered within a hypervariable domain that separates the N-terminal WD-40 repeats from the C-terminal SNARE domain. Functional actions of tomosyn family members have been ascribed to their interaction with cognate Q-SNAREs; however, as the lethal giant larvae family and Sro7p and Sro77p proteins do not possess a well defined C-terminal R-SNARE homology domain, interactions between these families and their cognate Q-SNAREs have been proposed to involve alternative interaction motifs (30Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 31Kagami M. Toh-e A. Matsui Y.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that tomosyn and its homologues are critical regulators in vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion processes. Overexpression of tomosyn in PC-12 and adrenal chromaffin cells negatively regulates neurotransmitter secretion (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S.

Tomosyn has also been shown to exert an important role in polarized exocytosis in yeast and epithelial cells (30Lehman K. Rossi G. Adamo J.E. Brennwald P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39Katoh M. Int. J. Oncol. 2004; 24: 737-742PubMed Google Scholar) to negatively modulate insulin release from pancreatic β-cells (40Zhang W. Lilja L. Mandic S.A. Gromada J. Smidt K. Janson J. Takai Y. Bark C. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and to interact with syntaxin 4 and SNAP23 and inhibit insulin-induced fusion of GLUT4-containing vesicles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (41Widberg C.H. Bryant N.J. Girotti M. Rea S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35093-35101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recent genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have also clearly established that Tom-1, the ortholog of mammalian tomosyn, exerts an inhibitory role on neurotransmitter secretion by negatively regulating synaptic vesicle priming (42Dybbs M. Ngai J. Kaplan J.M. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 43Gracheva E.O. Burdina A.O. Holgado A.M. Berthelot-Grosjean M. Ackley B.D. Hadwiger G. Nonet M.L. Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e261Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of tomosyn have been proposed to result from the formation of specific tomosyn-protein complexes that reduce the availability of interacting proteins to perform functional roles in exocytosis. For example, tomosyn has been shown to compete with Munc18 for binding to syntaxin, and, probably of greater significance, tomosyn competes with synaptobrevin for binding to syntaxin/SNAP25 dimers to form tomosyn-SNARE complexes (27Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The latter complexes, as shown by their resolved crystal structure, are almost identical to the synaptobrevin/VAMP-containing SNARE complexes (34Pobbati A.V. Razeto A. Boddener M. Becker S. Fasshauer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47192-47200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), including a required action by the ATPase NSF for complex disassembly and reuse of the interacting proteins (29Hatsuzawa K. Lang T. Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31159-31166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, whereas tomosyns can participate in the formation of stable tomosyn-SNARE complexes, the absence of a membrane anchor in all tomosyn family members precludes them from acting as fusogenic synaptobrevin/VAMP analogues. Rather, formation of these nonfusogenic tomosyn-SNARE complexes diminishes the availability and formation of fusion-competent SNARE complexes between membrane-anchored SNAREs, and it is this feature that has been proposed to underlie the negative regulation by tomosyn of exocytotic activity. The interaction of tomosyn with syntaxin 1A has recently been reported to be differentially regulated by the Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) (44Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Izumi G. Yasumi M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and protein kinase A signaling pathways (45Baba T. Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1113-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Activation of RhoA and its signaling effector ROCK facilitated syntaxin 1A phosphorylation and formation of tomosyn-SNARE complexes at the palms of growth cones in extending neurites in NG108 neuroblastoma cells and cultured neurons (44Sakisaka T. Baba T. Tanaka S. Izumi G. Yasumi M. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This resulted in the localized inhibition of functional SNARE complex formation in these areas and spatially directed fusion of plasmalemmal precursor vesicles to the leading edge of growth cones. On the other hand, protein kinase A-catalyzed phosphorylation of tomosyn decreased the interaction of tomosyn with syntaxin 1A and thereby up-regulated SNARE complex formation and enhanced neurotransmitter release in cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons (45Baba T. Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1113-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, although tomosyn is not essential for neurotransmitter release, its complex regulation suggests that it may play a critical role in integrating multiple receptor-mediated signaling pathways to ultimately achieve a fine modulatory control over the site and extent of secretory responses. To date, there has been no direct evaluation in living cells of the time course or extent to which the assembly/disassembly of tomosyn-SNARE complexes is regulated by secretory demand for neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, although a Rho signaling pathway has been demonstrated to alter tomosyn-SNARE interactions during neurite development, it remains unknown whether this signaling pathway operates to direct tomosyn-SNARE complex assembly during regulated neurotransmitter release. In this paper, we evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics and regulation of the tomosyn-syntaxin 1A interaction during stimulated secretion in neuroendocrine chromaffin cells. We show that activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, as occurs normally during neurally evoked secretory responses, as well as treatment with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), activates Rho-GTPase and increases tomosyn-syntaxin 1A complex formation at the plasma membrane in chromaffin cells. These effects of secretagogue stimulation and LPA treatment were inhibited by Y27632, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-GTP effector ROCK. We also show using dynamic FRET measurements between CFP-tomosyn and cYFP-syntaxin 1A that the formation of these complexes is strongly augmented under conditions where NSF action is inhibited, suggesting that a rapid and dynamic cycling of tomosyn-syntaxin 1A interactions occurs in vivo. Finally, we present functional data to demonstrate that LPA activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway during evoked secretion enhances tomosyn-mediated inhibition of secretion. Chemicals and Expression Constructs—pEGFP-C1 and monomeric mutants (A206K) of pECFP-C1 and pEcYFP-C1 (citrine) vectors containing the LoxP sequence were used as recipient vectors for subcloning using the Cre-recombinase-mediated Creator system (Clontech). Rat syntaxin 1A, m-tomosyn, SNAP25, and Munc18-1 were merged to the C terminus of the EGFP, ECFP, and EcYFP. Effector binding mutants of syntaxin 1A (I209A and I233A), a soluble mutant of SNAP25 (SNAP25c/a, C-80, 88, 90, and 92-A), as well as a carboxyl-terminal deletion of tomosyn-(1-1067) (tomosyn ΔCT, glutamate at residue 1068 changed to stop codon) were constructed using the PCR-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence fidelity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core). RhoA activation was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit (Cytoskeleton). HEK293 cells stably expressing the rat α1B and human β2B and α2δ voltage-gated calcium channel subunits (HEK293-S3 cells) were a gift from D. Rock (Warner-Lambert Parke Davis, Ann Arbor, MI). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless specifically indicated otherwise. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293-S3 cells were plated and cultured in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin, and 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin at 37 °C in 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 2 days on coverslips (thickness 1) attached to the bottom of 35-mm culture dishes before transfection. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. One hour before transfection, cells were placed into DMEM lacking antibiotics and supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. 4-6 h after the transfection, cells were returned to the RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were used for imaging 24-48 h after transfection. Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal glands using divalent metal ion-free rinse, collagenase digestion, and gradient centrifugation as described previously (46Li Q. Ho C.S. Marinescu V. Bhatti H. Bokoch G.M. Ernst S.A. Holz R.W. Stuenkel E.L. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 431-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and 10 μm cytosine arabinofurosemide. Three days following isolation, cells were transfected using biolistic particle bombardment according to the manufacturer’s instructions with plasmid DNA-laden (2 μg/mg of beads) 1-μm diameter gold beads (Bio-Rad). Cells were replated 4-24 h before imaging onto collagen coated glass coverslips. PC-12 cells were cultured in 10% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 1% gentamicin (10 μg/ml). PC-12 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 30 min before transfection, cells were placed in Optimem medium; cells were returned to the DMEM 4-6 h following transfection. Tomosyn Translocation Assay—Cells were serum-starved in DMEM/F-12 medium for 4 h prior to treatment with selected receptor agonists or signaling antagonists. Following the serum-starved period, medium was changed to physiological saline (PSS) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Treatments included incubation with LPA (10 μm, Biomol) or the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP; 20 μm), alone or in combination with the Rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632; 20 μm; Calbiochem). In Rho kinase inhibitor experiments, the Y27632 was applied during the serum-deficient preincubation period and to the PSS during agonist treatment. Each treatment was followed by an additional incubation (10 min) with the NSF-alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; 100 μm) prior to cell lysis. Cells were then scraped into the ice-cold lysis buffer containing 2% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 100 μm NEM, with a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/μl each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and benzamidine). The collected lysis buffer was then subjected to Dounce homogenization (20 strokes) followed by centrifugation (800 × g, 2 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclei. A membrane fraction was then extracted by ultracentrifugation of the samples at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, with the pellets resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 2 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1% Triton and the above mentioned protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal α-tomosyn antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was then performed on all samples that had been initially adjusted to contain equal starting amounts of protein and volume. Immunoprecipitation was carried out by overnight incubation with the antibody at 4 °C with rotation, after which Immunopure protein G beads (Pierce) were added, and the incubation continued another 90 min. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C) and washed in TNM buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Tomosyn immunoreactivity in the resulting samples was determined by SDS-PAGE fractionation and immunoblotting. Blots were probed with monoclonal α-tomosyn antibody and subsequently with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-mouse antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). Immunoreactive signals were developed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences), visualized using a FluoroMax Imager (Bio-Rad), and quantified from digital images using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Rho Activation Assay—Cells in 6-well plates (1.5 × 106 cells/well) were serum-starved in DMEM/F-12 medium for 12 h prior to use. Following the serum-starved period, medium was changed to PSS that contained LPA (10 μm; Biomol), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist DMPP (20 μm), or, for control, PSS alone. Following either a 2- or 10-min period of receptor activation, the medium was rapidly removed, and the cells were rinsed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Lysis buffer was then rapidly added, cells were scraped, and lysates were collected and immediately frozen in liquid N2. The relative level of RhoA activation with respect to control conditions was then measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Cytoskeleton). Each sample was assayed in duplicate, and each condition was repeated on at least three individual cell preparations. The level of Rho activation was calculated with respect to that of the control condition following subtraction of the assay blank. Human Growth Hormone Secretion Assay—PC-12 cells were plated onto 24-well plates and co-transfected with plasmids coding for human growth hormone (hGH), in addition to full-length tomosyn, tomosyn ΔC, or a neomycin control. The total concentration of DNA was held equal across all treatments. hGH was used as a reporter for regulated secretion specifically from transfected cells (47Wick P.F. Senter R.A. Parsels L.A. Uhler M.D. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secretion assays were performed 48-72 h following transfection. 16-20 h before the start of the assay, cells were placed in serum-free medium; where applicable, cells were pretreated with Y27632 (20 μm) 4 h prior to the start of the assay. To test secretion, cells were rinsed for 10 min in a physiological saline solution (145 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 15 mm NaHEPES, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mm sodium ascorbate, 2 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, pH 7.3) in the presence or absence of Y27632. Cells were then stimulated to secrete by a 6-min treatment with 70 mm K+ (same saline solution but with equimolar substitution of K+ for Na+). Where applicable, 10 μm LPA and/or (20 μm) Y27632 were added to the stimulus solution. The saline solution containing the secreted hGH was collected, and cells were lysed to determine the percentage of total hGH content secreted. hGH content was measured using an hGH enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). Each experiment was performed with quadruplicate replicates for each treatment. GST-Syntaxin 1A-Tomosyn Binding in Vitro and Immunoblotting—Soluble syntaxin 1A (residues 1-264) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. GST was expressed in a similar manner. Both proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma) binding and extensive washing. The bound GST or GST-syntaxin 1A were then incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with lysates prepared from PC-12 cells expressing EGFP-tomosyn or EGFP-tomosyn ΔCT. The lysis buffer contained 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science; PI Complete). The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed four times with phosphate"
https://openalex.org/W2010066826,"CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in epithelial cells with three or four extracellular domains (ECDs) and either long or short cytoplasmic domain isoforms. We have previously shown that the four extracellular domains, short cytoplasmic domain isoform, CEACAM1-4S, plays an essential role in lumen formation in an in vitro model of mammary morphogenesis. In this study, we transfected MCF-7 cells with either the long or short cytoplasmic domain isoforms of CEACAM1, and grew the cells in humanized mammary mouse fat pads in NOD/SCID mice. In this in vivo model, only the long cytoplasmic domain isoform, CEACAM1-4L, formed glands with lumen. On the basis of other studies that revealed phosphorylation of key Thr and Ser residues in the short cytoplasmic domain, we introduced phosphorylation mimic (for example, Thr or Ser to Asp) or null (Thr or Ser to Ala) mutations into the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-4S and tested them in the in vivo model. Mutation of either Thr or Ser to Asp or the double mutant Thr+Ser to Asp, but not the null mutants, induced gland formation with a central lumen-containing apoptotic cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation mimic mutants of CEACAM1-4S induced downregulation of β1-integrin, overexpression of β2-integrin, inhibited phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (pTyr-397) and resulted in myofibroblast differentiation as characterized by expression of vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin and β2-integrin, as well as the production of abundant extracellular matrix."

Adult parasites live in the bloodstream where they import nutrients such as amino acids across their body surface (the tegument).

Only a single member of the SLC3 family of glycoproteins that associate with gpaATs is found following extensive searching of the genomes of Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum. In this report, we characterize this schistosome permease heavy chain (SPRM1hc) gene and protein. The 72-kDa gene product is predicted to possess a single transmembrane domain, a (βα)8 (TIM barrel) conformation and a catalytic triad. Xenopus oocytes functionally expressing SPRM1hc with SPRM1lc import phenylalanine, arginine, lysine, alanine, glutamine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Biochemical characterization demonstrates that in Xenopus extracts and in schistosome extracts SPRM1hc is associated into a high molecular weight complex with SPRM1lc that is disrupted by reducing agents. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western analysis demonstrate that SPRM1hc is expressed in each schistosome life stage examined (eggs, cercariae, schistosomula, adult males and females). SPRM1hc is widely distributed throughout adult male and female worms as determined by immunolocalization. Consistent with the hypothesis that SPRM1hc functions to facilitate nutrient uptake from host blood, immunogold electron microscopy confirms that the protein is distributed on the host-interactive tegumental membranes.

Schistosomes are parasitic platyhelminths that currently infect several hundred million people globally (1Chitsulo L. Engels D. Montresor A. Savioli L. Acta. Trop. 2000; 77: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). The World Health Organization estimates that about a billion people are at risk of exposure (2Bergquist R. Al-Sherbiny M. Barakat R. Olds R. Acta. Trop. 2002; 82: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Schistosomes also infect livestock and cause serious economic hardship in many developing nations. The disease is characterized by the presence of adult worms, or blood flukes, within the portal and mesenteric veins. These worms, living as male/female pairs, can survive for many years during which time the female produces hundreds of eggs per day. The primary pathological consequences of schistosome infection are the host immunological response to these eggs within host tissues (3Warren K.S. Immunol. Rev. 1982; 61: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Adult schistosomes, within the vertebrate blood stream, can feed in two ways. First, they can ingest blood through the mouth and into the gut where a battery of enzymes breaks down the material. Second, they can import nutrients directly across their body surface (or tegument) (4Fripp P.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1967; 23: 893-898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Asch H.L. Read C.P. Exp.

The schistosome tegument is an unusual structure, being enclosed by two closely apposed lipid bilayers in the form of a normal plasma membrane overlain by a membrane-like secretion called the membranocalyx (8Wilson R.A. Barnes P.E. Parasitology. 1974; 68: 239-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because the tegument lacks lateral membranes, its cytoplasm extends as a continuous unit, or syncytium, around the entire body of the worm (9Morris G.P. Threadgold L.T. J.

The tegumental cytoplasm is connected by numerous, thin cytoplasmic processes to interconnected, cell bodies (or cytons) that lie beneath the peripheral muscle layers; these contain nuclei, endoplasmic reticula, golgi complexes, and mitochondria (9Morris G.P. Threadgold L.T. J. Parasitol. 1968; 54: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 11Silk M.H. Spence I.M. Gear J.H. S. Afr. J. Med. Sci. 1969; 34: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). The import of nutrients across the tegument surface implies the presence of nutrient-transporting proteins (sometimes called permeases) in the tegumental plasma membrane. Such nutrient importing proteins must be exposed to the nutrients in the host blood and, as such, should be available for chemotherapeutic or immunological assault.Several glucose transporter proteins have been identified in schistosomes (12Skelly P. Cunningham J. Kim J. Shoemaker C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4247-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and one of these, Schistosome Glucose Transporter 4 (SGTP4), is detected in the host-interactive plasma membrane of intravascular Schistosoma mansoni (13Jiang J.

Parasitology. 2001; 122: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Schistosomes synthesize a new tegument during invasion of their vertebrate host and SGTP4 is rapidly deposited into the surface of this new structure (14Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Parasitology. 2001; 122: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A second glucose transporter (SGTP1) is found in the basal membrane of the tegument where it likely facilitates the distribution of glucose from within the tegument to the internal tissues (17Zhong C.

Verrey F. Shoemaker C.B. Parasitology. 1999; 119: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This ∼55-kDa protein is found in both larval and adult schistosomes and in a variety of tissues (20Skelly P.J. Pfeiffer R. Verrey F. Shoemaker C.B. Parasitology. 1999; 119: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). When expressed within Xenopus oocytes, SPRM1lc promoted amino acid uptake but only when co-expressed with the human glycoprotein, h4F2hc (19Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In this context, SPRM1lc facilitated the transport of the basic amino acids arginine, lysine, histidine, as well as leucine, phenylalanine, methionine, and glutamine (19Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 20Skelly P.J. Pfeiffer R. Verrey F. Shoemaker C.B. Parasitology. 1999; 119: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The h4F2hc protein, acting as a chaperone, was necessary for SPRM1lc to reach the oocyte plasma membrane and function as an amino acid permease. A disulfide bond links h4F2hc and SPRM1lc (21Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). All characterized heterodimeric amino acid transporters function as obligatory amino acid exchangers (22Meier C. Ristic Z. Klauser S. Verrey F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 23Verrey F. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 445: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus the role of SPRM1lc can be viewed as that of equilibrating concentrations of amino acids across the membrane rather than as that of an influx transporter.Biochemical characterization demonstrates that, in schistosome extracts of all life cycle stages, SPRM1lc is associated into a high molecular weight complex that can be disrupted by reducing agents (20Skelly P.J. Pfeiffer R. Verrey F. Shoemaker C.B. Parasitology. 1999; 119: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the endogenous SPRM1lc is linked by a disulfide bond to the schistosome h4F2hc homolog. We call this protein the schistosome amino acid permease heavy chain or SPRM1hc. In this report, we clone cDNA encoding SPRM1hc and characterize the protein from this important human parasite.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasites—The Puerto Rican strain of S. mansoni was used. Cercariae were obtained from infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails and isolated parasite bodies were prepared as described (24Skelly P.J. Da'dara A. Harn D.A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; 33: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Parasites were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Adult parasites were recovered by perfusion and parasite eggs were isolated from infected mouse liver tissue as described (25Hackett F. Hyde J.E. Protocols in Molecular Parasitology. Vol. 21. Humana Press, 1993: 89-99Google Scholar).Identifying SPRM1hc and SjSPRM1hc—SPRM1lc functionally associates with the human protein h4F2hc when both molecules are expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In this work we set out to identify and characterize the schistosome h4F2hc homolog. Analysis of the S. mansoni transcriptome revealed one EST (designated SmAE 607755.1) with sequence similarity to h4F2hc (26Verjovski-Almeida S. DeMarco R. Martins E.A. Guimaraes P.E. Ojopi E.P. Paquola A.C. Piazza J.P. Nishiyama Jr., M.Y. Kitajima J.P. Adamson R.E. Ashton P.D. Bonaldo M.F. Coulson P.S. Dillon G.P. Farias L.P. Gregorio S.P. Ho P.L. Leite R.A. Malaquias L.C. Marques R.C. Miyasato P.A. Nascimento A.L. Ohlweiler F.P. Reis E.M. Ribeiro M.A. Sa R.G. Stukart G.C. Soares M.B. Gargioni C. Kawano T. Rodrigues V. Madeira A.M. Wilson R.A. Menck C.F. Setubal J.C. Leite L.C. Dias-Neto E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The EST encoded a partial sequence that lacked an initiator methionine. To most easily uncover the entire schistosome coding sequence, we used the EST data to search the S. mansoni genome assembly (version 3) for genomic clones containing the sequence. One match was found on contig 0011683. A comparison of the extreme 5′-end of the EST with the equivalent region of the genomic contig identified an inframe initiation codon just 15 bases upstream of the EST start. This identification of the 5′-end of the SPRM1hc coding sequence was confirmed by directly sequencing a PCR product obtained from adult parasite cDNA using oligonucleotides (Hc-6: 5′-TGTTCTATTGTCATCTACATTTTGTG-3′ and Hc-7: 5′-GTGAGGACAATAAAACCCGCGCC-3′), which span this region. The entire coding DNA was also amplified from adult cDNA using the following oligonucleotides: Hc-2 CGGAACTTTATCTGTTGTAGTACTGA and Hc-5: 5′-CTTGCAAGCGGTTAGTTTGTGTAAAG-3′. All amplified DNA fragments were sequenced at the Tufts University Core Sequencing Facility. The SPRM1hc gene was identified by comparing the complete coding sequence of SPRM1hc with the genomic contig containing this sequence.To identify homologs of SPRM1hc, the entire coding DNA was analyzed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68989) Google Scholar). In this way a single close homolog was identified from S. japonicum that was designated SjPRM1hc (GenBank™ accession number AAW26021.1) but the clone appeared to lack the N-terminal coding region. To identify further potential coding DNA, the S. japonicum genome data base, housed at the Shanghai Center for Life Science and Biotechnology Information, was probed for sequence that extended upstream of the available coding DNA. Several hits were obtained and one (TISJA01484276) was used to identify the likely 5′-coding sequence for SjPRM1hc. The following oligonucleotides were used with S. japonicum cDNA to amplify by PCR two overlapping fragments comprising the entire potential SjPRM1hc coding sequence: SjPRMhcfor1, 5′-CTATCATTTACATTTTGCAAGCGG-3′ with SjPRMhcrev1, 5′-GCATCCACCGCTAATAATTTTGG-3′, and SjPRMhcfor2, 5′-GGTCGTCCGAAAAATAAGAAAGG-3′ with SjPRMhcrev2, 5′-CACACAGAAGCGTAAATTTCAGC-3′. Both PCR fragments were purified and sequenced. Comparisons between SPRM1hc and related permease heavy chain sequences were undertaken using the UPGMA best tree building method, with gaps distributed proportionally, using DS Gene software (Accelrys Inc.).Functional Expression of SPRM1hc in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—To express SPRM1hc in Xenopus oocytes, the entire SPRM1hc coding DNA was first amplified by PCR using adult parasite cDNA and oligonucleotides, Hc-XO1 (5′-CGCCTCGAGATGAGTTCGAGCGGTACCAATGG-3′) and Hc-XO2 (5′-CGCGGATCCTCATTCACATTTGAAAACATATATCATAG-3′), using conditions as described (12Skelly P. Cunningham J. Kim J. Shoemaker C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4247-4253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Underlined sequences denote restriction sites; XhoI for Hc-XO1 and BamHI for Hc-XO2. Next, the PCR product was gel-purified, digested with XhoI and BamHI and ligated into the similarly digested Xenopus expression plasmid, pSDeasy. TOP10 cells were transformed with the ligation mixture and recombinant transformants were selected on agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmid was purified from several clones and the cloned inserts were sequenced. One plasmid, pNAA009, was linearized by digestion with PstI and cRNA was synthesized in vitro, as earlier described (19Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Tritiated amino acids were used in uptake experiments involving X. laevis oocytes, as previously detailed (22Meier C. Ristic Z. Klauser S. Verrey F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Background uptake was determined using oocytes expressing only the corresponding heavy chain (SPRM1hc or h4F2hc), and this value was subtracted to generate the data shown. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. (pmol/oocyte/h) of 13–42 oocytes from 2 to 6 independent experiments. Statistical comparison of means was carried out using one way analysis of variance and Tuckey as post-test when p < 0.05.l-Arginine was selected to monitor the concentration dependence of substrate transport in oocytes expressing SPRM1lc together with either SPRM1hc or h4F2hc. For this study, oocytes were injected with 1 ng of each cRNA and evaluated, as above, for l-Arg transport (at 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μm) after 24 h, in uptake buffer containing Na+.Biosynthetic Labeling of Oocyte Proteins and Immunoprecipitation—Non-injected or cRNA-injected oocytes were incubated in ND96 supplemented with 1 mCi·ml–1 [35S]methionine for 48 h at 16 °C. Oocytes were then washed twice with ND96 and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40; and protease inhibitors. Extracts were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was separated from the pelleted yolk granules and stored at –70 °C. Aliquots of 2 × 106 cpm were rotated for 16 h at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-SPRM1lc antibody (21Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) prebound to protein G/protein A-agarose. The beads were washed five times with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40; and five times with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The resulting immunoprecipitates were heated in SDS-sample buffer (with or without reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol)) for 3 min at 95 °C.Anti-SPRM1hc Antibody Production—The following peptide comprising SPRM1hc amino acid residues 615–633 was synthesized: NH2-IDQPVGSQRVYLKSDGQPM-COOH by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. San Francisco. This sequence is indicated in bold script in Fig. 1B. A cysteine residue was added at the amino terminus to facilitate conjugation of the peptide to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Approximately 500 μgofthe peptide-BSA conjugate in Freund's Complete Adjuvant was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits subcutaneously. The rabbits were boosted with 100 μg of peptide alone in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant 20, 40, and 60 days later. Ten days following this, serum was recovered from both rabbits, pooled and anti-SPRM1hc antibodies were affinity-purified using a peptide-ovalbumin conjugate and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, as previously described (15Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3642-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Membrane Preparation and Gel Electrophoresis—Membrane preparations from different parasite life stages were prepared, aliquots from each preparation were resolved by 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE. One gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and an equivalent gel and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as previously outlined (15Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3642-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with purified anti-SPRM1hc antibodies (1 mg/ml) at 1:300 dilution and bound antibody was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences) and the TMB Membrane Peroxidase system from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc, following the manufacturer's instructions. Blot images were captured using a Kodak Image Station 2000RT.Immunolocalization—Immunofluorescent detection of SPRM1hc in 7-μm thick, cold acetone fixed, adult worm sections was carried out using affinity-purified, rabbit anti-SPRM1hc antiserum and fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), essentially as described earlier (28Skelly P.J. Dougan P.M. Maule A. Day T.A. Shoemaker C.B. Parasitology. 2001; 123: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Immunogold Labeling and Electron Microscopy—Freshly perfused adult parasites were fixed overnight with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer at 4 °C. The samples were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol, then infiltrated and embedded in L. R. White acrylic resin. Ultramicrotomy was performed using a Leica Ultracut R ultramicrotome and the sections collected on gold grids. Grids were immunolabeled in a two step method according to the following procedure; the grids were conditioned in PBS for 5 min ×3 at room temperature, followed by the blocking of nonspecific labeling for 30 min at room temperature using 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS. After rinsing, the grids were exposed to the primary antibodies diluted 1:30 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing in PBS and then incubated with the secondary antibodies diluted 1:30 (10 nm gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L, Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature, and finally rinsed thoroughly in water. The grids were exposed to osmium vapor and/or lightly stained with lead citrate to improve contrast and were examined and photographed using a Philips CM 10 electron microscope at 80 KV.Developmental Expression of SPRM1hc by qRT-PCR—Relative SPRM1hc gene expression across different life cycle stages of S. mansoni was measured by TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems). The following life cycle stages were examined: eggs, cercariae, schistosomula, and adult males and females. The schistosomula were obtained after culture for 15 days in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamine, 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. First, total RNA was extracted from all parasites using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Next, 1 μg of total RNA, pre-treated with TurboDNase (Ambion, TX), was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using cDNA derived from 50 ng of total RNA and primer sets/reporter probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), custom synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). For SPRM1hc the following primers and probe were used: SPRM1HC3PM-HCP3F, 5′-GCTTTGGCTTCCACGTTTCTG-3′ and SPRM1HC3PM-HCP3R, 5′-CGTTTCCTCATTTAACTCCGAACCA-3′ with the FAM-labeled probe, SPRM1HC3PM-HCP3M1, 5′-FAM-CTTCCAGGCACTTCTC-3′; for the endogenous control S. mansoni triosephosphate isomerase (SmTPI) gene the following primers and probe were used: SMTPI-TPI3F, 5′-CATACTTGGACATTCTGAGCGTAGA-3′ and SMTPI-TPI3R, 5′-ACCTTCAGCAAGTGCATGTTGA-3′ with the FAM-labeled probe, SMTPI-TPI3M2, 5′-FAM-CAATAAGTTCATCAGATTCAC-3′. Probe positions were designed to span exon/exon boundaries to minimize detection of any contaminating genomic DNA. All samples were run in triplicate and underwent 45 amplification cycles on a 7500 ABI PRISM® Sequence Detection System Instrument. For relative quantification, the ΔΔCt method was employed (29Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (118788) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe SPRM1hc Gene and cDNA—Prior studies showed that the schistosome permease SPRM1lc is a member of the glycoprotein associated family of amino acid transporters (gpaATs) and requires association with a heavy chain glycoprotein belonging to the SLC3 family to function in Xenopus oocytes. The ESTs and the nearly complete genomes of S. mansoni and S. japonicum were extensively searched for homologs of h4F2hc or rBAT, representing the two classes of the SLC3 family of glycoproteins known to associate with gpaATs. Only a single putative SLC3 family member was identified that we named SPRM1hc (schistosome permease 1 heavy chain). A complete cDNA encoding SPRM1hc was obtained from adult schistosome mRNA by RT-PCR, which permitted characterization of the gene structure. A map of the SPRM1hc gene is shown in Fig. 1A. The gene is 6.56 kb, only one-third of which is coding sequence and possesses 9 introns and 10 exons. The first 6 introns are small (32–42 bp); the remaining 3 vary from 1.02 to 1.95 kb. All introns possess conventional GT:AG intron donor: acceptor sites and are composed of ∼65% A+T residues (range 60–75%). Exon size varies from 120–370 bp with ∼58% AT (range 54–63%). Searching schistosome genome and EST databases for additional homologs of SPRM1hc was unsuccessful. The GenBank™ accession number of the S. mansoni SPRM1hc cDNA reported here is EF204542.The predicted SPRM1hc protein is 640 amino acids long, with a molecular weight of 71,645 daltons and a pI of 5.05. A comparison of the SPRM1hc protein with homologs from other species is shown in Fig. 1B. The complete coding DNA of the homolog from S. japonicum was determined (and designated SjPRM1hc, GenBank™ accession number EF204543) and, relative to an earlier S. japonicum data base entry (GenBank™ accession number AAW26021.1), revealed several polymorphisms or sequencing errors (not shown). SmPRM1hc nucleotide and protein sequences are 80 and 79% identical to SjPRM1hc respectively. Not surprisingly, considerably lower sequence similarity is evident between the SPRM1hc protein and homologs from other organisms e.g. humans or Caenorhabditis elegans (all ∼20%). GenBank™ accession numbers of the related permease heavy chain sequences compared in this work are as follows: rBAT, AAH93626; h4F2hc, NP 001013269; Ce BAT (ATG1) CAB02316.All of these heavy chain proteins are predicted to possess a single transmembrane (TM) domain. In addition, the schistosome proteins are also predicted to display what is called a TIM barrel (because the domain was first identified in triosephosphate isomerase enzymes). TIM barrels assume a (βα)8 conformation. The positions of the α-helices and β-sheet motifs within the TIM domain of SPRM1hc shown in Fig. 1B were predicted by Network Protein Sequence Analysis (30Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). Both schistosome proteins also possess a potential catalytic triad (at position Asp278, Glu332, and Asp408, arrows Fig. 2). A conserved cysteine residue (Cys89, arrowhead, Fig. 1B) is predicted to cross-link this protein with its light chain partner (SPRM1lc) in the plasma membrane, as was demonstrated for the human transporter (21Pfeiffer R. Spindler B. Loffing J. Skelly P.J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A membrane topology model of the complexed heterodimeric amino acid transporter SPRM1hc with SPRM1lc (collectively called SPRM1), is shown in Fig. 2. This model of the SPRM1hc/SPRM1lc heterodimer is based on the 12-transmembrane domain topology proposed by TMpred analysis for SPRM1lc (19Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and on the fact that the extracellular cysteine residue involved in the disulfide bridge with the 4F2hc heterologous heavy chain is located in the loop between predicted transmembrane helices 3 and 4 (21Pfeiffer R.

The protein belongs to the Swi2/Snf2 family of ATP-dependent DNA translocases. We previously showed that yeast and human Rad54 (hRad54) specifically bind to Holliday junctions and promote branch migration. Here we examined the minimal DNA structural requirements for optimal hRad54 ATPase and branch migration activity. Although a 12-bp double-stranded DNA region of branched DNA is sufficient to induce ATPase activity, the minimal substrate that gave rise to optimal stimulation of the ATP hydrolysis rate consisted of two short double-stranded DNA arms, 15 bp each, combined with a 45-nucleotide single-stranded DNA branch. We showed that hRad54 binds preferentially to the open and not to the stacked conformation of branched DNA. Stoichiometric titration of hRad54 revealed formation of two types of hRad54 complexes with branched DNA substrates. The first of them, a dimer, is responsible for the ATPase activity of the protein. However, branch migration activity requires a significantly higher stoichiometry of hRad54, ∼10 ± 2 protein monomers/DNA molecule. This pleomorphism of hRad54 in formation of oligomeric complexes with DNA may correspond to multiple functions of the protein in homologous recombination.

At the synaptic stage, Rad54 stimulates DNA strand exchange and heteroduplex extension promoted by Rad51 through a different mechanism, dependent on ATP hydrolysis (10Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P.

Recently, we demonstrated that Rad54 protein binds with high specificity to branched DNA structures resembling Holliday junctions and promotes their branch migration in an ATPase-dependent manner (25Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). hRad54 showed the strongest binding preference for the partial X-junction (PX-junction) in which one of the four arms contained ssDNA (Table 1). A lesser preference was seen for other branched DNA substrates, including forked DNA and the X-junction. Given the importance of the novel branch migration activity of Rad54, we set out to examine the basis for the observed binding specificity of hRad54 and to further characterize the mechanism of DNA binding.TABLE 1DNA substrates used for ATPase assays shown in Fig. 1a Numbers correspond to the oligonucleotides in supplemental Table S1. Open table in a new tab a Numbers correspond to the oligonucleotides in supplemental Table S1. Proteins—GST- and His6-tagged versions of hRad54 protein were expressed in Sf21 insect cells (11Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GST-hRad54 was purified as described previously (11Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). His6-hRad54 purification was performed at 4 °C. Cells (10 g) stored at–80 °C were thawed and lysed by incubation in 10 volumes of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitors mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min with constant stirring. The crude extract was clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 60 min) (Fraction I) and loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (50 ml) equilibrated with T20 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), containing 200 mm KCl. The flow-through fraction containing hRad54 (Fraction II) was diluted with K20 buffer (20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) to 150 mm KCl and applied onto a 25-ml heparin column, which was developed with a 180-ml gradient from 150 to 1000 mm KCl in K20 buffer without EDTA. The hRad54 fractions (Fraction III; 35 ml; ∼300 mm KCl) were supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and loaded ona1mlof HisTrapHP column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed sequentially with K20 buffer without EDTA containing 500 mm KCl and 10, 20, and 30 mm imidazole. hRad54 protein was eluted with K20 buffer containing 500 mm KCl, 200 mm imidazole, and no EDTA. The eluate (Fraction IV; 2 ml), containing the bulk of the Rad54 protein, was further fractionated in a Superdex-200 column (58 ml), equilibrated with buffer K20 containing 500 mm KCl. hRad54 protein eluted from the S-200 column in a volume expected for a monomeric protein. The hRad54 eluate (Fraction V) was diluted with 4 volumes of K20, loaded on a Resource-S column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer K20 containing 100 mm KCl, and eluted with a 20-ml gradient of KCl (100–600 mm) in K20 buffer. The fractions containing hRad54 protein were analyzed for nuclease contamination, pooled (Fraction VI), and stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. The protein appeared nearly homogeneous in a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. DNA—All oligonucleotides used in this study (supplemental Table S1) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., in desalted form and further purified by electrophoresis in 6 –10% polyacrylamide gels containing 50% urea. The concentrations of the purified oligonucleotides were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients provided by the manufacturer. To prepare dsDNA or dsDNA with protruding ssDNA tails, complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides were annealed as described (26Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature Prot. 2006; DOI:10.1038/nprot.2006.217Google Scholar) and stored at –20 °C. Oligonucleotides were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, as described previously (12Mazin A.V. Alexeev A.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). dsDNA fragments longer than a 135-mer were prepared by digestion of pUC19 plasmid DNA using the following restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs): HaeIII to produce a 257-bp fragment; AluI to produce 521- and 679-bp fragments; ScaI and AflIII to produce a mixture of two fragments of 1373 and 1313 bp (designated as 1300 bp); and SmaI to produce a 2686-bp fragment (linear pUC19 dsDNA). 257, 521, and 679 dsDNA fragments were separated from the smaller fragments by a 6% nondenaturing PAGE and recovered as described (26Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature Prot. 2006; DOI:10.1038/nprot.2006.217Google Scholar). 1300- and 2686-bp DNA fragments were prepared by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. ATPase Assay—The hydrolysis of ATP by Rad54 protein was monitored spectrophotometrically as described previously (27Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The oxidation of NADH, coupled to ADP phosphorylation, resulted in a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, which was continuously monitored by a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrophotometer using UV-visible ChemStation software. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the rate of change in absorbance using the following formula: rate of A340 decrease (s–1) × 9880 = rate of ATP hydrolysis (μm/min). The reactions in standard buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate (unless indicated otherwise), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase (20 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (20 units/ml), NADH (200 μg/ml), and the indicated concentrations of Rad54 protein and DNA were carried out at 30 °C. In preliminary experiments, it was determined that 2 mm was a saturating concentration of ATP for all DNA substrates used in this study. Kinetic parameters of these reactions were determined using GraphPad Prism 4.03 software. Concentrations of free Mg2+ ion were calculated using WebMaxC2.10 (available on the World Wide Web) applying the following parameters: temperature, 30 °C; pH 7.5; and ionic strength, 0.05 (28Schmitz C.

After a 10-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 1 μl of 14.3 m 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 7.5% gels. The hRad54 protein was visualized by silver staining (Invitrogen). Branch Migration Assay—The hRad54 protein (100 nm, unless indicated otherwise) was incubated with 32P-labeled synthetic PX-junction (number 71/169/170/171) (33 nm, molecules), 32P-labeled synthetic X-junction (number 71/170/234/235) (33 nm, molecules), or 32P-labeled synthetic PX-junction (number 265/266/269/270) (20 or 30 nm, molecules) in a 90-μl branch migration buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 2mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, the ATP-regenerating system (10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase and 15 mm creatine phosphate), and the indicated concentrations of magnesium acetate. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C or in the case of PX-junction (number 265/266/269/270) at 20 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn, and DNA substrates were deproteinized by treatment with stop buffer (1.4% SDS, 960 μg/ml proteinase K, 7.5% glycerol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) for 5 min at 22 °C. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels (29:1) in 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA) at 22 and at 4 °C for PX- and X-structure, respectively. The gels were dried on DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman) and quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In hRad54 stoichiometric titrations, the initial rates of branch migration were determined using branch migration buffer containing 3 mm magnesium acetate. The reactions were carried out for 5 min at 20 °C. Time points were taken at 1, 3, and 5 min for each protein concentration tested. The initial rate was determined using the linear part of the kinetic curve during the first 3 min of the reaction. In some experiments, the ATPase regeneration system containing 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase (20 units/ml), lactate dehydrogenase (20 units/ml), and NADH (200 μg/ml) was used instead of the ATP regeneration system containing creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphate, with no apparent effect on the initial rate measurements. hRad54 Shows Binding Preferences for Branched DNA substrates with ssDNA Arms—Previously, we found that hRad54 shows DNA binding preference for branched DNA substrates (25Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). hRad54 possesses a dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity, which is essential for DNA branch migration and DNA translocation. Here, using the ATPase activity as a readout, we further characterized hRad54 DNA substrate specificity for a broad range of DNA substrates. We measured the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis of hRad54 protein in the presence of various branched oligonucleotide-derived DNA substrates over a range of DNA concentrations (Fig. 1). The results demonstrate that branched DNA structures (Table 1) with one single-stranded arm (PX-junction, 3′-flap, 5′-flap) stimulate the velocity (Vmax) of hRad54 ATP hydrolysis ∼1.5–2.0-fold greater than branched DNA substrates with fully dsDNA arms (X-junction, replication fork) or with two ssDNA arms (Kappa and forked DNA). The 3′-flap and 5′-flap structures containing two dsDNA arms and one ssDNA arm were nearly as efficient in stimulating the ATPase activity of hRad54 protein as the PX-junction, which was the best substrate among the previously examined structures (25Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Overall, our results show the following order of preference for DNA substrates according to their proficiency in inducing hRad54 ATPase: PX-structure ≥ 3′-flap ≥ 5′-flap >> Kappa ≥ X-structure = replication fork > forked DNA > dsDNA. Previously, it was shown that ssDNA supports the ATPase activity of hRad54 poorly (29Swagemakers S.M. Essers J. de Wit J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Structural Requirements for Branched DNA Molecules That Serve as Substrates for hRad54—To gain a better understanding of how Rad54 protein interacts with branched DNA substrates, we determined the minimal length of ssDNA and dsDNA regions of branched DNA required for efficient hRad54 binding and stimulation of its ATPase activity. Starting from linear dsDNA, we gradually increased the complexity of DNA substrates by constructing additional DNA branches and varying the length of the branches. To determine the minimal length of linear dsDNA that supports the ATPase activity of Rad54, we measured the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by hRad54 as a function of dsDNA concentration for each of a set of dsDNA fragments with lengths varying from 17 to 2686 bp (see examples in supplemental Fig. S1). From the obtained data, we determined the KM for each dsDNA fragment (K DNAm) (Fig. 2A and Table 2). The KM value decreases sharply from 61.6 to 0.62 μm with an increase of dsDNA length from 17 to 63 bp. The KM decreases slightly to 0.44 μm for 90 bp dsDNA fragment and levels out within a 0.3–0.4 μm range for dsDNA fragments up to 2686 bp long. At the same time, the velocity of ATP hydrolysis increases sharply with an increase of dsDNA length from 17 to 63–90 bp and then less steeply until it plateaus at 1300 bp (Fig. 2B). It was observed previously for T4 gp41 helicase that a sharp decrease in the K DNAm and concomitant increase in the ATPase Vmax occurs when the size of DNA approaches the DNA binding site size of the protein (30Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By this estimate, the apparent size of the hRad54 DNA binding site required for basal ATPase activity is between 63 and 90 bp. Based on the model of Peter von Hippel and co-workers (30Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the second phase of increase in the velocity of ATP hydrolysis for dsDNA fragments from 63–90 bp to 1300 bp at a constant K DNAm value was consistent with translocation of hRad54 protein along the dsDNA (11Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52042-52051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The Vmax data for these DNA fragments have been fit to an equation hyperbolic in DNA length (Fig. 2B). The DNA length at half-plateau height, 280 ± 30 bp, indicates the average translocation distances for hRad54 under tested conditions.TABLE 2The KMDNA of the ATPase activity of hRad54 as a function of the length of dsDNA substratesDNA lengthKMDNAOligonucleotidesaNumbers correspond to the oligonucleotides in supplemental Table S1.bpμm (nt)1762 ± 2917/182510 ± 1.4112/113324.3 ± 0.65/6483.4 ± 0.425/26630.62 ± 0.41/2900.44 ± 0.390/911350.40 ± 0.2114/11513000.38 ± 0.1pUC19 fragment26860.42 ± 0.1Linear pUC19a Numbers correspond to the oligonucleotides in supplemental Table S1. Open table in a new tab To examine whether an ssDNA tail attached to a short dsDNA fragment can enhance the ATPase activity of Rad54 protein, we constructed a set of tailed DNA molecules containing an invariable 32-bp dsDNA region with ssDNA oligo(dT) tails of various lengths. An oligo(dT) sequence was chosen, because it does not support the ATPase activity of Rad54; in contrast, ssDNA sequences of mixed base composition support some small level of ATP hydrolysis (29Swagemakers S.M. Essers J. de Wit J. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28292-28297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). 3O. M. Mazina and A. V. Mazin, unpublished data. We found that the velocity of ATP hydrolysis by hRad54 protein was increased by the addition of ssDNA tails to a 32-bp dsDNA fragment. The increase was dependent on the length of ssDNA tails, reaching a maximum, ∼4-fold stimulation, with an ssDNA tail of 45–60 nt (dT45 and dT60) (Table 3). The polarity of ssDNA tails (3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′) relative to the duplex DNA had no effect on the ATPase activity of hRad54 (Table 3). The presence of ssDNA in the DNA substrate appeared to be important for stimulation of the hRad54 ATPase activity, because in trans dT47 ssDNA inhibited dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity of hRad54 (data not shown). Previously, it was shown that ssDNA inhibits the ATPase activity of yeast Rad54. 4S. Kowalczykowski and C. Bornarth, personal communication. In contrast to a 32-bp dsDNA fragment, the addition of 32- or 45-nt oligo(dT) ssDNA tails to longer dsDNA fragments (62 or 90 bp) did not lead to a noticeable stimulation of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3). We suggested that ssDNA tails stimulate the ATPase activity of hRad54 mainly by increasing the overall length of short DNA substrates up to the DNA binding site size of hRad54. The obtained value for this site, 80–90 nt/bp, agrees with the estimate reported above for dsDNA fragments.TABLE 3ATPase activity of hRad54 with various DNA substrates of ascending complexitya For each DNA substrate, the rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined in a broad range of DNA concentrations up to saturation (see supplemental Fig. 1). hRad54 concentration was 60 nm. The kcat values were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.b Numbers correspond to the oligonucleotides in supplemental Table S1. Open table in a new tab a For each DNA substrate, the rates of ATP hydrolysis were determined in a broad range of DNA concentrations up to saturation (see supplemental Fig. 1). hRad54 concentration was 60 nm. The kcat values were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. b Numbers correspond to the oligonucleotides in supplemental Table S1. We further increased the complexity of DNA substrates by adding a second ssDNA arm to dT45-tailed DNA, creating forked DNA (Table 3). We investigated the effect of the length of this ssDNA arm on the ATPase activity of hRad54. We found that forked DNA stimulated the ATPase activity of hRad54 stronger than tailed DNA (Table 3). The highest stimulation, ∼2.5-fold over tailed DNA, was observed when the length of the second ssDNA arm was between 30 and 45 nt. Next, using the optimal forked DNA substrate, containing two dT arms of 45 and 30 nt, we determined the minimal length of the dsDNA branch required for the ATPase activity of hRad54 protein. The results showed that the dsDNA branch can be decreased to 12 bp without significant loss of the ATPase activity (Table 3). However, shortening of the dsDNA region to 8 bp decreased the velocity of ATP hydrolysis dramatically, ∼4-fold. The calculated melting temperature of the 8-bp duplex was 35.1 °C; therefore, it might become unstable at the reaction temperature (30 °C). However, even at 20 °C, forked DNA with a 12-bp dsDNA branch was a far superior substrate for Rad54 ATPase activity than that with an 8-bp dsDNA branch (data not shown). Thus, a 12-bp dsDNA branch in forked DNA substrate was sufficient for stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by hRad54. Shortening of the dsDNA region to 2 bp decreases the hRad54 ATPase activity to a very low level (7-fold lower than for an 8-bp dsDNA region), typically observed in the presence of ssDNA. We then constructed a set of 3′-flap DNA molecules with a 45-nt ssDNA arm (dT45 or mixed base composition) and two dsDNA arms (mixed base composition) of variable length (Table 3). When the length of both dsDNA arms was 15 bp, the ATPase activity (Vmax) was ∼1.6-fold higher than for the best forked DNA substrate (Table 3). The increase in length of dsDNA arms to 25, 37, or 45 bp did not increase the ATPase activity of hRad54 protein further or even slightly decreased it when the dsDNA arms were 45 and 32 bp. The sequence of the ssDNA arm in the flapped DNA was not apparently essential for the ATPase activity, since replacement of the dT45 arm with the ssDNA arm of mixed base composition did not significantly affect the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The decrease in length of ssDNA arm to 30 and 15 nt caused a decrease in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by hRad54 (data not shown). Finally, we constructed the PX-junction containing three dsDNA branches of 15 bp each and an ssDNA arm of 45 nt. The rate of ATP hydrolysis with this substrate appeared to be approximately the same as with the flap DNA described above (Table 3). Thus, in the course of analysis of a series of DNA substrates of ascending complexity, the flap DNA containing two 15-bp dsDNA arms and a 45-nt ssDNA arm, emerged as the minimal substrate that supports optimal Rad54 ATPase activity, about 15-fold better than 32-bp linear dsDNA. Henceforth we refer it as the “minimal flap DNA substrate.” The Stoichiometry of hRad54 Binding to the Minimal Flap DNA Substrate—Although on a gel filtration column, Rad54 protein elutes as a monomer (31Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol.

Here we measured the stoichiometry of hRad54 binding to the minimal flap DNA substrate. For this purpose, we measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis as a function of (i) DNA concentration at fixed hRad54 protein concentration (60 nm) and (ii) hRad54 protein concentration at fixed DNA concentration (30 nm, molecules). Since the GST domain is known for its ability to dimerize in solution (32Tudyka T. Skerra A.

The GLC7 gene encodes the PP1 catalytic subunit with >80% sequence identity to human PP1 and is essential for viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In yeast, Glc7p regulates glycogen and protein synthesis, actin cytoskeleton, gene expression, and cell division. We substituted human PP1 for Glc7p in yeast to investigate the ability of individual isoforms to catalyze Glc7p functions. S. cerevisiae expressing human PP1 isoforms were viable. PP1α-expressing yeast grew more rapidly than strains expressing other isoforms. On the other hand, PP1α-expressing yeast accumulated less glycogen than PP1β-or PP1γ1-expressing yeast. Yeast expressing human PP1 were indistinguishable from WT yeast in glucose derepression. However, unlike WT yeast, strains expressing human PP1 failed to sporulate. Analysis of chimeric PP1α/β subunits highlighted a critical role for their unique N termini in defining PP1α and PP1β functions in yeast. Biochemical studies established that the differing association of PP1 isoforms with the yeast glycogen-targeting subunit, Gac1p, accounted for their differences in glycogen synthesis. In contrast to human PP1 expressed in Escherichia coli, enzymes expressed in yeast displayed in vitro biochemical properties closely resembling PP1 from mammalian tissues.

In addition, more than 60 mammalian PP1 regulators have been identified (4Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Thus, cellular functions of PP1 appear to be dictated by complexes containing a catalytic subunit and one or more regulators that define its subcellular localization and substrates. Several mammalian regulators show preferential recruitment of specific PP1 isoforms. Thus, neurabins, which target PP1 to the neuronal cytoskeleton, preferentially interact with PP1γ1 (5Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Carmody L.C. Voltz J.W. Connor J.H. Li S. Smith F.D. Milgram S.L. Colbran R.J.

However, the structural determinants that promote selective binding of PP1 isoforms by regulators remain poorly understood. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is unique in that it is the only known eukaryote with a single PP1 gene, GLC7, which is essential for viability (9Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enabled mutagenesis studies of GLC7 that yielded an array of active PP1 catalytic subunits that helped to define the mechanism of PP1 regulation by mammalian inhibitor-1 (10Weiser D.C. Sikes S.

Expression of human inhibitor-1 in yeast also provided insights into the structure-function relationship for this PP1 regulator (13Connor J.H. Quan H.N. Ramaswamy N.T. Zhang L. Barik S. Zheng J.

As in higher eukaryotes, Glc7p regulates multiple physiological events in yeast, including glycogen metabolism (9Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sporulation (15Ramaswamy N.T. Li L. Khalil M. Cannon J.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 57-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transcriptional responses (16De Wever V. Reiter W. Ballarini A. Ammerer G. Brocard C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, analysis of GLC7 phenotypes provides a broad readout of PP1 functions. We utilized a gene replacement strategy to substitute Glc7p in S. cerevisiae with human PP1 isoforms. These studies established that human PP1 supported growth and viability of yeast in the absence of GLC7. Additional studies highlighted differences in the assembly of human PP1 isoforms into functional complexes containing yeast PP1 regulators, thereby accounting for their differing ability to control aspects of yeast physiology. These studies provided direct experimental evidence for distinct physiological roles of PP1 isoforms and highlighted structural elements at their N termini that may direct PP1 functions in eukaryotic cells. Most structural and biochemical studies of human PP1 have focused on enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli (17Chu Y. Lee E.Y. Schlender K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2574-2577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These Mn2+-requiring enzymes differ from native PP1 purified from mammalian tissues, which contains Zn2+ and Fe2+ in the active site, and show enhanced dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) (18Szoor B. Gross S. Alphey L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and impaired regulation by proteins such as inhibitor-1 (19Endo S. Connor J.H. Forney B.

Biochem. 1990; 190: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of these overexpressed proteins have severely limited the widespread use of these eukaryotic expression systems. Human PP1 expressed in S. cerevisiae demonstrated biochemical properties more closely resembling PP1 from mammalian tissues than the enzyme expressed in E. coli, and provided a novel expression system that should greatly facilitate future mechanistic studies of this protein serine/threonine phosphatase. Materials—DNA was purified using QIAquick extraction, PCR purification kits, and QIAprep spin miniprep kits (Qiagen). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, and dNTPs (Invitrogen) were obtained from indicated sources. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Glutathione-Sepharose was from GE Healthcare, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Gold Biotechnologies. Phosphorylase kinase was obtained from Sigma, and phosphorylase b was from Calzyme Laboratories, Inc. Microcystin-LR was from Alexis Biochemicals. Protein concentration was estimated using Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Yeast Strains—Yeast strains (supplemental Table 1) were derived from the parent strain, KT1900, and were congenic with KT1112 (MATa ura3-52 leu2 his3) (22Stuart J.S. Frederick D.L. Varner C.M. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 896-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown on YPD (2% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% glucose) medium (BD Biosciences) at 30 °C except when noted. Complete synthetic medium (CSM) and media lacking specific amino acids were prepared with yeast nitrogen base (BD Biosciences), 2% glucose, amino acid supplement mixtures (QBiogene), and copper sulfate added when needed. Yeast strains were sporulated at 24 °C on solid medium containing 1% potassium acetate, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.05% dextrose. Strains transformed with plasmid pNC160 (JG1-15) lost GFP-Glc7p-expressing plasmid when grown on SC-Trp plates (which retained pNC160) and 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) (Toronto Research Chemicals) for counterselection. PP1 genotypes were confirmed by colony PCR and expression of Glc7p and human PP1 confirmed by immunoblotting yeast lysates. Strains with GLC7 or human PP1 integrated at the HIS3 locus were created by transforming JG24 with integrating plasmid pRS303 (pJG24-29) cut with BstXI within the HIS3 locus. Transformants sporulated and tetrads were dissected to select JG16-23 strains. Diploid strains, JG25-28, were obtained by mating isogenic haploid mutants. Haploid strains, JG40-49, were generated by integrating the PP1-expressing plasmid into the HIS3 locus of KT1900 and selecting strains for loss of the GFP-Glc7p-expressing maintenance plasmid by growth on CSM containing 5-FOA. JG50 was created by integrating pRS303 plasmid into JG51, and pRS316 plasmid was eliminated by growth on CSM containing 5-FOA. Expression Plasmids—Primers (supplemental Table 2) were utilized to generate mutant PP1 cDNAs that were inserted into expression plasmids (supplemental Table 3). The CUP1 promoter was used to express Glc7p and human PP1 catalytic subunits in yeast with the exception of plasmids derived from pJG24-29, which used the native GLC7 promoter and terminator (derived from p1855). Hemagglutinin (HA) tag was inserted into selected plasmids (pJG9, -11, -13, -15, and -17). Chimeras of PP1α and PP1β used two-step PCR with PP1α N and C terminus with overlapping PP1β catalytic core sequences (JAG143-146) and PP1α catalytic core with overlapping PP1β N or C terminus (JAG143 and -148 or JAG147 and -146). All PCR products were purified, cut with EcoRI, and ligated into pNC160. Fluorescence Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence of yeast was undertaken as described (23Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Log phase yeast, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in solution B (100 mm K2PO4, pH 7.5, and 1.2 mm sorbitol), containing ∼450 units of lyticase (Sigma) and 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, were stained with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science) at 1:200 dilution and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and costained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) or rabbit anti-histone H2A antibody (1:200) to visualize nuclei. Zeiss Imager A1 Axioscope was used with the images captured on Hamamatsu ORCA ER digital camera interfaced with Meta-Morph software (Universal Imaging, Silver Spring, MD). Yeast Phenotypes—Glycogen accumulation was estimated by patching yeast on CSM plates at 30 °C for 24 or 48 h. Plates were inverted over iodine crystals to stain glycogen and photographed. DH3 (deletion of glycogen synthase), EG328-1A (the parent strain), and WW10 (deletion of both PCL8 and PCL10) were used as reference for low, normal, and high levels of glycogen. Glucose derepression was performed as described (24Tu J. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6789-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at 30 °C under anaerobic conditions (chambers provided by Annette Golonka, Duke University). All yeast phenotypic studies were undertaken using at least six independent colonies. Yeast Glycogen Content—Quantitative glycogen assays were performed as described (25Francois J. Eraso P. Gancedo C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Culture growth was supplemented with 0.1 mm CuSO4 as indicated. Total glucose was analyzed using Amplex Red glucose assay kit (Molecular Probes). PP1 Catalytic Subunits—Recombinant PP1 catalytic subunits were expressed in E. coli as described (26Gibbons J.A. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Native PP1 catalytic subunits were purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (27DeGuzman A. Lee E.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PP1 catalytic subunits were partially purified from yeast strains. Yeast were grown at 30 °C to A600 of 0.6–0.8, and PP1 expression was induced with 1 mm CuSO4 for 3–4 h prior to sedimenting yeast by centrifugation. The yeast pellet was resuspended in YeastBuster Protein Extraction Reagent and THP solution (Novagen), which included protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and lysed as described by the manufacturer. Lysed yeast were subjected to centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and purified via heparin-agarose essentially as described previously (26Gibbons J.A. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most studies utilized batch elution with 0.5 m NaCl following extensive washing with 0.1 m NaCl and yielded PP1 catalytic subunits with 50–55% purity. Elution using a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m NaCl (26Gibbons J.A. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or affinity purification on Microcystin-Sepharose (supplemental Fig. 3) increased the enzyme purity to greater than 70–80%. Phosphorylase a Phosphatase—Enzyme assays were undertaken as described previously (26Gibbons J.A. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate—Dephosphorylation of pNPP required 10-fold more PP1 catalytic subunit than used in the above phosphorylase a phosphatase assays. PP1 catalytic subunits diluted into 20 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (Serva Electrophoresis), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Assays with PP1 catalytic subunits expressed in E. coli included 1 mm MnCl2. Assays were terminated with addition of an equal volume of 250 mm NaOH and analyzed at A410. Recombinant PP1 Regulators—GST-Gac1p, GST-Gip2p, GST-Pig2p, and GST-neurabin (NrbI) (residues 374–516) fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (5Terry-Lorenzo R.T. Carmody L.C. Voltz J.W. Connor J.H. Li S. Smith F.D. Milgram S.L. Colbran R.J. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27716-27724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). PP1 Binding by Regulators—Sedimentation of human PP1 isoforms from yeast lysates using GST fusions of targeting subunits was undertaken as described (26Gibbons J.A. Weiser D.C. Shenolikar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15903-15911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Bound PP1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Covance, Inc., or Roche Diagnostics). Immunoblotting with rabbit anti-3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) antibody (Molecular Probes) established protein loading. Immunoreactivity was quantified using anti-mouse AlexaFluor 680 (Molecular Probes) and anti-rabbit IR Dye 800 (Rockland) secondary antibodies, respectively, using Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-COR Biosciences). Yeast Strains Expressing Human PP1—Primary structures of human and S. cerevisiae PP1 (Fig. 1A) highlight a highly conserved catalytic core (filled bars) flanked by diverse N and C termini (open bars). To compare functional properties of the human and yeast PP1 catalytic subunits, we transformed GLC7: LEU2 (KT1900 and KT1901) strains with plasmids expressing HA-PP1 catalytic subunits under the inducible CUP1 promoter and selecting on CSM containing 5-FOA to eject the GFP-Glc7p maintenance plasmid. This generated strains that expressed individual WT human PP1 isoforms, a C-terminally truncated PP1α306, and chimeric PP1α/β catalytic subunits that substituted either N or C termini from PP1α into PP1β and vice versa (schematically shown in Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting yeast lysates with anti-HA antibody allowed for direct comparison of expression levels of all PP1 catalytic subunits (Fig. 2A). Quantitation using Odyssey showed that basal expression of HA-Glc7p was 4–5-fold higher than any human PP1 (Fig. 2B). Addition of 0.1 mm CuSO4 to media increased expression of all PP1s by 2–3-fold but not the control protein, PGK. Growth on media containing 0.3 mm CuSO4 resulted in a further 0.2–2-fold increase in human PP1, but the expression of HA-Glc7p was either unchanged on modestly reduced when compared with growth in 0.1 mm CuSO4. This suggested that there was an upper limit for PP1 expression beyond which viability may be compromised (28Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies that expressed GFP-Glc7p in yeast (29Bloecher A. Tatchell K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showed localization at bud neck and spindle poles. By contrast, HA-Glc7p was highly concentrated at nuclei (supplemental Fig. 1). Although cytoplasmic distribution was also noted, no immunofluorescence for HA-Glc7p was seen at bud neck or spindle poles. This may reflect the differing experimental strategies with the overexpression of GFP-Glc7p in the earlier studies compared with gene replacement used in this study. Compared with Glc7p, fewer yeast showed nuclear staining for human PP1, with PP1α most consistently localized to nuclei and PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 being excluded from nuclei in most cells. Although nuclear staining for human PP1 was variable, all yeast showed immunostaining for histone H2A. This suggested that as in mammalian cells, PP1 localization in yeast may be highly dynamic (29Bloecher A. Tatchell K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Differences in PP1 isoforms was also suggested by frequent nucleolar localization of PP1β and PP1α, PP1β and PP1γ1 at mitotic spindles and PP1β and PP1γ2 at bud scars. Growth of Human PP1-expressing Yeast—Analysis of growth of multiple independent colonies showed that yeast expressing HA-Glc7p grew essentially like control WT yeast (Fig. 3). By comparison, all yeast expressing human PP1 catalytic subunits grew more slowly. Among these, yeast expressing PP1α or PP1α306 grew most rapidly, and PP1β-expressing yeast grew the slowest. Similar results were obtained on liquid or solid media and rich or synthetic media (data not shown). Yeast expressing chimeric PP1 subunits, specifically PP1α/βC with C terminus from PP1β fused to the remainder of PP1α and PP1β/αN, containing the N terminus of PP1α, grew almost 2-fold faster than yeast expressing PP1β, PP1β/αC or PP1α/βN (Fig. 3B). These data suggested that deleting the C terminus (PP1α306) or substituting the C terminus from PP1β had little effect on the ability of PP1α to support yeast growth. Hence, PP1α-, PP1α306-, PP1β/αN,- and PP1α/βC-expressing yeast grew at essentially similar rates. By contrast, PP1α/βN, containing the N terminus from PP1β, grew more slowly and resembled yeast expressing either PP1β or PP1β/αC. These data highlighted a unique contribution of N-terminal sequences in PP1α and PP1β in directing yeast growth. Rank order of growth of yeast expressing Glc7p and human PP1 isoforms in media containing 0.1 mm CuSO4 was identical to that in media lacking CuSO4 (Fig. 3A). However, discernible reduction in growth of yeast containing HA-Glc7p was observed at 0.1 mm CuSO4 (∼15%) and 0.3 mm CuSO4 (30%; data not shown). As growth of untransformed or WT yeast was unaffected by either 0.1 or 0.3 mm CuSO4, this hinted at a growth inhibitory effect of high Glc7p levels (9Cannon J.F. Pringle J.R. Fiechter A. Khalil M. Genetics. 1994; 136: 485-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, growth on 0.3 mm CuSO4 no longer differentiated yeast expressing Glc7p from those with human PP1. We also generated yeast in which HA-PP1 cDNAs (behind CUP1 promoter) were inserted into an identical HIS3 locus. HA-Glc7p levels in the integrated strain were 3–4-fold higher than those expressing human PP1, similar to that noted above for plasmid-borne strains (data not shown). This suggested either enhanced translation or stability of Glc7p rather than gene dosage accounting for its higher levels in yeast. Most importantly, yeast containing integrated HA-PP1, either in presence or absence of CuSO4, grew identically to strains containing PP1-expressing plasmids (data not shown). When compared at differing temperatures, WT S. cerevisiae, like yeast expressing HA-Glc7p, grew effectively on solid media at 16 °C (Fig. 4A), 30 °C (Fig. 4B), and 37 °C (Fig. 4C). By comparison, yeast expressing human PP1, both WT and chimeras, grew slower with fewer colonies seen at higher dilutions at all temperatures. Yeast expressing PP1β, PP1α/βN, and PP1β/αC were notably impaired in growth at 37 °C, which was readily visible at lower dilutions. This highlighted the unique temperature sensitivity of yeast expressing PP1β and PP1α/βN α and suggested a key contribution of the unique PP1β N terminus to this phenotype. Ion homeostasis in yeast is known to regulated by Glc7p (30Williams-Hart T. Wu X. Tatchell K. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 507-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to WT and HA-Glc7p-expressing yeast, yeast expressing human PP1 catalytic subunits either failed to grow or grew slowly in media containing 0.1 m CsCl (Fig. 5A) or 0.9 m NaCl (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, strains expressing the chimeric PP1β/αN catalytic subunit showed significant growth on media containing 0.1 mm CsCl. Thus, the fusion of PP1β N terminus to the remainder of PP1α generated a unique human PP1 catalytic subunit that showed some capacity to regulate yeast ion homeostasis. Glycogen Accumulation in Yeast Expressing Human PP1—Glc7p is essential for glycogen synthesis (22Stuart J.S. Frederick D.L. Varner C.M. Tatchell K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 896-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and promotes the dephosphorylation and activation of yeast glycogen synthase. Thus, glycogen accumulation, visualized in yeast by iodine staining (Fig. 6A), showed that less glycogen accumulated in yeast expressing human PP1 than either control yeast or yeast expressing HA-Glc7p. Despite similar PP1 levels, yeast expressing human isoforms also demonstrated differing glycogen content. Specifically, PP1β-, PP1γ1-, and PP1γ2-expressing yeast accumulated more glycogen than yeast containing either PP1α or PP1α306. PP1α306-expressing yeast consistently showed a small increase in glycogen content compared with PP1α-expressing yeast, suggesting a potential negative role for PP1α C terminus in generating an active glycogen synthase phosphatase. Yeast expressing a chimeric phosphatase, PP1α/βN, showed increased glycogen content compared with PP1α-expressing yeast, demonstrating the ability of the PP1β N terminus to enhance the capacity of PP1α to promote glycogen synthesis. Conversely, incorporation of the PP1α N terminus generated PP1β/αN and reduced the activity of PP1β in promoting yeast glycogen accumulation. By comparison, PP1β/αC accumulated glycogen to similar levels as yeast expressing PP1β. These data emphasized the positive role for the N terminus in the ability of PP1β to regulate yeast glycogen. When yeast were grown on media containing CuSO4 to increase PP1 levels, the overall glycogen content in all strains was elevated, but this did not alter the overall conclusion, namely the N terminus accounted for the unique ability of PP1β to promote yeast glycogen synthesis. A quantitative assay that analyzed total glucose following digestion of yeast glycogen with amyloglucosidase (Fig. 6B) confirmed all the major findings discussed above. Most importantly, yeast expressing human PP1, in the presence or absence of CuSO4, accumulated 6–7-fold less glycogen than WT untransformed yeast or yeast expressing HA-Glc7p, highlighting the remarkable effectiveness of Glc7p to promote yeast glycogen synthesis. In the absence of CuSO4, yeast expressing PP1α or PP1α306 contained 5–10-fold less glycogen than yeast expressing PP1β, PP1γ1, or PP1γ2. With the exception that glycogen content in PP1α (and PP1α306)-expressing yeast was elevated in the presence of CuSO4 to levels comparable with yeast expressing PP1β and PP1γ2, increasing expression of other human PP1 isoforms had only modest effects on glycogen content. WT and HA-Glc7p-expressing yeast also contained similar glycogen levels in presence or absence of CuSO4. When grown in the presence of CuSO4, the glycogen content of yeast expressing PP1α/βN, PP1β/αN and PP1β/αC was identical, whereas PP1α/βC-expressing yeast accumulated 50% less glycogen. This also demonstrated that the unique deficiency of PP1α in promoting glycogen synthesis could be overcome by elevating PP1α (or PP1α306) expression in yeast. Binding of Human PP1 to Yeast PP1 Regulators—Gac1p is the primary PP1 targeting subunit controlling yeast glycogen synthesis (32Cheng C. Huang D. Roach P."

Rab5 has been shown to play an important role in the early stages of EGFR trafficking. GAPex-5 is a newly described Rab5 exchange factor. Herein, we investigate the role of GAPex-5 on EGFR trafficking and degradation. Down-regulation of GAPex-5 by RNA interference decreases epidermal growth factor-stimulated EGFR degradation. Moreover, ubiquitination of EGFR is impaired by depletion of GAPex-5. This inhibitory effect is due to a decrease in the interaction between the adapter protein c-Cbl and EGFR, but not the phosphorylation state of EGFR. Consistently, when examined by immunofluorescence microscopy in cells depleted of GAPex-5, ligand-bound EGFR appeared trapped in early endosomes and the trafficking of internalized receptor from early to late endosomes was impaired. In agreement with the depletion studies, EGFR degradation is enhanced by overexpressing GAPex-5 wild type, but not GAPex-5ΔGAP, a mutant lacking the Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain. This is consistent with the finding that c-Cbl binds specifically to the Ras GAP domain. Finally, overexpression of dominant negative Rab5a or depletion of all three isoforms of Rab5 does not inhibit ubiquitination of EGFR, which suggests that GAPex-5-mediated EGFR ubiquitination is independent of Rab5 activation.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The strength and quality of signals generated by EGFR are dictated by both quantity and intracellular localization of the receptor. Although activated EGFR may stimulate downstream signaling molecules either on the plasma membrane or in signaling endosomes, its degradation has been shown to be important in prevention of excessive signaling and cell proliferation (3Dikic I. Giordano S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The trafficking of EGFR is tightly controlled by chemical modifications of the receptor. Upon ligand binding, the activated, dimerized EGFR autophosphorylates at multiple tyrosines within the cytoplasmic tail. These phosphorylated residues mediate the recruitment of multiple downstream effectors. c-Cbl, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, is recruited to EGFR where it then initiates the ubiquitination of the activated receptor (4Levkowitz G.

Activation of Rab5 is mediated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that promote the exchange of bound GDP for GTP. A large number of proteins have been identified as potential Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factors as they contain a highly conserved domain (Vps9) that catalyzes nucleotide exchange on Rab5. Thus far, in mammalian cells, the tried and proven Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factors include Rabex-5 (19Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H.M. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin V. Wilm M.

It is likely that the diversity of Rab5 functions is achieved by temporal and spatial regulation of different Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factors. GAPex-5 is composed of a C-terminal Vps9 domain and an N-terminal Ras GAP domain. It was originally found to mediate both fluid phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis in Caenorhabditis elegans via its interaction with Rab5 and was named RME6 (28Sato M. Sato K. Fonarev P. Huang C.J. Liou W. Grant B.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mammalian ortholog was initially identified by Hunker et al. (27Hunker C.M. Galvis A. Kruk I. Giambini H. Veisaga M.L. Barbieri M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and called RAP6. The exchange activity of RME6/GAPex-5/RAP6 for Rab5 was demonstrated using purified components (27Hunker C.M. Galvis A. Kruk I. Giambini H. Veisaga M.L. Barbieri M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that GAPex-5 mediates insulin-stimulated fluid phase endocytosis and insulin receptor internalization via a Rab5-dependent pathway (25Su X. Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Hunker C.M. Galvis A. Kruk I. Giambini H. Veisaga M.L. Barbieri M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because the internalization of both EGFR and insulin receptor is mediated by Rab5, we postulated that GAPex-5 may mediate EGFR internalization via activation of Rab5. However, our recent study demonstrated that Rin1 mediates EGFR trafficking from early endosomes to MVB/late endosomes via interacting with STAM (29Kong C. Su X. Chen P.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Rab5 exchange factors may mediate EGFR trafficking via a Rab5-independent pathway. Because GAPex-5 has been shown to have plasma membrane localization, it seemed possible that it may also affect the post-ligand binding processing of EGFR (e.g. phosphorylation and ubiquitination) before internalization. Herein, we examined the effects of GAPex-5 on EGFR degradation and uncovered a role for GAPex-5 in the ubiquitination and trafficking of EGFR. Materials—Fetal calf serum, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, and Lipofectamine™ 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. Rabbit anti-EGFR and mouse anti-HA antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse anti-ubiquitin and mouse anti-EGFR (AB-5) antibodies were from Invitrogen, and mouse anti-c-Cbl antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-EGFR (pY1045-specific) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Mouse anti-EEA1, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), and anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. Mouse anti-CD63 antibody was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa. Anti-GAPex-5 polyclonal antibody and GAPex-5 constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Saltiel (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). Cell Culture and Stimulation with EGF—HeLa and human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. CHO cells overexpressing human EGFR (CHO/hEGFR) were cultured in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were serum-starved and stimulated with prewarmed serum-free medium containing EGF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time at 37 °C. Protein Extraction, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described (25Su X. Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of clarified lysate protein was incubated with antibodies (0.5 μg) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer before solubilization in SDS sample loading buffer. Released proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (25Su X. Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). siRNA Construction and Transfection—The siRNA-directed human GAPex-5 were constructed and purified employing the Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as previously described (25Su X. Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One day before transfection, HeLa cells were plated in growth medium without antibiotics to obtain 30 ∼ 40% confluence at the time of transfection. The transfection of siRNA (20 nm final concentration) was performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences specific for human GAPex-5 (5′-AAGAATCGATTACCTATAGCA-3′), human Rab5a (5′-GAGTCCGCTGTTGGCAAATCA-3′), human Rab5b (5′-AAGACAGCTATGAACGTGAAT-3′), and human Rab5c (5′-AATGAACGTGAACGAAATCTT-3′) were selected based upon their potency to inhibit the target gene expression. A scrambled siRNA (Ambion) was used as a negative control. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscope Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 20 min and quenched for 10 min with 50 mm ammonium chloride. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 2% goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h, followed by Alexa-Fluor 594- or 488-goat anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted with Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Imagines were collected using a MRC1024 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a ×63 objective (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Expression of Rab5a:S34N in CHO/hEGFR Cells by Recombinant Sindbis Virus—Recombinant Sindbis virus expressing Rab5a:S34N was constructed as previously described (30Li G. Barbieri M.A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO/hEGFR cell monolayers in 35-mm dishes (5 × 106 cell/dish) were infected with recombinant Sindbis virus as described (30Li G. Barbieri M.A. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14631-14635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Four hours post-infection, cells were starved and stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml). Whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described above. EGF Internalization Assay—HeLa cells pretreated with siRNAs were serum-starved for 4 h prior to incubation with EGF as described (31Barbieri M.A. Kong C. Chen P.I. Horazdovsky B.F. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32027-32036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in cold binding buffer (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 200 pm 125I-EGF (Amersham Biosciences). To assess internalization, the cells were incubated at 37 °C in binding buffer lacking 125I-EGF for 5 min. Acid wash samples (surface-bound fractions) and cell lysates (internalized fractions) were counted in a γ-counter. Depletion of GAPex-5 Inhibits EGFR Degradation—GAPex-5 is a newly identified Rab5 exchange factor, and we have recently demonstrated that its depletion inhibits insulin receptor internalization and signaling (25Su X. Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Because EGFR and insulin receptor follow similar endocytic itineraries upon stimulation, we examined the effect of GAPex-5 depletion on EGFR internalization. The expression of GAPex-5 was effectively inhibited by an siRNA against GAPex-5 in HeLa cells (>90%, Fig. 1A). Down-regulation of GAPex-5 decreased the internalization rate of 125I-EGF by 30 ∼ 40% (p < 0.05, Fig. 1B). Previous study demonstrated that depletion of all three Rab5 isoforms in HeLa cells decreased 125I-EGF internalization rate by ∼50% (32Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that GAPex-5 is an exchange factor for Rab5 (27Hunker C.M. Galvis A. Kruk I. Giambini H. Veisaga M.L. Barbieri M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and Rab5 activity is required for EGFR internalization (13Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that GAPex-5 may mediate EGF internalization through a Rab5-dependent pathway. Receptor internalization is the first step of EGFR trafficking from plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. However, whether a decrease of receptor internalization may affect EGFR degradation depends on whether internalization is the rate-limiting step under particular biological conditions. We therefore examined whether EGFR degradation was affected by down-regulation of GAPex-5. Indeed, EGF-stimulated EGFR degradation was significantly delayed when GAPex-5 was depleted (Fig. 1, C and D). Collectively, these results indicate that GAPex-5 regulates EGFR internalization and its trafficking to degradative compartments. Depletion of GAPex-5 Inhibits EGFR Ubiquitination, but Not Phosphorylation Status—EGFR internalization is necessary, but not sufficient, for degradation. Previous studies demonstrated the important role of receptor ubiquitination and deubiquitination on intracellular trafficking and degradation of EGFR (12Clague M.J. Urbe S. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). To examine whether GAPex-5 mediates EGFR ubiquitination, HeLa cells transfected with scrambled negative control siRNA or a siRNA against GAPex-5 were starved and stimulated with EGF. The cells were lysed, and whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody recognizing EGFR. The resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting. In cells transfected with scrambled siRNA, EGF dramatically stimulates EGFR ubiquitination after 5 min (Fig. 2). Twenty minutes later, EGFR ubiquitination was found to be decreased, consistent with the sequential process of deubiquitination and trafficking of EGFR from early to late endosomes (Fig. 2). Interestingly, down-regulation of GAPex-5 dramatically inhibits EGF-stimulated receptor ubiquitination at 5 min (Fig. 2). The interaction between ubiquitin E3 ligase c-Cbl and activated EGFR is known to be required for the ubiquitination of EGFR (8Duan L. Miura Y. Dimri M. Majumder B. Dodge I.L. Reddi A.L. Ghosh A. Fernandes N. Zhou P. Mullane-Robinson K. Rao N. Donoghue S. Rogers R.A. Bowtell D. Naramura M. Gu H. Band V. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28950-28960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore examined their interaction and found that depletion of GAPex-5 dramatically inhibits EGF-stimulated recruitment of c-Cbl to the EGFR (Fig. 2). Because tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR occurs before the recruitment of c-Cbl (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), we analyzed EGFR phosphorylation after stimulation. Five minutes after stimulation, cells depleted of GAPex-5 had similar amounts of total phospho-tyrosine (as analyzed with PY20 antibody) in EGFR as cells treated with scrambled control (Fig. 2). At 20 min, the amount of phosphotyrosine in control cells decreased. However, this decrease was delayed by depletion of GAPex-5. The delayed decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation may be due to either delayed receptor trafficking (Fig. 1, C and D) or failure to recruit phosphatases to the activated EGFR. Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates using an antibody recognizing EGFR specifically phosphorylated at tyrosine 1045 also confirmed the delayed dephosphorylation of EGFR in cells depleted of GAPex-5 (Fig. 2). Given that depletion of GAPex-5 decreases the internalization rate of EGFR (Fig. 1B), these results indicate that intracellular compartments may play an important role in EGFR dephosphorylation and signal attenuation. Previously, studies suggested that different effectors are recruited to activate EGFR via the interaction between their Src homology 2 domains or phospho-tyrosine binding domains and distinct phosphorylated tyrosines within the tail of the EGFR. Phosphorylated tyrosines 1045, 1068, and 1086 have been shown to play important roles in recruiting c-Cbl (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K.

Cell Res. 2004; 300: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylated tyrosines 992 and 1173 are involved in the binding of phospholipase C-γ1 (35Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M. Ji Q. Mernaugh R. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26091-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1 to EGFR results in production of the second messenger molecules (e.g. inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol) and plays a significant role in intracellular signaling (36Carpenter G. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To further confirm that the effect of GAPex-5 depletion on effector recruitment is specific to Cbl, we examined the recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1. Interestingly, down-regulation of GAPex-5 did not inhibit recruitment of phospholipase C-γ1 to the activated EGFR (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results suggest that GAPex-5 mediates the recruitment of c-Cbl to EGFR via a mechanism independent of receptor phosphorylation. Depletion of GAPex-5 Blocks the Trafficking of EGFR from Early Endosomes to MVB and Late Endocytic Compartments—EGFR ubiquitination and deubiquitination are temporally and spatially coordinated as EGFR traverses the degradative pathway (12Clague M.J. Urbe S. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because depletion of GAPex-5 inhibits EGFR recruitment of c-Cbl, we further studied its effect on intracellular trafficking of EGFR by light microscopy. HeLa cells, transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNA against GAPex-5, were starved and stimulated with EGF. Ten minutes post-stimulation, cells were fixed and EGFR and EEA1 were examined by confocal microscopy. Significant co-localization between EGFR and EEA1 was observed regardless of GAPex-5 depletion (Fig. 3A). However, in cells treated with GAPex-5 siRNA, EEA1-positive endosomes appeared smaller and more peripherally distributed than those in cells transfected with scrambled siRNA. These results may be indicative of impaired Rab5 activity and strongly suggest that GAPex-5 operates as an exchange factor for Rab5. Thirty minutes after EGF stimulation, EGFR co-localizes with CD63 (a marker for MVB and late endosome) significantly (Fig. 3B). However, in cells depleted of GAPex-5, a substantial subset of EGFR does not co-localize with CD63. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GAPex-5 is required for trafficking of EGFR from early endosomes to MVB/late endosome. GAPex-5-mediated EGFR Degradation Is Regulated via its Ras GAP Domain—One possible mechanism for the inhibitory effects of GAPex-5 depletion on the interaction between c-Cbl and EGFR in the absence of an effect on receptor phosphorylation is through an interaction between GAPex5 and c-Cbl. To test this hypothesis, HeLa cells were transfected with empty vector or vectors encoding either wild type or mutant GAPex-5 epitope tagged with HA. After stimulation with EGF for 5 min, whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. The resulting immunocomplexes were examined by immunoblot analysis using an anti-c-Cbl antibody. Interestingly, overexpressed GAPex-5 pulls down endogenous c-Cbl (Fig. 4A). In contrast, a GAPex-5 mutant depleted of RAS GAP domain (GAPex-5ΔGAP) does not interact with c-Cbl (Fig. 4A), suggesting that this domain is normally required for interaction between GAPex-5 and c-Cbl. Moreover, c-Cbl was pulled down by glutathione S-transferase-Ras GAP domain (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that Ras GAP domain of GAPex-5 is sufficient for its interaction with c-Cbl. We need to point out here that we do not consistently observe the interaction between endogenous GAPex-5 and endogenous c-Cbl in HeLa cells. This may be due to the quality of our GAPex-5 antibody and the expression level of endogenous GAPex-5 in HeLa cells. It is also likely that only a fraction of GAPex-5 interacts with c-Cbl. To address the function of the Cbl-GAPex-5 interaction, we examined how or whether overexpressed GAPex-5 WT and GAPex-5ΔGAP affect Cbl recruitment, ubiquitination, and degradation of EGFR. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were co-transfected with green fluorescent protein-EGFR and empty vector, or vector encoding GAPex-5 WT or GAPex-5ΔGAP. Cells were starved and stimulated with EGF. The cells were lysed, and the whole cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody recognizing EGFR. The resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting. Overexpression of GAPex-5 WT, but not GAPex-5ΔGAP, enhanced the recruitment of c-Cbl to EGFR and receptor ubiquitination (Fig. 4C). We further examined the effects of GAPex-5 and mutant on EGFR degradation. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of GAPex-5 depletion on EGFR degradation (Fig. 1D), overexpression of GAPex-5 WT substantially enhanced EGFR degradation (Fig. 4, D and E). However, cells overexpressing GAPex-5ΔGAP displayed EGFR degradation kinetics similar to cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4, D and E). Collectively, these results suggest that GAPex-5 mediates EGFR degradation via its interaction with c-Cbl through its RAS GAP domain. EGFR Ubiquitination Is Independent of Rab5 Activation—To examine whether GAPex-5-mediated EGFR ubiquitination depends on its ability to activate Rab5, we examined whether a dominant negative form of Rab5 (Rab5a:S34N) affects EGFR ubiquitination. CHO/hEGFR cells were infected with Sindbis virus encoding Rab5a:S34N or empty virus. Consistent with its inhibitory effects on EGFR internalization, Rab5a:S34N dramatically inhibited the degradation of EGFR (Fig. 5A). After starvation and stimulation with EGF for 5 min, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibody. Immunoblot analysis of the immunocomplexes demonstrated that cells expressing Rab5a:S34N have higher amounts of ubiquitinated EGFR (Fig. 5B). Previous studies suggested that ubiquitinated EGFRs were deubiquitinated by a variety of deubiquitinating enzymes on early endosomes. Our results indicate that the enhanced ubiquitination of EGFR in cells overexpressing Rab5a:S34N may be due to impaired receptor internalization. We further studied whether Rab5 proteins may be required for EGFR ubiquitination. Accordingly, three Rab5 isoforms were depleted in HeLa cells and EGFR internalization was partially inhibited (∼50%, data not shown), which is consistent with previous studies (32Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The cells were starved and stimulated with EGF for 5 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibody and analyzed with immunoblotting. Similar to overexpression of Rab5a:S34N, depletion of all three Rab5 isoforms does not inhibit EGFR ubiquitination (Fig. 5C). Collectively, our results suggest that the effect of GAPex-5 on EGFR ubiquitination is likely independent of Rab5 activity. Several recent studies demonstrated that GAPex-5 is a Rab5 exchange factor that mediates multiple endocytic events (25Su X. Lodhi I.J. Saltiel A.R. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27982-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Lodhi I.J. Chiang S.H. Chang L. Vollenweider D. Watson R.T. Inoue M. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our present study provides multiple clues regarding a novel mechanism underlying GAPex-5-mediated EGFR trafficking and degradation. First, depletion of GAPex-5 delays EGFR degradation, whereas overexpression of GAPex-5 has the opposite effect (Fig. 4B). Second, depletion of GAPex-5 modestly decreases the rate of EGFR internalization. This effect might be Rab5-dependent. Third, down-regulation of GAPex-5 impairs the recruitment of c-Cbl to EGFR and subsequent receptor ubiquitination, which is not due to any impairment of receptor phosphorylation. Fourth, GAPex-5 depletion blocks the trafficking of EGFR into late, but not early, endocytic compartments. This result is consistent with a requirement for ubiquitination in order for EGFR to be recruited into endosomal sorting complexes required for transport and subsequently delivered into the lumen of MVB (12Clague M.J. Urbe S. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Fifth, c-Cbl interacts with GAPex-5 WT, but not GAPex-5ΔGAP. Importantly, EGFR degradation is enhanced by GAPex-5 WT, but not by GAPex-5ΔGAP. Lastly, EGF-stimulated receptor ubiquitination is independent of Rab5 activity. Together, our present study suggests that GAPex-5 affects EGFR degradation via mediating receptor ubiquitination by its RAS GAP domain. Upon EGF stimulation, the phosphorylation of the activated receptor provides binding sites for downstream effectors that activate multiple signaling pathways and mediate receptor trafficking (2Sebastian S. Settleman J. Reshkin S.J. Azzariti A. Bellizzi A. Paradiso A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1766: 120-139PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylated tyrosines are subsequently dephosphorylated to attenuate receptor activity (37Ostman A. Hellberg C. Bohmer F.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that depletion of GAPex-5 delayed the dephosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 2). Given the finding that down-regulation of GAPex-5 also decreased the internalization of EGFR, our results suggest that dephosphorylation of EGFR phosphotyrosine residues mainly occurred after internalization. This is consistent with a previous study (38Haj F.G. Verveer P.J. Squire A. Neel B.G. Bastiaens P.I. Science. 2002; 295: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) that indicated that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B-catalyzed dephosphorylation of EGFR required endocytosis and occurred on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. Of course, further experiments using independent approaches to inhibit EGFR internalization (e.g. depletion of dynamin 2) are required to confirm this supposition. Although depletion of GAPex-5 sustains the phospho-tyrosine of EGFR (both total phosphor-tyrosine and pY1045), it impairs the recruitment of c-Cbl to EGFR and subsequently inhibits receptor ubiquitination. This result strongly indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation is not sufficient to recruit c-Cbl. Interestingly, GAPex-5 binds to c-Cbl independently of EGF stimulation. It seems likely that GAPex-5 and c-Cbl might form a dynamic complex that facilitates recruitment of Cbl to EGFR and receptor ubiquitination. This model is supported by further experiments using a GAPex-5 mutant, GAPex-5ΔGAP. GAPex-5ΔGAP does not bind to c-Cbl and cannot enhance EGFR ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 4). Trafficking of EGFR from plasma membrane to lysosome for degradation may be dissected into multiple steps, including internalization and formation of endocytic vesicles, movement of vesicles on cytoskeletal elements, fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes, and trafficking from early endosomes to late endosomes. Ubiquitination of EGFR occurs on the plasma membrane but is not required for receptor endocytosis (39Huang F. Kirkpatrick D. Jiang X. Gygi S. Sorkin A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 737-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, receptor ubiquitination is critical for trafficking from early endosomes to MVB/late endosomes. In HeLa cells, internalization of EGFR is usually completed within 5-10 min, whereas the half-life of the receptor is ∼30 min (40Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). It seems that the initial step of EGFR internalization may not be the rate-limiting step for receptor degradation. That is, small fluctuations in the rate of EGFR internalization may not affect receptor degradation. Only when EGFR internalization is severely impaired (e.g. by overexpressing Rab5a:S34N, Fig. 5A) will receptor degradation be affected. Thus, the modestly decreased rate of receptor internalization (Fig. 1B) by GAPex-5 depletion may not be a major factor contributing to the impaired EGFR degradation. It seems most likely that depletion of GAPex-5 attenuates EGFR ubiquitination and impairs its trafficking from early endosomes to MVB/late endosomes and that this effect contributes dominantly to delayed receptor degradation. Further experiments using independent approaches to gradually inhibit EGFR internalization by depleting different proteins as described (32Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) will help to confirm the supposition. A recent study demonstrated that GAPex-5 is also an exchange factor for Rab31, a Rab5 subfamily GTPase implicated in trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to endosome (26Lodhi I.J. Chiang S.H. Chang L. Vollenweider D. Watson R.T. Inoue M. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Cell. Metab. 2007; 5: 59-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the absence of insulin, GAPex-5 activates Rab31 and promotes a futile cycle between GLUT4 storage vesicles and early endosomes, thus retaining GLUT4 inside the cells. Upon insulin stimulation, GAPex-5 is recruited to plasma membrane and releases GLUT4 from intracellular storage vesicles. Given that GAPex-5 also mediates the internalization of insulin receptor and EGFR, GAPex-5 appears to have different Rab targets and to regulate distinct cellular functions. It will be of interest to examine whether GAPex-5-mediated Rab31 activation is involved in EGFR trafficking and how activation of Rab5 and Rab31 by GAPex-5 is coordinated. The requirement of Ras GAP domain of GAPex-5 for its interaction with c-Cbl raises the question whether Ras play roles in EGFR degradation. Indeed, previous studies demonstrated that dominant positive H-Ras (G12V) delays EGFR degradation (6Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 41Wu W.J. Tu S. Cerione R.A. Cell. 2003; 114: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, GAPex-5:Ras GAP domain binds to H-Ras:G12V and has GAP activity toward H-Ras in vitro (27Hunker C.M. Galvis A. Kruk I. Giambini H. Veisaga M.L. Barbieri M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The model suggested by the current study indicates that G12V H-Ras might compete with GAPex-5 for binding with c-Cbl and thereby inhibit the recruitment of c-Cbl to EGFR. In summary, the present study demonstrates that GAPex-5 mediates EGFR ubiquitination and degradation via Ras GAP domain. Because Ras mutations significantly contribute to the development of a variety of cancers, our present study suggests that GAPex-5 may be a novel effector for H-Ras and a mediator of carcinogenesis.

Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). RFC is a heteropentameric protein complex composed of a large subunit (RFC1) and four small subunits (RFC2 to -5), all of which belong to the AAA+ ATPase family (2Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L.

Structural and biochemical studies have demonstrated that an ATP-dependent conformational change in RFC promotes loading of PCNA onto template DNA (4Shiomi Y. Usukura J. Masamura Y. Takeyasu K.

Three other clamp loader complexes that are involved in checkpoint responses (Rad17-RFC), sister chromatid cohesion (Ctf18/Chl12-RFC), and maintenance of genome stability (Elg1-RFC) have been identified in eukaryotes (9Kim J. MacNeill S.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 (–R875): R873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Majka J. Burgers P.M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Ctf18/Chl12, hereafter referred to as Ctf18, is required for precise chromosome transmission in yeast and is highly conserved in eukaryotes (11Kouprina N. Tsouladze A. Koryabin M. Hieter P. Spencer F. Larionov V. Yeast. 1993; 9: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Kouprina N. Kroll E. Kirillov A. Bannikov V. Zakharyev V. Larionov V. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1067-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike other loader complexes, Ctf18-RFC also associates with the chromosome cohesion factors Dcc1 and Ctf8 to form a heteroheptameric complex, although functions for the additional subunits have not been identified (13Bermudez V.P.

Kimura, and T. Tsurimoto, unpublished results. ; we refer to the heptameric and pentameric complexes as Ctf18-RFC and Ctf18-RFC(5s), respectively. Ctf18-RFC loads functional PCNA onto the 3′ end of a primer-template DNA duplex, and like RFC, it stimulates pol δ activity in vitro. Nonetheless, the functions of these two PCNA loaders are clearly distinguishable. For example, PCNA loaded by Ctf18-RFC can fully support DNA synthesis by pol δ on a primed M13mp18 single-stranded DNA (M13) DNA template, but Ctf18-RFC cannot substitute for RFC in promoting SV40 DNA replication in vitro with crude human protein fractions (14Shiomi Y. Shinozaki A. Sugimoto K. Usukura J. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Ctf18-RFC functions in the chromosome cohesion pathway by activating specific target proteins, such as DNA polymerases. Indeed, DNA pol σ, ɛ, and α have been implicated in the chromosome cohesion (15Wang Z. Castano I.B. De Las Penas A. Adams C. Christman M.F. Science. 2000; 289: 774-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Edwards S. Li C.M. Levy D.L. Brown J. Snow P.M. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2733-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Zhou Y. Wang T.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 21: 9568-9579Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), although biochemical evidence for these activities has not been reported. Several eukaryotic DNA polymerases have been identified recently. Most belong to the novel DNA polymerase X and Y families, based on conserved motifs distinguishable from those seen in the B family, which include the major replicative DNA polymerases (18Hubscher U. Maga G. Spadari S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Some of these carry out translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), which incorporates nucleotides (nt) at damaged sites with low fidelity. The primary role of these polymerases is to function as a backup system for more conventional DNA repair to avoid unnecessary cell death in the event of severe DNA damage. However, some may have more diverse functions. For example, targeted mutation of a TLS polymerase, pol ζ, which is an exceptional member of the B family, results in embryonic lethality in mice, suggesting that it functions during development (19Bemark M. Khamlichi A.A. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1213-1216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, our knowledge of the functions of these novel DNA polymerases remains limited. PCNA interacts with and stimulates the DNA synthesis activities of many of these polymerases (20Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of their recruitment by PCNA to particular DNA sites and the determinants of selectivity are not known. In this report, we fractionated human cell lysates to isolate DNA synthesis activities, which allowed us to identify pol η as a potential target for the second PCNA loader, Ctf18-RFC. Furthermore, we show that Ctf18-RFC directly interacts with pol η and stimulates its activity, indicating a novel role for the loader complex. These results also demonstrate that pol η, identified as a TLS polymerase, has more diverse functions in regulating replication fork progression. Fractionation of Ctf18-RFC-stimulated DNA Polymerase Activity from Human Cell Lysates—Two representative experiments (experiments 1 and 2) were carried out under essentially the same conditions. Human 293 cell cytoplasmic extracts (S100) were prepared from 24- or 16-liter suspension cultures for experiments 1 and 2, respectively, as described (21Stillman B. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Three fractions eluting at 0.24, 0.35, and 0.68 m NaCl in buffer H (25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) from a phosphocellulose column (P-11; Whatman, Middlesex, UK) were prepared from lysates (22Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against buffer H containing 25 mm NaCl and 20% sucrose, and their DNA synthesis activity was measured. The 0.35 m NaCl fraction was further fractionated by stepwise elution with 0.025, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 m NaCl on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) in buffer H. The eluates were dialyzed against buffer H containing 25 mm NaCl and 20% sucrose, and DNA synthesis activity was measured. The 0.1 m NaCl fraction was then applied to a linear NaCl gradient (0.025–0.6 m) in buffer H on a mini-S column (Amersham Biosciences; PE 4.6/50 for experiment 1 and PC 3.2/3 for experiment 2). Fractions with DNA synthesis activity were pooled and separated further; in experiment 1, the fractions were separated in a 4.4-ml glycerol gradient (15–35%) in buffer H containing 0.1 m NaCl centrifuged at 49,000 rpm for 18 h in a SW55 rotor (Beckman Coulter), and in experiment 2, the fractions were separated in a 2.2-ml gradient centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 14 h in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Experiments 1 and 2 yielded 22 and 18 fractions, respectively, and their respective activity peaks were pooled. LC/MS/MS analyses were performed on the experiment 1 glycerol gradient pool as described (23Ohta S. Shiomi Y. Sugimoto K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol.

This transfer plasmid was constructed with pBacPAK9 (Clontech) by inserting the pol η cDNA immediately after a His tag cassette. Both His-tagged pol η proteins were prepared from insect cells as previously described (28Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F.

The N- and C-terminal His-tagged pol η were used for the pull-down analysis in Fig. 5A and DNA synthesis analyses in Figs. 2C, 3, and 4. The plasmid pETHispolλ for His-tagged pol λ (His-pol λ) expression was constructed by insertion of the pol λ cDNA into pET20b (Novagen (Merck)), which resulted in an N-terminal fusion of the His tag. His-pol λ was prepared from E. coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) carrying pETHispolλ using DEAE-Sepharose, Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose high performance, and fast desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences).FIGURE 2A, top graph, DNA synthesis activity of the mini-S fractions (experiment 2) with RFC, Ctf18-RFC, or neither on singly primed M13 in the presence of PCNA.

Antibodies—Antibodies to the catalytic subunits of human pol δ (C-20, sc-8797; polyclonal) and to RFCp37 (RFC4; H-183, sc-20996; polyclonal) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (F-3165) was from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with pol α (STK1) (29Tanaka S. Hu S.Z. Wang T.S. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8386-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pol ɛ (CRL-2284) were prepared from mouse hybridoma cell lines purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The rabbit anti-Ctf18 serum has been described (14Shiomi Y. Shinozaki A. Sugimoto K. Usukura J. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An anti-human pol η monoclonal antibody, 5H10, prepared with a His-tagged human pol η fragment of amino acid residues 1–511 4C. Masutani and F. Hanaoka, unpublished data. was used for immunoblotting. DNA Synthesis Activity—DNA synthesis with 30 ng of M13 DNA (Takara, Shiga, Japan) annealed with a 20-mer sequencing primer (GTTGTAAAACGACG) was assayed in a reaction mixture (5 μl) containing 30 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 7 mm MgCl2, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm each dNTP with [α-32P]dTTP, 20 ng of PCNA, 100 ng of RPA, and the indicated amounts of protein at 37 °C for 1 h. One-third of the reaction was spotted on DE81 paper (Whatman) to measure incorporated radioactivity (30Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 31Shikata K. Ohta S. Yamada K. Obuse C. Yoshikawa H. Tsurimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis products were taken from the same reactions using a 32P-labeled 20-mer primer and the indicated amounts of pol η at various NaCl concentrations. After the reaction, the products were denatured with formamide and loaded onto 13.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, radioactivity was measured with a Fuji Image analyzer LAS5000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To measure the processivity of DNA synthesis, a 32P-labeled singly primed M13 DNA substrate was preincubated with pol η (0.1 μg/ml) without dNTP at 90 mm NaCl for 10 min at 37 °C. After preincubation, activated calf thymus DNA (Amersham Biosciences) at final concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml was added to the mixture as a DNA trap, along with a 0.25 mm concentration of each dNTP. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped, and the products were electrophoresed in a 19% polyacrylamide gel. DNA synthesis with poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (20:1; 6 μm nt) was assayed in a reaction mixture (5 μl) containing 30 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 7 mm MgCl2, 90 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 mm [α-32P]dTTP, 100 ng of RPA, and 45 ng of loader complexes, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Experiments were performed with or without 20 ng of PCNA or 1 mm ATP. Interaction of Clamp Loaders and Pol η—About 100 ng of FLAG-tagged RFC or Ctf18-RFC produced by baculovirus systems was prebound with 3 μl of anti-FLAG beads (anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity beads; Sigma) at 0 °C for 1 h. After four washes with 50 μl of buffer H containing 0.5 m NaCl, the beads were mixed with 60, 120, or 250 ng of purified N-terminal Hispol η in 10 μl of buffer H with 0.15 m NaCl at 0 °C for 1 h and then washed four times with 30 μl of the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 20 μl of SDS loading buffer. Six μl of each of the eluates was separated in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG, anti-p37, or anti-pol η antibodies, and quantified using Fuji Image Gauge software (Fujifilm). Expression of FLAG-Ctf18 and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-Pol η in Human 293 Cells and Co-immunoprecipitation—Ctf18 or pol η with N-terminal FLAG or GFP tags was constructed by inserting these cDNAs into pcDNA3 or pEGFP-C1 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids, pcDNA-FLAG-Ctf18 and pEGFP-polη, were transfected into 293 cells (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). After incubation at 37 °C for 72 h, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with 0.1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and again washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times. The cells were then suspended in 250 μl of modified CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 300 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and centrifuged for 5 min at 700 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was obtained as the lysate. GFP-tagged pol η in 25 μl of lysate was bound with 1 μl of agarose beads conjugated to anti-GFP antibodies (MBL, Aichi, Japan) at 0 °C for 1 h. After four washes with modified CSK buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 10 μl of SDS loading buffer, separated in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, immunoblotted with anti-FLAG or anti-pol η antibodies, and quantified using Fuji Image Gauge software. Identification of a DNA Polymerase Activity Stimulated by Ctf18-RFC and PCNA—To identify target DNA polymerases for Ctf18-RFC and PCNA, we analyzed crude fractions of human 293 cell extracts for DNA synthesis activity that was specifically stimulated by these proteins. We isolated a DNA polymerase-enriched fraction (the 0.35 m fraction) eluting between 0.24 and 0.35 m NaCl from a phosphocellulose column (22Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis activity was measured in the presence of singly primed M13 DNA, RPA, PCNA, and RFC or Ctf18-RFC (Fig. 1A) under assay conditions in which an equivalent stimulation of purified pol δ-dependent DNA synthesis could be observed with RFC or Ctf18-RFC, as previously described (Fig. 1B, c) (14Shiomi Y. Shinozaki A. Sugimoto K. Usukura J. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Stimulation was not observed with Ctf18-RFC, whereas the addition of RFC increased activity about 6-fold compared with that from reactions lacking loader complexes (Fig. 1A; 0.35 m) (14Shiomi Y. Shinozaki A. Sugimoto K. Usukura J. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We further fractionated the 0.35 m fraction on a Q-Sepharose column by stepwise elution with 0.025, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 m NaCl and measured DNA polymerase activities (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A) as well as the levels of the catalytic subunits of pol α, δ, and ɛ by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C, top). The 0.025 m NaCl fraction did not contain detectable DNA polymerase activity or pol α, δ, or ɛ subunits (Fig. 1, B (a) and C (lane 2)). Instead, DNA polymerase activities and various levels of pol α, δ, and ɛ were seen in the 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 m NaCl fractions (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6, and supplemental Fig. S1A). However, polymerase activities in these fractions were not specifically stimulated by Ctf18-RFC. In contrast, although the 0.1 m fraction did not contain detectable pol α, δ, or ɛ (Fig. 1C, lane 3), the low DNA polymerase activity in this fraction appeared to be specifically stimulated by Ctf18-RFC (Fig. 1B, b). The Q-Sepharose 0.1 m NaCl fraction was further fractionated on a mini-S column with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.025 to 0.6 m. DNA polymerase activity specifically stimulated by Ctf18-RFC formed minor peaks at the 0.25 and 0.35 m fractions and a major peak at the 0.45 m NaCl fraction (Fig. 2A, graph). We further processed the 0.45 m fraction by glycerol gradient sedimentation and observed a single DNA polymerase activity peak in a fraction around 60 kDa (Fig. 2B, graph). Titration of this peak fraction demonstrated that DNA polymerase activity was specifically and strongly stimulated by Ctf18-RFC and PCNA (Fig. 2C (a) and supplemental Fig. S1B). The Polymerase Stimulated by Ctf18-RFC and PCNA Is Pol η—Staining of proteins in the glycerol gradient fractions revealed that they contained too many protein bands to allow a single band co-eluting with the activity to be distinguished. Therefore, we identified all proteins in the pooled peak fractions by LC/MS/MS analysis. The glycerol gradient was divided into 38 gel slices, and the proteins in each slice were identified following in-gel trypsin digestion (Fig. 2D). The raw data were used to query the MASCOT protein data base, which identified various human proteins with high scores (data not shown). Among these, pol η and pol λ were prominent as DNA polymerases with highly significant scores. The graphs in Fig. 2D indicate the numbers of peptides identified as pol η and λ in each gel slice, which represents the approximate abundance of each protein. Peaks corresponding to pol η and λ appeared around 75 and 65 kDa, which roughly correspond to their predicted peptide lengths, respectively. To determine which polymerase was responsible for activity, we prepared recombinant human pol η and λ. Because the DNA synthesis activity of recombinant pol η with poly(dA)/oligo(dT) was 20 times higher than that of recombinant pol λ (supplemental Fig. S2A), we evaluated the activities of both polymerases in the presence of Ctf18-RFC and PCNA by using 20-fold more pol λ than pol η. As shown in Fig. 2C (b), pol η activity with singly primed M13 DNA was efficiently stimulated by Ctf18-RFC but only slightly by RFC, similar to what was seen for the most purified polymerase fraction (Fig. 2C, a). In contrast, pol λ exhibited much lower DNA synthesis activity and was not obviously stimulated by either Ctf18-RFC or RFC (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, the protein we purified exhibited DNA polymerase activity equivalent to that of pol η. Co-purification of Pol η with the DNA Polymerase Activity Stimulated by Ctf18-RFC and PCNA—We asked whether pol η co-purified with polymerase activity during purification. We detected a band of ∼75 kDa in the 0.35 m fraction of the phosphocellulose column by immunoblotting with an anti-pol η antibody (Fig. 1C, bottom). Protein bands around 50 kDa co-purified with pol η in subsequent steps. Since the abundance of these bands relative to that of the 75-kDa protein differed from"
https://openalex.org/W1591236513,"Growing evidence suggests that overexpression of TrkC, a member of the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors, could drive tumorigenesis, invasion and metastatic capability in cancer cells. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of TrkC-mediated oncogenesis. The TrkC gene is a partner of the Tel-TrkC (ETV6-NTRK3) chimeric tyrosine kinase, a potent oncoprotein expressed in tumors derived from multiple cell lineages. Recently, we have shown that ETV6-NTRK3 suppresses transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling by directly binding to the type II TGF-β receptor (TβRII). Here, we report that expression of TrkC also suppresses TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation. Silencing TrkC expression by small interfering RNA in the highly metastatic 4T1 mammary tumor cell line expressing endogenous TrkC significantly enhanced TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and restored TGF-β growth inhibitory activity. In contrast, expression of TrkC in 67NR cells, in which TrkC is not expressed, suppressed TGF-β transcriptional activation. Moreover, we show that TrkC directly binds to the TβRII, thereby preventing it from interacting with the type I TGF-β receptor (TβRI). These results indicate that TrkC is an inhibitor of TGF-β tumor suppressor activity."

Biochem. Parasitol. 138, 83–87) based on epitope-specific monoclonal antibodies suggesting that this region undergoes a conformational change upon infection. The biotinylation of proteins is a commonly used tool for the affinity purification of proteins (1Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 14-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It takes advantage of the highly specific interaction between biotin and avidin or its bacterial homolog, streptavidin. Protein biotinylation utilizes biotin derivatives containing an active ester group that reacts with primary amines of proteins, particularly with the N terminus and the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues. A novel amide bond is thereby formed, and the biotin moiety is covalently attached to the respective amino group, often separated by a spacer of defined size. The biotin derivative sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin) 3The abbreviations used are: sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate; iRBC, infected red blood cells; RBC, non-infected red blood cells; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MS, mass spectrometry; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. is a hydrophilic reagent that is excluded from most cells and is therefore used for the biotinylation and subsequent affinity purification of cellsurface proteins. Recently, we used sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to label proteins exposed on the surface of human red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (iRBC) (2Nyalwidhe J. Baumeister S.

Uptake of the compound occurs through the socalled novel permeability pathways, which are parasite-induced and have a broad specificity with a preference for anions (3Kirk K. Physiol.

Biotinylation of internal proteins can be minimized if the reaction occurs in the presence of novel permeability pathway inhibitors such as furosemide. The proteins that constitute the novel permeability pathway are still unknown. The band 3 anion exchanger AE1 is the most abundant anion transporter in RBC (7Frazar T.F. Weisbein J.L. Anderson S.M. Cline A.P. Garrett L.J. Felsenfeld G. Gallagher P.G. Bodine D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4753-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reactivity of an epitope-specific monoclonal antibody with band 3, which differs between infected and noninfected erythrocytes, has been interpreted as a conformational change in the protein in at least one of the extracellular domains (8Winograd E. Sherman I.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although band 3 itself does not appear to be the actual channel protein mediating the novel permeability pathway (5Baumeister S. Winterberg M. Duranton C. Huber S.M. Lang F. Kirk K. Lingelbach K. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 493-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), its conformational change as a consequence of the infection may nevertheless play an important role in the survival of the parasite within its host cell. Therefore, we sought an experimental strategy to more precisely define the position within the band 3 molecule where this conformational change could possibly occur. In a recent proteome analysis, we used in situ biotinylation of permeabilized iRBC to specifically label soluble parasite proteins contained in the parasitophorous vacuole (9Nyalwidhe J. Lingelbach K. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 1563-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Peptide mass fingerprinting of 27 different biotinylated proteins revealed a high reproducibility of the biotinylation patterns of individual proteins in different experiments. These observations prompted us to investigate whether changes in protein conformation are reflected by changes in biotinylation patterns and whether this mapping can be exploited as an experimental strategy to detect conformational changes in cell-surface proteins. Although amino acid residue modifications by specific tags and cross-linkers in combination with mass spectrometry have been used as tools for probing the tertiary structure of proteins (10Bennett K.L.

As a case study, we have used bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a soluble model protein to show that specific, experimentally induced, conformational changes result in a highly reproducible biotinylation pattern of lysine residues. Using this method, a comparison of the biotinylation patterns of band 3 allowed us to identify a distinct difference between iRBC and RBC.

For analysis of the biotinylation pattern of BSA, 1 ml of the solution (containing 1.4 × 10–4 mol of BSA) was biotinylated with 1-, 10-, 20-, 40-, and 60-fold molar eq (taking into account 60 lysine residues/BSA molecule) of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 100 mm. The unreacted biotin derivative was removed from the sample by centrifugation at 3000 × g using a Millipore microconcentrator with a size exclusion of 5 kDa. This step was repeated twice after dilution with PBS before determining the protein concentration using the BCA assay (Pierce). For bovine carbonic anhydrase, 1.2 × 10–4 mol of carbonic anhydrase were biotinylated using a 40-fold molar excess of biotin derivative and processed as described for BSA. For analysis of the artificially induced conformational changes, BSA and carbonic anhydrase were dissolved in PBS as described above and subjected to an elevated temperature of either 56 or 80 °C for 30 min before cooling to room temperature and biotinylation with a 40-fold molar excess of biotin derivative. For affinity purification of the biotinylated proteins, 72 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce) were washed extensively with PBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 before mixing the beads with 100 μg (1.44 × 10–6 mol) of biotinylated proteins. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the unbound non-biotinylated protein fraction was obtained as a supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The beads containing bound biotinylated protein were washed consecutively in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl; in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and 500 mm NaCl; and finally in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The bound protein fraction was eluted from the beads by boiling in 500 μl of denaturing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Biotinylation of Erythrocyte Membrane Proteins—RBC were obtained from blood group A+ donors and infected with the human malaria parasite P. falciparum using standard conditions. RBC and iRBC were cultured separately in RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 10% human plasma under standard conditions (13Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Erythrocytes infected with mature stage parasites were isolated from culture by plasmagel flotation, resulting in >90% iRBC (14Pasvol G. Wilson R.J. Smalley M.E. Brown J. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of intact erythrocytes (either infected or non-infected) was performed as described (4Baumeister S. Endermann T. Charpian S. Nyalwidhe J. Duranton C. Huber S. Kirk K. Lang F. Lingelbach K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 132: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 108 RBC or iRBC were washed with PBS (pH 7.6), incubated in the same buffer containing different concentrations of the biotin derivative (2, 1, and 0.5 mg/ml) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 100 μm furosemide, and subsequently sedimented at 1300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. To block and remove unreacted biotin derivative molecules, cells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.6) containing 100 mm glycine and then with PBS. To enrich for membrane proteins, cells were resuspended in distilled water supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture containing antipain, chymostatin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, Na-EDTA, pepstatin, leupeptin, and elastatinal (each at a concentration of 1 μg/ml) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The membrane fraction was sedimented by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using standard procedures. To detect biotin-labeled proteins, the membranes were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature before incubation for 20 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (1:10,000/3% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4); Pharmingen). The membranes were washed three times with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl, and the biotin-labeled proteins were visualized after staining with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry (MS)—Protein bands were excised from polyacrylamide gels and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion before MS analysis (15Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Briefly, the excised spots were washed with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile in 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and the destained protein was in gel-reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 56°Cand alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide in the same buffer for 45 min at room temperature in darkness. The gel pieces were washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated in acetonitrile, and dried. The gels were re-swollen in 15 μl of 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 20 μg/ml sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega Corp.) for 45 min at 4 °C. Excess protease-containing solution was discarded, and 5 μl of 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate were added to keep the gel pieces wet during the 18-h proteolytic cleavage step at 37 °C. To extract the peptides, 15 μl of diffusion solution (10% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid) were added, and the samples were sonicated for 45 min at 37 °C. The soluble portion of the sample was evaporated to dryness. For MS measurements, the samples were redissolved in 15 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and 5% (v/v) acetonitrile in water. The peptides were purified and concentrated using ZipTip™ columns made from the reverse chromatography resins POROS R2 and Oligo R3 (Applied Biosystems). The bound peptides were washed with a solution of 0.5% formic acid and eluted from the ZipTip™ columns with 2 μl of 33% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid directly onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) sample plate and air-dried before analysis in the mass spectrometer. Alternatively, for affinity enrichment of biotinylated tryptic peptides, SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized by Ponceau staining. The stained membranes were cut into 2 × 2-mm square pieces, thoroughly destained with water, treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 1 h at 56 °C,and alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide in the same buffer for 45 min at room temperature in darkness. The nitrocellulose pieces were washed with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and dried. The membranes were incubated in a minimal volume of 40 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 20 μg/ml sequencinggrade trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the membrane pieces twice using 20% acetonitrile in 1% trifluoroacetic acid, with sonication at 37 °C for 45 min. The eluted peptides were resuspended in 500 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated overnight with 72 μl of washed streptavidin-Sepharose beads to affinity purify the biotinylated peptides. The unbound non-biotinylated peptide fraction was obtained as a supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. This fraction was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before processing for MS. The Sepharose beads containing bound biotinylated peptides were washed three times with 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 1% octyl glucoside. The bound peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid, and 1 mmd-biotin in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 2 h. The solution was evaporated to dryness and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid before processing for MS. MS Analysis—MS was performed using a Bruker Daltonics Ultraflex™ mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm laser, 3-ns pulse width, and 50-Hz repetition rate) and panoramic mass range focusing (PAN™) technology and high precision calibration (HPC™) for high mass accuracy. For analysis of intact protein, mass spectra were acquired after an external calibration using the reference protein standards trypsinogen, protein A, bovine albumin, protein A2+, and bovine albumin2+ (protein calibration standard II, Bruker Daltonics). Mass spectra were acquired in the linear positive mode with a pulsed extraction using ∼100 laser shots, and the masses were assigned and processed using BioTools™ and flexAnalysis™ software (Bruker Daltonics). For the trypsin digests, peptide mass fingerprint spectra were acquired in the reflectron positive mode with a pulsed extraction using an average of 100 laser shots. The spectra were acquired after an external calibration using reference peptides (peptide mixture II, Bruker Daltonics). The spectra were further internally calibrated using trypsin autolysis peaks (842.5100 and 2211.1046 Da). Monoisotopic masses were assigned and processed using BioTools™ and flexAnalysis™ software before submission to the Mascot program (www.matrixscience.com) for searches against the nonredundant NCBI Database. The following variable modifications were used in the searches: methionine oxidation, lysine sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin-labeled, pyroglutamic acid from Glu at the N terminus, pyroglutamic acid from Gln, and a fixed cysteine carbamidomethylation modification. To analyze the effect of missed proteolytic cleavage of peptides on the identification of the proteins and biotinylated lysine residues, the searches were done allowing complete cleavage (0 missed cleavage sites) and allowing one or two missed cleavage sites. A mass accuracy of 50 ppm or better was used in all identifications. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis was done using the LIFT™ mode to provide i, a, b, and y ions. The masses of the fragmented ions were submitted to the Mascot program for data base searching using the following parameters: peptide mass tolerance of 100 ppm, MS/MS tolerance of 0.7 Da, and two missed cleavage sites. The variable and fixed modifications of amino acid residues were used as described for the peptide mass fingerprint analyses. To analyze the spatial distribution of lysine residues across the structures of BSA and carbonic anhydrase II, the crystal structure of the latter enzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1V9E) was examined. As no crystal structure of BSA has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, a homology model was obtained from the SWISS-MODEL Repository (17Kopp J. Schwede T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D230-D234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of human serum albumin as a template (Protein Data Bank code 1N5U). To detect possible correlations between the degree of biotinylation, the local environment of lysine residues, and the solvent-accessible surface (18Ahmad S. Gromiha M. Fawareh H. Sarai A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 51Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), their involvement in hydrogen bonding, the hydrogen bond energy, and the local electrostatic potential were studied. The latter was computed and visualized using the MOLCAD module of SYBYL 7.1 (19Tripos Inc. SYBYL Molecular Modeling Package. Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO2005Google Scholar); hydrogen bond energies were calculated using the MAB force field implemented in MOLOC (20Gerber P.R. Muller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of BSA Is Saturable but Incomplete—Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin derivatives possess an active ester group that reacts with the primary amines of proteins and/or the ϵ-amino group of lysine residues, thereby forming an amide bond (Fig. 1). For each lysine residue, this reaction results in an increase in mass of 339.161 Da. If all 60 lysine residues of the BSA molecule were biotinylated, the calculated mass shift of the protein would be 20.34 kDa. BSA was biotinylated with increasing molar ratios of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to protein and analyzed by time-of-flight MS in linear mode. The mass of the protein increased in an almost linear correlation with the molar excess of the biotin derivative, up to a 40-fold molar excess of the derivative (Table 1). The maximal increase we observed was 6.1 kDa, accounting for ∼18 biotinylated lysine residues. Thus, the biotinylation of lysine residues in the BSA molecule is incomplete. Analysis of the biotinylated protein by SDS-PAGE confirmed the increase in molecular mass of Coomassie Blue-stained protein, which was verified by biotin detection with streptavidin (supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 1Effect of an increase in the molar ratio of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to BSA on the mass of BSASulfo-LC-biotin/BSA molar ratioMass of BSA by MSApproximate no. of incorporated biotin residuesaEach modified lysine residue resulted in an increase in mass of ∼339 Da.Da066,525.3None166,598.0ND1068,269.052069,853.9104072,271.4176072,599.518a Each modified lysine residue resulted in an increase in mass of ∼339 Da. Open table in a new tab To investigate whether biotinylation occurs randomly or whether specific lysine residues are preferentially labeled, biotinylated BSA was analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting. Trypsin, the most commonly used protease to generate peptides for peptide mass fingerprinting, cleaves peptides at the C termini of the basic amino acid residues arginine and lysine. Because biotinylation occurs at the protonated ϵ-amino group of the lysine residue, the modification is likely to affect tryptic cleavage, leading to the generation of peptides containing a missed cleavage site. To analyze biotinylated peptides, BSA was first transferred to nitrocellulose filters and trypsinized. Subsequently, the peptides were affinity-purified and subjected to MS using the reflectron mode. Data base searches assuming complete cleavage were unable to identify BSA-derived peptides, indicating that the peptides contained cleavage sites that were not recognized by the protease. Allowing for one or two missed cleavage sites led to an increased number of identifiable peptides, with only one additional peptide having two missed cleavage sites (supplemental Fig. 2). In the subsequent bioinformatics analyses, we therefore allowed for two missed cleavage sites. BSA biotinylated with different molar ratios of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was excised from polyacrylamide gels, cleaved with trypsin, and subjected to MS in the reflectron mode. Together, the peptides identified contained 34 of the total 60 lysine residues and covered 56% of the BSA sequence. This coverage was the same as obtained for non-biotinylated BSA (data not shown). With increasing concentrations of the biotin derivative in the biotinylation reaction, the numbers of biotinylated peptides increased. Each of these peptides was then analyzed by MS/MS, allowing the identification of individual biotinylated lysine residues. The samples treated with higher concentrations of the biotin derivative contained more biotinylated residues. As in the analysis of the intact protein, the correlation between the numbers of biotinylated lysines and biotin concentration was almost linear (Table 2). The numbers of the modified lysine residues identified by MS/MS correlated with the predicted numbers after MS of the intact protein in the linear mode (Table 1). More important, when biotin concentrations below the point of maximal incorporation were used, labeling of lysine residues did not occur randomly, but at specific sites. Residues that were biotinylated with lower concentrations of the derivative were also labeled when higher concentrations were used. These observations indicate a concentration-dependent, preferential accessibility of individual residues.TABLE 2Biotinylation of individual lysine residues follows a concentration-dependent specific orderSulfo-NHS-LC-biotin/BSA molar ratioHydrogen bond formationϕ110204060Lys36+++Lys100+++Lys156+++Lys160++++Lys204+++Lys211++++Lys228+++Lys235+++++Lys245+++Lys266++Lys374+++Lys401++++Lys412++Lys420++Lys455++++++Lys463++Lys498++Lys559++Total024818186 Open table in a new tab Recently, Huang et al. (21Huang B.X. Kim H.Y. Dass C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) used hydrophilic and hydrophobic cross-linkers and subsequent MS to probe the tertiary structure of BSA. One of the cross-linkers was bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate, which has a reaction mechanism similar to that of sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. They identified a total of 20 modified lysine residues, 13 of which were also labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin in our experiments. Three of the modified residues (Lys138, Lys140, and Lys495) identified in the previous study were detected in all of our experiments, although they were non-biotinylated. One residue (Lys88) was not detected at all in our experiments, and one residue (Lys399) was detected only once in its biotinylated form. Two residues (Lys437 and Lys523) were also biotinylated in our study, but only after exposure of BSA to high temperature (see below). We also identified five additional lysine residues (Lys36, Lys100, Lys266, Lys498, and Lys559) that had not been detected by Huang et al. (21Huang B.X. Kim H.Y. Dass C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 15: 1237-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and it is therefore not possible to directly compare the labeling status in the two experiments. In conclusion, different ionization conditions (electrospray versus MALDI) revealed almost identical peptides, and despite the use of different modifying reagents (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate versus sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin), the majority of the modified residues were identical in both studies, underscoring the reproducibility of the biotinylation reaction described above. In light of a recent report (22Gao J.-P. Zhang F. Zhang L. Guo Y.L. Ruan K.-C. Jiang D. Xu C.-H. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2006; 38: 611-619Crossref Google Scholar) that lysine modification by N-succinimidyl propionate lacking the biotin moiety may induce conformational changes in a low molecular mass protein that is detectable by CD measurements, we investigated the possibility that the reaction between sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and the lysine residues induces structural changes in the BSA molecule. CD spectroscopy was used to monitor changes in the structures of untreated BSA and BSA reacted with increasing molar ratios of the biotin derivative as described above. Far-UV (180–300 nm) measurements were performed at room temperature with a Jasco 810 spectrometer using 50 mm BSA in HEPES. The observed protein CD spectrum is an average of CD signals from all structures and reflects the geometric variability in the secondary structure. There was no significant difference in the spectra of untreated BSA and BSA reacted with the biotin derivative at different molar ratios (data not shown). In all the cases, the BSA structure is predominantly composed of α-helices, and the biotinylation reaction did not induce structural changes that were detectable by CD. In comparison with the protein of the light-harvesting complex that has been analyzed in a previous study (22Gao J.-P. Zhang F. Zhang L. Guo Y.L. Ruan K.-C. Jiang D. Xu C.-H. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2006; 38: 611-619Crossref Google Scholar) and that has a maximum of two disulfide bonds, the BSA molecule forms 17 intramolecular disulfide bonds (23Carter D.C. Ho J.X. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 153-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3043) Google Scholar). We anticipate that the structural compactness of BSA is the reason why this protein does not undergo a conformational change upon biotinylation. To obtain some structural insight into the accessibility of the lysine residues of BSA, a homology model of BSA (NCBI accession number P02769) based on the crystal structure of human serum albumin as a template was consulted (sequence identity of 76%). All lysine residues of BSA were examined with respect to a possible correlation with the following structural descriptors: (i) spatial accessibility (visual inspection and calculation of the solvent-accessible surface), (ii) involvement in a hydrogen bond along with the associated energy of these hydrogen bonds, and (iii) electrostatic potential in the close environment of the considered residues. For descriptors i and iii, no clearly evident correlation could be discovered, whereas the involvement of a lysine residue in a hydrogen bond seems to significantly decrease the probability of biotinylation (supplemental Table 1). For BSA, only 7 of 24 lysine residues involved in a hydrogen bond reacted"

Although Tribbles are highly conserved throughout evolution, the physiological functions of mammalian Tribbles family remain largely unclear. Here we report that human TRB2 is a pro-apoptotic molecule that induces apoptosis of cells mainly of the hematopoietic origin. TRB2 mRNA is selectively induced by removal of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-2 from human erythroleukemia-derived TF-1 cell line or activated primary CD4+ T cells, respectively. It is, however, not induced by many other treatments that trigger apoptosis of these two cell types. Overexpression of TRB2 activates many apoptotic events observed in GM-CSF-deprived TF-1 cells, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Mcl-1 cleavage/degradation, and activation of Bax and a number of caspases. Specific knockdown of TRB2 significantly suppresses GM-CSF deprivation-induced apoptosis and all apoptotic events mentioned above. Finally, we demonstrate that TRB2-induced cleavage and degradation of Mcl-1 are mediated via a caspase-dependent but proteasome-independent mechanism, and overexpression of Mcl-1 or its upstream activator Akt can markedly overcome the apoptogenic effect of TRB2. Altogether, these results suggest that the TRB2-Mcl-1 axis plays an important role in survival factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis of TF-1 cells.

The protein sequence of Tribbles suggests that it is a member of the protein kinase superfamily, but its sequence diverges from the conventional kinase consensus in subdomains I and II, which are essential for ATP binding (6Kostich M. English J. Madison V. Gheyas F. Wang L. Qiu P. Greene J. Laz T.M. Genome Biol. 2002; 3RESEARCH0043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian orthologs of Tribbles, TRB1, TRB2, and TRB3, all appear to contain the consensus serine/threonine kinase catalytic core, but lack a conserved ATP-binding pocket. Accordingly, no kinase activity has been demonstrated for these proteins by in vitro kinase assay (1Grosshans J. Wieschaus E.

Recent studies on mammalian Tribbles proteins have revealed that they may play some important roles in metabolism and growth regulation. In 293 cells, TRB3 is induced by NF-κB and functions to negatively regulate NF-κB-dependent transcription (8Wu M. Xu L.G. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. J. Biol.

During endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis, human TRB3 expression was up-regulated, and knockdown expression of TRB3 by RNA interference rescued cell viability (11Ohoka N. Yoshii S. Hattori T. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Conversely, whereas TRB3 mRNA was induced by nutrient starvation, overexpression of TRB3 prevented nutrient starvation-induced cell death (12Schwarzer R. Dames S. Tondera D. Klippel A. Kaufmann J. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). trb2 is recently reported to be an oncogene, which induces acute myelocytic leukemia in the chimeric mice bearing TRB2-transduced bone marrow, a result likely because of conversion of C/EBPα p42 to C/EBPα p30 in TRB2-transduced cells (13Keeshan K.

In the absence of a specific cytokine, cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells actively undergo apoptosis, which can be blocked by treatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, implying a requirement for de novo RNA/protein synthesis in this apoptotic pathway (14Ishida Y.

Hematol. 1995; 23: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). Several genes have been reported to be induced in mRNA levels following cytokine deprivation and may play some important roles in the cell-death pathway. For example, hrk, the BH3-only Bcl-2 family gene, is up-regulated during interleukin 3 (IL-3) deprivation of hematopoietic progenitors and is involved in the regulation of apoptosis (16Sanz C. Benito A. Inohara N. Ekhterae D. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 2742-2747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 24p3, which encodes a secreted lipocalin, is induced by IL-3 deprivation in several IL-3-dependent cell lines and primary bone marrow cells and is able to induce apoptosis of a variety of leukocytes through an autocrine mechanism (17Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science. 2001; 293: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). RC3, a calcium/calmodulin-binding protein, is induced by IL-2 deprivation in several IL-2-dependent cell lines and activated T cells, which is part of the apoptosis pathway (18Devireddy L.R.

We also launched a gene expedition study by transcription profiling of a human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent cell line TF-1 cultured in the absence of GM-CSF. Here we report the identification of TRB2 as an important modulator of apoptosis in TF-1 cells. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—TF-1 is a cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell line whose normal growth in vitro requires culture medium supplemented with human GM-CSF or IL-3. TF1-bcl-2 is a TF-1 derivative ectopically overexpressing Bcl-2 (19Huang H.M. Li J.C. Hsieh Y.C. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ba/F3, 32D, and FDCP-1 are all murine IL3-dependent cell lines. Cytokine-independent suspension cell lines (Jurkat, WEHI-3, U937, and K562) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol. All cytokine-dependent suspension cell lines were cultured in the same medium but supplemented with specific survival cytokines. Adherent cell lines (HeLa, 293, H1299, and HepG2) and MEL were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Chemicals—Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and digitonin were purchased from Sigma. Z-VAD-fmk was purchased from Bachem. TNF-α, actinomycin D, camptothecin, cycloheximide, dexamethasone, etoposide, and staurosporine were all purchased from BioVision. Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) and MG132 were purchased from Pierce and Calbiochem, respectively. Cytokine Deprivation and Re-stimulation—For cytokine depletion experiments, factor-dependent cells were grown to a saturation density, washed three times in medium without cytokine, and seeded in cytokine-free medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum for the indicated length of time. For cytokine re-stimulation experiments, GM-CSF was added to the starved TF-1 cells to a concentration of 20 ng/ml. Isolation and Activation of Mouse Primary CD4+ T Cells—Splenic CD4+ T cells were isolated by incubating splenocytes with anti-CD4 (L3T4) microbeads followed by purification with an LS-positive selection column and a MACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified CD4+ cells were activated in plates coated with anti-CD3 (2C11, 5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 antibody (37.51, 2.5 μg/ml) for 3 days and then transferred to plates without antibody coating for further cultivation in the presence or absence of IL-2. Expression Vectors—pTRB2-IRES-EGFP was generated by subcloning mouse trb2 cDNA into the BamHI site of the pIRES2-EGFP vector (Clontech). For construction of pEGFP-TRB2 (T2E), the coding region of human TRB2 cDNA without a stop codon was ligated into the BamHI sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). To construct expression plasmids encoding the TRB2-EGFP mutants, standard PCR-assisted mutagenesis-coupled cloning methods were carried out using primer 5′-GCAAGGTGTTTGATATCAGC-3′ in combination with the following primers (underlined nucleotides differ from the wild-type sequence): TRB2-K177A, 5′-CTACTTTTTCCGCAGCGCGAGGTCCCGCAGCA-3′, and TRB2-K177R, 5′-CTACTTTTTCCGCAGCCTGAGGTCCCGCAGCA-3′. These PCR products and a third primer 5′-AGCTGGGTTCAATGTCATGG-3′ were used in a second PCR using pEGFP-TRB2 as template. The resultant PCR products were restricted with EcoRV and BstXI before they were used to replace the corresponding fragment of the pEGFP-TRB2. All mutated nucleotides were confirmed by sequencing. Expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged mouse mcl-1 (20Liu H. Peng H.W. Cheng Y.S. Yuan H.S. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and HA-tagged myr-Akt were as described previously (21Wang J.M. Chao J.R. Chen W. Kuo M.L. Yen J.J. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6195-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gene Transfer—Gene transfers into hematopoietic cells were carried out by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Genepulser set at 180 V and 975 μF (for TF-1 and TF-1-bcl-2 cells) or at 200 V and 975 μF (for other hematopoietic cells) or as otherwise indicated. Transfections of adhesion cells were performed by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Northern and Western Blot Analyses—For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) and analyzed by the standard protocol using cDNA probes specific to TRB1, TRB2, TRB3, and G3PDH. For Western blot analysis, cells to be analyzed were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (7Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), and 100 μg of cell lysates, unless otherwise indicated, were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies as indicated in each figure. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing TRB2 was generated by immunizing rabbits with bacterially produced recombinant TRB2 protein by a standard protocol, and was affinity-purified using specific antigen cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The specificity of this antibody was reconfirmed by Western blot analysis with or without TRB2 antigen competition (data not shown). This antibody can recognize both human and murine TRB2. Other antibodies used in this study include those specific to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax, GFP, human Mcl-1, cytochrome c, p38 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), activated Bax (Clontech), caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (all from Cell Signaling Technologies, Boston), hemagglutinin (HA) tag (Roche Diagnostics), and actin (Sigma). Antibody specific to mouse mcl-1 (20Liu H. Peng H.W. Cheng Y.S. Yuan H.S. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3117-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or mitochondrial import receptor Tom70 was as described previously (22Chou C.H. Lee R.S. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 3952-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Antibody specific to p53 was a gift from Sheau-Yann Shieh, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. Annexin V and TUNEL Staining and Caspase Activity Assays—To analyze cells that have undergone apoptosis, annexin V staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were carried out using the annexin V-cy3 apoptosis detection kit (BioVision, CA) and the in situ cell death detection kit (TMR red, Roche Diagnostics), respectively. In some cases, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize nuclei and examined by confocal microscopy. The activated caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were evaluated with the CaspGLOW™ Red Active caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 staining kits (BioVision, CA) by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis was performed with a BD FACSCalibur system. Cytochrome c Release and Detection of Oligomerized Bax—Staining of cytochrome c was carried out essentially as described by Willis et al. (23Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1294-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In some cases, cells to be analyzed were fractionated into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (24Everett H. Barry M. Lee S.F. Sun X. Graham K. Stone J. Bleackley R.C. McFadden G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and cytochrome c partitioned in these two fractions was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-cytochrome c antibody. To detect oligomerized Bax, cells to be analyzed were cross-linked with disuccinimidyl suberate essentially as described by Sundararajan and White (25Sundararajan R. White E. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7506-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Following cross-linking, cells were lysed and cell lysates analyzed by Western blotting using Bax-specific antibody. RNA Interference—Double-stranded RNA duplex corresponding to human TRB2 (5′-gctggaaagcctggaagac-3′) and nontargeting (nontargeting number 1, D-001210-01-20) siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Chicago). Cells to be analyzed (5 × 106) were mixed with 1 nmol of siRNA in 0.4 ml of Optimal MEM and subjected to electroporation at 250 V, 400 μF with Bio-Rad GenePulser apparatus. TRB2 Is an Immediate Early Gene Induced by GM-CSF Deprivation—In the TF-1 cell line, deprivation of human GM-CSF induces profound apoptosis within 24 h. This apoptotic process can be suppressed significantly by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that de novo gene expression is required to mediate this death program. To identify genes whose expression is up-regulated after cytokine deprivation, we studied the expression profiles of 8000 genes using a cDNA microarray (Taiwan Genome Sciences, Inc., Taipei) with mRNA isolated from TF-1 cells cultured in medium with or without GM-CSF. Among several candidates, we confirmed by Northern blot analysis that the TRB2 gene was highly inducible upon GM-CSF deprivation. After removal of GM-CSF, the mRNA levels of TRB2 were up-regulated by 3 h and reached a peak at 24 h (Fig. 1A, lanes 2–5). However, when the cytokine-deprived cells were re-stimulated with GM-CSF, the TRB2 mRNA returned to a base-line level at 3 h (Fig. 1B, lanes 3–5). Furthermore, the induction of TRB2 mRNA by GM-CSF deprivation did not require new protein synthesis, as cycloheximide could not suppress this induction (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 6 and 9). In fact, cycloheximide alone slightly induced TRB2 expression (Fig. 1C, lane 3). This result suggests that TRB2 is an immediate early gene activated by GM-CSF deprivation. Consistent with the increased expression of TRB2 mRNA, the increased TRB2 protein level following GM-CSF deprivation of TF-1 was also observed (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 3). Induction of TRB2 expression was also observed in TF-1 cells that had been previously maintained in another survival cytokine IL-3 or in TF-1 derivatives stably overexpressing IL5R α chain (19Huang H.M. Li J.C. Hsieh Y.C. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) maintained in IL-5 (data not shown). We next examined whether TRB2 could also be induced in other cytokine-dependent cells upon removal of their dependent cytokines. To our surprise, most cell lines examined, including murine GM-CSF-dependent C2GM cells, IL-2-dependent HT-2 cell line, and IL-3-dependent Ba/F3, 32D, and FDCP-1 cells do not manifest this property (data not shown). However, the trb2 mRNA and the TRB2 protein were clearly induced in the activated primary murine (Fig. 1, E and F, respectively) or human (data not shown) CD4+ T cells upon IL-2 deprivation. TRB2 Induction Is Highly Selective—To explore whether TRB2 is a general apoptosis-responsive gene, TF-1 cells were treated with various apoptotic stimuli, including actinomycin D, camptothecin, cycloheximide, dexamethasone, etoposide, staurosporine, and UV irradiation (Fig. 2A). These apoptotic agents, except cycloheximide and dexamethasone, could induce a substantial degree of apoptosis, which was comparable with that induced by GM-CSF deprivation (-GM, Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, the results of Northern blot analysis demonstrated that TRB2 expression was induced profoundly by GM-CSF starvation, and induced slightly by cycloheximide and dexamethasone, but not by other apoptotic treatments (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–19). Because another human tribbles ortholog, TRB3 (also named NIPK or SKIP3), could be induced in PC6-3 cells by nerve growth factor deprivation (26Mayumi-Matsuda K. Kojima S. Suzuki H. Sakata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we investigated whether other members of tribbles are inducible in our experiments. Northern blot analysis showed that in the absence of GM-CSF TRB1 mRNA was only slightly induced (Fig. 2A, top panel), whereas the mRNA of TRB3 was depressed (Fig. 2A, 3rd panel, compare lanes 1 and 2, and 3 and 4). Likewise, the RNA level of TRB1 could be induced slightly by camptothecin (Fig. 2A, 3rd panel, lanes 7 and 8), cycloheximide (lanes 9 and 10), and etoposide (lanes 13 and 14). On the other hand, TRB3 was clearly induced by dexamethasone (Fig. 2A, 3rd panel, lanes 11 and 12) but not by other treatments. In contrast, camptothecin and staurosporine could reduce the expression of TRB3, like the effect of GM-CSF deprivation (Fig. 2A, lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 15, and 16). To extend our observation in TF-1 cells, activated mouse primary CD4+ T cells were subjected to the same treatments and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2B, murine trb2 was induced strongly by IL-2 starvation (lanes 3 and 4), induced slightly by cycloheximide and etoposide, but not induced by other treatments (lanes 5–16), suggesting that a similar induction mechanism may apply to both human and mouse TRB2 genes. We further tested whether TRB2 can be induced by stimuli that activate the extrinsic death pathway. To address this issue, TF-1 cells were treated with cycloheximide plus tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, Fig. 2C) to activate a TNF receptor 1-dependent death signal, or the activated murine CD4+ T cells were treated with IL-2 and CD3 antibody (Fig. 2D) to elicit a CD95-dependent activation-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, in neither case did we observe any significant induction of TRB2 (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Fig. 2C and lanes 4 and 6–8 of Fig. 2D). Altogether, these results suggest that the induction of mammalian tribbles orthologs is highly selective. Ectopic Expression of TRB2 Induces Apoptosis of Many Cell Lines of Hematopoietic Origin—The correlation between induction of TRB2 and apoptosis after cytokine deprivation in TF-1 and activated primary CD4+ T cells prompted us to investigate whether ectopic expression of TRB2 is sufficient to induce apoptosis. To address this issue, a bicistronic expression plasmid pTRB2-IRES-EGFP containing an internal ribosome-entering site (IRES) sequence, which can simultaneously produce the authentic TRB2 and the EGFP (Clontech) (Fig. 3A, panel a), was constructed and introduced into rapidly growing Ba/F3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of TRB2 was readily detectable with anti-TRB2 antibody in Western blot analysis (lane 2). In IL-3-free culture medium overexpression of EGFP alone (Vec) induced apoptosis of 31.6% (±3.4) (n = 5) of transfected cells (i.e. GFP(+) population), whereas overexpression of TRB2 (T2) increased apoptosis to 65.6% (±4.9) (n = 5). In these experiments, we observed consistently that TRB2 expression significantly enhanced IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis of Ba/F3 cells. However, no significant apoptosis-inducing effect was observed for TRB2 when cells were cultured in medium containing IL-3 (data not shown). We next examined whether a similar apoptosis-enhancing effect could be observed for the TRB2-EGFP fusion protein (T2E, Fig. 3D, lane 2), which is encoded by the plasmid pTRB2-EGFP (Fig. 3A, panel b). In the IL-3-containing medium, transfection of Ba/F3 cells with 30 μg of pEGFP-N3 vector usually resulted in 20–30% GFP(+) cells (12 or 20 h post-transfection), whereas under the same conditions, transfection with the pTRB2-EGFP plasmid resulted in only 5–15% GFP(+) cells (see one example shown in supplemental Fig. S1). Of note, although transfection of cells with lower amounts of EGFP or T2E expression vectors (5–15 μg) resulted in lower percentages of GFP(+) cells, the same trend was always observed, i.e. significantly less GFP(+) cells were observed in cells transfected with T2E than with EGFP expression vector (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, we noticed that for cells transfected with the control vector, a majority of GFP(+) cells were TUNEL(-) under confocal microscopy. However, the TUNEL(+)/GFP(+) population in pTRB2-EGFP-transfected cells was significantly increased, even when cells were cultured in the presence of IL-3 (Fig. 3E). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that in one representative experiment, expression of T2E in Ba/F3 cells resulted in 61% of GFP(+) cells to be TUNEL-positive, whereas overexpression of EGFP proteins resulted in only 3% cell death (Fig. 3F, top panels, T2E versus E). Similar percentages of cell death were observed when the apoptotic cells were quantified by the annexin V staining assay (Fig. 3F, bottom panels). Furthermore, T2E-induced cell death was also consistently observed in experiments performed with TF-1 cells (Fig. 3G). Next, we examined whether the apoptotic effect of T2E was mediated through caspase-dependent pathways. As shown in Fig. 3G, T2E-induced apoptosis of either Ba/F3 or TF-1 cells cultured in cytokine-containing medium could be markedly suppressed when cells were treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3G, white versus gray columns). These data suggest that overexpression of the TRB2-EGFP fusion protein could cause cell death with typical apoptotic characteristics. Because TRB2 is a kinase-like protein, we wondered whether any potential kinase activity of TRB2 would be required for its pro-apoptotic function. To address this issue, the lysine residue at the putative catalytic center of subdomain VIB of TRB2, which has the motif RDLKL, was mutated into either arginine (K177R) or alanine (K177A) to create a kinase-dead mutant, and the apoptogenic activity of these two kinase-dead mutants was then compared with that of the wild-type protein. As shown in Fig. 3, H and I, under the same experimental conditions when wild-type and both mutants (all expressed as EGFP fusion proteins, i.e. T2E, K177A-E and K177R-E) were transiently expressed at a similar level in Ba/F cells (Fig. 3H), they all resulted in a similar degree of apoptosis (Fig. 3I), suggesting that the pro-apoptotic function of TRB2 does not require its putative kinase activity. The ability of the TRB2 fusion proteins (T2E) to induce cell death was further investigated in a few other murine and human cell lines. As shown in Fig. 4, T2E induced apoptosis in all cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines tested, including 32D, FDCP-1, and HT-2 (lanes 1–3), although these cell lines did not express TRB2 upon cytokine deprivation (data not shown). Furthermore, the primary murine CD4+ T cells were very sensitive to T2E (Fig. 4, lane 4). On the other hand, some cytokine-independent leukemic cell lines, e.g. WEHI3 and Jurkat (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6), were very sensitive to T2E-induced apoptosis, whereas other cell lines, including K562 and U937 (lanes 8 and 9), were highly resistant. Interestingly, most nonhematopoietic cell lines tested, including HeLa, 293, H1299, and HepG2, were highly resistant to T2E-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4, lanes 10–13). These data suggest that the apoptotic activity of T2E is largely restricted to hematopoietic cells. TRB2-EGFP Triggers Apoptosis via Mitochondria Dys-function—A variety of external and internal signals converge on mitochondria to trigger or inhibit apoptosis (27Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of the apoptotic effect of TRB2, we investigated the ability of T2E to damage mitochondria. The mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red was used to stain the viable cells, because apoptotic cells lost membrane potential and lost the staining of MitoTracker Red. As shown in one representative result (Fig. 5A), expression of T2E in Ba/F3 cells increased dramatically the proportion of cells that lost the membrane potential, from 10 to 78% (see ΔΨmL). Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, ΔΨm) correlated strongly with activation of caspases, including caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 (Fig. 5A), and the percentage of cells that have undergone apoptosis as revealed by the annexin V (An-V) staining method. T2E-induced activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, as evident from the generation of specific cleavage products, was also demonstrated in TF-1 cells by Western blotting with antibody specifically recognizing each caspase (Fig. 5B). Of note, under our experimental conditions, although the cleaved form of caspase-3 was only slightly detectable, the production of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a typical caspase 3 substrate, was quite prominent (Fig. 5B, 2nd to the bottom panel), suggesting that caspase-3 was also highly activated by T2E in TF-1 cells. We next examined whether T2E could induce activation of Bax, a proapoptotic molecule that, in response to apoptotic stimuli, will change conformation and oligomerize, which leads to mitochondria dysfunction (28Griffiths G.J.

KplE1 is defective for lysis, but it is fully competent for excisive recombination. In this study, we have mapped the binding sites of the recombination proteins, namely IntS, TorI, and IHF on attL and attR, and the organization of these sites suggests that the intasome is architecturally different from the λ canonical form. We also measured the relative contribution of these proteins to both excisive and integrative recombination by using a quantitative in vitro assay. These experiments show a requirement of the TorI excisionase for excisive recombination and of the IntS integrase for both integration and excision. Moreover, we observed a strong influence of the supercoiled state of the substrates. The KplE1 recombination module, composed of the integrase and excisionase genes together with the attL and attR DNA regions, is highly similar to that of several phages infecting various E. coli strains as well as Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei.

This study thus defines a new site-specific recombination module, and implications for the mechanism and regulation of recombination are discussed. Phage λ has long served as a model system for studies of regulated site-specific recombination (1Nash H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 2363-2376Google Scholar). Indeed, bacteriophages such as λ may choose between the lytic and the lysogenic cycle for their propagation in the bacterial host (2Court D.L. Oppenheim A.B. Adhya S. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In conditions favorable for bacterial growth the phage genome is inserted into the host genome by an integrative recombination reaction, which takes place between DNA attachment sites called attP and attB, in the phage and the bacterial genome, respectively. As a result, the integrated λ DNA (or prophage DNA) is bounded by hybrid attachment sites, termed attL and attR. In response to a change in the physiological state of the bacteria, mainly in response to stress conditions such as DNA damage, λ phage DNA is excised from the host chromosome. This excisive reaction recombines attL and attR to restore the attP and attB sites on the circular λ and Escherichia coli genomes (recently reviewed in Ref. 3Oppenheim A.B. Kobiler O. Stavans J.

Robertson C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9246-9253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The host-encoded integration host factor (IHF) is required for both integration and excision, whereas the phage-encoded excisionase (Xis) is necessary for excision only and prevents re-integration (5Abremski K.

Moreover, directionality of the excisive reaction is conferred by the irreversibility of multiple reaction steps (10Mumm J.P. Landy A. Gelles J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4586-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The phage-encoded integrase is a heterobivalent DNA-binding protein. It consists of a large C-terminal domain that binds to core-type DNA sequences and carries out the enzymatic steps of recombination (11Tirumalai R.S. Kwon H.J. Cardente E.H. Ellenberger T. Landy A.

Additionally, Int contains a small N-terminal domain that binds to arm-type DNA sites that are distant from the sites of DNA strand exchange (13Wojciak J.M. Sarkar D. Landy A. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl.

A four-way DNA junction (Holliday junction) is formed by the cleavage, exchange, and ligation of one pair of strands (14Kitts P.A. Nash H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6839-6856Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

Gene disruption can occur by prophage integration into the bacterial genome. Prophage genes can confer selective advantage through a superinfection mechanism, and they often increase the pathogenic properties of some strains for example through the acquisition of toxin genes. In the lysogenic state, prophages occasionally mutate to loose some of the functions essential for lytic growth, in which case the strain is no longer able to liberate infectious particles (20Campbell A.M. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: cellular and Molecular Biology. SM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 2041-2046Google Scholar). Such prophages are termed defective, but nevertheless they can inactivate host genes or conserve genes important for host pathogenicity or fitness. The KplE1 prophage (also named CPS-53) is one of the 10 prophage regions present in E. coli K12 MG1655 (21Rudd K.E. Res. Microbiol. 1999; 150: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Casjens S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The boundaries of KplE1 prophage are 16-bp-duplicated core sequences (CTGCAGGGGACACCAT) separated by 10.216 kb outlined by the argW tRNA gene and the dsdC gene, and composed of 16 open reading frames (Fig. 1). The torI gene is the last gene of the KplE1 prophage genome, originally identified using a genetic multicopy approach as a negative regulator of the torCAD operon that encodes the trimethylamine oxide reductase respiratory system in E. coli (23Ansaldi M. Théraulaz L. Méjean V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The negative effect was due to a previously unidentified small open reading frame (66 amino acids) that we called torI for Tor inhibition. The torI gene is part of the KplE1 prophage genome, because it is located upstream of the 3′ core sequence that marks the end of this prophage. Several lines of evidence lead us to propose TorI as an excisionase protein: (i) it shares several properties with other recombination directionality factor (RDF) proteins such as a small size and a basic pI (25Casjens S.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Lewis J.A. Hatfull G.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2205-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and (ii) despite no primary sequence homology, the TorI three-dimensional structure is highly homologous to that of λXis and Tn916Xis proteins (27ElAntak L. Ansaldi M. Guerlesquin F. Méjean V. Morelli X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36802-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the role of TorI in KplE1 excision, we developed an in vivo excision assay and observed that overexpression of the torI gene rapidly led to the complete excision of KplE1 (27ElAntak L. Ansaldi M. Guerlesquin F. Méjean V. Morelli X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36802-36808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyze more precisely the site-specific recombination process of the KplE1 prophage. We show that the IntS integrase promotes KplE1 excision together with the TorI excisionase. We present a detailed analysis of the recombination sites of KplE1 that are highly homologous to that of Sf6 and HK620 phages and of strains K1 RS218, UTI89, APEC-O1, and SsO46 prophages. These are the closest relatives of KplE1 considering the site-specific recombination module composed of the integrase and excisionase genes and the recombination DNA sequences attL and attR. Bacterial Strains, Phage, Plasmids, Primers, Media, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains, phage, plasmids, and primers are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown in LB medium and, when necessary, ampicillin (50 μg.ml-1), chloramphenicol (25 μg.ml-1), kanamycin (50 μg.ml-1), or isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) were added.TABLE 1Strains, phage, plasmids, and primersCharacteristic or sequenceReferenceStrains MC4100araD139 Δ(lacIPOZYA-argF) U169 rpsL thiM.

Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11196) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cat gene was PCR-amplified using the pKD3 as a template with the primer pair ΔintS1/ΔintS2, and the product was recombined into strain MC4100 containing plasmid pKD20. The cat gene was then removed by using the pCP20 plasmid to generate strain LCB1024 (intS, CmS). The truncated intS gene was verified by PCR amplification of the chromosomal region (primer pair Nde-intS/ΔintS2). Strain LCB1031 is a derivative of strain ENZ1734 (MG1655 ΔlacIZ) where the intS::CmR construction (LCB1007 source) was P1-transduced. The cat gene was then removed to generate strain LCB1032 (intS, CmS). Strains LCB1033 and LCB1034 are derivatives of strains LCB1032 and ENZ1734, respectively, obtained by P1 transduction of the pcnB::TcR marker (LCB506 source). Strain LCB1019 was constructed by overexpressing the torI gene in the wild-type strain MC4100 (pJFi plus isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 1 mm). The pJFi was then cured by several isolations on LB medium without ampicillin. The presence of attB, and thus the absence of the KplE1 prophage region, was verified by PCR amplification of the chromosomal region (primer pair attL-SpeI/attR-XbaI). Plasmid Construction—To construct plasmid pETintS, the intS coding sequence was PCR-amplified using MC4100 chromosomal DNA as a template. We used the primer Nde-intS that contains an NdeI site followed by the 5′ of the intS coding sequence and the primer Hind3-intS that contains a HindIII site followed by the 3′ end of the intS coding sequence. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR product was cloned into corresponding sites of the pET22(b) vector. To construct plasmid pBpr + intS, the 5′ coding sequence of intS, as well as the 84 nucleotides upstream, were PCR-amplified using MC4100 chromosomal DNA as a template. We used the primer pr + intS1 that contains a KpnI site followed by a sequence complementary to the putative promoter of intS and the primer Hind3-intS that contains a HindIII site followed by the 3′ end of the intS coding sequence. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the PCR product was cloned into the corresponding sites of pBAD33 vector. The different patt plasmids were constructed by insertion of att linear products into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). attLKplE1 and attRKplE1 were PCR-amplified using MC4100 chromosomal DNA as a template with the primer pairs attL-SpeI/attL-KpnI and attR-XbaI/attR-IHF2, respectively. attLHK620 and attRHK620 were PCR-amplified with the same primer pairs using DNA of a HK620 in vitro integration assay as a template. attPHK620 was PCR-amplified using HK620 phage suspension as a template with the primer pair attR-XbaI/attL-SpeI. attPKplE1 was PCR-amplified with the same primer pair using the DNA of an in vitro excision assay as a template. attB was PCR-amplified using LCB1019 chromosomal DNA as a template with the primer pair attR-XbaI/attL-SpeI. Plasmid pGEattL was constructed by insertion of the attL region (region covering the core sequence to the start codon of the intS gene) upstream of a ′lacZ gene. The attL region was PCR-amplified using the primer pair attL-pro/attL-ter and MC4100 chromosomal DNA as a template. The PCR product was directly cloned into a blunt site (SmaI) of the pGE593 vector. Sequence accuracy of the cloned inserts was checked by sequencing. All primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Protein Purifications—IHF and TorI proteins were overproduced and purified as described (23Ansaldi M. Théraulaz L. Méjean V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9423-9428Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Murtin C. Engelhorn M. Geiselmann J. Boccard F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). IntS was produced from C41(DE3) harboring plasmid pETintS. Cells were grown in LB medium with ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.8 unit, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added for 2 h at 37 °C. French-pressed extract was equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and loaded onto a HiTrap heparin HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a step gradient of KCl and was found in the 0.6 and 0.7 m KCl containing fractions. These fractions were pooled and diluted to reach 0.1 m KCl before loading onto a HiTrap SP FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The protein was eluted with a step gradient of KCl and was found in the fraction containing 0.4 m KCl. The protein was then dialyzed against 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10% glycerol. The purity of TorI, IntS, and IHF was estimated by running the purified fractions onto a 20% SDS-Tris/Tricine-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The absence of contamination of TorI and IntS by IHF was checked by Western blot using IHF antisera. The protein concentrations were estimated by the Lowry method. DNA Fragment Labeling—Primers were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (4000 Ci.mmol-1) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI). The labeled primers were separated from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP by using the Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen). attL and attR DNA fragment were PCR-amplified by using MC4100 chromosomal DNA as a template with appropriate labeled and unlabeled primers (attL-pro/attL-ter primers for the attL region and attR-XbaI/attR-IHF2 for the attR region). DNase I Footprinting—The footprint assays were performed as follows: the labeled DNA fragment was diluted to a concentration of ∼1 nm in 50 μl of binding mix (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 40 ng.μl-1 poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) to which different amounts of the purified IHF, IntS, or TorI (0.03–0.5 μm) were added. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, DNase I was added (0.07 unit, Invitrogen), and the reaction was conducted for 1 min, then stopped by the addition of 140 μl of DNase Stop Solution (192 mm sodium acetate, 32 mm EDTA, 0.14% SDS, and 64 μg.ml-1 yeast RNA). After DNA ethanol-precipitation in the presence of DNA carrier (Pellet Paint co-precipitant, Novagen), the pellets were resuspended in a loading dye solution (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% xylene cyanol) and loaded onto a 8% polyacrylamide/6 m urea electrophoresis gel. The locations of the protected nucleotides were deduced by running a ladder with products of the G + A cleavage reaction according to Maxam and Gilbert. In Vivo Excision Assay and intS Complementation—Strain MC4100 carrying plasmids pJFi and pBAD33 and strain LCB1024 carrying plasmids pJFi and pBpr + intS were grown in LB medium until the A600 reached 0.5 unit (0.5 × 109 cells ml-1). Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was then added for 2 h at 37°C under agitation. Culture dilutions were prepared and plated onto rich medium containing ampicillin. A basic PCR amplification was performed on 10 randomly chosen colonies (30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 55 °C, and 30-s elongation at 72 °C) using the GoTaq® DNA polymerase (Promega) and specific primer pairs to test the presence of attL, attR, and attB, respectively. In Vitro Integration and Excision Assays—Purified IHF, IntS, and TorI were used in all experiments. All reaction mixtures (25 μl) included linear and/or supercoiled att sites (32 nm) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm spermidine, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mg.ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol. IntS (0.8 μm), IHF (0.8 μm), and TorI (1.6 μm) were added as indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were carried out in optimized conditions: 37 °C for 1 h at an IntS:IHF:TorI protein ratio of 1:1:2. In vitro excision assays, with linear attL and attR products, were separated onto a 2.5% agarose gel after a DNA purification step with the PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). Real-time PCR Analysis—The abundance of attP formed during in vitro excision assays (attL and attR substrates) and the abundance of attR formed during in vitro integration assays (attB and attP substrates) were quantified by real-time PCR. For each reaction, a known concentration of PCR-amplified attP and attR was used as a reference standard for excision and integration assays, respectively. The real-time PCR quantifications were performed at the IBSM genomic facility (Marseille, France) on diluted in vitro reaction products, using the Light-Cycler instrument and the LightCycler Fast Start DNA masterplus SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) with external standards as described in Roche Molecular Biochemical technical note LC 11/2000. Different dilutions of each reaction of the in vitro integration and excision assays were then mixed with 0.5 μm of each primer and 2 μl of master mix in a 10-μl final volume. The primer pairs used to quantify attP and attR were attR-XbaI/attL-SpeI and attR-XbaI/attR-IHF2, respectively (Table 1). PCR assay parameters were one cycle at 95 °C for 8 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 6 s, and 72 °C for 12 s. Excision and integration percentages were calculated using the initial substrate concentration (32 nm) as the 100% reference (Tables 2 and 3). The real-time PCR results represent the average of at least three independent measurements with no more than 12% variation from the mean.TABLE 2Efficiency of excision reactions performed with either KplE1 or HK620, attL, and attR substrates The numbers indicate the amount of substrate transformed into attP product expressed in percentage.attL/ + attR/aSlash symbols indicate linear substrates, whereas circles indicate plasmid-cloned substratesattL/ + attR OattL O + attR/attL O + attR OKplE1 substrates No protein<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS + TorI9 ± 370 ± 767 ± 82 ± 2 IntS + IHF<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS + TorI + IHF17 ± 985 ± 1185 ± 1267 ± 9HK620 substrates No protein<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS + TorI13 ± 347 ± 669 ± 810 ± 4 IntS + IHF0.5 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.2<0.1<0.1 IntS + TorI + IHF22 ± 874 ± 886 ± 1257 ± 9a Slash symbols indicate linear substrates, whereas circles indicate plasmid-cloned substrates Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Efficiency of integration reactions performed with either KplE1 or HK620, attB, and attP substrates The numbers indicate the amount of substrate transformed into attR product expressed in percentage.attB/ + attP/aSlash symbols indicate linear substrates, whereas circles indicate plasmid-cloned substratesattB/ + attP OattB O + attP/attB O + attP OKplE1 substrates No protein<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS<0.16 ± 10.5 ± 0.411 ± 1 IntS + TorI<0.11 ± 0.63 ± 11 ± 0.5 IntS + IHF<0.124 ± 29 ± 241 ± 1 IntS + TorI + IHF0.5 ± 0.41 ± 0.31 ± 0.31 ± 0.2HK620 substrates No protein<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.1 IntS<0.16 ± 30.5 ± 0.35 ± 3 IntS + TorI<0.11 ± 0.51 ± 0.41 ± 0.5 IntS + IHF<0.135 ± 126 ± 234 ± 10 IntS + TorI + IHF0.5 ± 0.21 ± 0.61 ± 0.21 ± 0.5a Slash symbols indicate linear substrates, whereas circles indicate plasmid-cloned substrates Open table in a new tab Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—The relative abundance of intS mRNA was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Two specific primer pairs intS-L/intS-R and intS-L2/intS-R2 with ∼50 guanine-cytosine percent and 55 °C melting temperature were designed using the Primer3 software. The first pair (intS-L/intS-R) amplifies a region of 202 bp starting from intS codon 215. The second pair (intS-L2/intS-R2) amplifies a region of 155 bp that starts before the intS start codon (-10 bp) and goes up to the 48th codon; this pair thus allows amplification of intS mRNA in an intS-defective background. Total RNAs from ∼109 cells of MC4100 and LCB1024 strains grown aerobically up to mid-log phase were extracted using the PureYield™ RNA Midiprep System (Promega). RNAs were then retrotranscribed with random nonamers using the Superscript II™ RNase H- (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 50 min, and then treated at 70 °C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme. The real-time PCR quantifications were performed as described above. The real-time PCR experiments were performed twice, with both independent total RNA and cDNA preparations by the comparative threshold cycle method and results are expressed in arbitrary units (AU). β-Galactosidase Assay—β-Galactosidase activities were measured on whole cells by the Miller method (52Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) after aerobic growth at 37 °C for 6 h. Values represent the averages of at least three independent experiments with no more than 15% variation from the mean. In Vivo Requirement of the intS Gene for KplE1 Excision—The IntS integrase is encoded at the 5′ extremity of the KplE1 genome (Fig. 1). To check if intS was essential for KplE1 excision we constructed an intS-defective strain (LCB1024). The E. coli K12 genome contains 10 putative integrase genes of the tyrosine recombinase family (30Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids"
https://openalex.org/W2069573950,"C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) are cellular corepressors that are targeted by adenovirus E1A. A conserved motif of E1A (PLDLS) interacts with an N-terminal hydrophobic cleft of CtBPs. Many cellular cofactors also interact with CtBPs through PLDLS-like motifs. E1A interaction with CtBP2 changed the composition of the CtBP2 protein complex and enhanced CtBP2 acetylation. We have identified a mutant of CtBP2 (M48A) that fails to interact with cellular cofactors while interacting normally with E1A. Other cleft mutations in CtBP2 affected interaction of both cellular cofactors and E1A. The M48A mutant did not repress the cellular E-cadherin promoter but inhibited transactivation mediated by the E1A N-terminal region through interaction with the E1A PLDLS motif. In vitro, E1A enhanced CtBP2 acetylation by p300 via a mechanism involving dissociation of acetylated CtBP2 from p300. E1A enhanced nuclear localization of CtBP1 as well as a cytoplasmically localized acetylation-deficient mutant of CtBP2 (3KR-CtBP2) through PLDLS-dependent interaction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed presence of CtBP2 on E-cadherin and c-fos promoters. While E1A did not significantly alter targeting of CtBP2 to the E-cadherin and c-fos promoters, it dramatically enhanced promoter targeting of 3KR-CtBP2. Our results raise a possibility that E1A may gain access to cellular promoters through PLDLS-dependent interaction with CtBPs."
https://openalex.org/W2082632144,"We show that cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAspAT) is involved in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis, a regulated pathway that controls fatty acid homeostasis by promoting glycerol 3-phosphate formation for fatty acid re-esterification during fasting. cAspAT activity, as well as the incorporation of [14C]aspartate into the neutral lipid fraction of 3T3-F442A adipocytes was stimulated by the thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone. Conversely, the ratio of fatty acid to glycerol released into the medium decreased. Regulation of cAspAT gene expression was specific to differentiated adipocytes and did not require any peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)/retinoid X receptor-α direct binding. Nevertheless, PPARγ is indirectly necessary for both cAspAT basal expression and TZD responsiveness because they are, respectively, diminished and abolished by ectopic overexpression of a dominant negative PPARγ. The cAspAT TZD-responsive site was restricted to a single AGGACA hexanucleotide located at -381 to -376 bp whose mutation impaired the specific RORα binding. RORα ectopic expression activated the cAspAT gene transcription in absence of rosiglitazone, and its protein amount in nuclear extracts is 1.8-fold increased by rosiglitazone treatment of adipocytes. Finally, the amounts of RORα and cAspAT mRNAs were similarly increased by TZD treatment of human adipose tissue explants, confirming coordinated regulation. Our data identify cAspAT as a new member of glyceroneogenesis, transcriptionally regulated by TZD via the control of RORα expression by PPARγ in adipocytes. We show that cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAspAT) is involved in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis, a regulated pathway that controls fatty acid homeostasis by promoting glycerol 3-phosphate formation for fatty acid re-esterification during fasting. cAspAT activity, as well as the incorporation of [14C]aspartate into the neutral lipid fraction of 3T3-F442A adipocytes was stimulated by the thiazolidinedione (TZD) rosiglitazone. Conversely, the ratio of fatty acid to glycerol released into the medium decreased.

Our data identify cAspAT as a new member of glyceroneogenesis, transcriptionally regulated by TZD via the control of RORα expression by PPARγ in adipocytes. Glyceroneogenesis (a largely unexplored pathway) is an abbreviated version of gluconeogenesis that produces glycerol-3-P from precursors other than glycerol or glucose in adipose tissue when glucose utilization is reduced (1Hanson W.H.

Glyceroneogenesis is increased during fasting and allows the re-esterification of fatty acids (FAs) 5The abbreviations used are: FAs, fatty acids; PEPCK-C, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; TZDs, thiazolidinediones; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; cAspAT, cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase; RORα, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-α; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; RXRα, retinoid X receptor-α; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PEI, polyethyleneimine; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-responsive element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; D, day; DN, dominant-negative; DR, direct repeat; NRREs, nuclear receptor-responsive elements; h, human. 5The abbreviations used are: FAs, fatty acids; PEPCK-C, cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; TZDs, thiazolidinediones; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ; cAspAT, cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase; RORα, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-α; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; RXRα, retinoid X receptor-α; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PEI, polyethyleneimine; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-responsive element; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; D, day; DN, dominant-negative; DR, direct repeat; NRREs, nuclear receptor-responsive elements; h, human. for triacylglycerol synthesis at a time when their breakdown is occurring through lipolysis (4Reshef L.

This re-esterification pathway was proposed several decades ago as a regulatory control process developed by adipocytes to prevent an all-out release of FAs into the blood (5Vaughan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3354-3358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1994-2001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Reshef L. Hanson R.W. Ballard F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5979-5984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-C) is a critical step in glyceroneogenesis (4Reshef L. Olswang Y. Cassuto H. Blum B. Croniger C.M. Kalhan S.C. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30413-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of PEPCK-C in FA homeostasis and storage was definitively confirmed by the phenotypes of mice in which adipocyte PEPCK-C gene expression was either invalidated or overexpressed. Invalidation of the PEPCK-C gene in white adipose tissue of mice results in lipodystrophy and predisposition to insulin resistance (8Olswang Y. Cohen H. Papo O. Cassuto H. Croniger C.M. Hakimi P. Tilghman S.M. Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice that constitutively overexpress the PEPCK-C gene in adipose tissue become obese because of increased FA storage, without exhibiting any increase in their plasma FA levels (9Franckhauser S. Munoz S. Pujol A. Casellas A. Riu E. Otaegui P. Su B. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), unless they are fed a normolipidic diet (10Franckhauser S. Munoz S. Elias I. Ferre T. Bosch F. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the control of FA homeostasis exerted by glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue, together with an equilibrated diet, could participate in the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Indeed, a sustained increase in plasma non-esterified FAs, a situation that occurs with a high fat diet and in lipodystrophy, can be a leading cause of insulin resistance and ultimately of type 2 diabetes (11Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are the latest generation of antidiabetic drugs that are able to normalize several plasma parameters. However, their mechanism of action is not yet completely understood. Because TZDs are the most well known ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), a transcription factor that is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue (12Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar), and because TZDs are potent stimulators of selective PEPCK-C gene expression in adipocytes (13Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TZDs could exert some of their hypolipidemic action by inducing glyceroneogenesis, thereby reducing FA output from adipose tissue. Indeed, we identified this metabolic pathway as a TZD target in cultured adipocytes and fat tissue of Wistar rats (14Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and, more recently, in human subcutaneous adipose tissue (15Leroyer S.N. Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Chapron C. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13141-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), thus confirming that the glyceroneogenesis-dependent FA-lowering effect of TZDs could be an essential aspect of the antidiabetic action of these drugs.Cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (cAspAT; EC 2.6.1.1) is coupled with PEPCK-C for liver gluconeogenesis because it produces its substrate (16Katunuma N. Okada M. Nishii Y. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1966; 4: 317-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Ferre P. Williamson D.H. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 335-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAspAT gene expression is regulated by glucocorticoids, as is the expression of other genes belonging to this pathway (18Pave-Preux M. Ferry N. Bouguet J. Hanoune J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17459-17466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Aggerbeck M. Garlatti M. Feilleux-Duche S. Veyssier C. Daheshia M. Hanoune J. Barouki R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9065-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar to PEPCK-C, cAspAT is down-regulated by glucose and up-regulated by a low glucose/high protein diet in adipose tissue (20Plee-Gautier E. Aggerbeck M. Beurton F. Antoine B. Grimal H. Barouki R. Forest C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4936-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 21Horio Y. Tanaka T. Taketoshi M. Uno T. Wada H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulated that cAspAT might be involved in glyceroneogenesis in adipose tissue under conditions of restrained glucose transport and availability.In this work, we show that cAspAT is functionally involved in glyceroneogenesis in adipocytes in which transcription of its gene is induced by TZDs, thus allowing increased glycerol-3-P production and, ultimately, triacylglycerol synthesis from aspartate. Surprisingly, the TZD responsiveness of cAspAT was found to be dependent upon both PPARγ and protein synthesis. The TZD-responsive region of the gene promoter was identified as a unique AGGTCA sequence that bound retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-α (RORα), but not PPARγ. RORα4 was able to transactivate the cAspAT promoter, and its amount was increased in nuclear extracts from TZD-treated adipocytes. RORα4 is thus suggested to be a transcription factor involved in the regulation of cAspAT gene expression by TZD because its own expression is controlled by rosiglitazone.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Treatment—3T3-F442A, 3T3-C2, and BFC-115 adipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing glucose (25 mm), penicillin (200 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/liter), biotin (2 mg/liter), and pantothenate (4 mg/liter) with 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and 90% air. At confluence, newborn calf serum was changed to 10% fetal calf serum, and insulin (20 nm) was added to the medium to initiate adipocyte differentiation. The medium was changed every 2-3 days. Experiments were carried out using differentiated adipocytes (8-10 days after confluence) unless described otherwise, and drug treatments were performed as described in the legends to the figures. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was induced with isobutylmethylxanthine, insulin, and dexamethasone as described previously (22Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum and then transfected (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science) by PPARγ and retinoid X receptor-α (RXRα) expression vectors before nuclear extract isolation. The human adipose tissue came from normal weight patients who participated in the study described by Leroyer et al. (15Leroyer S.N. Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Chapron C. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13141-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Human adipose tissue explants were cut into small pieces (∼20 mg), rinsed, and incubated in the same medium as that used for 3T3-F442 adipocytes but with the addition of 1 μm rosiglitazone or ethanol for 24 h before RNA extraction.Functional Analysis—For glyceroneogenesis studies, mature 3T3-F442A adipocytes in 6-well dishes were treated for 72 h with either ethanol or 1 μm rosiglitazone in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was then replaced with glucose- and serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.3% FA-free bovine serum albumin. Four hours later, the incorporation of a glyceroneogenic substrate was evaluated by adding 2 ml of Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer containing 0.3% FA-free bovine serum albumin (Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer/bovine serum albumin) with either 2 mm aspartate or pyruvate and 1 μCi of [14C]aspartate or [14C1]pyruvate in the presence of 150 μm 3-mercaptopicolinic acid as indicated. One hour later, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate). Lipids were extracted by the simplified method of Bligh and Dyer (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.G. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-916Crossref Scopus (42153) Google Scholar), and [14C]aspartate or [14C1]pyruvate incorporation was estimated by counting the radioactivity in the lipid fraction. Fatty acid and glycerol release was measured under lipolytic conditions as follows: 1 h after adding 1 μm isoproterenol to the cells, glycerol and fatty acid concentrations were measured in the cultured medium using kits from Sigma and Roche Applied Science, respectively.For cAspAT activity, 3T3-F442A adipocytes were collected in extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8) containing 40 mm KCl, 11 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cell lysate was adjusted to 4 mm α-ketoglutarate to protect the cytosolic isoenzyme, and the cell lysate was incubated at 70 °C for 8 min to destroy mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase according to Parli et al. (24Parli J.A. Godfrey D.A. Ross C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, cAspAT activity was measured according the instructions provided by ABX Diagnostics (Montpellier, France), and protein content was determined by the BCA assay (Sigma).RNA Extraction and Analysis—The cells were treated for 24 h with either 1 μm rosiglitazone or 5 μm pioglitazone in DMEM containing 5% dialyzed serum. RNA was extracted by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences). The integrity and relative amounts of RNA were assessed by methylene blue staining. Prehybridization and hybridization of the blots were carried out using QuickHyb solution (Stratagene). Membranes were hybridized for 1 h at 68 °C with 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 106 cpm/ml cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were washed twice for 15 min at room temperature with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and then for 30 min at 60 °C with 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC. The specific probes used were PC116, a rat PEPCK-C cDNA fragment (26Beale E.G. Chrapkiewicz N.B. Scoble H.A. Metz R.J. Quick D.P. Noble R.L. Donelson J.E. Biemann K. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10748-10760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cAspAT and mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase cDNA fragments as described (18Pave-Preux M. Ferry N. Bouguet J. Hanoune J. Barouki R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17459-17466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide specific for the 18 S rRNA was 32P-labeled and used as a control as described previously (20Plee-Gautier E. Aggerbeck M. Beurton F. Antoine B. Grimal H. Barouki R. Forest C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4936-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). mRNA signals were quantified using an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.) and corrected for differences in RNA loading by comparison with the signals generated by the 18 S cDNA probe.Total RNA from 200 mg of human adipose tissue was isolated with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.). Real-time PCR was performed using a Roche Diagnostics LightCycler and LightCycler SYBR Green fluorophore. The following primers were used: RORα, GTCAGCAGCTTCTACCTGGAC and GTGTTGTTCTGAGAGTGAAAGGCACG; cAspAT, TTCTGTTCCCCTTCTTTGAC and GATTCCCCACTCTCTCATTG; and 18 S rRNA, GAGCGAAAGCATTTGCCAAG and GGCATCGTTTATGGTCGGAA. Each PCR experiment was normalized to the amount of 18 S rRNA.Transient Transfection and Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Assays—The experiments were carried out on 8-day post-confluent differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes using the polyethyleneimine (PEI) adenofection method described previously (27Meunier-Durmort C. Grimal H. Sachs L.M. Demeneix B.A. Forest C. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 808-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each 25-mm plate, 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA and an amount of 25-kDa PEI corresponding to a PEI nitrogen/DNA phosphate ratio of 1.5 were diluted into 16.6 μl of 0.15 m NaCl and then mixed together for 15 min with intermittent vigorous vortexing. Polycation·DNA complexes and a non-replication-deficient adenoviral vector containing the Rous sarcoma virus nuclear localization sequence and the lacZ gene (20-400 plaque-forming units) were then diluted into 2 ml of serum-free medium and added to culture dishes. Seven hours later, the medium was discarded, and cells were rinsed twice with serum-free medium and allowed to recover for 16 h before the addition of various effectors in DMEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 48 h. Cells were then scraped and homogenized as detailed (28Antras-Ferry J. Franckhauser S. Robin D. Robin P. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CAT assays were performed as described by Seed and Sheen (29Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and protein content was measured by the BCA assay. The rat gene promoter-CAT constructs used were -2405-cAspAT, -553-cAspAT, -398-cAspAT, -286-cAspAT, and -177-cAspAT (30Garlatti M. Tchesnokov V. Daheshia M. Feilleux-Duche S. Hanoune J. Aggerbeck M.

The three mutations of the AGGTCA hexanucleotides in the -553-cAspAT construct were as described (31Tomkiewicz C. Muzeau F. Edgar A.D. Barouki R. Aggerbeck M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The expression vector encoding dominant-negative PPARγ (pSG5-DN-PPARγ) was constructed according to Gurnell et al. (32Gurnell M. Wentworth J.M. Agostini M. Adams M. Collingwood T.N. Provenzano C. Browne P.O. Rajanayagam O. Burris T.P. Schwabe J.W. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol.

Giguere (McGill University, Quebec, Canada) (33Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 538-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. J.-L. Danan (CNRS UPR 9078). Transfection of 3T3-C2 cells was performed 8 days post-confluence by the FuGENE 6 technique according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Nuclear Extract Preparation and Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear proteins were extracted from 3T3-F442A adipocytes (control or 18-h TZD-treated) at different stages of differentiation and from COS-7 cells in which PPARγ and RXRα were ectopically expressed. Cells were scraped on ice and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the pellet was dissolved in 1× buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.002% NaN3) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 5100 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 420 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3. After a 30-min incubation, the solution was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing nuclear protein was mixed (v/v) with 20 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3, aliquoted, and stored in liquid nitrogen.For gel mobility shift assays, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the cAspAT sequences and PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) sequences (PCK2) from the rat PEPCK-C gene (13Glorian M. Duplus E. Beale E.G. Scott D.K. Granner D.K. Forest C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 933-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and the acyl-CoA oxidase gene (34Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocrinol. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2707) Google Scholar) were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow polymerase. Nuclear extracts containing 10 μg of protein were incubated on ice for 30 min with 6 μl of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) mixture (17.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 mm MgCl2, 8% glycerol, and 500 ng poly(dI-dC)) and 0.5 ng of the labeled probe; VF-15 μl. DNA·protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (0.5 m Tris, 0.5 m boric acid, and 5 mm EDTA). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). For supershift analysis, 1 or 2 μl of anti-PPARγ antibody (catalog no. sc-1984X) or anti-RORα antibody (catalog no. sc-6062X) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was preincubated at room temperature for 15 min with the nuclear extracts before the binding reaction.Unlabeled RORα1 and RORα4 proteins were obtained in vitro from the pCMX-hRORα1 or pCMX-hRORα4 vector (kind gifts of Dr. V. Giguere) using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega Corp.). DNA·protein complexes were allowed to form by incubating aliquots of the programmed lysates for 20 min on ice as described by Chauvet et al. (35Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Fontaine C. Gervois P. Bernard M-A. Staels B. Danan J.-L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 25: 2517-2526Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, double-stranded oligonucleotides were added simultaneously with the labeled probe.Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: AspAT7, 5′-GCC CCA GGT CTC CAG GAC CCA GAA GGT CAG GAG GCT GTC CTC TAG GGA CT-3′; AspAT9, 5′-GAC TCC CGC CAC CCG CAT CAT CCT CAT CAC CCT AAG GAA TAA AAG CCT CAG CGA TTG GAA-3′; AspAT11, 5′-GGA ACA CGC TAT GCC AAT CAT CCT AGT CTT TG-3′; PCK2, 5′-GGT TCT TCA CAA CTG GGA TCC TGG TCT CGC TGC TCA AG-3′; acyl-CoA oxidase, 5′-GG ACC AGG ACA AAG GTC ACG TT-3; Sp1, 5′-TGA AGC CCG CCC CAA CGG-3′; -404/-374 bp cAspAT, 5′-A GGA CCC AGA AGG TCA GGA GGC TGT CCT CT-3′; Mut1, 5′-A GGA CCC AGA AGG CAG GGA GGC TGT CCT CT-3′; Mut2, 5′-A GGA CCC AGA AGG TCA GGA CGC TGT CCT CT-3′; Mut3, 5′-A GGA CCC AGA AGG TCA GGA GGC TGT CGT CT-3′; hFibb-360-RORE, 5′-GAT CTG TGA GTA GGT CAA ATA-3′; and hFibb-ROREmut, 5′-GCC TTG TGA GTA GGC CTA ATT TAC-3′.Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of 3T3-F442A adipocyte nuclear extracts (25 μg) and RORα-programmed lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with antiserum against RORα (catalog no. sc-6062, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as described previously (36Chauvet C. Bois-Joyeux B. Danan J-L. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Amounts of protein were quantified with a Typhoon 9400 (Amersham Biosciences) and standardized versus respective actin amounts.RESULTSInvolvement of cAspAT in Adipocyte Glyceroneogenesis: Induction by Rosiglitazone—We have shown previously that rosiglitazone is able to stimulate [14C1]pyruvate incorporation into adipocyte triacylglycerols (14Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This leads to an increase in FA re-esterification and thus in the reduction of FA release into the culture medium (14Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) when the cells are in a lipolytic situation. This effect depends on PEPCK-C activity because it is prevented by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, an inhibitor of this enzyme. To determine whether cAspAT is also involved in glyceroneogenesis, we carried out a similar experiment using [14C]aspartate as a potential precursor of glycerol-3-P. Aspartate is the substrate for cAspAT and allows the generation of oxalacetate, the substrate of PEPCK-C. Thus, cAspAT could act upstream of PEPCK-C in the glyceroneogenic pathway. Fig. 1A shows that [14C]aspartate was in fact incorporated into the neutral lipid fraction of 3T3-F442 adipocytes, although to a lower extent than pyruvate, and thus could be a precursor of glycerol-3-P for FA re-esterification. Pretreatment of the cells with rosiglitazone for 72 h increased aspartate incorporation by 2-fold compared with the 2.5-fold increase for pyruvate and was abolished by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, suggesting a role for PEPCK-C.To further evaluate the association of these results with cAspAT, we measured its enzyme activity. As soon as 12 h after the beginning of the rosiglitazone treatment, activity increased, reaching a maximum at 48 h (1.9-fold) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the increased cAspAT activity was related to a physiological benefit (i.e. a decrease in FA output from adipocytes placed in a lipolytic situation), we measured the FA and glycerol contents of the culture medium of the cells that had been incubated for 1 h with 2 mm aspartate and 1 μm isoproterenol.Glycerol release has long been considered as a lipolytic index because of the very low glycerol kinase activity in adipocytes (5Vaughan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3354-3358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, its bioavailability was recently shown to be affected by TZD treatment in 3T3-F442A adipocytes (14Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Beale E.G. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18785-18790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in adipose tissue from lean human patients (15Leroyer S.N. Tordjman J. Chauvet G. Quette J. Chapron C. Forest C. Antoine B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13141-13149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, TZD is able to induce glycerol kinase gene expression (37Guan H.P. Li Y. Jensen M.V. Newgard C.B. Steppan C.M. Lazar M.A. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), thus allowing the use of glycerol for the re-esterification of FA at a ratio of 3 mol of FA to 1 mol of glycerol. Thus, in response to TZD treatment, two FA re-esterification pathways appear to co-exist in adipocytes: 1) the glycerol kinase-dependent path, which allows glycerol phosphorylation and does not modify the FA/glycerol lipolytic ratio, and 2) the glyceroneogenesis-dependent FA re-esterification path, which decreases this ratio because it affects only FA (14Tordjman J.

Fig. 1C illustrates such a decrease in the FA/glycerol ratio when aspartate was provided as a substrate for glyceroneogenesis. This decrease in FA release was time-dependent and inversely proportional to the increase in cAspAT activity generated by the rosiglitazone treatment. These data confirm that cAspAT is involved in the glyceroneogenic pathway by providing glycerol-3-P from aspartate to further re-esterify FA into triacylglycerol and that cAspAT, as well as PEPCK-C, is a potential target for TZD in adipocytes.TZD Induction of cAspAT Gene Expression Is Specific for Mature Adipocytes—To determine whether the increase in cAspAT enzyme activity following rosiglita"
https://openalex.org/W1965194070,"AMPA glutamate ion channels are tetrameric receptors in which activation to form the open channel depends on the binding of possibly multiple glutamate molecules. However, it is unclear whether AMPA receptors bound with a different number of glutamate molecules (i.e. one being the minimal and four being the maximal number of glutamate molecules) open the channels with different kinetic constants. Using a laser pulse photolysis technique that provides microsecond time resolution, we investigated the channel-opening kinetic mechanism of a nondesensitizing AMPA receptor, i.e. GluR1Qflip L497Y or a leucine-to-tyrosine substitution mutant, in the entire range of glutamate concentrations to ensure receptor saturation. We found that the minimal number of glutamate molecules required to bind to the receptor and to open the channel is two (or n = 2), and that the entire channel-opening kinetics can be adequately described by just one channel-opening rate constant, kop, which correlates to n = 2. This result suggests that higher receptor occupancy (n = 3 and 4) does not give rise to different kop values or, at least, not appreciably if the kop values are different. Furthermore, compared with the wild-type receptor (Li, G., and Niu, L. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 3990-3997), the channel-opening and channel-closing rate constants of the mutant are 1.5- and 13-fold smaller, respectively. Thus, the major effect of this mutation is to decrease the channel-closing rate constant by stabilizing the open channel conformation. AMPA glutamate ion channels are tetrameric receptors in which activation to form the open channel depends on the binding of possibly multiple glutamate molecules.

The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) 3The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; caged glutamate, γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate; HEK-293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells. 3The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid; caged glutamate, γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate; HEK-293 cells, human embryonic kidney cells. glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by binding of neurotransmitter glutamate (1Chen P.E. Wyllie D.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147: 839-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). An AMPA receptor is a tetrameric assembly with each subunit containing a glutamate binding site. The receptor can adopt multiple conductance levels, especially at high receptor occupancy, as observed in the single-channel records of wild-type and mutant recombinant receptors (3Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 4Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) as well as native AMPA receptors (5Smith T.C. Howe J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether receptor occupancy plays a significant role in determining the kinetic constants for an ensemble rate process of channel opening as a function of glutamate concentration. The ensemble rate process is manifested in a whole-cell current response to the binding of glutamate in vitro and best represents the glutamatergic synaptic activity in vivo, such as excitatory postsynaptic current. Therefore, determining the number of glutamate molecules bound to a receptor or the percentage of the receptor occupancy pertinent to the rate of the channel opening is a basic question to be answered for understanding the function of AMPA receptors. To address this question, we investigated the channel-opening kinetics for a GluR1 AMPA receptor channel carrying a substitution of leucine (L) to tyrosine (Y) or L497Y. The discovery of this point mutation by Stern-Bach et al. (3Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) was a significant event in understanding the structure and function relationship of AMPA receptors in that (a) phenomenologically, the single leucine-to-tyrosine substitution renders the homomeric receptor channels virtually non-desensitizing (3Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and (b) the phenotypic effect of this mutation is conserved at equivalent positions in all AMPA receptor subunits, i.e. GluR1-4 (6Sun Y.

Anesthesiology. 2004; 100: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this mutation is thought to have no effect on either the main conductance level or the channel opening probability (3Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F.

From a crystallographic study, Sun et al. (6Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar) revealed that this mutation resides in the receptor dimer interface of a tetrameric assembly and suggested that the rearrangement of the dimer interface is linked to receptor desensitization (6Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the lack of desensitization for the mutant is ascribable to this mutation that prevents the dimer interface movement. In the present study, we expressed GluR1Qflip L497Y mutant in HEK-293 cells and measured the channel-opening rate using a laser pulse photolysis technique and a photolabile precursor of glutamate or caged glutamate (γ-O-(α-carboxy-2-nitrobenzyl)glutamate). Photolysis of the caged glutamate liberates free glutamate with a t½ of ∼30 μs (10Wieboldt R. Gee K.R. Niu L. Ramesh D. Carpenter B.K. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8752-8756Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Using this technique we previously determined the rate constants of the channel opening for the wild-type GluR1Qflip receptor (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, comparison of the rate constants of the mutant with the wild-type receptor may reveal the effect of this mutation on the channel-opening process. What were the advantages in choosing this mutant for this study? First, because the mutant receptor was non-desensitizing, we could determine the concentration of photolytically released glutamate for kinetic analysis by directly calibrating the peak current amplitude observed in the laser pulse photolysis with the peak current amplitude observed in solution flow measurement with known glutamate concentrations. This direct calibration would not be possible in studying the wild-type receptor because of its rapid desensitization. Second, because the mutant channel had a higher affinity to glutamate or a lowered EC50 value (9Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jin R. Horning M. Mayer M.L. Gouaux E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15635-15643Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we were able to measure the observed channel-opening rate in the entire range of glutamate concentrations and thus determine the putative effect of different receptor occupancy on the channel-opening rate constant. Again, this was not possible in the study of the wild-type receptor (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The cDNA encoding the GluR1Qflip L497Y mutant receptor was kindly provided by Dr. Mark Fleck. The homomeric GluR1Qflip L497Y mutant was expressed in HEK-293 cells by transient transfection as described (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), except that Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was used. The weight ratio of the plasmid of GluR1Qflip L497Y to that of green fluorescent protein was 10:1, and 3-5 μg of GluR1Qflip L497Y cDNA was used in transfection. Green fluorescent protein was used as a transfection marker for recording. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were used for recording from 48 h after transfection. Whole-cell Recording and Laser Pulse Photolysis—The whole-cell recordings and the laser pulse photolysis measurements were at -60 mV and 22 °C, and the procedures were described previously (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the electrode had a resistance of ∼3 megohms when filled with electrode solution, which contained (in mm) 110 CsF, 30 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted by CsOH). The external solution contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). A U-tube device (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was used to apply glutamate to a cell, and the resulting rise time of the glutamate-induced whole-cell current response (10-90%) observed was ∼2 ms. The current traces were sampled at 5-50 kHz frequency and filtered at 2-20 kHz by an 8-pole Bessel filter. The data were acquired using pCLAMP 8 (Axon Instruments). In the laser pulse photolysis measurements, the caged glutamate (Invitrogen) was photolyzed using a 355 nm laser pulse from a Minilite II pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (Continuum). To determine the concentration of photolytically released glutamate, at least two free glutamate solutions with known concentrations were applied to a cell to calibrate the current amplitudes from the same cell before and after a laser photolysis. The current amplitudes obtained from known glutamate concentrations were compared with the amplitude evoked by photolytically released glutamate (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Li G. Pei W. Niu L.

Data Analysis—Based on the kinetic mechanism of channel opening (Fig. 1), the observed rate constant, kobs, of the whole-cell current rise in response to glutamate is given by Equation 1. Kobs=kcl+kop(LL+K1)n1 All other terms are defined in the Fig. 1 legend. In deriving Equation 1, the rate of ligand binding was assumed to be fast relative to the rate of channel opening. This assumption was supported by the consistent observation of a single first-order rate, in Equation 2, for the whole-cell current rise in the entire range of glutamate concentrations (see Fig. 2 results), It=IA(1−e−kobst)2 where It and IA represent the whole-cell current amplitude at time t and the maximum current amplitude. Using Equation 2, the kobs at a given glutamate concentration was calculated. A set of kcl and kop as well as K1 corresponding to a particular number of ligand(s) bound, i.e. n = 1-4 (see Fig. 1 legend), was obtained using Equation 1. As an independent measure, K1 was estimated from the dose-response relationship, shown in Equation 3, based on the general mechanism of channel opening (Fig. 1). IA=IMRMLnLn+Φ(L+K1)n3 FIGURE 2Laser pulse photolysis measurements of the channel-opening kinetics for GluR1Qflip L497Y mutant.

B, representative whole-cell current from the opening of the GluR1Qflip L497Y channel initiated by the laser pulse photolysis of caged glutamate. The laser was triggered at time zero. The fitting of the current rise to obtain the kobs using Equation 2 is shown as a solid line. For clarity of the presentation, the number of data points was reduced in the rising phase of the current. The kobs of 658 s-1 obtained from this trace corresponded to a glutamate concentration of 12 μm. The direction of the current response was plotted opposite to that recorded. C, nonlinear regression of kobs versus glutamate concentration relationship (solid line) according to Equation 1. The best nonlinear fitted parameters are: kop = (2.0 ± 1.0) × 104 s-1, kcl = 160 ± 91 s-1, K1 = 70 ± 41 μm, and n = 2.0 ± 2.1 (R2 value of 0.951). If the n value was fixed at 2 and the K1 value at 70 μm, obtained from the rate measurement and the dose-response curve (see Fig. 3), the linear fit of the kobs versus glutamate concentration using Equation 1 yielded kop = (1.9 ± 0.1) × 104 s-1 and kcl = 140 ± 160 s-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Equation 3, IM is the current per mole of receptor, RM the number of moles of receptors on the cell surface, and Φ-1 the channel-opening equilibrium constant. Unless otherwise noted, at least triplicate sets of data from three cells were collected in all measurements. Linear regression and nonlinear fitting were performed using Origin 7 software (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Using the Φ value analysis based on the transition state theory (15Pandit A.D. Krantz B.A. Dothager R.S. Sosnick T.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 350: 83-104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2004; 101: 7976-7981Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we calculated the change of the free energy of the transition state for the mutant and the wild-type receptor using Equation 4. Φ=ΔΔGTS−CΔΔGO−C4 Here Φ is the ratio of change of free energy of activation for opening of the channel, ΔΔGTS-C, to the equilibrium free energy of channel opening, ΔΔGO-C. The ΔΔG values were calculated by Equation 5 using kop and kcl values for both the mutant and the wild-type receptors. ΔG=RT ln(κThk)5 In Equation 5, R is the gas constant, T the temperature in Kelvin scale, h the Planck’s constant, κ the Boltzmann constant, and k the rate constant. Channel-opening Kinetics for GluR1Qflip L497Y—A glutamate-induced, whole-cell current from the mutant channel exhibited a sustained current response, whereas the wild-type response showed rapid desensitization (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with the original observation by Stern-Bach et al. (3Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Only when the glutamate concentration approached saturation did the mutant channel desensitize. For instance, at 0.5 mm glutamate, a saturating concentration for the mutant, the desensitization rate constant was 25 s-1. In contrast, the wild-type GluR1Qflip homomeric receptor channel desensitizes rapidly, with a maximum rate constant of ∼300 s-1 (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Mosbacher J. Schoepfer R. Monyer H. Burnashev N. Seeburg P.H. Ruppersberg J.P.

A. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Using the laser pulse photolysis technique, we measured the channel-opening rate for the GluR1Qflip L497Y channel as a function of glutamate concentration. Photolysis of the caged glutamate led to a whole-cell current rise (Fig. 2B). At least 95% of the whole-cell current rise followed a single exponential rate process (i.e. Equation 2 under “Experimental Procedures”) and remained so in the entire range of glutamate concentrations, i.e. from 10 to 140 μm. The range of the glutamate concentration corresponded to 14-92% of the fraction of the open channel (see the dose-response curve in Fig. 3). That a monoexponential rate for channel opening was persistently observed throughout the entire range of glutamate concentrations supported the assumption that the rate of ligand binding was fast relative to the rate of channel opening. Therefore, the current rise reflected the channel opening (Fig. 2B). Based on this assumption and a general mechanism of channel opening (in Fig. 1), Equation 1 was derived in which kobs represented the rate of transition from the ALn state to its corresponding open state, ALn. Note that Equation 1 represents a general formulation of the rate law, taking into account all of the possible number of ligands that can bind to and open the channel, namely n = 1-4. The permitted values of n in integer are based on the notion that an AMPA receptor is a tetramer and each subunit contains one ligand binding site (7Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 20Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). The Minimal Number of Glutamate Molecules Bound to the Receptor to Open the Channel Is Two—The rate of channel opening as a function of glutamate concentration (Fig. 2C) was analyzed as described below. First, using Equation 1, we found that the best nonlinear fit returned the value of n, the number of glutamate molecules bound to open the channel, to be close to 2 (see the legend for Fig. 2C). Along with this analysis, we obtained a set of kcl, kop, and K1 as the best fit values for the channel-opening kinetic mechanism. From the same analysis, a kcl value of 160 ± 91 s-1 was obtained (Fig. 2 legend). This value agreed with the rate constant we observed at the lower end of the glutamate concentration range, namely kobs ≈ 200 s-1 (Fig. 2C). This was expected because, when L << K1, Equation 1 was reduced to kobs ≈ kcl suggesting that (a) the rate constant at a low glutamate concentration would reflect kcl, and (b) the value of kcl was independent of whatever might be the n value. Based on this reasoning, we further examined our regression analysis by fixing kcl (Table 1). In so doing, we reduced one variable, which enabled us to improve the regression analysis. Using various kcl values close to 160 s-1, we found that the fitted values of n continued to be tightly close to 2 (Table 1). These results were consistent with n = 2 being the best fit to our data in the entire range of glutamate concentrations.TABLE 1Summary of nonlinear fitkclakcl is fixednkopK1R2s–1s–1μm502.1 ± 0.1(2.0 ± 0.1) × 10467.4 ± 3.10.9601002.1 ± 0.1(1.9 ± 0.1) × 10468.6 ± 3.20.9561502.2 ± 0.1(2.0 ± 0.1) × 10469.4 ± 3.40.9482002.1 ± 0.1(2.1 ± 0.1) × 10472.8 ± 3.50.9332502.2 ± 0.1(2.1 ± 0.1) × 10469.6 ± 3.40.918a kcl is fixed Open table in a new tab The analysis described above also yielded a K1 of 70 ± 41 μm (see Fig. 2 legend). To independently verify this value, we determined the dose-response curve using the amplitude of the whole-cell current (Fig. 3). The regression analysis of the dose-response relationship using Equation 3 yielded the best fit of K1 to be 68 ± 38 μm (Fig. 3 legend), consistent with the value obtained from the rate measurement (Fig. 2C). We also noted that the value of kop was unchanged even when different kcl values were used in data analysis (Table 1); the same was true for K1. We then asked whether kop would change with different n values. The results show that kop remained invariant when n increased (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 1), presumably with a concomitant increase of glutamate concentration and receptor occupancy (5Smith T.C. Howe J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results (from Fig. 1C and Tables 1 and 2) suggest that it is sufficient to use kop and kcl at n = 2 to represent the channel-opening kinetics of the mutant channel in the entire range of glutamate concentrations. We thus favor an interpretation of kop = (1.9 ± 0.1) × 104 s-1 and kcl = 140 ± 160 s-1 at n = 2 as the representative values of the channel-opening and channel-closing rate constants (see Fig. 2 legend). We emphasize that statistical F-criteria could not completely deny other n, although our analysis did yield n = 2 as the best fit for the channel-opening kinetics (Table 2). However, n = 1 was rejected because a negative kcl value was returned from the data analysis (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 2Summary of nonlinear fit See supplemental Fig. 1 for the fitting.naThe value of n is fixedkclkopK1R2s–1s–1μm1–780 ± 455(2.5 ± 0.8) × 104238 ± 1240.9372159 ± 343(2.0 ± 0.3) × 10471 ± 170.9393554 ± 320(2.0 ± 0.3) × 10448 ± 100.9294543 ± 310(2.0 ± 0.3) × 10433 ± 6.00.929a The value of n is fixed Open table in a new tab It should be noted that the data analysis described above did not assume a biased number of glutamate molecule(s) bound to the receptor in order to open its channel. Furthermore, the experimental basis for these conclusions was from the study of the L497Y GluR1 mutant rather than the wild-type receptor, although the major conclusions from the study of the mutant described here and the wild-type receptor we reported earlier (11Li G.

The Channel-opening Rate Is Dominated by the Receptor Bound with Two Glutamate Molecules—Evidence from all of our experiments and data analysis was well corroborated and supported the argument that binding of two or more glutamate molecules per receptor, i.e. n = 2-4 but not n = 1, was all sufficient to open the channel, and kop remained essentially invariant among n = 2-4. If receptor complexes bound with more than two glutamate molecules have higher conductance levels, higher conductance levels associated with higher agonist occupancy do not give rise to different channel-opening rate constants as compared with kop at n = 2. One possible explanation is that open channel conformations in different receptor occupancy, or n = 2-4, are similar. In this case, once the receptor accepts the minimal number of agonist molecules (i.e. n = 2) so that a sufficient amount of energy can be harnessed from agonist binding to open the channel, a higher receptor occupancy may simply stabilize the open channel conformation to different extents (21Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the receptor complexes with higher occupancy could have kop values different from the value at n = 2. However, the fractions of these complexes in the overall receptor population that undergo the channel-opening reaction could not have been significant enough to alter kobs, despite the fact that we did not know at what concentration(s) higher receptor occupancy or higher conductance levels began to contribute to the whole-cell current. Previously, it has been proposed that AMPA receptors with two to four glutamate molecules bound enter desensitization at similar rates and recover from the desensitization with similar rates as well (22Robert A. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 847-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though an AMPA receptor can adopt higher conductance levels observed in single-channel recording when glutamate concentration increases (4Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 5Smith T.C. Howe J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 7Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), it has been hypothesized that glutamate may not be able to populate higher conductance levels of synaptic AMPA receptors in vivo (5Smith T.C. Howe J.R. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 992-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft is estimated to be no higher than 1 mm for more than a few hundred μs (23Clements J.D. Feltz A. Sahara Y. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 119-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Diamond J.S. Jahr C.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4672-4687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable that AMPA channels actually function as a receptor complex activated predominantly by the binding of two glutamate molecules. Obviously, it should be noted that the conclusion drawn from our study was based on a homomeric mutant channel rather than heteromeric native AMPA receptors in vivo. The binding of two glutamate molecules per receptor to open the channel is a plausible stoichiometry (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), if an AMPA receptor is considered a dimer of “dimers” (25Mayer M.L. Armstrong N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 161-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). As such, binding of one glutamate molecule per dimer or two per dimer of dimers is possible. Interestingly, two subunits acting as a dimer in a tetrameric receptor composition, undergoing a concerted transition between inactive and active states, was also proposed for intracellular cyclic GMP-gated channels (26Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Paoletti P. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 235-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), where the opening of the channels also depends on the receptor occupancy (26Liu D.T. Tibbs G.R. Paoletti P. Siegelbaum S.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 235-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Ruiz M.L. Karpen J.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 389-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The Major Effect of the L497Y Mutation on GluR1 is to Stabilize the Open Channel Conformation—Comparison of the channel-opening kinetic constants of the mutant with those of the wild-type GluR1Qflip receptor, which we characterized previously (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), shows that the kop and kcl for the mutant at n = 2 are ∼1.5- and ∼13-fold smaller than those for the wild-type receptor, respectively. Thus, the major effect of this point mutation is to decrease the channel-closing rate or to prolong the lifetime of the open channel (kcl = 1/τ, where τ is the lifetime expressed in time constant). As a result, the open channel state is stabilized. To better understand the effect of this mutation on stabilizing the open channel state, we applied the Φ value analysis to infer transition state structures from changes in kinetics on mutation, a procedure used in protein folding, catalysis, and conformational transitions (15Pandit A.D. Krantz B.A. Dothager R.S. Sosnick T.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 350: 83-104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17327-17328Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Fersht A.R. Sato S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7976-7981Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The value of Φ indicates the extent to which a mutated residue is involved in the formation of the transition state on a scale of 0 to 1 (i.e. 0 and 1 represent that the influence of the side chain is either absent or fully present in the transition state because of that mutation). Using Equation 4, we estimated Φ= 0.16 (Fig. 4). A fractional value of Φ suggests that upon mutation, the site near L497Y was not entirely wild type-like. Instead, the local environment near tyrosine 497 has changed somewhat due to the mutation, as compared with the leucine residue at the same position in the wild-type receptor. This single amino acid substitution further affected the transition state (i.e. ΔΔGTS-C = 0.21 kcal/mol; see the legend for Fig. 4). Thus, this analysis suggests that the major effect of the L497Y mutation in GluR1 is to stabilize the channel-opening state (by an amount of ΔΔG = 1.3 kcal/mol; see Fig. 4). This is consistent with the structural revelation by which the same mutation stabilizes the dimer interface of the S1S2 mutant receptor (6Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). However, the L497Y mutation further causes a non-native, structural change near the mutation site in the closed channel state, inferred from the non-zero Φ value. This change may be linked to a reduction of the K1 or EC50 value for glutamate in the mutant (9Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Partin K.M. Fleck M.W. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6634-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although how the structural change due to this point mutation affects glutamate binding affinity is not clear. Implications Based on the Kinetic Constants and Free Energy Diagram—Based on the results of this study, including the free energy diagram (Fig. 4), we predict that a change of the free energy of the open channel state compared with that of the wild-type receptor, the benchmark, affects the stability of the open channel state and thus alters the channel-closing rate constant and vice versa. For instance, the kcl of the L497Y mutant is smaller than that of the wild type, suggesting that this structural modification lowers the energy level of the open channel state by stabilizing it. In contrast, our study of the alternatively spliced variants of GluR3 or GluR3 flip and GluR3 flop shows that the flop isoform has a larger kcl than the flip isoform, presumably reflecting that the flop isoform destabilizes the channel-open state (29Pei W. Huang Z. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By the same prediction, any mutation or change of structure (whether it is located in the dimer interface, such as the mutation in GluR2, but is equivalent to the L497Y in GluR1 (6Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), or elsewhere but nevertheless stabilizes the open channel state) would slow the rate of channel closing. If a mutation does not affect the stability of the open channel conformation, that mutation is expected not to affect the channel-closing rate constant and vice versa. Therefore, the assessment of the effect of a mutation on kcl provides a measure of whether the mutation exerts any structural impact on stability of the open channel conformation. Relationship between Channel Closing and Desensitization—As compared with the GluR1Qflip wild-type receptor (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), both the channel-closing rate and the desensitization rate of the L497Y mutant are decreased. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that desensitization begins from the closed channel state, as proposed previously (30Clements J.D. Lester R.A. Tong G. Jahr C.E. Westbrook G.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1498-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 31Raman I.M. Trussell L.O. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but not from the open channel state. Furthermore, the channel-closing rate process kinetically controls the channel desensitization, provided that both reactions occur, such as when n = 2-4. By this notion, desensitization begins in parallel to the channel-opening reaction once glutamate is bound but proceeds from the closed channel state and with a slower rate. In fact, in this and all other studies of AMPA receptor channels, we have found that the rate of channel closing is markedly faster than the rate of the channel desensitization (11Li G. Niu L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3990-3997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Li G. Pei W. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12358-12366Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14Li G. Sheng Z. Huang Z. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5835-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Pei W. Huang Z. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The common “species” that links the two reactions is the closed channel state, although it is unclear which closed channel form(s) enters the desensitization pathway. As shown in this study, a higher concentration of the open channel state for the L497Y mutant, which correlates to a longer lifetime or more stable open channel conformation, actually “inhibited” a speedy return of the channel to the closed channel state and thus a speedy entry to the desensitization state (see Fig. 1A) compared with the wild type. If the desensitization could have started from the open channel state, a higher concentration of the open channel state would have resulted in a faster desensitization rate than the wild type. Indeed, this hypothesis is consistent with previous observations that desensitization is agonist-promoted (32Tang C.M. Dichter M. Morad M. Science. 1989; 243: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and that the L497Y mutant channels can desensitize, albeit very slowly and only at very high concentrations of ligand, as observed by us and others (6Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 9Robert A. Irizarry S.N. Hughes T.E. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5574-5586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, that the rate of the channel closing controls the rate of desensitization is supported by our results with the GluR3 receptors in that the kcl of the GluR3 flop variant is ∼4-fold larger than that of the flip isoform, and the flop isoform desensitizes ∼4-fold faster than the flip isoform (29Pei W. Huang Z. Niu L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2027-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, for the flip and flop isoforms of GluR1, the kcl of both isoforms is identical, within experimental errors, and as expected, the channel desensitization rate constant is also no different. 4W. Pei and L. Niu, unpublished data. Further studies are obviously needed to test our predictions and hypothesis. It should be noted that the underlying assumption in our hypothesis described above is that the control of the desensitization through the channel-closing rate step requires the channel to open in the first place. An exception to our hypothesis is that at a glutamate concentration much lower than required for activation, so that a channel cannot open, desensitization can still occur (22Robert A. Howe J.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 847-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Trussell L.O. Thio L.L. Zorumski C.F. Fischbach G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this case, the kinetic control mechanism using the rapid channel-opening reaction to regulate the concentration of the ligand-bound, closed channel state through which the channel desensitizes simply does not exist.

https://openalex.org/W1986039772,"DNA repair is known as a defense mechanism against genotoxic insults. However, the most lethal type of DNA damages, double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), can be produced by DNA repair. We have previously demonstrated that when long patch base excision repair attempts to repair a synthetic substrate containing two uracils, the repair produces DSBs (Vispe, S. and Satoh, M. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 27386-27392 and Vispe, S., Ho, E. L., Yung, T. M., and Satoh, M. S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 35279-35285). In this synthetic substrate, the two uracils are located on the opposite DNA strands (separated by an intervening sequence stable at 37 °C) and represent a high risk site for DSB formation. It is not clear, however, whether similar high risk sites are also induced in genomic DNA by exposure to DNA damaging agents. Thus, to investigate the mechanisms of DSB formation, we have modified the DSB formation assay developed previously and demonstrated that high risk sites for DSB formation are indeed generated in genomic DNA by exposure of cells to alkylating agents. In fact, genomic DNA containing alkylated base damages, which could represent high risk sites, are converted into DSBs by enzymes present in extracts prepared from cells derived from clinically normal individuals. Furthermore, DSBs are also produced by extracts from cells derived from ataxia-telangiectasia patients who show cancer proneness due to an impaired response to DSBs. These results suggest the presence of a novel link between base damage formation and DSBs and between long patch base excision repair and human diseases that occur due to an impaired response to DSB.

It has been demonstrated that the most lethal type of DNA damages, double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand DNA breaks; SSB, single-strand DNA break; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic site; AT, ataxia-telangiectasia; ATM, AT mutated protein; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1; BER, base excision repair (BER); MNNG, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; pBS, pBluscript KS II+; endo III, endonuclease III; Gy, gray; BPDE, benzo[α]pyren-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide.3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand DNA breaks; SSB, single-strand DNA break; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic site; AT, ataxia-telangiectasia; ATM, AT mutated protein; FEN-1, flap endonuclease-1; BER, base excision repair (BER); MNNG, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; pBS, pBluscript KS II+; endo III, endonuclease III; Gy, gray; BPDE, benzo[α]pyren-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide. are produced by exposure of DNA to γ- or x-rays (1Sonntag C.V.

These forms of ionizing radiations generate radical pairs by depositing their energy on water molecules (2Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). These pairs then lead to the formation of multiple damages, including oxidized bases and single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs), within a short stretch of DNA (2Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). These multiple damages or “closely spaced” damages compose DNA damage clusters (2Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Within the clusters, if two “closely spaced” SSBs are produced on opposite DNA strands, DNA is spontaneously denatured, leading to DSB formation (1Sonntag C.V. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis Ltd., London1989Google Scholar). Similarly, when two “closely spaced” oxidized base damages located on opposite DNA strands are removed by DNA glycosylases, SSBs are produced through the incision of the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites by AP-endonuclease (3Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar). These SSBs can then be converted into a DSB (4Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Biol.

Although the Tm value of the intervening sequence between two SSBs or oxidized base damages is required to be below 37 °C to allow spontaneous denaturation of the sequence, “closely spaced” damage formation within a DNA damage cluster plays a critical role in the formation of radiation-induced DSBs. Although radiation-induced DSBs are cytotoxic, the majority of cells have the ability to respond to DSBs by activating a pathway initiated by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM); this pathway eventually regulates DSB repair and cell cycle (8Lavin M.F. Delia D. Chessa L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). An abnormality in this pathway, thus, causes hypersensitivity of cells to γ- and x-rays (10Taylor A.M. Harnden D.G. Arlett C.F. Harcourt S.A. Lehmann A.R. Stevens S. Bridges B.A. Nature. 1975; 258: 427-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In fact, cells derived from homozygotes of a human autosomal recessive disorder, ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), and AT patients are extremely sensitive to ionizing radiations due to the impaired function of ATM (8Lavin M.F. Delia D. Chessa L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar, 10Taylor A.M.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Such hypersensitivity is, however, not the only characteristic of AT patients, as they also exhibit various other clinical symptoms, including immune deficiency and progressive neuronal degeneration (11Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 12Khanna K. Gatti R. Concannon P. Weemaes C. Hoekstra M. Lavin M. D'Andrea A. Nickloff J. Hoekstra M.

In addition, AT homozygotes frequently develop lymphoid-type malignancies (14Hecht F. Hecht B.K. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1990; 46: 9-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Morrell D. Chase C.L. Swift M. Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1990; 50: 119-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that AT heterozygotes also develop cancer, although in the form of breast cancer (13Khanna K.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Easton D.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1994; 66: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 17Swift M. Morrell D.

Med. 1987; 316: 1289-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These symptoms appear to develop in the absence of obvious exposure to ionizing radiations, suggesting that DSBs are produced in cells under physiological conditions (19Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these DSBs are created from other forms of DNA damages induced by reactive oxygen metabolites or other DNA damaging agents (19Mills K.D. Ferguson D.O. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 194: 77-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), although the majority of endogenous metabolites or agents do not frequently induce “closely spaced” damages. Thus, it has been assumed that DSBs can be produced through alternative mechanisms that are yet to be understood. If “closely spaced” damages are defined as damages produced on opposite DNA strands and separated by an intervening sequence that can be denatured at 37 °C, “spaced” damages can be defined as damages produced on opposite DNA strands and separated by an intervening sequence that has a Tm value above 37 °C (Fig. 1A). Because “spaced” damages can be induced by various DNA damaging agents, we have previously developed a cell-free DSB formation assay using a synthetic substrate containing “spaced” uracils to investigate the mechanisms of DSB formation (Fig. 1B) (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uracil was selected to construct “spaced” base damages, as synthetic oligonucleic acid-containing uracils is commercially available. In addition, extracts were prepared from DNA ligase I mutant cells (46BR) (22Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster A.D. Lindahl T. Cell. 1992; 69: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which predominantly produce long repair patches at the sites of base damages (23Prigent C. Satoh M.S. Daly G. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and from normal fibroblast, MRC5 cells (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay the “spaced” uracils, one of which is located on the 3′ side of the other on opposite DNA strands and both of which are separated by an 18- or 30-bp intervening sequence (Tm values of intervening sequences are 62 and 75 °C, respectively), are converted into a DSB by extracts prepared from 46BR cells (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conversion is initiated through removal of uracils by uracil DNA glycosylase followed by incision at resulting AP sites by AP endonuclease (3Lindahl T.

Then flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), which is known to play a role in long patch base excision repair (BER) by removing DNA strands at SSBs in the 5′ to 3′ direction (24Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Price A. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), cleaves the DNA strands facing each other starting from the SSBs produced at the uracils sites (Fig. 1B). The Tm value of the intervening sequence between the two SSBs is eventually reduced, resulting in DNA strand denaturation and DSB formation (26Vispe S. Ho E.L. Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35279-35285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although 46BR cell extracts were required to be used or excess amounts of FEN-1 were needed to be added to assays with extracts prepared from normal fibroblasts, MRC5, to experimentally detect DSB formation (26Vispe S. Ho E.L. Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35279-35285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), these results suggest that repair of “spaced” uracils by long patch BER introduces a risk of DSB formation. Although “spaced” uracils represent high risk sites for DSB formation, it is not known whether similar high risk sites are produced by exposure of DNA, particularly genomic DNA, to DNA damaging agents, which unlike ionizing radiations, do not produce DNA damage clusters. In the present work, to elucidate the mechanism of DSB formation, the occurrence of DSB formation resulting from the conversion of “spaced” alkylated base damages, which were induced by N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), was investigated using a cell-free DSB formation assay with extracts prepared from cells derived from clinically normal individuals. In addition, as the formation of DSBs in AT heterozygotes and homozygotes causes cancer development (8Lavin M.F. Delia D. Chessa L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 9Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar), extracts prepared from cells derived from AT heterozygotes and homozygotes were also used to determine whether “spaced” base damages could act as a risk factors for ATM gene mutation carriers. Cells and Cell Extract Preparation—Lymphoblastoid cell lines, GM00621 (clinically normal), GM01953 (clinically normal), GM06351 (clinically normal), GM03334 (AT heterozygote), GM09588 (AT heterozygote), GM09585 (AT heterozygote), GM02782 (AT homozygote), and GM03189 (AT homozygote), were purchased from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). Cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (26Vispe S. Ho E.L. Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35279-35285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Lindahl T. J. Biol.

Preparation of P2U18 and pBluscript KS II+ (pBS), Exposed to Either MNNG or γ-Rays—P2U18 was constructed, and pBS was exposed to either 400 μm MNNG or 50 Gy of γ-rays (137Cs source, dose rate 1 Gy/min, Gamma Cell 40 Exactor, MDS Nordion) as described previously (26Vispe S.

Covalently closed circular DNA was purified by CsCl-ethidium bromide (EtBr) centrifugation and stored in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer). Formation of DNA damage by the treatment with MNNG or the exposure to γ-rays resulted in the conversion of about 40% of covalently closed circular pBS into the open circular form by endonuclease III (endo III) treatment. DSB Formation Assay—DSB formation assays with 200 ng of P2U18, MNNG-treated pBS, or γ-ray-irradiated pBS were carried out as described (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 50 μg of extracts proteins in a 50-μl reaction mixture for 1 h at 30 °C. After termination of cell-free DSB formation reaction and DNA purification, plasmids were fractionated on a 1% agarose-EtBr gel. DNA was visualized by UV. To determine the amount of linearized DNA, images were created using AlphaImager (Alpha Innotech Corp.), and DNA was quantified with Chemilmager 4000 (Alpha Innotech). Standard errors, which were determined from 6 independent experiments, were typically 25%. PCR and Sequencing of P2U18—After fractionation of P2U18 by 1% agarose-EtBr gel electrophoresis, linearized P2U18 was extracted. Then linear P2U18 (5 μg/μl) was methylated by 0.6 units/μl of HaeIII methylase for 1 h at 37 °C. In some cases HaeIII-treated P2U18 (8 μg/μl) was incubated with 0.0005 units/μl of Klenow fragment for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA. These linearized P2U18 (16 ng/μl) were mixed with 0.05 pmol/μl of BE fragment, which was prepared by annealing of AdF (5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGGACTTATCCGG-3′) and AdR (5′-pCCGGATAAGTCCTCGACTGTGCCTTCTAAAAAA-3), and incubated with 0.5 units/μl of T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 16 °C. After heat inactivation of T4 DNA ligase, DNA was incubated with 0.5 units/μl of HaeIII for 30 min at 37 °C to digest dimerized BE fragments. Then 80 ng of linearized P2U18 was used for PCR with 80 pmol of BE primer and either Pr-Reverse primer (5′-GTCGGGTTTCGCCACCTCTGACTTGAGCGT-3′) or Pr-Forward primer (5′-CACGCTGCGCGTAACCACCACACCCGCCGCGCTTAATGCGCCGCTAC-3′) in 100 μl of ThermoPol reaction buffer (New England Biolabs) containing 200 μm each of dNTPs, 20% of betaine, and 2 units of vent DNA polymerase. Amplification reaction (30 cycles) was performed with 1 min denaturation at 96 °C, 1 min annealing at 65 °C, and either a 20-s extension for Pr-Reverse primer or 40 s for Pr-Forward primer at 72 °C. Amplified products were fractionated by 1% agarose-EtBr gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV. Alternatively, amplified products were cloned into pCRR Blunt II TOPO using Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen), and Escherichia coli Top 10 was transformed using this plasmid. The cloned plasmid was used for sequencing with either M13 reverse or T7 primers. Sequencing of Re-circularized P2U18—Linearized P2U18 (100 ng), extracted from 1% agarose-EtBr gel, was re-circularized using Quick Ligation kit (New England Biolabs). Then DNA was used for transformation of E. coli DH5α. Extracted P2U18 from cloned E. coli was used for DNA sequencing with M13 reverse and forward primers. Heat Denaturation Assay with MNNG-treated and γ-Rayirradiated pBS—MNNG-treated or γ-ray-irradiated pBS (25 ng/μl) was incubated with 0.1 units/μl of endo III for 30 min at 37 °C. Then reaction mixtures were incubated at either 37, 50, 60, or 80 °C for 5 min followed by chilling on ice. Incubated DNA was fractionated on a 1% agarose-EtBr gel and visualized by UV. Preparation of Hybrid-pBS—Non-damaged pBS (1 μg/μl) was digested with 2 units/μl SmaI for 1 h at 25 °C. MNNG-treated and γ-ray-irradiated pBS (1 μg/μl) was cleaved by 2 units/μl EcoRV for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, cleaved non-damaged pBS and either MNNG-treated or γ-ray-irradiated pBS were mixed and incubated at 96 °C for 5 min. After gradual cooling of the reaction mixture to allow annealing of denatured DNA strands, the mixture containing 500 μg of DNA was incubated with 1250 units of T4 DNA ligase in a 500-ml reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 12 h at 16 °C. By annealing of a non-damaged DNA strand with a damaged strand, single-strand tails were created at both ends (Fig. 5A), and this ligation reaction allowed the circularization of this hybrid-pBS through these tails. The ligation reaction mixture was then concentrated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 4 h in a SW55 rotor and covalently closedcircular hybrid-pBS was purified by CsCl-EtBr centrifugation. The resulting DNA was stored in TE buffer. Exposure of Cells to Either MNNG or γ-Rays and Preparation of Circularized Genomic DNA—HeLa S3 cells were exposed to either 2 or 10 Gy of γ-rays (137Cs source; dose rate, 1 Gy/min) on ice. Alternatively, HeLa S3 cells were treated with either 10 or 50 μm MNNG in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 15 min and placed on ice. After harvesting cells through scraping, cells were lysed using a buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. DNA was purified by chloroform-phenol extractions, precipitated by ethanol, and treated with 0.03 mg/ml RNase A in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C. Extracted genomic DNA (0.1 μg/μl) was digested with 0.3 units/μl of SpeI, 0.3 units/μl of NheI, and 0.6 units/μl of XbaI to create CTAG-5′ protruding ends for 2 h at 37 °C. Genomic DNA (100 μg) was circularized in a 100-ml ligation reaction and purified by CsCl-EtBr centrifugation as described under “Preparation of hybrid-pBS.” The resulting DNA was stored in TE buffer. DSB Formation Assay with Circularized Genomic DNA—DSB formation reaction was carried out with 200 ng of circularized genomic DNA and 50 μg of protein extracts as described (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After termination of the reaction and purification of DNA, 0.2 units/μl of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was incubated with the DNA (8 μg/μl) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, after ethanol precipitation of DNA (200 ng), duplex oligonucleic acid prepared by annealing of AdF4 (5′-TAGAAGGCACAGTCGAGGACTTATCACGCATGTTAGTGCCACTACCGdideoxyC-3′) and AdR4 (5′-pGCGGTAGTGGCACTAACATGCGTGATAAGTCCTCGACTGTGCCTTCTAAAAdideoxy[32P]A-3′) was ligated to DSB ends by 5 units of T4 DNA ligase in a 10-μl of reaction mixture containing 33 μm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 15% of polyethylene glycol 8000 (28Pheiffer B.H. Zimmerman S.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7853-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) at 20 °C for overnight. The ligation mixture was then fractionated on a 1% agarose-EtBr gel containing a 5% agarose layer as illustrated in Fig. 6E. DNA was visualized using UV. Alternatively, the gel was dried and then exposed to an x-ray film for autoradiography. Endo III-Endo IV Treatment of Circularized Genomic DNA—Circularized genomic DNA (250 ng) or pBS (250 ng) exposed to either MNNG or γ-rays were treated with 2 units of endo III in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37 °C. After DNA ethanol precipitation, DNA was treated with 2 units of endo IV in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, 40 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was added and incubated at 80 °C for 5 min. After the addition of 50 μl of preheated 2× ThermoPol reaction buffer containing 200 μm each of dNTPs at 80 °C, 1 unit of vent DNA polymerase was added. The temperature was then shifted to 72 °C and incubated for 1 min. After purification of DNA by Nucleospin Extract II kit, DNA was treated with alkaline phosphatase, labeled with 32P, and fractionated on agarose gel as described under “DSB formation assay with circularized genomic DNA.” DSB Formation Assay with P2U18—We have previously developed a cell-free DSB formation assay using model substrates, circular DNAs containing two uracils separated by intervening sequences (Fig. 1B) (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the model substrates, P2U18, contains the intervening sequence with a Tm value of 65 °C. Thus, SSBs produced at the uracils sites do not lead to denaturation of DNA at 37 °C (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Tm value of the intervening sequence is, however, reduced by a FEN-1-mediated 5′ to 3′ DNA strand cleavage that initiates from these SSBs, leading to DNA strand denaturation and DSB formation (26Vispe S. Ho E.L. Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35279-35285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). This cleavage can be efficiently counteracted by DNA ligase I (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to experimentally detect DSB formation, we previously used extracts prepared from DNA ligase I mutant cells, 46BR (22Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster A.D. Lindahl T. Cell. 1992; 69: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), or added an excess of purified FEN-1 to the DSB formation assays (21Vispe S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vispe S. Ho E.L. Yung T.M. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35279-35285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present work we performed our study without the addition of FEN-1. Thus, we first characterized DSBs produced by extracts prepared from cells derived from clinically normal individuals, AT heterozygotes, and homozygotes using our cell-free DSB formation assay with P2U18. As shown in Fig. 1C, about 6-16% of P2U18 were converted into linear P2U18, whereas 0-8% of non-damaged pBS were linearized, suggesting that DSBs are more frequently produced in P2U18 when compared with pBS by extracts prepared from various cells. Formation of a DSB between Two Uracil Residues—To examine whether DSBs are produced at uracils sites, we performed PCR analysis. After extraction of linearized P2U18 from agarose-EtBr gels, duplex oligonucleic acid (BE fragment), which contained a primer binding site for PCR, was ligated to DSB ends (Fig. 2A). PCR was then performed with a primer for BE (BE primer) and either with Pr-Forward or Pr-Reverse primers. These primers, in the case of DSBs generated between two uracil residues, were expected to produce PCR products of about 380 (U1 side of DSB) and 560 (U2 side of DSB) bp in length (Fig. 2A). In fact, we detected DNA fragments of the expected lengths when linearized P2U18 produced by extracts prepared from cells derived from clinically normal (GM06315 and GM00621), AT heterozygotes (GM09588 and GM09585), and AT homozygote (GM03189) were used (Fig. 2B). As a control, pBS linearized by GM09588 extract (see Fig. 1C) was also used for PCR analysis. After PCR amplification, however, no discrete bands were produced (Fig. 2B, pBS). Thus, results suggest that amplified DNA fragments found in assays with linearized P2U18 were generated due to the formation of DSB within a region of P2U18 containing two uracils. Mapping of DSB Ends—To further characterize DSBs produced by extracts prepared from various cells, DSB ends were mapped (Fig. 2C). Amplified DNA fragments (Fig. 2B) were, thus, cloned into a pCRR Blunt II Topo vector, and recombinant plasmids extracted from cloned E. coli were used for sequencing. As summarized in Fig. 2C, the U1 side of DSB ends was mapped between two uracil residues. Mapping showed that ATAT sequences located within an intervening sequence were a preferential DSB formation site. Furthermore, the U2 side of DSB ends was also mapped between the two uracils residues. Although some DSB ends were found outside of the two uracils, possibly due to the processing of DNA ends by nucleases, these results reveal that DSB ends were frequently produced at uracils sites. As an alternative approach to characterize DSBs, linearized P2U18 produced by GM00621 (normal) and GM09585 (AT heterozygote) extracts were re-circularized (Fig. 3A) and used for sequencing analysis. Through this analysis, we found 1-3 base deletions which were likely generated upon DSB formation, in the intervening sequences and at the uracils sites (Fig. 3B). Of note, to create a one-base deletion at the uracils site, DNA polymerization and DNA cleavage are required to occur in a coordinated manner either during the denaturation process of the intervening sequence or through the processing of DSB ends. Thus, in addition to FEN-1, other factors may be involved in the process of DSB formation. Nevertheless, these results suggest that DSBs are predominantly produced in the region of P2U18 containing the two uracils by cell-free extracts prepared from either normal, AT heterozygote, or homozygote cells even without any addition of purified FEN-1. Conversion of Alkylated Base Damages into DSBs—Next, we have investigated whether “spaced” damages, which can represent potential sites for DSB formation, were produced by exposure of DNA to an alkylating agent. pBS was, thus, exposed to MNNG to produce alkylated base damages, and the resulting MNNG-treated pBS was incubated with endo III, which induces DNA nicks at the site of modified thymidines (29Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, lanes 7 versus 8, MNNG-treated pBS (super-coiled) was converted to the open-circular form"
https://openalex.org/W2006521844,"The crystal structure of the Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (EcoDam) in a binary complex with the cofactor product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) unexpectedly showed the bound AdoHcy in two alternative conformations, extended or folded. The extended conformation represents the catalytically competent conformation, identical to that of EcoDam-DNA-AdoHcy ternary complex. The folded conformation prevents catalysis, because the homocysteine moiety occupies the target Ade binding pocket. The largest difference between the binary and ternary structures is in the conformation of the N-terminal hexapeptide (9KWAGGK14). Cofactor binding leads to a strong change in the fluorescence of Trp10, whose indole ring approaches the cofactor by 3.3Å. Stopped-flow kinetics and AdoMet cross-linking studies indicate that the cofactor prefers binding to the enzyme after preincubation with DNA. In the presence of DNA, AdoMet binding is ∼2-fold stronger than AdoHcy binding. In the binary complex the side chain of Lys14 is disordered, whereas Lys14 stabilizes the active site in the ternary complex. Fluorescence stopped-flow experiments indicate that Lys14 is important for EcoDam binding of the extrahelical target base into the active site pocket. This suggests that the hexapeptide couples specific DNA binding (Lys9), AdoMet binding (Trp10), and insertion of the flipped target base into the active site pocket (Lys14).

Although most prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases (MTases) 4The abbreviations used are: MTase, methyltransferase; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; EcoDam, E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PDB, Protein Data Bank; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; 2AP, 2-aminopurine. are components of restriction-modification systems and function as part of a host defense mechanism, some MTases are not associated with a restriction enzyme, e.g. the Escherichia coli DNA adenine MTase (EcoDam), which methylates the exocyclic amino nitrogen (N6) of the Ade in GATC (1Lacks S.

Biol. 1978; 126: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DNA-adenine methylation at specific GATC sites plays a pivotal role in the regulation of bacterial gene expression and DNA replication, mismatch repair, and is essential for bacterial virulence for many Gram-negative bacteria (3Lobner-Olesen A. Skovgaard O. Marinus M.G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Like other DNA MTases, EcoDam catalyzes methyl group transfer from the donor AdoMet, AdoHcy, and methylated DNA. Recently, we have described a ternary structure of EcoDam complexed to specific DNA in the presence of AdoHcy (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Eco-Dam contains two domains as follows: a seven-stranded catalytic domain that harbors the binding site for AdoHcy and a DNA binding domain consisting of a five-helix bundle and a β-hairpin loop that is conserved in the family of GATC-related MTase orthologs. In the ternary complex, a single bound AdoHcy exhibits an extended conformation similar to that described for many DNA MTases, including bacteriophage T4 Dam (5Cheng X. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4369-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggested that AdoMet could bind to EcoDam in two different environments or there are two AdoMet-binding sites in EcoDam (11Bergerat A. Guschlbauer W. Fazakerley G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6394-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that there is communication between the cofactor-binding site and the active site (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol.

The structure of the binary EcoDam-AdoHcy complex reported here suggests that Lys14 is essential in this coupling, a conclusion that is supported by biochemical evidence as well. Furthermore, the binary structure shows the bound AdoHcy in either of two alternative but significantly different conformations (extended or folded). The adenine and the ribose ring of AdoHcy occupy the same position in both conformations, whereas the methionine moiety in the folded conformation occupies the target Ade binding pocket in the active site. Although different conformations of bound AdoMet or AdoHcy have been observed in the five MTase structural classes (13Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem.

Because we observe that residues close to the N terminus of EcoDam are involved in AdoMet binding (Trp10 in this work) and recognition of Gua1 (Lys9 in Ref. 4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we cloned EcoDam with C-terminal His tag and purified the protein. Comparison of the Km values for AdoMet and the relative methylation of substrates, which carry a nucleotide exchange at position Gua1, showed that the N-terminal His tag did not interfere with AdoMet binding and Gua1 recognition (data not shown). Crystallography—Concentrated binary complexes were mixed with a 12-bp oligonucleotide duplex (synthesized by the New England Biolabs, Inc) at a protein to DNA ratio of ∼2:1 and allowed to stand on ice for at least two h before crystallization; final protein concentration for crystallization trials was ∼15 mg/ml. Small hexagonal crystals (<50 μm) were observed under high salt conditions of ∼1.2-1.6 m NH4/Li(SO4)2, 50 mm MgSO4, 100 mm buffer (MES or HEPES) (pH 6.8-7.2). Attempts to obtain crystals of the EcoDam-cofactor binary complex in the absence of DNA resulted in small particles unsuitable for x-ray crystallographic study. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the program REPLACE (19Tong L. Rossmann M.G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 594-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), using an EcoDam protomer from the refined ternary complex structure (PDB 2G1P) as a search model. Although the oligonucleotides were present, the high salt crystal form only contains three binary complexes of EcoDam-AdoHcy. During the refinement, using the program CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16991) Google Scholar), the 3-fold noncrystallographic restraints were imposed at the earlier stage of refinement and were released at the later cycles to account for different interaction environments of crystal packing with each molecule (Table 1). The two AdoHcy conformations in molecules β and γ were refined with equal occupancy (50%), resulting in similar crystallographic temperature factors (in the range of ∼30 Å2). The folded AdoHcy conformation in molecule α was refined in 90% occupancy.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsCrystalaCrystals, acquired with a nylon loop (Hampton), were quickly transferred to mother liquor containing either 25% glycerol or ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen or in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K.EcoDam-AdoHcyPDB code2OREBeamline (wavelength Å)APS 22-ID (0.97923)Space groupP3121Unit cell dimensions (Å)160.1, 160.1, 94.0and angles (°)90, 90, 120Resolution Range (Å) (highest resolution shell)34.67 to 2.99 (3.1 to 2.99)Measured reflections129,223Unique reflections28,125<I/σ>9.2Completeness (%)99.5 (100.0)Rlinear = ∑|I- 〈I 〉|/∑ 〈I 〉0.111 (0.505)Rfactor = ∑|Fo-Fc|/∑|Fc|0.202 (0.317)R-free (5% data)0.235 (0.330)Non-hydrogen atomsProtein5856 (3 EcoDam)DNAHeterogen83 (3 AdoHcy)Water8Root-mean-square deviation from idealityBond lengths (Å)0.008Bond angles (°)1.3Dihedral (°)22.2Improper (°)0.9Estimated coordinate errorfrom Luzzati plot (Å)0.35from Sigma (Å)0.33a Crystals, acquired with a nylon loop (Hampton), were quickly transferred to mother liquor containing either 25% glycerol or ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen directly in liquid nitrogen or in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Open table in a new tab DNA Methylation Studies—Oligonucleotide substrates were purchased from Thermo Electron (Dreieich, Germany) in the purified form. Methylation experiments were performed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin containing 3.6 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C as described (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X.

Chem. 2000; 381: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using 1 μm 20-bp oligonucleotide and 0.25 μm enzyme. The 20-bp oligonucleotide containing one GATC target site was a duplex of 5′-GC GAC AGT GATC GGC CTG TC-3′ and 5′-GA CAG GCC GMTC ACT GTC GC-3′, where M is N6-methyl-Ade. Methylation experiments were repeated at least three times. The data shown are an average of all experiments. For analysis, the data were fitted to a curve describing a single exponential followed by a linear phase as shown in Equation 1, c(product)=B+F×(1−exp(−k1t))+k2t where k1 is the rate constant of the exponential phase; F is amplitude of the exponential phase; k2 is the rate constant of the linear phase; and B is experimental background. For error analysis the experiments were analyzed separately. Results are given as averages of the individual analyses together with their respective standard deviations. Steady-state kinetics were determined by using various concentrations of AdoMet (0.6-6 μm), 0.5 μm, 20-bp DNA, and 50 nm EcoDam. For each individual condition, the time course of DNA methylation was measured between 1 and 30 min. The slope of the initial part of the reaction progress curve was determined by linear regression, and the slopes were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten model to derive the Km and kcat values. For error analysis, by changing all other parameters Km and kcat were minimized and maximized separately, until the deviation of the data points from the fit was significantly worse than that of the best fit as determined by Student’s t test using p = 0.05. UV Cross-linking AdoMet Binding Studies—AdoMet binding to EcoDam was studied by UV cross-linking as described (22Gowher H. Loutchanwoot P. Vorobjeva O. Handa V. Jurkowska R.Z. Jurkowski T.P. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 928-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme (4 μm) and AdoMet (7.2 μm) were incubated in the absence and presence of the specific oligonucleotide (2 μm) for 10 min on ice. The mixture was then subjected to UV cross-linking and AdoMet binding to the enzyme analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To avoid DNA methylation in the experiments, a catalytically inactive EcoDam variant (D181A) was used, which was purified as described (12Liebert K. Hermann A. Schlickenrieder M. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 2-Aminopurine Fluorescence Studies—The kinetics of base flipping were investigated by stopped-flow experiments performed in an SF-3 stopped flow device (BioLogic, Claix, France) as described (12Liebert K. Hermann A. Schlickenrieder M. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using enzyme and DNA at equal concentrations (350 nm) at ambient temperature. The DNA substrate 20-bp AP was a variant of 20 bp containing a 2-aminopurine base at the position of the target base in the upper strand of the DNA. The enzyme was preincubated in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, and 10 μm AdoMet and rapidly mixed with DNA in the same buffer. The 2AP fluorescence was excited at 313 nm, and emission was observed using a 340 nm cut-off filter. The dead time of the experiments was 3.1 ms. Typically, 15-20 injections were accumulated, averaged, and analyzed. All stopped-flow experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. The data represent examples of individual experiments. Error margins are reported as standard deviations based on the comparison of the results of the individual repeats of the experiments. Tryptophan Fluorescence Stopped-flow Studies—Changes of tryptophan fluorescence upon AdoMet binding were determined by stopped-flow experiments performed essentially as described above. In these experiments 20 bp of DNA and enzyme (0.35 μm each) were premixed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl and rapidly mixed with AdoMet in the same buffer. In alternative setups, the experiments were carried out in the absence of DNA. The tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and emission was observed using a 320 nm cut-off filter. The dead time of the experiments was 3.1 ms. Typically, 15-20 shots were accumulated, averaged, and analyzed. All stopped-flow experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. We used an autoinduction procedure (17Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar) that yielded ∼7 mg of purified EcoDam from a 0.5-liter bacterial culture. In the last purification step and during concentration (see “Experimental Procedures”), AdoHcy was added to the protein. During the trials for obtaining crystals of ternary complexes, concentrated binary complexes were mixed with oligonucleotide duplex. Hexagonal crystals were observed under high salt conditions. Although the oligonucleotides were present in solution, the high salt crystal form contains only the binary complexes of EcoDam-AdoHcy. Overall Structure of EcoDam—The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three molecules of EcoDam (Fig. 1A), named α, β, and γ, that are highly similar to each other with a pairwise root-mean-square deviation of less than 0.3 Å comparing 242 pairs of C-α atoms. The binary structure is also highly similar to the ternary structure, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.5 Å between molecule α (binary) and the protein component from the ternary structure of EcoDam-DNA-AdoHcy (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1D for an extract of the superposition). The largest difference in protein conformation between the binary and the ternary structures lies in the hexapeptide (9KWAGGK14) ending with Lys14 whose side chain is disordered in the binary structure (Fig. 1D), with the C-α atoms of Gly12 and Gly13 moved more than 2.0 Å. This hexapeptide sequence motif is highly conserved with two invariant residues of GXK among the GATC-related DNA-(adenine-N6)-MTase orthologs (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 8Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and one residue of that stretch (Lys9) forms the only sequence-specific contact of EcoDam to the Gua of the GATC sequence (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Conformations of AdoHcy—We can model two different conformations of AdoHcy in molecules β and γ, with an estimated 50% occupancy for each conformation (Fig. 1C). The extended conformation (green sticks in Fig. 1C) is the same one described for the ternary structure, as well as for many other DNA MTases (13Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 14Thomas C.B. Scavetta R.D. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26094-26101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In molecule α, the folded conformation (yellow sticks in Fig. 1B) is the predominant conformation. However, residual and broken electron density exists for the extended conformation in molecule α, with an estimated occupancy less than 10%. The adenine and ribose rings of AdoHcy in both conformations occupy the same positions (Fig. 1C). One side of the adenine ring forms face-to-edge van der Waals contacts with the phenyl ring of Phe35 (Fig. 1, B and C); this interaction is highly conserved among DNA MTases via the FXGXG motif I (23Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). On the other side of the adenine ring lies the side chain of Ile55 of motif II. A strongly conserved acidic residue (Asp54 of motif II) forms two hydrogen bonds with both the ribose 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls (Fig. 1, B and C); this is nearly universal to class I MTases (13Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). These interactions have been experimentally shown to be essential for AdoMet binding for many DNA MTases, including the bacterial M.EcoRV (24Roth M. Helm-Kruse S. Friedrich T. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17333-17342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and M.HhaI enzymes (25Sankpal U.T. Rao D.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2628-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the murine Dnmt3a enzymes (22Gowher H. Loutchanwoot P. Vorobjeva O. Handa V. Jurkowska R.Z. Jurkowski T.P. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 928-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A unique interaction of EcoDam involves the indole group of Trp10, whose ring nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with one of the ribose hydroxyls (Fig. 1, B and C). This residue had been shown before to be in close proximity to the cofactor by UV cross-linking reaction (26Wenzel C. Guschlbauer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The dihedral angle, C-4′-C-5′-Sδ-Cγ, begins to define whether the AdoHcy is extended (∼160°) or folded (∼80°). In the extended conformation (green sticks in Fig. 1, C-E), the peptide backbone atoms of GXG of motif I lie underneath the homocysteine moiety, whereas Asp181 interacts with the amino group (NH+3). In the folded conformation (yellow sticks in Fig. 1, B-D), the amino group of AdoHcy makes a cation-π interaction with the aromatic ring of Tyr184 and forms a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of Asp181. In addition, the AdoHcy carboxyl oxygen atoms (COO-) interact with the backbone amide of Tyr184 (Fig. 1, B and C). The Sδ-Cγ bond occupies a position corresponding to the Sδ-CH3 bond in AdoMet as observed in M.RsrI (14Thomas C.B. Scavetta R.D. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26094-26101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Thus, in the folded conformation the homocysteine moiety of the AdoHcy occupies the active site pocket, where the target Ade would bind to after being flipped out from the double helix. Previously, two distinct binding conformations (one for AdoMet and the other for AdoHcy) were observed in M.RsrI (14Thomas C.B. Scavetta R.D. Gumport R.I. Churchill M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26094-26101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and M.TaqI in the absence of DNA (27Schluckebier G. Kozak M. Bleimling N. Weinhold E. Saenger W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Superimposition indicates that the extended conformation of AdoHcy in EcoDam represents the AdoMet conformation in M.RsrI, whereas the folded AdoHcy conformation in EcoDam corresponds to the AdoHcy conformation in M.RsrI (Fig. 2A) and M.TaqI (data not shown). Solution Studies on AdoMet and AdoHcy Binding—We suspected that the close proximity of cofactor and Trp10 might induce changes in the fluorescence of this tryptophan upon binding of cofactor or its analog. As shown in Fig. 2B, the fluorescence of tryptophan in EcoDam was reduced by about 10% after rapid mixing of AdoMet and EcoDam-DNA complex. To test if this change indeed is because of the interaction of AdoMet with Trp10, EcoDam variants were prepared in which Trp10 or Trp236 (the only other tryptophan in this protein) was mutated to tyrosine (W10Y) or leucine (W236L). Both variants exhibited wild type-like catalytic activity (data not shown). However, the W10Y variant did not show a change in fluorescence upon AdoMet addition, whereas the W236L variant behaved like the wild type enzyme. This indicates that it is the close approximation of the cofactor and Trp10 that causes the change of fluorescence in EcoDam. The fluorescence stopped-flow signal was employed to study the kinetics of AdoMet/AdoHcy binding to EcoDam and EcoDam-DNA complexes. As shown in Fig. 2C, neither AdoMet nor AdoHcy binding to the free enzyme was detectable. Although it cannot be ruled out completely that AdoMet or AdoHcy bind to the free enzyme as well but do not cause a change in fluorescence at Trp10, this is very unlikely because the close contact between cofactor and Trp10 is seen in the binary (this work) and ternary complexes (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this context it is noteworthy that DNA was present in the initial mixture used for crystallization; the high salt conditions probably disrupted the protein-DNA interaction, but the cofactor stayed bound to the enzyme after the DNA disassociation. AdoMet binding was detectable when the enzyme was preincubated with the 20-bp oligonucleotide substrate. Preferential binding of AdoMet to EcoDam-DNA complexes was confirmed by UV cross-linking cofactor binding studies using the catalytically inactive D181A variant (Fig. 2E). Given these results our data suggest that in the catalytic cycle of EcoDam, AdoMet usually associates with enzyme bound to DNA (either at a specific site or at nonspecific sites). This agrees with the observation that the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme preincubated with DNA and then mixed with AdoMet is higher than if the enzyme is preincubated with AdoMet (28Urig S. Gowher H. Hermann A. Beck C. Fatemi M. Humeny A. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1085-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). On the basis of the total fluorescence changes observed in the stopped-flow cofactor binding experiments, in the presence of DNA, binding to AdoMet was 1.8 ± 0.2-fold stronger than binding to AdoHcy, if the enzyme was bound to DNA. This result was confirmed by stopped-flow AdoMet/AdoHcy binding experiments conducted in the presence of specific DNA at different concentrations of AdoMet or AdoHcy (supplemental Fig. 2). The fluorescence traces were fitted to mono-exponential curves, and the apparent rates were re-plotted against the cofactor concentrations to determine the rate constants of cofactor binding and release. This analysis indicates that kon was ∼2-fold higher for AdoMet (1.9 × 104 s-1 m-1) than for AdoHcy (8.4 × 103 s-1 m-1), whereas koff was the same for both (AdoMet, 0.29 s-1; AdoHcy, 0.28 s-1). One caveat of these experiments is that DNA methylation takes place in the presence of specific DNA and AdoMet. Then the AdoMet is turned over to AdoHcy during the experiment, indicating that the preference for AdoMet might be even higher than determined here. Side Chain of Lys14 Communicates between DNA Binding, Cofactor Binding, and Base Flipping—In the ternary EcoDam-DNA-AdoHcy complex (4Horton J.R. Liebert K. Bekes M. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the side chain of Lys14 interacts with side chains of Asp181 and Tyr184 of the DPPY motif (Fig. 1E). The same DKY interactions were observed in the structures of T4 Dam (8Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), where the corresponding lysine residue Lys11 is close to the ring N-1 atom of the target Ade (9Horton J.R. Liebert K. Hattman S. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Cell. 2005; 121: 349-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Substitution of arginine for the corresponding lysine in M.EcoRV (K16R) altered the specificity toward the target base suggesting that the lysine residue is close to the active site in this enzyme as well (29Roth M. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3137-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, the conserved DKY interaction is likely to be critical for normal function of EcoDam by providing additional stability to the active site. In the binary structure presented here, the DKY interaction is disrupted, and the side chain of Lys14 in all three molecules (α, β, and γ) is disordered. Comparison of the ternary and binary structures of EcoDam suggests that in the presence of specific DNA, AdoHcy prefers the extended conformation, and Lys14 helps to stabilize the binding pocket for the flipped base. We studied the kinetic properties of a K14A variant to define the role of Lys14 in base flipping. At a ratio 1:4 of enzyme (0.25 μm) to substrate (1 μm), DNA methylation by EcoDam showed a burst phase (first turnover) followed by a linear phase (following turnovers in steady state) (Fig. 3A). During the burst, the K14A variant methylated DNA at about a 2-fold reduced rate compared with wild type EcoDam; in addition, the magnitude of the burst was reduced 3-fold indicating some partitioning of the complex into nonproductive conformations. Under steady-state conditions (Fig. 3B), the Km value for AdoMet of the K14A variant was similar to wild type ("

In this study, we show direct evidence that Fxrα is a key player in maintaining sulfate homeostasis. We identified and characterized the sodium/sulfate co-transporter (NaS-1; Slc13a1) as an Fxrα target gene expressed in the kidney and intestine. Electromobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and promoter reporter studies identified a single functional Fxrα response element in the second intron of the mouse Slc13a1 gene. Treatment of wild-type mice with GW4064, a synthetic Fxrα agonist, induced Slc13a1 mRNA in the intestine and kidney. Slc13a1 mRNA was also induced in the kidney and intestine of wild-type, but not Fxrα–/– mice, after treatment with the hepatotoxin α-naphthylisothiocyanate, which is known to result in elevated blood bile acid levels. Finally, we observed a decrease in Slc13a1 mRNA in the kidney and intestine of Fxrα–/– mice and a corresponding increase in urinary excretion of free sulfates as compared with wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that mouse Slc13a1 is a novel Fxrα target gene expressed in the kidney and intestine and that in the absence of Fxrα, mice waste sulfate into the urine. Thus, Fxrα is necessary for normal sulfate homeostasis in vivo. Fxrα is known to regulate a variety of metabolic processes, including bile acid, cholesterol, and carbohydrate metabolism.

Thus, Fxrα is necessary for normal sulfate homeostasis in vivo. Inorganic sulfate is one of the most abundant anions in mammalian blood and is essential for numerous physiological functions (1Markovich D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1499-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Sulfation of endogenous and exogenous substances such as steroids, neurotransmitters, xenobiotics, and bile acids is a key process in their activation or detoxification of these compounds (2Falany C.N. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Sulfation is also essential for the biosynthesis of a variety of structural molecules, such as glycosaminoglycan sulfate, cerebroside sulfate, and heparin sulfate (3Farooqui A.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1980; 100: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In mammals, sulfate homeostasis is largely regulated by the kidney. The majority of filtered sulfate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules, and only ∼5–20% of the filtered load is excreted into the urine (4Markovich D. Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transcellular transport of sulfate from tubular lumen to blood depends on the sodium/sulfate co-transporter (NaS-1, Slc13a1) in the brush-border membrane (for sulfate entry into the cell) and a sulfate/anion exchanger (Sat-1, Slc26a1) in the basolateral membrane (for sulfate efflux into the blood) (4Markovich D. Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A similar transcellular transport pathway is also used in the small intestine, mainly the distal ileum, for dietary sulfate absorption (1Markovich D. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1499-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Slc13a1 was originally cloned from a rat renal cortex cDNA library using the Xenopus oocyte expression cloning system (5Markovich D. Forgo J. Stange G. Biber J. Murer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8073-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This co-transporter is predominantly expressed in the renal cortex and ileum. Previous studies showed that thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, and vitamin D can modulate serum sulfate levels, renal sulfate handling, and Slc13a1 expression (6Lee A. Dawson P.A. Markovich D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1350-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Farnesoid X receptor α (Fxrα; NR1H4) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (7Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

In 1999, three groups independently identified bile acids as endogenous activators of Fxrα, providing critical insight into Fxrα function (14Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M.

Subsequent studies have shown tissue-specific expression of four distinct Fxrα isoforms (Fxrα1, Fxrα2, Fxrα3, and Fxrα4) that are derived from alternative promoters and splicing (17Huber R.M.

Along with their tissue-specific expression, certain target genes of Fxrα are regulated in an isoform-specific manner. Most of the Fxrα targets identified to date are regulated by all four Fxrα isoforms (18Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

However, a few of the targets are highly regulated by the Fxrα2 and Fxrα4 isoforms and relatively refractory to Fxrα1 and Fxrα3. Such genes include I-BABP, FGF-19, CryAA, and SDC-1 (12Anisfeld A.M.

Fxrα has been shown to have crucial roles in controlling bile acid homeostasis, lipoprotein and glucose metabolism, hepatic regeneration, intestinal bacterial growth, response to hepatotoxins, and resistance to hepatocarcinomas (19Lee F.Y. Lee H. Hubbert M.L. Edwards P.A. Zhang Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 572-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These studies have identified important functions for Fxrα in both the liver and intestine. In contrast, the functional importance of Fxrα in the kidney and adrenal gland is poorly understood, despite the fact that these organs express high levels of Fxrα. Recently, we and others have shown that Fxrα regulates the organic solute transporters α and β (Ostα and Ostβ) in the intestine (21Lee H. Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Nelson S.F. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. J.

In the ileum, Ostα and Ostβ function as a heteromeric basolateral bile acid transporter that functions in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (29Ballatori N. Christian W.V. Lee J.Y.

Whether Ostα and Ostβ also affect bile acid flux through the kidney and adrenal gland remains to be determined. In the current study, we provide direct evidence that Fxrα is a key player in the regulation of sulfate homeostasis in mice. We identified the sodium/sulfate co-transporter, Slc13a1, as a gene regulated by Fxrα in the kidney and intestine. In vivo studies show that Fxrα–/– mice display increased sulfate wasting into the urine. The data presented herein indicate that Slc13a1 is a novel Fxrα target gene in the kidney and intestine and that Fxrα is necessary to maintain the basal expression of Slc13a1 and thus normal sulfate homeostasis. Materials—Expression constructs for the human FXRα1 and FXRα2 (pcDNA-hFXRα1 and pcDNA-hFXRα2) and human RXRα (pCMX-hRXRα) have been described previously (20Lee F.Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Chang J. Luo G.

Tim Willson and Patrick Malloney (GlaxoSmithKline). α-Naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT) was purchased from Sigma. RNA Isolation and Real Time Quantitative PCR—RNA from tissues was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed essentially as described (21Lee H. Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Nelson S.F. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA from tissues was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Each amplification mixture (20 μl) contained 50 ng of cDNA, 375 nm forward primer, 375 nm reverse primer, and 10 μl of SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). PCR thermocycling parameters were 95 °C for 2.5 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 45 s. Real-time PCR was carried out using the Bio-Rad MyIQ single color real time PCR detection system. Each sample was assayed in duplicate and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Quantitative expression values were extrapolated from separate standard curves. Identification of a Putative FXRE and EMSA—A putative FXRE in the second intron of Slc13a1 was identified using the NUBIScan computer algorithm (available on the World Wide Web). This approach is based on a weighted nucleotide distribution matrix compiled from published functional hexamer half-sites. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (21Lee H. Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Nelson S.F. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Human FXR isoforms or human RXRα was synthesized in vitro using the TNT T7-coupled reticulocyte system (Promega). The sense strand sequence for wild-type and mutant Slc13a1 were 5′-cgagaggcccaggtcaatgtccggatggatgcc-3′ (Slc13a1) and 5′-cgagaggcccagAAcaatgtTcggatggatgcc-3′ (mutSlc13a1). The IR-1 is in boldface type, and mutations are capitalized. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Wild-type mice were treated with either vehicle or GW4064 once a day for 5 days at 50 mg/kg and sacrificed, and kidneys were excised. The initial fixation of the kidneys, isolation of nuclear fraction, and sonication of chromatin were performed as described (31Matsukuma K.E. Bennett M.K. Huang J. Wang L. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2754-2761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using the Active Motif ChIP-IT kit according to the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. Briefly, the sheared chromatin was precleared twice with goat IgG (20 μg) and Protein G beads, and an aliquot was stored to use subsequently as “input.” Aliquots of the precleared sheared chromatin were then immunoprecipitated using goat IgG (20 μg) or anti-FXRα antibody (C-20X; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (20 μg). The resulting DNA was released from protein and used for real time quantitative PCR analysis.

Mutations are capitalized. The Slc13a1 proximal promoter (–1986 to +22 relative to the transcriptional start site) was amplified from mouse genomic DNA and cloned into KpnI/NheI sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) to generate pGL3-Slc13a1. The Slc13a1 (–1986 to +22) construct was amplified using the 5′ primer 5′-cccggtacctgggcattttggaattatgg-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-cccgctagcgagcaggtgccttcaacagt-3′. Transient transfections were performed on 48-well plates essentially as described (21Lee H. Zhang Y. Lee F.Y. Nelson S.F. Gonzalez F.J. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 201-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 ng of pCMX-hRXRα, 100 ng of reporter construct, and 50 ng of pCMX-β-galactosidase, together with 50 ng of pcDNA-hFXRα1 or pcDNA-hFXRα2, were cotransfected into HepG2 cells using the MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene). The cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or the indicated ligands in 10% superstripped fetal bovine serum (HyClone) for 24 h. Luciferase activity was assayed and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least three times. Animal Experiments—Eight to 10-week-old male and female Fxrα–/– mice (32Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar) and their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and fed a standard chow diet. Where indicated, wild-type mice (four mice/group) were gavaged twice a day for 4 days with either vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin) or GW4064 (dissolved in vehicle) at 30 mg/kg. Animals were euthanized, and the tissues were excised and homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. In the initial screen (Table 1), RNA was isolated from the liver, kidney, and intestine of mice (two mice/group). RNA samples were subjected to real time quantitative PCR analysis in duplicate by Xenoport Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Subsequent analyses were performed on RNA isolated from four individual mice treated as indicated. For the ANIT experiment, 8–10-week-old male and female Fxrα–/– mice and their wild-type C57BL/6J littermates were gavaged with a single dose of vehicle (olive oil) or ANIT dissolved in vehicle (75 mg/kg). Individual animals were placed in metabolic cages for urine collection and were provided a standard chow diet and water. Animals were euthanized at 48 h after the ANIT dose, and the indicated tissues were excised and homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA extraction. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Urine and serum were stored at –80 °C until further use.TABLE 1Real time quantitative PCR screen of transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymesGenes induced ≥1.5-fold in response to GW4064Tissues that show inductionATP8A1 (ATPase IA, ATPase II)LiverATPB1 (FIC 1, ATPase IC)LiverOATP2 (Slc21a5)Liver, kidney, small intestineOATP-B (Slco2b1)LiverRBAT (Slc3a1, NBAT)Liver, small intestineAbcC10 (Mrp7)Liver, kidney, small intestineCES1 (carboxylesterase 1)LiverCES3 (carboxylesterase 3)LiverPIT-1 (Slc20a1, GLVR1)LiverPHT1 (Slc15a4, PRT4)LiverPEPT2 (Slc15a2)LiverMCT11 (Slc16a11)LiverMCT6 (Slc16a5)LiverNaSi-1 (Slc13a1, NaS-1)Kidney, small intestineSat-1 (Slc26a1)Liver, kidney, small intestineSat-4 (Slc26a4, Pendrin)KidneySat-2 (Slc26a2, DTDST)Small intestineSat-3 (Slc26a3, DRA, CLD)Small intestineSMVT (Slc5a6)Small intestineOstαKidney, small intestineOstβKidney, small intestine Open table in a new tab Measurement of Serum and Urinary Sulfate—Urinary creatinine was measured using the Prameter Creatinine Kit (R & D Systems). Inorganic sulfate levels in urine or serum were assayed by a turbidimetric method as described (33Lee S. Dawson P.A. Hewavitharana A.K. Shaw P.N. Markovich D. Hepatology. 2006; 43: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, urine was diluted 1:20 with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Serum samples were deproteinated by mixing with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were placed on ice for 30 min and centrifuged, and the sulfate present in the supernatant was collected for the assay. Standards of Na2SO4 (0.5–2.0 mm for urine samples and 0.125–1.0 mm for serum samples) were prepared in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Fifty-μl samples, standards, or blanks were added to a 96-well plate in triplicate. Fifty μl of 30% glycerol was then added and covered, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Twenty-five μl of 1% BaCl2 in 10% dextran was then added to all wells. After the contents in the wells were mixed, the absorbance was determined using a microplate reader set at a wavelength of 600 nm. The correlation coefficient of the standard curves was >0.99. Serum and urine sulfate levels were normalized to protein and creatinine, respectively. Statistical Analysis—Mean values and S.E. were determined by the analysis of multiple independent samples, each assayed in duplicate or triplicate, as indicated in the figure legends. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to calculate p values. Identification of Slc13a1 as a Putative Fxrα Target Gene—In an attempt to identify novel Fxrα target genes, we initially treated two wild-type mice with vehicle or the potent Fxrα agonist, GW4064, for 4 days. RNA was isolated from three (liver, kidney, and intestine) of the four tissues that express significant levels of Fxrα. The relative expression levels of 250 known transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes were determined by real time quantitative PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). Analysis of the data suggested that ∼20 genes, including the sodium/sulfate co-transporter (NaS-1, Slc13a1) and sulfate anion transporter (Sat-1, Slc26a1), were induced greater than 1.5-fold in the kidney, intestine, or liver by GW4064 (Table 1). In an attempt to confirm the data shown in Table 1 and to eliminate false positives, we treated additional wild-type mice (four mice/group) with either vehicle or GW4064 and isolated RNA from liver, kidney, and intestine. RNA levels of selective genes were quantified in individual mice using real time quantitative PCR using primer sets (Table 2) that differed from those used in the original screen. As indicated in Fig. 1, A and B, Slc13a1 message was significantly induced in the wild-type kidney and intestine in response to GW4064 (p < 0.05), whereas no discernable changes were observed with Slc26a1 mRNA expression. We conclude that the identification of Slc26a1 as a gene induced by Fxrα activation in the preliminary screen (Table 1) was a false positive. In addition to Slc13a1, a sulfotransferase (Sult2a1) and a bile acid transporter (Mrp2), two previously identified Fxrα targets involved in bile acid detoxification in the liver (13Kast H.R. Goodwin B. Tarr P.T. Jones S.A. Anisfeld A.M. Stoltz C.M. Tontonoz P. Kliewer S. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 720-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), were also induced in the kidney in response to GW4064 (Fig. 1A). These inductions were specific, since a xenobiotic sulfotransferase (Sult1a1) was not induced (Fig. 1A). Ostα, a previously identified Fxrα target gene expressed in the kidney and intestine, was induced and served as a positive control (Fig. 1, A and B). Moreover, quantitative PCR analysis revealed that Slc13a1 is not expressed in the liver (data not shown). The data in Fig. 1 suggest that activation of renal Fxrα following oral administration of GW4064 induces the mRNA expression of an apical sulfate transporter, Slc13a1, as well as genes involved in bile acid sulfation and transport. In contrast, the data demonstrated that the expression of the basolateral sulfate transporter, Slc26a1, was unaffected. Identification of an FXRE within the Second Intron of the Mouse Slc13a1 Gene—Since Slc13a1 mRNA was significantly induced in both the kidney and intestine of GW4064-treated mice, we scanned the proximal promoter of the mouse Slc13a1 gene for putative FXREs using the NUBIScan computer algorithm (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, no putative IR-1 was identified in the region 10 kb upstream of the mouse Slc13a1 transcription start site. Further in silico analysis of the intronic regions of the gene identified a putative IR-1 within the second intron (Fig. 2A). We then used in vitro transcribed and translated RXRα and FXRα2 proteins in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine whether the FXRα/RXRα heterodimer can bind to this putative FXRE. The data in Fig. 2B show that the FXRα2/RXRα heterodimer binds to radiolabeled probes containing the Slc13a1 IR-1 (Fig. 2B, lane 7). Probes containing a well characterized IR-1/FXRE from the PLTP proximal promoter (35Urizar N.L. Dowhan D.H. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39313-39317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) served as a positive control (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In addition, unlabeled wild-type Slc13a1 IR-1 effectively competed for the binding of FXRα2/RXRα heterodimers (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–5 and 8–10), whereas the formation of the shifted complex was relatively unaffected by the presence of the unlabeled DNA containing the mutated IR-1 sequences (mutSlc13a1) (Fig. 2B, lanes 11–13). In order to confirm that Fxrα is associated with the putative FX"
https://openalex.org/W1976925358,"Superoxide reductase is a novel class of non-heme iron proteins that catalyzes the one-electron reduction of O(2)(.) to H(2)O(2), providing an antioxidant defense in some bacteria. Its active site consists of an unusual non-heme Fe(2+) center in a [His(4) Cys(1)] square pyramidal pentacoordination. In this class of enzyme, the cysteine axial ligand has been hypothesized to be an essential feature in the reactivity of the enzyme. Previous Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies on the enzyme from Desulfoarculus baarsii revealed that a protonated carboxylate group, proposed to be the side chain of Glu(114), is in interaction with the cysteine ligand. In this work, using pulse radiolysis, Fourier transform infrared, and resonance Raman spectroscopies, we have investigated to what extent the presence of this Glu(114) carboxylic lateral chain affects the strength of the S-Fe bond and the reaction of the iron active site with superoxide. The E114A mutant shows significantly modified pulse radiolysis kinetics for the protonation process of the first reaction intermediate. Resonance Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the E114A mutation results in both a strengthening of the S-Fe bond and an increase in the extent of freeze-trapping of a Fe-peroxo species after treatment with H(2)O(2) by a specific strengthening of the Fe-O bond. A fine tuning of the strength of the S-Fe bond by the presence of Glu(114) appears to be an essential factor for both the strength of the Fe-O bond and the pK(a) value of the Fe(3+)-peroxo intermediate species to form the reaction product H(2)O(2)."
