https://openalex.org/W2024938223,The average evoked-potential waveforms to sound and light stimuli recorded from scalp in awake human subjects show differences as a function of the subject's degree of uncertainty with respect to the sensory modality of the stimulus to be presented. Differences are also found in the evoked potential as a function of whether or not the sensorymodality of the stimulus was anticipated correctly. The major waveform alteration is in the amplitude of a positive-going component which reaches peak amplitude at about 300 milliseconds.

https://openalex.org/W2085923215,Short-day photoperiods in conjunction with a second stimulus were required to induce sexual reproduction (and diapause) in an autumnally diapausing strain of Daphnia pulex. The second stimulus was associated with the unalkalized portion of a small lake and with density of the population in laboratory cultures. Diapause was induced at 12 degrees and 19 degrees C.

https://openalex.org/W2076635868,Absolute hearing thresholds for two bats were determined by an operant conditioning technique. Pure tones rangingFrom 2.5 to 100 kilocycles per second were perceived by a single Eptesicus fuscus. Its maximum sensitivity was on the order of 68 decibles below 1 dyne per square centimeter and occurred at 20 kc/ sec. Maximum sensitivity for a single Myotis lucifugus was about 64 db below 1 dyne/ cm2 and occurred at 40 kc/ sec. The Myotis clearly heard a tone of120 kc/ sec but gave no evidence of hearing below 10 kc/ sec.

https://openalex.org/W2055777003,"A method for determining the spectral sensitivity of the different color mechanisms of the human eye uses the pattern of color names applied to small, brief, dim, monochromatic flashes. Such responses are often due to the activation of single neural units. Preliminary spectral sensitivity curves for two color mechanisms have been obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2021986402,"Three mutants at three different phosphatase loci produce inactive enzymes at 35°C but partially or fully active enzymes at 25°C. Furthermore, a suppressor mutant (su5palA1) which restores alkaline phosphatase activity in the palA1 mutant is an allele of palcC4, a mutant with a simultaneous reduction in alkaline and acid phosphatase activity. These data suggest that the phosphatase proteins may be made up of two or more different polypeptide chains, and that some of the polypeptide chains are common to two or more of these enzymes."

Conditional differentiation in galvanic skin responses occurred only in the group of subjects who accurately verbalized the stimulus contingencies.

https://openalex.org/W2088319446,"Guinea pigs injected with 100 micrograms of p-azobenzenearsonate derivatives of hexa-L-tyrosine, tri-L-tyrosine, or N-acetyl-L-tyrosine amide, in complete Freund's adjuvant, developed, after 10 to 19 days, delayed-type hypersensitivity to these substances. This was shown by skin reactions, followed by the formation of circulating antibodies that were detectable by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. Experiments with p-azobenzenearsonate-hexa-L-tyrosine labeledwith iodine-131 showed that this substance was bound in vitro to proteins of normal guinea pig serum. Binding was similar with the nonantigenic hexa-L-tyrosine and its p-azobenzoate derivative."

The methane- forming enzyme only functions in the presence of adenosine triphosphate, and although the role of adenosine triphosphate in this reaction is not understood, this cofactor has been shown to play an important part in the regulation of Cr transfer in this organism. The position of methylcobalamin in methane forma- tion is discussed. &lcnowledgment-We thank Mr. Norman Ryckman and Mr. Jack Althaus for assistance. 1. 2. 3. 4. 9. 10. 11. 12. SCHIRCH, L.

Because of possible vaporization of DDT during sampling, concentrations reported represent minimum values but demonstrate that DDT can be present in an urban atmosphere that is distant from any large-scale agricultural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2025801790,"Electrophoretic differences in hemoglobins and transferrins serve to differentiate Anolis of the same species populating the Lesser Antilles. When based on protein analyses, identifications of individuals may be less equivocal than identification based on descriptions of skin color and markings. Protein differences among island populations appear to be associated with long periods of geographic isolation. Such evidence often confirms estimates of relationship derived from more traditional criteria and in some cases provides a basis for formulating new taxonomic conclusions."

https://openalex.org/W1977677480,Genetic analysis of several hundred progeny from crosses of two heterothallic species of Achlya and Dictyuchus provides preliminary information about the life cycle and pattern of sexuality in the biflagellate Phycomycetes. Extensive testing of mycelial progeny indicates a diploid life cycle. Control of sexual expression and mating competence appears to be based on a complex genetic system.

https://openalex.org/W1967128192,"In response to the floral stimulus, Xanthium buds synthesize relatively more messenger RNA than do vegetative buds. This is demonstrated by fractionation, on methylated albumin-kieselguhr columns, of a mixture of nucleic acids from vegetative and induced buds, one being labeled with uridine-H(3) and the other with uridine-2-C(14). While floral induction stimulates a small increase in messenger RNA synthesis as revealed by labeling intact plants, this difference can be magnified by labeling excised buds in solution. From experiments with excised buds from Xanthium plants, it is concluded that buds from photoperiodically induced plants contain more messenger RNA than buds from noninduced ones do."

Unconditioned animals transferred to a modified temperature were less refractory to the venoms than those conditioned for 48 hours, but all animals stressed were less refractory than unstressed animals. Animals receiving a series of small doses of epinephrine were similarly affected. This apparent change in toxicity of the venoms seems to be due to the physiological effects of stress rather than to the temperature per se."
