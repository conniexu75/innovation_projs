Several types of arrangement, for example, even, random, partial random, and restricted random, have been proposed and defended. Hilditch (I) and Bhattacharyya (2) have recently reviewed the bases of these various theories. One reason that a number of theories developed has been the lack of suitable methods for the isolation and characterization of glycerides. It is possible, with fairly quantitative yields, to separate the triglycerides of a natural fat into glyceride classes, i.e. trisaturated, disaturated, monosaturated, and triunsaturated. However, only with a limited number of fats has it been possible to separate major proportions of single glycerides which can be identified by thermal and x-ray diffraction techniques. For instance, it has been shown that 2-oleoyl distearin comprises approximately 60 per cent of kokum butter (3, 4), that 2-oleoyl dipalmitin is the principal single triglyceride of stillingia tallow (5), and that 2-oleoyl palmitoyl stearin is present to the extent of 50 per cent in cocoa butter (6-8). Thus, the conclusively identified disaturated glycerides of vegetable oils are exclusively 2-oleoyl disaturated. On the other hand, lard has a very high proportion of 2-palmitoyl stearoyl “olein,” clearly in contrast with beef and mutton tallow (9, 10). Thus, the evidence, although scattered, is indisputable for the occurrence in several different organisms of specific glycerides in proportions far in excess of expectations for random distribution. Nevertheless, reports continue to appear containing data which are interpreted as supporting an element of randomness in glyceride organization (11, 12). In 1956 Mattson and Beck (13) demonstrated the specificity of pancreatic lipase for the cleavage of ester linkages at the 1 and 3 positions of triglycerides and suggested that this offered a new tool for study of triglyceride structure, a tool with certain obvious advantages over previous means. This method of enzymatic hydrolysis has been applied by Savary, Flanzy, and Desnuelle (7) to fractions of eight natural glycerides. On the basis of iodine value and, in some instances, identification of the fatty acids, they concluded that the fatty acids were not distributed at random. In the present study the enzymatic technique, applied to twelve vegetable fats and seven animal fats, has yielded strong evidence for a high degree of specificity in fatty acid distribution in the glycerides of natural fats."

https://openalex.org/W1975095718,"STARCH-GEL electrophoresis, as introduced by Smithies1, has proved superior to both free and filter-paper electrophoresis for separating protein mixtures2–6. However, the opacity of the strips excludes the possibility of direct quantitative evaluation of separated proteins, though this is possible with the other two electrophoretic methods. This problem was successfully solved recently by Fine and Waszczenko7, who prepared starch-gel suitable for direct quantitative evaluation by transmission photometry. A simpler and quicker method for obtaining transparency of the strips is presented here."

https://openalex.org/W1993814034,"SAMPLES of human urine have been examined for indole and phenol acids as a matter of routine in this laboratory for several months; the methods used for extraction and two-dimensional paper chromatography were described earlier1,2. The chromatograms were satisfactory until certain days in April, when the normally pink and purple spots given by indoles with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde showed a diminished colour intensity and brown discoloration. The colours became so weak in May that indole spots could not be seen with certainty. Unlike the indoles, the phenolic acids gave colours which were normal immediately after spraying with diazotized sulphanilic acid, but which faded and were discoloured afterwards to an increasing extent. No improvement was obtained when the components of the chromatographic solvents were purified extensively."
