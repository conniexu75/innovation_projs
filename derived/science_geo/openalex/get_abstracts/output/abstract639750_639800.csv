https://openalex.org/W2974682550,"The kindergarten program, Tools of the Mind (Tools), has been shown to improve executive functions (as assessed by laboratory measures) and academic performance. The objective here was to see if Tools can improve executive functions in the real world (in the classroom), academic outcomes not previously investigated, reduce bullying and peer ostracism, and increase teachers' and students' joy in being in the classroom. This first randomized controlled trial of Tools in Canada included 351 kindergarten children (mean age 5.2 years at entry; 51% female) in 18 public schools. Stratified randomization resulted in teachers and students in both groups being closely matched. Teachers in both groups received the same number of training hours and same funds for new materials. Outcome measures were pre and post standardized academic skill assessments and teacher online survey responses. This study replicated that Tools improves reading and shows for the first time that it improves writing (far exceeding levels the school districts had seen before), self-control and attention-regulation in the real world (e.g., time on task without supervision), reduces teacher burnout and children being ostracized or excluded, and increases the joy students and teachers experience in school. By Spring, Tools teachers were still enthusiastic about teaching; control teachers were exhausted. These results were not only better than the control group but also better than Tools teachers experienced the year before Tools. Thus, children in a kindergarten curriculum that emphasized play, improving self-regulation, working together and helping one another, and hands-on learning performed better academically, showed less bullying and peer ostracism and more kindness and helping behavior than students in more traditional classes, and teacher enthusiasm for teaching soared. Tools reduced initial disparities separating children, schools, and teachers."
https://openalex.org/W2973873733,"The present study reports on observations carried out in the Tropical North Atlantic in summer and autumn 2017, documenting Sargassum aggregations using both ship-deck observations and satellite sensor observations at three resolutions (MSI-10 m, OLCI-300 m, VIIRS-750 m and MODIS-1 km). Both datasets reported that in summer, Sargassum aggregations were mainly observed off Brazil and near the Caribbean Islands, while they accumulated near the African coast in autumn. Based on in situ observations, we propose a five-class typology allowing standardisation of the description of in situ Sargassum raft shapes and sizes. The most commonly observed Sargassum raft type was windrows, but large rafts composed of a quasi-circular patch hundreds of meters wide were also observed. Satellite imagery showed that these rafts formed larger Sargassum aggregations over a wide range of scales, with smaller aggregations (of tens of m2 area) nested within larger ones (of hundreds of km2). Match-ups between different satellite sensors and in situ observations were limited for this dataset, mainly because of high cloud cover during the periods of observation. Nevertheless, comparisons between the two datasets showed that satellite sensors successfully detected Sargassum abundance and aggregation patterns consistent with in situ observations. MODIS and VIIRS sensors were better suited to describing the Sargassum aggregation distribution and dynamics at Atlantic scale, while the new sensors, OLCI and MSI, proved their ability to detect Sargassum aggregations and to describe their (sub-) mesoscale nested structure. The high variability in raft shape, size, thickness, depth and biomass density observed in situ means that caution is called for when using satellite maps of Sargassum distribution and biomass estimation. Improvements would require additional in situ and airborne observations or very high-resolution satellite imagery."
https://openalex.org/W2974823915,"RNA viruses, once considered specific to honey bees, are suspected of spilling over from managed bees into wild pollinators; however, transmission routes are largely unknown. A widely accepted yet untested hypothesis states that flowers serve as bridges in the transmission of viruses between bees. Here, using a series of controlled experiments with captive bee colonies, we examined the role of flowers in bee virus transmission. We first examined if honey bees deposit viruses on flowers and whether bumble bees become infected after visiting contaminated flowers. We then examined whether plant species differ in their propensity to harbor viruses and if bee visitation rates increase the likelihood of virus deposition on flowers. Our experiment demonstrated, for the first time, that honey bees deposit viruses on flowers. However, the two viruses we examined, black queen cell virus (BQCV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), were not equally distributed across plant species, suggesting that differences in floral traits, virus ecology and/or foraging behavior may mediate the likelihood of deposition. Bumble bees did not become infected after visiting flowers previously visited by honey bees suggesting that transmission via flowers may be a rare occurrence and contingent on multiplicative factors and probabilities such as infectivity of virus strain across bee species, immunocompetence, virus virulence, virus load, and the probability a bumble bee will contact a virus particle on a flower. Our study is among the first to experimentally examine the role of flowers in bee virus transmission and uncovers promising avenues for future research."

Curcumin exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties but has poor solubility and rapid plasma clearance. To overcome these physiochemical limitations and uncover the full therapeutic potential of curcumin in lung inflammation, in this study we utilized a novel water-soluble curcumin formulation (CDC) and delivered it directly into the lungs of C57BL/6 mice inoculated with a lethal dose of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP). Administration of CDC led to a significant reduction in mortality, in bacterial presence within blood and lungs, as well as in lung injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The expression of Klebsiella hemolysin gene; TNF-α; IFN-β; nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3; hypoxia-inducible factor 1/2α; and NF-κB were also decreased following CDC treatment, suggesting modulation of the inflammasome complex and hypoxia signaling pathways as an underlying mechanism by which CDC reduces the severity of pneumonia. On a cellular level, CDC led to diminished cell death, improved viability, and protection of human lung epithelial cells in vitro. Overall, our studies demonstrate that CDC administration improves cell survival and reduces injury, inflammation, and mortality in a murine model of lethal gram-negative pneumonia. CDC, therefore, has promising anti-inflammatory potential in pneumonia and likely other inflammatory lung diseases, demonstrating the importance of optimizing the physicochemical properties of active natural products to optimize their clinical application.-Zhang, B., Swamy, S., Balijepalli, S., Panicker, S., Mooliyil, J., Sherman, M.

Alginate was assumed to be indigestible in humans, but bacteria isolated from fecal samples can utilize alginate. Moreover, genomes of some human gut microbiome–associated bacteria encode putative alginate-degrading enzymes. Here, we genome-mined a polysaccharide lyase family 6 alginate lyase from the gut bacterium Bacteroides cellulosilyticus (BcelPL6). The structure of recombinant BcelPL6 was solved by X-ray crystallography to 1.3 Å resolution, revealing a single-domain, monomeric parallel β-helix containing a 10-step asparagine ladder characteristic of alginate-converting parallel β-helix enzymes. Substitutions of the conserved catalytic site residues Lys-249, Arg-270, and His-271 resulted in activity loss. However, imidazole restored the activity of BcelPL6-H271N to 2.5% that of the native enzyme. Molecular docking oriented tetra-mannuronic acid for syn attack correlated with M specificity. Using biochemical analyses, we found that BcelPL6 initially releases unsaturated oligosaccharides of a degree of polymerization of 2–7 from alginate and polyM, which were further degraded to di- and trisaccharides. Unlike other PL6 members, BcelPL6 had low activity on polyMG and none on polyG. Surprisingly, polyG increased BcelPL6 activity on alginate 7-fold. LC–electrospray ionization–MS quantification of products and lack of activity on NaBH4-reduced octa-mannuronic acid indicated that BcelPL6 is an endolyase that further degrades the oligosaccharide products with an intact reducing end. We anticipate that our results advance predictions of the specificity and mode of action of PL6 enzymes.

Here, we show that BcelPL6 of PL6 subfamily 1 from the human commensal gut bacterium Bacteroides cellulosilyticus CRE21 is a monomeric, single-domain polyM-specific enzyme. The crystal structure is solved to 1.3 Å resolution and contains a long, highly-conserved asparagine ladder. The residues at the active site provide insights into specificity determinants in PL6. Most known genes from marine Bacteroides associated with alginate utilization, except from PL7, have orthologues in B. cellulosilyticus CRE21 as identified by a BLAST search. Searching against nonredundant protein sequences revealed that BcelPL6 is conserved in Bacteroides with homologues of >85% sequence identity in strains of human gut Bacteroides intestinalis, Bacteroides sp. 14(A), Bacteroides oleiciplenus, Bacteroides timonensis, and Bacteroides stercorirosoris. Although gene up-regulation has not been analyzed for human gut Bacteroides growing on alginate, it has been reported in the cases of several members of PL6, PL7, and PL17 from the marine Gramella forsetti that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum and for Alteromonas macleodii (15Kabisch A.

Therefore, sequence-based prediction of PL6 specificities is currently not reliable. BcelPL6 catalyzed the release of products with unsaturated nonreducing ends (Fig. 1B) from alginate (Fig. 2A) and polyM (Fig. 2B). The reactions followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and kcat was 8-fold higher for polyM (43.4 ± 1.6 s−1) than alginate (kcat = 5.4 ± 0.15 s−1), whereas Km was 3-fold lower for alginate (0.59 ± 0.04 mg ml−1) than polyM (Km = 1.96 ± 0.18 mg ml−1) (Table 1). Activity was barely detected toward polyG (Fig. 2C; Table 1; Fig. S2A) and polyMG (Table 1; Fig. S2B) even at high concentrations (6 μm) of BcelPL6, and the observed very low rates of degradation of 0–2.0 mg ml−1 polyG or polyMG did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Table 1). Trace of product formation from polyG possibly stems from the 3% M being found in the used polyG candidate substrate. Moreover, BcelPL6 did not degrade acetylated polyM that mimics bacterial alginate (Table 1 and"

Methods We identified people with severe mental illness using information on prior specialist mental health treatment. This group were identified from the PREDICT study, a prospective cohort study of 495,388 primary care patients aged 30 to 74 years without prior CVD that was recently used to derive new CVD risk prediction equations. CVD risk was calculated in participants with and without severe mental illness using the new equations and the predicted CVD risk was compared with observed risk in the two participant groups using survival methods. Results 28,734 people with a history of recent contact with specialist mental health services, including those without a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, were identified in the PREDICT cohort. They had a higher observed rate of CVD events compared to those without such a history. The PREDICT equations underestimated the risk for this group, with a mean observed:predicted risk ratio of 1.29 in men and 1.64 in women. In contrast the PREDICT algorithm performed well for those without mental illness. Conclusions Clinicians using CVD risk assessment tools that do not include severe mental illness as a predictor could by underestimating CVD risk by about one-third in men and two-thirds in women in this patient group. All CVD risk prediction equations should be updated to include mental illness indicators."

The first step in FA incorporation is activation by FA kinase, an enzyme system consisting of a kinase domain protein (FakA) that phosphorylates a FA carried by the FA-binding protein component (FakB) (1Parsons J.B.

The resulting acyl-ACP is either utilized by PlsC to acylate the 2-position of 1-acyl-glycerolphosphate or it may enter the FASII cycle and be elongated.

Two major orders of the Firmicutes have distinctly different physiological responses to the presence of extracellular FA.

Heterologous expression, biochemical analyses, and X-ray crystallography confirmed that SpFakB1 specifically bound saturated FA (16:0) and SpFakB2 selectively bound monounsaturated FA (18:1) but also bound saturated FA. Fatty acids are designated by number of carbons:number of double bonds. SpFakB3 is more distantly related to the S. aureus homologs, and heterologous expression and biochemical analyses showed that SpFakB3 expanded the repertoire of substrates to polyunsaturated FA (18:2). The SpFakB3(18:2) structure revealed a different hydrogen bond network anchoring the FA carbonyl and an expanded FA-binding pocket within the hydrophobic interior of the protein that explains its ability to bind FA with multiple cis double bonds. S. pneumoniae strain JMG1 (ΔfakB3) was deficient in 18:2 incorporation verifying the role of SpFakB3 in the incorporation of polyunsaturated FA into S. pneumoniae phospholipids. Thus, the multiple FakBs of S. pneumoniae permit the acquisition and utilization of the entire spectrum of mammalian FA structures to facilitate the acquisition of host FA to construct its membrane at the infection site. The distinct difference between S. aureus and S. pneumoniae utilization of exogenous FA is illustrated by the effect of human serum supplementation on the molecular species composition of PG, a major membrane phospholipid in both organisms (Fig. 1). S. pneumoniae FASII produced both saturated and monounsaturated FA when grown in C+Y medium without FA supplement (3Parsons J.B. Frank M.W. Subramanian C. Saenkham P. Rock C.O. Metabolic basis for the differential susceptibility of Gram-positive pathogens to fatty acid synthesis inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The two most abundant PG molecular species had 16:0 paired with either 16:1 or 18:1. S. pneumoniae is like most organisms in that it places saturated FA in the 1-position and unsaturated FA in the 2-position of its membrane phospholipids (13Tatituri R.V. Brenner M.B. Turk J. Hsu F.F. Structural elucidation of diglycosyl diacylglycerol and monoglycosyl diacylglycerol from Streptococcus pneumoniae by multiple-stage linear ion-trap mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization.J.

These data illustrate the difference in membrane phospholipid structures produced by de novo biosynthesis in these two Gram-positive pathogens. Both S. pneumoniae and S. aureus incorporated FA derived from serum lipids when cultured in the presence of human serum. The S. pneumoniae PG molecular species pattern when grown in human serum was different from the pattern obtained in the absence of an exogenous lipid supplement (Fig. 1C). The most abundant peak, m/z = 747, corresponded to a 16:0/18:1 in both growth conditions, and in the presence of human serum the 16:0/16:1 peak was less prominent. This pattern is consistent with the observation that S. pneumoniae shuts down de novo lipid synthesis when supplied with an exogenous source of FA (3Parsons J.B. Frank M.W. Subramanian C. Saenkham P. Rock C.O. Metabolic basis for the differential susceptibility of Gram-positive pathogens to fatty acid synthesis inhibitors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108 (21876172): 15378-1538310.1073/pnas.1109208108Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Peaks in the spectrum arising from the synthesis of molecular species containing 18:2 are highlighted in red (Fig. 1C). A major new peak (m/z = 745) was fragmented to verify that 16:0/18:2 was the most abundant molecular species at this mass position (Fig. 1C, inset). S. pneumoniae cannot make 18:2, thus this FA must be derived from the human serum. The origin of the saturated and monounsaturated FA in PG cannot be unambiguously determined in this experiment because these FA are synthesized by S. pneumoniae and are present in human serum. The analysis of S. aureus grown with human serum showed that most PG molecular species still contained 15:0, but that 18:1 along with its elongation product 20:1 were incorporated from the serum (Fig. 1D). Human serum contains nonesterified FA plus an abundance of glycerolipids, and both S. aureus (geh and lip) (14Delekta P.C. Shook J.C. Lydic T.A. Mulks M.H. Hammer N.D. Staphylococcus aureus utilizes host-derived lipoprotein particles as sources of exogenous fatty acids.J.

Suhkneung Pyo Briles D.E. Rhee D.K. Inhibition of autolysis by lipase LipA in Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis.Mol. Cells. 2017; 40 (29281779): 935-944PubMed Google Scholar) express genes capable of hydrolyzing these lipids to release FA. The three most abundant FA in the human serum sample used in our study were 16:0, 18:1, and 18:2 (Fig. 1E). Although 18:1 and 18:2 were about equal in abundance, S. aureus incorporated significantly more 18:1 than 18:2 (Fig. 1D). The incorporation of 18:2 into PG was significantly less in S. aureus compared with the more robust incorporation of 18:2 into the S. pneumoniae lipidome (Fig. 1F). These data indicated that S. pneumoniae had a higher capacity to extract polyunsaturated FA from human serum than S. aureus. S. aureus expresses two FakB proteins, one specific for saturated FA and the other specific for monounsaturated FA (5Cuypers M.G. Subramanian C. Gullett J.M. Frank M.W. White S.W. Rock C.O. Acyl chain selectivity and physiological roles of Staphylococcus aureus fatty acid-binding proteins.J. Biol.

The fact that S. pneumoniae incorporates 18:2 into its phospholipids suggested that it had a FA-binding protein capable of binding polyunsaturated FA. We identified a single fakA gene (locus tag: Sp0443) and 3 fakB genes (locus tags: Sp1557, Sp1112, Sp0742) in the S. pneumoniae TIGR4 genome. The protein sequences were compared using BLASTP alignment software using the KEGG database sequence entries. The Sp1557 gene was named fakB1 because it encoded a protein that was 35% identical to SaFakB1 and 29% identical to SaFakB2. The Sp1112 gene was named fakB2 because it encoded a protein with 29% identity to SaFakB2 and 28% identity to SaFakB1. The Sp0742 gene encoded a protein that was the least similar to the S. aureus FakBs (18% to SaFakB1 and 26% to SaFakB2), and it was designated fakB3. Both S. pneumoniae and S. aureus are in the phylum Firmicutes and class Bacilli, but S. pneumoniae is in the Order Lactobacillales and S. aureus in the Order Bacillales. Analysis of both Orders using the KEGG database showed that the individual members of both Orders encode between 2 and 4 fakB genes. An experimental system to evaluate the FA selectivities of FA-binding proteins was developed using S. aureus strain JLB31 (ΔfakB1 ΔfakB2) that was unable to incorporate exogenous FA because it lacks FA-binding proteins but expresses the SaFakA kinase domain protein. A series of plasmids were constructed that expressed the individual FakBs governed by the sarA promoter (Table 1). The series of JLB31 strains each harboring a plasmid expressing a particular FakB were grown to an A600 of 0.5 and then a mixture of [d4]16:0, -18:1, and -18:2 (10 μm each) was added to the cultures. After a 30-min incubation, the extent of each FA incorporated into PG was determined by MS (Fig. 2A). The assay was validated using SaFakBs of known FA specificity. The expression of SaFakB1 resulted in robust incorporation of [d4]16:0, whereas the incorporation of the unsaturated FA in the mixture was not detected. In the strain expressing SaFakB2, 18:1 was the most highly incorporated FA, although lower amounts of both [d4]16:0 and -18:2 were detected. Strain JLB31/pCS119 (empty vector) did not express a FakB and did not incorporate any exogenous FA.Table 1Strains, plasmids, and primersDescriptionSourceStrainsAH1263S. aureus strain USA300–0114, Erm-sensitive46Boles B.R.

SpFakB1 supported the incorporation of [d4]16:0, but not 18:1 or 18:2 (Fig. 2A). Oleate (18:1) was the highest incorporated FA in the strain expressing SpFakB2, and more 18:2 was incorporated in the strain expressing SpFakB3 as compared with 18:1 (p = 0.03) or [d4]16:0 (p = 0.001) (Fig. 2A). These data point to SpFakB3 as a binding protein for polyunsaturated FA, and the substrate preferences of SpFakB2 and SpFakB3 were further examined using a mixture of 3 polyunsaturated FA (Fig. 2B). SpFakB2 clearly preferred 18:1, whereas SpFakB3 was less specific in this assay utilizing 18:1, 18:2, and 18:3 although more 18:2 was incorporated as compared with 18:1 (p = 7.0 × 10−4) or 18:3 (p = 2.3 × 10−6) (Fig. 2B). These data suggested that SpFakB3 extends the range of environmental FA that can be incorporated by the FA kinase system to polyunsaturated FA. One potential caveat to the cellular FA selectivity experiment was that incorporation also depended on the action of PlsX and PlsY, which themselves may have acyl chain selectivity that would impact the results. Therefore, SpFakA and the three SpFakBs were expressed and purified to evaluate FA preferences in vitro (Fig. 3A). All four proteins expressed well and were >90% pure judged by gel electrophoresis. Next, the apparent Km for each of the SpFakBs was determined to establish the foundation for the biochemical competition assay (Fig. 3B). SpFakB2 and SpFakB3 had the same apparent Km (0.4 ± 0.09 and 0.5 ± 0.08 μm), whereas the SpFakB1 Km was 2.1 μm ± 0.6. We used a competition assay to evaluate the utilization of FA by the individual SpFakBs (Fig. 4). This assay used a 14C-labeled FA substrate that matched the preferred substrate for each SpFakB: [14C]16:0 for SpFakB1; [14C]18:1 for SpFakB2; and [14C]18:2 for SpFakB3. Unlabeled FA competitors were 80 μm. If the added FA was a substrate for the FA kinase reaction, then the amount of labeled product is reduced. SpFakB1 activity measured with [14C]16:0 was robust, and an excess of cold 16:0 added to the reaction significantly diminished labeled [14C]16:0-phosphate formation. When an excess of either 18:1 or 18:2 was added, there was no change in the utilization of [14C]16:0 indicating that these FA are poor substrates for SpFakB1 (Fig. 4A). The activity of SpFakB2 measured with [14C]18:1 was effectively competed with 18:1, but not with 16:0 (Fig. 4B). The addition of 18:2 decreased the conversion of [14C]18:1-phosphate indicating that 18:2 exchanged onto SpFakB2, but the amount of [14C]18:1-phosphate was not significantly different from the control (Fig. 4B). FA kinase activity with SpFakB3 using [14C]18:2 as a substrate was not decreased by 16:0. Both 18:1 and 18:2 were effective competitors but statistically more [14C]18:2-phosphate remained when cold 18:1 was used as compared with when cold 18:2 was used (p = 0.002) meaning that 18:2 was a better substrate for SpFakB3 (Fig. 4C). The range of FA competitors was extended to other polyunsaturated FA (18:3 and 20:4) (Fig. 4D). These experiments showed that SpFakB3 utilized a broad spectrum of unsaturated FA but showed a statistically significant preference for 18:2 over 18:1 (p = 0.02), 18:3 (p = 0.01), or 20:4 (p = 2.7 × 10−4) (Fig. 4D). The physiological role of fakB3 in S. pneumoniae FA uptake was evaluated by constructing a ΔfakB3 knockout strain. Strain JMG1 (ΔfakB3) was constructed from strain TIGR4 by allelic replacement with a cassette encoding kanamycin resistance (Fig. 5A). PCR analysis showed the presence of the knockout allele and the absence of the fakB3 gene in strain JMG1. The PG molecular species of strain JMG1 (ΔfakB3) was indistinguishable from TIGR4 (WT) when grown in C+Y (Figs. 1A and 5B) but TIGR4 incorporated more 18:2 than strain JMG1 (ΔfakB3) when grown in human serum (Figs. 1C and 5C). The incorporation of 18:2 was restored to WT levels in the complemented strain JMG1/pSpFakB3 (Fig. 5D). These data validate a role for SpFakB3 in the utilization of exogenous 18:2 for membrane lipid synthesis in S. pneumoniae. The basis for the FA preferences of the SpFakB proteins was revealed by the crystal structures of the three S. pneumoniae FA-binding proteins"

However young peoples’ perspectives on using different technologies to detect deteriorating mental health in those already diagnosed with a mental health condition is lacking. The study aim was to explore the perspectives of young patients on the feasibility and acceptability of using wearables, social media and technologies to detect mental health deterioration. Methods The study was co-produced with young adults with past mental health difficulties. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with young adults with a severe mental health condition in a private room at a community mental health site. Data was triangulated by comparing codes and ideas across the two co-researchers and two researchers over two virtual meetings. Themes were finalised and presented in a thematic map. Results Sixteen participants were interviewed (81% female). There were four main themes: dealing with mental health symptoms, signs of mental health deterioration, technology concerns and technological applications to identify worsening mental health. Wearables and mobile apps were considered acceptable and feasible to detect mental health deterioration in real-time if they could measure changes in sleep patterns, mood or activity levels as signs of deterioration. Getting help earlier was deemed essential particularly in reference to dissatisfaction with the current non-technological mental health services. However, patients identified issues to consider before implementation including practicality, safeguarding and patient preference. Conclusion Wearables and mobile apps could be viable technological options to help detect deterioration in young people in order to intervene early and avoid delay in accessing mental health services. However, immediate action following detection is required for the patient to trust and use the intervention."

Our objective was to determine whether NSAIDs use is associated with decreased risk of AD mortality. In this prospective, population-based study (Neurological Disorders in Central Spain [NEDICES]) of 5,072 people without AD (aged 65 years and older), sociodemographic, comorbidity factors, and current medications were recorded at baseline. Community-dwelling older adults were followed for a median of 12.7 years, after which the death certificates of deceased participants were examined. 2,672 (52.7%) of 5,072 participants died, including 504 (18.9%) NSAIDs users and 2,168 (81.1%) non-users. Of the 2,672 deceased participants, 113 (4.2%) had AD as a cause of death (8 [1.6%] among NSAIDs users and 105 [4.8%] among non-users, chi-square = 10.70, p = 0.001). In an unadjusted Cox model, risk of AD mortality was decreased in NSAIDs users (hazard ratio [HR] for AD mortality = 0.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17–0.72, p = 0.004) when compared to non-users. After adjusting for numerous demographic factors and co-morbidities, the HR for AD mortality in NSAIDs users was 0.29, 95% CI 0.12–0.73, p = 0.009. Stratified analyses showed a significantly decreased risk of AD mortality with aspirin, whereas non-aspirin NSAIDs only showed a statistical trend toward significance in the adjusted Cox regression models. NSAIDs use was associated with 71% decreased risk of AD mortality in older adults. Our results support the hypothesis that NSAIDs use is a protective factor of developing AD."
https://openalex.org/W2974269991,"The role of mitochondria in cancer continues to be debated and paradoxically implicated in opposing functions in tumor growth and tumor suppression. To understand this dichotomy, we explored the function of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)2, a tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme mutated in subsets of acute leukemias and gliomas, in cancer. Silencing of IDH2 in prostate cancer cells impaired oxidative bioenergetics, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promoted exaggerated mitochondrial dynamics. This was associated with increased subcellular mitochondrial trafficking, turnover of membrane focal adhesion complexes, and enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion, without changes in cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, loss of IDH2 caused ROS-dependent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in normoxia, which was required for increased mitochondrial trafficking and tumor cell movements. Therefore, IDH2 is a dual regulator of cancer bioenergetics and tumor cell motility. This pathway may reprogram mitochondrial dynamics to differentially adjust energy production or promote tumor cell invasion in response to microenvironment conditions.-Wang, Y., Agarwal, E., Bertolini, I., Ghosh, J.

https://openalex.org/W2974908773,"Extinction-based procedures are often used to inhibit maladaptive fear responses. However, because extinction procedures show efficacy limitations, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been suggested as a promising add-on enhancer.In this study, we tested how cathodal tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affects extinction and tried to unveil the processes at play that boost the effectiveness of extinction procedures and its translational potential to the treatment of anxiety disorders.We implemented a fear conditioning paradigm whereby 41 healthy women (mean age = 20.51 ± 5.0) were assigned to either cathodal tDCS (n = 27) or sham tDCS (n = 16). Fear responses were measured with self-reports, autonomic responses, and implicit avoidance tendencies.Cathodal tDCS shows no statistically significant effect in extinction, according to self-reports, and seems to even negatively affect fear conditioned skin conductance responses. However, one to three months after the tDCS session and extinction, we found a group difference in the action tendencies towards the neutral stimuli (F (1, 41) = 12.04, p = .001, ηp2 = .227), with the cathodal tDCS group (as opposed to the sham group) showing a safety learning (a positive bias towards the CS-), with a moderate effect size. This suggests that cathodal tDCS may foster stimuli discrimination, leading to a decreased generalization effect.Cathodal tDCS may have enhanced long-term distinctiveness between threatening cues and perceptively similar neutral cues through a disambiguation process of the value of the neutral stimuli-a therapeutic target in anxiety disorders. Future studies should confirm these results and extend the study of cathodal tDCS effect on short term avoidance tendencies."

These processes can be biased by different ligands or mutations in the AGTR1 gene. As for many GPCRs, the exact details for AT1R–β-arr interactions driven by AngII or β-arr–biased ligands remain largely unknown. Here, we used the amber-suppression technology to site-specifically introduce the unnatural amino acid (UAA) p-azido-l-phenylalanine (azF) into the intracellular loops (ICLs) and the C-tail of AT1R. Our goal was to generate competent photoreactive receptors that can be cross-linked to β-arrs in cells. We performed UV-mediated photolysis of 25 different azF-labeled AT1Rs to cross-link β-arr1 to AngII-bound receptors, enabling us to map important contact sites in the C-tail and in the ICL2 and ICL3 of the receptor. The extent of AT1R–β-arr1 cross-linking among azF-labeled receptors differed, revealing variability in β-arr's contact mode with the different AT1R domains. Moreover, the signature of ligated AT1R–β-arr complexes from a subset of azF-labeled receptors also differed between AngII and β-arr–biased ligand stimulation of receptors and between azF-labeled AT1R bearing and that lacking a bias signaling mutation. These observations further implied distinct interaction modalities of the AT1R–β-arr1 complex in biased signaling conditions. Our findings demonstrate that this photocross-linking approach is useful for understanding GPCR–β-arr complexes in different activation states and could be extended to study other protein–protein interactions in cells.

Here, we used the amber-suppression technology to site-specifically introduce the unnatural amino acid (UAA) p-azido-l-phenylalanine (azF) into the intracellular loops (ICLs) and the C-tail of AT1R. Our goal was to generate competent photoreactive receptors that can be cross-linked to β-arrs in cells. We performed UV-mediated photolysis of 25 different azF-labeled AT1Rs to cross-link β-arr1 to AngII-bound receptors, enabling us to map important contact sites in the C-tail and in the ICL2 and ICL3 of the receptor. The extent of AT1R–β-arr1 cross-linking among azF-labeled receptors differed, revealing variability in β-arr's contact mode with the different AT1R domains. Moreover, the signature of ligated AT1R–β-arr complexes from a subset of azF-labeled receptors also differed between AngII and β-arr–biased ligand stimulation of receptors and between azF-labeled AT1R bearing and that lacking a bias signaling mutation. These observations further implied distinct interaction modalities of the AT1R–β-arr1 complex in biased signaling conditions. Our findings demonstrate that this photocross-linking approach is useful for understanding GPCR–β-arr complexes in different activation states and could be extended to study other protein–protein interactions in cells.

Agonist-bound GPCRs interact with heterotrimeric G proteins to transduce signals and are subsequently desensitized following receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases (GRKs). GRKs enhance the binding of arrestin proteins to receptors, including the visual arrestin interaction to rhodopsin, and the binding of the two nonvisual arrestins, also known as β-arrestins (β-arrs) 1 and 2, to nonvisual GPCRs, leading to a reduction in G protein–dependent signaling at the plasma membrane (1Pierce K.L.

In addition to this classical role, β-arrs promote internalization of receptors and act as signal transducers where the GPCR–β-arr complex serves as a scaffold to recruit other signaling effectors (4Shukla A.K.

The angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R), a member of the GPCR family, binds β-arrs with high affinity and forms long-lived complexes in cells. β-Arrs interact with AngII-bound receptors' C-tails, which have previously been phosphorylated on specific serine/threonine clusters (6Oakley R.H.

Despite many years of research on the mechanisms of GPCR activation and on the functions of the receptor–β-arr complex in cells, little is known about the details of the complex formation following ligand-mediated activation of receptors. This is in part due to the paucity of structural information due to inherent difficulties in obtaining homogenous and/or stable in vitro ligand–GPCR–β-arr complexes. Moreover, once engaged by ligands, the receptor–β-arr complex adopts different conformations and arrangements. So far, only a complex of rhodopsin bound to visual arrestin has been crystalized with high resolution (17Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O. Han G.W.

Nonetheless, other approaches, such as negative-stain EM combined with the use of a chimeric GPCR, have proposed distinct conformational arrangements of β-arr binding to the receptor (18Shukla A.K.

In addition to this tail interaction, β-arr interacts with the intracellular core domains within the receptor to form a “fully engaged” complex (18Shukla A.K. Westfield G.H. Xiao K. Reis R.I.

A similar core arrangement has also been reported in the structure of the rhodopsin–visual arrestin complex (17Kang Y. Zhou X.E. Gao X. He Y. Liu W. Ishchenko A. Barty A. White T.A. Yefanov O.

These approaches provided valuable insights for arrestins' engagement with receptors, but the precise determinants for arrestins' interaction with the C-tail (other than the already identified phosphorylation sites) and/or the core domain of receptors (i.e. ICLs and TMs), especially in the context of a native cellular environment, need to be further explored. Moreover, because biased ligands and mutations within the receptor affect GPCR–β-arr complex conformations (21Reyes-Alcaraz A. Lee Y.-N Yun S. Hwang J.-I Seong J.Y.

In these cases, receptors containing amber substitutions at distinct sites in their sequences are expressed along with an engineered suppressor tRNACUA and a specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) in cells, which are subsequently supplemented with the UAA to incorporate the photoactivable residue in receptors. UV-mediated photolysis of azF-incorporated mutant receptors allows insertion of nitrene into primary amines or aliphatic hydrogens of interacting partners lying within close proximity (i.e. in the radius of 3–4 Å), enabling different complex cross-linking formations and the identification of important contact sites between receptors and ligands (32Liu W. Brock A. Chen S. Chen S. Schultz P.G. Genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins in mammalian cells.Nat.

Here, we used UAA mutagenesis of AT1R with the photoactive azF inserted at various positions in the receptor to map the residues in AngII-bound AT1R involved in β-arr binding. We investigated the effects of two β-arr–biased ligands, DVG and TRV027, and a biased signaling mutation in AT1R on the photolabeling patterns of the AT1R–β-arr complexes from different vantage points. Our study revealed important intermolecular contact points between β-arr and AT1R located not only in the C-tail but also in the ICLs of the receptor. In addition, we show differences in the interaction of β-arr with certain residues in AT1R in response to AngII versus biased ligands and an AT1R biased signaling variant, suggesting that such a targeted photocross-linking approach can be used to study the conformational arrangement of receptor–β-arr complexes in cells. To uncover the binding sites of β-arr on AT1R, we labeled receptors that were expressed in HEK293T cells via site-specific incorporation of the photoreactive UAA azF (Fig. 1A) through introduction of amber (i.e. stop) codon mutations in AT1R at different sites. We used AT1R fused to RlucII in its C terminus, which was shown to be functional (15Devost D. Sleno R. Pétrin D. Zhang A. Shinjo Y. Okde R. Aoki J. Inoue A. Hébert T.E.

We validated that receptors were fully translated only in the presence of azF through detection of the C-terminal RlucII epitope (Fig. 1C). Receptors were detected in total cell lysates in the presence of azF as shown by a broad band migrating between 75 and 100 kDa, which represents the full-length, glycosylated form of AT1R-RlucII (Fig. 1C). Quantification of receptor revealed that azF-incorporated receptors were expressed to comparable levels as the WT-AT1R except for F309azF, which showed significant increased expression, whereas I238azF, A277azF, and V358azF showed significant decreased expression (Fig. 1C). Of the 25 mutants, only G306azF-AT1R could not be detected. In all other cases, full-length amber mutant receptors were detected only in the presence of azF supplementation, indicating efficient amber codon suppression at various targeted sites and UAA incorporation in these receptor mutants. We next verified the functionality of the different azF-incorporated AT1Rs by assessing β-arr recruitment to receptors upon AngII stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2973526025,"Background Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are debilitating events and spur disease progression. Infectious causes are frequent; however, it is unknown to what extent exacerbations are caused by larger shifts in the airways’ microbiota. The aim of the current study was to analyse the changes in microbial composition between stable state and during exacerbations, and the corresponding immune response. Methods The study sample included 36 COPD patients examined at stable state and exacerbation from the Bergen COPD Cohort and Exacerbations studies, and one patient who delivered sputum on 13 different occasions during the three-year study period. A physician examined the patients at all time points, and sputum induction was performed by stringent protocol. Only induced sputum samples were used in the current study, not spontaneously expectorated sputum. Sputum inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, IP-10, MIG, TNF-α) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs, i.e. LL-37/hCAP-18, SLPI) were measured in supernatants, whereas target gene sequencing (16S rRNA) was performed on corresponding cell pellets. The microbiome bioinformatics platform QIIME2TM and the statistics environment R were applied for bioinformatics analyses. Results Levels of IP-10, MIG, TNF-α and AMPs were significantly different between the two disease states. Of 36 sample pairs, 24 had significant differences in the 12 most abundant genera between disease states. The diversity was significantly different in several individuals, but not when data was analysed on a group level. The one patient case study showed longitudinal dynamics in microbiota unrelated to disease state. Conclusion Changes in the sputum microbiota with changing COPD disease states are common, and are accompanied by changes in inflammatory markers. However, the changes are highly individual and heterogeneous events."
https://openalex.org/W2974389162,"Manure from animals that have been treated with antibiotics is often used to fertilize agricultural soils and its application has previously been shown to enrich for genes associated with antibiotic resistance in agroecosystems. To investigate the magnitude of this effect, we designed a column experiment simulating manure-treated agricultural soil that utilizes artificial subsurface drainage to determine the duration and extent which this type of manure fertilization impacts the set of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in drainage water. We classified ARGs in manure-treated drainage effluent water by its source of origin. Overall, we found that 61% and 7% of the total abundance of ARGs found in drainage water samples could be attributed to manure enrichment and manure addition, respectively. Among these ARGs, we identified 75 genes unique to manure that persisted in both soil and drainage water throughout a drainage season typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. While most of these genes gradually decreased in abundance over time, the IS6100-associated tet(33) gene accrued. These results demonstrate the influence of manure applications on the composition of the resistome observed in agricultural drainage water and highlight the importance of anthropogenic ARGs in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2974747177,"We investigate conditional specifications of the five-factor Fama-French (FF) model, augmented with traditional illiquidity measures. The motivation for this time-varying methodology is that the traditional static approach of the FF model may be misspecified, especially for the endogenous illiquidity measures. We focus on the time-varying nature of the Jensen performance measure α and the market systematic risk sensitivity β, as these parameters are essentially universal in asset pricing models. To tackle endogeneity and other specification errors, we rely on our robust instrumental variables (RIV) algorithm implemented via a GMM approach. In this dynamic or time-varying conditional context, we generally find that the most significant factor is the market one, but illiquidity may matter depending on which states or estimation methods we consider. In particular, sectors whose returns embed a market illiquidity premium are more exposed to a binding funding constraint in times of crisis, which leads to deleveraging and a resulting decrease in systematic risk."
https://openalex.org/W2974200111,"This study investigated whether stress responsiveness (in one context) can be used to predict dog behavior in daily life. On two occasions (NT1 = 32 puppies; NT2 = 16 young adults), dogs’ physiological stress response after a behavioral test at home was measured in terms of reactivity (10 min post-test) and recovery (40 min post-test) for three salivary markers: cortisol, chromogranin A (CgA) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). For each marker, it was determined whether dogs with a strong physiological response displayed different behavior in daily life compared to dogs with a weaker physiological response. The results revealed three main findings: first, for CgA and cortisol, different patterns were identified according to sample time. High reactivity related to desirable traits, whereas slow recovery after the behavioral test related to undesirable traits. The findings suggest that increased levels of CgA and cortisol 10 minutes after the behavioral test reflected an adaptive stress response, whereas elevated levels 40 minutes after the test reflected unsuccessful coping. Second, patterns for sIgA differed from CgA and cortisol: significant associations were only found with behavioral traits at T2, mostly considered desirable and related to Trainability. Possibly, the delayed reaction pattern of sIgA caused this difference between markers, as sIgA reflects the (secondary) immune response to stress, due to immunosuppressive effects of cortisol. Third, predictive capacity of puppies’ physiological stress response (T1) was inconclusive, and contrary relations were found with behavioral traits at T2, suggesting that developmental factors play an important role. This study provides new insights about the relation between stress physiology and behavioral traits, and methodological advice is given to study these patterns further. In conclusion, physiological markers could provide additional insights in dogs’ tendencies to display certain behaviors, especially at the young adult stage. Further studies are needed to confirm these patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2974584811,"Mitochondria are fundamental organelles for cellular and systemic metabolism, and their dysfunction has been implicated in the development of diverse metabolic diseases. Boosted mitochondrial metabolism might be able to protect against metabolic stress and prevent metabolic disorders. Here we show that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDU)‐FAB1, also known as mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, acts as a novel enhancer of mitochondrial metabolism and protects against obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, NDUFAB1 coordinately enhances lipoylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase mediated by the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway and increases the assembly of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. Skeletal muscle‐specific ablation of NDUFAB1 causes systemic disruption of glucose homeostasis and defective insulin signaling, leading to growth arrest and early death within 5 postnatal days. In contrast, NDUFAB1 overexpression effectively protects mice against obesity and insulin resistance when the animals are challenged with a high‐fat diet. Our findings indicate that NDUFAB1 could be a novel mitochondrial target to prevent obesity and insulin resistance by enhancing mitochondrial metabolism.—Zhang, R., Hou, T., Cheng, H., Wang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2974834475,"Patients with stage II or III colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibit various clinical outcomes after radical treatments. The 5-year survival rate was between 50 and 87%. However, the underlying mechanisms of the variation remain unclear. Here we show that AMPKα1 is overexpressed in CRC patient specimens and the high expression is correlated with poor patient survival. We further reveal a previously unrecognized function of AMPKα1, which maintains high level of reduced glutathione to keep reduction-oxidation reaction (redox) homeostasis under stress conditions, thus promoting CRC cell survival under metabolic stress in vitro and enhancing tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, AMPKα1 regulate the glutathione reductase (GSR) phosphorylation possibly through residue Thr507 which enhances its activity. Suppression of AMPKα1 by using nano-sized polymeric vector induces a favorable therapeutic effect, especially when in combination with oxaliplatin. Our study uncovers a novel function of AMPKα1 in redox regulation and identifies a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2974581080,"Abstract The CDK7 inhibitors (CDK7i) ICEC0942 and THZ1, are promising new cancer therapeutics. Resistance to targeted drugs frequently compromises cancer treatment. We sought to identify mechanisms by which cancer cells may become resistant to CDK7i. Resistant lines were established through continuous drug selection. ABC-transporter copy number, expression and activity were examined using real-time PCR, immunoblotting and flow cytometry. Drug responses were measured using growth assays. ABCB1 was upregulated in ICEC0942-resistant cells and there was cross-resistance to THZ1. THZ1-resistant cells upregulated ABCG2 but remained sensitive to ICEC0942. Drug resistance in both cell lines was reversible upon inhibition of ABC-transporters. CDK7i response was altered in adriamycin- and mitoxantrone-resistant cell lines demonstrating ABC-transporter upregulation. ABCB1 expression correlated with ICEC0942 and THZ1 response, and ABCG2 expression with THZ2 response, in a panel of cancer cell lines. We have identified ABCB1 upregulation as a common mechanism of resistance to ICEC0942 and THZ1, and confirmed that ABCG2 upregulation is a mechanism of resistance to THZ1. The identification of potential mechanisms of CDK7i resistance and differences in susceptibility of ICEC0942 and THZ1 to ABC-transporters, may help guide their future clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2974742309,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase (Rca) is a AAA+ enzyme that uses ATP to remove inhibitors from the active site of Rubisco, the central carboxylation enzyme of photosynthesis. Rca α and β isoforms exist in most higher plant species, with the α isoform being identical to the β form but having an additional 25-45 amino acids at the Rca C terminus, known as the C-terminal extension (CTE). Rca is inhibited by ADP, and the extent of ADP sensitivity of the Rca complex can be modulated by the CTE of the α isoform, particularly in relation to a disulfide bond structure that is specifically reduced by the redox-regulatory enzyme thioredoxin-f. Here, we introduced single point mutations of Lys-428 in the CTE of Rca-α from wheat (Triticum aestivum) (TaRca2-α). Substitution of Lys-428 with Arg dramatically altered ADP inhibition, independently of thioredoxin-f regulation. We determined that the reduction in ADP inhibition in the K428R variant is not due to a change in ADP affinity, as the apparent constant for ADP binding was not altered by the K428R substitution. Rather, we observed that the K428R substitution strongly increased ATP substrate affinity and ATP-dependent catalytic velocity. These results suggest that the Lys-428 residue is involved in interacting with the γ-phosphate of ATP. Considering that nucleotide-dependent Rca activity regulates Rubisco and thus photosynthesis during fluctuating irradiance, the K428R substitution could potentially provide a mechanism for boosting the performance of wheat grown in the dynamic light environments of the field."

In the model, patterns of sway result from both instantaneous, passive, mechanical resistance and delayed, intermittent resistance signaled by the central nervous system. A Kalman-Filter framework was designed to directly estimate from experimental data the parameters of the model’s stochastic delay differential equations with discrete dynamic switching conditions. Simulations showed that all parameters could be estimated over a variety of possible data-generating configurations with varying degrees of bias and variance depending on their empirical identification. Applications to experimental data reveal distributions of each parameter that correspond well to previous findings, suggesting that many useful, physiological measures may be extracted from sway data. Individuals varied in degree and type of deviation from theoretical expectations, ranging from harmonic oscillation to non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2974789016,"Breast cancers that express epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (EGFRs) are associated with poor prognosis. Our group recently showed in breast cancer patients that EGFR expression is strongly correlated with high tumor uptake of the glucose analogue, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). Here, we explored the cellular mechanism and signaling pathways that can explain the relation between EGFR and breast cancer cell glucose metabolism. FDG uptake, lactate production and hexokinase (HK) activity were measured, and proliferation assays and western blots were performed. EGF stimulated an increase of FDG uptake in EGFR-positive T47D and MDA-MB-468 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells. In T47D cells, the effect was dose-dependent and was accompanied by increased lactate production, indicating a shift toward glycolytic flux. This metabolic response occurred through enhanced HK activity and upregulated glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression. EGFR stimulation also increased T47D cell proliferation. Blocking EGFR activation with BIBX1382 or gefitinib completely abolished both FDG uptake and proliferation effects. EGFR stimulation induced MAP kinase (MAPK) and PI3 kinase (PI3K) activation. Increased cell proliferation by EGFR stimulation was completely abolished by MAPK inhibition with PD98059 or by PI3K inhibition with LY294002. Increased FDG uptake was also completely abrogated by PI3K inhibition but was uninfluenced by MAPK inhibition. These findings suggest that the association between breast tumor EGFR expression and high FDG uptake might be contributed by stimulation of the PI3K pathway downstream of EGFR activation. This was in contrast to EGFR-mediated cell proliferation that required MAPK as well as PI3K signaling."

The aim of this study is to gain new knowledge that would enable the design of effective of measures that would help prevent suicide by hanging. Methods A total of 6,497 suicides registered across the eight Swiss Forensic Institutes (IRM) were analysed. Of these, 1,282 (19.7%) persons hung themselves. T-test and chi-square tests. and chi-square tests were used to analyse …(or determine, or investigate) …group differences regarding sociodemographic variables and triggers Findings Men and women who hung themselves showed no significant differences in sociodemographic variables. However, women were significantly more likely to have a psychiatric illness history, whereas men were more likely to have somatic diagnoses. In controlled environments, people used shelves, plumbing and windows more often than beams, pipes, bars and hooks to hang themselves. Compared with other suicide methods, hanging was more likely to have been triggered by partner and financial problems. Conclusions Suicide by hanging can be best prevented in institutions (e.g. psychiatric hospitals, somatic hospitals, prisons). These institutions should be structurally evaluated and modified with a primary focus on sanitary areas, windows and shelves. Otherwise, it is important to use general suicide prevention measures, such as awareness raising and staff training in medical settings, low-threshold treatment options and regular suicide risk assessment for people at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2974815673,"The stereotyped floral morphology of Neotropical Malpighiaceae species—zygomorphic and calyx with oil glands—is correlated with oil-bee pollination. In contrast, the floral trends of the Paleotropical lineages are actinomorphy and lack of calyx glands, probably due to the absence of oil-collecting bees. The Paleotropical genus Acridocarpus is an exception because of its zygomorphic, gland-bearing flowers. Glands throughout Acridocarpus inflorescences were morphoanatomically evaluated to verify the occurrence of patterns related to species and geographic distribution. Herbarium (25 species) and fresh samples of A. longifolius were processed according to standard anatomical techniques. To verify the presence of glucose and protein, strip tests were applied to the exudate. Fresh samples were fixed and submitted to histochemical tests. Based on the occurrence, number and placement of glands, three distribution patterns were recognized on the bracteole and ten on the calyx. Bract, bracteole and sepal glands have a typical nectary structure with a palisade-like epidermis and vascularized parenchyma. Glands were classified as short-stalked, sessile or immersed. Histochemical tests performed on bract and sepal glands of A. longifolius were positive for proteins, polysaccharides and phenolic compounds, and negative for oil compounds. Glucose and protein were detected in the exudate. These results allow us to recognize the glands in Acridocarpus inflorescences as nectaries. This comprehensive morphoanatomical study helps to clarify the correlation between patterns of floral morphology and secretion consumers, as well as to better understand floral evolution in Malpighiaceae across their dispersal events."
https://openalex.org/W2974874921,"In the course of the Maillard reaction, which occurs during heating of food but also under physiological condition, a broad spectrum of reaction products is formed. Among them, the advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) Nε-carboxymethyllysine (CML), pyrraline (Pyr), methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (MG-H1) and Nε-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) are the quantitatively dominating compounds during later reaction stages. Those dietary glycation compounds are under discussion as to be associated with chronic inflammation and the pathophysiological consequences of diseases such as diabetes. In the present study, the concentration of individual glycation compounds in saliva was monitored for the first time and related to their dietary uptake. Fasting saliva of 33 metabolically healthy subjects was analyzed with HPLC-MS/MS. The observed levels of individual glycation compounds ranged from 0.5 to 55.2 ng/ml and differed both intra- and interindividually. Patterns did not correlate with subject-related features such as vegetarianism or sports activities, indicating that dietary intake may play an important role. Therefore, six volunteers were asked to eat a raw food diet free of glycation compounds for two days. Within two days, salivary Pyr was lowered from median 1.7 ng/ml to a minimum level below the limit of detection, and MG-H1 decreased from 3.6 to 1.7 ng/ml in in a time-dependent manner after two days. Salivary CML and CEL concentrations were not affected. Therefore, measuring Pyr and MG-H1 in saliva is a suitable diagnostic tool to monitor the dietary intake and metabolic transit of glycation compounds present in heated foods."

Currently, there are no pharmacologic therapies that are effective in inhibiting or preventing PVR formation. One of the key aspects of PVR pathogenesis is retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here we show that the polyether ionophore compound salinomycin (SNC) effectively inhibits TGFβ-induced EMT of RPE cells. SNC blocks the activation of TGFβ-induced downstream targets alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagen 1 (Col1A1). Additionally, SNC inhibits TGFβ-induced RPE cell migration and contraction. We show that SNC functions to inhibit RPE EMT by targeting both the pTAK1/p38 and Smad2 signaling pathways upon TGFβ stimulation. Additionally, SNC is able to inhibit αSMA and Col1A1 expression in RPE cells that have already undergone TGFβ-induced EMT. Together, these results suggest that SNC could be an effective therapeutic compound in both the prevention and treatment of PVR."

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of procalcitonin in decreasing the duration of antibiotic treatment in children after cardiovascular surgery.Prospective, interventional study carried out in a pediatric intensive care unit. Included patients under 18 years old admitted after cardiopulmonary bypass. Two groups were compared, depending on the implementation of the PCT-guided protocol to stop or de-escalate the antibiotic treatment (Group 1, 2011-2013 and group 2, 2014-2018). This new protocol was based on the decrease of the PCT value by 20% or 50% with respect to the maximum value of PCT. Primary endpoints were mortality, stewardship indication, duration of antibiotic treatment, and antibiotic-free days.886 patients were recruited. There were 226 suspicions of infection (25.5%), and they were confirmed in 38 cases (16.8%). The global rate of infections was 4.3%. 102 patients received broad-spectrum antibiotic (4.7±1.7 days in group 1, 3.9±1 days in group 2 with p = 0.160). The rate of de-escalation was higher in group 2 (30/62, 48.4%) than in group 1 (24/92, 26.1%) with p = 0.004. A reduction of 1.1 days of antibiotic treatment (group 1, 7.7±2.2 and group 2, 6.7±2.2, with p = 0.005) and 2 more antibiotic free-days free in PICU in group 2 were observed (p = 0.001), without adverse outcomes.Procalcitonin-guided protocol for stewardship after cardiac surgery seems to be safe and useful to decrease the antibiotic exposure. This protocol could help to reduce the duration of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the duration of antibiotics in total, without developing complications or adverse effects."

Transport of these cargos occurs through association of the BBSome with the IFT-B complex via an interaction with a linker protein LZTFL1 (leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1) that binds to IFT27 in the IFT-B complex (15Eguether T.

In this manner, the BBSome collects membrane proteins for IFT- and dynein-mediated retrograde transport. To perform its transport function, each of the 8 subunits of the BBSome must be translated on ribosomes, folded into their native state and assembled into a functional complex. Evidence suggests that BBSome assembly proceeds through several subcomplexes, with BBS9 acting as a central scaffold. A stable hexameric complex consisting of human BBS1, -4, -5, -8, -9, and -18 was recently isolated from insect cells (21Klink B.U. Zent E. Juneja P. Kuhlee A. Raunser S. Wittinghofer A.

This subcomplex interacted with Arl6 as well as peptide motifs from several G protein–coupled receptor cargos. The two other subunits of the BBSome, BBS2 and BBS7, have an intricate folding and assembly process that requires a network of molecular chaperones, including the cytosolic chaperonin containing tailless polypeptide 1 (CCT; also termed TRiC) complex and three chaperonin-like proteins named BBS6, -10, and -12 (22Seo S.

To better understand the mechanism of BBSome assembly, its function as a scaffold for intraflagellar transport and the molecular basis of BBS disease, we have isolated a trimeric BBSome subcomplex of BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 and investigated its structure by electron microscopy (EM) and chemical cross-linking coupled with MS (XL-MS) using the integrative modeling platform (28Russel D.

The subcomplex between BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 is an important early intermediate in assembly of the BBSome (23Zhang Q. Yu D. Seo S. Stone E.M. Sheffield V.C.

We purified this BBS2-7-9 subcomplex for structural studies by co-expressing affinity-tagged versions of each subunit in HEK-293T cells and isolating complexes containing the Strep peptide-tagged BBS7 using a Strep-Tactin column. This purification resulted in roughly equal amounts of BBS2, BBS7, and BBS9 with a 70-kDa contaminant protein corresponding to heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) isoforms (Fig. 1A). The complex was further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1B), which separated Hsp70 and other contaminants (fractions 3–9 and 15–25) from the subcomplex (fractions 10–13). We assessed the homogeneity of the complex by negative stain EM and found that despite the purity of the preparation, the particles were not sufficiently homogeneous for a high-resolution structural analysis by cryo-EM (Fig. 1, C and D). As a result, we carried out a low-resolution 3D reconstruction using negative-stained EM images (Table S1). The reconstruction (23 Å resolution) revealed the overall structure of the complex (Fig. 1E), which can be described as a flattened, triangular structure with a ∼200 Å height and ∼120 Å width at the base, with a small mass ∼40 Å in diameter protruding from one of the sides. In the absence of high-resolution cryo-EM data, we used the low-resolution EM envelope combined with cross-link MS (XL-MS) to generate a molecular model of the BBS2-7-9 complex. XL-MS has become an effective tool to probe the structural architecture of protein complexes (32Politis A. Stengel F. Hall Z. Hernández H. Leitner A. Walzthoeni T. Robinson C.V. Aebersold R.

Only high confidence hits that satisfied the screening criteria (see “Experimental procedures”) were considered as true cross-links (Tables S2–S4). The coverage was nearly complete with 86 (BBS2), 90 (BBS7), and 87% (BBS9) of all lysine residues reacting with the cross-linking reagents. Of those, 68 (BBS2), 66 (BBS7), and 78% (BBS9) were involved in cross-links, whereas the rest formed monolinks (Table S5). XL-MS generates three types of cross-links that provide different structural information: cross-links within individual domains of the BBSome subunits (intra-domain cross-links), cross-links between domains of the subunits (inter-domain cross-links), and cross-links between subunits (inter-protein cross-links). The XL-MS analysis identified 51 intra-domain cross-links (Fig. 2). These cross-links were used to validate structural models of the individual domains of the core subunits. BBS2, -7, and -9 are homologous proteins that share a well-defined domain organization with N-terminal β-propeller, followed by coiled-coil, γ-adaptin ear (GAE), platform, and C-terminal α-helical domains (11Jin H.

Spartina alterniflora is an invasive plant that is a major threat to the economy and environment of the coastal regions in China. We analyzed the genetic structure and diversity of six populations of S. alterniflora differing in invasion histories in Guangxi, China. A total of 176 individuals from the six populations produced 348 AFLP fragments. The average heterozygosity was significantly lower than in the native population. And genetic bottlenecks were also detected in most populations. Standardized FST statistics (Φpt = 0.015) and AMOVA results indicated weak genetic differentiation. Genetic admixture and obviously isolation by distance indicated populations in Guangxi come from a pre-admixed population by a single introduction. High phenotypic variations of S. alterniflora in Guangxi influenced by soil salinity and temperature might be an important reason for the successful invasion."

This paper not only provided a comprehensive analysis of the accidents of highly aggregated tourist crowds but also determined the occurrence mechanism and coping paths. Based on the analysis of multiple cases, we found that the variable status of highly aggregated tourist crowds was the result of the interaction of three main elements: multisource pressure, state mutations and management responses. A series of factors interact and result in accidents, and the lack of a management response or a low-quality management response is the root cause of such accidents. A high-quality management response is a basic safety precaution for highly aggregated tourist crowds. Therefore, forming a virtuous circle of multisource pressure, state mutations and management responses is an effective path for coping with accidents."
https://openalex.org/W2973655530,"Background The application of artificial tears before performing perimetry can improve the reliability and results of perimetry in patients with glaucoma and dry eye (DE). However, the effects of ocular surface and tear film conditions on perimetry measurements and reliability have not been fully characterized. Methods This prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study investigated tear metrics in perimetry and assessed the relationships that existed among ocular surface condition, tear condition, and perimetry reliability. Forty-three eyes (43 patients) with DE disease according to the 2016 Japanese diagnostic criteria of DE and 43 eyes (43 subjects) of age- and visual field mean deviation-matched normal control subjects were studied. Perimetry was performed using the Humphrey Field Analyzer (30–2 SITA-Standard). Schirmer’s test, strip meniscometry value, blink rate, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), fluorescein staining of ocular surface, and Dry Eye-related Quality of Life Score (DEQS) were measured. Blink rate was re-measured during perimetry. TFBUT and fluorescein staining were re-evaluated after perimetry. Perimetry reliability was evaluated with fixation loss, false-positive, and false-negative rates. Results Blink rate during perimetry was significantly lower for both patients with DE and normal controls (both P<0.001). TFBUT after perimetry was significantly higher than before perimetry in patients with DE (P<0.001). Fluorescein staining of ocular surface was significantly increased in patients with DE and normal control subjects (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). Spearman correlation analysis revealed that blink rate during perimetry was negatively correlated with fixation-loss rate (r = -0.393, P = 0.009) in patients with DE. Conclusions Performing perimetry was associated with a significant change in tear condition and ocular surface condition in both patients with DE and normal control subjects. The changes in tear condition and ocular surface condition may impact the reliability of perimetry in patients with DE."
https://openalex.org/W2974056285,"An empirical question of long-standing interest is how price promotions affect a brand's sale shares in the fast-moving consumer-goods market. We investigated this question with concurrent promotions and sales records of specialty beer brands pooled over Tesco stores in the UK. Most brands were continuously promoted, rendering infeasible a conventional approach of establishing impact against an off-promotion sales baseline, and arguing in favor of a dynamics approach. Moreover, promotion/sales records were volatile without easily-discernable regularity. Past work conventionally attributed volatility to the impact of exogenous random shocks on stable markets, and reasoned that promotions have only an ephemeral impact on sales shares in stationary mean-reverting stochastic markets, or a persistent freely-wandering impact in nonstationary markets. We applied new empirical methods from the applied sciences to uncover an overlooked alternative: 'systematic persistence' in which promotional impacts evolve systematically in an endogenously-unstable market governed by deterministic-nonlinear dynamics. We reconstructed real-world market dynamics from the Tesco dataset, and detected deterministic-nonlinear market dynamics. We used reconstructed market dynamics to identify a complex network of systematic interactions between promotions and sales shares among competing brands, and quantified/characterized the dynamics of these interactions. For the majority of weeks in the study, we found that: (1) A brand's promotions drove down own sales shares (a possibility recognized in the literature), but 'cannibalized' sales shares of competing brands (perhaps explaining why brands were promoted despite a negative marginal impact on own sales shares); and (2) Competitive interactions between brands owned by the same multinational brewery differed from those with outside brands. In particular, brands owned by the same brewery enjoyed a 'mutually-beneficial' relationship in which an incremental increase in the sales share of one marginally increased the sales share of the other. Alternatively, the sales shares of brands owned by different breweries preyed on each other's market shares."

The present sub-study compared selected leukocyte subpopulations in the circulation and bone marrow after polytrauma in BALB/c versus CD-1 mice. Animals underwent unilateral femur fracture, splenectomy and hemorrhagic shock. We collected blood and bone marrow for flow cytometry analysis at 24h and 48h post-trauma. Circulating granulocytes (Ly6G+CD11+) increased in both strains after trauma. Only in BALB/c mice circulating CD8+ T-lymphocytes decreased within 48h by 30%. Regulatory T-cells (Tregs, CD4+CD25+CD127low) increased in both strains by approx. 32%. Circulating Tregs and lymphocytes (CD11b-Ly6G-MHC-2+) were always at least 1.5-fold higher in BALB/c, while the bone marrow MHC-2 expression decreased in CD-1 mice (p<0.05). Overall, immune responses to polytrauma were similar in both strains. Additionally, BALB/c expressed higher level of circulating regulatory T-cells and MHC-2-positive lymphocytes compared to CD-1 mice."

Safety information during repeated treatment with the same drug is scarce. We report safety data from the Quinact randomized clinical trial (RCT) that was designed to assess efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and quinine+clindamycin (QnC).Males and females aged 12 to 59 months with uncomplicated malaria were treated with ASAQ and followed up during 42 days (preRCT). Clinical failures were randomized to one of the 3 treatments and followed up for 28 days (RCT). Subsequent failures were repeatedly treated with ASAQ several times as needed (postRCT1, postRCT2 and so on) until a 28-days follow up period without parasitaemia.Eight hundred and sixty-five, 242 and 64 patients were recruited respectively in preRCT, RCT and postRCTs. In preRCT, 433 (50.0%) patients experienced at least one drug-related adverse event (AE). The most reported AEs were anorexia (22.9%), asthenia (19.4%), and abnormal behavior (14.6%). Twenty-nine AEs (3.5%) were reported to be severe. In RCT, at least one drug-related AE was reported in 54.7%, 21.5% and 40.0% of patient randomized respectively to ASAQ, AL and QnC (p<0.001). During postRCT1 (n = 64), postRCT 2 (n = 17) and postRCT3 (n = 7), respectively 32.8%, 35.3% and 71.4% of patients experienced at least one drug-related AE. Three serious adverse events occurred but not judged related to study medication.The proportion of AEs did not increase over the treatment courses with ASAQ.

https://openalex.org/W2973409540,"Mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (TB), a cattle disease of global importance. M. bovis infects bovine macrophages (Mø) and subverts the host cell response to generate a suitable niche for survival and replication. We investigated the role of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 10 during in vitro infection of bovine monocyte-derived Mø (bMDM) with two divergent UK strains of M. bovis, which differentially modulate expression of IL10. The use of IL10-targeting siRNA revealed that IL10 inhibited the production of IL1B, IL6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFNG) during infection of bMDM with the M. bovis strain G18. In contrast, IL10 only regulated a subset of these genes; TNF and IFNG, during infection with the M. bovis reference strain AF2122/97. Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) production was modulated by IL10 during AF2122/97 infection, but not at the nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) mRNA level, as observed during G18 infection. However, IL10 was found to promote survival of both M. bovis strains during early bMDM infection, but this effect disappeared after 24 h. The role of IL10-induced modulation of TNF, IFNG and NO production in M. bovis survival was investigated using siRNA targeting TNF, IFNG receptor 1 (IFNGR1) and NOS2. Knock-down of these genes individually did not promote survival of either M. bovis strain and therefore modulation of these genes does not account for the effect of IL10 on M. bovis survival. However, TNF knock-down was found to be detrimental to the survival of the M. bovis strain G18 during early infection. The results provide further evidence for the importance of IL10 during M. bovis infection of Mø. Furthermore, they highlight M. bovis strain specific differences in the interaction with the infected bMDM, which may influence the course of infection and progression of bovine TB."
https://openalex.org/W2973559487,"Previous studies have demonstrated cardiac and vascular remodeling induced by microgravity exposure. Yet, as the most important branch of vasculatures circulating the heart, the coronary artery has been seldomly studied about its adaptations under microgravity conditions. Large‐conductance Ca 2+ ‐activated potassium channel (BK Ca ) and the Ras homolog family member A (RhoA)/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway play key roles in control of vascular tone and mediation of microgravity‐induced vascular adjustments. Therefore, we investigated the adaptation of coronary vasoreactivity to simulated microgravity and the role of BK Ca and the RhoA/ROCK pathway in it. Four‐week‐old hind‐limb unweighted (HU) rats were adopted to simulate effects of microgravity. Right coronary artery (RCA) constriction was measured by isometric force recording. The activity and expression of BK Ca and the RhoA/ROCK pathway were examined by Western blot, patch‐clamp recordings, and immunoprecipitation. We found HU significantly decreased RCA vasoconstriction to KCl, serotonin, and U‐46619, but increased protein expression and current densities of BK Ca , inhibition of which by iberiotoxin (IBTX) further decreased RCA vasoconstriction ( P &lt; 0.05). Expression of RhoA and ROCK as well as active RhoA and phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) at Ser 19 and MLC phosphatase target‐1 at Thr 696 were significantly increased by HU, and ROCK inhibitor Y‐27632 exerted greater suppressing effect on HU RCA vasoconstriction than that of control ( P &lt; 0.05). BK Ca opener NS1619 increased HU RCA vasoconstriction, which was blocked by both RhoA and ROCK inhibitor, similar to the effect of IBTX. These results indicate that HU impairs coronary vasoconstriction but enhances BK Ca activity acting as a protective mechanism avoiding excessive decrease of coronary vasoreactivity through activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway.—Wu, Y., Yue, Z., Wang Q., Lv, Q., Liu, H., Bai, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2973586138,"Interactive conversation drives the transmission of cultural information in small groups and large networks. In formal (e.g. schools) and informal (e.g. home) learning settings, interactivity does not only allow individuals and groups to faithfully transmit and learn new knowledge and skills, but also to boost cumulative cultural evolution. Here we investigate how interactivity affects performance, teaching, learning, innovation and chosen diffusion mode (e.g. instructional discourse vs. storytelling) of previously acquired information in a transmission chain experiment. In our experiment, participants (n = 288) working in 48 chains with three generations of pairs had to learn and complete a collaborative food preparation task (ravioli-making), and then transmit their experience to a new generation of participants in an interactive and non-interactive condition. Food preparation is a real-world task that it is taught and learned across cultures and transmitted over generations in families and groups. Pairs were defined as teachers or learners depending on their role in the transmission chain. The number of good exemplars of ravioli each pair produced was taken as measurement of performance. Contrary to our expectations, the results did not reveal that (1) performance increased over generations or that (2) interactivity in transmission sessions promoted increased performance. However, the results showed that (3) interactivity promoted the transmission of more information from teachers to learners; (4) increased quantity of information transmission from teachers led to higher performance in learners; (5) higher performance generations introduced more innovations in transmission sessions; (6) learners applied those transmitted innovations to their performance which made them persist over generations; (7) storytelling was specialized for the transmission of non-routine, unexpected information. Our findings offer new insights on how interactivity, innovation and storytelling affect the cultural transmission of complex collaborative tasks."

We investigated its impact on the timing of liver transplantation (LT) in patients with genotype 1b HCV cirrhosis. Methods We genotyped and evaluated 172 LT candidates with liver cirrhosis owing to chronic HCV infection, genotype 1b. One hundred patients needed LT for chronic liver failure (CLF) and 72 for a small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the cirrhotic liver without CLF. Population controls (n = 647) were selected from the Czech cross-sectional study MONICA. Results The CLF patients were younger (53.5 ± 7.2 vs. 59.6 ± 6.6, P < 0.001) with more advanced liver disease than HCC patients (Child-Pugh’s score 9.1 ± 1.8 vs. 7.1 ± 1.9, P < 0.001, MELD 14.1 ± 3.9 vs. 11.1 ± 3.7, P < 0.001). PNPLA3 G allele increased the risk of LT for CLF in both allelic and recessive models (CG + GG vs. CC: OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.017–3.472, P = 0.045 and GG vs. CC + CG: OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.032–7.513, P = 0.042). Multivariate analysis identified younger age (P < 0.001) and the G allele (P < 0.05) as risk factors for CLF. The genotype frequencies between the CLF group and MONICA study significantly differed in both, allelic and recessive model (P = 0.004, OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.222–2.875; P < 0.001, OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.824–6.084, respectively). The OR values almost doubled in the recessive model compared with the allelic model suggesting the additive effect of allele G. In contrast, genotype frequencies in the HCC group were similar to the MONICA study in both models. Pretransplant viral load was significantly lower in GG than in CC + CG genotypes (median, IQR; 162,500 (61,550–319,000) IU/ml vs. 570,000 (172,000–1,595,000) IU/ml, P < 0.0009). Conclusions Our results suggest that PNPLA3 rs738409 G allele carriage may be associated with a faster progression of HCV cirrhosis to chronic liver failure."

Among these, a number of populations of the kōwhai psyllid Psylla apicalis (Ferris & Klyver, 1932), from a kōwhai species, Sophora microphylla Aiton (Fabaceae), presented high genetic variability. This gave new endorsement of an 87-year-old observation made by the entomologists Ferris and Klyver who, when describing the kōwhai psyllid, from Sophora tetraptera J.S. Muell., suggested that morphological variations could support more than one species. Accordingly, the morphological assessment conducted here, together with the genetic information now available, resulted in the description of Psylla frodobagginsi sp. nov. as a second New Zealand endemic psyllid species hosted by S. microphylla."
https://openalex.org/W2973969703,"One approach to improving antibiotic stewardship in primary care may be to support all General Practitioners (GPs) to have access to point of care C-Reactive Protein tests to guide their prescribing decisions in patients presenting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. However, to date there has been no work to understand how clinical commissioning groups might approach the practicalities of system-wide implementation. We aimed to develop an accessible service delivery modelling tool that, based on open data, could generate a layout of the geographical distribution of point of care facilities that minimised the cost and travel distance for patients across a given region. We considered different implementation models where point of care tests were placed at either GP surgeries, pharmacies or both. We analysed the trade-offs between cost and travel found by running the model under different configurations and analysing the model results in four regions of England (two urban, two rural). Our model suggests that even under assumptions of short travel distances for patients (e.g. under 500m), it is possible to achieve a meaningful reduction in the number of necessary point of care testing facilities to serve a region by referring some patients to be tested at nearby GP surgeries or pharmacies. In our test cases pharmacy-led implementation models resulted in some patients having to travel long distances to obtain a test, beyond the desired travel limits. These results indicate that an efficient implementation strategy for point of care tests over a geographic region, potentially building on primary care networks, might lead to significant cost reduction in equipment and associated personnel training, maintenance and quality control costs; as well as achieving fair access to testing facilities."
https://openalex.org/W2974390134,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is characterized by the accumulation of Langerin (CD207)-expressing histiocytes. Mutational activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway genes, in particular BRAF, drives most cases. To test whether activated BRAF is sufficient for the development of LCH, we engineered mice to express BRAF V600E under the control of the human Langerin promoter. These mice have shortened survivals, smaller lymphoid organs, absent Leydig cells, and fewer epidermal LCs than controls, but do not accumulate histiocytes. To test whether the absence of histiocyte proliferation could be due to oncogene-induced senescence, we engineered homozygous Pten loss in the same cells that expressed BRAF V600E. Like mice with intact Pten, these mice have shortened survivals, smaller thymi, and absent Leydig cells. However, loss of Pten also leads to the accumulation of CD207+ histiocytes in spleen, thymus, and some lymph nodes. While many CD207+ histiocytes in the thymus are CD8-, reminiscent of LCH cells, the CD207+ histiocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes are CD8+. These mice also accumulate large numbers of CD207- cells in the lamina propria (LP) of the small intestine. Both the lymphoid and LP phenotypes are likely due to human Langerin promoter-driven BRAF V600E expression in resident CD8+ dendritic cells in the former and LP dendritic cells in the latter and confirm that Pten loss is required to overcome inhibitory pathways induced by BRAF V600E expression. The complex phenotype of these mice is a consequence of the multiple murine cell types in which the human Langerin promoter is active."
https://openalex.org/W2973936129,"In a retrospective cohort study, we report the current epidemiology of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and analyze the real-world clinical outcomes of bortezomib-based therapy.This retrospective study was mainly designed to evaluate the characteristics, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors of patients with MM who received bortezomib-based therapy. We identified 5,726 patients in Taiwan with MM newly diagnosed between 2007 and 2015. Confidential data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was used under strict guidelines, as it was made available in an electronic format for research purposes. In addition, we analyzed 96 patients who have been diagnosed with MM and were treated at the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018.Patients receiving first-line treatment with bortezomib had longer overall survival (OS) compared to those who received non-first-line treatment (p<0.001). In addition, the statistically lowest risk of mortality was when patients received first-line bortezomib followed by an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.39, p<0.001). In the TSGH study, the patients were enrolled between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018, with an initial diagnosis of MM; there were 96 individuals treated with bortezomib. There was no statistically significant difference in the OS or progression-free survival (PFS) according to the gender, myeloma type, International Staging System stage, or treatment regimen. There was a significant difference in the PFS in patients receiving first-line bortezomib treatment with transplantation compared to those without transplantation (p = 0.021).Bortezomib as a first-line treatment extended the OS in four-year mortality tracking and lowered the mortality risk according to the NHIRD analysis. In the TSGH analysis, the results indicated that the initial conditions of patients with MM have a lower influence on the OS and PFS after bortezomib-based therapy was administered."

The indocyanine green (ICG) clearance tests and CEUS examinations of 45 noncirrhotic patients with liver tumors were performed prior to liver resection. Parameters time to peak (TtoPk), arrival time (Atm) as well as perfusion parameters A, k and A x k were generated from time-intensity curve (TIC) of CEUS. The correlation analyses of the ICG clearance per unit time (ICGK) and the retention rate at 15 min (ICGR15) with TtoPk, Atm, A, k and A x k were performed, and the diagnostic ability as well as optimal cut-off values of TtoPk and Atm for differentiating patients with ICGR15>10% from ICGR15<10% were analyzed. There were significant correlations of ICGK with TtoPk and Atm, and the correlation coefficients were 0.363 (p = 0.014) and -0.482 (p = 0.001), respectively. Significant correlations of ICGR15 with TtoPk and Atm were revealed, and the correlation coefficients were -0.416 (p = 0.004) and 0.303 (p = 0.043), respectively. No correlation of ICGK or ICGR15 with A, k and A x k was found in this study. There were significant differences in TtoPk and Atm between patients with ICGR15>10% and ICGR15<10% (p = 0.028 and p = 0.026, respectively). TtoPk and Atm both had good diagnostic abilities in diagnosing patients with ICGR15>10% verusus ICGR15<10% (AUROC = 0.711 and 0.721, respectively). For ICGR15>10% vs ICGR15, the optimal cut-off values of TtoPk and Atm were 13.307 s and 11.007 s, respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity were 75.0% and 72.7%, 60.6% and 75.0%, respectively. This study revealed that CEUS has the potential to be a new method to evaluate the liver reserve function of patients. With the optimal cut-off values of TtoPk and Atm, qualitative assessment of patients with ICGR15>10% could be more easily achieved by CEUS with good diagnostic abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2974863229,"Mutation breeding has brought significant contributions to the development of high value crops. It steered the first studies to generate plants with desired mutations of genes encoding key enzymes involved in important metabolic pathways. Molecular characterization of 5-methyl tryptophan (5-MT) resistant plants has revealed different base changes in alpha unit of anthranilate synthase (OsASA) gene that can lead to insensitivity to feedback inhibition of anthranilate synthase. The objective of this study was to perform in silico analysis of microarray data from five progressing time points during grain filling of rice. Results showed various differentially expressed genes. Enrichment of these genes revealed their roles in amino acid transportation during grain filling. Surprisingly, among all DEGs, only LOC_Os06g42560, a tryptophan synthase beta chain, was found to be directly related to tryptophan biosynthesis. It might affect amino acid content during grain filling. For physico-chemical analysis, different grain and eating qualities parameters were measured using mutant rice lines. Evaluation results showed that 5MT resistant-lines (5MT R-lines) showed approximately 60% chalkiness after milling although it had 20 times higher tryptophan content measured in μg/100 mg seeds. Taste quality of these 5MT R-lines in general was not affected significantly. However, other parameters such as peak time of viscosity and gelatinization temperature showed different results compared to the wildtype. Mutant lines generated in this study are important resources for high tryptophan content, although they have lower grain quality than the wildtype. They might be useful for developing new high nutrient rice varieties."
https://openalex.org/W2973876037,"In forensic science, the Widmark equation is widely used to deduce the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at different time points. But the linear model specified by Widmark might be deficient in predicting the breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) at different time points, and extrapolating the peak and the corresponding time. In order to establish the temporal profile of alcohol concentration which captures the effects of non-linear nature of alcohol absorption, elimination, and peak, in particular of Chinese population after a light meal, a drinking experiment was conducted in this study. To achieve this, a double-blind drinking experiment was conducted to measure the BrAC of 52 Chinese participants after a light meal in this study. Prior to the experiment, all participants were required to abstain from food for 4 hours, more importantly, from alcohol and sedatives for 24 hours. A standard light meal was provided about 30 minutes prior to the alcohol intake in the experiment. The BrAC was measured at a 10-minute interval during the absorption phase and 30-minute interval during the elimination phase respectively. The measurements were stopped when the BrAC fell to 0.010 mg/100 ml or below, or more than 8 hours after the alcohol intake. Then, the temporal profiles of BrAC, assuming linear and non-linear relationships, were established using Full Bayesian approach. The linear component indicated the alcohol impairment in normal social function, with which a light meal is usually accompanied with drinking. On the other hand, the non-linear (gamma distribution) part replicated the absorption phase, elimination phase, and the peak of alcohol concentration. The proposed model well performed than the conventional regression model. Additionally, the confounding factors including gender, body weight, and dosage were controlled for. Results should be useful for the development of cost-effective enforcement measures that could deter against drink driving."
