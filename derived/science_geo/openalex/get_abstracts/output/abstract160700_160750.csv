https://openalex.org/W2023525997,"The rigorous size miniaturization of nanotechnology is continually generating new applications and new physical effects. We show here that nanotubes can be formed from thin solid films of almost any material at almost any position, once these films are released from their substrate. This exceptional design flexibility has useful implications, including for fluid transportation and capillarity on the nanometre scale, as well as offering the opportunity to extend fundamental investigations to a new diversity of materials, material systems and geometries."

https://openalex.org/W2060261840,"The large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies is thought to arise from the gravitational instability of small fluctuations in the initial density field of the Universe. A key test of this hypothesis is that forming superclusters of galaxies should generate a systematic infall of other galaxies. This would be evident in the pattern of recessional velocities, causing an anisotropy in the inferred spatial clustering of galaxies. Here we report a precise measurement of this clustering, using the redshifts of more than 141,000 galaxies from the two-degree-field (2dF) galaxy redshift survey. We determine the parameter beta = Omega0.6/b = 0.43 +/- 0.07, where Omega is the total mass-density parameter of the Universe and b is a measure of the 'bias' of the luminous galaxies in the survey. (Bias is the difference between the clustering of visible galaxies and of the total mass, most of which is dark.) Combined with the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, our results favour a low-density Universe with Omega approximately 0.3."

https://openalex.org/W3102672567,"Semiconductor nanostructures based on two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) could form the basis of future devices for sensing, information processing and quantum computation. Although electron transport in 2DEG nanostructures has been well studied, and many remarkable phenomena have already been discovered (for example, weak localization, quantum chaos, universal conductance fluctuations), fundamental aspects of the electron flow through these structures have so far not been clarified. However, it has recently become possible to image current directly through 2DEG devices using scanning probe microscope techniques. Here, we use such a technique to observe electron flow through a narrow constriction in a 2DEG-a quantum point contact. The images show that the electron flow from the point contact forms narrow, branching strands instead of smoothly spreading fans. Our theoretical study of this flow indicates that this branching of current flux is due to focusing of the electron paths by ripples in the background potential. The strands are decorated by interference fringes separated by half the Fermi wavelength, indicating the persistence of quantum mechanical phase coherence in the electron flow. These findings may have important implications for a better understanding of electron transport in 2DEGs and for the design of future nanostructure devices."

https://openalex.org/W1536163743,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Initially, Cl- conductance in the sweat duct was discovered to be impaired in CF1, a finding that has been extended to all CFTR-expressing cells2,3,4. Subsequent cloning of the gene5,6 showed that CFTR functions as a cyclic-AMP-regulated Cl- channel7; and some CF-causing mutations inhibit CFTR Cl- channel activity2,3,4,8. The identification of additional CF-causing mutants with normal Cl- channel activity indicates, however, that other CFTR-dependent processes contribute to the disease. Indeed, CFTR regulates other transporters3,4, including Cl--coupled HCO-3 transport9,10. Alkaline fluids are secreted by normal tissues, whereas acidic fluids are secreted by mutant CFTR-expressing tissues11, indicating the importance of this activity. HCO-3 and pH affect mucin viscosity12,13 and bacterial binding14,15. We have examined Cl--coupled HCO-3 transport by CFTR mutants that retain substantial or normal Cl- channel activity. Here we show that mutants reported to be associated with CF with pancreatic insufficiency do not support HCO-3 transport, and those associated with pancreatic sufficiency show reduced HCO-3 transport. Our findings demonstrate the importance of HCO-3 transport in the function of secretory epithelia and in CF."

Here we investigate the coloration of male Ancyluris meliboeus Fabricius butterflies4, which have patches of unusual microstructure on their ventral wing scales. We find that this highly tilted, multilayered arrangement produces a bright iridescence of broad wavelength range and generates a strong flicker contrast from minimal wing movement."

We investigated this experimentally for caged mink, and found that they would pay high costs to perform a range of natural behaviours, and release cortisol if their most preferred activity, swimming, was prevented.

https://openalex.org/W1554400373,"Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and is removed from the synaptic cleft by sodium-dependent glutamate transporters. To date, five distinct glutamate transporters have been cloned from animal and human tissue: GLAST (EAAT1), GLT-1 (EAAT2), EAAC1 (EAAT3), EAAT4, and EAAT5 (refs 1,2,3,4,5). GLAST and GLT-1 are localized primarily in astrocytes6,7, whereas EAAC1 (refs 8, 9), EAAT4 (refs 9,10,11) and EAAT5 (ref. 5) are neuronal. Studies of EAAT4 and EAAC1 indicate an extrasynaptic localization on perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites8,9,10. This localization facilitates rapid glutamate binding, and may have a role in shaping the amplitude of postsynaptic responses in densely packed cerebellar terminals12,13,14,15. We have used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interacting proteins that may be involved in regulating EAAT4—the glutamate transporter expressed predominately in the cerebellum—or in targeting and/or anchoring or clustering the transporter to the target site. Here we report the identification and characterization of two proteins, GTRAP41 and GTRAP48 (for glutamate transporter EAAT4 associated protein) that specifically interact with the intracellular carboxy-terminal domain of EAAT4 and modulate its glutamate transport activity."

https://openalex.org/W1985173218,"A fascinating class of patterns, often encountered in nature as meandering cracks on rocks, dried-out fields and tectonic plates, is produced by the fracture of solids1. Here we describe the observation and modelling of an unusual type of pattern consisting of spiral cracks in fragments of a thin layer of drying precipitate. We find that this symmetry-breaking cracking mode arises naturally not from twisting forces, but from a propagating stress front induced by the fold-up of the fragments."
