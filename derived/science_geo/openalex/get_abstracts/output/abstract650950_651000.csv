https://openalex.org/W3017241190,"Salt stress is one of the devastating factors that hampers growth and productivity of soybean. Use of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes to improve salt tolerance in soybean has not been thoroughly explored yet. Therefore, we observed the response of hydroponically grown soybean plants, inoculated with halotolerant P. pseudoalcaligenes (SRM-16) and Bacillus subtilis (SRM-3) under salt stress. In vitro testing of 44 bacterial isolates revealed that four isolates showed high salt tolerance. Among them, B. subtilis and P. pseudoalcaligenes showed ACC deaminase activity, siderophore and indole acetic acid (IAA) production and were selected for the current study. We determined that 106 cells/mL of B. subtilis and P. pseudoalcaligenes was sufficient to induce tolerance in soybean against salinity stress (100 mM NaCl) in hydroponics by enhancing plant biomass, relative water content and osmolytes. Upon exposure of salinity stress, P. pseudoalcaligenes inoculated soybean plants showed tolerance by the increased activities of defense related system such as ion transport, antioxidant enzymes, proline and MDA content in shoots and roots. The Na+ concentration in the soybean plants was increased in the salt stress; while, bacterial priming significantly reduced the Na+ concentration in the salt stressed soybean plants. However, the antagonistic results were observed for K+ concentration. Additionally, soybean primed with P. pseudoalcaligenes and exposed to 100 mM NaCl showed a new protein band of 28 kDa suggesting that P. pseudoalcaligenes effectively reduced salt stress. Our results showed that salinity tolerance was more pronounced in P. pseudoalcaligenes as compared to B. subtilis. However, a detailed study at molecular level to interpret the mechanism by which P. pseudoalcaligenes alleviates salt stress in soybean plants need to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W3016611637,"There is an increasing interest from the aquafeed industry in functional feeds containing selected additives that improve fish growth performance and health status. Functional feed additives include probiotics, prebiotics, organic acids, and phytogenics (substances derived from plants and their extracts). This study evaluated the effects of dietary inclusion of a mucilage extract rich in galactomannan oligosaccharides (GMOS), a mixture of garlic and labiatae-plants oils (PHYTO), and a combination of them (GMOSPHYTO), on gut microbiota composition of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) fed with a low fishmeal (FM) and fish oil (FO) diet. Three experimental diets and a control diet (plant-based formulation with 10% FM and 6% FO) were tested in a 63-days feeding trial. To analyze the microbiota associated to feeds and the intestinal autochthonous (mucosa-adhered) and allochthonous (transient) microbial communities, the Illumina MiSeq platform for sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and QIIME2 pipeline were used. Metabarcoding analysis of feed-associated bacteria showed that the microbial communities of control (CTRL) feed deeply differed from those of experimental diets. The number of reads was significantly lower in CTRL feed than in other feeds. The OTU (operational taxonomic unit) number was instead similar between the feeds, ranging from 42 to 50 OTUs. The variation of resident gut microbiota induced by diet was lower than the variation of transient intestinal microbiota, because feedstuffs are a major source of allochthonous bacteria, which can temporarily integrate into the gut transient microbiome. However, the composition of transient bacterial communities was not simply a mirror of feed-borne bacteria. Indeed, the microbial profile of feeds was different from both faecal and mucosa profiles. Our findings suggest that the dietary inclusion of GMOS (0.5%) and PHYTO (0.02%) in a low FM and FO diet induces changes in gut microbiota composition of European sea bass. However, if on allochthonous microbiota the combined inclusion of GMOS and PHYTO showed an antagonistic effect on bactericidal activity against Vibrionales, at mucosa level, only GMOSPHYTO diet increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidales, Lactobacillales, and Clostridiales resident bacterial orders. The main beneficial effects of GMOS and PHYTO on gut microbiota are the reduction of coliforms and Vibrionales bacteria, which include several potentially pathogenic species for fish, and the enrichment of gut microbiota composition with butyrate producer taxa. Therefore, these functional ingredients have a great potential to be used as health-promoting agents in the farming of European sea bass and other marine fish."
https://openalex.org/W3016881059,"The WST-1 assay is the most common test to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity of chemicals. Tetrazolium-based assays can, however, be affected by the interference of tested chemicals, including carbon nanotubes or Mg particles. Here, we report a new interference of Mn materials with the WST-1 assay. Endothelial cells exposed to Mn particles (Mn alone or Fe-Mn alloy from 50 to 1600 μg/ml) were severely damaged according to the WST-1 assay, but not the ATP content assay. Subsequent experiments revealed that Mn particles interfere with the reduction of the tetrazolium salt to formazan. Therefore, the WST-1 assay is not suitable to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of Mn-containing materials, and luminescence-based assays such as CellTiter-Glo® appear more appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W3016570956,"Background Serratia marcescens is an emerging pathogen that causes a variety of health care associated infections. S. marcescens is equipped with an arsenal of virulence factors such as biofilm formation, swimming and swarming motilities, prodigiosin, protease and others which enable it to initiate and cause the infection. These virulence factors are orchestrated under the umbrella of an intercellular communication system named Quorum sensing (QS). QS allows bacterial population to synchronize the expression of virulence genes upon detection of a chemical signaling molecule. Targeting bacterial virulence is a promising approach to attenuate bacteria and enhances the ability of immune system to eradicate the bacterial infection. Drug repurposing is an advantageous strategy that confers new applications for drugs outside the scope of their original medical use. This promising strategy offers the use of safe approved compounds, which potentially lowers the costs and shortens the time than that needed for development of new drugs. Sitagliptin is dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, is used to treat diabetes mellitus type II as it increases the production of insulin and decreasing the production of glucagon by the pancreas. We aimed in this study to repurpose sitagliptin, investigating the anti-virulence activities of sitagliptin on S. marcescens. Methods The effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of sitagliptin on virulence factors; protease, prodigiosin, biofilm formation, swimming and swarming motilities was estimated phenotypically. The qRT-PCR was used to show the effect of sitagliptin on the expression of QS-regulated virulence genes. The in-vivo protective activity of sitagliptin on S. marcescens pathogenesis was evaluated on mice. Results Sitagliptin (1 mg/ml) significantly reduced the biofilm formation, swimming and swarming motilities, prodigiosin and protease. The qRT-PCR confirmed the effect on virulence as shown by down regulating the expression of fimA, fimC, flhC, flhD, bsmB, rssB, rsmA, pigP, and shlA genes. Moreover, the in-vivo findings showed the efficient ability of sitagliptin to weaken S. marcescens pathogenesis. Conclusion Sitagliptin is a promising anti-virulence agent against S. marcescens that may be beneficial in the control of healthcare associated infections caused by S. marcescens."
https://openalex.org/W3016330637,"Background Breast cancer is one of the top types of cancer affecting women both in the developed and developing countries. Breast cancer is a chronic and debilitating condition for anybody diagnosed of it and as well as their family. Social support has been shown to offset or moderate the impact of stress caused by the illness and other related negative outcomes. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the availability, accessibility, and impact of social support on treatment for breast cancer patients at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Ashanti Region in Ghana. Materials and methods A phenomenological study was employed. An in-depth interview guide was used to collect data on socio-demographic variables and social support availability and accessibility from 15 breast cancer patients. Thematic analysis was employed. Results Majority of the women who participated in the study were postmenopausal women with an average age of 55 years. The study also revealed that all the participants in this study received one kind of support or another including informational, financial, emotional, and tangible support and reported varying positive impacts on their lives as a result of the support received. For those who received support, the prognosis and general quality of life appeared promising and well-adjusted than those who reported not having received any form of support. Conclusion Social support is critical for the survival and quality of life of chronic disease patients including breast cancer patients who were the focus of this study. The availability and/or accessibility of social support or otherwise significantly determines the prognosis and quality of life of breast cancer patients. Healthcare professionals and family members or significant others are major players in organizing social support for chronic disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W3016377112,"People who inject drugs (PWID) are at an increased risk for HIV infection due to injection and sexual risk behaviors. This study aims to examine PrEP knowledge, awareness, and willingness to be linked to PrEP services at a syringe services program (SSP), and examine the relationship between substance use and interest in PrEP linkage.Data were collected using a cross-sectional survey of IDEA SSP clients in Miami, FL (N = 157). Based on reported substance injected, participants were classified into opioid-only injection or polysubstance injection. Socio-demographics and HIV risk were examined using Pearson's Chi-Squared analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to test for significant correlates of interest in PrEP linkage.Only 28.3% of PWID surveyed had previously heard of PrEP. However, 57.2% were interested in receiving more information about PrEP. In the adjusted model, people with opioid-only use were significantly less likely to report interest in being linked to PrEP.Knowledge, awareness, and interest in being linked to PrEP were low among PWID surveyed. No participants of the study were successfully linked to PrEP services through direct referrals. Further research is needed to examine low threshold service delivery of PrEP to PWID at SSPs."
https://openalex.org/W3016535049,"Background Non-use of modern contraceptives among married or in-union women aged 15 to 49 years is a demographic and public health challenge. Studies on the predictors of contraceptive use among women in Sierra Leone are few, more than two decades old, and not nationally representative. This study aims to fill this gap by estimating the prevalence and the predictors of the current use of modern contraceptives among married or in-union women in Sierra Leone. Methods This is a population-based study that used the 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS) dataset. We performed complex samples logistic regression with 9,111 reproductive-age women. The analysis was done using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 21, and statistical significance was pegged at p≤0.01 and p≤0.05. The outcome of interest is the current use of modern contraceptives among reproductive-age married or in-union women in Sierra Leone, measured as ‘Yes’ (currently using a modern method) and ‘No’ (using a folkloric method, traditional method, and no method). Results About 18.1% of reproductive-age women were currently using a modern contraceptive. The study found the following sociodemographic factors as positive correlates: being within the age group of 20–24 years [AOR = 1.52, CI: 1.05, 2.19], 25–29 years [AOR = 1.57, CI: 1.10, 2.19], 30–34 years [AOR = 2.31, CI: 1.59, 3.36], 35–39 years [AOR = 1.89, CI: 1.33, 2.70], 40–44 years [AOR = 1.68, CI: 1.12, 2.52], obtaining either a primary [AOR = 1.40, CI: 1.14, 1.71] or secondary level education [AOR = 1.34, CI: 1.02, 1.74], belonging to the category of women that condemned wife beating under only one condition [AOR = 1.37, CI: 1.03, 1.78], under two conditions [AOR = 1.45, CI: 1.08, 1.93], under three conditions [AOR = 1.73, CI: 1.28, 2.35], under four conditions [AOR = 1.91, CI: 1.34, 2.72], and under five conditions [AOR = 1.41, CI: 1.07, 1.85], having the ability to refuse sex [AOR = 1.46, CI: 1.23, 1.76], ever heard family planning on the radio [AOR = 1.30, CI: 1.08, 1.58], being sexually active four weeks prior to the survey [AOR = 3.90, CI: 3.14, 4.84], ever taken an HIV test [AOR = 1.67, CI: 1.39, 2.02], ever visited a health facility in the last 12 months [AOR = 1.73, CI: 1.44, 2.09], dwelling in a richer household [AOR = 1.32, CI: 1.01, 1.72], and dwelling in an urban area [AOR = 1.44, CI: 1.14, 1.81]. Exposure to family planning through print media (newspaper/magazine) was negatively associated with current use of modern contraceptive [AOR = 0.60, CI: 0.37, 0.96]. Conclusion The study provided in-depth insight into the sociodemographic predictors of the current use of modern contraceptives among married or in-union women in Sierra Leone. The study underscored the need to promote the protective factors of the current use of modern contraceptives and address the risk factors of the low prevalence of modern contraceptive use through policies, programs, and interventions in Sierra Leone."
https://openalex.org/W3016642162,"Emerging data suggest that noninvasive voice biomarker analysis is associated with coronary artery disease. We recently showed that a vocal biomarker was associated with hospitalization and heart failure in patients with heart failure. We evaluate the association between a vocal biomarker and invasively measured indices of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Patients were referred for an invasive cardiac hemodynamic study between January 2017 and December 2018, and had their voices recorded on three separate occasions to their smartphone prior to each study. A pre-established vocal biomarker was determined based on each individual recording. The intra-class correlation co-efficient between the separate voice recording biomarker values for each individual participant was 0.829 (95% CI 0.740–0.889) implying very good agreement between values. Thus, the mean biomarker was calculated for each patient. Patients were divided into two groups: high pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) defined as ≥ 35 mmHg (moderate or greater PH), versus lower PAP. Eighty three patients, mean age 61.6 ± 15.1 years, 37 (44.6%) male, were included. Patients with a high mean PAP (≥ 35 mmHg) had on average significantly higher values of the mean voice biomarker compared to those with a lower mean PAP (0.74 ± 0.85 vs. 0.40 ± 0.88 p = 0.046). Multivariate logistic regression showed that an increase in the mean voice biomarker by 1 unit was associated with a high PAP, odds ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.05–5.07, p = 0.038. This study shows a relationship between a noninvasive vocal biomarker and an invasively derived hemodynamic index related to PH obtained during clinically indicated cardiac catheterization. These results may have important practical clinical implications for telemedicine and remote monitoring of patients with heart failure and PH."
https://openalex.org/W3016521585,"The ancestor of most teleost fishes underwent a whole-genome duplication event three hundred million years ago. Despite its antiquity, the effects of this event are evident both in the structure of teleost genomes and in how the surviving duplicated genes still operate to drive form and function. I inferred a set of shared syntenic regions that survive from the teleost genome duplication (TGD) using eight teleost genomes and the outgroup gar genome (which lacks the TGD). I then phylogenetically modeled the TGD's resolution via shared and independent gene losses and applied a new simulation-based statistical test for the presence of bias toward the preservation of genes from one parental subgenome. On the basis of that test, I argue that the TGD was likely an allopolyploidy. I find that duplicate genes surviving from this duplication in zebrafish are less likely to function in early embryo development than are genes that have returned to single copy at some point in this species' history. The tissues these ohnologs are expressed in, as well as their biological functions, lend support to recent suggestions that the TGD was the source of a morphological innovation in the structure of the teleost retina. Surviving duplicates also appear less likely to be essential than singletons, despite the fact that their single-copy orthologs in mouse are no less essential than other genes."
https://openalex.org/W3016328801,"Purpose The Polar OH1 is an optical heart rate (HR) sensor which can be used on different parts of the body. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the validity of the OH1 as well as a wrist worn heart rate device (Polar M600) during swimming. Methods Twenty-six well-trained competitive swimmers performed a regular training session including different swimming intensities. During the training the swimmers wore a H10 HR sensor with Polar Pro strap (H10) underneath the swim suit, a Polar OH1 optical HR sensor (OH1) underneath the swimming cap at the temple, and a sports watch with optical HR sensor, Polar M600 smart watch (M600) on the wrist. Results No difference in HRmax, HRmean and HRmin between H10 and OH1 were evident. The HRmax and HRmean obtained by the M600 was significantly lower than the obtained by H10 and OH1 (p < 0.05). The ICC showed mostly excellent agreements between H10 and OH1 and poor to good agreements between H10 and M600. Bland-Altmann plot for M600 vs. H10 indicates upper and lower limits of agreement of -53.0 to 33.9 beats per minute. For OH1 vs. H10 the upper and lower limits of agreement were -26.9 to 24.7 beats per minute. Conclusion The Polar OH1 optical HR sensor is a valid tool to monitor HR of different intensities during swimming whereas the Polar M600 smart watch as a wrist worn device is less accurate."
https://openalex.org/W3017347565,"Variation in utilization of healthcare services is influenced by patient, provider and healthcare system characteristics. It could also be related to the evidence supporting their use, as reflected in the availability and strength of recommendations in clinical guidelines. In this study, we analyzed the geographic variation of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer screening utilization in Switzerland and the influence of available guidelines and different modifiers of access. Colonoscopy, mammography and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing use in eligible population in 2014 was assessed with administrative claims data. We ran a multilevel multivariable logistic regression model and calculated Moran’s I and regional level median odds ratio (MOR) statistics to explore residual geographic variation. In total, an estimated 8.1% of eligible persons received colonoscopy, 22.3% mammography and 31.3% PSA testing. Low deductibles, supplementary health insurance and enrollment in a managed care plan were associated with higher screening utilization. Cantonal breast cancer screening programs were also associated with higher utilization. Spatial clustering was observed in the raw regional utilization of all services, but only for prostate cancer screening in regional residuals of the multilevel model. MOR was highest for prostate cancer screening (1.24) and lowest for colorectal cancer screening (1.16). The reasons for the variation of the prostate cancer screening utilization, not recommended routinely without explicit shared decision-making, could be further investigated by adding provider characteristics and patient preference information. This first cross-comparison of different cancer screening patterns indicates that the strength of recommendations, mediated by specific health policies facilitating screening, may indeed contribute to variation."
https://openalex.org/W3017141553,"Molecular-based taxonomy, specifically DNA barcoding, has streamlined organism identification. For land plants, the recommended 2-locus barcode of rbcL and matK is not suitable for all groups, thus the second subunit of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) has received attention as a possible alternative. To date, evaluations of ITS2 have mostly been limited in scope to specific plant orders/families and single source material. Prior to using ITS2 to routinely characterize land plants present in environmental samples (i.e., DNA metabarcoding), a wet lab protocol optimized for bulk sample types is needed. To address this gap, in this study we determined the broad recoverability across land plants when using published ITS2 primer pairs, and subsequently optimized the PCR reaction constituents and cycling conditions for the best two performing primer pairs (ITS2F/ITSp4 and ITSp3/ITSu4). Using these conditions, both primer pairs were used to characterize land plants present in 17 diverse soils collected from across the US. The resulting PCR amplicons were prepared into libraries and pooled for sequencing on an Illumina® MiniSeq. Our existing bioinformatics workflow was used to process raw sequencing data and taxonomically assign unique ITS2 plant sequences by comparison to GenBank. Given strict quality criteria were imposed on sequences for inclusion in data analysis, only 43.6% and 7.5% of sequences from ITS2F/ITSp4 and ITSp3/ITSu4 respectively remained for taxonomic comparisons; ~7–11% of sequences originated from fungal co-amplification. The number of orders and families recovered did differ between primer pairs, with ITS2F/ITSp4 consistently outperforming ITSp3/ITSu4 by >15%. Primer pair bias was observed in the recovery of certain taxonomic groups; ITS2F/ITSp4 preferentially recovered flowering plants and grasses, whereas ITSp3/ITSu4 recovered more moss taxa. To maximize data recovery and reduce potential bias, we advocate that studies using ITS2 to characterize land plants from environmental samples such as soil use a multiple primer pair approach."
https://openalex.org/W3017359501,"Purpose The study aimed to assess the proportion of eye care service utilization and associated factors among older adults age ≥ 40 years in Hawassa city, South Ethiopia, June 2019. Method A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among adults aged 40 years and above who permanently live in Hawassa city from April 25 to May 30, 2019. Multistage sampling technique was used to select 704 participants. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The collected data was entered to EPI info version 7 & was analyzed by SPSS version 20. Binary logistic regression model was used to identify actual predictors of eye care service utilization. All variables were entered to multivariable analysis and variables with p-value < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Result A total of 668 adults participated with a response rate of 94.9%. The median (±IQR) age of study respondents was 48(±10) years and 52.7% were females. The proportion of eye care service utilization within the past 2 years was found to be 23.8% [95% CI: 20.5%-27.1%]. Having history of eye disease [AOR = 9.8, 95% CI: 6.1–15.6], having awareness of regular eye checkup importance [AOR = 7.3, 95% CI:4.4–12.2], older age (age ≥65 years) [AOR = 5.0, 95% CI:1.9–13.3] and higher family monthly income (income ≥6000 ETB) [AOR = 3.0, 95% CI:1.5–5.7] and income 4001–5999 ETB [AOR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4–5.9] were positively associated with eye care service utilization. Conclusion and recommendation The proportion of eye care service utilization among older adults in Hawassa city was low. Having a history of eye disease, having awareness about regular eye checkup importance, older age and higher family monthly income were significantly associated with utilization of eye care service. Therefore, it is recommended to provide eye health education for the community to increase awareness about eye care service utilization which can improve eye care service utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2810387883,"Purpose To investigate whether microsurgical excision of trabecular meshwork (TM) in an ex vivo pigmentary glaucoma model can normalize the hypertensive phenotype. Methods Eight eyes of a porcine pigmentary glaucoma model underwent 90° of microsurgical TM excision with an aspirating dual-blade (Goniotome (G)). 24 hours later, additional 90° of TM were removed. Anterior segments with sham surgeries served as the control (C). Outflow facility and intraocular pressure (IOP) were analyzed. Histology with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was obtained. Results After the first 90° TM excision, IOP was significantly lower in G (10.2±2.4 mmHg, n = 7) than C (20.0±2.0mmHg, n = 8, P<0.01). Outflow facility in G (0.38±0.07 μl/min/mmHg) was higher than C (0.16±0.02 μl/min/mmHg, P<0.01). After the second 90° TM excision, IOP in G (6.46±0.81 mmHg, n = 7) was significantly lower than C (20.3±1.7 mmHg, n = 8, P<0.001), while the outflow facility in G (0.50±0.05 μl/min/mmHg, n = 7) was higher than C (0.16±0.01 μl/min/mmHg, n = 8, P<0.001). Compared to the first excision, excision of an additional 90° did not change of IOP (P = 0.20) or outflow facility (P = 0.17) further. Conclusions Excision of 90° of TM in a pigmentary glaucoma model using an aspirating dual-blade decreased IOP and increased outflow facility."
https://openalex.org/W3016417130,"Much is still unknown about the transition to adulthood for youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including what preparation activities best support positive adult outcomes. Parents play a crucial role in the transition planning and preparation process, yet the existing literature lacks detailed information about parent perceptions about transition preparation activities. To examine family transition preparation activities, we conducted a ten-month study of the transition preparation process of 15 families of youth with ASD across an academic year. Youth were ages 14–17 and 93% male. We collected data on transition preparation activity time spent and parent satisfaction over twenty data collection points. We used multi-level modeling to determine longitudinal trajectories of parent-reported preparation for the transition to adulthood based on endorsed transition preparation activities. Findings from this preliminary study revealed that discussions about the future were the most commonly endorsed activities, while social activities were most associated with increased parental perception of transition preparation over time. This study expands understanding of various transition preparation activities engaged in by families of youth with ASD during high school, though research with a larger and more diverse sample is needed to extend findings."
https://openalex.org/W3016525943,"Background Scale-up and expansion of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with HIV (PLHIV) have been a global priority for more than 15 years. Methods We describe PLHIV at enrollment in care and ART initiation in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania from 2005–2014 and report on enrollment location, CD4 count and loss to follow-up (LTF), death, and combined attrition (LTF and death) pre- and post-ART initiation over time. Pre-ART outcomes were estimated using competing risk and post-ART using Kaplan-Meier estimators; LTF defined as no visit within six months pre-ART and 12 months after ART start. Results From 2005–2014, 884,328 PLHIV enrolled in care at 350 health facilities, median age was 32.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 26.0–42.0), and majority were female (66.5%). The proportion of PLHIV enrolled at primary and rural facilities increased from 12.9% and 15.3% in 2005–2006 to 43.5% and 41.7% in 2013–2014 (p<0.0001). Median CD4+ cell count at enrollment increased from 171 cell/mm3 in 2005–2006 (IQR 71–339) to 289 cell/mm3 in 2013–2014 (IQR 133–485) (p<0.0001). A total of 460,758 (57.4%) PLHIV initiated treatment. Cumulative risk of LTF for PLHIV prior to ART initiation 12 months after enrollment was 33.5% (95%CI 33.36–33.58) and 21.98% (95%CI 21.9–22.1) after ART initiation. Pregnant women and the youngest PLHIV group had the highest attrition after ART initiation, at 24 months 40.8% (95%CI 40.1–41.6) of pregnant women and 47.4% (95%CI 46.4–48.4) of PLHIV 15–19 years were not retained. Attrition at 12 months after enrollment among PLHIV regardless of ART status was 38.5% (95%CI 38.4–38.6). Conclusion Over 10 years of HIV scale-up in four sub-Saharan African countries, close to a million PLHIV were enrolled in care increasingly at rural and primary facilities with increasing CD4 count. Loss to follow-up from HIV care remains alarmingly high, particularly among pregnant women and younger PLHIV."
https://openalex.org/W3016871979,"RNA-guided endonucleases such as Cas9 provide efficient on-target genome editing in cells but may also cleave at off-target loci throughout the genome. Engineered variants of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) have been developed to globally reduce off-target activity, but individual off-targets may remain, or on-target activity may be compromised. In order to evolve against activity at specific off-targets while maintaining strong on-target editing, we developed a novel M13 bacteriophage-mediated selection method. Using this method, sequential rounds of positive and negative selection are used to identify mutations to Cas9 that enhance or diminish editing activity at particular genomic sequences. We also introduce scanning mutagenesis of oligo-directed targets (SMOOT), a comprehensive mutagenesis method to create highly diverse libraries of Cas9 variants that can be challenged with phage-based selection. Our platform identifies novel SpCas9 mutants which mitigate cleavage against off-targets both in biochemical assays and in T-cells while maintaining higher on-target activity than previously described variants. We describe an evolved variant, S. pyogenes Adapted to Reduce Target Ambiguity Cas9 (SpartaCas), composed of the most enriched mutations, each of unknown function. This evolved Cas9 mutant reduces off-target cleavage while preserving efficient editing at multiple therapeutically relevant targets. Directed evolution of Cas9 using our system demonstrates an improved structure-independent methodology to effectively engineer nuclease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3016318297,"To determine the feasibility of complex home-based phenotyping, 1,876 research participants from the customer base of 23andMe completed an online version of a Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) as well as a cold pressor test (CPT) which is used in clinical assessments of pain. Overall our online version of the PSQ performed similarly to the original pen-and-paper version. Construct validity of the PSQ total was demonstrated by internal consistency and consistent discrimination between more and less painful items. Criterion validity was demonstrated by correlation with pain sensitivity as measured by the CPT. Within the same cohort we performed a cold pressor test using a layperson description and household equipment. Comparison with published reports from controlled studies revealed similar distributions of cold pain tolerance times (i.e., time elapsed before removing the hand from the water). Of those who elected to participate in the CPT, a large majority of participants did not report issues with the test procedure or noncompliance with the instructions (97%). We confirmed a large sex difference in CPT thresholds in line with published data, such that women removed their hands from the water at a median of 54.2 seconds, with men lasting for a median time of 82.7 seconds (Kruskal-Wallis statistic, p < 0.0001), but other factors like age or current pain treatment were at most weakly associated, and inconsistently between men and women. We introduce a new paradigm for performing pain testing, called testing@home, that, in the case of cold nociception, showed comparable results to studies conducted under controlled conditions and supervision of a health care professional."

This study aimed to determine predictors of perinatal death in the presence of missing data using birth registry data from Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC), between 2000-2015.This was a retrospective cohort study from the medical birth registry at KCMC referral hospital located in Moshi Municipality, Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania. Data were analyzed using Stata version 15.1. Multiple imputation by fully conditional specification (FCS) was used to impute missing values. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine the marginal effects of covariates on perinatal death using a log link mean model with robust standard errors. An exchangeable correlation structure was used to account for the dependence of observations within mothers.Among 50,487 deliveries recorded in the KCMC medical birth registry between 2000-2015, 4.2% (95%CI 4.0%, 4.3%) ended in perinatal death (equivalent to a perinatal mortality rate (PMR) of 41.6 (95%CI 39.9, 43.3) deaths per 1,000 births). After the imputation of missing values, the proportion of perinatal death remained relatively the same. The risk of perinatal death was significantly higher among deliveries from mothers who resided in rural compared to urban areas (RR = 1.241, 95%CI 1.137, 1.355), with primary education level (RR = 1.201, 95%CI 1.083, 1.332) compared to higher education level, with <4 compared to ≥4 antenatal care (ANC) visits (RR = 1.250, 95%CI 1.146, 1.365), with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (RR = 2.638, 95%CI 1.997, 3.486), abruption placenta (RR = 4.218, 95%CI 3.438, 5.175), delivered a low birth weight baby (LBW) (RR = 4.210, 95%CI 3.788, 4.679), male child (RR = 1.090, 95%CI 1.007, 1.181), and were referred for delivery (RR = 2.108, 95%CI 1.919, 2.317). On the other hand, deliveries from mothers who experienced premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) (RR = 0.411, 95%CI 0.283, 0.598) and delivered through cesarean section (CS) (RR = 0.662, 95%CI 0.604, 0.724) had a lower risk of perinatal death.Perinatal mortality in this cohort is higher than the national estimate. Higher risk of perinatal death was associated with low maternal education level, rural residence, <4 ANC visits, PPH, abruption placenta, LBW delivery, child's sex, and being referred for delivery. Ignoring missing values in the analysis of adverse pregnancy outcomes produces biased covariate coefficients and standard errors. Close clinical follow-up of women at high risk of experiencing perinatal death, particularly during ANC visits and delivery, is of high importance to increase perinatal survival."
https://openalex.org/W3017344554,"Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is a cool-season pulse grown in winter cropping cycle in South Asia and provides a major source of nutrition for many low-income households. Lentil productivity is perceived to be sensitive to high rainfall, but few studies document spatial and temporal patterns of yield variation across climate, soil, and agronomic gradients. Using farm survey data from Nepal, this study characterizes patterns of lentil productivity and efficiency for two cropping seasons. Additional insights were derived from on-farm trials conducted over a 5-year period that assess agronomic, drainage, and cultivar interventions. To contextualize the inferences derived from farm surveys and trials, the Stempedia model was used to simulate the severity of Stemphylium blight (Stemphylium botryosum) risk-the principal fungal disease in lentil-with 30 years of historical climate data. Although development efforts in Nepal have prioritized pulse intensification, results confirm that lentil remains a risky enterprise highlighting the prevalence of crop failures (16%), modest yields (353 kg ha-1), and low levels of profitability (US$ 33 ha-1) in wet winters. Nevertheless, site factors such as drainage class influence responses with upland sites performing well in wet winters and lowland sites performing well in dry winters. In wet winters, a phenomena perceived to be increasing, 76% of surveyed farmers reported significant disease pressure and simulations with Stempedia predict that conditions favoring Stemphylium occur in >60% of all years. Nevertheless, simulation results also suggest that these risks can be addressed through earlier planting. Based on the combined results, gains in yield, yield stability, and technical efficiency can be enhanced in western Nepal by: 1) ensuring timely lentil planting to mitigate climate-mediated disease risk, 2) evaluating new lentil lines that may provide enhanced resistance to diseases and waterlogging, and 3) encouraging the emergence of mechanization solutions to overcome labor bottlenecks."
https://openalex.org/W3016295065,"Human error is an important risk factor for flight safety. Although the human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) is an available tool for human reliability derivation, it has not been applied in flight safety assessment. The traditional HEART suffers from imprecise calculation of the assessed proportion of affect (APOA) because it heavily depends on a single expert's judgment. It also fails to provide remedial measures for flight safety problems. To overcome these defects of the HEART, this study proposes an integrated human error quantification approach that uses the improved analytic hierarchy process method to determine the APOA values. Then, these values are fused to the HEART method to derive the human error probability. A certain flight task is completed to assess human reliability. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is a reasonable and feasible tool for quantifying human error probability and assessing flight safety in the aircraft manipulation process. In addition, the critical error-producing conditions influencing flight safety are identified, and improvement measures for high-error-rate operations are provided. The proposed method is useful for reducing the possibility of human error and enhancing flight safety levels in aircraft operation processes."
https://openalex.org/W3016361809,"Vocal communication in animals often involves taking turns vocalizing. In humans, turn-taking is a fundamental rule in conversation. Among non-human primates, the common marmoset is known to engage in antiphonal calling using phee calls and trill calls. Calls of the trill type are the most common, yet difficult to study, because they are not very loud and uttered in conditions when animals are in close proximity to one another. Here we recorded trill calls in captive pair-housed marmosets using wearable microphones, while the animals were together with their partner or separated, but within trill call range. Trills were exchanged mainly with the partner and not with other animals in the room. Animals placed outside the home cage increased their trill call rate and uttered more trills in response to their partner compared to strangers. The fundamental frequency, F0, of trills increased when animals were placed outside the cage. Our results indicate that trill calls can be monitored using wearable audio equipment and that minor changes in social context affect trill call interactions and spectral properties of trill calls."
https://openalex.org/W3016507962,"Background Despite favorable climatic conditions, vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is widespread in Pakistan. Current study was aimed to evaluate the prevalence of VDD in Pakistani pregnant women and effectiveness of various regimen of Vitamin D supplementation. Methodology This hospital-based prospective cohort study included pregnant women at 12th to 24th weeks of gestation attending Gynae clinic from October 2018 to April 2019. Patients were classified into control and treatment groups (Groups: G1, G2 and G3) according to the dose of vitamin D supplementation. Patients received various regimens of vitamin D including 2000 IU/day (G1), 5000 IU/day (G2) and stat 200000 IU (G3). The levels of vitamin D were measured before and after supplementation. The effectiveness of dosages were compared between and within the groups. Moreover, factors associated with vitamin D sufficiency and insufficiency were ascertained using appropriate statistical methods. Results Among 281 pregnant women (mean age: 28.22 ± 4.61 years), VDD was prevalent in 47.3% cases. Vitamin D supplementation caused significant rise in the levels 25(OH)D in treatment groups, while there was no significant difference in control group. The highest mean increment in vitamin D (23.14 ± 11.18 ng/ml) was observed with dose 5000 IU/day followed by doses 200000 IU stat (21.06 ± 13.73 ng/ml) and 2000 IU/day (10.24 ± 5.65 ng/ml). Vitamin D toxicity was observed in one patient who received 200000 IU stat of vitamin D. The frequency of VDD following the supplementation was 5.7%. Education status, duration of sun exposure and use of sunblock was substantially associated with vitamin D sufficiency in the current study. Conclusion Our findings underscore the high proportion of VDD among pregnant women in Pakistan. Maternal vitamin D supplementation substantially improved the levels of 25(OH)D. Of three used regimens, the dose of 5000 IU/day is considered safe and equally effective as of 200000 IU stat. Since pregnancy is a time of tremendous growth and physiological changes for mother and her developing fetus with lifelong implications for the child, gestational vitamin D supplementation should be considered to ensure the optimal vitamin D accrual in pregnant women. This study generates the hypothesis that vitamin D supplementation at a dose of 5000 IU/day during pregnancy is superior to the other regimens. However, well-controlled randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3016854462,"Background Ultrasound-guided transthoracic core needle biopsy (US-TCNB) is a promising method for establishing the correct diagnosis of mediastinal masses. However, the existing studies in this area are scant and with small samples. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic value and the complication rate of US-TCNB, particularly large bore cutting biopsy in patients with mediastinal lesions. Material and methods This retrospective study includes 566 patients with mediastinal lesions suspicious of malignancy evaluated between March 2004 and December 2018. Inclusion criteria: 1. Patients with mediastinal lesions detected on thoracic CT scan; 2. Lesions more than 15 mm; 3. Negative histological diagnosis after bronchoscopic biopsy; 4. Normal coagulation status; 5. Cooperative patient; 6. Written informed consent. US visualization of the mediastinal lesions was successful in 308 (54.4%). In all of them, US-TCNB was performed. All patients with mediastinal lesions unsuitable for US visualization were evaluated for a CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (CT-TTNB), which was done if the presence of a safe trajectory was available (n = 41, 7.2%). All patients inappropriate for image-guided TTNB were referred to primary surgical diagnostic procedures (n = 217, 38.3%). Results The US-TCNB is a highly effective (accuracy 96%, sensitivity 95%) and safe tool (2.6% complications) in the diagnosis of all subgroups mediastinal lesions. It is non-inferior to CT-TTNB (90%) and comes close to the effectiveness of surgical biopsy techniques (98.4%), but is less invasive and with a lower complication rate. Conclusion US-TCNB of mediastinal lesions is highly effective and safe tool which is particularly helpful in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W3016930137,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of medicinal herbal mixtures rich in phenolic, flavonoid and alkaloid compounds on ruminal fermentation and microbial populations, and fatty acid (FA) concentrations and lipid oxidation in tissues of lambs infected with the gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) parasite (Haemonchus contortus). Parallel in vitro and in vivo studies were performed using two different herbal mixtures (Mix1 and Mix2). The in vitro study was conducted in a 2 (infection status; non-infected versus infected) × 3 (diets; control, Mix1 and Mix2) factorial design. In the in vivo study, 24 lambs were equally divided into four treatments: non-infected lambs fed a control diet, infected lambs fed the control diet, infected lambs fed a diet with Mix1 and infected lambs fed a diet with Mix2. Herbal mixtures (100 g dry matter (DM)/d) were added to the basal diets of meadow hay (ad libitum) and a commercial concentrate (500 g DM/d). The experimental period lasted for 70 days. Ruminal fermentation characteristics and methane production were not affected by infection in vivo or in vitro. Both herbal mixture supplementation increased total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations (P < 0.01) and DM digestibility (P < 0.01) in vitro. Archaea population was slightly diminished by both herbal mixtures (P < 0.05), but they did not lower methane production in vitro or in vivo (P > 0.05). Infection of H. contortus or herbal mixtures modulated FA proportion mainly in the liver, especially the long chain FA proportion. Concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in serum were significantly higher after 70 days post-infection in the infected lambs. Herbal Mix1 supplementation reduced TBARS concentrations in meat after seven days of storage. In conclusion, supplementing of herbal mixtures to the diets of GIN parasite infected lambs did not affect the basic ruminal fermentation parameters. Herbal mixtures may improve few FA proportions mainly in liver as well as decrease lipid oxidation in meat."
https://openalex.org/W3017017637,"Background In their mission to achieve better access to quality healthcare services, mutual health organisations (MHOs) are not limited to providing health insurance. As democratically controlled member organisations, MHOs aim to make people’s voices heard. At national level, they seek involvement in the design of social protection policies; at local level, they seek to improve responsiveness of healthcare services to members’ needs and expectations. Methods In this qualitative study, we investigated whether MHOs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) succeed in defending members’ rights by improving healthcare quality while minimising expenses. The data originate from an earlier in-depth investigation conducted in the DRC in 2016 of the performance of 13 MHOs. We re-analysed this existing dataset and more specifically investigated actions that the MHOs undertook to improve quality and affordability of healthcare provision for their members, using a framework for analysis based on Hirschman’s exit-voice theory. This framework distinguishes four mechanisms for MHO members to use in influencing providers: (1) ‘exit’ or ‘voting with the feet’; (2) ‘co-producing a long voice route’ or imposing rules through strategic purchasing; (3) ‘guarding over the long voice route of accountability’ or pressuring authorities to regulate and enforce regulations; and (4) ‘strengthening the short voice route’ by transforming the power imbalance at the provider–patient interface. Results All studied MHOs used these four mechanisms to improve healthcare provision. Most healthcare providers, however, did not recognise their authority to do so. In the DRC, controlling quality and affordability of healthcare is firmly seen as a role for the health authorities, but the authorities only marginally take up this role. Under current circumstances, the power of MHOs in the DRC to enhance quality and affordability of healthcare is weak. Conclusion On their own, mutual health organisations in the DRC do not have sufficient power to influence the practices of healthcare providers. Greater responsiveness of the health services to MHO members requires cooperation of all actors involved in healthcare delivery to create an enabling environment where voices defending people’s rights are heard."
https://openalex.org/W3017376543,"Background A high salt diet is associated with the development of hypertension, one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors. A reduction in sodium intake seems to have an effect on increasing serum triglycerides (TGs). Elevated TGs are independently linked to cardiovascular risk. However, there is limited evidence of a possible interactive effect of sodium intake and serum TGs on high blood pressure (BP). Methods We conducted a nationwide, population-based interaction analysis using the Kawasaki method for estimating 24-h urinary sodium excretion (e24hUNaEKawasaki) as a candidate indicator of dietary sodium intake. All native Koreans aged 20 years or older without significant medical illness were eligible for inclusion. Results A total of 16936 participants were divided into quintiles according to their e24hUNaEKawasaki results. Participants in the highest quintile were more obese and hypertensive and had higher white blood cell count, lower hemoglobin, greater glycemic exposure, and poor lipid profiles compared to the same parameters of individuals in other quintiles. Linear regression revealed that e24UNaEKawasaki was related to systolic BP, diastolic BP, and TGs. Multiple logistic regression, adjusted for dietary sodium intake and various conventional risk factors for chronic vascular diseases, showed that both e24UNaEKawasaki and TGs were significant predictors of hypertension. Our interaction analysis demonstrated that increased sodium intake was associated with higher risk of hypertension in participants with elevated TGs than in those without (adjusted RERI = 0.022, 95% CI = 0.017–0.027; adjusted AP = 0.017, 95% CI = 0.006–0.028; adjusted SI = 1.010, 95% CI = 1.007–1.014). Conclusion Our findings suggest that the interaction between a high salt diet and elevated TGs may exert synergistic biological effects on the risk of hypertension."

In grasses, the allelic state of Growth Regulating Factor (GRF) gene is correlated with nitrogen uptake. In this study, we characterized the sequence of TaGRF-2D and assessed its diversity in bread wheat and goatgrass Aegilops tauschii (genome DD). In silico analysis was performed for reference sequence searching, primer pairs design and sequence assembly. The gene sequence was obtained using Illumina and Sanger sequencing. The complete sequences of TaGRF-2D were obtained for 18 varieties of wheat. The polymorphism in the presence/absence of two GCAGCC repeats in 5' UTR was revealed and the GRF-2D-SSR marker was developed. Our results showed that the alleles 5' UTR-250 and 5' UTR-238 were present in wheat varieties, 5' UTR-250 was presented in the majority of wheat varieties. In Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata (likely donor of the D-subgenome of polyploid wheat), most accessions carried the 5' UTR-250 allele, whilst most Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii have 5' UTR-244. The developed GRF-2D-SSR marker can be used to study the genetic diversity of wheat and Ae. tauschii."
https://openalex.org/W3016839727,"Hypercholesterolaemia is considered an important cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In a previous investigation, we demonstrated that cultured hepatoma cells treated with hypercholesterolaemic sera compared with cells treated with normocholesterolaemic sera show overexpression of mRNAs related to mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HMGCS2). In the present work, using an NMR metabolomic analysis, we demonstrate that the hypercholesterolaemic blood sera previously used to treat cultured hepatoma cells are characterized by a metabolomic profile that is significantly different from the normocholesterolaemic sera. Acetate, acetone, 2-hydroxybutyrate, cysteine, valine, and glutamine are the metabolites distinguishing the two groups. Abnormalities in the concentrations of these metabolites reflect alterations in energy-related pathways, such as pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, pyruvate, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the citrate cycle, and ketone bodies. Regarding ketone bodies, the pathway is regulated by HMGCS2; therefore, serum samples previously found to be able to increase HMGCS2 mRNA levels in cultured cells also contain higher amounts of the metabolites of its encoded enzyme protein product."
https://openalex.org/W3016959202,"In patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastases, it remains controversial whether the use of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone without radiotherapy (RT) is an optimal approach. Here, we investigated the clinical outcomes according to the use of upfront RT as well as the subsequent therapy following intracranial progression. This single-centre retrospective study included a total of 173 patients who were treated with EGFR-TKI alone (TKI alone group) or with upfront whole-brain RT (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) followed by EGFR-TKI (RT plus TKI group). Clinical outcomes according to initial and subsequent therapies following intracranial progression were analysed. There was no significant difference in OS according to the use of upfront RT (TKI alone group, 24.5 months vs. WBRT group, 20.0 months vs. SRS group, 17.8 months; P = 0.186). Intracranial progression was found in 35 (32.7%) of 107 patients in the TKI alone group. Among them, 19 patients who received salvage RT had the better prognosis than others [median overall survival (OS); 28.6 vs. 11.2 months; P = 0.041]. In the RT plus TKI group, 12 (18.1%) of the 66 patients experienced intracranial progression and 3 of them received salvage RT (median OS; 37.4 vs. 20.0 months; P = 0.044). In multivariate analysis, upfront WBRT was associated with trends towards a lower probability of intracranial progression, whereas upfront SRS was found to be an independent risk factor for poor OS. In conclusion, using EGFR-TKI alone for brain metastasis in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients showed outcomes comparable to those using upfront RT followed by EGFR-TKI. Patients who could not receive salvage RT following intracranial progression had the worst survival regardless of the type of initial treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3016485816,"In agroecosystems, soil biodiversity is increasingly becoming more recognized as providing benefits to both plants and human health. It performs a wide variety of ecological services beyond the recycling of nutrients to plant growth and manage pests and diseases below the economic injury level. This study investigated the effects of three Pseudomonas isolates (Q172B, Q110B and Q036B), isolated from untreated tomato rhizospheric soil, as a biological control agent of Bemisia tabaci which is a key pest of tomato crops. The study was conducted under laboratory and glasshouse conditions and the water treatment was used as a control. Adult mortality rates were assessed during three days at 24h interval and larva mortality rates were evaluated during six days after treatment at 48h interval. Results indicate that Q036B isolate has a faster effect on B. tabaci adult and larvae. Under laboratory conditions, all three Pseudomonas isolates (Q110B, Q036B and Q172B) have a significant effect on B. tabaci adult mortality compared to control. The earliest and the most important mortality rate of 76% was recorded by Q036B. Two isolates Q036B and Q110B caused a significant mortality on B. tabaci larvae; with highest mortality effect (79%) was observed for Q036B compared to control. However, Q172B has no mortality effects on B. tabaci larvae under laboratory conditions. In glasshouse conditions, only Q036B provided high mortality rates of 91% at 168h after treatment. The results of this study indicate that the Pseudomonas isolate Q036B significantly suppresses B. tabaci in tomato plant and could substitute the excessive use of chemicals. Current research indicates that soil biodiversity could be promising to preserve agro-ecological sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3016648719,"In tropical dry forests, although seed germination and seedling establishment are in general limited by the seasonal availability of water, high interspecific variability, nonetheless, exists in terms of seedling traits and germination dynamics. Differences among species in seed germination and seedling traits may be related to other plant life-history traits, such that assessing these relationships may increase our understanding of factors influencing plant establishment, which would affect the regeneration pathways of tropical dry forest communities. In this study, taking into consideration the effect species' phylogeny, we evaluated the relationships of seed germination metrics (percentage, lag time, and rate of germination) and seedling types (i.e. cotyledons functional morphology), with plant life-history traits (growth form, seed mass, dispersal syndrome and dispersal phenology) for 110 species in a Neotropical dry forest in Mexico. A total of 92% of the species studied disperse their seeds during the dry season, mainly at the beginning of this season (66%), a strategy mostly associated with autochorous herbs. Seed germination was more frequent in species that dispersed seeds at the end of the dry season. Germination percentage was not related to any of the traits studied. However, germination lag time and rate were negatively related to seed mass, a trait that in turn depended on growth form and dispersal syndrome. The dominant seedling type in the community was phanerocotylar epigeal with foliaceous cotyledons (56%), which was mostly associated with small seed mass and herbaceous growth form. Our results provide evidence that several plant life-history traits explain an important part of the variation in seed germination and seedling characteristics observed among species. Therefore, these plant life-history traits may be useful for grouping species in terms of their establishment strategies and roles on the regeneration of tropical dry communities."

We investigated the effect of S. japonica feeding during May–July on the improvement of gonad flavor in M. nudus collected from a barren. After feeding, we analyzed the odor-active volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the gonads using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and GC-sniffing analyses and compared to those from the gonads of wild sea urchins from an Eisenia kelp bed (fishing ground) and a barren. A total of 48 VOCs were detected from the gonads of cultured and wild sea urchins. Of them, a larger number of odor-active compounds were detected in the gonads of cultured sea urchins (25) than in those from the Eisenia bed (14) and the barren (6). Dimethyl sulfide from the gonads of sea urchins from the barren was described as having a strong, putrid odor. Sea urchin-like aromas were attributed to 2-butanol, 2-ethylhexanol, benzaldehyde and ethylbenzene from the gonads of cultured sea urchin and those of the Eisenia bed. Kelp feeding decreased the putrid odor from dimethyl sulfide, and enhanced pleasant, sweet aromas."

We retrospectively assessed the condition of keratoconus patients who were followed-up at least twice after the initial examination to evaluate keratoconus progression, to identify definitive factors to predict a later need for corneal crosslinking (CXL).The medical charts of 158 eyes of 158 keratoconus patients (112 males and 46 females; mean age, 27.8 ± 11.7 years), who were followed up at the Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine at least twice after the initial examination to evaluate keratoconus progression were retrospectively reviewed. Best-spectacle corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, steepest corneal axis on the anterior float (Ks), thinnest corneal thickness according to Pentacam® HR, and corneal endothelial cell density were assessed. Gender, age, onset age of keratoconus, history of atopic dermatitis, and Pentacam® indices were also recorded. CXL was performed when the eye showed significant keratoconus progression, an increase in the steepest keratometric value, or an increase in the spherical equivalent or cylinder power of the manifest refraction by more than 1.0 D versus the respective values 2 years prior. Predictor variables and the requirement for CXL were analyzed using logistic regression.Fifty-eight eyes required CXL treatment. The best predictor of the requirement for CXL was patient age, followed by the Pentacam® Rmin (the minimum sagittal curvature evaluated by Pentacam®) value. The incidence of CXL was 86.4% in the < 20 years age group, with an Rmin of ≤ 5.73 mm, whereas 10.8% in the ≥ 27 years age group with an Rmin > 5.73 mm underwent treatment.An age of < 20 years and an Rmin value of ≤ 5.73 mm predicted keratoconus progression and the requirement for CXL treatment in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3016288653,"Objectives Mental health is a largely neglected issue among in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially among key populations at risk for HIV. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of psychological distress (PD) and to assess the factors associated among males who have sex with males (MSM), female sex workers (FSW) and drug users (DU) in Togo in 2017. Study design A cross-sectional bio-behavioral study was conducted in August and September 2017 using a respondent-driven sampling (RDS) method, in eight cities in Togo. Methods A standardized questionnaire was used to record sociodemographic characteristics and sexual behaviors. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and a subset of questions from the Tobacco Questions for Survey were used to assess alcohol and tobacco consumption respectively. PD was assessed with the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. A blood sample was taken to test for HIV. Descriptive statistics, univariable and multivariable ordinal regression models were used for analysis. Results A total of 2044 key populations including 449 DU, 952 FSW and 643 MSM with a median age of 25 years, interquartile range (IQR) [21–32] were recruited. The overall prevalence of mild PD among the three populations was 19.9% (95%CI = [18.3–21.8]) and was 19.2% (95%CI = [17.5–20.9]) for severe/moderate PD. HIV prevalence was 13.7% (95%CI = [12.2–15.2]). High age (≥ 25 years) [aOR = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.02–1.50)], being HIV positive [aOR = 1.80 (95% CI: 1.31–2.48)] and hazardous alcohol consumption [aOR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.22–1.87)] were risk factors for PD. Secondary [aOR = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42–0.64)] or higher [aOR = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.32–0.64)] education levels were protective factors associated with PD. FSW [OR = 0.55 (95% CI: 0.43–0.68)] and MSM [OR = 0.33 (95% CI: 0.24–0.44)] were less likely to report PD compared with DU. Conclusion and recommendations This is the first study conducted among a large, nationally representative sample of key populations in Togo. The prevalence of PD is high among these populations in Togo and was associated to HIV infection. The present study indicates that mental health care must be integrated within health programs in Togo with a special focus to key populations through interventions such as social support groups."
https://openalex.org/W3016921724,"Background Having a physically active lifestyle after cancer diagnosis is beneficial for health, and this needs to be continued into survivorship to optimize long-term benefits. We found that patients, who participated in an 18-week exercise intervention, reported significant higher physical activity (PA) levels 4 years after participation in a randomized controlled trial of supervised exercise delivered during chemotherapy (PACT study). This study aimed to identify social-ecological correlates of PA levels in breast and colon cancer survivors 4 years after participation in the PACT study. Methods Self-reported PA levels and potential correlates (e.g. physical fitness, fatigue, exercise history, and built environment) were assessed in 127 breast and colon cancer survivors shortly after diagnosis (baseline), post-intervention and 4 years later. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify social-ecological correlates of PA 4 years post-baseline. Results The final model revealed that lower baseline physical fatigue (β = -0.25, 95% CI -0.26; -0.24) and higher baseline total PA (0.06, 95% CI, 0.03; 0.10) were correlated with higher total PA levels 4 years post-baseline. Higher baseline leisure and sport PA (0.02, 95% CI 0.01; 0.03), more recreational facilities within a buffer of 1 km (4.05, 95% CI = 1.28; 6.83), lower physical fatigue at 4-year follow-up (-8.07, 95% CI -14.00; -2.13), and having a positive change in physical fatigue during the intervention period (0.04, 95% CI 0.001; 0.07) were correlates of sport and leisure PA levels 4 years post-baseline. Conclusions This study suggests that baseline and 4-year post-baseline physical fatigue, and past exercise behaviour, were significant correlates of PA 4 years after participation in an exercise trial. Additionally, this study suggests that the built environment should be taken into account when promoting PA. Understanding of socio-ecological correlates of PA can provide insights into how future exercise interventions should be designed to promote long-term exercise behaviour.

https://openalex.org/W3017161791,"To determine if findings of ""cartilage icing"" and chondrocalcinosis on knee radiography can differentiate between gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD).IRB-approval was obtained and informed consent was waived for this retrospective study. Electronic medical records from over 2.3 million patients were searched for keywords to identify subjects with knee aspiration-proven cases of gout or CPPD. Radiographs were reviewed by two fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists in randomized order, blinded to the patients' diagnoses. Images were evaluated regarding the presence or absence of cartilage icing, chondrocalcinosis, tophi, gastrocnemius tendon calcification, and joint effusion. Descriptive statistics, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy were calculated.From 49 knee radiographic studies in 46 subjects (31 males and 15 females; mean age 66±13 years), 39% (19/49) showed gout and 61% (30/49) CPPD on aspiration. On knee radiographs, cartilage icing showed a higher sensitivity for CPPD than gout (53-67% and 26%, respectively). Chondrocalcinosis also showed a higher sensitivity for CPPD than gout (50-57% versus 5%), with 95% specificity and 94% positive predictive value for diagnosis of CPPD versus gout. Soft tissue tophus-like opacities were present in gout at the patellar tendon (5%, 1/19) and at the popliteus groove in CPPD (15%, 4/27). Gastrocnemius tendon calcification was present in 30% (8/27) of subjects with CPPD, and 5% (1/19) of gout.In subjects with joint aspiration-proven crystal disease of the knee, the radiographic finding of cartilage icing was seen in both gout and CPPD. Chondrocalcinosis (overall and hyaline cartilage) as well as gastrocnemius tendon calcification positively correlated with the diagnosis of CPPD over gout."
https://openalex.org/W3017169203,"People in romantic relationships often benefit from improved mental and physical health and well-being. Today, these relationships can be recreated using virtual agents. For instance, some people anthropomorphize and fall in love with a virtual partner in a romantic video game. Although previous psychological research has examined anthropomorphized agents, it has neglected virtual romantic relationships. This study aims to examine the desire to play underlying playing romantic video games (RVGs). In Study 1, 43 Japanese participants completed a survey about their desire to play RVGs and their current romantic relationship status. The research revealed that a human-like voice and the use of touch were perceived as important factors in anthropomorphized relationships. In Study 2, an independent sample of 281 Japanese participants replicated the results of Study 1 regarding the importance of voice and touch in RVGs. Moreover, we found that a desire to develop social skills and alleviate negative emotions independently desire to play RVG use. As an important first step, these findings reveal several factors which might contribute to developing a romantic relationship with a virtual agent."
https://openalex.org/W3017227047,"Background The Victorian legislation prohibits sex workers from working when they have visible anogenital herpes or warts. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of asymptomatic female sex workers (FSW) diagnosed with anogenital herpes or warts by genital examination. Methods We analysed all computerised medical records of consultations with FSW at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) in 2018. All asymptomatic sex workers were offered screening sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and a genital examination to identify visible anogenital herpes or warts at MSHC. FSW consultations were categorised into either ‘asymptomatic’ or ‘symptomatic’ based on the presence of symptoms reported by the FSW to the triage nurse. The proportion of asymptomatic FSW diagnosed with visible anogenital herpes or warts during a routine screening examination was calculated. Results In 2018, 4055 consultations were provided to 1979 FSW. 3406 of these consultations were asymptomatic and all were examined by an experienced clinician for signs of STIs. Of these 3406 asymptomatic consultations, seven FSW (0.21%, 95% CI: 0.08% to 0.42%) were diagnosed with visible anogenital herpes and/or warts following a genital examination. Four were diagnosed with warts (0.12%, 95% CI: 0.03% to 0.30%), two with herpes (0.06%, 95% CI: 0.01% to 0.21%) and one with both herpes and warts (0.03%, 95% CI: 0.001% to 0.16%). Conclusion Based on these data, approximately 500 asymptomatic FSW would need to be examined to identify one case of anogenital herpes or warts. Genital examinations consume considerable clinical resources, increase the duration of consultations and provide essentially no significant benefit to the mandated testing for gonorrhoea, chlamydia, HIV and syphilis. Our clinic will use self-collected samples and no longer examine FSW who are asymptomatic."
https://openalex.org/W3016489185,"The giant sugarcane borer Telchin licus (Drury, 1773) (Lepidoptera: Castniidae) is a day-flying moth pest of sugarcane, pineapples and bananas. To better understand the chemical communication in this species, we examined the morphology of its olfactory system and the chemical composition of its body parts. The ventral surface of the clubbed antennae of T. licus has six morphological types of sensilla: sensilla trichodea, basiconica, chaetica, squamiforma, coeloconica, and auricillica. The telescopic ovipositor shows no evidence of a sexual gland, or female-specific compounds. On the other hand, the midleg basitarsus of males releases (E,Z)-2,13-octadecadienol and (Z,E)-2,13-octadecadienol, which are electroantennographically active in both sexes. These compounds are known female sex pheromones in the Sesiidae family and are male-specific compounds in another castniid moth, although further investigations are necessary to elucidate their ecological role in the Castniidae family."
https://openalex.org/W3016994040,"Introduction Cardiac channelopathies are a frequent cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and often manifest with convulsive syncope, leading to a misdiagnosis of epilepsy. We aim to evaluate the clinical impact of epilepsy misdiagnosis in a cohort of patients with cardiac channelopathies. Methods Fifty probands/families with a cardiac channelopathy were included. We retrospectively collected information from medical records to identify all patients who presented with convulsive syncope and were diagnosed with epilepsy after neurological evaluation. Clinical data and outcome were compared with those of patients without a previous epilepsy diagnosis. Results Eight patients had a previous diagnosis of epilepsy. At first episode, 3 of them presented a positive family history of SCD and 5 showed a pathological electrocardiogram; half presented with sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and the rest with recurrent syncope despite treatment with 1 or more anti-epileptic drugs. Five patients had long QT syndrome, 2 had catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and 1 had Brugada syndrome. Epilepsy misdiagnosis was associated with an increased risk of SCA/SCD (OR 6.92, P = .04), a delay of 12 years (P = .047) in correct diagnosis, and a delay from first symptom to channelopathy diagnosis of 18.45 years (P < .0001). Conclusion Cardiac channelopathy patients can be misdiagnosed with epilepsy. This involves a delayed diagnosis, a delay from the first symptom to a correct diagnosis, and an increased risk of SCA/SCD."
https://openalex.org/W3017096391,"Prenatal alcohol-drinking is often measured with self-report, but it is unclear whether mothers give more accurate answers when asked while pregnant or some time after their pregnancy. There is also the question of whether to measure drinking in a dichotomous or continuous fashion. We sought to examine how the timing and scale of self-reports affected the content of reports. From a sample of 576 black mothers around Cape Town, South Africa, we compared prenatal reports of prenatal drinking with 5-year retrospective reports, and dichotomous metrics (drinking or abstinent) with continuous metrics (fluid ounces of absolute alcohol drunk per day). Amounts increased over the 5-year period, whereas dichotomous measures found mothers less likely to report drinking later. All four measures were weakly associated with birth weight, birth height, child head circumference soon after birth, and child intelligence at age 5. Furthermore, neither reporting time nor the scale of measurement were consistently related to the strengths of these associations. Our results point to problems with self-report, particularly with this population, but we recommend post-birth continuous measures as the best of the group for their flexibility and their consistency with previous research."
https://openalex.org/W3017189761,"Although being the golden standard for intrapartum fetal surveillance, cardiotocography (CTG) has been shown to have poor specificity for detecting fetal acidosis. Non-invasive near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring of placental oxygenation during labour has not been studied yet. The objective of the study was to determine whether changes in placental NIRS values during labour could identify intrapartum fetal hypoxia and resulting acidosis. We included 43 healthy women in active stage of labour at term. CTG and NIRS parameters in groups with vs. without neonatal umbilical artery pH ≤ 7.20 were compared using Mann-Whitney-U. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves were used to estimate predictive value of CTG and NIRS parameters for neonatal pH ≤ 7.20. A computer-based statistical classification was also performed to further evaluate predictive values of CTG and NIRS for neonatal acidosis. Ten (23%) neonates were born with umbilical artery pH ≤ 7.20. Compared to group with pH > 7.20, fetal acidosis was associated with more episodes of placental NIRS deoxygenation (9 (range 2–37) vs. 2 (range 0–65); p<0.001), higher velocity of placental NIRS deoxygenation (2.31 (range 0–22) vs. 1 (range 0–49) %/s; p = 0.03), more decelerations on CTG (25 (range 3–91) vs. 10 (range 10–60); p = 0.02), and more prolonged decelerations on CTG (2 (range 0–4) vs. 1 (range 0–3); p = 0.04). Number of placental deoxygenations had the highest prognostic value for fetal/neonatal acidosis (area under the ROC curve 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.70–0.99). Computer-based classification also identified number of placental deoxygenations as the most accurate classifier, with 25% false positive and 93% true positive rate in the training dataset, with 100% accuracy when applied to the testing dataset. Placental deoxygenations during labour measured by NIRS are associated with fetal/neonatal acidosis. Predictive value of placental NIRS for neonatal acidosis was superior to that of CTG."
https://openalex.org/W3017347911,"While primary care providers in New York State (NYS) are mandated to offer all patients a HIV test, still many NYS residents miss the HIV screening opportunity. To fill the gap, and as the CDC recommends, this study aimed to examine the feasibility of implementing HIV screening in dental setting, identify patient characteristics associated with acceptance of HIV rapid testing, and discuss best practices of HIV screening in dental setting. New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) collaborated with the Northeast/Caribbean AIDS Education and Training Center (NECA AETC) and three dental schools in New York State to offer free HIV screening tests as a component of routine dental care between February 2016 and March 2018. Ten clinics in upstate New York and Long Island participated in the study. HIV screening was performed using the OraQuick™ In-Home HIV Test. 14,887 dental patients were offered HIV screening tests; 9,057 (60.8%) were screened; and one patient (0.011%) was confirmed HIV positive and linked to medical care. Of all dental patients, 33% had never been screened for HIV; and 56% had not had a primary care visit or had not been offered an HIV screening test by primary care providers in the previous 12 months. Multi-level generalized linear modeling analysis indicated that test acceptance was significantly associated with patient’s age, race/ethnicity, gender, country of origin, primary payer (or insurance), past primary care visits, past HIV testing experiences, and the poverty level of patient’s community. HIV screening is well accepted by dental patients and can be effectively integrated into routine dental care. HIV screening in the dental setting can be a good option for first-time testers, those who have not seen a primary care provider in the last 12 months, and those who have not been offered HIV screening at their last primary care visit."
https://openalex.org/W3016292371,"Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), also known as low triiodothyronine (T3) syndrome, frequently affects patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and may affect lipid metabolism. Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent and associated with the long-term prognosis of SLE. The aim of the present study was to explore the clinical significance of NTIS on disease activity and dyslipidemia in patients with SLE.Clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively from 223 patients with SLE. The correlation between free triiodothyronine (FT3), SLE disease activity, and lipid profiles were estimated. The correlation coefficient (r) was calculated using a Pearson's regression model. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for dyslipidemia in SLE.Serum FT3 levels were negatively correlated with the levels of 24 h urine protein (UP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr) and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) (all p < 0.001) in NTIS patients but not in euthyroid patients. ApoB/ApoA1 was significantly correlated with SLEDAI (p < 0.01) in NTIS patients and CRP (p < 0.001) and ESR (p < 0.01) in euthyroid patients. A multivariate analysis revealed that only FT3 exhibited an independent negative association with dyslipidemia (P = 0.01; OR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.27-0.85).NTIS frequently occurs in patients with SLE. Low FT3 is associated with disease activity in SLE patients complicated with NTIS. Low FT3 is an independent risk factor for dyslipidemia in patients with SLE."
https://openalex.org/W3016473142,"Background In stroke studies, ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is often used to analyze outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), whereas the non-parametric Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS) has also been suggested. It is unclear how these perform comparatively when confounding adjustment is warranted. Aims Our aim is to quantify the performance of OLR and MWS in different confounding variable settings. Methods We set up a simulation study with three different scenarios; (1) dichotomous confounding variables, (2) continuous confounding variables, and (3) confounding variable settings mimicking a study on functional outcome after stroke. We compared adjusted ordinal logistic regression (aOLR) and stratified Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (sMWS), and also used propensity scores to stratify the MWS (psMWS). For comparability, OLR estimates were transformed to a MWS. We report bias, the percentage of runs that produced a point estimate deviating by more than 0.05 points (point estimate variation), and the coverage probability. Results In scenario 1, there was no bias in both sMWS and aOLR, with similar point estimate variation and coverage probabilities. In scenario 2, sMWS resulted in more bias (0.04 versus 0.00), and higher point estimate variation (41.6% versus 3.3%), whereas coverage probabilities were similar. In scenario 3, there was no bias in both methods, point estimate variation was higher in the sMWS (6.7%) versus aOLR (1.1%), and coverage probabilities were 0.98 (sMWS) versus 0.95 (aOLR). With psMWS, bias remained 0.00, with less point estimate variation (1.5%) and a coverage probability of 0.95. Conclusions The bias of both adjustment methods was similar in our stroke simulation scenario, and the higher point estimate variation in the MWS improved with propensity score based stratification. The stratified MWS is a valid alternative for adjusted OLR only when the ratio of number of strata versus number of observations is relatively low, but propensity score based stratification extends the application range of the MWS."
https://openalex.org/W3017339948,"Lemna species have been used in the food, feed, and pharmaceutical industries, as they are inexpensive sources of proteins, starches, and fatty acids. In this study, we treated L. paucicostata with different concentrations (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, or 1 mM) of ethephon. The total dry weight decreased in all ethephon-treated groups compared to the control group. We also investigated the alteration of metabolic profiles induced by ethephon treatment by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This analysis identified 48 metabolites, and the relative levels of most of alcohols, amino acids, fatty acids, and phenols increased by the ethephon treatment, whereas levels of organic acids and sugars decreased. Among these, the highest production of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA, 5.041 ± 1.373 mg/L) and ferulic acid (0.640 ± 0.071 mg/L) was observed in the 0.5 mM and the 0.2 mM ethephon treatment groups, respectively. These results could be useful for large-scale culture of L. paucicostata with enhanced GABA and ferulic acid content for utilization in the food, feed, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries."
https://openalex.org/W3016374893,"The impact of damaged sidewalls at the joints between tubes on dam structures subjected to horizontal seepage is investigated. First, an experimental scheme is designed to test the mode and critical gradient of seepage failure of the soil in the damaged tubes. The effects of various overburden pressures (0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 kPa), hole radii(0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 cm) and soil specimen properties were studied. The test phenomena and the changes in the pore water pressure were used to determine the seepage failure modes and the critical gradients under different conditions. Combined with the modified Terzaghi soil arching theory, a mathematical model was developed for the critical gradient for soil seepage failure. The model fitting curve was in good agreement with the laboratory test results. The critical gradient is independent of the overburden pressure and weakly dependent on the internal friction angle of the soil. The critical gradient increases with the cohesion. For fixed characteristic soil parameters, the critical gradient decreases at a gradually decreasing rate as the radius of the damaged hole increases."
