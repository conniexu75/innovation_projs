https://openalex.org/W2042941777,"Amorphous metal oxides are useful in optical, electronic and electrochemical devices. The bonding arrangement within these glasses largely determines their properties, yet it remains a challenge to manipulate their structures in a controlled manner. Recently, we developed synthetic protocols for incorporating nanocrystals that are covalently bonded into amorphous materials. This 'nanocrystal-in-glass' approach not only combines two functional components in one material, but also the covalent link enables us to manipulate the glass structure to change its properties. Here we illustrate the power of this approach by introducing tin-doped indium oxide nanocrystals into niobium oxide glass (NbOx), and realize a new amorphous structure as a consequence of linking it to the nanocrystals. The resulting material demonstrates a previously unrealized optical switching behaviour that will enable the dynamic control of solar radiation transmittance through windows. These transparent films can block near-infrared and visible light selectively and independently by varying the applied electrochemical voltage over a range of 2.5 volts. We also show that the reconstructed NbOx glass has superior properties-its optical contrast is enhanced fivefold and it has excellent electrochemical stability, with 96 per cent of charge capacity retained after 2,000 cycles."

Despite advances in sequence-based microbial profiling and myriad studies defining microbiome composition during health and disease, little is known about the molecular processes used by symbiotic bacteria to stably colonize the gastrointestinal tract. We sought to define how mammals assemble and maintain the Bacteroides, one of the most numerically prominent genera of the human microbiome. Here we find that, whereas the gut normally contains hundreds of bacterial species, germ-free mice mono-associated with a single Bacteroides species are resistant to colonization by the same, but not different, species. To identify bacterial mechanisms for species-specific saturable colonization, we devised an in vivo genetic screen and discovered a unique class of polysaccharide utilization loci that is conserved among intestinal Bacteroides. We named this genetic locus the commensal colonization factors (ccf). Deletion of the ccf genes in the model symbiont, Bacteroides fragilis, results in colonization defects in mice and reduced horizontal transmission. The ccf genes of B. fragilis are upregulated during gut colonization, preferentially at the colonic surface. When we visualize microbial biogeography within the colon, B. fragilis penetrates the colonic mucus and resides deep within crypt channels, whereas ccf mutants are defective in crypt association. Notably, the CCF system is required for B. fragilis colonization following microbiome disruption with Citrobacter rodentium infection or antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the niche within colonic crypts represents a reservoir for bacteria to maintain long-term colonization. These findings reveal that intestinal Bacteroides have evolved species-specific physical interactions with the host that mediate stable and resilient gut colonization, and the CCF system represents a novel molecular mechanism for symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2090548255,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progresses from compensated insulin resistance to beta cell failure resulting in uncompensated hyperglycemia, a process replicated in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. The Nlrp3 inflammasome has been implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance and beta cell failure. Endocannabinoids contribute to insulin resistance through activation of peripheral CB1 receptors (CB₁Rs) and also promote beta cell failure. Here we show that beta cell failure in adult ZDF rats is not associated with CB₁R signaling in beta cells, but rather in M1 macrophages infiltrating into pancreatic islets, and that this leads to activation of the Nlrp3-ASC inflammasome in the macrophages. These effects are replicated in vitro by incubating wild-type human or rodent macrophages, but not macrophages from CB₁R-deficient (Cnr1(-/-)) or Nlrp3(-/-) mice, with the endocannabinoid anandamide. Peripheral CB₁R blockade, in vivo depletion of macrophages or macrophage-specific knockdown of CB₁R reverses or prevents these changes and restores normoglycemia and glucose-induced insulin secretion. These findings implicate endocannabinoids and inflammasome activation in beta cell failure and identify macrophage-expressed CB₁R as a therapeutic target in T2DM."

https://openalex.org/W2003115684,"Heiko Witt, Miklós Sahin-Tóth and colleagues show that loss-of-function variants in CPA1 are strongly associated with early onset chronic pancreatitis. On the basis of their findings, they propose that the mechanism may involve misfolding-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress rather than elevated trypsin activity. Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory disorder of the pancreas. We analyzed CPA1, encoding carboxypeptidase A1, in subjects with nonalcoholic chronic pancreatitis (cases) and controls in a German discovery set and three replication sets. Functionally impaired variants were present in 29/944 (3.1%) German cases and 5/3,938 (0.1%) controls (odds ratio (OR) = 24.9, P = 1.5 × 10−16). The association was strongest in subjects aged ≤10 years (9.7%; OR = 84.0, P = 4.1 × 10−24). In the replication sets, defective CPA1 variants were present in 8/600 (1.3%) cases and 9/2,432 (0.4%) controls from Europe (P = 0.01), 5/230 (2.2%) cases and 0/264 controls from India (P = 0.02) and 5/247 (2.0%) cases and 0/341 controls from Japan (P = 0.013). The mechanism by which CPA1 variants confer increased pancreatitis risk may involve misfolding-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress rather than elevated trypsin activity, as is seen with other genetic risk factors for this disease."

https://openalex.org/W2110645671,"The continuous-variable teleportation of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit is deterministic and allows for faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect continuous-variable entangled states: for four qubits, the overall transfer fidelities all exceed the classical limit of teleportation. Quantum teleportation is one of the most important elementary protocols in quantum information processing. Previous studies have achieved quantum teleportation, but usually randomly and at low rates. Two groups reporting in this issue of Nature have used contrasting methods to achieve the same aim —more efficient quantum teleportation. Takeda et al. describe the experimental realization of fully deterministic, unconditional quantum teleportation of photonic qubits — an optimum choice for information carrying — with overall transfer fidelities exceeding the classical limit of teleportation. The technique may facilitate the development of large-scale optical quantum networks. Steffen et al. report quantum teleportation in a solid-state system, achieving deterministic quantum teleportation in a chip-based superconducting circuit architecture. They teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a rate of 10,000 per second, exceeding other reported implementations. Transmission loss in superconducting waveguides is low, so this system should be scalable to significantly larger distances, a step towards quantum communication at microwave frequencies. Quantum teleportation1 allows for the transfer of arbitrary unknown quantum states from a sender to a spatially distant receiver, provided that the two parties share an entangled state and can communicate classically. It is the essence of many sophisticated protocols for quantum communication and computation2,3,4,5. Photons are an optimal choice for carrying information in the form of ‘flying qubits’, but the teleportation of photonic quantum bits6,7,8,9,10,11 (qubits) has been limited by experimental inefficiencies and restrictions. Main disadvantages include the fundamentally probabilistic nature of linear-optics Bell measurements12, as well as the need either to destroy the teleported qubit or attenuate the input qubit when the detectors do not resolve photon numbers13. Here we experimentally realize fully deterministic quantum teleportation of photonic qubits without post-selection. The key step is to make use of a hybrid technique involving continuous-variable teleportation14,15,16 of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit. When the receiver’s feedforward gain is optimally tuned, the continuous-variable teleporter acts as a pure loss channel17,18, and the input dual-rail-encoded qubit, based on a single photon, represents a quantum error detection code against photon loss19 and hence remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for a faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect continuous-variable entangled states: for four qubits the overall transfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 and all of them exceed the classical limit of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a relatively low level of the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more efficiently than in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into account only the qubit subspaces), and with a fidelity comparable to the previously reported values."
https://openalex.org/W2003108613,"Subcellular localization is emerging as an important mechanism for mTORC1 regulation. We report that the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) signalling node, TSC1, TSC2 and Rheb, localizes to peroxisomes, where it regulates mTORC1 in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). TSC1 and TSC2 were bound by peroxisomal biogenesis factors 19 and 5 (PEX19 and PEX5), respectively, and peroxisome-localized TSC functioned as a Rheb GTPase-activating protein (GAP) to suppress mTORC1 and induce autophagy. Naturally occurring pathogenic mutations in TSC2 decreased PEX5 binding, and abrogated peroxisome localization, Rheb GAP activity and suppression of mTORC1 by ROS. Cells lacking peroxisomes were deficient in mTORC1 repression by ROS, and peroxisome-localization-deficient TSC2 mutants caused polarity defects and formation of multiple axons in neurons. These data identify a role for the TSC in responding to ROS at the peroxisome, and identify the peroxisome as a signalling organelle involved in regulation of mTORC1. Reactive oxygen species inhibit mTORC1 signalling, but the subcellular localization of this event has been unclear. Walker and colleagues show that the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is located at the peroxisome, where it functions as a Rheb GTPase-activator protein to suppress mTORC1 and induce autophagy. They also show that disease-associated mutations in TCS2 display impaired peroxisome localization and mTORC1 repression."
https://openalex.org/W2152429022,Transferring the state of an information carrier from a sender to a receiver is an essential primitive in both classical and quantum communication and information processing. In a quantum process known as teleportation the unknown state of a quantum bit can be relayed to a distant party using shared entanglement and classical information. Here we present experiments in a solid-state system based on superconducting quantum circuits demonstrating the teleportation of the state of a qubit at the macroscopic scale. In our experiments teleportation is realized deterministically with high efficiency and achieves a high rate of transferred qubit states. This constitutes a significant step towards the realization of repeaters for quantum communication at microwave frequencies and broadens the tool set for quantum information processing with superconducting circuits.
https://openalex.org/W2062875932,"Measurement of vessel caliber by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable technique for in vivo monitoring of hemodynamic status and vascular development, especially in the brain. Here, we introduce a new paradigm in MRI termed vessel architectural imaging (VAI) that exploits an overlooked temporal shift in the magnetic resonance signal, forming the basis for vessel caliber estimation, and show how this phenomenon can reveal new information on vessel type and function not assessed by any other noninvasive imaging technique. We also show how this biomarker can provide new biological insights into the treatment of patients with cancer. As an example, we demonstrate using VAI that anti-angiogenic therapy can improve microcirculation and oxygen saturation and reduce vessel calibers in patients with recurrent glioblastomas and, more crucially, that patients with these responses have prolonged survival. Thus, VAI has the potential to identify patients who would benefit from therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2000372473,"Persistent neural activity in the absence of a stimulus has been identified as a neural correlate of working memory, but how such activity is maintained by neocortical circuits remains unknown. We used a computational approach to show that the inhibitory and excitatory microcircuitry of neocortical memory-storing regions is sufficient to implement a corrective feedback mechanism that enables persistent activity to be maintained stably for prolonged durations. When recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs to memory neurons were balanced in strength and offset in time, drifts in activity triggered a corrective signal that counteracted memory decay. Circuits containing this mechanism temporally integrated their inputs, generated the irregular neural firing observed during persistent activity and were robust against common perturbations that severely disrupted previous models of short-term memory storage. These results reveal a mechanism for the accumulation and storage of memories in neocortical circuits based on principles of corrective negative feedback that are widely used in engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W1992375755,"Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)(+) T regulatory (T(reg)) cells maintain immune homeostasis and limit autoimmunity but can also curtail host immune responses to various types of tumors. Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells are therefore considered promising targets to enhance antitumor immunity, and approaches for their therapeutic modulation are being developed. However, although studies showing that experimentally depleting Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells can enhance antitumor responses provide proof of principle, these studies lack clear translational potential and have various shortcomings. Histone/protein acetyltransferases (HATs) promote chromatin accessibility, gene transcription and the function of multiple transcription factors and nonhistone proteins. We now report that conditional deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of one HAT, p300 (also known as Ep300 or KAT3B), in Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells increased T cell receptor-induced apoptosis in T(reg) cells, impaired T(reg) cell suppressive function and peripheral T(reg) cell induction, and limited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice. Our data thereby demonstrate that p300 is important for Foxp3(+) T(reg) cell function and homeostasis in vivo and in vitro, and identify mechanisms by which appropriate small-molecule inhibitors can diminish T(reg) cell function without overtly impairing T effector cell responses or inducing autoimmunity. Collectively, these data suggest a new approach for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2092342272,"Soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are slowly rotating, isolated neutron stars that sporadically undergo episodes of long-term flux enhancement (outbursts) generally accompanied by the emission of short bursts of hard X-rays. This behaviour can be understood in the magnetar model, according to which these sources are mainly powered by their own magnetic energy. This is supported by the fact that the magnetic fields inferred from several observed properties of AXPs and SGRs are greater than - or at the high end of the range of - those of radio pulsars. In the peculiar case of SGR 0418+5729, a weak dipole magnetic moment is derived from its timing parameters, whereas a strong field has been proposed to reside in the stellar interior and in multipole components on the surface. Here we show that the X-ray spectrum of SGR 0418+5729 has an absorption line, the properties of which depend strongly on the star's rotational phase. This line is interpreted as a proton cyclotron feature and its energy implies a magnetic field ranging from 2E14 gauss to more than 1E15 gauss."
https://openalex.org/W2096528381,"Hox genes controlling motor neuron subtype identity are expressed in rostrocaudal patterns that are spatially and temporally collinear with their chromosomal organization. Here we demonstrate that Hox chromatin is subdivided into discrete domains that are controlled by rostrocaudal patterning signals that trigger rapid, domain-wide clearance of repressive histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) polycomb modifications. Treatment of differentiating mouse neural progenitors with retinoic acid leads to activation and binding of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) to the Hox1-Hox5 chromatin domains, which is followed by a rapid domain-wide removal of H3K27me3 and acquisition of cervical spinal identity. Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals induce expression of the Cdx2 transcription factor that binds and clears H3K27me3 from the Hox1-Hox9 chromatin domains, leading to specification of brachial or thoracic spinal identity. We propose that rapid clearance of repressive modifications in response to transient patterning signals encodes global rostrocaudal neural identity and that maintenance of these chromatin domains ensures the transmission of positional identity to postmitotic motor neurons later in development."
https://openalex.org/W2170262834,"During vertebrate mitosis, the centromere-associated kinesin CENP-E (centromere protein E) transports misaligned chromosomes to the plus ends of spindle microtubules. Subsequently, the kinetochores that form at the centromeres establish stable associations with microtubule ends, which assemble and disassemble dynamically. Here we provide evidence that after chromosomes have congressed and bi-oriented, the CENP-E motor continues to play an active role at kinetochores, enhancing their links with dynamic microtubule ends. Using a combination of single-molecule approaches and laser trapping in vitro, we demonstrate that once reaching microtubule ends, CENP-E converts from a lateral transporter into a microtubule tip-tracker that maintains association with both assembling and disassembling microtubule tips. Computational modelling of this behaviour supports our proposal that CENP-E tip-tracks bi-directionally through a tethered motor mechanism, which relies on both the motor and tail domains of CENP-E. Our results provide a molecular framework for the contribution of CENP-E to the stability of attachments between kinetochores and dynamic microtubule ends. Grishchuk and colleagues report that CENP-E, which is known to transport chromosomes towards the plus end of spindle microtubules, is also able to track microtubule tips bi-directionally."

https://openalex.org/W2061551128,"Binding of the macrophage lectin mincle to trehalose dimycolate, a key glycolipid virulence factor on the surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, initiates responses that can lead both to toxicity and to protection of these pathogens from destruction. Crystallographic structural analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and binding studies with glycolipid mimics have been used to define an extended binding site in the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of bovine mincle that encompasses both the headgroup and a portion of the attached acyl chains. One glucose residue of the trehalose Glcα1-1Glcα headgroup is liganded to a Ca(2+) in a manner common to many C-type CRDs, whereas the second glucose residue is accommodated in a novel secondary binding site. The additional contacts in the secondary site lead to a 36-fold higher affinity for trehalose compared with glucose. An adjacent hydrophobic groove, not seen in other C-type CRDs, provides a docking site for one of the acyl chains attached to the trehalose, which can be targeted with small molecule analogs of trehalose dimycolate that bind with 52-fold higher affinity than trehalose. The data demonstrate how mincle bridges between the surfaces of the macrophage and the mycobacterium and suggest the possibility of disrupting this interaction.

The N-terminal domain of angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) inhibits LPL activity. ANGPTL4 was previously described as an unfolding molecular chaperone of LPL that catalytically converts active LPL dimers into inactive monomers. Our studies show that ANGPTL4 is more accurately described as a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor of LPL. We find that inhibited LPL is in a complex with ANGPTL4, and upon dissociation, LPL regains lipase activity. Furthermore, we have generated a variant of ANGPTL4 that is dependent on divalent cations for its ability to inhibit LPL. We show that LPL inactivation by this regulatable variant of ANGPTL4 is fully reversible after treatment with a chelator."

Estrogen (estradiol-17β) has long been recognized as a neurotropic agent, affording neuroprotection in several in vitro and in vivo models of injury and neurodegenerative diseases (13.Merchenthaler I. Dellovade T.L. Shughrue P.J. Neuroprotection by estrogen in animal models of global and focal ischemia.Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Basic mechanisms and clinical implications.Steroids. 2007; 72: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). However, the therapeutic efficacy of estrogen is limited because its long term use increases the risk of breast and uterine cancers, coronary heart disease, and stroke (15.Shao B. Cheng Y. Jin K. Estrogen, neuroprotection and neurogenesis after ischemic stroke.Curr. Drug Targets. 2012; 13: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen (TX) and raloxifene have gained attention as potential alternatives to estrogen therapy. TX affords neuroprotection in animal models of cerebral ischemia (16.Zhang Y. Jin Y. Behr M.J. Feustel P.J. Morrison J.P. Kimelberg H.K. Behavioral and histological neuroprotection by tamoxifen after reversible focal cerebral ischemia.Exp Neurol. 2005; 196: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), stroke (17.Mehta S.H.

Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, reduces ischemic damage caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion in the ovariectomized female rat.Neuroendocrinology. 2003; 77: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and Parkinson disease (18.Dluzen D.E. McDermott J.L. Anderson L.I. Tamoxifen diminishes methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine depletion in intact female and male mice.J Neuroendocrinology. 2001; 13: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism(s) of its neuroprotection have yet to be understood. Several studies have attributed the antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties of TX to its neuroprotection, whereas others have shown that TX inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids such as glutamate (19.Kimelberg H.K. Feustel P.J. Jin Y. Paquette J. Boulos A. Keller Jr., R.W. Tranmer B.I.

Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Growth factors are known modulators of the expression and function of glutamate transporters (21.Koeberle P.D. Bähr M. The upregulation of GLAST-1 is an indirect antiapoptotic mechanism of GDNF and neurturin in the adult CNS.Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). TGF-β, which is released from astrocytes in response to estrogen or TX, mediates the neuroprotective effects of both estrogen and TX (22.Dhandapani K.M. Wade F.M. Mahesh V.B. Brann D.W. Astrocyte-derived transforming growth factor-β mediates the neuroprotective effects of 17β-estradiol. Involvement of nonclassical genomic signaling pathways.Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 2749-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). TGF-α has also been shown to afford protection in cerebral artery occlusion and cerebral ischemia models (23.Justicia C. Pérez-Asensio F.J. Burguete M.C. Salom J.B. Planas A.M. Administration of transforming growth factor-α reduces infarct volume after transient focal cerebral ischemia in the rat.J. Cereb.

Transforming growth factor-α acting at the epidermal growth factor receptor reduces infarct volume after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1999; 19: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both EGF and TGF-α induce GLT-1 expression via NF-κB activation in astrocytes (25.Zelenaia O. Schlag B.D. Gochenauer G.E. Ganel R. Song W. Beesley J.S. Grinspan J.B. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. Epidermal growth factor receptor agonists increase expression of glutamate transporter GLT-1 in astrocytes through pathways dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and transcription factor NF-κB.Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In our previous study, we showed that estrogen and TX induced up-regulation of GLT-1 via TGF-α (26.Lee E. Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz M. Yin Z. Webb A. Son D.S. Aschner M. Transforming growth factor-α mediates estrogen-induced upregulation of glutamate transporter GLT-1 in rat primary astrocytes.Glia. 2012; 60: 1024-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To further characterize the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in TX-induced up-regulation of GLT-1, we investigated the role of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and NF-κB in TX-induced GLT-1 up-regulation. Our results demonstrate that both the CREB and NF-κB pathways are critical for TX-induced enhancement of GLT-1 expression. Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. TGF-α was from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). PP2, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, H89, G15, and G1 were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). Estrogen, dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), protease inhibitor mixture, and poly-D-ornithine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). GLT-1, TGF-α, CREB, NF-κB, β-actin, and Src antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) or Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The RNA isolation kit was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The luciferase reporter assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). All chemicals were prepared in Hanks' buffered salt solution, 95% ethanol, or dimethyl sulfoxide according to the instructions of the manufacturer and diluted to final working concentrations in Opti-MEM prior to use. Astrocyte cultures were prepared as described previously (27.Aschner M. Gannon M. Kimelberg H.K. Manganese uptake and efflux in cultured rat astrocytes.J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 730-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, after carefully removing the meninges, cerebral cortices of newborn (1-day-old) Sprague-Dawley rats were digested with dispase (Invitrogen). Astrocytes were then recovered by the repeated removal of dissociated cells and plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. Twenty-four hours after the initial plating, the medium was changed to preserve the adhering astrocytes and to remove neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator for 3 weeks in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. These cultures showed > 95% positive staining for the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein. All experiments were performed 3 weeks post-isolation. Whole cell lysates for SDS-PAGE were prepared as described previously (28.Lee E. Sidoryk-Wêgrzynowicz M. Wang N. Webb A. Son D.S. Lee K. Aschner M. GPR30 regulates glutamate transporter GLT-1 expression in rat primary astrocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26817-26828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were treated with the designated compounds for the indicated time periods, followed by two washes with cold Hanks' buffered salt solution. Subsequently, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The protein concentration in the lysate was determined with BCA. Next, 30 μg of protein samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using primary antibodies (GLT-1, 1:1000, Millipore or Santa Cruz Biotechnology; β-actin, 1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich), phospho-CREB, CREB (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by secondary antibodies (1:3000, anti-rabbit, anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugates; Promega). The immunoreactive proteins were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection kit (Pierce). The GLT-1 (EAAT2) promoter containing −954 to +44 bp (954) sequences subcloned into the pGL3 basic plasmid vector (9.Guo H. Lai L. Butchbach M.E. Stockinger M.P. Shan X. Bishop G.A. Lin C.L. Increased expression of the glial glutamate transporter EAAT2 modulates excitotoxicity and delays the onset but not the outcome of ALS in mice.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2519-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was used as the original template for mutations. The NF-κB triple mutant (-583/-272/-251) was a gift from Dr. Sitcheran (Texas A&M Health Sciences Center). To generate a mutation at the −308 CREB binding site, the sequence 5′-GCC CGG CGC GGG TGA TGT CAG CTC TCG ACG AAA-3′ was changed to 5′-GCC CGG CGC GGG TAA TGA CAG CTC TCG ACG AAA-3′ by PCR-based mutagenesis using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Clones were sequenced to confirm the mutations. Deletion constructs were generated from the EAAT2–954 (-954/+44) pGL3-basic vector. PCR was performed for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, at 58 °C for 1 min, and at 74 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 74 °C for 10 min using the following primers attached with the XhoI and HindIII sites: 5′-ACT ATT CTC GAG GGA GAC GGA GGG GCA TCC CGG-3′ for the −590/+44 deleted construct (EAAT2–590), 5′-ATT ACC CTC GAG CGG CGC GGG TGA TGT CAG CTC-3′ for the −315/+44 deleted construct (EAAT2–315), 5′-GCC CTC GAG CGA AAA TAG AGA GGG ATC GCC-3′ for the −290/+44 deleted construct (EAAT2–290), 5′-ACC CTC GAG CTG CAA ATC CCC AGC TCC GGC-3′ for the −270/+44 deleted construct (EAAT2–270), and 5′-5-GCC GCC AAG CTT TGG CTT CCC CGA GAG AGC GAT-3′ for a reverse primer. The amplified EAAT2 DNA fragments were subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector. The sequences of the new constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A 990-bp DNA fragment from −950 to +40 of the human TGF-α gene was generated by PCR using human genomic DNA. Primer sets were designed as follows: 5′-ATT CTC GAG GCA CCA GGG GCC ACC TCA GAG-3′ for sense containing the XhoI site and 5′-GCC AAG CTT GCT CTC CAG CCT CCT GCC CTA-3′ for antisense containing the HindIII site. The amplified TGF-α DNA fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII, and the fragment was purified according to the instructions of the manufacturer (gel extraction system, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified TGFα promoter was subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The sequence of the TGF-α promoter construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Astrocytes cultured in 500 μl of growth medium in 24-well plates for 2–3 days were transfected overnight with 0.5 μg of the pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector containing EAAT2Pro-954 (EAAT2, provided by Dr. Fisher, Virginia Commonwealth University), various mutants of EAAT2, or TGF-α with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in minimal essential medium containing 5% FBS. For some experiments, astrocytes were cotransfected with the luciferase vector and expression vectors (100 ng) such as pRC/RSV-CREB, pCMV-A-CREB, pcDNA-p50, pRC/RSV-p65, and pCMV-IκB-α. Empty vectors of the corresponding expression vectors were used as controls. Luciferase reporter vectors for NF-κB and CRE were purchased from Clontech. After transfection, astrocytes were treated with the designated compounds in Opti-MEM for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured with the Bright-Glo luciferase kit (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer and normalized to the protein content (Bradford protein assay, Bio-Rad). Normalization with protein content was verified by cotransfection of astrocytes with luciferase vectors and firefly reporter pGL4.75 plasmids (Promega) carrying the Renilla luciferase reporter gene. The total RNA extraction from astrocytes was performed with the RNeasy mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). 2 μg of total RNA was transcribed with poly(dT) oligonucleotides. The primers for GLT-1 and TGF-α were designed as follows: 5′-CCT CAT GAG GAT GCT GAA GA-3′ (GLT-1 forward) and 5′-TCC AGG AAG GCA TCC AGG CTG-3′ (GLT-1 reverse); 5′-ACG GTC ACT GCT GTC ATT G-3′ (TGF-α forward) and 5′-GCG CTG GGC TTC TCG TG-3′ (TGF-α reverse); and 5′-TCC CTC AAG ATT GTC AGC AA-3′ (GAPDH forward) and 5′-AGA TCC ACA ACG GAT ACA TT-3′ (GAPDH reverse). The CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) was used to amplify TGF-α. The reactions were carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing 1 μg of cDNA template of each sample, 0.4 μm of the appropriate primers, and RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences/Qiagen). The PCR protocol consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. All samples were normalized relative to GAPDH. A web-based PCR array data analysis (SA Biosciences/Qiagen) was used for data analysis. ChIP analysis was performed with the EZ-ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Millipore) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with formaldehyde (10 min at room temperature) and sonicated to lengths of 100–500 bp. Next, 100 μl of supernatant was mixed with 900 μl of ChIP dilution buffer. After preclearing, 1% of the reaction was saved for PCR amplification as input. The remainder was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the CREB antibody (Cell Signaling), p50 (Cell Signaling Technology), p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or control rabbit IgG (Millipore). After isolation and washing of antibody-containing complexes, DNA was extracted. PCRs were performed using the following primers: CREB, 5′-GGG ACA ACA GAA GAG GGA CA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGG GAT TGC AAG GTT TAG CC-3′ (reverse); NF-κB, 5′-CTG TGG GAC TCC CCA TCC CAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGG CAG GAT CCC AGG GTC TAA-3′ (reverse). PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and visualized under UV light. EMSA was performed using the LightShift chemiluminescent kit from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 μg of nuclear extract from control or treated astrocytes was incubated for 20 min on ice with biotin-labeled oligos containing NF-κB or CREB binding sites of the EAAT2 promoter. In some reactions, 10 μg of antibody was added prior to the reaction. Next, DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 8% non-denaturing DNA polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nylon membrane. The complexes were detected with the chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module from Thermo Scientific. The primer pairs used for NF-κB (EAAT2 −583) were as follows: 5′-GGA GAC GGA GGG GCA TCC CGG GTC TCC GC-3′ and 5′-GCG GAG ACC CGG GAT GCC CCT CCG TCT CC-3′. The primer pairs used for CRE (EAAT2 −308) were as follows: 5′-CGG CGC GGG TGA TGT CAG CTC TCG ACG AAA-3′ and 5′-TTT CGT CGA GAG CTG ACA TCA CCC GCG CCG-3′. All oligos were HPLC-purified and biotin-labeled (Operon Technologies). A DNA affinity purification assay was performed with a Factor Finder kit from Miltenyi Biotec, Inc. (Auburn, CA). Briefly, 1.5 μg of biotinylated oligos (the same sequences as for EMSA) were incubated with 50 μg of nuclear extract in binding buffer for 20 min. Next, 100 μl of streptavidin microbeads were added and further incubated for 10 min. The reaction mixture was applied onto the microcolumn, which was equilibrated with binding buffer and set in the magnetic field. After washing four times with 100 μl of low-salt and high-salt buffers each, bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of elution buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. The mean and S.E. were determined for each data set. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test was used to determine significance. Student's t test was used for two sets of data to determine significance. p < 0.05 was considered to represent statistically significant differences. Several growth factors, including EGF and basic fibroblast growth factor, increase GLT-1 expression in astrocytes (29.Miller S. Romano C. Cotman C.W. Growth factor upregulation of a phosphoinositide-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor in cortical astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6103-6109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Vermeiren C.

Neurochem. 2005; 94: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, estrogen increases GLT-1 and glutamate aspartate transporter expression, thereby enhancing astrocytic glutamate uptake (31.Lee E.S. Sidoryk M. Jiang H. Yin Z. Aschner M. Estrogen and tamoxifen reverse manganese-induced glutamate transporter impairment in astrocytes.J. Neurochem. 2009; 110: 530-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32.Pawlak J. Brito V. Küppers E. Beyer C. Regulation of glutamate transporter GLAST and GLT-1 expression in astrocytes by estrogen.Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 138: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our previous study established that both estrogen- and TX-induced astrocytic GLT-1 expression was mediated by TGF-α signaling upon 24 h exposure (26.Lee E. Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz M. Yin Z. Webb A. Son D.S. Aschner M. Transforming growth factor-α mediates estrogen-induced upregulation of glutamate transporter GLT-1 in rat primary astrocytes.Glia. 2012; 60: 1024-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given that EGF or neuron-dependent activation require a prolonged period of time to induce GLT-1 expression (33.Ghosh M. Yang Y. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. Nuclear factor-κB contributes to neuron-dependent induction of glutamate transporter-1 expression in astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 9159-9169Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), this study assessed the effects of TX on astrocytic GLT-1 protein levels after 6-day treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A, both TX and TGF-α induced a significant increase of astrocytic GLT-1 protein expression at this time point. dbcAMP was used as a positive control. The time course study revealed that TX induced GLT-1 protein expression as early as 30 min post-treatment and continuously for 6 days (data not shown). TX also increased GLT-1 mRNA (Fig. 1B) and TGF-α mRNA (Fig. 1C) levels, showing a significant increase within 4 h of incubation, in agreement with our previous findings (26.Lee E. Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz M. Yin Z. Webb A. Son D.S. Aschner M. Transforming growth factor-α mediates estrogen-induced upregulation of glutamate transporter GLT-1 in rat primary astrocytes.Glia. 2012; 60: 1024-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Analogous to the TX-induced GLT-1 protein increase, GLT-1 mRNA was also continuously increased up to 6 days post-treatment (data not shown). TX also significantly increased TGF-α promoter activity (p < 0.05, Fig. 1D). Moreover, blocking the TGF-α receptor, EGF receptor (EGFR), with AG1478 completely abrogated the TX-induced GLT-1 promoter activity, suggesting a possible role of TGF-α in this process (Fig. 1E). The CREB-regulated transcriptional machinery provides neuroprotection against ischemia (34.Hara T. Hamada J. Yano S. Morioka M. Kai Y. Ushio Y. CREB is required for acquisition of ischemic tolerance in gerbil hippocampal CA1 region.J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the GLT-1 and TGF-α promoters contain one CRE consensus site, and CRE-mutation on the GLT-1 promoter decreases its activity (28.Lee E. Sidoryk-Wêgrzynowicz M. Wang N. Webb A. Son D.S. Lee K. Aschner M. GPR30 regulates glutamate transporter GLT-1 expression in rat primary astrocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26817-26828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, we tested whether the CREB pathway plays a role in TX-induced regulation of GLT-1. As shown in Fig. 2A, both TX and TGF-α increased CRE reporter activity to levels comparable with dbcAMP (a positive control). The activation of CREB is triggered by PKA, and estrogen has been shown to induce this pathway (35.Lee B. Butcher G.Q. Hoyt K.R. Impey S. Obrietan K. Activity-dependent neuroprotection and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Kinase coupling, stimulus intensity, and temporal regulation of CREB phosphorylation at serine 133.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether the PKA pathway is involved in TX-induced CREB activation using H89, a PKA inhibitor. Inhibition of PKA significantly attenuated the effect of TX or TGF-α on EAAT2 promoter activity (Fig. 2, B and C). Overexpression of CREB significantly increased EAAT2 promoter activity (Fig. 2D). Previous studies reported that NF-κB played a critical role in the positive regulation of EAAT2 promoter activity (36.Su Z.Z. Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.C. Sarkar D. Chao W. Volsky D.J. Fisher P.B. Insights into glutamate transport regulation in human astrocytes. Cloning of the promoter for excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Aberrant changes in post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphate groups underlie a majority of human diseases. However, detection and quantification of PTMs for diagnostic or biomarker applications often require PTM-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are challenging to generate using traditional antibody-selection methods. Here we outline a general strategy for producing synthetic, PTM-specific mAbs by engineering a motif-specific 'hot spot' into an antibody scaffold. Inspired by a natural phosphate-binding motif, we designed and selected mAb scaffolds with hot spots specific for phosphoserine, phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. Crystal structures of the phospho-specific mAbs revealed two distinct modes of phosphoresidue recognition. Our data suggest that each hot spot functions independently of the surrounding scaffold, as phage display antibody libraries using these scaffolds yielded >50 phospho- and target-specific mAbs against 70% of target peptides. Our motif-specific scaffold strategy may provide a general solution for rapid, robust development of anti-PTM mAbs for signaling, diagnostic and therapeutic applications."

The hemostatic system is also responsible for preventing the dissemination of microbial invaders (7.Levi M. Keller T.T. van Gorp E. ten Cate H. Infection and inflammation and the coagulation system.Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 60: 26-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For example, the intrinsic blood coagulation cascade is activated by negatively charged surfaces, as occurs with many different bacterial species (8.Frick I.M. Björck L. Herwald H. The dual role of the contact system in bacterial infectious disease.Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 98: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The relevance of this innate defense mechanism has been demonstrated for Streptococcus pyogenes, the causative agent of pharyngitis and skin infections (9.Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Dahlbäck B. Björck L.

Furthermore, microbial recognition by pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors triggers the release of cytokines, which activate the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade, thereby depositing fibrin around bacterial invaders (11.Levi M. van der Poll T. ten Cate H. van Deventer S.J. The cytokine-mediated imbalance between coagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms in sepsis and endotoxaemia.Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 27: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Fibrin deposition around microbes generates peptides with antimicrobial activity that attract phagocytes for opsonophagocytic removal of invading pathogens. S. aureus has evolved a unique virulence strategy that usurps the hemostatic system for pathogen survival and replication in infected tissues. Exploiting the presence of coagulation factors in their zymogen form in the bloodstream, all clinical isolates of S. aureus secrete two hemostasis factors, coagulase (Coa) 2The abbreviations used are: CoacoagulaseFXIIIFXIII A and FXIIIB, factor XIII and factor subunits A or BvWFvon Willebrand factorvWbpvon Willebrand factor binding proteinH6His6 tag.

Nevertheless, the C-terminal domains of Coa and vWbp, when purified and used as vaccine antigens, also raised protective antibody responses (20.McAdow M. DeDent A.C. Emolo C. Cheng A.G.

We presume that these antibodies may block the association of Coa and vWbp with other host proteins and disrupt the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infections. Coa and vWbp share significant structural homology in the D1-D2 domains; however, their C-terminal domains are dissimilar (15.Kroh H.K. Panizzi P.

The staphylocoagulase family of zymogen activator and adhesion proteins.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2793-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Coa is comprised of tandem repeats of a 27-residue peptide also found in the N-terminal domain of Efb (22.Palma M. Shannon O. Quezada H.C. Berg A. Flock J.I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31691-31697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of vWbp is found in another uncharacterized gene product of S. aureus. Presumably, this mosaic structure endows coagulases with specific functions. Indeed, vWbp was initially characterized because of its ability to bind von Willebrand factor (vWF) (13.Bjerketorp J.

A novel von Willebrand factor binding protein expressed by Staphylococcus aureus.Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2037-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A 26-amino acid peptide sequence within the C-terminal region of vWbp was identified as the minimal binding region; however, the physiological significance of this interaction has not been established (13.Bjerketorp J.

Here we sought to identify the ligands of Coa and vWbp in human plasma and to analyze the role of these complexes in staphylococcal interferences with host hemostasis. Blood donations were obtained from anonymous healthy adult donors. Written, informed consent was obtained from participants at the time of collection. The procedure was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at The University of Chicago. Human fibrinogen (Sigma), prothrombin (Innovative Research), coagulation factor XIII (FXIII; Hematologic Technologies), and von Willebrand factor (Hematologic Technologies) were used for affinity chromatography studies at 9, 1.4, 0.03, and 0.4 μm, respectively. When needed, lepirudin was used at a final concentration of 10 μg ml−1 and CaCl2 was used at 5 mm. FXIII-deficient plasma was obtained from Affinity Biologicals. Commercial antibodies used in the study included sheep anti-human prothrombin, HRP-conjugated (Affinity Biologicals), mouse anti-human factor XIIIa (FXIIIa; Thermo Scientific), rabbit anti-human FXIIIB (Abcam), rabbit anti-fibronectin (Abcam), goat anti-human vWF, HRP-conjugated (Thermo Scientific), anti-mouse IgG, HRP-conjugated (Cell Signaling), and anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated (Cell Signaling).

One ml of culture was centrifuged at 7000 × g, and bacterial sediment was washed and suspended in 1 ml of sterile PBS to generate a suspension of 1 × 108 cfu ml−1. For binding studies, coding sequence of full-length mature vWbp or its truncations was extended to encode an N-terminal six-histidyl tag (H6) and a C-terminal strep tag (strep) and cloned into pET22b using the primers listed in Table 1. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) were diluted 1:100 into fresh media, grown at 37 °C to A600 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalatopyranoside, and grown for an additional 3 h. Bacterial cells were sedimented by centrifugation, suspended in column buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA)), and disrupted with a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. Lysates were cleared of membrane and insoluble components by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins in the soluble lysate were subjected to Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography. Proteins were eluted in column buffer containing 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin and subsequently dialyzed against PBS. Immediately before use, protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Activity was monitored by the ability to cleave chromogenic thrombin substrate S-2238 (Chromogenix). Coastrep was cloned into pET15b using the primers listed in Table 1 and purified as described above. To assess FXIII activity, the coding sequence of full-length mature vWbpstrep with a C-terminal strep-tag was cloned into pET22b using the primers listed in Table 1 and purified as described above.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotides used in this studyPrimerSequencevWbp_fwd_NcoI_HisGGAATTCCCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATGTGGTTTCTGGGGAGAAGvWbp_rev_XhoI_strepCATGCTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCATTTGCCATTATATACTTTATTGATTTN1_fwd_NcoI_HisGGAATTCCCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATAATGAAGAGGAGCAATTAAAGN2_fwd_NcoI_HisGGAATTCCCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATGCAGCAAAAAGTGATGAATCN3_fwd_NcoI_HisGGAATTCCCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATACATCACCGACTACATATACTN4_fwd_NcoI_HisGGAATTCCCATGGGCAGCAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATATTTATAATGCACCAAAACAATTGC1_rev_XhoI_strepCATGCTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAAATTTGTTGCTGAGTTTGACGC2_rev_XhoI_strepCATGCTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCATGGTTTCTTTGTTGGTGCAC3_rev_XhoI_strepCATGCTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCATTCAGTGTCAGATTTTAATTGAGCCC4_rev_XhoI_strepCATGCTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAAAAGTCTTTCAATTCAGGGTTATCvWbp_fwd_NcoIAAAACCATGGTGGTTTCTGGGGAGAAGAATCoa_fwd_NdeIAAAACATATGATAGTAACAAAGGATTATAGTGGGACoa_rev_XhoI_strepAAAACTCGAGTTATTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCATTTTGTTACTCTAGGCCCATATGT Open table in a new tab Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (IBA) was equilibrated in PBS buffer and charged with 100 nmol of H6vWbpstrep, N1–4, C1–4, or Coastrep. Citrate-plasma from healthy human volunteers (500 μl) was diluted 1:1 in PBS (1.5 mm NaH2PO4, 8.5 mm Na2HPO4, 67 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, containing only traces of calcium (<0.002%), and magnesium (<0.001%) was applied by gravity flow over the resin followed by extensive washing in PBS. Bound proteins were recovered by boiling the resin in sample buffer. Where indicated, human plasma was substituted with 500 μl of purified human plasma proteins in PBS. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed for extracts prepared in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Gels were cast at 12% polyacrylamide, and proteins in extracts were separated by electrophoresis at 25 mA for 50 min. Proteins were either stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) or electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) for immunoblot analysis. Blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). 1.5 μm fibrinogen was incubated with 100 nm thrombin, 200 nm prothrombin, 200 nm vWbpstrep, and/or 20 nm FXIII. Lepirudin or CaCl2 was added to the reaction volume as needed. Insoluble reaction products were isolated by sedimentation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the sediments were washed 3 times in PBS and boiled in sample buffer supplemented with 4 m urea. To assess FXIII activity in human plasma, fresh blood was obtained from consenting volunteers and anticoagulated with 10 mm sodium citrate. Bacterial suspension (50 μl) was added to 50 μl of plasma in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 or 24 h. Insoluble reaction products were isolated as described above. To identify Coomassie-stained proteins in SDS-PAGE gels, bands were excised, placed into microcentrifuge tubes with double distilled H2O, and submitted to the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA, for microcapillary LC/MS/MS mass spectrometry.

Human plasma represents a heterogeneous mixture of >300 distinct proteins with a wide range of concentration (26.Anderson N.L. Anderson N.G. The human plasma proteome. History, character, and diagnostic prospects.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 845-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3559) Google Scholar). Chromatography of human plasma proteins on Strep-Tactin resin charged with H6vWbpstrep identified several proteins as vWbp ligands (Fig. 1A). Binding of these ligands did not occur on Strep-Tactin beads alone (Fig. 1A). Prominent species were subjected to microcapillary LC-MS/MS for identification (Table 2). H6vWbpstrep retained human prothrombin as well as the α-, β- and γ-chains of fibrinogen in addition to fibronectin and factor XIII (Fig. 1A). Of note, vWF was not identified. Fibronectin is a high molecular weight glycoprotein found in blood and in the extracellular matrix (27.Mosher D.F. Furcht L.T. Fibronectin. Review of its structure and possible functions.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1981; 77: 175-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fibronectin interacts with a wide array of macromolecules, most notably with fibrinogen and fibrin, highlighting its importance in blood coagulation and other physiological processes (27.Mosher D.F. Furcht L.T. Fibronectin. Review of its structure and possible functions.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1981; 77: 175-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). FXIII is the zymogen precursor to the active transglutaminase factor XIIIa, also known as fibrin cross-linking factor (28.Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A. Human factor XIII from plasma and platelets. Molecular weights, subunit structures, proteolytic activation, and cross-linking of fibrinogen and fibrin.J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma FXIII is a tetramer of two copies each of the A and B subunits. During the final stages of hemostasis, thrombin activates FXIII by cleaving a 37-residue activation peptide from the N terminus of the A subunit. In the presence of calcium, factor XIIIa catalyzes the formation of ϵ-(γ-glutamyl)-lysine isopeptide bonds in polymerized fibrin strands (28.Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A.

Chem. 1973; 248: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of this reaction, cross-linked fibrin, is endowed with increased stability and resistance to fibrinolysis (29.Ariëns R.A. Lai T.S. Weisel J.W. Greenberg C.S. Grant P.J. Role of factor XIII in fibrin clot formation and effects of genetic polymorphisms.Blood. 2002; 100: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not fibronectin and FXIII are unique ligands of vWbp, we subjected human plasma to affinity chromatography on Strep-Tactin resin that had been charged with either H6vWbpstrep or Coastrep (Fig. 1B). Because its N-terminal formyl-methionine is not removed from the translation product, Coastrep is catalytically inactive (Ref. 21.Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Bock P.E. The staphylocoagulase family of zymogen activator and adhesion proteins.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2793-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and data not shown). In accordance with previous reports (15.Kroh H.K. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. von Willebrand factor-binding protein is a hysteretic conformational activator of prothrombin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21.Panizzi P. Friedrich R. Fuentes-Prior P. Bode W. Bock P.E. The staphylocoagulase family of zymogen activator and adhesion proteins.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2793-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), Coastrep and H6vWbpstrep both retained prothrombin and fibrinogen after affinity chromatography experiments with human plasma (Fig. 1, B and C). Coastrep also retained fibronectin (Fig. 1B). FXIII, on the other hand, was only retained on Strep-Tactin beads charged with H6vWbpstrep but not with Coastrep (Fig. 1C). Thus, FXIII appears to represent a unique ligand of vWbp. A panel of recombinant H6vWbpstrep variants with serial deletions of N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences was generated, and protein products were purified (Fig. 2A). These variants were subjected to affinity chromatography experiments with human plasma and ligand binding monitored via Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (Fig. 2, B and C). Prothrombin and fibrinogen did not bind to vWbp variants with N-terminal truncations (N1-N4), suggesting that the D1 domain of vWbp is necessary for its association with both plasma proteins (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, vWbp variants C1–3, with C-terminal truncations, were able to retain prothrombin and fibrinogen during affinity chromatography; this attribute was abolished after further truncation of the D2 domain (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus, vWbp D1-D2 domains are necessary and sufficient for prothrombin and fibrinogen binding. These data are in accordance with previous studies (15.Kroh H.K. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. von Willebrand factor-binding protein is a hysteretic conformational activator of prothrombin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7786-7791Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

Ft and Ds engage in reciprocal signalling as both proteins can serve as receptor and ligand for each other. The intracellular domains (ICDs) of Ft and Ds regulate the activity of the key SWH pathway transcriptional co-activator protein Yorkie (Yki). Signalling from the FtICD is well characterized and controls tissue growth by regulating the abundance of the Yki-repressive kinase Warts (Wts). Here we identify two regulators of the Drosophila melanogaster SWH pathway that function downstream of the DsICD: the WD40 repeat protein Riquiqui (Riq) and the DYRK-family kinase Minibrain (Mnb). Ds physically interacts with Riq, which binds to both Mnb and Wts. Riq and Mnb promote Yki-dependent tissue growth by stimulating phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of Wts. Thus, we describe a previously unknown branch of the SWH pathway that controls tissue growth downstream of Ds."

However, full JNK3α2 activation requires phosphorylation by both MKK4 and MKK7. Using purified proteins we show that arrestin-3 directly interacts with MKK7 and promotes JNK3α2 phosphorylation by both MKK4 and MKK7 in vitro as well as in intact cells. The binding of JNK3α2 promotes an arrestin-3 interaction with MKK4 while reducing its binding to MKK7. Interestingly, the arrestin-3 concentration optimal for scaffolding the MKK7-JNK3α2 module is ∼10-fold higher than for the MKK4-JNK3α2 module. The data provide a mechanistic basis for arrestin-3-dependent activation of JNK3α2. The opposite effects of JNK3α2 on arrestin-3 interactions with MKK4 and MKK7 is the first demonstration that the kinase components in mammalian MAPK cascades regulate each other's interactions with a scaffold protein. The results show how signaling outcomes can be affected by the relative expression of scaffolding proteins and components of signaling cascades that they assemble. An interaction between arrestin-3 and MKK7 has never been elucidated. Results: Arrestin-3 directly binds MKK7 and promotes JNK3α2 phosphorylation by MKK7 in vitro and in intact cells. Conclusion: Arrestin-3 recruits JNK3α2 and both upstream MKKs. Significance: Arrestin-3 promotes full JNK3α2 activation; MKK binding is regulated by JNK3α2. Arrestin-3 was previously shown to bind JNK3α2, MKK4, and ASK1. However, full JNK3α2 activation requires phosphorylation by both MKK4 and MKK7. Using purified proteins we show that arrestin-3 directly interacts with MKK7 and promotes JNK3α2 phosphorylation by both MKK4 and MKK7 in vitro as well as in intact cells. The binding of JNK3α2 promotes an arrestin-3 interaction with MKK4 while reducing its binding to MKK7.

The results show how signaling outcomes can be affected by the relative expression of scaffolding proteins and components of signaling cascades that they assemble. Arrestins specifically bind active phosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptors, blocking further G protein activation, targeting receptors for internalization, and initiating alternative signaling (for review, see Refs. 1.Gurevich V.V.

MAP kinases form highly conserved signaling cascades stimulated by a wide variety of extracellular signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and environmental stress (5.Pearson G. Robinson F.

Canonical MAP kinase cascades consist of three kinases that successively phosphorylate and activate the downstream components (5.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K.

The JNK signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of many cellular events, including growth control, transformation, and apoptosis (13.Davis R.J. Signal transduction by the JNK group of MAP kinases.Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). The JNK family consists of several ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms and neuron-specific JNK3, which is also expressed in the heart and testes (14.Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Selective interaction of JNK protein kinase isoforms with transcription factors.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Differential splicing and exon usage yield 10 different JNK isoforms (15.Waetzig V. Herdegen T. Context-specific inhibition of JNKs. Overcoming the dilemma of protection and damage.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 455-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). JNKs are activated by concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue within a conserved Thr-Pro-Tyr (TPY) motif in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Interestingly, two upstream MAP kinase kinases, MKK4 and MKK7, preferentially phosphorylate distinct JNK activation sites: MKK4 phosphorylates tyrosine, whereas MKK7 phosphorylates threonine. The monophosphorylation of JNKs on either residue is reportedly sufficient to partially activate the kinase and induce phosphorylation of downstream substrates; however, full activation of JNKs requires both MKK4 and MKK7 (14.Gupta S.

Here, we provide the first evidence that arrestin-3 scaffolds the MKK7-JNK3α2 signaling complex. We found that the phosphorylation of the threonine residue within the TPY motif was promoted by arrestin-3 in COS-7 cells. We showed that arrestin-3 directly binds to MKK7, comparably to MKK4. Moreover, we found that JNK3α2 enhanced the association between arrestin-3 with MKK4 while reducing arrestin-3 binding to MKK7. We also compared the binding of arrestin-3 to active and inactive MKK4 and MKK7. In both cases active MKKs bind arrestin-3 as well as inactive ones, and JNK3α2 differentially regulates the binding of the two upstream MKKs to arrestin-3. This differential regulation of the binding of upstream kinases by JNK3α2 may underlie the higher optimal arrestin-3 concentration for JNK3α2 phosphorylation by MKK7 than by MKK4. We found that the two MKKs compete for arrestin-3 binding. Finally, we found that arrestin-3 facilitates JNK3α2 activation by either MKK in intact cells. These findings represent the first evidence that arrestin-3 is not only capable of scaffolding MKK4-JNK3α2 but also the MKK7-JNK3α2 signaling complex. This is also the first demonstration that the kinase components in mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades regulate each other's interactions with scaffold proteins. [γ-32P]ATP was from Perkin-Elmer (Waltham, MA). All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Cell culture reagents and media were from Mediatech (Manassas, VA) or Invitrogen.

GST-MKK4 was bound to glutathione-Sepharose high performance beads, which were re-suspended in 10 ml of a suspension buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol, pH 7.3). 20 units of thrombin (Novagen) were added to the suspension and incubated at room temperature overnight. The column was washed with ∼3 column volumes of the same buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Tag-less MKK4 fractions were pooled and further purified by a Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column that was pre-equilibrated with Mono Q buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.03% Brij-30 (v/v), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v)). The column was eluted with 15–17 column volumes of Mono Q buffer with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. Fractions of pure tag-less MKK4 were collected, dialyzed, and stored in buffer S (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT) containing 20% glycerol at −80 °C until further use.

Cells from a single colony were used to inoculate 40 ml of Terrific Broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 100-fold into the same media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. The cells were then induced with 25 μm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside and cultured for an additional 20 h at 25 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. The cells were then harvested, immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cells were then lysed in 200 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.03% Brij-30, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 0.1 mm tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20% glycerol. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, then Triton-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v), and the incubation at 4 °C was extended for another 30 min. The cell lysate was sonicated (at 5 s pulses with 5-s intervals) at 4 °C for 5 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was then agitated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with 200 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and 20% glycerol, the GST-MKK7-His6 protein was eluted with 40 ml buffer A, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm imidazole and 20% glycerol. The eluted protein was collected and dialyzed into buffer S (25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT) containing 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford reagent. To make MBP-arrestin-3, arrestin-3 cDNA was subcloned into pMal-p2T (25.Matsuda N. Kitami T. Suzuki T. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. Tanaka K.

Escherichia coli strain BL21-codon plus (DE3)-RIL was used for expression. The cells were grown in LB at 30 °C overnight to A600 = 1.5–2.0 and then induced with 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside at 30 °C for 5–6 h. The cells from 1 liter were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer A), and lysed by freezing and thawing in the presence of lysozyme (3 mg/liter) followed by sonication (3 × 15 s; 80% amplitude; Sonic Dismembrator Model 500, Fisher). After centrifugation (9000 rpm for 90 min, Sorvall SLA-3000 rotor), the supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of amylose beads (50% slurry, New England Biolabs) at 4 °C for 2 h. Supernatant was removed by centrifugation (3000 rpm for 10 min), and the beads were washed by 20 ml of buffer A 3 times. 5 ml of elution buffer containing 50 mm maltose was added to elute the MBP-arrestin-3 proteins. The eluate was dialyzed 3 times against buffer A to remove maltose (>3 h each time). The protein samples were collected, concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. MBP was expressed in empty pMal-p2T vector and purified using the same procedure. GST-MKK4 (full-length wild-type human mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MAP2K4) (GenBankTM accession number NM_003010) with an N-terminal cleavable GST tag) was expressed, purified, and activated essentially as described previously (21.Breitman M.

The activated GST-MKK7-His6 was stored in buffer S containing 20% glycerol at −80 °C until further use. Binding of MKK4 and MKK7 to arrestin-3 was assayed by MBP pulldown with MBP-arrestin-3 immobilized on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 25 μl of purified MBP-arrestin-3 (5 μg) were incubated with 25 μl of amylose resin (50% slurry) in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl) at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 2 h. Subsequently, 100 μl of protein solutions containing active (phosphorylated by GST-MEKK1c) or inactive MKK4 or MKK7 (5 μg) along with different amounts of JNK3α2 (0, 2, 5, 10 μg) were added, and the suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The suspension was transferred to centrifuge filters (Ultrafree, Millipore) and washed three times with binding buffer. The proteins were eluted from resin by the addition of 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm maltose, 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.3, and 150 mm NaCl). Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Samples obtained with MBP bound to the resin served as controls for nonspecific binding. To evaluate the effects of MKK7 on the arrestin3-MKK4 binding, the interaction between arrestin-3 and MKK4 was assayed using immobilized MBP-arrestin-3 (5 μg) to pull down tag-less MKK4 (5 μg) in the presence of various amounts of GST-MKK7 (0, 5, 10 μg). Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To test how many MKK molecules can bind arrestin-3 simultaneously, we performed GST pulldown using GST-MKK7 to pull down tag-less MKK4 in the presence of different amounts of arrestin-3. Briefly, 25 μl of GST-MKK7 (3 μg) was incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (50% slurry, Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 50 μl of protein solutions containing MKK4 (3 μg) and different amounts of arrestin-3 (0, 5, 10 μg) were added, and the suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The suspension was transferred to centrifuge filters (Ultrafree, Millipore) and washed 3 times with binding buffer. The proteins were eluted from resin by the addition of 100 μl of elution buffer (50 mm reduced glutathione, 4 mm DTT, 50 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl). Eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. African green monkey cells (COS-7) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) plus penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were plated at 80–90% confluence and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-starved overnight before all experiments and used 48 h post-transfection. Cells (60-mm plates) were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10 min at 9000 rpm, 4 °C), supernatants containing around 500 μg of total protein were precleared by incubation with 35 μl of protein G-agarose (50% slurry, Millipore). Supernatant was incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h or overnight followed by the addition of 35 μl of protein G-agarose beads (50% slurry, Millipore) for 2 h. The beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 50 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by Western blot. The effect of arrestins on the phosphorylation of JNK3α2 by MKK7 or MKK4 was analyzed by an in vitro kinase activity assay, as previously described (22.Zhan X. Gimenez L.E. Gurevich V.V. Spiller B.W. Crystal structure of arrestin-3 reveals the basis of the difference in receptor binding between two non-visual subtypes.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 406: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assays were conducted in 10 μl containing the following final concentrations: 50 nm active MKK7 or MKK4, 0.5 μm JNK3α2, and 0–30 μm arrestin-3. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.2 mm ATP (4 μCi of γ-32P), and the mixtures were incubated individually at 30 °C for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 15 μl of Laemmli SDS sample buffer (Sigma) and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. Phosphorylated JNK3α2 was visualized by autoradiography. The bands were cut out, and the radioactivity was measured in a Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A simple interaction model that only requires concentrations of components and equilibrium affinity constants as an input (KinTek Explorer Professional Version 3.0.2394) from KinTek Corp. was used. Based on these values, the model calculates the concentrations of all possible complexes. Activation of JNK relies on two upstream MAP kinase kinases, MKK4 and MKK7, each of which preferentially phosphorylates a distinct site, tyrosine (MKK4) and threonine (MKK7) (Fig. 1B) (16.Lawler S.

How JNK makes the appropriate choice of its upstream kinases is a challenging question, as the activation of JNK depends on a wide variety of factors, including the nature of a stimulus and relevant physiological and pathological processes as well as differential tissue distribution of MKKs and scaffolding proteins. Previous studies showed that scaffold proteins play a significant role in determining the differential requirements of upstream kinases for JNK activation (27.Zou H. Li Q. Lin S.C. Wu Z. Han J. Ye Z.

Thus, the mechanisms producing N-degrons in proteins and the frequency of their occurrence largely remain a mystery. To address these issues, we used a ClpS affinity column to isolate interacting proteins from E. coli cell lysates under non-denaturing conditions. We identified more than 100 proteins that differentially bound to a column charged with wild-type ClpS and eluted with a peptide bearing an N-degron.

https://openalex.org/W2076778825,"Cytoplasmic dynein is well characterized as an organelle motor, but dynein also acts to tether and stabilize dynamic microtubule plus-ends in vitro. Here we identify a novel and direct interaction between dynein and the 180-kDa isoform of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Optical trapping experiments indicate that dynein bound to beads via the NCAM180 interaction domain can tether projecting microtubule plus-ends. Live cell assays indicate that the NCAM180-dependent recruitment of dynein to the cortex leads to the selective stabilization of microtubules projecting to NCAM180 patches at the cell periphery. The dynein-NCAM180 interaction also enhances cell-cell adhesion in heterologous cell assays. Dynein and NCAM180 co-precipitate from mouse brain extract and from synaptosomal fractions, consistent with an endogenous interaction in neurons. Thus, we examined microtubule dynamics and synaptic density in primary cortical neurons. We find that depletion of NCAM, inhibition of the dynein-NCAM180 interaction, or dampening of microtubule dynamics with low dose nocodazole all result in significantly decreased in synaptic density. Based on these observations, we propose a working model for the role of dynein at the synapse, in which the anchoring of the motor to the cortex via binding to an adhesion molecule mediates the tethering of dynamic microtubule plus-ends to potentiate synaptic stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2019654017,"Vertebrate genomes code for three subtypes of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3R1, -2, and -3). Individual IP3R monomers are assembled to form homo- and heterotetrameric channels that mediate Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. IP3R subtypes are regulated differentially by IP3, Ca(2+), ATP, and various other cellular factors and events. IP3R subtypes are seldom expressed in isolation in individual cell types, and cells often express different complements of IP3R subtypes. When multiple subtypes of IP3R are co-expressed, the subunit composition of channels cannot be specifically defined. Thus, how the subunit composition of heterotetrameric IP3R channels contributes to shaping the spatio-temporal properties of IP3-mediated Ca(2+) signals has been difficult to evaluate. To address this question, we created concatenated IP3R linked by short flexible linkers. Dimeric constructs were expressed in DT40-3KO cells, an IP3R null cell line. The dimeric proteins were localized to membranes, ran as intact dimeric proteins on SDS-PAGE, and migrated as an ∼1100-kDa band on blue native gels exactly as wild type IP3R. Importantly, IP3R channels formed from concatenated dimers were fully functional as indicated by agonist-induced Ca(2+) release. Using single channel ""on-nucleus"" patch clamp, the channels assembled from homodimers were essentially indistinguishable from those formed by the wild type receptor. However, the activity of channels formed from concatenated IP3R1 and IP3R2 heterodimers was dominated by IP3R2 in terms of the characteristics of regulation by ATP. These studies provide the first insight into the regulation of heterotetrameric IP3R of defined composition. Importantly, the results indicate that the properties of these channels are not simply a blend of those of the constituent IP3R monomers."

Here we show that the mouse DZIP1 regulates Hedgehog signaling through two mechanisms. First, DZIP1 interacts with GLI3, a transcriptional regulator for Hedgehog signaling, and prevents GLI3 from entering the nucleus. Second, DZIP1 is required for ciliogenesis. We show that DZIP1 colocalizes and interacts with CEP164, a protein localizing at appendages of the mother centrioles, and IFT88, a component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Functionally, both CEP164 and Ninein appendage proteins fail to localize to ciliary appendages in Dzip1 mutant cells; IFT components are not recruited to the basal body of cilia. Importantly, the accumulation of GLI3 in the nucleus is independent of loss of primary cilia in Dzip1 mutant cells. Therefore, DZIP1 is the first known ciliogenic protein that regulates Hedgehog signaling through a dual mechanism and that biochemically links IFT machinery with Hedgehog pathway components."

https://openalex.org/W1990044641,"Our previous studies on a β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, GnT-IX (GnT-Vb), a homolog of GnT-V, indicated that the enzyme has a broad GlcNAc transfer activity toward N-linked and O-mannosyl glycan core structures and that its brain-specific gene expression is regulated by epigenetic histone modifications. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of an endogenous inhibitory factor for GnT-IX that functions as a key regulator for GnT-IX enzymatic activity in Neuro2a (N2a) cells. We purified this factor from N2a cells and found that it is identical to ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 3 (ENPP3), as evidenced by mass spectrometry and by the knockdown and overexpression of ENPP3 in cultured cells. Kinetic analyses revealed that the mechanism responsible for the inhibition of GnT-IX caused by ENPP3 is the ENPP3-mediated hydrolysis of the nucleotide sugar donor substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, with the resulting generation of UMP, a potent and competitive inhibitor of GnT-IX. Indeed, ENPP3 knockdown cells had significantly increased levels of intracellular nucleotide sugars and displayed changes in the total cellular glycosylation profile. In addition to chaperones or other known regulators of glycosyltransferases, the ENPP3-mediated hydrolysis of nucleotide sugars would have widespread and significant impacts on glycosyltransferase activities and would be responsible for altering the total cellular glycosylation profile and modulating cellular functions."

However, an abnormally elevated miR-29a level is associated with several diseases. For example, miR-29a is increased in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver of diabetic rats, and the up-regulation of miR-29a causes insulin resistance in adipocytes (12.Hulsmans M. De Keyzer D.

In addition, miR-29a expression is greatly enhanced in patients with invasive breast carcinomas compared with non-invasive hyperplasias (14.Gebeshuber C.A. Zatloukal K.

All these data indicate that abnormal up-regulation of miR-29a is harmful; thus, miR-29a expression should be properly suppressed. Indeed, previous studies reveal that miR-29a is suppressed by multiple factors, such as TGF-β/Smad3, c-Myc, Hedgehog, and NF-κB signaling pathways (15.Mott J.L. Kurita S. Cazanave S.C. Bronk S.F.

In the male reproductive system, especially in epididymis, the androgen pathway plays very important regulatory roles in development, function, gene expression, and even miRNA expression. For example, miR-125b, miR-99a, and miR-100 are suppressed by androgen/AR in LNCaP prostate cancer cells (19.Sun D. Lee Y.S. Malhotra A. Kim H.K. Matecic M. Evans C. Jensen R.V. Moskaluk C.A.

All the evidence suggests that miR-29b1 and miR-29a may be involved in the androgen signaling pathway in the male reproductive system. Epididymis, a highly androgen-sensitive organ responsible for sperm maturation and storage, was used here to test this possibility by using a castration model. Our results showed that miR-29a was repressed by androgen/AR in mouse epididymis. Disruption of the repression by overexpressing miR-29a in transgenic mice resulted in epididymis hypoplasia. Furthermore, elevated miR-29a expression can reversibly suppress AR expression by targeting IGF1 and CDC42/p85α-p53 pathways. Taken together, our results demonstrated a regulatory circuitry between androgen/AR signaling pathway and miR-29a that may be important for epididymal development and functions. Male C57BL/6 mice and male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from the Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Experiments were conducted according to a protocol approved by the Institute Animal Care Committee. The protocol conforms to internationally accepted guidelines for the humane care and use of laboratory animals. The approved permit number for this study is SYXK2007-0017. Immortalized mouse epididymal cell line PC-1 from proximal caput epididymis was kindly provided by Dr. Orgebin-Crist (Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). PC-1 cells were grown at 33 °C with 5% CO2 in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 4 mm glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin (25,000 units of penicillin G sodium, 25 mg of streptomycin sulfate), and 1 nm 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (20.Araki Y.

The MCF-7 and HEK 293T cells were maintained in DMEM; LNCaP, RM-1, U-2 OS, and T24 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS; MG-63 cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS; and RWPE-1 cells were maintained in keratinocyte serum-free medium. All of these cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. For androgen deprivation, cells were plated in medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped serum (Hyclone) 24 h before treatment with DHT. Ethanol was used as a vehicle. The IGF1 protein was purchased from ProSpec Co. (catalog number CYT-216). Castration and androgen replacement were conducted following a protocol described previously (21.Hu S. Yao G. Guan X. Ni Z. Ma W. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Liu Q. Zhang Y. Research resource: genome-wide mapping of in vivo androgen receptor binding sites in mouse epididymis.Mol.

RNase9, an androgen-dependent member of the RNase A family, is specifically expressed in the rat epididymis.Biol. Reprod. 2007; 76: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the mouse castration model, adult 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were castrated bilaterally under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. The mice were divided into three groups (six mice per group), killed at different times after castration (0 and 2 days after the initial testosterone propionate (TP, 2.5 mg/kg of body weight) or sesame oil injections (7 days after castration)). For the rat castration model, 120-day-old normal male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into nine groups (four to seven rats per group) and killed on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after castration as well as 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after the initial TP injection. Androgen supplementation began on the 7th day after castration, and the rats were injected with TP (3 mg/kg of body weight) every 2 days. The epididymidis, prostate, and brain were excised and used for RNA extraction. The RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was resolved by a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The RNA was then transferred to GeneScreen Plus Hybridization Transfer Membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After baking at 80 °C for 0.5 h and then UV cross-linking, the membranes were stained by methylene blue to evaluate the transfer efficiency. The membranes were incubated in hybridization buffer (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) at 45 °C for 30 min and then hybridized with specific γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes (Sangon, Shanghai, China) complementary to each miRNA at 45 °C for 16 h. The membranes were washed twice with washing buffer (2× SSC with 0.1% SDS), and the signal was detected by a phosphorimaging scanner (Fujifilm 9000). The hybridized membranes were then rehybridized with specific γ-32P-labeled 5 S rRNA probes (Sangon), which were used as a loading control, at 50 °C for 2 h. The oligonucleotide probes for Northern blotting were as follows: miR-29a, 5′-TAACCGATTTCAGATGGTGCTA-3′; miR-29b, 5′-AACACTGATTTCAAATGGTGCTA-3′; 5 S rRNA, 5′-CGGTATTCCCAGGCGGTCT-3′. The ChIP, ChIP-PCR, ChIP-quantitative PCR, peak finding, motif search, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were conducted following a protocol described previously (21.Hu S. Yao G. Guan X. Ni Z. Ma W. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Liu Q. Zhang Y. Research resource: genome-wide mapping of in vivo androgen receptor binding sites in mouse epididymis.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 2392-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The primers for ChIP-PCR and ChIP-quantitative PCR were: forward, 5′-TTGGTTCTCATCCGTCCTTTAT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGAATGGCTCATTCCCTCATAGA-3′. A precursor of mouse miR-29b1a was amplified with the following primers: forward, 5′-GTgcggccgcACGGACTTCACCTTCCCT-3′ (NotI); reverse, 5′-GAgagctcGTCAGCAATAACGTAGTCAG-3′ (SacI). The lowercase underlined nucleotides represent nucleotide sequences of the recognition site for the restriction enzymes. The 541-bp product was digested with restriction endonucleases NotI and SacI and then cloned into the expression vector pUBC containing a human ubiquitin C promoter, which was found to provide the most reliable expression across different cell types. After testing the efficacy of miR-29a and miR-29b overexpression in HEK 293T cells, the construct was linearized for pronuclear microinjection. Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed to detect mRNA expression using Toyobo SYBR Green Real-time PCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Levels of mRNAs were normalized to Gapdh. The primers were as follows: mouse Ar, 5′-CTGGGAAGGGTCTACCCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGCTATGTTAGCGGCCTC-3′ (reverse); mouse Adam7, 5′-GGTCATTGTGCTTGTCATGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACGGAGGATTAGCCCAGTCT-3′ (reverse); mouse Fkbp5, 5′-GTCCAAAGCCTCAGAGTCGTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCCTTTCTCATTGGCACTGTC-3′ (reverse); mouse Gldc, 5′-AAAAGTCCGCACAGTGAAAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCCCAGGGCAAATGTTTA-3′ (reverse); mouse Gpx5, 5′-TATTGCGGTCTGACAATCCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTAAGGGGGAAGGAGGAAGA-3′ (reverse); mouse Igf1, 5′-CTGGACCAGAGACCCTTTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGACGGGGACTTCTGAGTCTT-3′ (reverse); mouse Cdc42, 5′-AAAAGTGGGTGCCTGAGATAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCTCTTCTTCGGTTCTGGAG-3′ (reverse); mouse p85α, 5′-GCAGAGGGCTACCAGTACAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTGAATCCAAGTGCCACTAAGG-3′ (reverse). RNA oligonucleotides were transfected into cells using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. miR-29a and miR-29b duplex (pre-miR-29a and pre-miR-29b) or miR-29a-specific inhibitor (anti-miR-29a) molecules and appropriate negative control molecules (pre-miR-negative control (pre-miR-NC) or anti-miR-negative control (anti-miR-NC)) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The following small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China): Igf1 siRNA-1, 5′-CAGCCUUCCAACUCAAUUATT-3′; Igf1 siRNA-2, 5′-GUGACUUCUUGAAGAUAAATT-3′; p53 siRNA, 5′-GUACAUGUGUAAUAGCUCCTT-3′. Proteins were extracted from cells using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Each protein sample (30–50 μg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for AR and p53) or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (for IGF1) and then semidry blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection of proteins was carried out by standard procedures using rabbit polyclonal antibody to AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:500 dilution), IGF1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 1:500 dilution), and p53 (Abcam; 1:500 dilution). The protein blots were probed with primary antibody and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma-Aldrich) and detected using ECL (GE Healthcare) reagents. β-Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a loading control. The 792-bp AR-binding region around the peak summit was amplified with primer 1 (5′-gaggtaccTCCCATGTCTTTGACTTGATTTTC-3′ (KpnI)) and primer 2 (5′-gaactcgagGCTCGCCCTTTGAGAAACATT-3′ (XhoI)) and subcloned into pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Promoter luciferase reporter vectors. The lowercase underlined nucleotides represent nucleotide sequences of the recognition site for the restriction enzymes. The ARE was mutated with primer 1, primer 2, primer 3 (5′-TTCAGGGCCTGAGTAGATAGATGT-3′), primer 4 (5′-TAAGAACATGGCTCAATTCTTTTTC-3′), and primer 5 (5′-TACTCAGGCCCTGAAtTAaAGCATaTTtTAAGAACATGGCTCA-3′). The lowercase, bold, underlined nucleotides represent mutated nucleotides. Briefly, the upstream ARBS fragment was amplified using primer 1 and primer 3, the downstream ARBS fragment was amplified using primer 2 and primer 4, and then the full-length mutated ARBS was amplified using primer 1, primer 2, and primer 5 with the upstream and downstream fragments as templates. Then the product was cut with KpnI and XhoI and ligated with pGL3-Promoter luciferase reporter vectors. HEK 293T cells were grown in 96-well plates, cotransfected with 150 ng of reporter constructs, 15 ng of pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase), and 15 ng of pcDNA3.1-Ar expression vector coding for full-length human AR using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 12 h of transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm dihydrotestosterone or ethanol vehicle for 24 h. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Mithras LB940 multimode microplate reader (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of human IGF1 mRNA were amplified using the primers 5′-CCGctcgagTCCATCTGTGGCATTTGTACC-3′ (XhoI) and 5′-GTAgcggccgcCCCTTGTGTCATCTTTGGCTCC-3′ (NotI). The lowercase underlined nucleotides represent nucleotide sequences of the recognition site for the restriction enzymes. After cutting with XhoI and NotI, the amplified products were subcloned downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene of the psiCHECKTM-2 plasmid (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). The primers for mutation of the target site of human IGF1 3′-UTR were 5′-GTAAAACTCTGTTTTTTAGTATAATGGGTAGATTTTGTAGTTTGTTATATGAAAGAGTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACTCTTTCATATAACAAACTACAAAATCTACCCATTATACTAAAAAACAGAGTTTTAC-3′ (reverse). The four nucleotides TGCT in “seed” sequences of the miR-29a potential target site were mutated to GTAG (underlined). HEK 293T cells were seeded to 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with 100 ng of psiCHECK-2 (Promega) vector containing the wild-type IGF1 3′-UTR (named IGF1-3′-UTR-WT) or IGF1 3′-UTR mutant (named as IGF1-3′-UTR-Mut) together with 30 nm pre-miR-29a or pre-miR-NC, respectively. Using the Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega), the luciferase activities were measured 24 h after transfection. The Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to firefly activity. Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was used for cotransfection of RNA oligonucleotides and plasmid. H&E staining of the sections was carried out using standard protocols. Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously (22.Zhu C.F. Liu Q. Zhang L. Yuan H.X. Zhen W. Zhang J.S. Chen Z.J. Hall S.H. French F.S. Zhang Y.L. RNase9, an androgen-dependent member of the RNase A family, is specifically expressed in the rat epididymis.Biol. Reprod. 2007; 76: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. The 1:100-diluted anti-AR antiserum (Abcam, catalog number ab74272) was applied to the tissues overnight at 4 °C, and the 1:200-diluted biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Expression was visualized using HRP substrate. As a negative control, serial sections were subjected to the same procedure with normal rabbit serum replacing the primary antibody. The expression was visualized using HRP substrate. The sections were mounted in 80% glycerol and examined with an Olympus BX-52 microscope. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (24.Gupta A. Mo Y.Y. Detection of microRNAs in cultured cells and paraffin-embedded tissue specimens by in situ hybridization.Methods Mol. Biol. 2011; 676: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the epididymal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. The embedded epididymidis was sectioned. The slides were dewaxed, then digested with proteinase K (500 ng/ml), hybridized with locked nucleic acid probes (Exiqon) specific for mmu-miR-29a, U6 snRNA, and scrambled oligonucleotides, which were labeled with digoxigenin. The temperature of hybridization was 65 °C. The expression of miR-29a or control small RNAs was visualized using alkaline phosphatase substrate. The TUNEL assay was performed according to the protocol of the in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). In short, after deparaffinization and rehydration, the 5-μm paraplast tissue sections were incubated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K solution (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, catalog number 25530049) for 15 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, sections were incubated with FITC-labeled terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Then sections were rinsed in PBS and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Androgen acts through its receptor, AR, to control normal development of male reproductive organs and maintain male characteristics. Orchiectomy is considered as an ideal model to investigate androgen effects, for example, its regulation of gene expression. Therefore, herein a castration model was used to investigate the response of miR-29a to androgen manipulation. First, we found that the level of miR-29a was higher in the mouse epididymis at 9 days after orchiectomy (7 days after castration with sesame oil injection for 2 days) than in normal epididymis. The miR-29a level in the sesame oil injection group was also higher than in the TP injection group (Fig. 1A, left panel). These results strongly demonstrated that the miR-29a level was reversely related with the androgen level (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, similar phenomena were observed in rat epididymis by using a castration model (Fig. 1B). After castration, the ratio of epididymal cell types may be altered due to cell apoptosis occurring mainly in principle cells (25.Fan X. Robaire B. Orchidectomy induces a wave of apoptotic cell death in the epididymis.Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2128-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the altered ratios of cell types in the castrated epididymis caused the change of miR-29a, we investigated the miR-29a expression pattern in normal rat epididymis using in situ hybridization. The result showed that miR-29a was extensively expressed in epididymal epithelial cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, the change of miR-29a mainly caused the regulatory effects. Furthermore, we tested whether miR-29a was androgen-responsive in principal cells using an in vitro system. The PC-1 cell line, an immortalized epididymal principal cell line from mouse proximal caput, was used here. PC-1 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with different concentrations of DHT. Twenty-four hours later, miR-29a expression was determined using Northern blotting. The expression of miR-29a in PC-1 cells cultured without DHT was higher than that with DHT. Furthermore, the level of miR-29a displayed a dosage-dependent pattern (Fig. 1D), also further validating that the up-regulation of miR-29a in castrated epididymis was not the consequence of the alteration of cell type ratios but the alteration of the androgen level. Thus, miR-29a was an androgen-repressive miRNA in mouse and rat epididymis. miR-29b1, another member of the miR-29 family, is in close proximity to miR-29a on mouse chromosome 6 (26.Wang H. Garzon R. Sun H. Ladner K.J. Singh R. Dahlman J. Cheng A. Hall B.M. Qualman S.J. Chandler D.S. Croce C.M. Guttridge D.C. NF-κB-YY1-miR-29 regulatory circuitry in skeletal myogenesis and rhabdomyosarcoma.Cancer Cell. 2008; 14: 369-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Therefore, we detected the response of miR-29b to androgen. Similarly, miR-29b was also suppressed by androgen (Fig. 1E). In conclusion, the miR-29b1/a cluster was repressed by the androgen signaling system. In contrast, Ribas et al. (27.Ribas J. Ni X. Haffner M. Wentzel E.A. Salmasi A.H. Chowdhury W.H. Kudrolli T.A. Yegnasubramanian S. Luo J. Rodriguez R. Mendell J.T. Lupold S.E. miR-21: an androgen receptor-regulated microRNA that promotes hormone-dependent and hormone-independent prostate cancer growth.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 7165-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) found by miRNA microarray analysis that miR-29a may be one AR-induced miRNA in two human androgen-responsive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and LAPC-4. To validate this result, LNCaP cells were plated in medium with 0–10 nm DHT, and 72 h later, the cells were harvested to detect the miR-29a level. The result showed that miR-29a was indeed induced by androgen in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A), which differed from epididymal cells. Hereupon, we asked the question whether miR-29a was suppressed by androgen specifically in epididymis. To answer this question, we further investigated miR-29a expression in prostate and brain in castrated mouse. We found that the expression of miR-29a was repressed by androgen stimulation in mouse prostate tissue, whereas in brain, there was no apparent change (Fig. 2, B and C). Therefore, the repression of miR-29a by androgen was not epididymis-specific. Next, we asked whether the response patterns of miR-29a were different between physiological and tumorigenic states. We then investigated the responses of miR-29a to androgen stimulation in mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1 and normal human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. We found that miR-29a was also suppressed by androgen in RM-1 cells and RWPE-1, although the change in RWPE-1 cells was weak (Fig. 2, D and E). Furthermore, we also tested the responses of miR-29a to androgen in several human AR-positive cancer cell lines, including MCF-7 (breast cancer), U-2 OS, and MG-63 (osteosarcoma), and T24 (bladder carcinoma). However, there were no apparent changes in these cell l"

Some recombinant heterodimers composed of a COX-deficient mutant subunit and a native subunit (i.e. Mutant/Native PGHS-2) have COX activities similar to native PGHS-2. This suggests that the presence of heme plus substrate leads to the subunits becoming lodged in a semi-stable Eallo-mutant/Ecat-Native∼heme form during catalysis. We examined this concept using human PGHS-2 dimers composed of combinations of Y385F, R120Q, R120A, and S530A mutant or native subunits. With some heterodimers (e.g. Y385F/Native PGHS-2), heme binds with significantly higher affinity to the native subunit. This correlates with near native COX activity for the heterodimer. With other heterodimers (e.g. S530A/Native PGHS-2), heme binds with similar affinities to both subunits, and the COX activity approximates that expected for an enzyme in which each monomer contributes equally to the net COX activity. With or without heme, aspirin acetylates one-half of the subunits of the native PGHS-2 dimer, the Ecat subunits. Subunits having an S530A mutation are refractory to acetylation. Curiously, aspirin acetylates only one-quarter of the monomers of S530A/Native PGHS-2 with or without heme. This implies that there are comparable amounts of two noninterchangeable species of apoenzymes, Eallo-S530A/Ecat-Native and Eallo-Native/Ecat-S530A. These results suggest that native PGHS-2 assumes a reasonably stable, asymmetric Eallo/Ecat form during its folding and processing.

All striated muscle isoforms, including α-Tm, are phosphorylated at a single site, serine 283, by several potential kinases (2.Mak A. Smillie L.B. Bárány M.

Recent studies indicate that mice expressing transgenic (TG) α-Tm with Ser-283 mutated to alanine (S283A) show no major alterations in cardiac function at basal levels with striking increases in the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and an increase in phospholamban (PLN) Ser-16 phosphorylation (8.Schulz E.M.

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) is considered a disease of contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, z-disc proteins, and Ca2+-handling proteins (19.Force T. Bonow R.O. Houser S.R.

Research priorities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: report of a Working Group of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.Circulation. 2010; 122: 1130-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). α-Tm has been found to encode 11 mutations that lead to FHC (20.Wieczorek D.F. Jagatheesan G. Rajan S. The role of tropomyosin in heart disease.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 644: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratories established a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant FHC α-Tm E180G protein. This mouse model develops severe concentric cardiac hypertrophy with significant ventricular fibrosis and atrial enlargement. Significant physiological alterations in cardiac function, including diastolic dysfunction, occur in addition to myofilaments that demonstrate an increased activation of the thin filament through enhanced calcium sensitivity of steady-state force (21.Prabhakar R. Petrashevskaya N. Schwartz A. Aronow B. Boivin G.P. Molkentin J.D. Wieczorek D.F. A mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by a α-tropomyosin mutation.Mol. Cell.

Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1815-1828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that Tm phosphorylation levels change from 1.5 to 15 months of age; however, by 4–5 months, the levels of Tm phosphorylation are higher in α-Tm E180G transgenic hearts than in their controls (8.Schulz E.M. Correll R.N. Sheikh H.N. Lofrano-Alves M.S. Engel P.L. Newman G. Schultz Jel J. Molkentin J.D. Wolska B.M. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Tropomyosin dephosphorylation results in compensated cardiac hypertrophy.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 44478-44489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these results of increased Tm phosphorylation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mice were confirmed with another FHC mouse model, namely the α-Tm D175N mice (23.Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I.L. Boivin G.P. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J. Wieczorek D.F. Mouse model of a familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation in α-tropomyosin manifests cardiac dysfunction.Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a dilated cardiomyopathy mouse model (α-Tm E54K) shows a 40% decrease in Tm phosphorylation in the heart; myofilaments from these mice exhibit a decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity (9.Warren C.M. Arteaga G.M. Rajan S. Ahmed R.P. Wieczorek D.F. Solaro R.J. Use of 2-D DIGE analysis reveals altered phosphorylation in a tropomyosin mutant (Glu54Lys) linked to dilated cardiomyopathy.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Unknown issues concerning the FHC Tm mice are whether the increased Tm phosphorylation levels are a contributing cause or consequence of the disease phenotype. To address this question, we hypothesized that decreasing Tm phosphorylation through a Tm S283A mutation may attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and improve cardiac function in mice expressing the α-Tm E180G mutation alone. To that end, we generated double mutant transgenic (DMTG) mice expressing Tm encoding both the α-Tm E180G and S283A mutations on the same molecule; several TG mouse lines were generated and analyzed. DMTG animals had no change in heart:body weight ratios and no deposition of fibrotic material characteristic of the α-Tm E180G hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenotype. Also, echocardiographic studies indicated rescued cardiac function with improved performance in the DMTG animals compared with non-transgenic (NTG) mice. Also, the DMTG myofilaments exhibited intermediate levels of Ca2+ sensitivity between those found in NTG and α-Tm E180G hearts. Interestingly, the DMTG hearts did not show the dramatic increase in SERCA2a expression seen in the α-Tm S283A hearts but did exhibit increased phosphorylation of PLN at both Ser-16 and Thr-17 when compared with the α-Tm E180G levels. This is the first study demonstrating that decreasing phosphorylation of α-Tm can rescue a hypertrophic cardiac disease phenotype. Mouse striated muscle α-Tm cDNA was subjected to QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies) utilizing the primer 5′-CAC GCT CTC AAC GAT ATG ACT GCC ATA TAA GTT TCT TTG CTT CAC-3′ mutating the penultimate serine to an alanine and the primer 5′-ACG TGC AGA GGG GCG GGC TGA-3′ mutating glutamic acid 180 to a glycine. The mutation was verified through sequencing of the construct by Genewiz. The α-Tm E180G/S283A DMTG construct was then cloned into a vector containing the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) promoter and a human growth hormone poly(A) tail sequence (see Fig. 1A) (24.Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. Tissue-specific regulation of the α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter in transgenic mice.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DMTG mice were generated using the FVB/N strain, and founder mice were identified using PCR (25.Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L.

The α-Tm E180G TG mice and the α-Tm S283A mice were generated previously and extensively characterized with respect to their cardiac phenotype and function (8.Schulz E.M. Correll R.N. Sheikh H.N.

We confined our study to male mice because previous results showed sex-specific differences in the development of a compensated hypertrophic phenotype in the α-Tm S283A mice (8.Schulz E.M.

DNA samples were obtained from 5-day-old mice, and PCR was utilized to determine which animals carried the transgene. The following primers specific for the transgene were used: α-MHC Forward, 5′-GCC CAC ACC AGA AAT GAC AGA-3′; α-Tm Reverse, 5′-TCC AGT TCA TCT TCA GTG CCC-3′. GAPDH was used as an internal control, and the following primer set was used: GAPDH Forward, 5′-AGC GAG CTC AGG ACA TTC TGG-3′; GAPDH Reverse, 5′-CTC CTA ACC ACG CTC CTA GCA-3′. Myofibrillar proteins were extracted from NTG, α-Tm E180G, α-Tm S283A, and DMTG mouse ventricles as described previously (25.Muthuchamy M. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. O'Toole B.A. Kier A.B. Boivin G.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30593-30603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 25 μg of the myofibrillar protein preparations were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The presence of the α-Tm E180G mutation results in differential mobility in SDS-PAGE (23.Muthuchamy M. Pieples K. Rethinasamy P. Hoit B. Grupp I.L. Boivin G.P. Wolska B. Evans C. Solaro R.J.

Measurements were performed using ImageQuant 5.1. To confirm that the double mutant Tm was properly assembled into the sarcomere, cytoplasmic protein fractions (25 μg) isolated from 3-month-old NTG and DMTG male mice were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain. Western blot analyses on myofibrillar protein preparations (4 μg) from 3-month-old male NTG, α-Tm E180G, α-Tm S283A, and DMTG hearts were conducted using the Tm-specific antibody CH1 (Sigma-Aldrich), Tm Ser-283 phosphorylation-specific antibody generated for our laboratory (YenZyme), and sarcomeric α-actin antibody 5C5 (Sigma-Aldrich) as a loading control. Whole ventricular homogenates from 3-month-old NTG, α-Tm E180G, α-Tm S283A, and DMTG mice were utilized to visualize Ca2+-handling protein expression levels. Western blots were used to visualize SERCA2a (Abcam), troponin I (TnI) (Cell Signaling Technology), pTnI23/24 (Cell Signaling Technology), PLN (Thermo Scientific), phosphorylated PLN Ser-16 (Badrilla), and phosphorylated PLN Thr-17 (Badrilla). Sarcomeric actin (Sigma) was used as a loading control. Phosphorylated PLN levels are given as a ratio of the phosphorylated form over total PLN expression. Total PLN expression was calculated by adding the monomeric and pentameric species of PLN for each sample and normalizing to actin. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing PAGE was performed on mouse hearts as described previously (9.Warren C.M. Arteaga G.M. Rajan S. Ahmed R.P. Wieczorek D.F. Solaro R.J. Use of 2-D DIGE analysis reveals altered phosphorylation in a tropomyosin mutant (Glu54Lys) linked to dilated cardiomyopathy.Proteomics. 2008; 8: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3 μg of myofibrillar preparations were resolved on a 24-cm 4.0–5.0 immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing strip. The samples were then resolved in the second dimension by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to immunoblotting. Tm muscle-specific antibody CH1 was used to visualize both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated NTG and α-Tm E180G TG protein species. Mouse hearts from 3 to 13 months were isolated, weighed, and examined for histopathological changes. Heart weight to body weight ratios were calculated to determine evidence of cardiac hypertrophy. For histological analyses, the hearts were stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) or Masson's trichrome and evaluated for the presence of fibrosis, myocyte disarray, and calcification. Images were taken on a Nikon SM2–2T dissecting microscope and an Olympus BX4C compound microscope. To quantify changes in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, tissue sections were stained with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Texas Red (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize cardiomyocyte membranes. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei of cardiomyocytes. Randomized images of the left ventricular free wall were taken using a fluorescence camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area was measured using NIH ImageJ. RNA was isolated from 3-month-old NTG, α-Tm E180G, α-Tm S283A, and DMTG mouse ventricular tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated using the Superscript III kit (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was performed using an Opticon 2 real time RT-PCR machine (MJ Research). Each sample was measured in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated twice. Target mRNA was normalized to GAPDH expression as described by Pfaffl (26.Pfaffl M.W. A new mathematical model for relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25499) Google Scholar). The following specific primers were used: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) Forward, 5′-GCTTCCAGGCCATATTGGAG-3′; ANP Reverse, 5′-GGGGGCATGACCTCATCTT-3; β-MHC Forward, 5′-TCATCCGAATCCATTTTGGG-3′; β-MHC Reverse, 5′-CATAATCGTAGGGGTTGTTG-3′; brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) Forward, 5′-GAGGTCACTCCTATCCTCTGG-3′; BNP Reverse, 5′-GCCATTTCCTCCGACTTTTCTC-3′; GAPDH Forward, 5′-TGACCACAGTCCATGCCATC-3′; GAPDH Reverse, 5′-GACGGACACATTGGGGGTAG-3′. Echocardiographic measurements were performed utilizing a high resolution transducer (Vevo 770 High Resolution Imaging System with a center frequency of 30 MHz) after anesthetization of 3-month-old mice as described previously (27.Rajan S. Jagatheesan G. Karam C.N. Alves M.L. Bodi I. Schwartz A. Bulcao C.F. D'Souza K.M. Akhter S.A. Boivin G.P. Dube D.K. Petrashevskaya N. Herr A.B. Hullin R. Liggett S.B. Wolska B.M. Solaro R.J.

M-mode images of the left ventricle (LV), LV outflow tract, and left atrium were taken from the left parasternal long axis view. The parasternal short axis view at the level of the papillary muscles was used to measure the LV internal dimension, anterior wall thickness, and posterior wall thickness. NTG and TG 12–16-week-old mice were examined. Pulsed Doppler was performed with the apical four-chamber view. The mitral inflow was recorded with the Doppler sample volume at the tip of the mitral valve leaflets. To measure time intervals, the Doppler sample volume was moved toward the LV outflow tract, and both the mitral inflow and LV outflow were obtained in the same recording. Three parameters of the LV diastolic function were evaluated: 1) E/A ratio, which is the maximal velocity of blood flow in the early diastole (E)/maximal velocity of blood flow in the late diastole (A); 2) E wave deceleration time, which is the time from E to the end of the early diastole; and 3) LV isovolumic relaxation time, which is the time measured from the aortic valve closure to the mitral valve opening. Additional information about the diastolic function was obtained with tissue Doppler imaging. Peak myocardial velocities in the early (Em) diastole were obtained with the sample volume at the septal side of the mitral annulus in the four-chamber view. All measurements and calculations were averaged from three consecutive cycles and performed according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (28.Lang R.M. Bierig M. Devereux R.B.

Fiber bundles from papillary muscles of 5-month-old male NTG and TG hearts were detergent-extracted in high relaxing buffer as described previously (27.Rajan S. Jagatheesan G. Karam C.N. Alves M.L.

The sarcomeric length was adjusted to 2.3 μm using laser diffraction patterns, and isometric tension was measured. Fiber bundles were then subjected to sequential Ca2+ solutions (pCa), and isometric tension was again measured. All experiments were carried out at 22 °C. All statistics are presented as mean ± S.E. Where appropriate, paired and unpaired t tests, analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction, and analysis of variance with repeated measures were used to detect significance. Significance was set at p < 0.05. To determine the role of α-Tm phosphorylation in the context of a progressive, genetic cardiac disease, we generated a DMTG mouse model that expressed a non-phosphorylatable alanine at amino acid 283, the location of the sole known phosphorylation site in striated muscle α-Tm (2.Mak A. Smillie L.B. Bárány M. Specific phosphorylation at serine-"
https://openalex.org/W2090416725,"8-Oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1) removes premutagenic lesion 8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G) from DNA and then nicks the nascent abasic (apurinic/apyrimidinic) site by β-elimination. Although the structure of OGG1 bound to damaged DNA is known, the dynamic aspects of 8-oxo-G recognition are not well understood. To comprehend the mechanisms of substrate recognition and processing, we have constructed OGG1 mutants with the active site occluded by replacement of Cys-253, which forms a wall of the base-binding pocket, with bulky leucine or isoleucine. The conformational dynamics of OGG1 mutants were characterized by single-turnover kinetics and stopped-flow kinetics with fluorescent detection. Additionally, the conformational mobility of wild type and the mutant OGG1 substrate complex was assessed using molecular dynamics simulations. Although pocket occlusion distorted the active site and greatly decreased the catalytic activity of OGG1, it did not fully prevent processing of 8-oxo-G and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites. Both mutants were notably stimulated in the presence of free 8-bromoguanine, indicating that this base can bind to the distorted OGG1 and facilitate β-elimination. The results agree with the concept of enzyme plasticity, suggesting that the active site of OGG1 is flexible enough to compensate partially for distortions caused by mutation."

In this study, we show that changes in expression levels of two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, also affect mTORC1 signaling activity. In cells overexpressing Bcl-XL, mTORC1 activity is increased and becomes less sensitive to growth factor or nutrient conditions. In contrast, reduction in expression levels of the two antiapoptotic proteins inhibits mTORC1 signaling activity. Our results suggest that the effect of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL on mTORC1 is mediated by FKBP38, an inhibitor of mTORC1.

https://openalex.org/W1965185167,"Vam7p, the vacuolar soluble Qc-SNARE, is essential for yeast vacuole fusion. The large tethering complex, homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex (HOPS), and phosphoinositides, which interact with the Vam7p PX domain, have each been proposed to serve as its membrane receptors. Studies with the isolated organelle cannot determine whether these receptor elements suffice and whether ligands or mutations act directly or indirectly on Vam7p binding to the membrane. Using pure components that are active in reconstituted vacuolar fusion, we now find that Vam7p binds to membranes through its combined affinities for several vacuolar membrane constituents: HOPS, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, SNAREs, and acidic phospholipids. Acidic lipids allow low concentrations of Vam7p to suffice for fusion; without acidic lipids, the block to fusion is partially bypassed by high concentrations of Vam7p."
https://openalex.org/W2000937700,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms differentially regulate platelet functional responses downstream of glycoprotein VI (GPVI) signaling, but the role of PKCs regulating upstream effectors such as Syk is not known. We investigated the role of PKC on Syk tyrosine phosphorylation using the pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X (GFX). GPVI-mediated phosphorylation on Syk Tyr-323, Tyr-352, and Tyr-525/526 was rapidly dephosphorylated, but GFX treatment inhibited this dephosphorylation on Tyr-525/526 in human platelets but not in wild type murine platelets. GFX treatment did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation on FcRγ chain or Src family kinases. Phosphorylation of Lat Tyr-191 and PLCγ2 Tyr-759 was also increased upon treatment with GFX. We evaluated whether secreted ADP is required for such dephosphorylation. Exogenous addition of ADP to GFX-treated platelets did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation on Syk. FcγRIIA- or CLEC-2-mediated Syk tyrosine phosphorylation was also potentiated with GFX in human platelets. Because potentiation of Syk phosphorylation is not observed in murine platelets, PKC-deficient mice cannot be used to identify the PKC isoform regulating Syk phosphorylation. We therefore used selective inhibitors of PKC isoforms. Only PKCβ inhibition resulted in Syk hyperphosphorylation similar to that in platelets treated with GFX. This result indicates that PKCβ is the isoform responsible for Syk negative regulation in human platelets. In conclusion, we have elucidated a novel pathway of Syk regulation by PKCβ in human platelets."

https://openalex.org/W2052511497,"In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, RNA polymerase III transcription was found to be dependent not upon the canonical TATA box-binding protein (TBP) but instead upon the TBP-related factor 1 (TRF1) (Takada, S., Lis, J. T., Zhou, S., and Tjian, R. (2000) Cell 101, 459-469). Here we confirm that transcription of fly tRNA genes requires TRF1. However, we unexpectedly find that U6 snRNA gene promoters are occupied primarily by TBP in cells and that knockdown of TBP, but not TRF1, inhibits U6 transcription in cells. Moreover, U6 transcription in vitro effectively utilizes TBP, whereas TBP cannot substitute for TRF1 to promote tRNA transcription in vitro. Thus, in fruit flies, different classes of RNA polymerase III promoters differentially utilize TBP and TRF1 for the initiation of transcription."

It belongs to the YCII superfamily, a group of proteins with largely unknown function. In this work, we utilized structural and functional studies, including the apo-form and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone binary complex crystal structures, computational analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis, to determine the dehydrochlorination mechanism. The His-Asp dyad, which initiates catalysis, is strongly conserved in YCII-like proteins. In addition, other catalytically important residues such as Pro-76, which orients the His-Asp catalytic dyad; Arg-17 and Ser-56, which form an oxyanion hole; and Asp-9, which stabilizes the oxyanion hole, are among the most highly conserved residues across the YCII superfamily members. The comprehensive characterization of TftG helps not only for identifying effective mechanisms for chloroaromatic dechlorination but also for understanding the functions of YCII superfamily members, which we propose to be lyases."

The nucleoside triphosphorylase activities of these enzymes are activated through allosteric communication between the nucleotide-binding site and the activator/effector/polymer interface to convert the free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis into molecular switching (G-proteins) or force generation (kinesins and myosin). We have investigated the ATPase mechanisms of wild-type and the S237C mutant of non-muscle myosin II motor from Dictyostelium discoideum. The S237C substitution occurs in the conserved metal-interacting switch-1, and we show that this substitution modulates the actomyosin interaction based on the divalent metal present in solution. Surprisingly, S237C shows rapid basal steady-state Mg2+- or Mn2+-ATPase kinetics, but upon binding actin, its MgATPase is inhibited. This actin inhibition is relieved by Mn2+, providing a direct and experimentally reversible linkage of switch-1 and the actin-binding cleft through the swapping of divalent metals in the reaction. Using pyrenyl-labeled F-actin, we demonstrate that acto·S237C undergoes slow and weak MgATP binding, which limits the rate of steady-state catalysis.

An unusual feature in the hydrophobic core of the gp41 loop region is the existence of a basic residue (Lys-601) at the center of the core (CXXKXXC) (Fig. 1C). The existence of a basic residue in that location disrupts the hydrophobic continuity of the core, which might be correlated with the proper function and structure of the loop. Moreover, alanine-scanning mutants of the loop show that two mutations in the loop core, K601A and L602A, decreased HIV-1 infectivity while keeping wild type (WT)-like levels of gp120 and gp41 (23.Jacobs A.

Here, we utilized biochemical and biophysical approaches to study the affect of the K601A and L602A mutations on the function and structure of the loop region inside and outside the membrane. For this purpose, peptides corresponding to the loop region were prepared with the mutations K601A and L602A that have an opposite effect on the hydrophobic level of the core (Fig. 1D). We found that outside the membrane, the K601A mutation abolished the ability of the loop to form a disulfide bond, whereas the L602A was not effective. In the membrane, the L602A mutation, but not that of the K601A, decreased the lipid mixing ability of the loop. Moreover, these defects were in correlation with alterations in the structure and proper conformation of the loop as revealed by antibody binding and circular dichroism spectroscopy.

The reaction product (2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate) was quantified in a spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance of visible light at 412 nm. The absorbance of DTNB without peptides was used as the blank control. Thin films were generated after dissolution of the lipids in a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of chloroform/methanol and then dried under a stream of nitrogen gas while they were rotated. Two populations of films were generated: (i) unlabeled, containing PC:Chol (9:1), and (ii) labeled, containing PC:Chol (9:1) and 0.6% m concentrations of NBD-PE and Rho-PE each. The films were lyophilized overnight, sealed with argon gas to prevent oxidation, and stored at −20 °C. Before an experiment, the films were suspended in PBS and vortexed for 1.5 min. The lipid suspension underwent five cycles of freezing-thawing followed by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes with 1- and 0.1-μm diameter pores 21 times to create the LUVs. Lipid mixing of LUVs was measured using a fluorescence probe dilution assay (26.Struck D.K. Hoekstra D. Pagano R.E. Use of resonance energy transfer to monitor membrane fusion.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 27.Lev N. Shai Y. Fatty acids can substitute the HIV fusion peptide in lipid merging and fusion. An analogy between viral and palmitoylated eukaryotic fusion proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). LUVs were prepared in PBS as described above from unlabeled and labeled films combined to yield a 9:1 molar ratio of a 100-μm final lipid concentration. The emission of NBD was monitored at 530 nm with the excitation set at 467 nm. The basal fluorescence level was measured initially for a 400-μl vesicle mixture. Then the peptides were dissolved in 2 μl of DMSO and added to the mixture. The fluorescence was monitored for several minutes after the peptide was added to ensure a steady state as indicated by a plateau. The increase in fluorescence induced by the peptides was referred as total lipid mixing. The inner leaflet mixing assay was modified from the method developed by Meers et al. (28.Meers P. Ali S. Erukulla R. Janoff A.S. Novel inner monolayer fusion assays reveal differential monolayer mixing associated with cation-dependent membrane fusion.Biochim Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The method is based on the fact that DTH reacts more rapidly with NBDs in the outer leaflet than those in the inner leaflet. After the lipid mixing of the peptides, DTH was added to the mixture in a final concentration of 32 mm. This concentration decreased maximum NBD fluorescence in the system, and higher DTH concentrations retained the same effect. The decrease in fluorescence was monitored until a plateau was reached. As a control, DTH was added to the LUVs that was treated only with DMSO. The difference between the steady state fluorescence of the peptide and the DMSO after DTH was added was referred as inner leaflet mixing. A 96-well plate was coated with the loop peptides in dose-dependent amounts (maximum of 1 μg/well) in 0.05 m sodium carbonate solution (pH 9.6) at 4 °C overnight. Then the plate was blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h followed by 1 h of incubation at 37 °C with gp41 loop-specific monoclonal antibodies. The following reagents were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 gp41 (246-D and 240-D) from Dr. Susan Zolla-Pazner (29.Xu J.Y.

Epitope map of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 derived from 47 monoclonal antibodies produced by immunization with oligomeric envelope protein.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2674-2684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the 246-D and T32 antibodies, the concentrations were 0.5 μg/ml (100 μl/well) and 0.4 μg/ml (100 μl/well), respectively. Next, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added for 1 h of incubation. The 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate and H2SO4 (1 m) were added sequentially. The amount of bound monoclonal antibodies was detected by monitoring the absorbance in 450 nm. Several antibody binding constants were determined by nonlinear least squares (NLLSQ) representing a steady state affinity model. The NLLSQ fitting was done using the equation, Y(x)=Ka×X×Fmax1+Ka×X(Eq. 1) where X is the peptide concentration, Y(x) is the antibody binding measured by absorbance (arbitrary units), Fmax is the maximal binding, and Ka is the antibody binding constant. A database was created from all the universal protein resource (UniProt) entries for a transmembrane protein of the envelope of HIV and SIV. These protein sequences were then run in a motif-based sequence analysis tool (MEME) that analyzes sequences for similarities among them and produces a description (motif) for each pattern it discovers. The motifs found were automatically arranged by their E-value, which is an estimate of the expected number of motifs with the given log likelihood ratio that one would find in a similarly sized set of random sequences. The log likelihood ratio is the logarithm of the ratio of the probability of the occurrences of the motif given the motif model versus their probability given the background model. The background model here is a 0-order Markov model using the background letter frequencies. The y axis is in bits, which is equal to the relative entropy of the motif relative to a uniform background frequency model. The relative entropy of the motif, computed in bits and relative to the background letter frequencies, is equal to the log-likelihood ratio (llr) divided by the number of contributing sites of the motif times 1/ln(2). To better view the sequence, the MEME results were run through WebLogo, which is designed to generate sequence logos as a method for graphical representation of amino acid sequence alignment. CD measurements were performed by using an Applied Photophysics spectropolarimeter. The spectra were scanned using a thermostatic quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 mm. Wavelength scans were performed at 25 °C; the average recording time was 15 s in 1-nm steps in the wavelength range of 190–260 nm. Peptides were scanned at a concentration of 10 μm in solution (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and in a membrane mimetic environment of 1% lysophosphatidylcholine in HEPES solution. Peptide interactions with membranes were analyzed and quantified using fluorescence anisotropy of their intrinsic Trp residue in the presence of PC:Chol (9:1) LUVs membranes. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 280/350 nm, respectively, and 1 μm peptide (in 400 μl of PBS) was titrated with 13.8 mm membrane solution successively. Because Trp is known to change its emission in a hydrophobic environment, a change in its emission represented the amount of peptide bound to membranes. The system reached binding equilibrium (Fmax) at a certain lipid/peptide ratio, allowing us to calculate the affinity constant from the relations between the equilibrium level of Trp emission and the lipid concentration (C) using a steady state affinity model. The affinity constants were determined by NLLSQ fitting (Equation 1), where X is the lipid concentration, Y(x) is the fluorescence emission, Fmax is the maximal difference in the emission of Trp-containing peptide before and after the addition of lipids (it represents the maximum peptide bound to lipid), and Ka is the affinity constant. We observed an unusual Lys incorporated in the hydrophobic core of the HIV-1 gp41 loop region (Lys-601) that disrupts the hydrophobic continuity of the core. We examined the conservation of this feature utilizing a bioinformatics approach. A database was created from all reported fusion proteins from HIV and SIV strains. The hydrophobic loop core is the most conserved sequence in the protein with an E-value of 4.0e−609 based on 75 sites contributing to the construction of the motif (Fig. 1C). The conservation of the two Cys residues was already established. Importantly, we report here that a charged residue (Lys or Arg) in between the Cys residue is a further conserved feature in the loop core. Peptides corresponding to the loop regions were prepared with the mutations K601A (termed L27 K601A) and L602A (termed L27 L602A). Both of the mutations decreased HIV-1 cell fusion when introduced to the inact ENV while keeping similar WT levels of the ENV (23.Jacobs A. Sen J. Rong L. Caffrey M. Alanine scanning mutants of the HIV gp41 loop.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27284-27288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These mutations change the local hydrophobicity in the disulfide core, whereas K601A or L602A increase or decrease hydrophobicity. The effect of the mutations on the overall hydrophobicity of the loop was analyzed by their retention times in the RP-HPLC and by the calculated grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) index. Both methods showed that the overall hydrophobicity of the loop was affected by these mutations in a corresponding manner (Table 1 and Fig. 1D).TABLE 1Designation, sequence, and hydrophobicity values of the peptides used in this study as well as the infectivity rate of each of the mutationsDesignationgp41 locationSequenceHIV-1 infectivityaEffect of the Env mutations on viral infectivity.
