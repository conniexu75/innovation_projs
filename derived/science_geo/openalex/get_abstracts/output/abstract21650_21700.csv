https://openalex.org/W2071607446,"Metallothionein-directed expression of TGF alpha in transgenic mice induced a spectrum of changes in the growth and differentiation of certain adult tissues. First, TGF alpha promoted a uniform epithelial hyperplasia of several organs without otherwise causing major alterations in tissue architecture. Second, in pancreas it promoted proliferation of both acinar cells and fibroblasts and focally altered acinar cell differentiation. The magnitude of this response was proportional to the level of local, tissue-specific TGF alpha expression and was reproduced when expression of TGF alpha was placed under the control of the elastase promoter, implying an autocrine or paracrine mechanism. Third, TGF alpha was oncogenic in vivo. It caused dramatic hyperplasia and dysplasia of the coagulation gland epithelium, which displayed evidence of carcinoma in situ, and in postlactational mammary gland it induced secretory mammary adenocarcinomas. Thus, TGF alpha displays characteristics of both a potent epithelial cell mitogen and an oncogenic protein in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1555733423,"An inhibitor of the high conductance, Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel (PK,Ca) has been purified to homogeneity from venom of the scorpion Buthus tamulus by a combination of ion exchange and reversed-phase chromatography. This peptide, which has been named iberiotoxin (IbTX), is one of two minor components of the crude venom which blocks PK,Ca. IbTX consists of a single 4.3-kDa polypeptide chain, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analysis of amino acid composition, and Edman degradation. Its complete amino acid sequence has been defined. IbTX displays 68% sequence homology with charybdotoxin (ChTX), another scorpion-derived peptidyl inhibitor of PK,Ca, and, like this latter toxin, its amino terminus contains a pyroglutamic acid residue. However, IbTX possesses 4 more acidic and 1 less basic amino acid residue than does ChTX, making this toxin much less positively charged than the other peptide. In single channel recordings, IbTX reversibly blocks PK,Ca in excised membrane patches from bovine aortic smooth muscle. It acts exclusively at the outer face of the channel and functions with an IC50 of about 250 pM. Block of channel activity appears distinct from that of ChTX since IbTX decreases both the probability of channel opening as well as the channel mean open time. IbTX is a selective inhibitor of PK,Ca; it does not block other types of voltage-dependent ion channels, especially other types of K+ channels that are sensitive to inhibition by ChTX. IbTX is a partial inhibitor of 125I-ChTX binding in bovine aortic sarcolemmal membrane vesicles (Ki = 250 pM). The maximal extent of inhibition that occurs is modulated by K+, decreasing as K+ concentration is raised, but K+ does not affect the absolute inhibitory potency of IbTX. A Scatchard analysis indicates that IbTX functions as a noncompetitive inhibitor of ChTX binding. Taken together, these data suggest that IbTX interacts at a distinct site on the channel and modulates ChTX binding by an allosteric mechanism. Therefore, IbTX defines a new class of peptidyl inhibitor of PK,Ca with unique properties that make it useful for investigating the characteristics of this channel in target tissues."

A protein derived from cartilage was purified that inhibits angiogenesis in vivo and capillary endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro in three separate bioassays. This protein is also an inhibitor of mammalian collagenase. These findings may help elucidate the mechanisms by which neovascularization is controlled in both normal and pathological states."
https://openalex.org/W1563962170,"The monokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibits endothelial cell growth and induces prostacyclin production in human endothelial cells. Since cyclooxygenase (Cox) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostanoids, we evaluated the ability of IL-1 to stimulate Cox expression by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Our data demonstrate that 1) the Cox mRNA is expressed at low levels in untreated cells; 2) IL-1 alpha induces the Cox mRNA within 2 h, and this induction is sustained for more than 24 h; 3) IL-1 alpha induction is dose-dependent; 4) cycloheximide potentiates the induction of the Cox mRNA by IL-1 alpha while actinomycin D prevents the induction, and 5) IL-1 alpha also stimulates Cox production in a time-dependent fashion which correlates with the increase in prostacyclin synthesis. These data suggest that Cox is an immediate-early gene induced by IL-1 in HUVEC and may contribute to the regulation of the endothelial cell differentiation pathway in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1523878042,"Endoglin is a major glycoprotein of human vascular endothelium. As observed with monoclonal antibody 44G4, the distribution of endoglin is restricted to endothelial cells in all tissues except bone marrow. cDNA clones were isolated from an endothelial cell lambda gt11 cDNA library using a rabbit antibody prepared against endoglin purified from placenta. Eleven antibody-positive and cross-hybridizing clones were obtained; reactivity with endothelial cell 3.4-kilobase mRNA transcript was observed. The N-terminal sequence of placental endoglin was determined and found within the deduced protein sequence, thus confirming the identity of the cDNA and revealing a partial signal peptide. Endoglin is a type I integral membrane protein of Mr = 68,051 with an extracellular region of 561 amino acids, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a 47-residue cytoplasmic tail. There are four potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the N-terminal domain and a probable O-glycan domain rich in Ser and Thr residues proximal to the membrane-spanning domain. Data base searches revealed that endoglin is a novel protein. The sequence contains an RGD tripeptide (374-376), the first identified on a surface protein of endothelium. The presence of RGD, a key recognition structure in cellular adhesion, suggests a critical role for endoglin in the binding of endothelial cells to integrins and/or other RGD receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2124626123,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) may be an autoimmune disease mediated by T cells specific for a myelin protein. Investigations have demonstrated myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive T cells that were activated in vivo in MS patients, suggesting that MBP may be a target antigen in MS. The variable (V) region of the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain was examined among 83 T cell lines from both MS patients and healthy subjects that were reactive with the immunodominant region of human MBP (residues 84 to 102) or with a second immunodominant region of MBP (143 to 168). V beta 17 and to a lesser extent V beta 12 were frequently used in recognition of MBP(84-102) among different individuals. In contrast, V beta 17 was very infrequent among lines reactive with MBP (143-168). These data demonstrate shared TCR V beta gene usage for the recognition of immunodominant regions of the human autoantigen MBP. Such TCR structures may be used as targets for specific immunotherapy in MS."

https://openalex.org/W1524285426,"We have purified a novel member of the integrin gene family from placenta that serves as a vitronectin receptor. This integrin is composed of the alpha v subunit and a beta subunit that we designate beta 5. Purification was accomplished by immunodepleting a placental extract of integrin alpha v beta 3, allowing us to purify alpha v beta 5 from the remaining extract by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on LM 142-Sepharose, which binds to the alpha v subunit. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently achieved by affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 3 demonstrated that beta 3 and beta 5 were distinct but confirmed that the alpha subunit of the two integrins were immunologically identical. Similarly, antibodies that bind beta 3 proximal to the ligand-binding site failed to react with beta 5, indicating an architectural difference at the ligand-binding site of these related integrins. This structural difference apparently results in a functional distinction, since purified alpha v beta 3 bound to vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin, whereas integrin alpha v beta 5 bound preferentially to vitronectin. Finally, we demonstrate by three criteria that beta 5 and beta x, the latter of which was identified in lung carcinoma cells (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), are identical. First, peptide maps of beta x and beta 5 are identical. Secondly, polyclonal antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 immunoprecipitate both beta 5 and beta x, and finally, the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of beta x and beta 5 are identical."
https://openalex.org/W2143653514,"Guide RNAs (gRNAs) for the editing of sites 1-8 of COIII mRNA and an ""unexpected"" partially edited COIII mRNA are encoded in the variable regions of specific kinetoplast DNA minicircles. The gRNAs can form 37 and 44 nucleotide perfect hybrids (allowing for G-U base pairs) with edited mRNAs. The gRNAs were detected on Northern blots and shown to have unique 5' ends situated close to the beginning of the potential base pairing with the edited mRNAs. We suggest that kinetoplast DNA minicircle molecules in general may encode gRNAs for editing of cryptogene mRNAs by a mechanism similar to that previously proposed for editing by maxicircle-encoded gRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1485697910,"The composition of the two-chain coiled-coil molecule of murine epidermal keratin intermediate filaments (KIF) containing keratins 1 (type II) and 10 (type I) has been explored using native-type KIF as well as KIF reassembled in vitro from protein dissolved in urea solutions or from mixtures of 3H-labeled and unlabeled purified chains. By use of cross-linking, high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting for 3H-labeled keratins or with an anti-mouse keratin 10 antibody, it was found that individual keratin chains form type I or type II homodimers and homotetramers in solution that do not assemble into KIF in vitro. When mixed in urea solutions of 5 M or greater, such homo-oligomers rapidly rearrange into mostly heterodimers and heterotetramers that support filament assembly. On the other hand, prekeratin, isolated from newborn mouse epidermis with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 2.6, under conditions that do not dissociate the native coiled-coil molecule, consists exclusively of type I-II heterodimers and heterotetramers. It is necessary to dissolve prekeratin in 8-9.5 M urea for several hours in order to dissociate the native heterodimer molecule and incorporate tracer amounts of a single 3H-labeled keratin chain. These data establish that native KIF consist of heterodimer coiled-coil molecules. Furthermore, heterodimers are much more stable than homodimers and are the favored form of association in solution. However, some homodimers (10-30% of total) always form after dissolution in concentrated urea and can be assimilated into KIF during reassembly in vitro. The isolation of alpha-helix-enriched dimer particles from the 2B region of the rod domains upon limited proteolysis confirmed the presence of mostly heterodimer and some homodimer molecules in reassembled KIF. These properties of keratin chains in urea solutions hereby clarify a number of conflicting reports in the literature concerning the composition of the coiled-coil molecule. The presence of some homo-oligomeric species in reassembled KIF correlates with earlier observations of polymorphism as well as stoichiometry."
https://openalex.org/W2070921744,"The immunosuppressive agents cyclosporin A and FK506 inhibit the transcription of early T cell activation genes. The binding proteins for cyclosporin A and FK506, cyclophilin and FKBP, respectively, are peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans isomerases, or rotamases. One proposed mechanism for rotamase catalysis by cyclophilin involves a tetrahedral adduct of an amide carbonyl and an enzyme-bound nucleophile. The potent FKBP rotamase inhibitor FK506 has a highly electrophilic carbonyl that is adjacent to an acyl-pipicolinyl (homoprolyl) amide bond. Such a functional group would be expected to form a stabilized, enzyme-bound tetrahedral adduct. Spectroscopic and chemical evidence reveals that the drug interacts noncovalently with its receptor, suggesting that the alpha-keto amid of FK506 serves as a surrogate for the twisted amide of a bound peptide substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1497536572,"Recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase has been used to investigate the process of dimer formation and the properties of the different mono- and dimeric forms of the enzyme. The studies show that reverse transcriptase activity is exclusively confined to the dimeric forms. As we also demonstrate, the association rate constant between the monomers is relatively low so that the dimer-monomer equilibrium is very slowly established. This offers a new and potentially interesting target for antiviral chemotherapy with presumably higher specificity than the currently used nucleoside analogs (Yarchoan, R., Mitsuya, H., Myers, C.E., and Broder, S. (1989) N. Eng. J. Med. 321, 726-738), which in their active triphosphorylated form are also inhibitors of cellular polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1567544003,"Tissue factor (TF) is the membrane-bound glycoprotein whose cofactor activity with factor VIIa causes activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. The transition of endothelium to a procoagulant state by agents such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the result of TF expression by these cells. The mechanism of TF induction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was investigated in response to LPS and phorbol 12-myristate 13-O-acetate (PMA). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from HUVEC showed a rapid rise in TF mRNA levels which was maximal at 2 h and had fallen to low levels by 6 h following both LPS (10 micrograms/ml) and PMA (10 ng/ml) stimulation. Nuclear-run on experiments showed at most a 2-fold increase in transcription of the TF gene following LPS stimulation but a 10-fold increase following PMA stimulation. In addition 24-h pre-incubation with PMA desensitized HUVEC to further PMA exposure, but caused no alteration in the response to LPS. Cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml) alone caused induction of TF mRNA. Treatment of cells previously exposed to LPS for 1 or 4 h with actinomycin D indicated a 12-fold difference in the TF mRNA half-life. Therefore the rapid accumulation of TF mRNA in HUVEC stimulated by LPS is largely a result of an increase in mRNA stability rather than an increased rate of transcription of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W1738235581,"Trypanosome variant surface glycoproteins exemplify a class of eukaryotic cell surface glycoproteins that rely on a carboxyl-terminal covalently-attached inositol-containing glycophospholipid for membrane attachment. The glycolipid anchor is acquired soon after translation of the polypeptide, apparently by replacement of a short carboxyl-terminal peptide sequence with a prefabricated glycolipid. A candidate glycolipid precursor (referred to as P2), and a related glycolipid (P3) have been identified recently in polar lipid extracts from trypanosomes. In this paper we describe the synthesis of P2 and P3 by trypanosome membranes. Analyses of organic solvent extracts from membranes incubated with radioactive sugar nucleotides (GDP-[3H]mannose or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc) showed a spectrum of labelled lipids, ranging from partially glycosylated species to the final products, P2 and P3. Structural analyses of these putative biosynthetic intermediates suggest that glycolipid assembly occurs via the sequential glycosylation of phosphatidylinositol."
https://openalex.org/W2054964020,"We recently described the characterization and cloning of Drosophila neuroglian, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Neuroglian contains six immunoglobulin-like domains and five fibronectin type III domains and shows strong sequence homology to the mouse neural cell adhesion molecule L1. Here we show that the neuroglian gene generates at least two different protein products by tissue-specific alternative splicing. The two protein forms differ in their cytoplasmic domains. The long form is restricted to the surface of neurons in the CNS and neurons and some support cells in the PNS; in contrast, the short form is expressed on a wide range of other cells and tissues. Thus, whereas the mouse L1 gene appears to encode only one protein that functions largely as a neural cell adhesion molecule, its Drosophila homolog, the neuroglian gene, encodes at least two protein forms that may play two different roles, one as a neural cell adhesion molecule and the other as a more general cell adhesion molecule involved in other tissues and imaginal disc morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1578577647,"A complete cDNA encoding cholesterol 7 alpha-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.17) which had been isolated from rat liver cDNA libraries by using specific antibodies to the enzyme (Noshiro, M., Nishimoto, M., and Okuda, K. (1989) FEBS Lett. 257, 97-100) was totally sequenced. The cDNA contained a 1,509-base pair open reading frame encoding 503 amino acid residues (Mr = 56,880) and an unusually long 3'-untranslated region rich in AT sequence in the total length of 3,545 base pairs. The predicted amino acid sequence displays less than 30% similarity to other sequenced cytochrome P-450s indicating that the 7 alpha-hydroxylase constitutes a novel family of cytochrome P-450. The AT-rich region often contained ATTTA motifs, 5'-AAT-3' or 5'-TAA-3' trinucleotides which were reported to be involved in rapidly degrading mRNA. Employing the specific antibodies and the cDNA as probes, a diurnal variation of the levels of the three factors, i.e. enzyme protein, mRNA, and enzyme activity, was studied on rat livers prepared at various times of the day. In normal animals, all three factors exhibited maximum level at 10:00 p.m. and minimum at 10:00 a.m. No significant sexual difference was observed. Cholestyramine feeding increased all three factors at 10:00 a.m. close to the maximum levels of the normal rats, but did not show a significant increase at 10:00 p.m. On the contrary, starvation markedly decreased all three factors either at 10:00 a.m. or at 10:00 p.m., while maintaining still the diurnal variation. A good correlation of the levels of mRNA to the enzyme activities and the protein levels demonstrates that pretranslational regulation is most likely a mechanism for the circadian rhythm of 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The marked diurnal fluctuation of the amount of protein and the level of mRNA also indicates their rapid turnover. The short half-life of mRNA could be correlated with the structure of the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA characteristic of rapidly degrading mRNA, i.e. abundance of motif, AUUUA, and existence of 5'-AAU-3' or 5'-UAA-3' trinucleotides in single-stranded regions of the secondary structure."

https://openalex.org/W2124295223,"The specificity of mature CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes is controlled by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules, respectively. The MHC class specificity of T cells is stringent in many assays, but is less evident when cells are supplemented with exogenous lymphokines. The repertoire of T cells is shaped through contact with MHC molecules in the thymus and involves a complex process of positive selection and negative selection (tolerance). Tolerance of immature T cells to MHC molecules can reflect either clonal deletion or anergy and results from intrathymic contact with several cell types, including epithelial cells and cells with antigen-presenting function. Unlike immature T cells, mature T cells are relatively resistant to tolerance induction. In certain situations partial unresponsiveness of mature T cells can be achieved by exposing T cells to foreign MHC molecules expressed on atypical antigen-presenting cells. Tolerance is rarely complete, however, and the precise requirements for tolerizing mature T cells are still unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1966857238,"RNA editing is the specific posttranscriptional insertion/deletion of U residues within trypanosomatid mitochondrial transcripts. We used a novel cDNA cloning scheme and analyzed partially edited COIII and CYb RNAs. Our major unanticipated findings are: First, editing appears strikingly indiscriminate within editing domains, inserting and deleting variable numbers of U residues at all sites, both those requiring editing and those that do not. Second, this incomplete editing occurs in precise domains, not in adjacent regions unedited in mature mRNA. Third, editing appears to commence prior to polyadenylation. We propose that within a region being edited, there are cycles of indiscriminate cleavage, U addition or deletion, and religation; sites that become correctly edited would be protected from further modification by duplexing with short RNAs complementary to the edited sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1562551320,"As a means of determining how elongating RNA polymerase responds to a protein in its path, transcription has been carried out in vitro with the purified Escherichia coli enzyme on templates associated with a sequence-specific DNA binding protein. The major RNA species generated is the length expected from RNA polymerase which has transcribed to the position of the bound protein and is unable to elongate further. The binding proteins used are two mutants of the EcoRI endonuclease which are defective in cleavage function but retain high affinity for the wild-type recognition sequence (Wright, D. J., King, K., and Modrich, P. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11816-11821). Blockage of RNA polymerase occurs on linear and circular templates and, although efficient with both proteins, is more effective for the EcoRI derivative with the slower dissociation rate. The protein-blocked transcription complexes are stable over time and remain in an active form, resuming elongation when the blocking protein is displaced by an increase in ionic strength. These paused ternary complexes, if treated with the termination factor rho, undergo release. The 3' ends of the blocked-length RNAs from DNAs of distinct sequences reveal that the ternary complexes are positioned at a constant distance from the protein block, 14 nucleotides upstream of the EcoRI recognition sequence. This information is combined with exonuclease III footprinting data to position the 3' end of the nascent RNA chain in the ternary complex quite near (approximately 7 nucleotides) the leading edge of RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2014930502,"The lymph node homing receptor core polypeptide (mLHRc) is composed of a tandem collection of domains: a lectin domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain, and two repeats common in complement regulatory proteins. Here we demonstrate localization of mLHRc to chromosome 1, the portion syntenic with chromosome 1 in man. This locus is inseparable in mouse strains from the murine lymphocyte cell surface marker Ly-22. The data indicate that Ly-22 is an allelic determinant on the LHR resulting from a single amino acid interchange within the EGF domain. Cross-blocking experiments demonstrate that anti-Ly-22 and MEL-14 recognize independent epitopes and that Ly-22 is distinct from the carbohydrate binding region. Application of anti-Ly-22 in the in vitro binding assay shows inhibition of binding of lymphocytes to high endothelial venules (HEVs). The localization of the Ly-22 epitope in this novel chimeric protein suggests direct participation of the EGF domain in the adhesion of lymphocytes to HEV."
https://openalex.org/W1555146480,"We have analyzed the processing of the RNA primer for (+) strand DNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus 1. To test for specific RNA cleavage and primer usage, we constructed a 99-base pair RNA-DNA hybrid containing the viral polypurine tract and flanking viral sequences. Although the RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase cleaves the RNA strand into multiple fragments, only two primers are extended in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates. The major RNA primer includes the entire polypurine tract except for the last adenosine and has the sequence 5'-UUUUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGG-3'. The minor primer has the same 3' end but is two nucleotides shorter. In a subsequent processing step reverse transcriptase releases the primer intact via a cleavage at the RNA-DNA junction. RNA cleavage, primer extension, and primer removal can take place in a single reaction. However, specificity does not require coupling of the three steps and is preserved in the individual reactions. The polypurine primer is generated and removed after its elongation in the absence of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, the polypurine primer is selected among the several RNA fragments available and extended by reverse transcriptase as well as by p51, a short form of reverse transcriptase lacking RNase H activity."
https://openalex.org/W1575640712,"Vitamin K-dependent protein S is an anticoagulant plasma protein functioning as a cofactor to activated protein C in the degradation of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa. To determine which regions in protein S are important for its cofactor activity, we have raised and characterized a large panel of monoclonal antibodies against human protein S. Several of the antibodies were directed against Ca2(+)-dependent epitopes, and they were found to be located either in the domain containing gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla), the thrombin-sensitive region, or in the first epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain. The first two types of epitopes were exposed at approximately 1 mM Ca2+, whereas the epitope(s) in the EGF-like domains required less than 1 microM Ca2+, suggesting the presence of one or more high affinity Ca2(+)-binding site(s). The antibodies, as well as their Fab' fragments, against all three types of Ca2(+)-dependent epitopes efficiently inhibited the activated protein C cofactor function of protein S, but through different mechanisms. The antibodies against the Gla domain exerted their effects through inhibition of protein S binding to negatively charged phospholipid. Fab'-fragments of antibodies against the thrombin-sensitive region and the first EGF-like domain were the most potent inhibitors of the activated protein C cofactor function but did not inhibit phospholipid binding of protein S. In conclusion, we have identified the domains in protein S that are important for the activated protein C cofactor activity. The Gla domain is instrumental in the binding of protein S to phospholipid, whereas the thrombin-sensitive region and the first EGF-like domain may be directly involved in protein-protein interactions on the phospholipid surface."

They are, in cooperation with corresponding cations, responsible for the generation and regulation of an internal osmotic pressure that amounts up to 150 bar (Weber, J. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 184, 465-476). The anions are organized as linear homopolymers of L-glutamic acids which are linked by gamma-carboxyl-alpha-amino amide bonds; the degree of polymerization is heterogeneous and dependent on the particular type of nematocyst. In situ the intracapsular glutamic acid monomer concentration is as high as 2 M. This is the first time that poly(gamma-glutamic acid)s, which are known to occur in some selected bacteria, are reported for eucaryotes. It is suggested that they may also be present as predominant components in nematocysts of other cnidarian species and thus might represent a class of compounds which is characteristic for a whole phylum of the animal kingdom."

The MHC class II I-E and I-A and class I H-2K molecules expressed specifically on pancreatic islet or acinar cells serve as model self antigens. In these systems, transgenic proteins are not detected in the thymus or other lymphoid tissues. Yet mice are tolerant to the pancreatic MHC products in vivo; this tolerance is not induced by clonal deletion. These studies have been aided by monoclonal antibodies specific for I-E-reactive T cells and indicate that clonal anergy may be an important mechanism of tolerance to peripheral proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1596074449,"Porin, a channel-forming protein spanning bacterial outer membranes, was denatured in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride or, alternatively, in sodium dodecyl sulfate at 95 degrees C. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that this protein, which in its native state consist of beta-pleated sheets as the sole detectable secondary structure, is transformed into random coil configuration in the chaotropic agent, or into alpha-helical structure in the detergent. From either state, the mature protein refolds in presence of amphiphilic molecules, attaining full structural and functional competence. As structural criteria, the native trimeric state was assayed by analytical ultracentrifugation, gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, protease resistance, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Channel formation in planar lipid bilayers reveals that the refolded protein is also functionally competent. It is concluded that the information required for the complete folding of porin is contained within the primary sequence of the mature polypeptide. The study of rapid refolding clearly reveals that this process occurs in the time range of seconds and that preexisting bilayers are not a prerequisite."
https://openalex.org/W1537934758,"We report cell-attached patch clamp studies of intact human platelets which show receptor-activated single channels. Inclusion of ADP in the patch pipette, but not in the bath, resulted in the appearance of inward currents indicative of single channels tightly coupled to the ADP receptors. The channels had a slope conductance of 11 picosiemens at the resting potential. Removal of 1 mM Ca2+ or replacement of chloride by gluconate in the pipette filling solution had little effect on the slope conductance at the resting potential or on the estimated reversed potential. With isotonic BaCl2 in the pipette, ADP evoked single channel currents with a slope conductance of 10 picosiemens. Thus these channels appear to be permeable to monovalent and divalent cations and selective for cations over anions. Addition of 5 mM Ni2+ (which blocks ADP-evoked rapid calcium entry in fura-2-loaded platelets) to the pipette solution blocked ADP-evoked channel activity. These channels may therefore provide an important mechanism for ADP to activate human platelets within a small fraction of a second."
https://openalex.org/W1575863011,"The purification of pp60c-src has been hampered by the low levels of protein it represents in most cells and its tendency to undergo proteolysis during purification. The discovery that the platelet expresses unusually high levels of pp60c-src has made large-scale purification from a normal source feasible. We have developed a method for the purification of intact pp60c-src to near homogeneity from human platelets and have determined the enzymatic properties of this purified protein in vitro. Rapid, high yield purification of pp60c-src from isolated platelet membranes was achieved in a two-step protocol involving sequential chromatography on an anti-pp60c-src immunoaffinity matrix and phenyl-Sepharose. This protocol yielded 0.5 mg of pp60c-src from 30 units of platelets. Using enolase as an exogenous substrate, the specific activity of the enzyme was 25 nmol P.min-1.mg-1. The Km for MnATP2- for enolase phosphorylation (2.2 microM) was higher than for the autophosphorylation of pp60c-src (0.6 microM). Maximal enzyme activity required either Mn2+ or Mg2+, and both ATP and GTP could be utilized as the phosphate donor. Evidence is shown which indicate that the autophophorylation of pp60c-src in vitro occurs through an intramolecular mechanism and that this reaction is reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1558534829,"The sequential epitopes on the human insulin receptor recognized by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were investigated using a recombinant DNA technique. Short random fragments of receptor cDNA were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as beta-galactosidase fusion proteins by using the expression vector pUEX1. Immunoreactive peptides were detected by colony blotting and identified by sequencing the corresponding cDNA inserts. Eleven antigenic determinants were located with rabbit antisera, nine of these being on the alpha-subunit and two on the beta-subunit of which one was intracellular. Two human autoantibodies reacted with the alpha-subunit on blots, but no sequential epitopes could be located. In the rabbit sera, antibody reacting with these linear epitopes represented a substantial fraction (approximately 50%) of antibody reacting with reduced denatured receptor on blots, but a generally smaller fraction (5-40%) of antibody reacting with solubilized native receptor. Epitope-specific subfractions of antibodies were purified by binding to an elution from bacterial fusion proteins. All of these subfractions reacted with denatured receptor on nitrocellulose blots, but only three precipitated native receptor (epitopes between amino acids 190 and 231, 654 and 669, 954 and 982) and none inhibited insulin binding.

A., and Rutter, W. J. (1985) Cell 40, 747-758). The binding sites of two monoclonal antibodies were also determined. One of these antibodies (83-14) is insulin-mimetic, but inhibits insulin binding and its epitope on the alpha-subunit (between amino acids 469 and 592) may contribute to the insulin binding site in the folded protein. The other antibody (18-44) binds close to the N terminus of the beta-subunit (amino acids 765-770) and does not inhibit insulin binding, but does mimic insulin action. The identification of epitopes therefore provides information on receptor conformation and allows structural domains to be identified which are involved in the functional effects of different antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1517781292,"The osmB gene, which encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein, can be induced by both osmotic and growth phase signals. Construction of two transcriptional fusions, an osmB-lacZ fusion in single copy on the bacterial chromosome and an osmB-cat fusion carried on a multicopy plasmid, demonstrated that induction of osmB by hyperosmolarity and during the stationary phase of growth occurred at the level of transcription. Two transcription initiation sites were identified by RNase protection of in vivo message. The downstream P2 promoter is the primary site for regulation; the basal level of expression is initiated at P2 and transcription from P2 is induced by elevated osmolarity or upon reaching stationary phase. Transcription from the P1 promoter, 150 base pairs (bp) upstream of the P2 promoter, occurred only when both osmotic and growth phase signals were present simultaneously; that is, when cells growing in high osmolarity medium have reached stationary phase. Deletion analysis narrowed the sequences necessary for P2 regulation to the 42-bp region upstream from the transcription start site. A 7-bp sequence just upstream from the -35 region was identified as a cis-acting regulatory element essential for osmotic stimulation of osmB expression. A hexanucleotide sequence within this segment could form the left arm of a region of dyad symmetry, flanking the -35 region of the promoter. Stationary phase induction at P2 does not require the 7-bp element."

A substitution of an evolutionarily invariant amino acid (Lys1065----Arg) in the beta subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase apparently disrupts its catalytic center. The mutant protein inhibited cell growth when expressed from an inducible promoter. The assembled holoenzyme carrying the mutant subunit formed stable promoter complexes that continuously synthesized promoter-specific dinucleotides but that did not enter the elongation step. The mutant polymerase inhibited transcription by blocking the access of the wild-type enzyme to promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1591039202,"The CD34 antigen is a human leukocyte membrane protein expressed specifically by lymphohematopoietic progenitor cells. We found that CD34 is a phosphoprotein and therefore examined the regulation of its phosphorylation. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) enhanced CD34 phosphorylation. The PKC activators, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and bryostatin-1, induced rapid, stoichiometric hyperphosphorylation of CD34 protein in cells, resulting in a 5-fold increase in CD34 phosphorylation. In vitro kinase studies revealed that purified PKC could directly phosphorylate purified CD34. Only serine phosphorylation was detected in the CD34 molecule. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping experiments indicated that PKC induces the phosphorylation of identical serine residue(s) in vitro and in vivo (in KG1 cells). These are newly phosphorylated serine residue(s), which are not detectably phosphorylated in CD34 from exponentially growing KG1 cells. These data indicate that the developmental stage-specific molecule, CD34, is a phosphorylation target for activated PKC. Furthermore, these findings raise the possibility that PKC activation and phosphorylation of the CD34 molecule may play a role in signal transduction during early lymphohematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560508154,"The ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line C55.7 has normal amounts of ODC mRNA with very low amounts of immunologically detectable ODC protein, suggesting a structural mutation; however, 5-azacytidine treatment leads to phenotypical reversion (Steglich, C., and Scheffler, I. E. (1985) Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 11, 11-23). We have demonstrated by chemical cleavage a single base mismatch in DNA heteroduplexes composed of wild-type and mutant cDNA strands. DNA sequencing showed that the mutant phenotype results from an aspartate-glycine substitution at amino acid 381 of the protein. When 5-azacytidine-revertant cell lines were selected for resistance to alpha-difluoromethylornithine, the resulting amplified ODC gene was structurally indistinguishable from the wild type gene. These results suggested the existence of a single active ODC locus in CHO cells. Using the methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases AvaI and HpaII, we found evidence for two differentially methylated alleles in wild type, ODC-deficient and alpha-difluoromethylornithine-resistant cells. One of the alleles appeared completely inactivated by hypermethylation but could be reactivated by demethylation in spontaneous or 5-azacytidine-induced revertants."
https://openalex.org/W1613350759,"Vitronectin (serum spreading factor, complement S protein, epibolin) is a glycoprotein that mediates cell adhesion and interacts with components of the complement, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems. It circulates in plasma as a 75-kDa single chain polypeptide and as a two-chain form consisting of 65- and 10-kDa polypeptides linked by a disulfide bond. An individual may have a predominance of the single chain or the two-chain form inherited as a Mendelian trait or have approximately equal amounts of both forms. Inspection of published cDNA sequences suggests that either methionine or threonine can occur at position 381, which is adjacent to the presumed site of proteolytic cleavage (Arg379-Ala380) that gives rise to the two-chain form. We have determined the presence of the Met381 and/or Thr381 alleles of the vitronectin gene in 42 individuals by oligonucleotide hybridization to genomic DNA. To determine whether this polymorphism is correlated with the susceptibility to cleavage of the Arg379-Ala380 peptide bond in vivo, we have prepared immunoblots of plasma from the same group of individuals. Nineteen individuals homozygous for the Thr381 allele had 17 +/- 9% (mean +/- S.D.) single chain vitronectin in their plasma samples. Nine individuals homozygous for the Met381 allele had 66 +/- 4% single chain vitronectin. Fourteen heterozygous individuals had 38 +/- 13% single chain vitronectin. The differences in mean values were statistically significant (p less than 0.001). These results suggest that the presence of threonine rather than methionine at position 381 of vitronectin increases the susceptibility of the protein to cleavage of the Arg379-Ala380 peptide bond in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1532556961,"Reverse transcriptase required for the synthesis of msDNA.Ec67 in an Escherichia coli strain was purified as a large molecular weight complex with msDNA. The complex sedimented in a glycerol gradient at an s value greater than 19. The predominant protein species co-purifying with reverse transcriptase activity in the complex had a molecular weight estimated at 65,000 which is close to the expected size of 67,227 for the Ec67-reverse transcriptase. In addition, the large complex also contained msDNA.Ec67. The purified complex was able to synthesize cDNA using 5 S rRNA as a template (annealed to a synthetic DNA primer), and a double-stranded DNA using a synthetic DNA template (annealed to a synthetic DNA primer). When msDNA.Ec67 was used as a natural template:primer, the purified complex produced two major products: a 103-base single-stranded DNA by extending the 3' end of msDNA using msdRNA as a template, and a 60-base double-stranded DNA product resulting from the converse reaction in which the 3' end of msdRNA is extended using msDNA as a template. The results suggest that bacterial reverse transcriptase is capable of producing single-stranded cDNA and possibly double-stranded DNA as well. Possible implications of these findings on the biology of the msDNA-retron system are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1580289812,"We have characterized and analyzed IGF-I- and insulin-stimulated cell growth, receptor binding, and autophosphorylation in the human leukemic cell line HL-60. IGF-I-stimulated cell growth occurred at low (5 ng/ml) and insulin stimulated only at high (500 ng/ml) concentrations. Binding of 125I-IGF-I to partially purified plasma membrane proteins followed the characteristics of IGF-I receptor binding. 125I-IGF-I binding, as determined by chemical cross-linking, occurred to a 145-kDa protein. IGF-I, as well as insulin, stimulated the autophosphorylation of a 105-kDa band (pp105), but we could not detect a 95-kDa band corresponding to the known molecular mass of the IGF-I and insulin receptor beta-subunits. Phosphorylation of pp105 followed the dose-response characteristics of the IGF-I receptor. The phosphorylation of pp105 occurred at tyrosine and threonine, and the pattern of HPLC tryptic peptide maps showed marked differences when compared with that of a phosphorylated insulin receptor beta-subunit. Enzymatic deglycosylation of pp105 resulted only in a slight reduction of the molecular weight. These data suggest that pp105 is the beta-subunit of an IGF-I receptor variant with a higher molecular weight, similar to that found in fetal tissue. The HL-60 cell may acquire, at least in part, malignant growth characteristics through reexpression of the fetal version of the IGF-I receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1586800194,"Insulin-producing rat islet RIN-5AH tumor cells express multiple binding sites for human growth hormone (hGH). The effect of rat growth hormone (rGH), rat prolactin (rPRL), and human placental lactogen (hPL) on the binding of 125I-labeled hGH (125I-hGH) to RIN-5AH cells revealed the presence of both lactogen and somatogen receptor populations. Covalent cross-linking of 125I-hGH, 125I-rGH, and 125I-rPRL to the RIN cells identified a 115-kDa somatogen receptor protein that binds hGH and rGH but not rPRL and hPL, and a 95-kDa lactogen receptor protein that binds hGH, rPRL, and hPL but not rGH. Antiserum directed against the 37.5- and 40.7-kDa GH-binding proteins of mouse hepatic tissue specifically recognized the 115-kDa protein cross-linked with 125I-hGH, whereas a monoclonal antibody raised against the hepatic 42-kDa rPRL receptor recognized the 95-kDa protein cross-linked with 125I-hGH. Northern blot analysis of RNA from RIN-5AH cells using an rGH receptor-specific cDNA probe showed three transcripts of 5.8, 1.8, and 1.5 kilobases, respectively. Analysis with an rPRL receptor-specific cDNA probe revealed the presence of a predominant 3.5-kilobase transcript. We conclude that the insulin-producing cells express large forms of both the GH and PRL receptors which are structurally related to those of hepatic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1551209321,"Expression of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-alpha gene in placental trophoblasts is markedly stimulated by cAMP, a property preserved in a reporter plasmid containing its cAMP response elements (CREs) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase coding sequence (CRE alpha CAT). In search of a potential physiologic regulator of hCG gene expression via cAMP, we found that JEG-3 syncytial trophoblast cells have specific binding sites for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) with dissociation constant of 1 nM. VIP maximally increased the transient expression of CRE alpha CAT and the expression of endogenous hCG-alpha mRNA in JEG-3 cells by 4- and 9-fold, respectively. Exposure of JEG-3 cells to 30 nM VIP increased cAMP levels 60-fold after 10-30 min, but cAMP rapidly declined thereafter. As a consequence of this desensitization, the effect of VIP on stimulation of both CRE alpha CAT and endogenous hCG-alpha and hCG-beta mRNA levels more closely resembled that of forskolin or 8-br-cAMP at time points much less than 24 h. Moreover, transient exposure to 8-br-cAMP was much less effective than 24 h of continuous incubation on CRE alpha CAT activity. We conclude that VIP rapidly increases cAMP content and activates hCG-alpha gene expression in JEG-3 cells, but sustained elevations in cAMP are necessary for maximal accumulation of this CRE-regulated gene product."
https://openalex.org/W1506053100,"Friend erythroleukemic cells provide a system for studying the regulation of the expression of regulatory (R) and catalytic (C) subunit isoforms of cAMP-dependent protein kinases. Friend cells contain RI alpha, two RII subunits previously designated RII-52 and RII-54, and C alpha. When the cells are treated with 0.2 mM methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) and either 20 microM forskolin or 0.5 mM 8-Br-cAMP, RI alpha content declines 50-75% because of a large decrease in the t1/2 value for the dissociated RI alpha subunit; RII-54 expression is invariant, but the amount and rate of synthesis of RII-52 increases 10-15-fold (Schwartz, D. A., and Rubin, C. S. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6296-6303). We now demonstrate that RII-52 and RII-54 correspond to RII beta and RII alpha, respectively. When cAMP levels are elevated in Friend cells the abundance of the 3.3-kilobase RII beta mRNA increases 25-30-fold in parallel with the rate of RII beta subunit synthesis indicating that pretranslational control is operative. Other R and C mRNAs are not markedly induced. Surprisingly, the rate of transcriptional initiation of the RII beta gene and the stability of RII beta mRNA are not altered during RII beta induction. Rather, the induction of RII beta mRNA is associated with the accumulation of major (3.4 kilobases) and minor (4 kilobases) RII beta pre-mRNAs in the nucleus. It appears that the cAMP signal-transduction system alters a nuclear protein(s) such that either the proportion of RII beta pre-mRNAs that are processed to mature mRNAs and are exported to the cytoplasm is greatly increased or the nuclear precursors are stabilized. Thus, regulation is exerted at a posttranscriptional level. In order to establish directly a causal role for C in RII beta induction and to rule out artifacts introduced by the use of drugs such as forskolin, MIX, and cAMP analogs we stably transfected Friend cells with a vector containing C alpha cDNA under the regulation of the zinc-activated metallothionein I promoter. The addition of 0.15 mM ZnSO4 caused the accumulation of dissociated C subunits and the selective induction of RII beta."
https://openalex.org/W1533399996,"While a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) has been suggested to phosphorylate epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in vitro, both intrinsic and EGF- or potent phorbol tumor promoter-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptor were found to be depressed in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells by prior incubation of the cells with various protein kinase A activators (e.g. cholera toxin, forskolin, cAMP analogues, or a combination of prostaglandin E1 and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine). Protein kinase A activators did not change significantly either the number of EGF receptors or their affinity for EGF. The tryptic phosphopeptide map of EGF receptors from cells treated with cholera toxin alone or cholera toxin followed by EGF revealed unique peptides whose serine phosphorylation was preferentially depressed. However, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A phosphorylated no threonine and little serine in the EGF receptors in the plasma membranes of isolated A431 cells in vitro, while serine residues in an unidentified 170-kDa membrane protein(s) other than EGF receptor were heavily phosphorylated. Pretreatment of the cells with forskolin blocked 1,2-diacylglycerol induction by EGF; growth inhibition by nanomolar levels of EGF could be partially restored by the presence of forskolin. These results indicate that an increase in intracellular cAMP modulates the EGF receptor signal transduction system by reducing EGF-induced production of diacylglycerol without direct phosphorylation of EGF receptors by protein kinase A in A431 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1562814705,"A rapid two-step purification to homogeneity of the calmodulin-activated adenylyl cyclase from urea extracts of Bordetella pertussis organisms (strain 114) is described. Catalytic and invasive activities are purified 30- and 177-fold, respectively, and virtually no degraded forms are found. Specific activities are 0.4 mmol/min/mg and 0.5 mumol/mg of enzyme protein/mg of cell protein/min for catalytic and invasive activities, respectively. The 15 amino-terminal amino acids agree with those deduced from the DNA sequence, as does the molecular mass of 175 kDa (guanidine) or 177 kDa (urea) obtained by equilibrium sedimentation. The larger apparent molecular mass seen in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis can be ascribed to anomalous migration. Half-maximal cyclase activation occurs at 3-4 X 10(-10) M calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ and at 2 X 10(-8) M calmodulin in its absence. Ca2+ activation is maximal at 60-100 microM free CaCl2 (at low calmodulin concentrations), and free Ca2+ concentrations above approximately 125 microM are inhibitory at any calmodulin concentration. Extracellular Ca2+ is essential for intoxication. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, exogenous calmodulin does not inhibit penetration of the cyclase."

In spite of the structural stabilization brought about by HMG 14/17, the presence of these proteins causes little effect on the efficiency of the different nucleosomal particles as transcription templates for RNA polymerase II. The nucleosomal particles lacking one H2A.H2B dimer and containing two bound HMG 14/17 molecules are efficient in vitro transcription templates, which allow transcription of the whole length of the DNA present in the particle. These results are consistent with HMG 14/17 being present in active chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1523093647,"To study the activity of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor during EGF-directed internalization, liver epithelial cells were exposed to EGF at 37 degrees C for various periods of time, washed, and homogenized at 0 degrees C. EGF receptor autophosphorylation was assessed in homogenates using [gamma-32P]ATP. Autophosphorylation was stimulated 3- to 6-fold in homogenates of cells incubated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 15 min but was at or below basal levels in homogenates of cells treated with EGF for 2.5-5 min. This was surprising because immunoblotting revealed that EGF receptor phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr) content in intact cells was near maximal from 30 s to 5 min after EGF treatment. Excess EGF (1 microgram/ml), added after homogenization but prior to the assay, increased autophosphorylation in homogenates of cells that had not been treated with EGF, but failed to increase activity in homogenates of cells treated with EGF in culture for 2.5-5 min. Suppression of tyrosine phosphorylation of an exogenous kinase substrate was also observed at times paralleling the suppression of EGF receptor autophosphorylation. The transient suppression of receptor autophosphorylation in the cell-free assay was not explained by persistent occupation of autophosphorylation sites by phosphate added in the intact cells. The sites were greater than 80% dephosphorylated during the homogenization. Additionally phosphatase inhibition that prevented the normal loss of EGF receptor P-Tyr in intact cells at 15 min did not affect the pattern of early (2.5-5 min) suppression and later (15 min) stimulation of autophosphorylation measured in the cell-free assay. The suppression was not explained by activation of protein kinase C in that depletion of greater than 95% of cellular protein kinase C activity by an 18-h incubation of cells with 10 microM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) did not affect the early suppression of autophosphorylation in EGF-treated cells. Moreover, under the conditions tested, activation of protein kinase C by short-term treatment (0.5-10 min) with TPA or angiotensin II did not appreciably alter subsequent autophosphorylation in the cell-free assay. In contrast, a 30 degrees C preincubation of homogenates from cells with suppressed EGF receptor autophosphorylation led to the recovery of the ability of EGF to stimulate EGF receptor autophosphorylation. These results suggest that a rapid reversible protein kinase C-independent process prevents detection of EGF receptor kinase activity during an early phase of EGF-dependent receptor internalization."

https://openalex.org/W1656081390,"The RecA protein is indispensable for homologous genetic recombination in Escherichia coli. This protein alone promotes the ATP-dependent formation of homologous joint molecules and their processing in vitro. Through the use of a set of anti-RecA protein mouse monoclonal IgGs, we have been attempting to divide the whole process into elementary steps to determine the basic functions of the protein. In order to correlate the basic functions with the active sites on the recA polypeptide, we located the epitopes for the anti-RecA protein-IgGs on the recA polypeptide by means of immunoblotting experiments and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay involving isolated proteolytic polypeptides or synthetic ones derived from various regions of the recA polypeptide. The epitopes for anti-RecA protein-IgGs ARM321 and ARM414, both of which are shown to inhibit the DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and the formation of homologous joints by the RecA protein, were found to be located between Thr89 and Glu127 and between Glu233 and Lys256, respectively, on the RecA polypeptide. IgG ARM193 had been shown to interfere with the protein-protein interaction between two RecA protein molecules, and ARM191 had been suggested to inhibit the binding of double-stranded DNA to the RecA protein. The epitopes for ARM193 and ARM191 were found to be located in a approximately 90-amino acid region at the C terminus. These results suggest the locations of the active sites and a functional core on the RecA polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1543002660,"Synthetic mRNAs (i.e. cRNA alpha and cRNA beta) were obtained by cell-free transcription of M13 KS(+) (Bluescript) expression vectors which contained the entire coding region of the alpha or beta subunits of lamb kidney Na,K-ATPase. Translation in reticulocyte lysates of cRNA alpha yielded full length alpha polypeptide, as well as a limited array of immunoprecipitable lower molecular weight products. cRNA beta yielded a single immunoprecipitable full length polypeptide. Association of the alpha polypeptide with the microsomal membranes was obtained only co-translationally. Fifteen to 50% of the membrane-associated alpha subunit was resistant to extraction with alkali. The resistance of a 29-kDa fragment to trypsinolysis indicated that the alpha subunit was inserted into microsomal membranes. In the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes, the beta polypeptide was glycosylated as indicated by the appearance of three higher molecular weight polypeptides that were sensitive to endoglycosidase H and bound to Concanavalin A. The beta subunit was predominantly translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum since 90% of the mass of the membrane-associated beta polypeptide was resistant to trypsin (i.e. reduced in size from 40 kDa to 37.5 kDa), and 95% of all of the beta chains were resistant to extraction with alkali. Neither the alpha nor the beta subunits have NH2-terminal leader signal sequences, but both may require the signal recognition receptor for membrane insertion, as evidenced by inhibition of incorporation of both subunits into microsomes pretreated with N-ethylmaleimide. Simultaneous translation of cRNA alpha and cRNA beta did not enhance membrane insertion of either the alpha or beta polypeptide."
