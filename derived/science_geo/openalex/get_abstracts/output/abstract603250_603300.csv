https://openalex.org/W2783192416,"A global map of soil bacteria Soil bacteria play key roles in regulating terrestrial carbon dynamics, nutrient cycles, and plant productivity. However, the natural histories and distributions of these organisms remain largely undocumented. Delgado-Baquerizo et al. provide a survey of the dominant bacterial taxa found around the world. In soil collections from six continents, they found that only 2% of bacterial taxa account for nearly half of the soil bacterial communities across the globe. These dominant taxa could be clustered into ecological groups of co-occurring bacteria that share habitat preferences. The findings will allow for a more predictive understanding of soil bacterial diversity and distribution. Science , this issue p. 320"
https://openalex.org/W2782774915,"Tracking mitotic chromosome formation How cells pack DNA into fully compact, rod-shaped chromosomes during mitosis has fascinated cell biologists for more than a century. Gibcus et al. delineated the conformational transition trajectory from interphase chromatin to mitotic chromosomes minute by minute during the cell cycle. The mitotic chromosome is organized in a spiral staircase architecture in which chromatin loops emanate radially from a centrally located helical scaffold. The molecular machines condensin I and II play distinct roles in these processes: Condensin II is essential for helical winding, whereas condensin I modulates the organization within each helical turn.

However, the need for high beam doses, especially as a sample is rotated to find the crystal axes, can lead to damage, particularly in fragile materials. Zhang et al. combined a state-of-the-art direct-detection electron-counting camera with ways to limit the overall electron dose to analyze delicate materials such as metal organic frameworks. With this approach, they could see the benzene rings in a UiO-66 linker and the coexistence of ligand-free (metal-exposing) and ligand-capped surfaces in UiO-66 crystals. Science , this issue p. 675"

Kopperger et al. improved the precision of such machines by synthesizing a 25-nm-long arm defined by a DNA six-helix bundle connected to a 55 nm-by-55 nm DNA origami plate via flexible single-stranded scaffold crossovers (see the Perspective by Hogberg). When placed in a cross-shaped electrophoretic chamber, the arms could be driven at angular frequencies of up to 25 Hz and positioned to within 2.5 nm. The arm could be used to transport fluorophores and inorganic nanoparticles. Science , this issue p. 296 ; see also p. 279"
https://openalex.org/W2782731154,"Summary N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) affects multiple aspects of mRNA metabolism and regulates developmental transitions by promoting mRNA decay. Little is known about the role of m 6 A in the adult mammalian nervous system. Here we report that sciatic nerve lesion elevates levels of m 6 A-tagged transcripts encoding many regeneration-associated genes and protein translation machinery components in the adult mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Single-base resolution m 6 A-CLIP mapping further reveals a dynamic m 6 A landscape in the adult DRG upon injury. Loss of either m 6 A methyltransferase complex component Mettl14 or m 6 A-binding protein Ythdf1 globally attenuates injury-induced protein translation in adult DRGs and reduces functional axon regeneration in the peripheral nervous system in vivo . Furthermore, Pten deletion-induced axon regeneration of retinal ganglion neurons in the adult central nervous system is attenuated upon Mettl14 knockdown. Our study reveals a critical epitranscriptomic mechanism in promoting injury-induced protein synthesis and axon regeneration in the adult mammalian nervous system."

Lin et al. used DNA strands on gold nanoparticles to control interparticle distance. The DNA strands contained modified adenines with more rigid ribose groups that formed stronger base pairs. The height of the stacks of three different types of gold nanoparticle could be changed with different solvents, which in turn changed their optical response. Science , this issue p. 669"

Although chiral inorganic nanostructures can exhibit high circular dichroism, modulating this optical activity has usually required irreversible chemical changes. Yeom et al. synthesized paramagnetic cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) nanoparticles with l - and d -cysteine surface ligands. These ligands created chiral distortions of the crystal lattices, and this anisotropy led to much stronger chiroptical activity. The circular dichroism in the ultraviolet of nanoparticle gels could be modulated with magnetic fields of ∼1.5 tesla. Science , this issue p. 309"

https://openalex.org/W2784190408,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) enables cotranslational delivery of proteins for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but its full in vivo role remains incompletely explored. We combined rapid auxin-induced SRP degradation with proximity-specific ribosome profiling to define SRP's in vivo function in yeast. Despite the classic view that SRP recognizes amino-terminal signal sequences, we show that SRP was generally essential for targeting transmembrane domains regardless of their position relative to the amino terminus. By contrast, many proteins containing cleavable amino-terminal signal peptides were efficiently cotranslationally targeted in SRP's absence. We also reveal an unanticipated consequence of SRP loss: Transcripts normally targeted to the ER were mistargeted to mitochondria, leading to mitochondrial defects. These results elucidate SRP's essential roles in maintaining the efficiency and specificity of protein targeting."

Kitson et al. report a hybrid protocol that customizes a blueprint for synthesis of a target compound in a series of interconnected plastic modules, which can be assembled en masse by 3D printing (see the Perspective by Hornung). The approach, demonstrated for the commercial muscle relaxant baclofen, establishes a systematic workflow that is potentially amenable to automation: All that is necessary for synthesis and purification is the introduction of stock solutions and variation of temperature or pressure.

https://openalex.org/W2783952753,"The biogenesis of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Gram-negative bacteria requires the insertion of β-barrel proteins into the outer membranes. Homologous Omp85 proteins are essential for membrane insertion of β-barrel precursors. It is unknown if precursors are threaded through the Omp85-channel interior and exit laterally or if they are translocated into the membrane at the Omp85-lipid interface. We have mapped the interaction of a precursor in transit with the mitochondrial Omp85-channel Sam50 in the native membrane environment. The precursor is translocated into the channel interior, interacts with an internal loop, and inserts into the lateral gate by β-signal exchange. Transport through the Omp85-channel interior followed by release through the lateral gate into the lipid phase may represent a basic mechanism for membrane insertion of β-barrel proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2695501819,"Preservation of a balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition is critical for normal brain function. A number of homeostatic cellular mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in maintaining this balance, including long-term plasticity of GABAergic inhibitory synapses. Many previous studies have demonstrated a coupling of postsynaptic spiking with modification of perisomatic inhibition. Here, we demonstrate that activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors leads to input-specific long-term potentiation of dendritic inhibition mediated by somatostatin-expressing interneurons. This form of plasticity is expressed postsynaptically and requires both CaMKIIα and the β2 subunit of the GABA-A receptor. Importantly, this process may function to preserve dendritic inhibition, as genetic deletion of NMDAR signaling results in a selective weakening of dendritic inhibition. Overall, our results reveal a new mechanism for linking excitatory and inhibitory input in neuronal dendrites and provide novel insight into the homeostatic regulation of synaptic transmission in cortical circuits."

Du et al. developed a method to systematically ablate IFN evasion genes from live, attenuated influenza virus (see the Perspective by Teijaro and Burton). A combination of mutants was assembled to construct a virus that triggered transient IFN responses in mice but that was unable to replicate effectively. The transient IFN responses led to robust antibody and memory responses that protected against subsequent challenge with different influenza viruses. This approach could be adapted to improve other RNA virus vaccines. Science , this issue p. 290 ; see also p. 277"
https://openalex.org/W2793350940,"Cdk5, which plays a role in the development and progression of many human cancers, localizes in the mitochondria, a key determinant of apoptotic cell death. Cdk5 is upregulated in breast cancer cells but it was shown that Cdk5 loss increases chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism by which Cdk5 loss promotes cell death remains unclear. Here, we investigate the possibility that Cdk5 loss activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that Cdk5-deficient breast cancer cells exhibit increased mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial ROS levels, and mitochondrial fragmentation that is associated with an increase in both intracellular Ca2+ level and calcineurin activity, and DRP1 S637 dephosphorylation. These events accompany increased apoptosis, indicating that Cdk5 loss promotes mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. To define this apoptotic pathway, we utilized various inhibitors of mitochondrial function. Apoptosis is completely prevented by mPTP inhibition, almost fully inhibited by blocking ROS and unaffected by inhibition of mitochondrial fission, suggesting that apoptosis in breast cancer cells due to Cdk5 loss occurs via a novel mPTP-dependent mechanism that acts primarily through ROS increase."
https://openalex.org/W2789555012,"The objectives of this cross-sectional study were: 1) to estimate the prevalence and characterize the severity of periodontal disease in a population of dogs housed in commercial breeding facilities; 2) to characterize PD preventive care utilized by facility owners; and 3) to assess inter-rater reliability of a visual scoring assessment tool. Adult dogs (N = 445) representing 42 breeds at 24 CB facilities in Indiana and Illinois were assessed. Periodontal disease was scored visually using the American Veterinary Dental Collage 0-IV scale. Inter-rater reliability was assessed on 198 dogs and facility owners were asked to provide information about the preventive care utilized. The overall prevalence of periodontal disease (Grades I-IV) was 86.3% (95% CI: 82.9, 89.3). An ordered logistic regression analysis found age (OR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.24, 1.54; P<0.0001), facility (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.09, 1.18; P<0.0001), sex (OR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.12, 2.65; P = 0.013), and non-professional dental scaling (OR = 2.82; 95% CI 1.34, 5.91; P = 0.006) to be statistically significant. Inter-rater reliability analysis found agreement to be 86.2%, with a weighted kappa of 0.4731 (95% CI 0.3847, 0.5615) indicating moderate agreement. Risk of periodontal disease increased with increasing age. Additionally, a trend toward decreasing risk with increasing weight was also found, although it was not statistically significant. The trends identified agree with studies that have evaluated periodontal disease in the companion dog population and do not support the assumption that the dental health of dogs in commercial breeding facilities is worse than that of the population as a whole. Although there were few cases of severe periodontal disease and all facilities employed some type of preventive care in this sample, the large number of dogs with some degree of disease (Grades I-IV) suggests that further investigation of preventive care is warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2789706518,"TP53 mutations frequently occur in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients without human papillomavirus infection. The recurrence rate for these patients is distinctly high. It has been actively explored to identify agents that target TP53 mutations and restore wild-type (WT) TP53 activities in HNSCC. PRIMA-1 (p53-reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis-1) and its methylated analogue PRIMA-1Met (also called APR-246) were found to be able to reestablish the DNA-binding activity of p53 mutants and reinstate the functions of WT p53. Herein we report that piperlongumine (PL), an alkaloid isolated from Piper longum L., synergizes with APR-246 to selectively induce apoptosis and autophagic cell death in HNSCC cells, whereas primary and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts and spontaneously immortalized non-tumorigenic human skin keratinocytes (HaCat) are spared from the damage by the co-treatment. Interestingly, PL-sensitized HNSCC cells to APR-246 are TP53 mutation-independent. Instead, we demonstrated that glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), a GST family member that catalyzes the conjugation of GSH with electrophilic compounds to fulfill its detoxification function, is highly expressed in HNSCC tissues. Administration of PL and APR-246 significantly suppresses GSTP1 activity, resulting in the accumulation of ROS, depletion of GSH, elevation of GSSG, and DNA damage. Ectopic expression of GSTP1 or pre-treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) abrogates the ROS elevation and decreases DNA damage, apoptosis, and autophagic cell death prompted by PL/APR-246. In addition, administration of PL and APR-246 impedes UMSCC10A xenograft tumor growth in SCID mice. Taken together, our data suggest that HNSCC cells are selectively sensitive to the combination of PL and APR-246 due to a remarkably synergistic effect of the co-treatment in the induction of ROS by suppression of GSTP1."
https://openalex.org/W2782853604,"The mesenchymal gene program has been shown to promote the metastatic progression of ovarian cancer; however, specific proteins induced by this program that lead to these metastatic behaviors have not been identified. Using patient derived tumor cells and established human ovarian tumor cell lines, we find that the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition inducing factor TWIST1 drives expression of discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that recognizes fibrillar collagen as ligand. The expression and action of DDR2 was critical for mesothelial cell clearance, invasion and migration in ovarian tumor cells. It does so, in part, by upregulating expression and activity of matrix remodeling enzymes that lead to increased cleavage of fibronectin and spreading of tumor cells. Additionally, DDR2 stabilizes SNAIL1, allowing for sustained mesenchymal phenotype. In patient derived ovarian cancer specimens, DDR2 expression correlated with enhanced invasiveness. DDR2 expression was associated with advanced stage ovarian tumors and metastases. In vivo studies demonstrated that the presence of DDR2 is critical for ovarian cancer metastasis. These findings indicate that the collagen receptor DDR2 is critical for multiple steps of ovarian cancer progression to metastasis, and thus, identifies DDR2 as a potential new target for the treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2792971003,"Compressed sensing (CS) reconstructions of under-sampled measurements generate missing data based on assumptions of image sparsity. Non-contrast time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) is a good candidate for CS based acceleration, as MRA images feature bright trees of sparse vessels over a well-suppressed anatomical background signal. A short scan time derived from CS is beneficial for patients of moyamoya disease (MMD) because of the frequency of MR scans. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of TOF-MRA with CS in the evaluation of MMD. Twenty-two patients were examined using TOF-MRA with CS (CS-TOF) and parallel imaging (PI-TOF). The acceleration factors were 3 (CS3) and 5 (CS5) for CS-TOF, and 3 (PI3) for PI-TOF. Two neuroradiologists evaluated the MMD grading according to stenosis/occlusion scores using the modified Houkin’s system, and the visibility of moyamoya vessels (MMVs) using a 3-point scale. Concordance was calculated with Cohen’s κ. The numbers of MMVs in the basal ganglia were compared using Bland-Altman analysis and Wilcoxon’s signed-rank tests. MRA scan times were 4:07, 3:53, and 2:42 for PI3, CS3, and CS5, respectively. CS-reconstruction completed within 10 minutes. MMD grading and MMV visibility scales showed excellent correlation (κ > .966). Although the number of MMVs was significantly higher in CS3 than in PI3 (p < .0001) and CS5 (p < .0001), Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement between PI3, CS3, and CS5. Compressed sensing can accelerate TOF-MRA with improved visualization of small collaterals in equivalent time (CS3) or equivalent results in a shorter scan time (CS5)."

We previously reported that, in metazoans and fission yeast, Rif1 also plays pivotal roles in controlling genome-wide DNA replication timing. We proposed that Rif1 may assemble chromatin compartments that contain specific replication-timing domains by promoting chromatin loop formation. Rif1 also is involved in DNA lesion repair, restart after replication fork collapse, anti-apoptosis activities, replicative senescence, and transcriptional regulation. Although multiple physiological functions of Rif1 have been characterized, biochemical and structural information on mammalian Rif1 is limited, mainly because of difficulties in purifying the full-length protein. Here, we expressed and purified the 2418-amino-acid-long, full-length murine Rif1 as well as its partially truncated variants in human 293T cells. Hydrodynamic analyses indicated that Rif1 forms elongated or extended homo-oligomers in solution, consistent with the presence of a HEAT-type helical repeat segment known to adopt an elongated shape. We also observed that the purified murine Rif1 bound G-quadruplex (G4) DNA with high specificity and affinity, as was previously shown for Rif1 from fission yeast. Both the N-terminal (HEAT-repeat) and C-terminal segments were involved in oligomer formation and specifically bound G4 DNA, and the central intrinsically disordered polypeptide segment increased the affinity for G4. Of note, pulldown assays revealed that Rif1 simultaneously binds multiple G4 molecules.

However, compared with other cancer drivers, the exploitation of GPCRs as potential therapeutic targets has been largely ignored, despite the fact that GPCRs are highly druggable. Therefore, to advance the potential status of GPCRs as therapeutic targets, it is important to understand how GPCRs function together with other cancer drivers during tumor progression. We now report that the α-arrestin domain–containing protein-3 (ARRDC3) acts as a tumor suppressor in part by controlling signaling and trafficking of the GPCR, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1). In a series of highly invasive basal-like breast carcinomas, we found that expression of ARRDC3 is suppressed whereas PAR1 is aberrantly overexpressed because of defective lysosomal sorting that results in persistent signaling. Using a lentiviral doxycycline-inducible system, we demonstrate that re-expression of ARRDC3 in invasive breast carcinoma is sufficient to restore normal PAR1 trafficking through the ALG-interacting protein X (ALIX)-dependent lysosomal degradative pathway. We also show that ARRDC3 re-expression attenuates PAR1-stimulated persistent signaling of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in invasive breast cancer. Remarkably, restoration of ARRDC3 expression significantly reduced activated PAR1-induced breast carcinoma invasion, which was also dependent on JNK signaling.

Mitochondrial genetic modifiers are proposed to influence the phenotypic expression of m.1555A→G mutation. Here, we report that a deafness-susceptibility allele (m.4317A→G) in the tRNAIle gene modulates the phenotype expression of m.1555A→G mutation. Strikingly, a large Han Chinese pedigree carrying both m.4317A→G and m.1555A→G mutations exhibited much higher penetrance of deafness than those carrying only the m.1555A→G mutation. The m.4317A→G mutation affected a highly conserved adenine at position 59 in the T-loop of tRNAIle. We therefore hypothesized that the m.4317A→G mutation alters both structure and function of tRNAIle. Using lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from members of Chinese families (three carrying both m.1555A→G and m.4317A→G mutations, three harboring only m.1555A→G mutation, and three controls lacking these mutations), we found that the cell lines bearing both m.4317A→G and m.1555A→G mutations exhibited more severe mitochondrial dysfunctions than those carrying only the m.1555A→G mutation. We also found that the m.4317A→G mutation perturbed the conformation, stability, and aminoacylation efficiency of tRNAIle.

Furthermore, mutant cell lines bearing both m.4317A→G and m.1555A→G mutations exhibited greater reductions in the mitochondrial ATP levels and membrane potentials and increasing production of reactive oxygen species than those carrying only the m.1555A→G mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2785134819,"Secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) are potent components of mammalian innate-immunity antibacterial mechanisms. sPLA2 enzymes attack bacteria by hydrolyzing bacterial membrane phospholipids, causing membrane disorganization and cell lysis. However, most Gram-negative bacteria are naturally resistant to sPLA2. Here we report a novel resistance mechanism to mammalian sPLA2 in Escherichia coli, mediated by a phospholipid repair system consisting of the lysophospholipid transporter LplT and the acyltransferase Aas in the cytoplasmic membrane. Mutation of the lplT or aas gene abolished bacterial lysophospholipid acylation activity and drastically increased bacterial susceptibility to the combined actions of inflammatory fluid components and sPLA2, resulting in bulk phospholipid degradation and loss of colony-forming ability. sPLA2-mediated hydrolysis of the three major bacterial phospholipids exhibited distinctive kinetics and deacylation of cardiolipin to its monoacyl-derivative closely paralleled bacterial death. Characterization of the membrane envelope in lplT- or aas-knockout mutant bacteria revealed reduced membrane packing and disruption of lipid asymmetry with more phosphatidylethanolamine present in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Moreover, modest accumulation of lysophospholipids in these mutant bacteria destabilized the inner membrane and rendered outer membrane–depleted spheroplasts much more sensitive to sPLA2. These findings indicated that LplT/Aas inactivation perturbs both the outer and inner membranes by bypassing bacterial membrane maintenance mechanisms to trigger specific interfacial activation of sPLA2. We conclude that the LplT/Aas system is important for maintaining the integrity of the membrane envelope in Gram-negative bacteria.

The OM of Gram-negative bacteria is arranged with an asymmetric lipid distribution: phospholipids (mainly phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) comprise the inner leaflet of the membrane, whereas the outer leaflet contains the complex glycolipid lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The restriction of OM PLs to the inner leaflet of the OM precludes, under normal conditions, access of an extracellular sPLA2 to the bacterial PL. The neutrophil-derived bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) and MAC facilitate sPLA2 attack by disrupting the LPS-rich outer leaflet of the OM (1Elsbach P. Weiss J. Levy O.

However, even under these conditions, the bactericidal potency of sPLA2 toward many Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis) is still limited, requiring doses of sPLA2 often beyond their physiological concentrations (1Elsbach P.

Thus, this intrinsic resistance may help Gram-negative pathogens survive host antibacterial mechanisms and also limits potential therapeutic application of sPLA2 toward Gram-negative bacteria-mediated infections. Of note, Gram-negative bacteria uniquely contain a PL repair system comprised of two inner membrane (IM)-associated proteins: LPL transporter (LplT) and acyltransferase-acyl carrier protein synthetase (Aas) (22Harvat E.M.

LplT promotes energy-independent transbilayer migration of each of the major LPL metabolites in Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lyso-phosphatidylglycerol (LPG), and lyso-cardiolipin) from the periplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the IM (23Lin Y.

To test this hypothesis, we used E. coli as a model to explore the role of LplT/Aas in the resistance of intact Gram-negative bacteria to mammalian sPLA2. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable role for cytoplasmic membrane LplT/Aas in protecting E. coli intact bacteria from the attack of sPLA2. Unexpectedly, our data indicated that the resistance mediated by LplT/Aas is not attributed to any direct repairing of sPLA2-generated LPLs. Instead, LplT and Aas cooperatively function to maintain the ability of both the OM and IM to act as structural barriers to initial interfacial activation of sPLA2. The conservation of the lplT/aas loci in many Gram-negative bacteria, including those pathogenic species listed above, raises the possibility of a conserved mechanism of resistance in Gram-negative microorganisms. This study provides the first evidence of a physiological role of LplT/Aas in bacterial defense and suggests new strategies for rendering Gram-negative bacterial pathogens more sensitive to host antimicrobial activities. In prokaryotes, functionally related genes are often co-transcribed in one bicistronic operon. The genes aas and lplT are adjacently located in their own operon in the genomes of E. coli and many other Gram-negative bacterial species (22Harvat E.M. Zhang Y.M. Tran C.V. Zhang Z. Frank M.W.

To avoid any genetic variation, our current study was performed in the background of a standard E. coli W3110 strain. Two single gene knockout strains, ΔlplT and Δaas, were generated using the λ-Red recombination approach (Fig. S1a and Table S1). Deletion of these genes did not affect bacterial growth in LB broth (Fig. S1b). Their loss of LPL acylation (ΔlplT and Δaas) activity or LPL transport (ΔlplT) was confirmed using the spheroplast-based [32P] LPE acylation and transport assays (Fig. 1, b and c, and Fig. S2a). The functional coupling of LplT and Aas was further demonstrated by treating ΔlplT spheroplasts with 1% Triton X-100 detergent (Fig. 1b and Fig. S2b).

Exposure of E. coli to host non-enzymatic antibacterial proteins producing alterations of the OM (e.g. BPI, MAC) increases bacterial sensitivity to mammalian sPLA2, including sPLA2-IB (“pancreatic”). To test the possible role of LplT and/or Aas on the sensitivity of E. coli to sPLA2, we incubated E. coli WT, ΔlplT, and Δaas strains with purified porcine pancreatic sPLA2 (referred to as psPLA2) and/or a previously characterized rabbit inflammatory (ascitic) fluid (AF) that contains BPI, several other rabbit granulocyte-derived cationic antimicrobial peptides and proteins, and each of the components of the complement system needed to form MAC (6Madsen L.M.

Under the conditions tested, WT E. coli was resistant to AF and/or psPLA2, as judged by colony-forming units (CFUs) (Fig. 2a). In sharp contrast, both ΔlplT and Δaas strains exhibited much greater sensitivity to combined treatment with AF + psPLA2 (>95% of the mutant cells killed within 1 h) (Fig. 2a). The greater sensitivity of the mutant strains was also manifest kinetically, with nearly all of the mutant bacteria killed within 2 h, with a half-time of ∼30 min (Fig. 2b). Maximal killing of the mutant strains required the combined and dose-dependent presence of both AF and psPLA2 (Fig. 2, a, c, and d) and the presence in AF of cationic antimicrobial proteins (e.g. BPI) (Fig. 2a). Virtually identical results were obtained using three different AF (Fig. S3), including one collected from a complement (C)6-deficient rabbit that is unable to form the membrane attack complex of complement (C5b-8)9n (6Madsen L.M. Inada M. Weiss J. Determinants of activation by complement of group II phospholipase A2 acting against Escherichia coli.Infect. Immun. 1996; 64 (8698462): 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that both ΔlplT and Δaas cells in lag, logarithmic growth or stationary phase were highly prone to treatment with AF + psPLA2 and their sensitivities were indistinguishable, whereas the resistance of WT was apparent at each phase of growth (Fig. S4). We also tested a E. coli double knockout strain Δaas/lplT in which the entire aas/lplT locus was deleted in the genome (Fig. S1). The increased sensitivity of the ΔlplT, Δaas, and Δaas/lplT strains was nearly identical in all tested conditions (Fig. 2, b–d). These data strongly suggest that the susceptibility of E. coli to psPLA2 in the presence of AF can be significantly enhanced by disrupting either the lplT or aas gene and thus imply an essential role of LplT/Aas in protecting the bacterium from sPLA2 attack. We next asked whether the increased susceptibility of ΔlplT and Δaas strains is caused by their loss of LPL acylation activity or by the gene deletions per se, given the fact that the membrane proteins LplT and Aas are also structural components of"
https://openalex.org/W2793486543,"The linearization of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) facilitates tumor cell growth and metastasis. However, the mechanism by which the ECM is remodeled is not fully understood. Hic-5 (TGFβ1i1), a focal adhesion scaffold protein, has previously been reported to be crucial for stromal ECM deposition and remodeling in vivo. Herein we show that CAFs lacking Hic-5 exhibit a significant reduction in the ability to form fibrillar adhesions, a specialized form of focal adhesion that promote fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Hic-5 was found to promote fibrillar adhesion formation through a newly characterized interaction with tensin1. Furthermore, Src-dependent phosphorylation of Hic-5 facilitated the interaction with tensin1 to prevent β1 integrin internalization and trafficking to the lysosome. The interaction between Hic-5 and tensin1 was mechanosensitive, promoting fibrillar adhesion formation and fibronectin fibrillogenesis in a rigidity-dependent fashion. Importantly, this Src-dependent mechanism was conserved in three-dimensional (3D) ECM environments. Immunohistochemistry of tensin1 showed enrichment in CAFs in vivo, which was abrogated upon deletion of Hic-5. Interestingly, elevated Hic-5 expression correlates with reduced distant metastasis-free survival in patients with basal-like, HER2+ and grade 3 tumors. Thus, we have identified Hic-5 as a crucial regulator of ECM remodeling in CAFs by promoting fibrillar adhesion formation through a novel interaction with tensin1."
https://openalex.org/W2788650673,"In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) model which can be used to predict the compressive strength of mortars exposed to sulfate attack was established. An accelerated corrosion test was applied to collect compressive strength data. For predicting the compressive strength of mortars, a total of 638 data samples obtained from experiment was chosen as a dataset to establish a SVM model. The values of the coefficient of determination, the mean absolute error, the mean absolute percentage error and the root mean square error were used for evaluating the predictive accuracy. The main factors affecting the predicted compressive strength were obtained by sensitivity analysis. A SVM model was calibrated, validated, and finally established. Moreover, the performance of the SVM model was compared to an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Results show that the prediction values from the SVM model were close to the experimental values; the main factors sensitive to concrete compressive strength were exposure time, water-cement ratio and sulfate ions; the performance of the SVM model was better than the ANN model. The SVM model developed in this study can be potentially used for predicting the compressive strength of cement-based materials servicing in harsh environments."
https://openalex.org/W2952306866,"This work describes the set up of a small scale fermentation methodology for measuring quantitative traits of hundreds of samples in an enological context. By using standardized screw cap vessels, the alcoholic fermentation kinetics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were measured by following their weight loss over the time. This dispositive was coupled with robotized enzymatic assays for measuring metabolites of enological interest in natural grape juices. Despite the small volume used, kinetic parameters and fermentation end products measured are similar with those observed in larger scale vats. The vessel used also offers the possibility to assay 32 volatiles compounds using a headspace solid-phase micro-extraction coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The vessel shaking applied strongly impacted most of the phenotypes investigated due to oxygen transfer occuring in the first hours of the alcoholic fermentation. The impact of grape must and micro-oxygenation was investigated illustrating some relevant genetic x environmental interactions. By phenotyping a wide panel of commercial wine starters in five grape juices, broad phenotypic correlations between kinetics and metabolic end products were evidentiated. Moreover, a multivariate analysis illustrates that some grape musts are more able than others to discriminate commercial strains since some are less robust to environmental changes."

https://openalex.org/W2784837647,"Species flower production and flowering phenology vary from year to year due to extrinsic factors. Inter-annual variability in flowering patterns may have important consequences for attractiveness to pollinators, and ultimately, plant reproductive output. To understand the consequences of flowering pattern variability, a community approach is necessary because pollinator flower choice is highly dependent on flower context. Our objectives were: 1) To quantify yearly variability in flower density and phenology; 2) To evaluate whether changes in flowering patterns result in significant changes in pollen/nectar composition. We monitored weekly flowering patterns in a Mediterranean scrubland community (23 species) over 8 years. Floral resource availability was estimated based on field measures of pollen and nectar production per flower. We analysed inter-annual variation in flowering phenology (duration and date of peak bloom) and flower production, and inter-annual and monthly variability in flower, pollen and nectar species composition. We also investigated potential phylogenetic effects on inter-annual variability of flowering patterns. We found dramatic variation in yearly flower production both at the species and community levels. There was also substantial variation in flowering phenology. Importantly, yearly fluctuations were far from synchronous across species, and resulted in significant changes in floral resources availability and composition at the community level. Changes were especially pronounced late in the season, at a time when flowers are scarce and pollinator visitation rates are particularly high. We discuss the consequences of our findings for pollinator visitation and plant reproductive success in the current scenario of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2951599149,"Wolbachia is a widespread, intracellular symbiont of arthropods, able to induce reproductive distortions and antiviral protection in insects. Wolbachia can also be pathogenic, as is the case with wMelPop, a virulent variant of the endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. An extensive genomic amplification of the 20kb region encompassing eight Wolbachia genes, called Octomom, is responsible for wMelPop virulence. The Octomom copy number in wMelPop can be highly variable between individual D. melanogaster flies, even when comparing siblings arising from a single female. Moreover, Octomom copy number can change rapidly between generations. These data suggest an intra-host variability in Octomom copy number between Wolbachia cells. Since wMelPop Wolbachia with different Octomom copy numbers grow at different rates, we hypothesized that selection could act on this intra-host variability. Here we tested if total Octomom copy number changes during the lifespan of individual Drosophila hosts, revealing selection for different Wolbachia populations. We performed a time course analysis of Octomom amplification in flies whose mothers were controlled for Octomom copy number. We show that despite the Octomom copy number being relatively stable it increases slightly throughout D. melanogaster adult life. This indicates that there is selection acting on the intra-host variation in the Octomom copy number over the lifespan of individual hosts. This within host selection for faster replicating bacterial symbionts may be in conflict with between host selection against highly pathogenic Wolbachia."
https://openalex.org/W2793769796,"Rumour is an old social phenomenon used in politics and other public spaces. It has been studied for only hundred years by sociologists and psychologists by qualitative means. Social media platforms open new opportunities to improve quantitative analyses. We scanned all scientific literature to find relevant features. We made a quantitative screening of some specific rumours (in French and in English). Firstly, we identified some sources of information to find them. Secondly, we compiled different reference, rumouring and event datasets. Thirdly, we considered two facets of a rumour: the way it can spread to other users, and the syntagmatic content that may or may not be specific for a rumour. We found 53 features, clustered into six categories, which are able to describe a rumour message. The spread of a rumour is multi-harmonic having different frequencies and spikes, and can survive several years. Combinations of words (n-grams and skip-grams) are not typical of expressivity between rumours and news but study of lexical transition from a time period to the next goes in the sense of transmission pattern as described by Allport theory of transmission. A rumour can be interpreted as a speech act but with transmission patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2789788869,"Latent transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-binding proteins (LTBPs) are important for the secretion, activation, and function of mature TGFβ, especially so in cancer cell physiology. However, specific roles of the LTBPs remain understudied in the context of the primary tumor microenvironment. Herein, we investigated the role of LTBP3 in the distinct processes involved in cancer metastasis. By using three human tumor cell lines of different tissue origin (epidermoid HEp-3 and prostate PC-3 carcinomas and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma) and several metastasis models conducted in both mammalian and avian settings, we show that LTBP3 is involved in the early dissemination of primary cancer cells, namely in the intravasation step of the metastatic cascade. Knockdown of LTBP3 in all tested cell lines led to significant inhibition of tumor cell intravasation, but did not affect primary tumor growth. LTBP3 was dispensable in the late steps of carcinoma cell metastasis that follow tumor cell intravasation, including vascular arrest, extravasation, and tissue colonization. However, LTBP3 depletion diminished the angiogenesis-inducing potential of HEp-3 cells in vivo, which was restorable by exogenous delivery of LTBP3 protein. A similar compensatory approach rescued the dampened intravasation of LTBP3-deficient HEp-3 cells, suggesting that LTBP3 regulates the induction of the intravasation-supporting angiogenic vasculature within developing primary tumors. Using our recently developed microtumor model, we confirmed that LTBP3 loss resulted in the development of intratumoral vessels with an abnormal microarchitecture incompatible with efficient intravasation of HEp-3 carcinoma cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LTBP3 represents a novel oncotarget that has distinctive functions in the regulation of angiogenesis-dependent tumor cell intravasation, a critical process during early cancer dissemination. Our experimental data are also consistent with the survival prognostic value of LTBP3 expression in early-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, further indicating a specific role for LTBP3 in cancer progression toward metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2794137870,"Fusobacterium necrophorum (Fn), a gram-negative anaerobe, is increasingly implicated as an etiologic agent in older adolescents and young adults with sore throat. Inadequately treated Fn pharyngitis may result in suppurative complications such as peritonsillar abscess and Lemierre’s syndrome. Data from the literature suggest that the incidence of life-threating complications in these age groups from Fn pharyngitis (Lemierre’s syndrome) in the United States exceeds those associated with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis (acute rheumatic fever). Using real-time PCR, we previously reported about a 10% prevalence of Fn in asymptomatic medical students and about 20% in students complaining of sore throat at a university student health clinic (p = 0.009). In this study, a comprehensive microbiome analysis of the same study samples confirms that Fn pharyngitis was more common than GAS pharyngitis. Eighteen patients were found to have Fn OTU values exceeding an arbitrary cutoff value of 0.1, i.e. greater than 10% of total sequences, with five subjects reaching values above 0.7. By contrast only 9 patients had GAS OTU values greater than 0.1 and none exceeded 0.6. When the data were analyzed using five separate assessments of alpha diversity, in each case for Fn there were statistically significant differences between Fn positive_high (OTU abundance > 0.1) vs control, Fn positive_high vs Fn negative (OTU abundance = 0), Fn positive_high vs Fn positive_low (OTU abundance > 0 and < 0.1). When the data were analyzed using three beta diversity indexes (Bray-Curtis, weighted unifrac, and unweighted unifrac), there were statistically significant differences between Fn positive_high (OTU abundance ≥ 0.1) vs control for all three. Statistically significant differences remained if we chose somewhat different OTU abundance cutoffs of 0.05 or 0.15. We conclude that Fn appears to play a dominant role in bacterial pharyngitis in the older adolescent and young adult age groups and that the development of a productive mucosal infection with Fn is linked to a significant decrease in the diversity of the associated tonsillar microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2792296531,"Although bilateral cochlear implant users receive input to both ears, they nonetheless have relatively poor localization abilities in the horizontal plane. This is likely because of the two binaural cues, they have good sensitivity to interaural differences of level (inter-aural level differences, or ILDs), but not those of time (inter-aural time differences; ITDs). Here, localization performance is assessed in six bilateral cochlear implant patients when instantaneous ITDs are measured and converted to ILDs, a strategy that results in larger-than-typical ILDs. The added ILDs are corrective, in that they are derived from individual listener performance across both frequency and azimuth, so that they are small where a listener performs well, and increase as performance deviates from ideal. Results show significantly improved localization performance as a result of this strategy, with two of the six listeners achieving levels of performance typically observed in NH listeners."

The current study aimed to investigate effects of miR-17 mimics or inhibitor on the viability and migration of rat glioma C6 cells, and explore possible mechanisms.The expression of miR-17 in rat glioma C6 cells and normal brain tissue was detected by quantitative PCR. Protein expression of Cyclin D1 in rat glioma C6 cells and normal brain tissue was measured by Western Blot. Glioma C6 cells were transfected with MiR-17 mimics or inhibitor. Cells that were not transfected (Lipofectamine only) and cells that were transfected with nonsense RNA negative control served as control. MTT assay was utilized to detect cell viability, and cell wound scratch assay was utilized to examine the migration index. In addition, protein expression of Cyclin D1, p-Akt and Akt in MiR-17 mimics or inhibitor-transfected glioma C6 cells was detected by Western Blot. This study had been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed.The expression of miR-17 was significantly lower, whereas the expression of Cyclin D1 was significantly higher in glioma C6 cells compared to normal brain tissue. MiR-17 mimics decreased the viability and migration of glioma C6 cells markedly at 48 h. In addition, MiR-17 inhibitor increased the viability and migration of glioma C6 cells at 24 and 48 h. The protein expression of Cyclin D1, p-Akt and Akt in glioma C6 cells decreased after transfection with miR-17 mimics for 72 h, and increased after transfection with miR-17 inhibitor for 72 h.The reduced miR-17 levels in glioma cells increased cell viability and migration, which correlates with increased expression of Cyclin D1, p-Akt and Akt."
https://openalex.org/W2793046117,"Designing an efficient association rule mining (ARM) algorithm for multilevel knowledge-based transactional databases that is appropriate for real-world deployments is of paramount concern. However, dynamic decision making that needs to modify the threshold either to minimize or maximize the output knowledge certainly necessitates the extant state-of-the-art algorithms to rescan the entire database. Subsequently, the process incurs heavy computation cost and is not feasible for real-time applications. The paper addresses efficiently the problem of threshold dynamic updation for a given purpose. The paper contributes by presenting a novel ARM approach that creates an intermediate itemset and applies a threshold to extract categorical frequent itemsets with diverse threshold values. Thus, improving the overall efficiency as we no longer needs to scan the whole database. After the entire itemset is built, we are able to obtain real support without the need of rebuilding the itemset (e.g. Itemset list is intersected to obtain the actual support). Moreover, the algorithm supports to extract many frequent itemsets according to a pre-determined minimum support with an independent purpose. Additionally, the experimental results of our proposed approach demonstrate the capability to be deployed in any mining system in a fully parallel mode; consequently, increasing the efficiency of the real-time association rules discovery process. The proposed approach outperforms the extant state-of-the-art and shows promising results that reduce computation cost, increase accuracy, and produce all possible itemsets."
https://openalex.org/W2789442591,"Background Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious and widespread viral infection of small ruminants (goats and sheep), causing heavy economic losses in many developing countries. Therefore, its progressive control and global eradication by 2030 was defined as a priority by international organizations addressing animal health. The control phase of the global strategy is based on mass vaccination of small ruminant populations in endemic regions or countries. It is estimated that a 70% post-vaccination immunity rate (PVIR) is needed in a given epidemiological unit to prevent PPR virus spread. However, implementing mass vaccination is difficult and costly in smallholder farming systems with scattered livestock and limited facilities. Regarding this, controlling PPR is a special challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we focused on this region to assess the effect of several variables of PVIR in two contrasted smallholder farming systems. Methods Using a seasonal matrix population model of PVIR, we estimated its decay in goats reared in sub-humid areas, and sheep reared in semi-arid areas, over a 4-year vaccination program. Assuming immunologically naive and PPR-free epidemiological unit, we assessed the ability of different vaccination scenarios to reach the 70% PVIR throughout the program. The tested scenarios differed in i) their overall schedule, ii) their delivery month and iii) their vaccination coverage. Results In sheep reared in semi-arid areas, the vaccination month did affect the PVIR decay though it did not in goats in humid regions. In both cases, our study highlighted i) the importance of targeting the whole eligible population at least during the two first years of the vaccination program and ii) the importance of reaching a vaccination coverage as high as 80% of this population. This study confirmed the relevance of the vaccination schedules recommended by international organizations."
https://openalex.org/W2787499590,"Background and hypothesis Detrusor smooth muscle cells (DSMCs) of the urinary bladder are electrically connected to one another via gap junctions and form a three dimensional syncytium. DSMCs exhibit spontaneous electrical activity, including passive depolarizations and action potentials. The shapes of spontaneous action potentials (sAPs) observed from a single DSM cell can vary widely. The biophysical origins of this variability, and the precise components which contribute to the complex shapes observed are not known. To address these questions, the basic components which constitute the sAPs were investigated. We hypothesized that linear combinations of scaled versions of these basic components can produce sAP shapes observed in the syncytium. Methods and results The basic components were identified as spontaneous evoked junction potentials (sEJP), native AP (nAP), slow after hyperpolarization (sAHP) and very slow after hyperpolarization (vsAHP). The experimental recordings were grouped into two sets: a training data set and a testing data set. A training set was used to estimate the components, and a test set to evaluate the efficiency of the estimated components. We found that a linear combination of the identified components when appropriately amplified and time shifted replicated various AP shapes to a high degree of similarity, as quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE) measure. Conclusions We conclude that the four basic components—sEJP, nAP, sAHP, and vsAHP—identified and isolated in this work are necessary and sufficient to replicate all varieties of the sAPs recorded experimentally in DSMCs. This model has the potential to generate testable hypotheses that can help identify the physiological processes underlying various features of the sAPs. Further, this model also provides a means to classify the sAPs into various shape classes."
