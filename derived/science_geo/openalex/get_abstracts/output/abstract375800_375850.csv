https://openalex.org/W2065762344,"Soil acidification is a major problem in soils of intensive Chinese agricultural systems. We used two nationwide surveys, paired comparisons in numerous individual sites, and several long-term monitoring-field data sets to evaluate changes in soil acidity. Soil pH declined significantly (P < 0.001) from the 1980s to the 2000s in the major Chinese crop-production areas. Processes related to nitrogen cycling released 20 to 221 kilomoles of hydrogen ion (H+) per hectare per year, and base cations uptake contributed a further 15 to 20 kilomoles of H+ per hectare per year to soil acidification in four widespread cropping systems. In comparison, acid deposition (0.4 to 2.0 kilomoles of H+ per hectare per year) made a small contribution to the acidification of agricultural soils across China."

Here we describe the genome sequence of the wild grass Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium), which is, to our knowledge, the first member of the Pooideae subfamily to be sequenced. Comparison of the Brachypodium, rice and sorghum genomes shows a precise history of genome evolution across a broad diversity of the grasses, and establishes a template for analysis of the large genomes of economically important pooid grasses such as wheat. The high-quality genome sequence, coupled with ease of cultivation and transformation, small size and rapid life cycle, will help Brachypodium reach its potential as an important model system for developing new energy and food crops."

More than 1 billion people are estimated to lack sufficient dietary energy availability, and at least twice that number suffer micronutrient deficiencies. Because indicators inform action, much current research focuses on improving food insecurity measurement. Yet estimated prevalence rates and patterns remain tenuous because measuring food security, an elusive concept, remains difficult."

Typical massive galaxies in the distant Universe formed stars an order of magnitude more rapidly. Unless star formation was significantly more efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gas rich. Molecular gas observations in the distant Universe have so far been largely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers and quasars. Here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas in samples of typical massive star forming galaxies at <z>~1.2 and 2.3, when the Universe was 40% and 24% of its current age. Our measurements provide empirical evidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that the star formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. The average fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3 and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massive spiral galaxies. The slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires a mechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies."

Adapting production inputs site-specifically within a field and individually for each animal allows better use of resources to maintain the quality of the environment while improving the sustainability of the food supply. Precision agriculture provides a means to monitor the food production chain and manage both the quantity and quality of agricultural produce."

https://openalex.org/W2106624583,"Astrophysical observations indicate that dark matter constitutes most of the mass in our universe, but its nature remains unknown. Over the past decade, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS II) experiment has provided world-leading sensitivity for the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter. The final exposure of our low-temperature germanium particle detectors at the Soudan Underground Laboratory yielded two candidate events, with an expected background of 0.9 +/- 0.2 events. This is not statistically significant evidence for a WIMP signal. The combined CDMS II data place the strongest constraints on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent scattering cross section for a wide range of WIMP masses and exclude new parameter space in inelastic dark matter models."
https://openalex.org/W1987698895,"Farmers in mixed crop-livestock systems produce about half of the world’s food. In small holdings around the world, livestock are reared mostly on grass, browse, and nonfood biomass from maize, millet, rice, and sorghum crops and in their turn supply manure and traction for future crops. Animals act as insurance against hard times and supply farmers with a source of regular income from sales of milk, eggs, and other products. Thus, faced with population growth and climate change, small-holder farmers should be the first target for policies to intensify production by carefully managed inputs of fertilizer, water, and feed to minimize waste and environmental impact, supported by improved access to markets, new varieties, and technologies."

https://openalex.org/W2085190926,"An atom in open space can be detected by means of resonant absorption and reemission of electromagnetic waves, known as resonance fluorescence, which is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum optics. We report on the observation of scattering of propagating waves by a single artificial atom. The behavior of the artificial atom, a superconducting macroscopic two-level system, is in a quantitative agreement with the predictions of quantum optics for a pointlike scatterer interacting with the electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open space. The strong atom-field interaction as revealed in a high degree of extinction of propagating waves will allow applications of controllable artificial atoms in quantum optics and photonics."
https://openalex.org/W2098778302,"The Ediacaran Period (635 to 542 million years ago) was a time of fundamental environmental and evolutionary change, culminating in the first appearance of macroscopic animals. Here, we present a detailed spatial and temporal record of Ediacaran ocean chemistry for the Doushantuo Formation in the Nanhua Basin, South China. We find evidence for a metastable zone of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) waters impinging on the continental shelf and sandwiched within ferruginous [Fe(II)-enriched] deep waters. A stratified ocean with coeval oxic, sulfidic, and ferruginous zones, favored by overall low oceanic sulfate concentrations, was maintained dynamically throughout the Ediacaran Period. Our model reconciles seemingly conflicting geochemical redox conditions proposed previously for Ediacaran deep oceans and helps to explain the patchy temporal record of early metazoan fossils."

https://openalex.org/W2062648029,"Nanoparticles, Lightly Twisted The helical structures that are widespread in natural macromolecules result from well-coordinated bonding interactions and affect their physical properties in striking ways. To obtain helical nanoparticles, Srivastava et al. (p. 1355 , published online 11 February) slowly oxidized cadmium-tellurium under visible light and assembled ribbons of nanostructure. The ribbons were persuaded to twist into helices because they were doped with cadmium sulfide nanoparticles, which underwent surface oxidation and caused localized stresses that could only be relieved by a conformational change. The pitch of the twisted ribbons that were produced could be controlled by the intensity of illumination applied. This behavior offers promise for application in the development of materials with interesting optical properties."
https://openalex.org/W1973651679,"Benzodiazepines are widely used in clinics and for recreational purposes, but will lead to addiction in vulnerable individuals. Addictive drugs increase the levels of dopamine and also trigger long-lasting synaptic adaptations in the mesolimbic reward system that ultimately may induce the pathological behaviour. The neural basis for the addictive nature of benzodiazepines, however, remains elusive. Here we show that benzodiazepines increase firing of dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area through the positive modulation of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors in nearby interneurons. Such disinhibition, which relies on alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors expressed in these cells, triggers drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in excitatory afferents onto dopamine neurons and underlies drug reinforcement. Taken together, our data provide evidence that benzodiazepines share defining pharmacological features of addictive drugs through cell-type-specific expression of alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the ventral tegmental area. The data also indicate that subunit-selective benzodiazepines sparing alpha1 may be devoid of addiction liability."
https://openalex.org/W2027836023,"Insulin from the beta-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans controls energy homeostasis in vertebrates, and its deficiency causes diabetes mellitus. During embryonic development, the transcription factor neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) initiates the differentiation of the beta-cells and other islet cell types from pancreatic endoderm, but the genetic program that subsequently completes this differentiation remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the transcription factor Rfx6 directs islet cell differentiation downstream of Neurog3. Mice lacking Rfx6 failed to generate any of the normal islet cell types except for pancreatic-polypeptide-producing cells. In human infants with a similar autosomal recessive syndrome of neonatal diabetes, genetic mapping and subsequent sequencing identified mutations in the human RFX6 gene. These studies demonstrate a unique position for Rfx6 in the hierarchy of factors that coordinate pancreatic islet development in both mice and humans. Rfx6 could prove useful in efforts to generate beta-cells for patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2041423137,"Synaptic vesicle fusion in brain synapses occurs in phases that are either tightly coupled to action potentials (synchronous), immediately following action potentials (asynchronous), or as stochastic events in the absence of action potentials (spontaneous). Synaptotagmin-1, -2, and -9 are vesicle-associated Ca2+ sensors for synchronous release. Here we found that double C2 domain (Doc2) proteins act as Ca2+ sensors to trigger spontaneous release. Although Doc2 proteins are cytosolic, they function analogously to synaptotagmin-1 but with a higher Ca2+ sensitivity. Doc2 proteins bound to N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) complexes in competition with synaptotagmin-1. Thus, different classes of multiple C2 domain-containing molecules trigger synchronous versus spontaneous fusion, which suggests a general mechanism for synaptic vesicle fusion triggered by the combined actions of SNAREs and multiple C2 domain-containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1963956010,"How instructive cues present on the cell surface have their precise effects on the actin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Semaphorins are one of the largest families of these instructive cues and are widely studied for their effects on cell movement, navigation, angiogenesis, immunology and cancer. Semaphorins/collapsins were characterized in part on the basis of their ability to drastically alter actin cytoskeletal dynamics in neuronal processes, but despite considerable progress in the identification of semaphorin receptors and their signalling pathways, the molecules linking them to the precise control of cytoskeletal elements remain unknown. Recently, highly unusual proteins of the Mical family of enzymes have been found to associate with the cytoplasmic portion of plexins, which are large cell-surface semaphorin receptors, and to mediate axon guidance, synaptogenesis, dendritic pruning and other cell morphological changes. Mical enzymes perform reduction-oxidation (redox) enzymatic reactions and also contain domains found in proteins that regulate cell morphology. However, nothing is known of the role of Mical or its redox activity in mediating morphological changes. Here we report that Mical directly links semaphorins and their plexin receptors to the precise control of actin filament (F-actin) dynamics. We found that Mical is both necessary and sufficient for semaphorin-plexin-mediated F-actin reorganization in vivo. Likewise, we purified Mical protein and found that it directly binds F-actin and disassembles both individual and bundled actin filaments. We also found that Mical utilizes its redox activity to alter F-actin dynamics in vivo and in vitro, indicating a previously unknown role for specific redox signalling events in actin cytoskeletal regulation. Mical therefore is a novel F-actin-disassembly factor that provides a molecular conduit through which actin reorganization-a hallmark of cell morphological changes including axon navigation-can be precisely achieved spatiotemporally in response to semaphorins."
https://openalex.org/W2071414241,"Serotonin is a well known neurotransmitter in mammals and plays an important role in various mental functions in humans. In plants, the serotonin biosynthesis pathway and its function are not well understood. The rice sekiguchi lesion (sl) mutants accumulate tryptamine, a candidate substrate for serotonin biosynthesis. We isolated the SL gene by map-based cloning and found that it encodes CYP71P1 in a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase family. A recombinant SL protein exhibited tryptamine 5-hydroxylase enzyme activity and catalyzed the conversion of tryptamine to serotonin. This pathway is novel and has not been reported in mammals. Expression of SL was induced by the N-acetylchitooligosaccharide (chitin) elicitor and by infection with Magnaporthe grisea, a causal agent for rice blast disease. Exogenously applied serotonin induced defense gene expression and cell death in rice suspension cultures and increased resistance to rice blast infection in plants. We also found that serotonin-induced defense gene expression is mediated by the RacGTPase pathway and by the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. These results suggest that serotonin plays an important role in rice innate immunity.

We also found that serotonin-induced defense gene expression is mediated by the RacGTPase pathway and by the Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. These results suggest that serotonin plays an important role in rice innate immunity. Plants have developed various immune responses to protect themselves from pathogen attack (1Hammond-Kosack K.E. Parker J.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 14: 177-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). One of them is the hypersensitive response, which is often accompanied by programmed cell death, and is effective to prevent the growth of biotrophic pathogens (2Hofius D. Tsitsigiannis D.I. Jones J.D. Mundy J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2007; 17: 166-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The hypersensitive response is induced coordinately with production of reactive oxygen species, lignification, production of phytoalexins, and expression of defense-related genes. To understand the roles of hypersensitive response cell death in immune responses, a large number of lesion mimic mutants, in which cell death is spontaneously induced, have been investigated in many plant species, including rice, Arabidopsis, and maize (3Lorrain S. Vailleau F. Balagué C. Roby D. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Most of lesion mimic mutants are known to activate immune responses in the absence of pathogens (2Hofius D. Tsitsigiannis D.I. Jones J.D. Mundy J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2007; 17: 166-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A rice lesion mimic mutant, Sekiguchi lesion (sl), exhibits unique orange colored lesions that are induced by inoculation of pathogens, including Magnaporthe grisea (4Arase S. Ueno M. Toko M. Honda Y. Itho K. Ozoe Y. J. Phytopathol. 2001; 149: 409-413Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Ueno M. Shibata H. Kihara J. Honda Y. Arase S. Plant J. 2003; 36: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the sl mutants, increased activities of tryptophan decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase are correlated with lesion formation (5Ueno M. Shibata H. Kihara J. Honda Y. Arase S. Plant J. 2003; 36: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the SL gene and its function in cell death and disease resistance remain to be studied. Plant Rac/Rop GTPases constitute a unique subfamily of the Rho family of small GTPases and are highly conserved in plant species. In rice, OsRac1 regulates a series of immune responses, including cell death, reactive oxygen species production, activation of pathogenesis-related genes, liginification, and phytoalexin production (6Kawasaki T. Henmi K. Ono E. Hatakeyama S. Iwano M. Satoh H. Shimamoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10922-10926Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that OsRac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, HSP70, OsMAPK6, OsrbohB, Sti1/Hop, and RACK1 (7Lieberherr D. Thao N.P. Nakashima A. Umemura K. Kawasaki T. Shimamoto K.

Heterotrimeric G protein is also involved in innate immunity through OsRac1. In fact, rice dwarf1 (d1) mutants lacking a Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G protein reduces elicitor-induced defense gene expression and resistance to M. grisea (11Suharsono U. Fujisawa Y. Kawasaki T. Iwasaki Y. Satoh H. Shimamoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Serotonin is known as neurotransmitter in mammals, which regulates mood, sleep, and anxiety in human (12Gingrich J.A. Hen R. Psychopharmacology. 2001; 155: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although serotonin was found in many plant species (13Roshchina V.V. Roshchina V.V. Neurotransmitters in Plant Life. Science Publisher, Enfield, NH2001: 4-81Google Scholar), the serotonin biosynthesis and its function are unclear. Recently, serotonin has been reported to be accumulated in rice during senescence and defense response (14Kang K. Kim Y.S. Park S. Back K. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1380-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, serotonin is incorporated into the cell wall at disease lesions infected with Bipolaris oryzae and M. grisea, suggesting that serotonin plays an important role in control of the strength of the cell wall for the mechanical barrier against pathogens (15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To understand how the SL gene regulates cell death and disease resistance in rice, we have isolated the SL gene by a map-based approach. We found that the SL gene encodes cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, which catalyzes 5-hydroxylation of tryptamine to synthesize serotonin. In addition, our results suggest that serotonin contributes to innate immunity by activating intracellular signaling of immune responses. The wild type japonica rice cv. Kinmaze and four sl mutants (CM265, CM998, CM1019, and CM2229), induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in the Kinmaze background, were provided by the Japanese National BioResource Project of Rice. The CM265 mutant was used in a cross with a substitution line (SL239) carrying a segment of chromosome 12 from an indica rice (cv. Kasalath) in a japonica rice background (cv. Koshihikari). The F2 and F3 plants were analyzed using a sequence-tagged site and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers to construct a physical map of the region containing the SL gene (supplemental Fig. S1). Details of the mapping are provided in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. The SL cDNA was cloned into the p2K1 vector containing the maize Ubq1 promoter (16Miki D. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). For the RNA interference construct of Sti1a/Hop, a 350-bp 3′-untranslated region of the Sti1a cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned in the reverse orientation behind the Ubp1 promoter in the pANDA vector (16Miki D. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The RNA interference construct of OsRac1 was described previously (10Nakashima A. Chen L. Thao N.P. Fujiwara M. Wong H.L. Kuwano M. Umemura K. Shirasu K. Kawasaki T. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 2265-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Details of plasmid construction are provided in supplemental “Experimental Procedures”. Transgenic plants were generated from Agrobacterium-transformed rice calli (17Hiei Y. Ohta S. Komari T. Kumashiro T. Plant J. 1994; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2848) Google Scholar). Total RNAs were isolated from leaves and suspension cultures using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and used for reverse transcription-PCR and real time PCR with gene-specific primers (see supplemental Table S1). Rice seedlings were inoculated at the four- to six-leaf stage by spraying with aqueous spore suspensions containing 105 spores/ml of the compatible rice blast races 003 and 007. Inoculated seedlings were kept in a dark chamber with a moisture-saturated atmosphere at 24 °C for 20 h and then maintained in a greenhouse. Inoculated leaves were harvested at the indicated time points and used for real time PCR. To examine the effect of serotonin on rice blast resistance, rice seedlings were watered with 400 μg/ml serotonin for 22 h and then inoculated with race 007 as described above. Lesion development was scored on rice leaves at 6 days after inoculation by measuring lesion length with a ruler. Rice suspension cultures were treated with 2 μg/ml N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor, 400 μg/ml (1.88 mm) serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (Mr 212.68)), or 400 μg/ml (2.03 mm) tryptamine (tryptamine hydrochloride (Mr 196.68)), and then incubated for various lengths of time. As reported previously (15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), less than 30% of applied serotonin is considered to be incorporated by the feeding experiment. Total RNAs were extracted from each sample and subjected to real time PCR. For the detection of cell death, suspension-cultured cells were treated with serotonin or tryptamine for 24 h, stained for 10 min with 0.05% (w/v) Evans Blue, and then washed four times with distilled water (18Hayashi M. Takahashi H. Tamura K. Huang J. Yu L.H. Kawai-Yamada M. Tezuka T. Uchimiya H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7020-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Dye bound to dead cells was dissolved in a solution of 50% methanol and 1% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C and quantified by absorbance at 595 nm. The SL and SL-G455D (CM265) cDNAs were cloned as SpeI-PstI fragments in the pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) and used to transform E. coli strain DH10Bac (Invitrogen). Preparation of the cDNA- containing recombinant baculovirus DNAs and transfection of Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Heterologous expression in Sf9 cells and spectrophotometric analysis of P450s were carried out as described previously (19Saito S. Hirai N. Matsumoto C. Ohigashi H. Ohta D. Sakata K. Mizutani M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1439-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Microsomal fractions of insect cells expressing either SL or SL-G455D were obtained as follows. Infected suspension-cultured cells (300 ml) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and suspended in buffer A, consisting of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.25), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the pellet was homogenized with buffer A to provide the microsomal fractions. The microsomal fractions were stored at −80 °C before the enzyme assays were performed. SL activity was reconstituted by mixing the microsomes with purified Arabidopsis NADPH-P450 reductase (20Mizutani M. Ohta D. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.25), 50 pmol/ml recombinant P450 protein, 0.1 unit/ml NADPH-P450 reductase, 1 mm NADPH, and 100 μm tryptamine. Reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH, and were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. The samples were diluted with 20 mm phosphate (pH 2.5) and subjected to HPLC 4The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyTDCtryptophan decarboxylaseERendoplasmic reticulumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinSECFPsuper enhanced cyan fluorescent protein. as follows: column, COSMOSIL 5C18-PAQ column (150 mm length × 4.6 mm inner diameter; Nacalai Tesque); solvent, 20 mm phosphate (pH 2.5); flow rate, 1.0 ml/min; detection, a fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength at 285 nm and an emission wavelength at 340 nm. Retention times of authentic samples were 6.5 min for serotonin and 14.5 min for tryptamine. The identity of the reaction product with tryptamine was examined using HPLC equipped with an API-3000 triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis, SL activity was assayed using the substrate tryptamine at concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 μm. Reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH and carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. The kinetic constants were calculated from triplicate data sets. Km and kcat values were calculated from a double-reciprocal plot of the initial velocity (v0) versus substrate concentration. high pressure liquid chromatography tryptophan decarboxylase endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein super enhanced cyan fluorescent protein. Microsomal fractions of the insect cells, expressing either SL or SL-G455D, were subjected to immunoblotting using a purified anti-SL antibody as described in supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” To identify a gene responsible for the sl phenotype, we used four sl mutants (CM265, CM2229, CM998, and CM1019; supplemental Fig. S1), which were generated by mutagenesis using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (21Satoh H. Omura T. J. Fac. Agr. Kyushu Univ. 1979; 24: 165-174Google Scholar). The sl locus was mapped to a 350-kb genomic region on chromosome 12, where 7 candidate genes are located (supplemental Fig. S1). PCR experiments indicated that the CM998 mutant has a 30-kb deletion containing genes for a P450 and a zinc finger protein. 5M. Isshiki, unpublished results. Sequence analyses in the other mutants revealed that SL encodes a P450 monooxygenase (Fig. 1A). SL gene expression levels were significantly reduced in CM2229. CM998 showed no SL expression because of the deletion of the entire P450 gene. CM1019 had two altered transcripts as follows: an unspliced transcript resulting from a point mutation at the 3′ splice site of the single intron, and another generated by cryptic splicing at a site near the 3′ splice site (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of the P450 mRNA complemented the sl phenotype (supplemental Fig. S2). The SL protein possesses motifs conserved in P450 proteins, including the heme-binding motif, the EXXR motif, and the proline-rich motif (supplemental Fig. S3). The G455D mutation in CM265 is in the heme-binding motif and is likely to disturb the heme coordination structure. The threonine residue at position 314, which is mutated in CM2229, is important for the oxygen activation process in the P450 catalytic cycle (supplemental Fig. S3). The SL protein shares 41% identity with CYP71A1 from avocado fruit (GenBankTM accession number AAA32913). In rice there are 90 genes and 28 pseudogenes in the CYP71 family; however, the SL protein shows less than 45% identity with any other members of the family. Hence, the SL protein is a unique member of the CYP71 family and is designated CYP71P1. The intracellular location of the SL protein was investigated using the transient expression of a GFP-fused protein in rice protoplasts (Fig. 1C). The SL protein, with GFP fused to the C terminus, co-localized with a marker protein that was designed to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The marker protein was constructed by adding the N-terminal signal peptide of pro-2S albumin, which localizes to the ER (22Hara-Hishimura I. Takeuchi Y. Inoue K. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1993; 4: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal HDEL ER retention sequence, to SECFP (23Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). The results indicate that SL localizes to the ER. Expression of the SL gene in rice suspension cultures was analyzed after treatment with a chitin elicitor that is known to induce a series of defense responses in rice (Fig. 1D) (24Yamaguchi T. Yamada A. Hong N. Ogawa T. Ishii T. Shibuya N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 817-826PubMed Google Scholar). A clear increase in SL mRNA levels was observed at 1 h after chitin treatment (Fig. 1D). We also analyzed SL expression after infection with M. grisea. Infection by two races of compatible blast fungus caused the activation of SL gene expression in rice plants at 48 h after infection, and expression was further increased at 72 h (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that SL has a role in rice innate immunity. It was shown previously that tryptamine levels were higher in an sl mutant than in wild type plants and that serotonin levels were very low (4Arase S. Ueno M. Toko M. Honda Y. Itho K. Ozoe Y. J. Phytopathol. 2001; 149: 409-413Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Ueno M. Shibata H. Kihara J. Honda Y. Arase S. Plant J. 2003; 36: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SL converts tryptamine to serotonin. To test this possibility, we generated recombinant SL protein with or without the G455D mutation found in the CM265 allele, using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells. The presence of the recombinant SL and SL-G455D proteins in the microsomal fractions was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). Fractions containing the wild type SL protein had a cytochrome P450-specific reduced CO difference spectrum with a clear absorption peak at 450 nm (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the fractions containing the SL-G455D protein exhibited no reduced CO difference spectrum (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that SL protein is indeed a cytochrome P450 enzyme. The microsomal fractions from insect cells expressing the recombinant SL proteins were used in enzyme assays with tryptamine as the potential substrate. HPLC analysis of the reaction products showed a specific peak at the same retention time as that of serotonin when fractions containing the wild type SL protein, but not the SL-G455D mutant protein, were used (Fig. 2C). The SL protein catalyzed the 5-hydroxylation of tryptamine with a high affinity and efficiency (Km = 7.3 ± 0.8 μm and kcat = 45 ± 1.5 min−1), although the SL protein did not metabolize tryptophan, indole 3-acetic acid, or tyramine. Thus, it is likely that the SL protein is tryptamine 5-hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of tryptamine to serotonin. Serotonin has been reported to be accumulated at a high level (1.9 mm) in disease lesions infected with B. oryzae and M. grisea (15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), whereas the high accumulation of serotonin is abolished in the sl mutant. In addition, the sl mutant is more susceptible to infection of B. oryzae as compared with wild type, and application of serotonin suppresses the fungal growth in the leaves of the sl mutant (15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that serotonin is involved in innate immunity. To elucidate how serotonin regulates immunity responses, we analyzed the expression of four defense genes, probenazol 1 (PBZ1), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1 (PAL1), chitinase 1 (Cht1), and chitinase 3 (Cht3) in rice cell suspension cultures. These four genes are induced by chitin elicitor from fungal pathogens (25Midoh N. Iwata M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). 6S. H. Kim, unpublished results. Expression of these defense genes was clearly induced at 12 h after serotonin treatment, but no induction was found with tryptamine (Fig. 3, A–D). Serotonin also induced cell death in cultured rice cells, as shown by Evans Blue staining (Fig. 3E), although reduced levels of cell death occurred after tryptamine treatment. Because serotonin was able to induce immune responses in rice cell cultures, we examined the possibility that known components of rice innate immunity are involved in serotonin-induced defense gene induction. It has been shown that the small GTPase OsRac1 and its signaling partners, including Sti1/Hop and a heterotrimeric G protein, are involved in rice innate immunity (8Thao N.P. Chen L. Nakashima A. Hara S. Umemura K. Takahashi A. Shirasu K. Kawasaki T. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 4035-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 10Nakashima A. Chen L. Thao N.P. Fujiwara M. Wong H.L. Kuwano M. Umemura K. Shirasu K. Kawasaki T. Shimamoto K. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 2265-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Ono E. Wong H.L. Kawasaki T. Hasegawa M. Kodama O. Shimamoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used rice cell cultures expressing RNA interference knockdown constructs for OsRac1 and Sti1/Hop, and a cell culture of the dwarf1 (d1) mutant, which lacks a functional Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (11Suharsono U. Fujisawa Y. Kawasaki T. Iwasaki Y. Satoh H. Shimamoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The results clearly showed that these proteins are involved in serotonin-induced defense gene induction (Fig. 4, A–D). Because our results suggest that serotonin plays a role in rice innate immunity, we examined whether serotonin treatment of rice seedlings (∼1 month old) had any effect on infection with a compatible race of M. grisea. The results indicate that seedlings treated with serotonin are significantly more resistant to fungal infection than mock-treated seedlings (Fig. 5), suggesting that serotonin has the ability to induce resistance against rice blast infection. Serotonin is a well known neurotransmitter in mammals and plays an important role in various mental functions in humans (27Geyer M.A. Vollenweider F.X. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2008; 29: 445-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In mammals, serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan in two steps involving l-tryptophan 5-hydroxylase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (Fig. 6) (28Mockus S.M. Vrana K.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 163-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Tryptophan hydroxylase belongs to a family of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and requires iron and the coenzyme tetrahydropterin for catalytic activity (29Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14083-14091Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It is interesting that the SL gene encodes CYP71P1 in the P450 superfamily, which is different from the tetrahydropterin-dependent hydroxylase family in mammals (Fig. 6). Serotonin has been found in more than 42 plant species (13Roshchina V.V. Roshchina V.V. Neurotransmitters in Plant Life. Science Publisher, Enfield, NH2001: 4-81Google Scholar), suggesting that enzymes for serotonin biosynthesis are conserved in plants. However, the SL orthologs have not been found in other plants, including Arabidopsis. Among the Arabidopsis P450s, CYP83B1/SUR2 shows the highest identity (39%) with the SL protein. CYP83B1/SUR2 catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of indole-3-acetaldoxime to synthesize indole glucosinolate (30Bak S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A. Galbraith D.W. Feyereisen R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). It has been reported that some serotonin derivatives such as coumaroylserotonin and feruloylserotonin, which are hydroxycinnamic acid amides, are involved in plant defense responses against pathogen infection (31Hahlbroch K. Scheel D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 347-369Crossref Google Scholar). The accumulation of hydroxycinnamic acid amides in the cell wall could provide an undegradable mechanical barrier for pathogens (31Hahlbroch K. Scheel D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 40: 347-369Crossref Google Scholar, 32Keller H. Hohlfeld H. Wray V. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Strack D. Phytochemistry. 1996; 42: 389-396Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In fact, it was shown that serotonin itself is polymerized and incorporated into cell walls in rice, leading to the suppression of growth of the fungus B. oryzae (15Ishihara A. Hashimoto Y. Tanaka C. Dubouzet J.G. Nakao T. Matsuda F. Nishioka T. Miyagawa H. Wakasa K. Plant J. 2008; 54: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It was also shown that hydroxycinnamic acid amides possess anti-fungal activity (33Miyagawa H. Ishihara A. Nishimoto T. Ueno T. Mayama S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 2305-2306Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that serotonin may act as a phytoalexin, an antimicrobial compound that is produced by plant cells in response to pathogen infection. However, we found no effect of serotonin on the germination of M. grisea spores (supplemental Table S2). In this study, we found that serotonin induces immune responses including defense gene expression and cell death through the pathway involved in Gα, OsRac1, and Sti1. Taken together, it is suggested that serotonin may have dual functions that regulate the strength of the cell wall for the physical barrier against pathogens as well as activate intracellular signaling for immune responses. We have identified SL as tryptamine 5-hydroxylase enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis, and we showed that in rice, serotonin is synthesized in different pathways found in animals. Recently, it was reported that serotonin is accumulated during senescence in rice (14Kang K. Kim Y.S. Park S. Back K. Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1380-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, whether SL is involved in senescence response remains to be analyzed. Two genes, tryptophan decarboxylase and SL, required for serotonin synthesis from tryptophan have now been identified in plants. It is therefore possible to control the serotonin levels in plants by manipulating the expression of these genes.

We mapped the preferred calpain cleavage site between the two C-terminal proline-rich regions after Ser-745, resulting in a C-terminal fragment similar in size to the FAK-related non-kinase (FRNK). We generated mutant FAK with a point mutation (V744G) that renders FAK resistant to calpain proteolysis but retains other biochemical properties of FAK. Using time-lapse microscopy, we show that the dynamics of green fluorescent protein-talin1 are impaired in FAK-deficient cells. Expression of wild-type but not calpain-resistant FAK rescues talin dynamics in FAK-deficient cells.

https://openalex.org/W2025484732,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease (AD). There is considerable consensus that the increased production and/or aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PD and related synucleinopathies. Current therapeutic strategies for treating PD offer mainly transient symptomatic relief and aim at the restitution of dopamine levels to counterbalance the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, the identification and development of drug-like molecules that block alpha-synuclein aggregation and prevent the loss of dopaminergic neurons are desperately needed to treat or slow the progression of PD. Here, we show that entacapone and tolcapone are potent inhibitors of alpha-syn and beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomerization and fibrillogenesis, and they also protect against extracellular toxicity induced by the aggregation of both proteins. Comparison of the anti-aggregation properties of entacapone and tolcapone with the effect of five other catechol-containing compounds, dopamine, pyrogallol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and quercetin on the oligomerization and fibrillization of alpha-syn and Abeta, demonstrate that the catechol moiety is essential for the anti-amyloidogenic activity. Our findings present the first characterization of the anti-amyloidogenic properties of tolcapone and entacapone against both alpha-synuclein and Abeta42 and highlight the potential of this class of nitro-catechol compounds as anti-amyloidogenic agents. Their inhibitory properties, mode of action, and structural properties suggest that they constitute promising lead compounds for further optimization."

Adenosine is an important signaling molecule. The concentration of this metabolite in tissues and blood is normally low. However, its local concentration can increase significantly as a result of cell damage or stress conditions such as inflammation, ischemia, and hypoxia (1Haskó G. Linden J. Cronstein B. Pacher P.

Adenosine deaminases (ADAs) decrease the local concentration of adenosine by catalyzing the deamination of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively. Two types of enzymes with the adenosine deaminase activity are known, the ADA1 family proteins and adenosine deaminase growth factors (ADGF) or ADA2-like proteins (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ADA1, ADGF/ADA2, and the recently discovered ADA-like (ADAL) or ADA3 proteins (the activity of which have not yet been characterized) display a limited sequence homology in the region of the catalytic domain, thus constituting three distantly related branches of an ADA superfamily (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ADA1 proteins are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, whereas ADGF/ADA2 are observed only in eukaryotes and primarily in multicellular organisms (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All three types of ADA are present in humans, where they are known as ADA1, ADA2, and ADA3 (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In flies, ADGF/ADA2 is the only active adenosine deaminative enzyme (3Zurovec M. Dolezal T. Gazi M. Pavlova E. Bryant P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4403-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas in rodents, there is only a gene for ADA1 (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins have overlapping functions but that the presence of the two in a given organism is beneficial for its survival. The function of ADA1 is mainly to reduce the intracellular level of adenosine, which is toxic for cells, and more specifically, for lymphocytes. The apoptotic death of lymphocytes triggered by adenosine and its derivatives is thought to be one of the main reasons why the absence of functional ADA1 results in severe combined immunodeficiency in humans (4Hershfield M.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

The physiological role is best described for the Drosophila homologue, ADGF-A (3Zurovec M. Dolezal T. Gazi M. Pavlova E. Bryant P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

ADGF-A was shown to be crucial for fly survival, and the knock-out of the corresponding gene results in abnormal larval development and multiple melanocytic tumors. ADGF-A was found to have an autocrine ADA-dependent mutagenic activity toward macrophage-like hemocytes, suggesting its role in the function of the innate immune system in invertebrates. The knock-out of ADGF/ADA2 homologues in frogs causes a reduction in the body size and abnormalities of body axis in frog embryos, which illustrates the important role of ADGF/ADA2 proteins in the embryogenesis of amphibians (19Iijima R. Kunieda T. Yamaguchi S. Kamigaki H. Fujii-Taira I. Sekimizu K. Kubo T. Natori S. Homma K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2255-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike ADA1, all ADGF/ADA2 proteins possess secretion signal sequences and are found in the extracellular space (2Maier S.A. Galellis J.R. McDermid H.E. J. Mol. Evol. 2005; 61: 776-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). ADGF/ADA2 proteins contain considerably longer sequences than those of ADA1 proteins. One of the characteristic features of ADGF/ADA2 is an 80–100-amino acid extension at the N terminus that was suggested to be responsible for their growth factor activity (3Zurovec M. Dolezal T. Gazi M. Pavlova E. Bryant P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4403-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Charlab R. Valenzuela J.G. Andersen J. Ribeiro J.M.

Although the ADA2 activity in human plasma was discovered quite some time ago, the protein was purified only recently, and it was found to be encoded by the cat eye syndrome critical region gene 1 (CECR1), a gene located on chromosome 22 (21Zavialov A.V. Engström A. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Riazi M.A. Brinkman-Mills P. Nguyen T. Pan H. Phan S. Ying F. Roe B.A. Tochigi J. Shimizu Y. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Buchwald M. McDermid H.E. Genomics. 2000; 64: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Human ADA2 and ADA1 have different catalytic and biochemical properties: ADA2 has 100-fold lower Km than ADA1, an acidic optimum pH for ADA activity, and forms a homodimer (21Zavialov A.V. Engström A. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). ADA2 likely plays a role in development because the excess of ADA2 production due to a partial triplication of 22q11.2 chromosome results in several developmental abnormalities associated with cat eye syndrome (23Meins M. Burfeind P. Motsch S. Trappe R. Bartmus D. Langer S. Speicher M.R. Mühlendyck H. Bartels I. Zoll B. J. Med. Genet. 2003; 40: e62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent study 4A. Zavialov, E. Gracia, N. Glaichenhaus, R. Franco, G. Lauvau, and A. Zavialov, unpublished results. showed that human ADA2 is specifically secreted by antigen-presenting cells and induces differentiation of monocytes to macrophages as well as stimulating the proliferation of macrophages and CD4+ T cells. This cytokine-like growth factor activity of ADA2 requires binding to cell surface receptors. We found that ADA2 binds to different types of cells via proteoglycans and more specifically to T cells via an unknown receptor. As we also found that ADA2 can bind to and modulate the affinity of ADRs, we hypothesized that the ADA2 binding to T cells is mediated by ADRs or an ADR-proteoglycan complex. Previously, the binding to the cell surface via unknown receptors was found for insects (17Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13770-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Homma K.J. Tanaka Y. Matsushita T. Yokoyama K. Matsui H. Natori S. J. Biol.

Sekimizu K. Kubo T. Natori S. Homma K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2255-2264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that this might be a common signaling mechanism for ADGF/ADA2 proteins that is complementary to or cooperating with the signaling via the enzymatic activity. In this study, we have determined the high resolution crystal structures of ADA2 and ADA2 complexed with a transition state analogue. In addition to the catalytic domain, the structures discovered two ADGF/ADA2-specific domains of novel folds that mediate the protein dimerization and binding to the cell surface receptors. Structures of the apoenzyme and enzyme complexed with coformycin allowed for the dissecting of the molecular details of the catalytic mechanism of ADGF/ADA2 proteins. Despite the structural conservation of the catalytic domain, a unique arrangement of the substrate-binding pocket was revealed, providing an explanation to the substrate and inhibitor specificity of ADGF/ADA2 proteins as well as providing the basis for the design of the first specific inhibitor for human ADA2. Total RNA was extracted from THP1 cells using RNAgents kit (Promega), and cDNA was prepared using random hexamers and SuperScript II reverse transcription-polymerase (Invitrogen). The CECR1 gene was amplified using forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table 1S) and inserted into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen). For the protein expression, the CECR1 gene was further modified with a biotinylation site and a His6 tag sequence on its C terminus and a leader BiP sequence on the N terminus (supplemental Fig. 1S). The construct was then subcloned into a plasmid pRMHa3 (24Bunch T.A. Grinblat Y. Goldstein L.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1043-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) for ADA2 expression in insect cells. S2 Drosophila cells were co-transfected with pRMHa3-ADA2 plasmid and pS2neo plasmids carrying the antibiotic resistance gene through the use of a calcium phosphate transfection kit (Invitrogen). Stable transformants were selected using 1.5 mg/ml G418 of antibiotic (Invitrogen). To overexpress ADA2, the cells were cultured for 10 days in Express Five SFM medium (Invitrogen) in the presence of 0.5 mm of CuSO4. The supernatant was then collected after centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min, diluted with an equal volume of 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.8), and then applied to a column with heparin-Sepharose gel (GE Healthcare). The protein was eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 500 mm NaCl and applied directly to a HiTrap chelating HP column charged with Ni2+. ADA2 was eluted using a 5–300 mm imidazole gradient. The fractions containing ADA2 activity were pooled, concentrated using Amicon Ultra concentrators (Millipore), and further purified on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated either with phosphate-buffered saline or with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) buffer. Crystallization was performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. Large plate-like crystals were obtained in drops with 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 5% polyethylene glycol 8000 in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.04, in the absence or presence of 2 mm coformycin (a kind gift from Dr. Bertil Fredholm, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). Crystals of both apoADA2 and ADA2 complexed with coformycin belong to space group P1 with unit cell dimensions around a = 63 Å, b = 73 Å, c = 81 Å, α = 113°, β = 94°, γ = 92° (see Table 1), and one copy of the ADA2 dimer per asymmetric unit. To obtain a derivative for heavy metal phasing, crystals were incubated with precipitant solution containing 5 mm K2Pt(NO2)4 for 12 h. Diffraction data were collected under liquid nitrogen cryoconditions at 100 K. Crystals were flash-cooled by rapidly dipping them in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beam-line ID29 European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), France, using an ADSC Q315R CCD-based detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). Data were collected, processed, and reduced using MOSFLM and SCALA (25Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Using PHENIX (26Adams P.D. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Hung L.W. Ioerger T.R. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Read R.J.

The initial model was constructed using PHENIX and O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar).

The ligand consisted of three N-sulfo-d-glucosamine 6-O-sulfate (GlcNS6S) residues separated by l-iduronate 2-O-sulfate (IdoA2S) residues (OMe-GlcNS6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-IdoA2S-GlcNS6S-OMe). Because the IdoA2S residue can adopt different ring conformations, two model conformations were used, one in which all IdoA2S residues were in the 1C4 ring form and another in which the 2S0 ring form was adopted. The model ligand had fixed glycosidic torsion angles, taken from a heparin NMR structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 1HPN). Flexibility was allowed for all exocyclic torsion angles. Approximately 0.2 μg of radiolabeled glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (31Petersen F. Brandt E. Lindahl U. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12376-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were incubated with indicated concentrations of ADA2 in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Unbound GAG was removed by filtration through a nitrocellulose filter, whereas protein-bound GAG was trapped on the filter surface. The amount of protein-bound GAG was determined by counting the radioactivity associated with the filter using scintillation counting. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The Arg-8–Lys-14 deletion and point mutations W336G, C111G, and W136G were introduced in the pRMHa3-iCECR1 plasmids using the oligonucleotides R8-K14, W336G, C111G, and W136G, respectively (supplemental Table 1S). To elucidate the structural basis of the catalytic and growth factor activities of ADGF/ADA2 proteins, we determined high resolution crystal structures of the human ADA2 apoenzyme and of the enzyme complexed with a transition state analogue, coformycin (CF). The crystal structure of the secreted apoenzyme was solved using the platinum single anomalous diffraction method and refined to a final resolution of 2.0 Å; this structure was later used as a search model to solve the structure of the enzyme complexed with CF that was subsequently refined to a final resolution of 2.5 Å (Table 1). Asymmetric units of both apo-complexed and CF-complexed enzyme crystals contain two nearly identical monomers related by a local dyad axis (Fig. 1A). The monomers display large interactive surfaces (∼4700 Å2) dominated by hydrophobic interactions (∼2800 Å2), strongly suggesting that ADA2 is a functional homodimer. This is in agreement with our gel filtration (see Fig. 6C) and cross-linking (supplemental Fig. 3S) analysis of purified ADA2 as well as gel filtration studies of partially purified ADA2 from human plasma (21Zavialov A.V.

This so-called quantum interference has been observed in nanostructures using surface probes such as scanning tunneling microscopy. Now, Oka et al. (p. 843 ) use the spin-polarized version of this technique to study spin-dependent quantum interference on a triangular nanoscale cobalt island deposited on a copper surface. They observe the modulation of the magnetization, with the pattern depending on the energy of the interfering electrons. The experimental results are in good agreement with simulations, which indicate that the magnetization at a given energy and position largely depends on which of two electron spin states present dominates."
https://openalex.org/W1969591740,"The crystal structure of the human A(2A) adenosine receptor bound to the A(2A) receptor-specific antagonist, ZM241385, was recently determined at 2.6-A resolution. Surprisingly, the antagonist binds in an extended conformation, perpendicular to the plane of the membrane, and indicates a number of interactions unidentified before in ZM241385 recognition. To further understand the selectivity of ZM241385 for the human A(2A) adenosine receptor, we examined the effect of mutating amino acid residues within the binding cavity likely to have key interactions and that have not been previously examined. Mutation of Phe-168 to Ala abolishes both agonist and antagonist binding as well as receptor activity, whereas mutation of this residue to Trp or Tyr had only moderate effects. The Met-177 --> Ala mutation impeded antagonist but not agonist binding. Finally, the Leu-249 --> Ala mutant showed neither agonist nor antagonist binding affinity. From our results and previously published mutagenesis data, we conclude that conserved residues Phe-168(5.29), Glu-169(5.30), Asn-253(6.55), and Leu-249(6.51) play a central role in coordinating the bicyclic core present in both agonists and antagonists. By combining the analysis of the mutagenesis data with a comparison of the sequences of different adenosine receptor subtypes from different species, we predict that the interactions that determine subtype selectivity reside in the more divergent ""upper"" region of the binding cavity while the ""lower"" part of the binding cavity is conserved across adenosine receptor subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1990588916,"ATP-dependent proteases are currently emerging as key regulators of mitochondrial functions. Among these proteolytic systems, Pim1, a Lon-like serine protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is involved in the control of selective protein turnover in the mitochondrial matrix. In the absence of Pim1, yeast cells have been shown to accumulate electron-dense inclusion bodies in the matrix space, to lose integrity of mitochondrial genome, and to be respiration-deficient. Because of the severity of phenotypes associated with the depletion of Pim1, this protease appears to be an essential component of the protein quality control machinery in mitochondria and to exert crucial functions during the biogenesis of this organelle. Nevertheless, its physiological substrates and partners are not fully characterized. Therefore, we used the combination of different proteomic techniques to assess the nature of oxidized protein substrates and physiological partners of Pim1 protease under non-repressing growth conditions.

The results presented here supply evidence that Pim1-mediated proteolysis is required for elimination of oxidatively damaged proteins in mitochondria. Proteolysis by AAA+ proteases (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) (1Mogk A. Haslberger T. Tessarz P. Bukau B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of mitochondrial functions. These energy-dependent proteases are present in various subcompartments of mitochondria. Two major proteases, Pim1/Lon and ClpP, are present in the mitochondrial matrix, and two membrane-embedded proteases, Yme1 (i-AAA) and Yta10/Yta12 (m-AAA), with their proteolytic domains facing the matrix and the intermembrane space, respectively, are known to degrade membrane proteins (2Leidhold C.

These ATP-dependent proteases are believed to fulfill a dual function in the organelle. First, they carry out the elimination of non-assembled, damaged, or misfolded proteins, thus ensuring the proper stoichiometry of multienzyme complexes and preventing the accumulation of harmful aggregated polypeptides in mitochondria. Additionally, these proteases display regulatory functions by selectively degrading some mitochondrial protein targets, which appears to be crucial for mitochondrial biogenesis. Among these proteolytic systems, Pim1 (proteolysis into mitochondria) is a highly conserved ATP-dependent Lon-like protease in S. cerevisiae (5Wang N. Gottesman S. Willingham M.C. Gottesman M.M.

No homologue of ClpP was found in yeast and Pim1 is therefore the only ATP-dependent protease in the mitochondrial matrix of this organism. Unlike many AAA+ proteases, Pim1 contains three domains (N domain, AAA+ module, and proteolytic domain) that are encoded in the same polypeptide chain and forms homoheptameric complexes (8Stahlberg H. Kutejová E. Suda K. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Schatz G. Engel A. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 6787-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).

Disruption of PIM1 causes severe phenotypes. Cells lacking PIM1 accumulate electron-dense inclusion bodies in the matrix space, presumably corresponding to aggregated proteins, and are respiration-deficient. This has been attributed to the loss of mtDNA 5The abbreviations used are: mtDNAmitochondrial DNAGEgel electrophoresisTAPtandem affinity purificationCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMops4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption ionizationTOFtime-of-flightMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MS. integrity in Pim1-deficient cells, resulting in a ρ− phenotype (6Van Dyck L.

Science. 1994; 264: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for the loss of mtDNA integrity in Pim1 mutants are still elusive, but the proteolytic function of Pim1 protease has been implicated (20Wagner I. van Dyck L. Savel'ev A.S. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7317-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, impaired respiratory competence in Pim1 mutants can also be assigned to the role of the protease in the splicing of introns encoding maturases in COB and COX1 transcripts (21van Dyck L.

Pim1 appears to be an essential component of the protein quality control system in mitochondria, also harboring crucial functions in the biogenesis of the organelle. Nevertheless, its physiological substrates and partners are not fully characterized. Major et al. (10Major T. von Janowsky B. Ruppert T. Mogk A. Voos W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 762-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were able to identify a novel subset of Pim1 substrates by a proteomic approach using glucose as a carbon source. In the present work, we investigated the substrate specificity of Pim1 protease by comparing mitochondrial oxidized proteomes between wild-type (WT) and Pim1-depleted cells (Δpim1) grown under non-repressing conditions, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (GE) analyses. Because mitochondrial protein composition depends on protein degradation mediated by proteases present in the organelle, we hypothesized that the absence of Pim1 would result in the accumulation of its specific degradation substrates. Using the combination of different proteomic approaches, 19 proteins were found to be more abundant in Δpim1 mitochondria, accumulating or not as preferentially oxidized products. We also examined the influence of repressing/non-repressing growth conditions on the steady state level of Pim1 substrates, and we assessed the range of Pim1 partners using tandem affinity purification (TAP). According to their nature and function, proteins of interest were classified into five categories: 1) mitochondrial stress proteins, 2) mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, 3) respiratory chain subunits, 4) mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and 5) mtDNA nucleoid proteins. Our results provide new insights into regulatory functions of Pim1 in mitochondria and illustrate the role performed by mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases in the protein quality control and the biogenesis of this organelle. The strains used in this study were SC0437 (MATa; ade2; arg4; leu2-3, 112; trp1-289; ura3-52; lon::TAP-K.I.URA3) and SC0000 (MATa; ade2; arg4; leu2-3, 112; trp1-289; ura3-52), ordered from Euroscarf (Frankfurt, Germany). The Δlon (Δpim1) and isogenic wild-type WT strains referred to throughout this study had been described previously (22van Dijl J.M. Kutejová E. Suda K. Perecko D. Schatz G. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl.

Non-respiring mutant strains were tested for the presence of wild-type mtDNA (ρ+) by scoring growth on a non-fermentable carbon source. SC0000 and SC0437 strains were grown at 30 °C in YPGR (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.1% glucose, 2% raffinose). Δlon (Δpim1) and isogenic WT strains were grown in yeast nitrogen base lacking uracil containing 0.1% dextrose and 2% raffinose (raffinose medium) or 2% dextrose (dextrose medium). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with 50 ml of ice-cold water, and resuspended in MST buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 1 tablet/50 ml of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), at a protein concentration of 25 mg/ml. About 4 ml of 425–600-μm acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added to each tube, and the cells were lysed by vortexing three times for 2 min with 2-min intervals on ice. All of the subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Glass beads and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were used to prepare total cell protein extracts. Alternatively, supernatants were centrifuged (14,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C); pellets were resuspended with MST buffer to prepare mitochondrial protein extracts, whereas supernatants were used to prepare cytosolic extracts. The purity of mitochondrial extracts was evaluated using specific antibodies (supplemental Fig. S1). Mitochondrial membrane fractions were prepared from isolated mitochondria swollen for 10 min at 4 °C in 50 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.2, and subjected to an ultracentrifugation step (100,000 × g, 1 h at 4 °C). Protein content was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Samples were then prepared in Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 5 min at 100 °C.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to the yeast Cox4 and Rip1 proteins were a gift from Dr. G. Isaya (Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MI). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against Atp2 and Atp7 were a gift from Dr. J. Velours (IBGC, Bordeaux, France). Polyclonal antibody against lipoic acid was purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-porin antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody obtained from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Anti-TAP polyclonal antibody was obtained from Biovalley (Marne la Vallée, France).

Monoclonal antibody against Mrp20 was a gift from Dr. C. Suzuki (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, NJ). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Ilv5 and Hsp78 were provided by Dr. J. Marszalek (University of Gdansk). A polyclonal antibody against yeast aconitase targeted to residues 495–511 of S. cerevisiae mitochondrial aconitase and a polyclonal antibody against Pim1 targeted to residues 337–353 were described previously (23Bulteau A.L.

Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were electrotransferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). Primary antibody binding was detected by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescent substrate ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Carbonylated proteins were detected and analyzed following derivatization of protein carbonyl groups with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, using the OxyBlot kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunodetection was performed utilizing 10 μg of mitochondrial protein per lane with a primary antibody directed against dinitrophenylhydrazone. Mitochondrial proteolytic activity was assayed by determining the rate of fluorescein isothiocyanate-casein (Sigma) degradation, as described previously (23Bulteau A.L. Dancis A. Gareil M. Montagne J.J. Camadro J.M. Lesuisse E. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 42: 1561-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The tagged complexes were purified from 8 mg of mitochondria isolated from two different yeast strains (from Euroscarf), SC0000 (control strain expressing the Pim1 protein) and SC0437 (strain expressing the Pim1-TAP fusion protein). Mitochondria were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The TAP purification was performed by sequential IgG affinity and calmodulin affinity columns. Briefly, mitochondria were lysed with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and cleared by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant was further lysed with 1.25% Nonidet P-40, cleared by high speed centrifugation, and loaded on IgG affinity chromatography by binding to Protein A tag. The bound complexes were eluted by tobacco etch virus protease cleavage (N terminus to Protein A tag). Fractions were pooled and purified by calmodulin affinity chromatography by binding to calmodulin-binding peptide tag and eluted with EGTA. Total RNA was extracted from WT and Δpim1 yeasts cultured in YNB medium lacking uracil containing 0.1% dextrose and 2% raffinose to an A600 nm of ∼0.7. We followed the Gary Kobs protocol (75Kobs G. Promega Notes. 68. Promega Corp., Madison, WI2001: 28-29Google Scholar), using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of RNA, using the SuperScript III first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed on a LightCycler®480 system (Roche Applied Science) at the technical platform of the IFR 83 at Université Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6. Each reaction was carried out in 10 μl with 2 μl of cDNA (equivalent to 10 ng of reverse transcribed RNA), 500 nm primer concentration, and 1× LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche Applied Science). Serial dilutions of cDNA (37–3.7 ng) were used to generate a quantitative PCR standard curve. The LightCycler protocol was as follows: 5 min of 95 °C hot start enzyme activation; 40 cycles of 95 °C denaturation for 10 s, 60 °C annealing for 15 s, and 72 °C elongation for 15 s; and melting at 95 °C for 5 s, 65 °C for 60 s, and then heating to 97 °C. Water was used as the template for negative control amplifications included with each PCR run. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed using Roche LightCycler® 480 Software, and CP was calculated by the second derivative maximum method. The amount of the target mRNA was examined and normalized to the RPO21 gene mRNA. The relative expression ratio of a target gene was calculated as described by Pfaffl (24Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25823) Google Scholar), based on real-time PCR efficiencies. Primer pairs are listed in Table 2 and were designed using Probe Finder software (available on-line from Roche Applied Science). The results presented are from three independent experiments (n = 3).TABLE 2Analysis of the expression level of genes of interestGenesPrimers (5′–3′)Expression level in WTExpression level in Δpim1Relative expression Δpim1/WTHSP78CGACGGTAAATTAGACCCTGTC0.84 ± 0.071.54 ± 0.221.83ATTTGAATAGCTCTTGCGATTTCTHSP60GAAGTTGCCTCCAAAACCAA0.89 ± 0.052.15 ± 0.182.41TGGCTCTACCTAAGACAGTAGCAGSOD2AAACCACTGTCTATTCTGGGAAA0.90 ± 0.191.34 ± 0.061.49CTCGTCGATTGCCTTTGCPDB1ATACGGGTTCACAGGTTTGG0.88 ± 0.050.74 ± 0.040.84GCTTGCATAGAGAAATTGAACGLAT1AAAGACCAGTACGAAGGCTCAG0.88 ± 0.050.76 ± 0.080.86GCTGGCGCTTCTTGTTTCTLPD1TTCGTTAAAGGAAATTCCCAAA0.86 ± 0.530.68 ± 0.050.79ACCCATTTCCAATCCGATGCOQ5TTACGCAAGCTCACAGAGCA1.39 ± 0.2441.17 ± 0.170.84GCTGCGGATGATAAAGGACTDLD1TATTTGAGCGACCACGGTTT0.73 ± 0.040.48 ± 0.050.66AACCACCAATCTGTGCACCTALD4CGGGTACGGTCTGGATAAAC1.36 ± 0.291.74 ± 0.221.28AACCCACCGAAAGGAACTGILV5GCCATTGTTGACCAAGGGTA0.73 ± 0.160.64 ± 0.100.88TCCTTGAAGACTGGGGAGAAQCR2GCGGCCTATTTACTCTGTTTGT0.97 ± 0.171.17 ± 0.131.21CCGCAACAATTTTCTTGATGTRIP1TGTGTTCCAATTGGTGAAGC0.85 ± 0.311.35 ± 0.301.59TGAACCATGGCAAGGACAGATP1CTCCTGGTCGTGAAGCCTAC1.17 ± 0.251.17 ± 0.041.00GCGGCTCTTTCTAGCAATCTTATP2TCCGTGGTGAAAAGGTTCTT0.93 ± 0.050.90 ± 0.020.97TCCCTAAAGTTTCTCTCCCAACTMRP20GCCAGAGCAGGTTCCAATAA1.25 ± 0.270.56 ± 0.430.45GCCGCTTTTGTCGAGTATTT Open table in a new tab Mitochondrial fractions were isolated from wild-type and Δpim1 yeast cells cultured in YNB medium lacking uracil containing 0.1% dextrose and 2% raffinose. For isoelectric focusing, mitochondrial protein extracts (300 μg) were resuspended in sample buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 2% (v/v) ampholites (pH 3–10, NL), and 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Aliquots (250 μl) were applied on Immobiline Drystrips (pH 3–10 NL, 13 cm; GE Healthcare), which were then incubated overnight at 20 °C in a reswelling tray (GE Healthcare). Reswelling was followed by protein electrofocusing for 4 h at 300 V, 30 min at 750 V, 30 min at 1500 V, 16 h at 2500 V, and then 2 h at 3500 V, using the Multiphor II system (GE Healthcare). The strips were then equilibrated by incubation for 10 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS) supplemented with 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol and for 10 min in equilibration buffer containing 3% (w/v) iodoacetamide and 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The second dimension consisted of SDS-PAGE in a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, using the Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Gels were running for 16 h at 96 V. Proteins were detected by colloidal blue staining according to the manufacturer (Sigma). Gels were scanned using ImageScanner (GE Healthcare), and protein spots were quantified using ImageMaster 2D Platinum version 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). To account for experimental variations, four independent experiments were performed with independent samples. Isoelectric focusing was performed using 250 μg of mitochondrial protein extracts from wild-type and Δpim1 cells as described above. After the first dimension, strips were frozen at −80 °C for 2 h, and protein carbonyl groups were derivatized; strips were incubated in a solution containing 2 m HCl and 10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (Sigma) for 20 min at 20 °C. The strips were then incubated twice in a solution containing 2 m Tris base and 30% glycerol (v/v) for 20 min each, at 20 °C, and were equilibrated as described above. After the second dimension (as described above), proteins were electrotransferred onto a Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The primary antibody (OxyBlot kit, Millipore) used for immunodetection was raised against dinitrophenylhydrazone. Films were scanned using ImageScanner (GE Healthcare), and protein spots were quantified using ImageMaster 2D Platinum version 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). To account for experimental variations, four independent experiments were performed with independent biological samples. Protein spots were matched on two-dimensional gels and two-dimensional OxyBlots, and quantification was performed using ImageMaster 2D Platinum version 7.0 software (GE Healthcare). For the different experimental conditions (WT or Δpim1), the volume of each spot was quantified and normalized to the total spot volume per gel or per OxyBlot. Thus, we obtained the percentage of volume for each spot. Then we determined protein folds or oxidation folds by calculating the ratio (change) between percentage of volume of spots in Δpim1 compared with WT (Δpim1/WT), respectively, for two-dimensional gels or two-dimensional OxyBlots. The S.D. value was calculated, and statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test among four independent experiments (n = 4). Oxidation indexes were calculated as the ratio between oxidation folds and protein folds, for each spot of interest. Bands or spots of interest were manually excised from one-dimensional gels or two-dimensional gels, washed with deionized water and then twice with 100% acetonitrile for 15 min and 2 min. The gel plugs were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and rehydrated by incubation in 2% trypsin (Promega Corp.) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 4 °C. After 20 min of incubation, the excess trypsin solution was removed, 30 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 was added, and digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 °C overnight. Samples were stored at −20 °C until use. Peptides were desalted on custom-made reverse-phase microcolumns prepared with R2 resin (Perseptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA), as described previously (25Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). A peptide mixture, obtained by trypsin digestions of each spot, was loaded onto the microcolumn, which was then washed with 10 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Bound peptides were eluted with 0.8 μl of matrix solution (5 μg/μl α-cyano-4-hydrocynnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) directly onto the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) target plate. Peptide mass spectra were acquired in positive reflector mode on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer MALDI time-of-flight (TOF)/TOF apparatus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. Each spectrum was obtained with a total of 1000–1200 laser shots and was externally calibrated using peptides derived by digesting β-lactoglobulin with trypsin. Tandem mass spectra were acquired using the same instrument in MS/MS-positive mode. Peak lists were generated from the raw data output by Data Explorer version 4.6 software (Applied Biosystems). MS and MS/MS peak lists were combined into a single search file and used to search the Swiss-Prot data base (release of May 18, 2009) with the Mascot search engine, version 2.2 (Matrix Science, Ltd., London, UK; release of May 18, 2009). The search parameters were as follows: data base, Swiss-Prot; taxonomy, S. cerevisiae; enzyme, trypsin; number of missed cleavages tolerated, 1; fixed modifications, 0; variable modifications, methionine oxidation; peptide mass tolerance, 70 ppm; fragment mass tolerance, 500 ppm. Protein hits with a significant Mascot score (>65) were considered as positively identified. WT and Δpim1 cells were converted to ρ0 mutants by ethidium bromide treatment (26Fox T.D. Folley L.S. Mulero J.J. McMullin T.W. Thorsness P.E. Hedin L.O. Costanzo M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in order to reduce genotypic variability so that WT and Δpim1 cells absolutely display the same defect in mtDNA and that only the presence or absence of Pim1 protease differs between these cells. As a result, WT and Δpim1 cells used in this study are unable to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source, such as glycerol/ethanol (data not shown). Moreover, because one of our goals was to characterize Pim1 functions in mitochondrial biogenesis, cells were grown in raffinose medium. Pim1 processing requires two independent cleavages after mitochondrial import of the precursor to generate a pro-form and a mature form of Pim1, (20Wagner I. van Dyck L. Savel'ev A.S. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7317-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To assess that Pim1 protein is correctly imported and processed into a mature form in ρ0 cell mitochondria, we performed immunoblots of WT and Δpim1 mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 1A). Two distinct bands around 150 kDa were detected from the wild type. Both the pro-form and the mature form are shown to co-purify with mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 1A), suggesting that Pim1 could be recruited to mitochondrial inner membrane. Furthermore, we did not observe any change in the mitochondrial content between WT and Δpim1 cells, as shown by immunoblots of total cell extracts using antibodies against Por1 (mitochondrial porin) or Om45 (a protein of the outer membrane of mitochondria). In order to evaluate the implications of Pim1 in mitochondrial ATP-dependant proteolysis, we analyzed the proteolytic breakdown of casein-fluorescein isothiocyanate by WT or Δpim1 isolated mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteolytic activity was reduced by 35% in Δpim1 cells, thus representing the contribution of Pim1 protease in energy-dependent protein degradation in this organelle. Because the human Lon protease has been shown to degrade oxidized proteins (27Bota D.A. Van Remmen H. Davies K.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Bota D.A. Davies K.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility of a functional conservation in yeast. To determine the level of oxidative damage to proteins, the amount of carbonyl groups was monitored in isolated mitochondria from WT and Δpim1 cells by OxyBlot analysis. Oxidized proteins were found to accumulate at elevated levels in Δpim1 mitochondria (Fig. 1C). Proteomic approaches are well adapted to monitor remodeling of the organellar protein content in response to changes in metabolism or genetic environment. Comparative analyses of mitochondrial oxidized proteomes were performed between WT and Δpim1 cells grown under non-repressing conditions using raffinose as a carbon source to obtain a comprehensive overview of Pim1-mediated protein turnover reactions in mitochondria. Two-dimensional-GE analyses are presented in Fig. 2. Two-dimensional gels were either stained using colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G to detect proteins (Fig. 2, A and B) or were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes to subsequently detect carbonylated proteins using the OxyBlot technique (Fig. 2, C and D). 14 protein spots are more abundant in Δpim1 mitochondria (Fig. 2, A versus B), all of which accumulate as carbonylated proteins (Fig. 2, C versus D). A wide range of proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3 and supplemental Table S1). Hsp60 (heat shock protein 60) and Sod2 (mitochondrial superoxide dismutase)"

Here, we report a method for the isolation of yeast free oligosaccharides (fOSs) using endo-β-1,6-glucanase digestion. fOSs were undetectable in cells lacking PNG1, coding the cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase gene, suggesting that almost all fOSs were formed from misfolded glycoproteins by Png1p. Structural studies revealed that the most abundant fOS was M8B, which is not recognized well by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD)-related lectin, Yos9p. In addition, we provide evidence that some of the ERAD substrates reached the Golgi apparatus prior to retrotranslocation to the cytosol. N-Glycan structures on misfolded glycoproteins in cells lacking the cytosol/vacuole α-mannosidase, Ams1p, was still quite diverse, indicating that processing of N-glycans on misfolded glycoproteins was more complex than currently envisaged. Under ER stress, an increase in fOSs was observed, whereas levels of M7C, a key glycan structure recognized by Yos9p, were unchanged. Our method can thus provide valuable information on the molecular mechanism of glycoprotein ERAD in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 2Lehle L. Strahl S. Tanner W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 6802-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). N-Glycans contribute to the physicochemical properties of core proteins, such as solubility and heat stability, as well as their physiological properties, such as the bioactivity or intra- and intercellular distribution (3Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4962) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies have shown that N-glycans play a pivotal role in the correct folding or degradation of proteins. The former process is called ER quality control, whereas the latter is called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (4Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar).In ER quality control, the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 form of the donor glycan, linked covalently to nascent proteins, is rapidly trimmed by enzymes glucosidases I and II and, in some cases, ER α-mannosidase I, converting it to G1M8–9GN2. Lectin-like molecular chaperones, calnexin/calreticulin, are known to interact with the monoglucosylated glycans and promote the correct folding of nascent glycoproteins (5Ou W.J. Cameron P.H.

Kato A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 570: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, calnexin/calreticulin and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase assist folding of N-glycoproteins (4Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 9Caramelo J.J. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10221-10225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Removal of the remaining glucose by glucosidase II frees the native folded glycoprotein from the lectins. On the other hand, in the ERAD system, N-glycans on misfolded glycoproteins are further trimmed of α-1,2-linked terminal mannose residues by ER α-mannosidase I as well as EDEMs (ER-degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like proteins; Mns1p and Htm1/Mnl1p in yeast, respectively), to generate the M7C form of the glycan (10Olivari S.

It is known that the M7C glycan was then recognized by a degradation sensor lectin, Yos9p, and that this interaction facilitates its ERAD-dependent degradation (13Bhamidipati A. Denic V. Quan E.M. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V. Weibezahn J. Kato K. Weissman J.S. Mol.

The retrotranslocated misfolded glycoproteins are deglycosylated by a cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) (18Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6244-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Deglycosylation by PNGase is known to increase the degradation efficiency of certain ERAD substrates (20Kim I. Ahn J. Liu C. Tanabe K. Apodaca J. Suzuki T. Rao H. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Tanabe K. Lennarz W.J. Suzuki T. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 415: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and the activity of PNGase has been suggested to play a role in the antigen presentation process in mammalian cells (22Kario E.

It is therefore well established that cells dictate subtle structural differences in the N-glycans on nascent glycoproteins to facilitate their folding or degradation. However, the fate of released N-glycans from misfolded glycoproteins, called free oligosaccharides (fOSs), are poorly understood.TABLE 3Free oligosaccharide structures in wild-type and ams1Δ cellsa Glucose unit of each PA-labeled oligosaccharide was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Each fOS amount was based on the peak area of each peak with PA-Glc6 in the PA-glucose oligomer (TaKaRa; 2 pmol/μl) as a reference.c Protein concentration of cell lysates was measured by a BCA assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” N.D., not detected.d Predicted structures of M10G and M6, based on MALDI-TOF MS and various glycosidase digestion analysis.e Amount of M8B/M7C was expressed as a combined sum of M8B/M7C glycans that have GlcNAc or ManNAc in their reducing termini. ManNAc residues were generated by epimerization of the N-acetyl group of reducing end GlcNAc during reductive amination in the PA-labeling process as reported previously (45Suzuki T. Matsuo I. Totani K. Funayama S. Seino J. Taniguchi N. Ito Y. Hase S. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 381: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).It has been reported that fOSs can be released not only from misfolded glycoproteins but also from dolicholpyrophosphate-linked oligosaccharides (Dol-PP-OSs), as depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, respectively (18Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6244-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L.

Funakoshi Y. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Free oligosaccharides generated from Dol-PP-OSs by an unclarified mechanism in the ER lumen are exported from the ER to the cytosol in an ATP-dependent manner (28Moore S.E. Bauvy C. Codogno P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6034-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Haga Y. Totani K. Ito Y. Suzuki T. Glycobiology. 2009; 19: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, fOSs in the cytosol are further trimmed by two enzymes, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase and α-mannosidase (30Kato T. Hatanaka K. Mega T. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31Suzuki T. Hara I. Nakano M. Shigeta M. Nakagawa T. Kondo A. Funakoshi Y. Taniguchi N. Biochem.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9691-9696Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consequently, these organisms contain a great variety of GN2 (bearing di-N-acetylchitobiose at their reducing termini) and GN1 (bearing a single GlcNAc at their reducing termini) forms of fOSs in the cytosol (33Yanagida K. Natsuka S. Hase S. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Iwai K. Mega T. Hase S. J.

Biochem. 1999; 126: 852-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which are then transported to the lysosomes by a putative transporter on the lysosomal membranes (36Saint-Pol A. Bauvy C. Codogno P. Moore S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Saint-Pol A. Codogno P. Moore S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13547-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The presence of fOSs, as well as glycan processing enzymes, has also been shown in Caenorhabditis elegans (38Kato T. Fujita K. Takeuchi M. Kobayashi K. Natsuka S. Ikura K. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Suzuki T. Lennarz W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Kato T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 22080-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but the detailed molecular mechanism of fOS formation/degradation remains unknown. In yeast, previous studies reported the occurrence of fOSs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (41Belard M. Cacan R. Verbert A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chantret I. Moore S.E. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 210-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that were degraded mainly by a cytosol/vacuole α-mannosidase, Ams1p (42Chantret I. Moore S.E. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 210-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, detailed structural determination of fOSs still remains to be determined.FIGURE 1Two generation and processing pathways for fOSs in mammalian cells. A, PNGase-dependent fOS generation and processing pathway. B, fOSs derived from Dol-PP-OS-processing pathways. These fOSs are further processed by cytosol-localized hydorolases, endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and α-mannosidase. P and MP, protein and misfolded protein, respectively. Regions circled by a dotted line indicate processing reactions occurring in the cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To identify the precise structures of fOSs from yeast, we used a method previously applied to analyze them in other organisms (33Yanagida K. Natsuka S. Hase S. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 38Kato T. Fujita K. Takeuchi M. Kobayashi K. Natsuka S. Ikura K. Kumagai H. Yamamoto K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), i.e. pyridylamination (PA) of oligosaccharides followed by HPLC analysis. However, we found that most of the PA-labeled oligosaccharides were not derived from fOSs but from β-1,6-glucans. We therefore treated the PA-oligosaccharide fractions with purified endo-1,6-β-glucanase to successfully isolate the fOSs. By HPLC analysis of the PA-labeled fOSs, we found that yeast cells have a great variety of the GN2 form of fOSs, ranging from Hex5 to Hex12HexNAc2, with various isomeric structures. To our surprise, almost all fOSs in yeast cells were found to be generated from misfolded glycoproteins by Png1p because we did not detect any fOSs in png1Δ cells under our experimental conditions. If Ams1p was deleted, fOSs smaller than Man7GlcNAc2 disappeared, suggesting that Ams1p is the sole enzyme demannosylating the fOSs in the cytosol. A mutant having a defect of Cvt (cytosol-to-vacuole targeting), a pathway required for Ams1p to target to the vacuole, resulted in more pronounced demannosylation of fOSs, clearly indicating that Ams1p can act on fOSs in the cytosol. We further showed that the M8B structure and several N-glycan structures were modified by Golgi-resident mannosyltransferases, and the amount of these Golgi-modified glycans was significantly increased upon DTT-mediated ER stress. In sharp contrast, however, the amount of M7C, presumably a key structure for glycoprotein ERAD substrates to be recognized by Yos9p, did not change. This newly established method to identify fOSs in yeast will be invaluable to provide deeper insight into the mechanism of the glycoprotein ERAD pathway.DISCUSSIONN-Glycosylation is now recognized as one of the most important modification reactions in eukaryotic cells. Explosive progress in glycobiology during the past decade has unveiled most, if not all, of the biosynthetic pathways for N-glycans. However, the mechanisms by which N-glycans are catabolized in cells are relatively unknown (77Suzuki T. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2009; 21: 219-227Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This is especially the case for the metabolism of fOSs. Although the presence of fOSs in various eukaryotes has been detected, the molecular mechanisms behind their formation/degradation have remained largely unknown.In yeast cells, how fOSs are generated, processed, and degraded remained unclear because of the lack of an established method for the isolation of fOSs. In the current study, we successfully established a method for the isolation of fOSs from the cytosol of yeast cells by eliminating β-1,6-glucans, using purified endo-1,6-β-glucanase (Fig. 2). It remains unclear whether extracellular β-1,6-glucans are made in the secretory pathway or at the cell surface (78Lesage G. Bussey H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Our results clearly indicated that at least some of the β-1,6-glucan pools can be observed in the cytosol, and this result may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the biosynthetic pathway for β-1,6-glucans. Alternatively, these cytosolic pools of β-1,6-glucan may represent degradation intermediates, although such a degradation process has not, to the best of our knowledge, been described to date.In higher eukaryotes, it has been reported that there are two types of fOSs: one from misfolded glycoproteins and the other from Dol-PP-OSs (Fig. 1, A and B) (18Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 6244-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Hirsch C. Blom D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Anumula K.R. Spiro R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15274-15282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Suzuki T. Funakoshi Y. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 23: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our data clearly showed that formation of fOSs pooled in the cytosol were exclusively dependent on the activity of Png1p, suggesting that, at least under our experimental conditions, fOSs released from Dol-PP-OSs are not active in yeast. This result was further supported by the observation that no fOS was detected in either mid-log or stationary phase of ams1Δ png1Δ cells (data not shown). The lack of Png1p-independent fOS release was contrasted by the findings of Chantret et al. (52Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicated the occurrence of Png1p-independent fOSs. This seeming discrepancy most likely comes from the difference in fOS isolation methods. Chantret et al. (52Chantret I. Frénoy J.P. Moore S.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 901-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) isolated fOSs from whole cell extracts, whereas we isolated fOSs from the cytosolic fraction. The absence of Png1p-independent glycans in the cytosol is consistent with the fact that they are most likely formed in the lumen of the ER (28Moore S.E. Bauvy C. Codogno P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6034-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). How these Png1p-independent fOSs are catabolized remains unclear.Through our newly established method, we observed that yeast cells generate quite diverse forms of fOSs even in the absence of Ams1p, suggesting that misfolded glycoproteins undergo various types of glycan processing in the lumen prior to retrotranslocation. However, yeast cells do not appear to generate the GN1 form of fOSs, in contrast to higher eukaryotes in which the GN1 form is the major fOS structure (33Yanagida K. Natsuka S. Hase S. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 294-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 34Iwai K. Mega T. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 35Ohashi S. Iwai K. Mega T. Hase S. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 852-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Kato T. Kitamura K. Maeda M. Kimura Y. Katayama T. Ashida H. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22080-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lack of the GN1 form of fOSs in yeast cells is consistent with the fact that the orthologue of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase cannot be found in the yeast genome (32Suzuki T. Yano K. Sugimoto S. Kitajima K. Lennarz W.J. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Emori Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 9691-9696Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the most abundant fOSs in ams1Δ yeast cells is M8B. Recently, a couple of studies have elegantly shown that at least some of the glycoprotein ERAD substrates depend on the activity of Htm1p (EDEM orthologue acting as α-mannosidase)/Yos9p (lectin recognizing α-1,6-mannose exposed by Htm1p action) for their efficient retrotranslocation/degradation by the ERAD pathway (Fig. 7A) (11Clerc S. Hirsch C. Oggier D.M. Deprez P. Jakob C. Sommer T. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V. Weibezahn J. Kato K.

Chem. 2009; 284: 17061-17068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, at least from the glycan profile of fOSs, it can be assumed that the glycans processed by Htm1p (to form M7C glycan) are relatively minor. One plausible explanation for this observation is that only a specific glycan, among the multiple N-glycans on misfolded glycoproteins, may act as a recognition signal for Htm1p/Yos9p-dependent degradation (Fig. 7B). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that a specific N-glycan on multiple glycosylated misfolded model proteins, CPY* and PrA*, functions as a tag for targeting to the ERAD pathway (17Xie W. Kanehara K. Sayeed A. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 80Spear E.D. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that there may be many N-glycosylated substrates that are degraded by the ERAD pathway in an Htm1p-independent manner, as suggested by previous reports (81Vashist S. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 82Fujita M. Yoko-O T. Jigami Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 834-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).FIGURE 7Predicted scheme for overall N-glycan processing on misfolded glycoproteins subjected to ERAD. A, a current model for N-glycan processing in glycoprotein ERAD (14Quan E.M. Kamiya Y. Kamiya D. Denic V. Weibezahn J. Kato K. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 870-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). N-Glycans on misfolded glycoproteins are further trimmed by glucosidases (Gls1p and Gls2p) and mannosidases (Mns1p and Htm1p), which can generate M7C glycan. Yos9p, a lectin-like ERAD component, recognizes the α-1,6-terminal mannose residue of M7C. Several misfolded glycoproteins may traffic between ER and Golgi before their degradation, as depicted by downward arrows. B, hypothetical scheme of N-glycan processing on misfolded glycoproteins, based on our fOS analysis. The numbers (pmol/10 mg protein) on N-glycans are based on fOSs analysis in ams1Δ cells. C, when UPR is induced by DTT, yeast cells facilitate the generation of M8B glycans on misfolded proteins and transport misfolded glycoproteins to the Golgi. Thick arrows indicate pathways up-regulated by UPR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also found that several forms of fOSs were subjected to yeast-specific glycan modification (Table 3). This modification was found to be mediated by a Golgi-resident α-1,6-mannosyltransferase, Och1p, and this Och1p-dependent fOS modification was abolished in och1Δ cells. 3H. Hirayama and T. Suzuki, unpublished observation. It should be noted that all Och1p-modified fOSs, so far detected, did not accept further elongation of α-1,6-linked mannose on Och1p-modified mannose. Because the poly-α-1,6-mannose structure can be found quite commonly in yeast cell surface N-glycoproteins, our result might indicate the presence of an uncharacterized quality control system for misfolded glycoproteins in the Golgi. Such a mechanism might prevent misfolded proteins from proceeding further in the secretory pathway and thereby receiving poly-α-1,6-mannose chains and instead help them to be retrieved to the ER and the ERAD pathway. It has been reported that C. elegans also generates fOSs, possibly modified in the Golgi (40Kato T. Kitamura K. Maeda M. Kimura Y. Katayama T. Ashida H. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22080-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although it remains to be determined whether these Golgi-modified fOSs were from misfolded glycoproteins or, alternatively, from Dol-PP-OS. In sharp contrast, our results clearly demonstrated that Golgi-modified glycans are formed by Png1p and therefore derived from misfolded glycoproteins, which might have traveled from the ER to the Golgi (Fig. 7). This notion is supported by reports that the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of several model misfolded glycoproteins, including CPY*, KHNt, and Gas1*, is important for their efficient degradation by the ERAD pathway (82Fujita M. Yoko-O T. Jigami Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 834-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 83Caldwell S.R. Hill K.J. Cooper A.A. J. Biol.

At this time, the question of whether there is any physiological significance of the modification of misfolded glycoproteins by Och1p remains elusive.Elevated expression of Ams1p at stationary phase (Fig. 5A) was consistent with the observation that the processing of fOSs by Ams1p was more pronounced at stationary phase (Fig. 5B, top). The biological significance of Ams1p up-regulation at stationary phase remains to be determined.In ams1Δ cells, the generation of M5 and M6 forms of fOSs was abolished completely. This result suggested that processing beyond Man7GlcNAc2 glycans was generated solely by Ams1p in yeast. Furthermore, the small amount of fOSs observed in wild-type cells, including M8C, G1M8C, and M7H, was not observed in ams1Δ cells (Table 3). Thus, these fOSs also seem to be produced by Ams1p. We also showed that atg19Δ cells, possessing a defect in Ams1p transport from the cytosol to the vacuole, can process fOSs more efficiently than wild-type cells. This is the first report to unequivocally demonstrate that Ams1p has enzyme activity even without being targeted to the vacuole.It is noteworthy that under DTT stress, the overall amount of fOSs was increased (i.e. indication of the aggravation of overall glycoprotein ERAD), but no change in the amount of M7C was observed (Fig. 6C). Further studies will be required to clarify the detailed mechanism by which DTT affects glycoprotein ERAD in yeast. One potential explanation for this observation is that, upon UPR activation (e.g. DTT treatment), most of the substrates that undergo ERAD follow the Htm1p/Yos9p-independent pathway (Fig. 7C). This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that under the UPR, no up-regulation of Htm1p was observed (86Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar), in sharp contrast to that seen in mammalian cells (87Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K. Yorihuzi T. Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Nagata K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The possibility remains that a yet uncovered, Yos9p-independent glycan recognition pathway could be activated by the UPR, although there is no experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. Alternatively, under harsh conditions, up-regulation of the N-glycan structure-independent ERAD as well as vesicular transport may occur for otherwise Htm1p/Yos9p-dependent substrates to sequester accumulated misfolded (glyco)proteins. Such interplay between ERAD and vesicular transport has been well documented (88Spear E.D. Ng D.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2756-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 89Coughlan C.M.

https://openalex.org/W1986678797,"The OR class insect odorant receptors are ligand-gated ion channels comprised of at least one common subunit (OR83b in Drosophila) and at least one putative odorant-binding subunit. However, little else is known about the molecular details of insect OR architecture. For example, nothing is known about how these receptors bind odorants, greatly limiting efforts to develop insect OR-targeted compounds for the control of insects involved in disease propagation and agricultural damage. Here we identify a portion of a Drosophila OR that is involved in odorant activation of the receptor. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we identified residues 146-150 of OR85b, located at the predicted interface between transmembrane segment 3 (TMS3) and extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), as playing a role in odorant (2-heptanone) activation. We found that occupation of the receptor by the competitive antagonist 2-nonanone protected the receptor from methanethiosulfonate action at position 148, placing this region close to the odorant-binding site. In addition, mutations at positions 142 and 143 within TMS3 altered odorant sensitivity. Our results identify the involvement of the extracellular half of TMS3 in Drosophila OR85b in odorant activation of the receptor. This finding can serve as a starting point for future detailed analysis of the molecular basis for odorant recognition by insect ORs, a novel class of ligand-gated channel."

Recently, the genetic locus encoding biosynthetic enzymes for the iron chelating molecule, staphyloferrin A (SA), was determined. S. aureus synthesizes and secretes SA into its environment to scavenge iron. The membrane-anchored ATP binding cassette-binding protein, HtsA, receives the ferric-chelate for import into the cell. Recently, we determined the apoHtsA crystal structure, the first siderophore receptor from gram-positive bacteria to be structurally characterized. Herein we present the x-ray crystal structure of the HtsA-ferric-SA complex. HtsA adopts a class III binding protein fold composed of separate N- and C-terminal domains bridged by a single alpha-helix. Recombinant HtsA can efficiently sequester ferric-SA from S. aureus culture supernatants where it is bound within the pocket formed between distinct N- and C-terminal domains. A basic patch composed mainly of six Arg residues contact the negatively charged siderophore, securing it within the pocket. The x-ray crystal structures from two different ligand-bound crystal forms were determined. The structures represent the first structural characterization of an endogenous alpha-hydroxycarboxylate-type siderophore-receptor complex. One structure is in an open form similar to apoHtsA, whereas the other is in a more closed conformation. The conformational change is highlighted by isolated movement of three loops within the C-terminal domain, a domain movement unique to known class III binding protein structures."

Although the C-terminal domain of Hv1 is known to be responsible for dimeric architecture of the channel, its role and structure are not known. We report that the full-length Hv1 is mainly localized in intracellular compartment membranes rather than the plasma membrane. Truncation of either the N or C terminus alone or both together revealed that the N-terminal deletion did not alter localization, but deletion of the C terminus either alone or together with the N terminus resulted in expression throughout the cell. These results indicate that the C terminus is essential for Hv1 localization but not the N terminus. In the 2.0 A structure of the C-terminal domain, the two monomers form a dimer via a parallel alpha-helical coiled-coil, in which one chloride ion binds with the Neta atom of Arg(264). A pH-dependent structural change of the protein has been observed, but it remains a dimer irrespective of pH value."

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Sae2 protein and the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex are necessary to remove the covalently attached Spo11 protein from the DNA ends, which are then resected by so far unknown nucleases. Here, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Sae2 Ser-267 by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is required to initiate meiotic DSB resection by allowing Spo11 removal from DSB ends. This finding suggests that Cdk1 activity is required for the processing of Spo11-induced DSBs, thus providing a mechanism for coordinating DSB resection with progression through meiotic prophase. Furthermore, the helicase Sgs1 and the nucleases Exo1 and Dna2 participate in lengthening the 5'-3' resection tracts during meiosis by controlling a step subsequent to Spo11 removal."
https://openalex.org/W1964713456,"In the mammalian brain, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is anchored in cell membranes by a transmembrane protein PRiMA (proline-rich membrane anchor). We present evidence that at least part of the PRiMA-linked AChE is integrated in membrane microdomains called rafts. A significant proportion of PRiMA-linked AChE tetramers from rat brain was recovered in raft fractions; this proportion was markedly higher at low rather than at high concentrations of cold Triton X-100. The detergent-resistant fraction increased during brain development. In NG108-15 neuroblastoma cells transfected with cDNAs encoding AChE(T) and PRiMA, PRiMA-linked G(4) AChE was found in membrane rafts and showed the same sensitivity to cold Triton X-100 extraction as in the brain. The association of PRiMA-linked AChE with rafts was weaker than that of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored G(2) AChE or G(4) Q(N)-H(C)-linked AChE. It was found to depend on the presence of a cholesterol-binding motif, called CRAC (cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus), located at the junction of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of both PRiMA I and II isoforms. The cytoplasmic domain of PRiMA, which differs between PRiMA I and PRiMA II, appeared to play some role in stabilizing the raft localization of G(4) AChE, because the Triton X-100-resistant fraction was smaller with the shorter PRiMA II isoform than that with the longer PRiMA I isoform."

Gas7 (growth arrest-specific gene 7), a new member of the PCH (Pombe Cdc15 homology) protein family, is predominantly expressed in neurons and is required for the maturation of primary cultured Purkinje neurons as well as the neuron-like differentiation of PC12 cells upon nerve growth factor stimulation. We report that Gas7 co-localizes and physically interacts with N-WASP, a key regulator of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, in the cortical region of Gas7-transfected Neuro-2a cells and growth cones of hippocampal neurons. The interaction between Gas7 and N-WASP is mediated by WW-Pro domains, which is unique in the PCH protein family, where most interactions are of the SH3-Pro kind. The interaction contributes to the formation of membrane protrusions and processes by recruiting the Arp2/3 complex in a Cdc42-independent manner. Importantly, specific interaction between Gas7 and N-WASP is required for regular neurite outgrowth of hippocampal neurons. The data demonstrate an essential role of Gas7 through its interaction with N-WASP during neuronal maturation/differentiation."

Here, we report a novel protein, GAP 10, isolated from the gastrolith of the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus and specifically expressed in its gastrolith disc. The encoding gene was cloned by partial sequencing of the protein extracted from the gastrolith matrix. Based on an assembled microarray cDNA chip, GAP 10 transcripts were found to be highly (12-fold) up-regulated in premolt gastrolith disc and significantly down-regulated in the hypodermis at the same molt stage. The deduced protein sequence of GAP 10 lacks chitin-binding domains and does not show homology to known proteins in the GenBank data base. It does, however, have an amino acid composition that has similarity to proteins extracted from invertebrate and ascidian-calcified extracellular matrices. The GAP 10 sequence contains a predicted signal peptide and predicted phosphorylation sites. In addition, the protein is phosphorylated and exhibits calcium-binding ability. Repeated daily injections of GAP 10 double strand RNA to premolt C. quadricarinatus resulted in a prolonged premolt stage and in the development of gastroliths with irregularly rough surfaces. These findings suggest that GAP 10 may be involved in the assembly of the gastrolith chitin-protein-mineral complex, particularly in the deposition of amorphous calcium carbonate."

Here we demonstrate that monomeric, single binding site mutants are completely inactive and that a single site, whether located on domain A or B, is insufficient to impart the antiviral activity. Linking inactive, monomeric proteins in a head-to-head fashion by an intermolecular disulfide bond or by creating an exclusively domain-swapped dimer via a hinge residue deletion restored antiviral activity to levels similar to that of wild type CV-N.

IntroductionPredatory marine cone snails (genus Conus) synthesize a great diversity (>50,000) of neurotoxic peptides commonly referred to as conotoxins. Conotoxins selectively target specific subtypes of receptors or ion channels throughout the nervous system, a characteristic that has lead to wide use of conotoxins in ion channel research and as therapeutic agents (for review see Refs.1Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar and 2Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). It is now well understood that the vast diversity of conotoxins is driven by two major events: gene duplication followed by hypermutation of the mature toxin region (3Olivera B.M. J. Biol.

Posttranslational modifications in Conus generally aid in stabilizing the peptide structure (5Craig A.G. Park M. Fischer W.H. Kang J. Compain P. Piller F.

Conotoxins can be grouped into several superfamilies on the basis of their N-terminal signal sequence and their conserved disulfide framework. Interestingly, despite thousands of different toxin sequences biosynthesized there are only 12–18 structural scaffolds found in vivo, an obscurity recently referred to as the “conotoxin folding puzzle” (10Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Even within the same disulfide scaffold, various conotoxins display an array of folding properties, suggesting that neither the Cys pattern nor the primary amino acid sequence is a key folding determinant in vitro (10Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro folding of conotoxins are emerging (10Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with toxins that are difficult to synthesize chemically often being highly abundant in the snail venom gland (11Bulaj G.

These findings strongly suggest that the three-dimensional structure that conotoxins adopt in vivo is determined by specific interactions with folding enzymes and molecular chaperones.

Hydroxylation of these Pro residues is a common modification in Conus and has recently been reported to affect the oxidative folding properties of several conotoxins including ω-MVIIC, a toxin with very poor in vitro folding yields (18Lopez-Vera E. Walewska A. Skalicky J.J. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1741-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of Pro leads to a 2-fold increase in folding yields, whereas the neurotoxic activity of the toxin is maintained. For the μ-conotoxin GIIIA, the modification enhances bioactivity but does not affect folding. In contrast, Pro hydroxylation impairs activity but improves folding yields in the two α-conotoxins ImI and GI, which naturally contain a conserved Pro residue (18Lopez-Vera E. Walewska A. Skalicky J.J. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1741-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of these bonds, an otherwise slow process that can impede protein folding. A number of proteins have been identified as in vivo (30Stamnes M.A. Shieh B.H.

In the only study reported to date, the effects of the human cytosolic PPIase FKBP-12 on the oxidative folding of the scorpion toxin maurotoxin were evaluated (for sequence see Table 1) (40di Luccio E. Azulay D.O. Fajloun Z. Sandoz G. Mansuelle P. Kharrat R. Fathallah M. Carrega L. Estève E. Rochat H. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 681-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of PPIase accelerated the disappearance of intermediate folding species but does not change the overall folding kinetics of maurotoxin in vitro (40di Luccio E. Azulay D.O. Fajloun Z. Sandoz G. Mansuelle P. Kharrat R. Fathallah M. Carrega L. Estève E. Rochat H. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 681-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To address the paucity of information on conotoxin biosynthesis, the present study aimed to identify enzymes having the potential to assist conotoxin folding in vivo. We hypothesized that given the frequency of peptidylprolyl bonds in conotoxins and their importance for receptor binding, PPIase-mediated cis-trans isomerization of these bonds facilitates oxidative folding during toxin biosynthesis in the ER of Conus. To test this hypothesis we first identified and sequenced several PPIase isoforms in the venom gland of the Australian cone snail, Conus novaehollandiae, and recombinantly expressed functionally active enzymes. We demonstrate that PPIase-mediated isomerization of peptidylprolyl bonds significantly affects the rate of formation of the native disulfide bonds for the μ-conotoxin GIIIA, a peptide with three hydroxyprolines (Hyp) and three disulfide bonds. We further show that an ER-resident PPIase is more active in accelerating the folding of μ-GIIIA when compared with two cytosolic isoforms. This study furthers our knowledge on how cone snails efficiently synthesize such a great diversity of highly structured peptides and may shed light on the fundamental principals of oxidative folding of small cysteine-rich peptides.DISCUSSIONCombining proteomics with targeted cDNA sequencing proved to be a highly successful technique for the discovery of novel proteins in the venom gland of Conus. Sequence information obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and nucleotide sequencing was used for the functional characterization of a group of molecular chaperones, the peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases. This study describes for the first time the presence of multiple PPIase isoforms in the venom gland of Conus and evaluates PPIase-assisted oxidative folding of conotoxins in vitro. Further investigations using this integrated approach of proteomic and molecular analyses will facilitate the identification and characterization of additional venom gland proteins and provide insight into the generation of chemical diversity in Conus.Despite their complex three-dimensional structure, which often comprises multiple disulfide bonds and posttranslational modifications (overview in Refs. 4Buczek O. Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 3067-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar and 57Jakubowski J.A. Kelley W.P. Sweedler J.V. Toxicon. 2006; 47: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), little is known about in vivo folding events in the ER of Conus. To date, the only ER-resident enzymes identified in Conus are γ-carboxylase (58Stanley T.B. Stafford D.W. Olivera B.M. Bandyopadhyay P.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and PDI (14Bulaj G. Buczek O. Goodsell I. Jimenez E.C. Kranski J. Nielsen J.S. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PDI was shown to be one of the major soluble proteins in the venom gland of Conus textile (14Bulaj G. Buczek O. Goodsell I. Jimenez E.C. Kranski J. Nielsen J.S. Garrett J.E. Olivera B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14562-14568Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and Conus amadis (15Gowd K.H. Krishnan K.S. Balaram P.I. Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 554-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and oxidative folding studies show PDI-assisted folding of a number of conotoxins in vitro including μ-GIIIA (13Wang Z.Q. Han Y.H. Shao X.X. Chi C.W. Guo Z.Y. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4778-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 47Fuller E. Green B.R. Catlin P. Buczek O. Nielsen J.S. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the venom gland proteome confirmed high abundances of this enzyme in the venom gland of C. novaehollandiae (Fig. 1A). As shown for a number of proline-containing proteins including ribonuclease T1, PPIase can improve the efficiency of PDI-mediated folding by providing partially folded protein chains with the correct proline isomers (56Schönbrunner E.R. Schmid F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4510-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As folding intermediates are highly susceptible to degradation, accelerating the time needed from translation at the ribosome to generation of the protein in its final three-dimensional structure is energetically advantageous. The epithelial cells of the venom gland are highly specialized in peptide biosynthesis and secretion and energetically rely upon fast turnover rates.Here, we have shown that Conus PPIases can significantly accelerate the formation of the native disulfide bonds for conotoxin μ-GIIIA, revealing that peptidylprolyl isomerization is a rate-limiting step in the oxidative folding of this conotoxin. The native peptide containing three disulfide bonds appeared ∼6 times faster in the presence of PPI B. Concomitantly, both the disappearance of the linear form and the appearance and subsequent disappearance of other folding species were accelerated when Conus PPI B was added to the folding reaction (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Changes in the folding kinetics followed in a concentration-dependent manner with 10-fold higher folding rates for GIIIA in the presence of 2.5 μm PPI B (Fig. 9). No difference in GIIIA folding was observed when heat-treated enzyme was added to the folding reaction (data not shown).As all three prolines in μ-GIIIA are posttranslationally modified, we have further demonstrated that a 4-hydroxyproline-containing conotoxin can be recognized by Conus PPIase, a finding reported previously for collagen (19Steinmann B. Bruckner P. Superti-Furga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1299-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17144-17148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of prolines is believed to be catalyzed by prolyl 4-hydroxylase. Interestingly, PDI is a subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and hydroxylation, formation of the native disulfide bonds, and cis-trans isomerization of Hyp residues may occur concurrently. Recently a complex comprising prolyl 3-hydroxylase-1, cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), and cyclophilin B was identified in chick embryos and shown to act as a chaperone for collagen (60Ishikawa Y. Wirz J. Vranka J.A. Nagata K. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17641-17647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similar complexes might be present in the ER of Conus, and their discovery would contribute greatly to our knowledge of the biosynthesis of conotoxins and other disulfide-rich small peptides.Mature GIIIA is 22 amino acids in length and contains three Hyp residues in position 6, 7, and 17 (Table 2). NMR studies on GIIIA and its paralogue, GIIIB, strongly suggest a trans configuration of Hyp6 and Hyp17, whereas Hyp7 adopts a cis conformation (54Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 55Lancelin J.M. Kohda D. Tate S. Yanagawa Y. Abe T. Satake M. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6908-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Under unstrained conditions, e.g. during translation at the ribosomes, most prolyl peptide bonds adopt a trans configuration (61Balbach J. Schmid F.X. Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000: 212-249Google Scholar). Therefore, for proteins containing both cis and trans prolines, the folding kinetics are driven by the trans-to-cis isomerization, and the contribution of the trans prolines can be neglected (39Schindler T. Mayr L.M. Landt O. Hahn U. Schmid F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 516-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As a consequence, cis-Pro7 is likely to dominate the folding kinetics of GIIIA. However, slow intermediate trans-to-cis isomerizations of Pro6 and Pro17 during formation and/or reshuffling of disulfide bonds cannot be ruled out.The presence of PPIase did not affect the folding kinetics of ω-MVIIC and μ-SIIIA under the various conditions tested. The inability of Conus PPIs to accelerate the folding of SIIIA is not surprising, as this peptide does not contain Pro or Hyp residues. MVIIC is a ω-conotoxin with one Pro/Hyp residue likely to be present as mixed cis/trans isomers (18Lopez-Vera E. Walewska A. Skalicky J.J. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1741-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Isomerization of the Pro/Hyp residue might not represent a rate-limiting step in the oxidative folding of MVIIC. Alternatively, MVIIC may not represent a suitable substrate for Conus PPIases. Both MVIIC and GIIIA comprise three disulfide bonds, are similar in length, and have comparable charge states at pH 7.5 (pH +4.2 for GIIIA and +5.2 for MVIIC). Studies addressing the substrate specificities of the PPIases of the cyclophilin family reveal the broad specificities of these enzymes (62Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3813-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 63Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3464-3471Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, short tetrapeptides were the only substrates tested in these studies (62Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3813-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 63Harrison R.K. Stein R.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 3464-3471Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and differences in substrate recognition and affinity between GIIIA and MVIIC cannot be excluded, especially considering the significant differences in their disulfide patterns and primary amino acid sequences (see Table 2). Future studies using a variety of conotoxins with sequence similarities to GIIIA and MVIIC will shed light on substrate specificities of Conus PPIases.RT-PCR on the venom gland, bulb, and muscle tissue revealed high expression levels of the ER-resident isoform PPI B in the venom gland of C. novaehollandiae (Fig. 4). As opposed to the bulb and the muscle, the venom gland is highly specialized for toxin biosynthesis, and up-regulation of PPI B strongly indicates a predominant role of this isoform in protein/peptide folding as reported for the human ER-resident PPIases CypB and FKBP-13 (36Kim J. Choi T.G. Ding Y. Kim Y. Ha K.S. Lee K.H. Kang I. Ha J. Kaufman R.J. Lee J. Choe W. Kim S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3636-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 37Bush K.T. Hendrickson B.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Conus PPI B is approximately five times more efficient in accelerating the folding of GIIIA than the two cytosolic isoforms, PPI A (I) and A (II) (Fig. 10), but is less active in catalyzing the isomerization of the tetrapeptide Suc-AAPF-pNA (Fig. 6). These findings indicate a potential and specialized role of PPI B in the in vivo folding of conotoxins. Differences in catalytic efficacy between the A and B isoform have previously been reported for the trematode Schistosoma mansoni (64Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and recently for human cyclophilins (65Hanoulle X. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Verdegem D. Landrieu I. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13589-13601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human CypA and CypB both recognize several proline residues on domain 2 of hepatitis C virus NS5A protein but with different catalytic efficiencies (65Hanoulle X. Badillo A. Wieruszeski J.M. Verdegem D. Landrieu I. Bartenschlager R. Penin F. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13589-13601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). For S. mansoni recombinant CypB was two to three times more active than CypA when tested against Suc-AAPF-pNA. As for Conus PPI A (I + II) and B, the amino acid residues important for substrate binding were highly conserved between the two isoforms with the only difference being the presence of serine 103 in PPIase B instead of the conserved alanine 103 for the A isoform. Although the authors (64Bugli F. Khattab A. Vigneti E. Butler R. Cioli D. Klinkert M.Q. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 12: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) suggested that this amino acid replacement might cause the differences in substrate binding affinities, later studies demonstrated that the cytosolic A isoform can adopt two redox states, significantly impairing the enzyme activity (66Gourlay L.J. Angelucci F. Baiocco P. Boumis G. Brunori M. Bellelli A. Miele A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24851-24857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Under oxidizing conditions S. mansoni PPI A exhibits one disulfide bond, leading to a significant change in the binding pocket of the enzyme, thus impeding activity. A similar observation was made for cyclophilin CYP20–3 isolated from the chloroplasts of Arabidopsis thaliana (67Laxa M. König J. Dietz K.J. Kandlbinder A. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 68Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 34: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CYP20-3, believed to be regulated by thioredoxin (68Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 34: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (116) Google Scholar), comprises two disulfide bonds in its oxidized, inactive state (67Laxa M. König J. Dietz K.J. Kandlbinder A. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Conus PPI A (I) and (II) contain four cysteines in their primary amino acid sequence (Fig. 2). Formation of disulfide bonds between these cysteine residues may occur especially under the oxidizing conditions necessary for the conotoxin folding experiments. Only one cysteine remains conserved in the ER-resident Conus PPIase (Fig. 2), implying a potential adaptation of this isoform to the oxidizing conditions in the ER. Structural studies on the different PPIase isoforms under oxidizing and reducing conditions and in complex with Suc-AAPF-pNA, μ-GIIIA, and other potential conotoxin substrates will provide insight into the existence of redox states, differences in enzyme activities, and substrate recognition properties.In summary, this study has identified the first members of the PPIase family in marine cone snails, animals that specialize in the biosynthesis of cysteine-rich peptides. We have demonstrated that a venom gland ER-resident isoform preferentially catalyzes the refolding of a conotoxin that contains three hydroxyprolines. These observations suggest that this isoform may have co-evolved with the toxin arsenal to efficiently produce the diverse venom repertoire of the Conus species. It is anticipated that Conus PPlases may act in concert with other foldases, such as PDI and prolyl 4-hydroxylase, to facilitate conotoxin biosynthesis. The characterization of these enzymes provides insights into the fundamental process of the folding of toxins and related polypeptides as well as having potential industrial application to the large scale production of toxins as therapeutics. IntroductionPredatory marine cone snails (genus Conus) synthesize a great diversity (>50,000) of neurotoxic peptides commonly referred to as conotoxins. Conotoxins selectively target specific subtypes of receptors or ion channels throughout the nervous system, a characteristic that has lead to wide use of conotoxins in ion channel research and as therapeutic agents (for review see Refs.1Olivera B.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2101-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar and 2Terlau H. Olivera B.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 41-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). It is now well understood that the vast diversity of conotoxins is driven by two major events: gene duplication followed by hypermutation of the mature toxin region (3Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31173-31177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and the generation of posttranslational modifications (for review see Ref. 4Buczek O. Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 3067-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications in Conus generally aid in stabilizing the peptide structure (5Craig A.G. Park M. Fischer W.H. Kang J. Compain P. Piller F. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6Loughnan M.L. Nicke A. Jones A. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1234-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as varying the structure and shape of the peptide to optimize target binding (7Mann M. Jensen O.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar, 8Pisarewicz K. Mora D. Pflueger F.C. Fields G.B. Marí F. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2005; 6: 4247-4253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar).The most common posttranslational modification is the formation of disulfide bonds, a characteristic shared with neurotoxins from other venomous animals, antimicrobial peptides such as the defensins, and peptide proteinase inhibitors (Table 1). Conotoxins can be grouped into several superfamilies on the basis of their N-terminal signal sequence and their conserved disulfide framework. Interestingly, despite thousands of different toxin sequences biosynthesized there are only 12–18 structural scaffolds found in vivo, an obscurity recently referred to as the “conotoxin folding puzzle” (10Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Even within the same disulfide scaffold, various conotoxins display an array of folding properties, suggesting that neither the Cys pattern nor the primary amino acid sequence is a key folding determinant in vitro (10Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro folding of conotoxins are emerging (10Bulaj G. Olivera B.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), with toxins that are difficult to synthesize chemically often being highly abundant in the snail venom gland (11Bulaj G. Zhang M.M. Green B.R. Fiedler B. Layer R.T. Wei S. Nielsen J.S. Low S.J. Klein B.D. Wagstaff J.D. Chicoine L. Harty T.P. Terlau H. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M.

These findings strongly suggest that the three-dimensional structure that conotoxins adopt in vivo is determined by specific interactions with folding enzymes and molecular chaperones. One apparent folding catalyst in the biosynthesis of cysteine-rich peptides is protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI). 2The abbreviations used are: PDIprotein-disulfide isomeraseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidCypcyclophilinERendoplasmic reticulumHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyIEFisoelectric focusingLCliquid chromatographyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMS/MStandem mass spectroscopypNAp-nitroanilidePPIasepeptidylprolyl cis-trans isomeraseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRTreverse transcriptaseSucsuccinyl. The oxidation and isomerization of disulfide bonds in the ER of Conus are now known to be catalyzed by PDI (13Wang Z.Q. Han Y.H. Shao X.X. Chi C.W. Guo Z.Y. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 4778-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), one of the most abundant soluble proteins in the venom gland of Conus (14Bulaj G. Buczek O. Goodsell I. Jimenez E.C.

Biosyst. 2007; 3: 554-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Given the structural complexity of conotoxins, mechanisms other than PDI-mediated folding are likely to occur.TABLE 1Diversity of proline/hydroxyproline-containing disulfide-rich peptides Open table in a new tab A great number of conotoxins comprise one or more proline (Pro) residues, some of which are important for toxin-target interactions (16Armishaw C.

Hydroxylation of these Pro residues is a common modification in Conus and has recently been reported to affect the oxidative folding properties of several conotoxins including ω-MVIIC, a toxin with very poor in vitro folding yields (18Lopez-Vera E. Walewska A. Skalicky J.J. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1741-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Hydroxylation of Pro leads to a 2-fold increase in folding yields, whereas the neurotoxic activity of the toxin is maintained. For the μ-conotoxin GIIIA, the modification enhances bioactivity but does not affect folding. In contrast, Pro hydroxylation impairs activity but improves folding yields in the two α-conotoxins ImI and GI, which naturally contain a conserved Pro residue (18Lopez-Vera E. Walewska A. Skalicky J.J. Olivera B.M. Bulaj G. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1741-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These findings emphasize the importance of Pro hydroxylation in the structure and bioactivity of conotoxins. Hydroxylation of Pro has been reported for a number of proteins including collagen, a well studied substrate of the enzyme peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) (19Steinmann B. Bruckner P.

Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1313-1347Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Today the terms PPIases, cyclophilins (Cyp), and immunophilins are often used synonymously. Genome analysis of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified at least eight different isoforms (23Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Wu X. Hanes S.D. Heitman J. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2420-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), none of which are essential for its survival (24Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).

In the only study reported to date, the effects of the human cytosolic PPIase FKBP-12 on the oxidative folding of the scorpion toxin maurotoxin were evaluated (for sequence see Table 1) (40di Luccio E. Azulay D.O. Fajloun Z. Sandoz G. Mansuelle P. Kharrat R. Fathallah M. Carrega L. Estève E. Rochat H. De Waard M. Sabatier J.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 681-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of PPIase accelerated the disappearance of intermediate folding species but does not change the overall folding kinetics of maurotoxin in vitro (40di Luccio E. Azulay D.O. Fajloun Z.

J. 2001; 358: 681-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To address the paucity of information on conotoxin biosynthesis, the present study aimed to identify enzymes having the potential to assist conotoxin folding in vivo. We hypothesized that given the frequency of peptidylprolyl bonds in conotoxins and their importance for receptor binding, PPIase-mediated cis-trans isomerization of these bonds facilitates oxidative folding during toxin biosynthesis in the ER of Conus. To test this hypothesis we first identified and sequenced several PPIase isoforms in the venom gland of the Australian cone snail, Conus novaehollandiae, and recombinantly expressed functionally active enzymes. We demonstrate that PPIase-mediated isomerization of peptidylprolyl bonds significantly affects the rate of formation of the native disulfide bonds for the μ-conotoxin GIIIA, a peptide with three hydroxyprolines (Hyp) and three disulfide bonds. We further show that an ER-resident PPIase is more active in accelerating the folding of μ-GIIIA when compared with two cytosolic isoforms. This study furthers our knowledge on how cone snails efficiently synthesize such a great diversity of highly structured peptides and may shed light on the fundamental principals of oxidative folding of small cysteine-rich peptides."

The Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus is composed of three structural proteins, RrgA, RrgB, and RrgC and three transpeptidase enzymes, sortases SrtC-1, SrtC-2, and SrtC-3. To gain insights into the mechanism of pilus formation we have exploited biochemical approaches using recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Using site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, limited proteolysis, and thermal stability measurements, we have identified isopeptide bonds in RrgB and RrgC and demonstrate their role in protein stabilization. Co-expression in E. coli of RrgB together with RrgC and SrtC-1 leads to the formation of a covalent RrgB-RrgC complex. Inactivation of SrtC-1 by mutation of the active site cysteine impairs RrgB-RrgC complex formation, indicating that the association between RrgB and RrgC is specifically catalyzed by SrtC-1. Mass spectrometry analyses performed on purified samples of the RrgB-RrgC complex show that the complex has 1:1 stoichiometry. The deletion of the IPQTG RrgB sorting signal, but not the corresponding sequence in RrgC, abolishes complex formation, indicating that SrtC-1 recognizes exclusively the sorting motif of RrgB. Finally, we show that the intramolecular bonds that stabilize RrgB may play a role in its efficient recognition by SrtC-1. The development of a methodology to generate covalent pilin complexes in vitro, facilitating the study of sortase specificity and the importance of isopeptide bond formation for pilus biogenesis, provide key information toward the understanding of this complex macromolecular process."
https://openalex.org/W2071699219,"The proto-oncogenic Ras isoforms (H, N, and K) have a C-terminal CAAX motif and undergo the same post-translational processing steps, although they traffic to the plasma membrane through different routes. Previously, we have shown that overexpression of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP17 inhibits H-Ras localization to the plasma membrane. Now we report that whereas H-Ras and N-Ras were unable to localize to the plasma membrane in the presence of USP17, K-Ras4b localization was unaffected. EGF stimulation was unable to induce N-Ras membrane localization in USP17-expressing cells. In addition, N-Ras activity and downstream signaling through the MAPK MEK/ERK and PI3K/JNK pathways were blunted. However, we still detected abundant N-Ras localization at the ER and Golgi in USP17-expressing cells. Collectively, our data showed that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP17 blocks EGF-induced N-Ras membrane trafficking and activation, but left K-Ras unaffected."

https://openalex.org/W2093232709,"DeltaF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) degradation involves ubiquitin modification and efficient proteasomal targeting of the nascent misfolded protein. We show that a deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), is highly expressed in cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesized that the elevation in UCH-L1 in CF cells represents a cellular adaptation to counterbalance excessive proteasomal degradation. The bronchial epithelial cell lines IB3-1 (CF, high UCH-L1 expression) and S9 (non-CF, low UCH-L1 expression) were transiently transfected with wild type (WT) or DeltaF508 CFTR, WT UCH-L1 or small interfering RNA-UCH-L1, and a variety of ubiquitin mutants. We observed a positive correlation between UCH-L1 expression and steady state levels of WT- or DeltaF508-CFTR, and this stabilizing effect was confined to the early stages of CFTR synthesis. Immunolocalization of UCH-L1 by confocal microscopy revealed a partial co-localization with a ribosomal subunit and the endoplasmic reticulum. The UCH-L1-associated increase in CFTR levels was correlated with an increase in ubiquitinated CFTR (CFTR-Ub). Co-transfection with mutant ubiquitins and treatment with proteasome inhibitors suggested that UCH-L1 was reducing the proteasomal targeting of CFTR during synthesis by shortening conjugated polyubiquitin chains. Although not sufficient by itself to rescue mutant CFTR therapeutically, the elevation of UCH-L1 and its effect on CFTR processing provides insight into its potential roles in CF and other diseases."
