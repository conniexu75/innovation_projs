https://openalex.org/W2161092951,"Many adult regenerative cells divide infrequently but have high proliferative capacity. We developed a strategy to fluorescently label slow-cycling cells in a cell type-specific fashion. We used this method to purify the label-retaining cells (LRCs) that mark the skin stem cell (SC) niche. We found that these cells rarely divide within their niche but change properties abruptly when stimulated to exit. We determined their transcriptional profile, which, when compared to progeny and other SCs, defines the niche. Many of the >100 messenger RNAs preferentially expressed in the niche encode surface receptors and secreted proteins, enabling LRCs to signal and respond to their environment."
https://openalex.org/W2000004737,"A global map of gene expression within an organ can identify genes with coordinated expression in localized domains, thereby relating gene activity to cell fate and tissue specialization. Here, we present localization of expression of more than 22,000 genes in the Arabidopsis root. Gene expression was mapped to 15 different zones of the root that correspond to cell types and tissues at progressive developmental stages. Patterns of gene expression traverse traditional anatomical boundaries and show cassettes of hormonal response. Chromosomal clustering defined some coregulated genes. This expression map correlates groups of genes to specific cell fates and should serve to guide reverse genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2030216833,"Plants use ethylene gas as a signal to regulate myriad developmental processes and stress responses. The Arabidopsis EIN3 protein is a key transcription factor mediating ethylene-regulated gene expression and morphological responses. Here, we report that EIN3 protein levels rapidly increase in response to ethylene and this response requires several ethylene-signaling pathway components including the ethylene receptors (ETR1 and EIN4), CTR1, EIN2, EIN5, and EIN6. In the absence of ethylene, EIN3 is quickly degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway mediated by two F box proteins, EBF1 and EBF2. Plants containing mutations in either gene show enhanced ethylene response by stabilizing EIN3, whereas efb1 efb2 double mutants show constitutive ethylene phenotypes. Plants overexpressing either F box gene display ethylene insensitivity and destabilization of EIN3 protein. These results reveal that a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway negatively regulates ethylene responses by targeting EIN3 for degradation, and pinpoint EIN3 regulation as the key step in the response to ethylene."
https://openalex.org/W1987583896,"The initiation of X-chromosome inactivation is thought to be tightly correlated with early differentiation events during mouse development. Here, we show that although initially active, the paternal X chromosome undergoes imprinted inactivation from the cleavage stages, well before cellular differentiation. A reversal of the inactive state, with a loss of epigenetic marks such as histone modifications and polycomb proteins, subsequently occurs in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM), which give rise to the embryo-proper in which random X inactivation is known to occur. This reveals the remarkable plasticity of the X-inactivation process during preimplantation development and underlines the importance of the ICM in global reprogramming of epigenetic marks in the early embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2050745715,"Although Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination is essential for both degradation and nuclear export of p53, the molecular basis for the differential effects of Mdm2 remains unknown. Here we show that low levels of Mdm2 activity induce monoubiquitination and nuclear export of p53, whereas high levels promote p53's polyubiquitination and nuclear degradation. A p53-ubiquitin fusion protein that mimics monoubiquitinated p53 was found to accumulate in the cytoplasm in an Mdm2-independent manner, indicating that monoubiquitination is critical for p53 trafficking. These results clarify the nature of ubiquitination-mediated p53 regulation and suggest that distinct mechanisms regulate p53 function in accordance with the levels of Mdm2 activity."
https://openalex.org/W2171373304,"The neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by microsatellite repeat expansions at two different genomic loci. Mutant DM transcripts are retained in the nucleus together with the muscleblind (Mbnl) proteins, and these abnormal RNAs somehow interfere with pre-mRNA splicing regulation. Here, we show that disruption of the mouse Mbnl1 gene leads to muscle, eye, and RNA splicing abnormalities that are characteristic of DM disease. Our results support the hypothesis that manifestations of DM can result from sequestration of specific RNA binding proteins by a repetitive element expansion in a mutant RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1991308916,"Cells exposed to low oxygen concentrations respond by initiating defense mechanisms, including the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha, a transcription factor that upregulates genes such as those involved in glycolysis and angiogenesis. Nitric oxide and other inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration prevent the stabilization of HIF1alpha during hypoxia. In studies of cultured cells, we show that this effect is a result of an increase in prolyl hydroxylase-dependent degradation of HIF1alpha. With the use of Renilla luciferase to detect intracellular oxygen concentrations, we also demonstrate that, upon inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in hypoxia, oxygen is redistributed toward nonrespiratory oxygen-dependent targets such as prolyl hydroxylases so that they do not register hypoxia. Thus, the signaling consequences of hypoxia may be profoundly modified by nitric oxide."
https://openalex.org/W2118215239,"The complete genome sequence of Geobacter sulfurreducens, a delta-proteobacterium, reveals unsuspected capabilities, including evidence of aerobic metabolism, one-carbon and complex carbon metabolism, motility, and chemotactic behavior. These characteristics, coupled with the possession of many two-component sensors and many c-type cytochromes, reveal an ability to create alternative, redundant, electron transport networks and offer insights into the process of metal ion reduction in subsurface environments. As well as playing roles in the global cycling of metals and carbon, this organism clearly has the potential for use in bioremediation of radioactive metals and in the generation of electricity."
https://openalex.org/W2012356760,"The plant hormone ethylene regulates a wide range of developmental processes and the response of plants to stress and pathogens. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis led to a partial elucidation of the mechanisms of ethylene action. Ethylene signal transduction initiates with ethylene binding at a family of ethylene receptors and terminates in a transcription cascade involving the EIN3/EIL and ERF families of plant-specific transcription factors. Here, we identify two Arabidopsis F box proteins called EBF1 and EBF2 that interact physically with EIN3/EIL transcription factors. EBF1 overexpression results in plants insensitive to ethylene. In contrast, plants carrying the ebf1 and ebf2 mutations display a constitutive ethylene response and accumulate the EIN3 protein in the absence of the hormone. Our work places EBF1 and EBF2 within the genetic framework of the ethylene-response pathway and supports a model in which ethylene action depends on EIN3 protein stabilization."
https://openalex.org/W2152893165,"The crystal structure at 4.8 angstrom resolution of the reaction center–light harvesting 1 (RC–LH1) core complex from Rhodopseudomonas palustris shows the reaction center surrounded by an oval LH1 complex that consists of 15 pairs of transmembrane helical α- and β-apoproteins and their coordinated bacteriochlorophylls. Complete closure of the RC by the LH1 is prevented by a single transmembrane helix, out of register with the array of inner LH1 α-apoproteins. This break, located next to the binding site in the reaction center for the secondary electron acceptor ubiquinone (UQ B ), may provide a portal through which UQ B can transfer electrons to cytochrome b/c 1 ."
https://openalex.org/W1989184804,"Commissural neurons in the mammalian dorsal spinal cord send axons ventrally toward the floor plate, where they cross the midline and turn anteriorly toward the brain; a gradient of chemoattractant(s) inside the spinal cord controls this turning. In rodents, several Wnt proteins stimulate the extension of commissural axons after midline crossing (postcrossing). We found that Wnt4 messenger RNA is expressed in a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient in the floor plate, and that a directed source of Wnt4 protein attracted postcrossing commissural axons. Commissural axons in mice lacking the Wnt receptor Frizzled3 displayed anterior-posterior guidance defects after midline crossing. Thus, Wnt-Frizzled signaling guides commissural axons along the anterior-posterior axis of the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2159586303,"The production of nitric oxide and other reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) by macrophages helps to control infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ). However, the protection is imperfect and infection persists. To identify genes that Mtb requires to resist RNI, we screened 10,100 Mtb transposon mutants for hypersusceptibility to acidified nitrite. We found 12 mutants with insertions in seven genes representing six pathways, including the repair of DNA ( uvrB ) and the synthesis of a flavin cofactor ( fbiC ). Five mutants had insertions in proteasome-associated genes. An Mtb mutant deficient in a presumptive proteasomal adenosine triphosphatase was attenuated in mice, and exposure to proteasomal protease inhibitors markedly sensitized wild-type Mtb to RNI. Thus, the mycobacterial proteasome serves as a defense against oxidative or nitrosative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2157903759,"Galectin-3 is unique among the galectin family of animal lectins in its biological activities and structure. Most members of the galectin family including galectin-1 possess apoptotic activities, whereas galectin-3 possesses anti-apoptotic activity. Galectin-3 is also the only chimera type galectin and consists of a nonlectin N-terminal domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain. Recent sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies show that murine galectin-3 is a monomer in the absence and presence of LacNAc, a monovalent sugar. However, quantitative precipitation studies in the present report indicate that galectin-3 precipitates as a pentamer with a series of divalent pentasaccharides with terminal LacNAc residues. Furthermore, the kinetics of precipitation are fast, on the order of seconds. This indicates that although the majority of galectin-3 in solution is a monomer, a rapid equilibrium exists between the monomer and a small percentage of pentamer. The latter, in turn, precipitates with the divalent oligosaccharides, resulting in rapid conversion of monomer to pentamer by mass action equilibria. Mixed quantitative precipitation experiments and electron microscopy suggest that galectin-3 forms heterogenous, disorganized cross-linking complexes with the multivalent carbohydrates. This contrasts with galectin-1 and many plant lectins that form homogeneous, organized cross-linked complexes. The results are discussed in terms of the biological properties of galectin-3.

The amino acid sequence of galectin-3 varies from 243 to 286 amino acids depending on the number of tandem repeats of a peptide sequence rich in proline, glycine, and tyrosine residues in the N-terminal domain, which is species-dependent (5Cooper D.N.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 209-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In the mammalian protein, there is also a conserved 18-amino acid N-terminal peptide sequence preceding the proline/glycine/tyrosine-rich repetitive domain that appears to have its own functions (5Cooper D.N.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 209-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The C-terminal CRD domain of galectin-3 is homologous to that of galectin-1 and other members of the galectin family (5Cooper D.N.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Galectin-3 shows significant homology with the Bcl-2 class of proteins, and like Bcl-2, galectin-3 possesses anti-apoptotic activity in a variety of cells (23Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Liu F.-T. Proc. Natl.

Rubinstein N. Toscano M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Because many of the biological properties of galectin-3 depend on its carbohydrate recognition properties (5Cooper D.N.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 209-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), it is important to understand its mechanism(s) of binding to cellular carbohydrates.The x-ray crystal structure of the CRD of galectin-3 has been reported (7Seetharaman J.

The CRD alone binds lactose but lacks the hemagglutination activity and cooperative binding associated with intact galectin-3 (25Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14167-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggest that the N-terminal domain is important for aggregation of the protein. Indeed purified N-terminal fragments have been found to self-associate (26Mehul B. Bawumia S. Martin S.R. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18250-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence that galectin-3 self-associates in the absence of saccharides was reported using chemical cross-linking experiments (25Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.-T. J. Biol.

Carmi P. Raz A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, the hemagglutination activity (29Frigeri L.G. Robertson M.W. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20763-20769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cooperative binding of galectin-3 to immobilized IgE (25Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.-T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) also suggest that the lectin exists as an oligomer in the presence of a multivalent glycoconjugate. However, gel filtration studies failed to detect an oligomeric form of the lectin (25Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14167-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Massa S.M. Cooper D.N.W. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). More recently, the quaternary structure of recombinant murine galectin-3 in solution was directly determined by sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements, and the results show that the lectin is predominantly a monomer (31Morris S. Ahmad N. Andre S. Kaltner H. Gabius H.-J. Brenowitz M. Brewer F. Glycobiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, to date there is no clear understanding of the relationship between the quaternary structure of galectin-3 and its multivalent carbohydrate binding properties.In the present study, quantitative precipitation, electron microscopy, and kinetic data have been obtained for binding and precipitation of murine recombinant galectin-3 with a series of divalent carbohydrates possessing terminal LacNAc residues. Quantitative precipitation studies indicate that the lectin precipitates as a pentamer in the presence of the divalent carbohydrates in Fig. 1 and that the kinetics of precipitation are fast. These observations suggests that a small amount of protein oligomer is in rapid equilibrium with the predominant monomer in solution and that mass action equilibria quickly convert the monomer to pentamer, which precipitates with the carbohydrates. Mixed quantitative precipitation experiments indicate that galectin-3 forms heterogeneous cross-linked complexes with the carbohydrates, and electron microscopy suggests that these complexes are structurally disorganized. These findings provide important new insights into the structure-activity properties of galectin-3.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fetuin and lactose were obtained from Sigma. Asialofetuin was prepared from fetuin by desialylation and purified as described earlier (32Gupta D. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5526-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Asialofetuin-Sepharose was prepared by following a published procedure (33Parikh I. March S. Cuatercasas P. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 34: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Synthesis of the pentasaccharides in Fig. 1 have been reported (34Sabesan S. Duus J.O. Neira S. Domaille P. Kelm S. Paulson J.C. Bock K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 8363-8375Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The structures and purity of carbohydrates were established by 1H NMR spectroscopy. All other reagents were of analytical grade.Galectin Preparations—The plasmid prCBP35s with cDNA for murine galectin-3 was a gift from John L. Wang (East Lansing), and the protein was expressed as described in the literature (35Agrwal N. Sun Q. Wang S.-Y. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14932-14939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein showed a single band by SDS-PAGE. Galectin-3 batches were found to have different n values by isothermal titration microcalorimetry using LacNAc as a ligand. Therefore, each batch of galectin-3 was subjected to several affinity chromatography cycles on an ASF-Sepharose until an n value of 1 was achieved by isothermal titration microcalorimetry.Monomeric galectin-3 concentrations were determined spectrophoto-metrically at 280 nm using the specific extinction coefficient of 6.1 ( E1cm1%) for galectin-3 (36Ahmad N. Gabius H.-J. Kaltner H. Andre S. Kuwahara I. Liu F.-T. Oscarson S. Norberg T. Brewer C.F. Can. J. Chem. 2002; 80: 1096-1104Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Molecular mass of galectin-3 was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and was found to be 27,500 Da.Quantitative Precipitation Analysis—The pentasaccharides used in the present study were dissolved directly in buffer. The carbohydrate concentration was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method (37Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39970) Google Scholar, 38Saha S.K. Brewer C.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 254: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Quantitative precipitation studies of galectin-3 with the carbohydrates were carried out in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.15 or 1 m sodium chloride. The volume of the precipitation mixture was 150 μl. The precipitation mixture was allowed to stand for 12 h at 4 °C, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. The tubes were placed on ice, and the supernatant was discarded. The precipitate thus obtained was washed with cold buffer and then dissolved in 0.2 m lactose. The amount of the protein in the precipitate was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm.The time course of precipitation of galectin-3 with the multivalent carbohydrates was determined using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotomer. A buffered solution of the protein in a cuvette was rapidly mixed with a stock solution of a given saccharide in the same buffer at room temperature, and the light scattering was measured at 420 nm.Electron Microscopy—Negative stain electron microscopy was performed by placing the appropriate amount of the precipitate on 300-mesh carbon-coated Parlodion grids that had been freshly glow discharged for 2 min. The samples were touched to filter paper, floated on a drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0, and blotted immediately. The samples were observed at 80 kV in a JEOL 1200 EX electron microscope.RESULTSPrecipitation of Galectin-3 with Asialofetuin, Fetuin, and Multivalent Carbohydrates—Fig. 2A shows the rapid onset of light scattering at 420 nm upon mixing 20 μm galectin-3 with 7 μm ASF, a glycoprotein of molecular mass 48,400 Da (39Spiro R.G.

Chem. 1979; 254: 4545-4553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of 10 mm LacNAc inhibited the light scattering. Precipitation of ASF was also observed at 10 μm galectin-3 (not shown). These results demonstrate that galectin-3 cross-links and precipitates with ASF.Fig. 2Precipitation of galectin-3 with ASF, fetuin,and bivalent pentasaccharides as studied by light scattering at 420 nm.

D, bar diagram of precipitation efficiency of different biantennary pentasaccharides (65 μm) with galectin-3 (150 μm). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature in 150 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.15 m NaCl except with fetuin, where the NaCl concentration used was 1 m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar results were obtained with fetuin (Fig. 2B), although the time course of precipitation was slightly slower than that for ASF. Fetuin differs from ASF in having a mixture of 2,3- and 2,6-sialylation on the terminal LacNAc residues (40Green E.D. Adelt G. Baenziger J.U. Wilson S. Van Halbeek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18253-18268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The slower kinetics of precipitation of fetuin by galectin-3 may be due to reduced functional valency of fetuin relative to ASF.At a concentration of 110 μm or greater, galectin-3 precipitated with the 3,6-pentasaccharide shown in Fig. 1. The time course of precipitation of 110 μm galectin-3 with 50 μm of 3,6-pentasaccharide is shown in Fig. 2C. Fig. 2D shows the relative light scattering intensities of galectin-3 at 150 μm in the presence of the four pentasaccharides (65 μm). The precipitation efficiencies of the oligosaccharides were 3,6-pentasaccharide > 4,6-pentasaccharide > 2,6-pentasaccharide > 2,4-pentasaccharide.Quantitative Precipitation Analysis with Biantennary Pentasaccharides—Quantitative precipitation profiles of galectin-3 with the 3,6-, 2,6-, and 4,6-pentasaccharides (Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 3. All of the profiles including that for the 2,4-pentasaccharide (not shown) showed a single protein peak. The amount of protein precipitated was dependent on buffer salt and galectin-3 concentration (Table I). The highest percentage of precipitated protein (71%) was obtained with the 3,6-pentasaccharide at 250 μm galectin-3 (Fig. 3A). Increasing the salt concentration also increased the amount of protein precipitate from 49 to 64% at a galectin-3 concentration of 110 μm in the presence of the 3,6-pentasaccharide. At the point of maximum precipitation, the peak ratio of monomeric galectin-3 with the bivalent pentasaccharides varied from 2.6:1 to 2.4:1 (Table I).Fig. 3Quantitative precipitation profiles of galectin-3 with the 3,6-, 2,6-,and 4,6-pentasaccharides in Fig. 1.

These latter results agree with Knibbs et al. (42Knibbs R.N. Agrawal N. Wang J.L. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14940-14947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who also observed that galectin-3 precipitates with ASF and fetuin. These findings indicate that the lectin possesses multivalent carbohydrate binding and cross-linking activity. However, to understand the mechanism of binding and cross-linking of galectin-3, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the quaternary structure of the lectin and its precipitation activity. To directly determine the structure of murine recombinant galectin-3 in solution, we recently performed sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements of the protein (31Morris S. Ahmad N. Andre S. Kaltner H. Gabius H.-J. Brenowitz M. Brewer F. Glycobiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). These measurements show that galectin-3 is predominantly a monomer in solution over the concentration range of 7–45 μm. However, a small increase in S20,w coupled with the decrease in D20,w in the sedimentation velocity experiments as a function of galectin-3 concentration suggests that the protein oligomerizes to a small extent with increasing concentrations. The S20,w and D20,w of the CRD domain of galectin-3 alone, however, does not change with increasing concentrations of protein, consistent with the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain is responsible for the association of galectin-3 in solution (25Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14167-14174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mehul B. Bawumia S. Martin S.R. Hughes R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18250-18258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and not the C-terminal domain (43Kuklinski S. Probstmeier R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 814-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Similar sedimentation measurements of galectin-3 were performed in the presence of LacNAc (31Morris S. Ahmad N. Andre S. Kaltner H. Gabius H.-J. Brenowitz M. Brewer F. Glycobiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the nonreducing terminal disaccharide moiety in the pentasaccharides in Fig. 1 and ASF. These experiments addressed the possibility that binding of LacNAc itself could induce oligomerization of galectin-3. However, bound LacNAc did not change either the molecular mass or the hydrodynamic parameters of intact galectin-3 or its CRD domain (31Morris S. Ahmad N. Andre S. Kaltner H. Gabius H.-J. Brenowitz M. Brewer F. Glycobiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, galectin-3 does not oligomerize upon the binding of the LacNAc epitope.Precipitation Activity of Galectin-3—The present results show that galectin-3 precipitates with ASF at a concentration as low as 10 μm lectin, indicating that an oligomeric form of galectin-3 must exist at this low concentration in addition to the predominant monomeric form of the protein. Fig. 3 also shows that galectin-3 at higher concentrations precipitates with the biantennary pentasaccharides in Fig. 1. This indicates the valency of the oligomeric form of galectin-3 must be greater than two because bivalent lectins do not precipitate with bivalent carbohydrates (44Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 455-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Quatitative precipitation experiments with the pentasaccharides in Fig. 1 provides insight into the oligomeric form of the protein that precipitates with these carbohydrates.Fig. 3 shows the quantitative precipitation profiles of galectin-3 in the presence of the 3,6-, 2,6-, and 4,6-pentasaccharides. Similar results were observed for the 2,4-pentasaccharide (not shown). The profiles of galectin-3 show single protein peaks in each experiment, indicating a single galectin-3 species precipitating with the pentasaccharides. The ratio of the galectin-3 monomer to bivalent saccharide at the point of maximum precipitation in the profiles ranges from 2.4:1 to 2.6:1 (Table I). The average percentage of precipitated galectin-3 is between 40 and 70% with the pentasaccharides (Table I). Because the structural valency of each pentasaccharide is 2, and two pentasaccharides (four equivalents of LacNAc) are minimally required to form a two-dimensional cross-linked complex (44Dam T.K. Brewer C.F. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 362: 455-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), this suggests that galectin-3 precipitates as a pentamer (2 × ∼2.5 = 5) with the pentasaccharides. The proposed complex is shown in Scheme 1, which also indicates that one arm of the galectin-3 pentamer is not involved in cross-linking interactions. The ratio of 2:5 pentasaccharide/protein molecules does not rule out other higher ratios of the pentasaccharide to protein complexes but rather is the lowest ratio of carbohydrate to protein required for precipitation of a two-dimensional cross-linked complex.Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Kinetics of Precipitation of Galectin-3 with Multivalent Carbohydrates and Model of a Pentamer-Monomer Equilibrium for the Lectin—The kinetics of precipitation of galectin-3 with ASF, fetuin, and the 3,6-pentasaccharide (Fig. 2) are all relatively fast, on the order of seconds. Because the precipitating species of galectin-3 appears to be a pentamer, the interconversion of monomer to pentamer must be fast to allow precipitation of the pentamer to be fast. Hence, the precipitating galectin-3 pentamer is rapidly replaced by monomer by mass action equilibria, as shown in Scheme 1. That this occurs by mass action equilibria and not a conformational change in the protein leading to oligomerization is supported by the fact that galectin-3 remains a monomer in the presence of LacNAc (31Morris S. Ahmad N. Andre S. Kaltner H. Gabius H.-J. Brenowitz M. Brewer F. Glycobiology. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), the binding epitope(s) on the pentasaccharides in Fig. 1 and ASF.

https://openalex.org/W2149138273,"Viruses must overcome diverse intracellular defense mechanisms to establish infection. The Vif (virion infectivity factor) protein of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) acts by overcoming the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a cytidine deaminase that induces G to A hypermutation in newly synthesized viral DNA. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G incorporation into virions renders HIV-1 non-infectious. We report here that Vif counteracts the antiviral activity of APOBEC3G by targeting it for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Vif forms a complex with APOBEC3G and enhances APOBEC3G ubiquitination, resulting in reduced steady-state APOBEC3G levels and a decrease in protein half-life. Furthermore, Vif-dependent degradation of APOBEC3G is blocked by proteasome inhibitors or ubiquitin mutant K48R. A mutation of highly conserved cysteines or the deletion of a conserved SLQ(Y/F)LA motif in Vif results in mutants that fail to induce APOBEC3G degradation and produce non-infectious HIV-1; however, mutations of conserved phosphorylation sites in Vif that impair viral replication do not affect APOBEC3G degradation, suggesting that Vif is important for other functions in addition to inducing proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G. Vif is monoubiquitinated in the absence of APOBEC3G but is polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded when APOBEC3G is coexpressed, suggesting that coexpression accelerates the degradation of both proteins. These results suggest that Vif functions by targeting APOBEC3G for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and implicate the proteasome as a site of dynamic interplay between microbial and cellular defenses."
https://openalex.org/W2161488670,"The activities of many neuronal proteins are modulated by ethanol, but the fundamental mechanisms underlying behavioral effects of ethanol remain unclear. To identify mechanisms responsible for intoxication, we screened for Caenorhabditis elegans mutants with altered behavioral responses to ethanol. We found that slo-1 mutants, which were previously recognized as having slightly uncoordinated movement, are highly resistant to ethanol in two behavioral assays. Numerous loss-of-function slo-1 alleles emerged from our screens, indicating that slo-1 has a central role in ethanol responses. slo-1 encodes the BK potassium channel. Electrophysiological analysis shows that ethanol activates the channel in vivo, which would inhibit neuronal activity. Moreover, behaviors of slo-1 gain-of-function mutants resemble those of ethanol-intoxicated animals. These results demonstrate that selective activation of BK channels is responsible for acute intoxicating effects of ethanol in C. elegans. BK channel activation may explain a variety of behavioral responses to ethanol in invertebrate and vertebrate systems."

Thus, to resolve the molecular basis of catalysis, and also to understand the structural features governing bisphosphonate recognition, we determined the structures of unliganded Staphylococcus aureus FPPS (FPPS-Sa), as well as two Escherichia coli FPPS (FPPS-Ec) ternary complexes. These ternary complexes include a 2.4-Å “substrate-bound” structure containing IPP and the noncleavable DMAPP analogue dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate (DMSPP) (18Phan R.M. Poulter C.D. Org.

The resulting PCR products were cloned into an E. coli expression vectors to give an open reading frame encoding FPPS-Ec fused to N-terminal six-histidine tag and FPPS-Sa fused to C-terminal six-histidine tag. To generate selemenomethionine-labeled protein, the expression plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotroph DL41 (21Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Recombinant FPPSs were purified using ProBond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen) followed by diafiltration into 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled S. aureus FPPS were grown using nanovolume crystallization techniques by mixing 50 nl of protein solution with 50 nl of reservoir (22Hosfield D. Palan J. Hilgers M. Scheibe D. McRee D.E. Stevens R.C. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Substrate and inhibitor-bound crystals of E. coli FPPS were obtained by preincubating enzyme (10 mg/ml) with 2.5 mm IPP, DMSPP, and MgCl2 or 2.5 mm IPP, risedronate, and MgCl2 and then mixing 50 nl of this solution with 50 nl of reservoir. Crystals were harvested in reservoir solutions supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data from the S. aureus crystals were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) Beam Line 5.0.2 using a wavelength of 0.978 Å. X-ray diffraction data from the E. coli crystals were collected at Advanced Light Source Beam Line 5.0.3 using a wavelength of 1.00 Å. All data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Crystals of the S. aureus enzyme belong to the space group P6122 and have two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Ligand-bound crystals of the E. coli enzyme belong to the space group P4122 and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in (see Table I in Supplemental Material). The structure of S. aureus FPPS was determined using single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phases calculated with the program SHARP (24La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar). The E. coli structures were determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) with the refined S. aureus structure (∼40% sequence identity) as a search model. Both structures were refined without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in REFMAC and inspected, built, and rebuilt using Xfit (26McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar).RESULTSS. aureus FPPS—The structure of FPPS-Sa confirms the conservation of the 3-layered all α-helical prenyltransferase fold and reveals regions of conformational flexibility important for enzyme activity (Fig. 2A). The first α-helical layer is formed by helices 1 and 2 and is orthogonal to the two others. The second layer contains helices 3, 4, 6, and 11. The third layer is formed by helices 7, 8, 9, and 10. Helices 4 and 8 are located in the center of the protein core and contain the conserved Asp-rich motifs that mediate substrate binding and catalysis. As observed in avian FPPS (16Tarshis L.C. Yan M.

FPPS undergoes significant substrate-induced active-site rearrangements that protect the centrally located substrate-binding cavity from bulk solvent and position active site residues in a catalytically competent conformation (Fig. 2A). Compared with the unliganded S. aureus and avian structures (16Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C.

Significantly, all three regions contain conserved residues that contact substrate and inhibitor diphosphate atoms. FPPS binds to the DMSPP diphosphate through a trinuclear Mg2+ cluster that is ligated by three conserved aspartates located on opposite walls of the active-site cavity (Fig. 2B). All three Mg2+ atoms are octahedrally coordinated by protein, pyrophosphate, and water oxygens (Fig. 2B). The side chain of Asp244 from the second DDXXD motif, two diphosphate oxygen atoms, and three water molecules coordinate Mg1. The side chains of Asp105 and Asp111 from the first DDXXD motif, two diphosphate oxygens, and two water molecules complete the Mg2-binding site. Asp105 and Asp111, as well as a diphosphate oxygen and three water molecules, coordinate the third active site Mg (Mg3). Significantly, the DMSPP diphosphate further contacts the side chains of conserved Lys202 as well as α4-α5 residue Arg116 and α9-α10 residue Lys258. These latter interactions likely play a key role in pyrophosphate release and substrate reloading (see below).The hydrocarbon tail of DMSPP extends into a deep pocket that accommodates the growing isoprenyl product (16Tarshis L.C.

The pocket extends to the dimer interface with residues from helix 4 (Tyr100, Ser101, His104, and Met110), helix 7 (Met175 and Cys176), and helix 6 (Ile132, Leu133, Asp136) of the adjacent subunit forming the walls of the pocket. Hydrophobic interactions with Gln179 and Lys202 on one side, and Ser101, Leu102, and Thr203 on the other, position the DMSPP hydrocarbon tail within van der Waals distance of the C1, C2, C3, and C4 atoms of IPP.IPP binding is mediated by the C terminus of the enzyme that organizes residues contacting the IPP pyrophosphate (Fig. 2B). A salt bridge between the C-terminal carboxylate and Lys66 positions its side chain N∈ atom to directly interact with two nonbridging diphosphate oxygens. Arg318, which is also positioned by a C-terminal salt bridge, forms a water-mediated interaction to a single diphosphate oxygen. Additional interactions to the IPP pyrophosphate include hydrogen bonds with Gly65 and His98, and salt bridges with Arg69 and Arg117. These enzyme-IPP pyrophosphate interactions anchor IPP in the FPPS active site such that its hydrocarbon tail is buttressed between conserved Phe240 and the hydrophobic tail of DMSPP (Fig. 2B). Notably, these interactions position the nucleophilic C3–C5 double bond of IPP 3.2 Å from the C1 atom of DMSPP (Fig 3A).Fig. 3Stereo illustration of the FPPS carbocation-binding site and structure-based three-metal ion mechanism for FPPS isoprenoid condensation.A, the side chain oxygen atoms of Thr203 and Gln241 and the main chain carbonyl of Lys202 are oriented with their negative dipoles directed toward the allylic carbocation-binding site. The nonmetal-ligated pyrophosphate oxygen that serves as the catalytic base to remove the IPP C2 proR hydrogen, the reactive C3–C5 double bond of IPP, and the C1 atom of DMSPP are illustrated. B, substrate ionization by the trinuclear Mg2+ center generates an allylic carbocation that alkylates that C5 atom of IPP. Double bond formation in the final product is mediated by a DMAPP pyrophosphate oxygen that serves as the catalytic base removing the IPP C2 pro-R hydrogen.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FPPS IPP·Risedronate Ternary Complex—The FPPS IPP·risedronate complex reveals that bisphosphonates inhibit FPPS by binding to the trinuclear Mg2+ center in a manner identical to that of DMSPP (Fig. 2C). The conformational changes, interactions with IPP, as well as the interactions to the inhibitors carbon-linked pyrophosphate, mimic those seen in the substrate complex. The pyridyl side chain of the bisphosphonate inhibitor binds to the same hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the C5-hydrocarbon tail of DMSPP. Similar stacking interactions to those described for DMSPP, as well as a hydrogen bond between the pyridyl nitrogen and conserved Thr203, position the inhibitor to make tight van der Walls contacts with IPP.DISCUSSIONStructure-based Three-metal Ion Catalytic Mechanism—Biochemical studies have revealed that the reaction catalyzed by FPPS occurs by a three-step ionization-condensation-elimination mechanism (27Poulter C.D. Argyle J.C. Mash E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7227-7233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in which the double bond of IPP is stereospecifically alkylated by the C1 atom of the allylic substrate (28Cornforth J.W. Cornforth R.H. Popjak G. Yengoyan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3970-3987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2.4-Å structure of the IPP·DMSPP ternary complex reveals the structural basis for this three-step mechanism.The geometry of the FPPS trinuclear Mg2+ cluster is exquisitely tuned to initiate substrate ionization, with all three metal ions participating in catalysis. In the substrate complex Mg1 and Mg2 each form six-membered ring chelate structures with two unesterified pyrophosphate oxygens, while Mg3 ligates a single unesterified oxygen of the linking pyrophosphate (Fig. 2B). These interactions, as well as those to the IPP pyrophosphate, juxtapose the hydrophobic C5 isoprenoid tails in a conformation suitable for catalysis. Initial ionization of the allylic disphosphate triggered by the FPPS metal center would thus generate an allylic carbocation with its positive charge distributed over the C1, C2, and C3 atoms. As pyrophosphate is generated, the developing negative charge would be stabilized by interactions with the trinuclear metal center. Likewise, the positively charged allylic cation is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the liberated pyrophosphate and also through conserved FPPS interactions. Notably, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Lys202, and the side chain oxygens of Thr203 and Gln241, form a carbocation-binding site by directing their negative dipoles toward the positive charge localized over the DMAPP C1, C2, and C3 atoms (Fig. 3, A and B). Our trapped substrate complex suggests that this cation would be quickly condensed with the nucleophilic C3–C5 double bond of IPP, which is only 3.2 Å from the DMSPP C1 position (Fig. 3A). Our structure further reveals that a non-metal-ligated pyrophosphate oxygen is the catalytic base that deprotonates the condensed intermediate to generate the C5-extended isoprenoid reaction product. (Fig. 3, A and B). In the ternary complex this catalytic oxygen is ligated by conserved Arg116 and Lys258 (Fig. 3A) and, consistent with biochemical data (28Cornforth J.W. Cornforth R.H. Popjak G. Yengoyan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3970-3987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Leyes A.E. Baker J.A. Poulter C.D. Org Lett. 1999; 1: 1071-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is correctly positioned to abstract the IPP C2 pro-R hydrogen. Notably, both Arg116 and Lys258 emanate from the conformationally variable α4-α5 and α9-α10 active-site loops that shield the reaction from bulk solvent. Pyrophosphate-mediated proton abstraction would weaken these interactions and could thus disrupt the structure of these loops to facilitate pyrophosphate release and IPP reloading.Bisphosphonate-mediated FPPS Inhibition—Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates are proposed to inhibit FPPS by mimicking the carbocation intermediate formed after substrate ionization (30Martin M.B. Arnold W. Heath III, H.T. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The structure of the FPPS IPP·risedronate ternary complex presented here confirms this suggestion and reveals how key enzyme residues, as well as IPP participate in inhibitor binding. Risedronate binds to the FPPS allylic substrate-binding pocket by using its carbon-linked pyrophosphate group to ligate the trinuclear metal center and by inserting its pyridyl group into the isoprenoid-binding pocket. Significant enzyme affinity for nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates is thus achieved through interactions between the sp2 hybridized planar side chain that occupies the allylic carbocation-binding site described above (Fig. 3A). Like DMSPP, the inhibitor makes significant interactions with the C2, C3, C4, and C5 atoms of IPP and thus may be unable to bind tightly to the enzyme in its absence.The recent discovery that bisphosphonates used to treat osteoporosis are potent FPPS inhibitors has stemmed much interest in understanding the structural features governing this inhibition. These FPPS ternary complexes illustrate how substrate-induced conformational changes facilitate catalysis and reveal how bisphosphonates target the closed, catalytically active conformation of the enzyme. The complexes presented here thus clarify the structural basis for bisphosphonate inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis and provide a structural template for designing novel molecules that could be efficacious in treating both microbial and parasitic infections and other human diseases. Post-translational modification of C-terminal CAAX sequences by covalent attachment of isoprenyl chains is crucial for intracellular localization and proper function of small GTPases such as Ras, Rac, Rho, and CDC42 (1Vicent D.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4384-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The substrates for these modifications are the 15-carbon isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) 1The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase; IPP, isopentyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; DMSPP, dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: FPP, farnesyl pyrophosphate; FPPS, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase; IPP, isopentyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; DMSPP, dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate. or the 20-carbon isoprenoid geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate synthesized by enzymes of the mevalonate pathway (3Spurgeon S.L. Porter J.W. Porter J.W. Spurgeon S.L. Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid Compounds. John Wiley and Sons, New York1981: 1-93Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). A key branch point enzyme of the mevalonate pathway is farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (FPPS), a ∼30-kDa Mg2+-dependent homodimeric enzyme that synthesizes (E,E)-FPP from isopentyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) (4Nishino T.

Interest in understanding FPPS activity stems from the recent discovery that FPPS is the molecular target of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (6van Beek E. Pieterman E. Cohen L. Lowik C. Papapoulos S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 7van Beek E. Pieterman E. Cohen L. Lowik C. Papapoulos S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Bisphophonates are non-cleavable pyrophosphate (P-O-P) analogues in which the central oxygen is replaced by a carbon (P-C-P) with various side chains (Fig. 1C). Against parasitic organisms (8Montalvetti A. Fernandez A. Sanders J.M. Ghosh S. Van Brussel E. Oldfield E. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Targets. 2002; 6: 407-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) these agents have been shown in vitro to disrupt cell growth through FPPS inhibition. In people, bisphosphonates are targeted to bone tissue (10Rogers M.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2643-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) where FPPS inhibition in bone-resorbing osteoclasts is a current therapeutic approach for treating post-menopausal osteoporosis (11Rodan G.A.

Med. 2003; 19: 395-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because of their bone-targeting properties, bisphosphonates have also found use as agents to treat tumor-induced hypercalcemia (13Riccardi A. Grasso D. Danova M. Tumori. 2003; 89: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), Paget's disease (14Bartl R. Dtsch. Med. Wochenschr. 2002; 127: 638PubMed Google Scholar), and osteolytic metastases (15Green J.R. Cancer. 2003; 97: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although structures of apo- and ligand-bound avian FPPS have been solved (16Tarshis L.C. Yan M. Poulter C.D. Sacchettini J.C.

A. 1996; 93: 15018-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), the active sites are unassembled and do not provide substantial information concerning catalysis. Thus, to resolve the molecular basis of catalysis, and also to understand the structural features governing bisphosphonate recognition, we determined the structures of unliganded Staphylococcus aureus FPPS (FPPS-Sa), as well as two Escherichia coli FPPS (FPPS-Ec) ternary complexes. These ternary complexes include a 2.4-Å “substrate-bound” structure containing IPP and the noncleavable DMAPP analogue dimethylallyl S-thiolodiphosphate (DMSPP) (18Phan R.M. Poulter C.D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and a 1.95-Å bisphosphonate-bound structure containing IPP and the osteoporosis drug 1-hydroxy-2-(3-pyridinyl)ethylidene bisphosphonic acid (risedronate) (Fig. 1C). Since the E. coli enzyme shares conserved active site residues with human FPPS (19Koyama T. Obata S. Osabe M. Takeshita A. Yokoyama K. Uchida M. Nishino T. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), these complexes provide a structural framework for the development of novel FPPS inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzyme Expression and Purification—Open reading frames encoding FPPS genes were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction from E. coli (JM109) and S. aureus (ATCC35556D) genomic DNA. The resulting PCR products were cloned into an E. coli expression vectors to give an open reading frame encoding FPPS-Ec fused to N-terminal six-histidine tag and FPPS-Sa fused to C-terminal six-histidine tag. To generate selemenomethionine-labeled protein, the expression plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotroph DL41 (21Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Recombinant FPPSs were purified using ProBond nickel-chelating resin (Invitrogen) followed by diafiltration into 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 0.25 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled S. aureus FPPS were grown using nanovolume crystallization techniques by mixing 50 nl of protein solution with 50 nl of reservoir (22Hosfield D.

This important reaction leads e.g. to the reduction of the potent androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) into inactive 3β-androstanediol (3β-Diol). Four human cytosolic aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1–AKR1C4) are known to act as non-positional-specific 3α-/17β-/20α-HSDs. We now demonstrate that AKR1Cs catalyze the reduction of DHT into both 3α- and 3β-Diol (established by 1H NMR spectroscopy). The rates of 3α- versus 3β-Diol formation varied significantly among the isoforms, but with each enzyme both activities were equally inhibited by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug flufenamic acid. In vitro, AKR1Cs also expressed substantial 3α[17β]-hydroxysteroid oxidase activity with 3α-Diol as the substrate. However, in contrast to the 3-ketosteroid reductase activity of the enzymes, their hydroxysteroid oxidase activity was potently inhibited by low micromolar concentrations of the opposing cofactor (NADPH). This indicates that in vivo all AKR1Cs will preferentially work as reductases. Human hepatoma (HepG2) cells (which lack 3β-HSD/Δ5–4 ketosteroid isomerase mRNA expression, but express AKR1C1–AKR1C3) were able to convert DHT into 3α- and 3β-Diol. This conversion was inhibited by flufenamic acid establishing the in vivo significance of the 3α/3β-HSD activities of the AKR1C enzymes. Molecular docking simulations using available crystal structures of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 demonstrated how 3α/3β-HSD activities are achieved. The observation that AKR1Cs are a source of 3β-tetrahydrosteroids is of physiological significance because: (i) the formation of 3β-Diol (in contrast to 3α-Diol) is virtually irreversible, (ii) 3β-Diol is a pro-apoptotic ligand for estrogen receptor β, and (iii) 3β-tetrahydrosteroids act as γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor antagonists.

Two classes of 3β-hydroxysteroids, i.e. the Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroids and the fully saturated 3β-tetrahydrosteroids, represent pivotal intermediates in steroid hormone metabolism. In steroidogenic glands, Δ5-3β-hydroxysteroid precursors are converted into Δ4-3-ketosteroids to produce active steroid hormones (1Simard J. Durocher F. Mébarki F. Turgeon C. Sanchez R. Labrie Y.

However, in vivo their directionality will be governed by the redox environment and, under normal cofactor ratios (were NAD+ dominates over NADH) (26Krebs H.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 299-318PubMed Google Scholar, 27Reich J.G. Sel'kov E.E. Energy Metabolism of the Cell: A Theoretical Treatise. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar), they will work preferentially as oxidases. Moreover, the 3β-HSD/KSI isoforms are membrane-associated and, therefore, cannot be the source of the cytosolic NADPH-dependent 3β-HSDs in target tissues capable of producing 3β-tetrahydrosteroids.Proteins of two phylogenies catalyze the 3-ketosteroid reduction of 5α/5β-dihydrosteroids via 3α-HSD activity: (i) four cytosolic enzymes of the AKR1C subfamily in the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, i.e. 20α[3α]-HSD (AKR1C1), human 3α-HSD type 3 (AKR1C2; also known as bile acidbinding protein), human 3α-HSD type 2 (AKR1C3; also known as human 17β-HSD type 5), and human 3α-HSD type 1 (AKR1C4) (2Penning T.M. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 281-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and (ii) five membrane-associated enzymes of the SDR family, i.e. 11-cis/9-cis-retinol dehydrogenase, retinol dehydrogenase type 4 (RoDH-4), “human RoDH” or RoDH-like 3α-HSD, “novel type human microsomal 3α-HSD” and short chain l-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (28Wang J.

Acta. 2000; 1484: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Previously, AKR1C1–AKR1C4 have been shown to act as non-positional-specific 3α-/17β-/20α-HSDs (34Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.-F. Lin H.-K. Ma H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This means that in vitro these isoforms catalyzed the bi-directional interconversion of 3-ketosteroids and 3α-hydroxysteroids, 17-ketosteroids, and 17β-hydroxysteroids, as well as 20-ketosteroids and 20α-hydroxysteroids to varying extents. However, their retention of stereo-specificity has not been addressed to date. Using more discriminating TLC systems than that previously utilized (34Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.-F. Lin H.-K. Ma H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), we now demonstrate for the first time that in vitro as well as in vivo AKR1C1–AKR1C4 catalyze the reduction of DHT not only into 3α-Diol but also into 3β-Diol. The ratio of reductive 3α-HSD versus 3β-HSD activity varied significantly among the isoforms in a way that AKR1C1 has to be considered as a 3β-HSD with subsidiary 3α-HSD activity, AKR1C2 as an efficient and an almost exclusive 3α-HSD, AKR1C3 as a weak 3α/3β-HSD, and AKR1C4 as an efficient 3α-HSD with subsidiary 3β-HSD activity. Inhibition experiments using the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) flufenamic acid (which acts as a competitive inhibitor) indicated that a single active site is responsible for the formation of the diastereomers. We provide evidence that in vivo all isoforms will work predominantly as reductases and show that 3β-HSD activity of the AKR1C isoforms is biologically relevant in human hepatoma cells. Using available crystal structures of AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 (35Jin Y. Stayrook S.E. Albert R.H. Palackal N.T. Penning T.M. Lewis M.

Thus, the human AKR1C isozymes are both nonpositional and non-stereo-selective HSDs and represent a potential cytosolic source of 3β-tetrahydrosteroids in target tissues such as prostate and brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSteroids and Chemicals—[4-14C]DHT (53.5 mCi/mmol) and the liquid scintillation mixture Ultima Gold™ were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [4-14C]3α-Androstanediol and [4-14C]3β-androstanediol were synthesized enzymatically from [4-14C]DHT using recombinant AKR1C9 and recombinant AKR1C1, respectively. All unlabeled steroids were obtained from Steraloids (Wilton, NH). Flufenamic acid was purchased from ICN Biomedical Inc. (Aurora, OH). Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3, 99.9 atom % D) was obtained from Aldrich. Pyridine nucleotides were purchased from Roche Applied Science. TRIzol LS reagent, Superscript II preamplification system and oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Invitrogen. Human tissue RNA was purchased from BD Bioscience Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). All other reagents were of American Chemical Society grade or better.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human AKR1C Isoforms—Recombinant human AKR1C isoforms were overexpressed in Escherichia coli C41(DE3) host cells transformed with the inducible prokaryotic expression vectors pET-16b as described previously (38Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 39Ratnam K. Ma H. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7856-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were grown in cultures of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and nontransformed control cells were grown in cultures of LB media without ampicillin. Upon reaching an A600 of 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to induce enzyme expression overnight. Bacterial sonicates were prepared and aliquots were centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C to obtain cytosolic enzyme preparations.Recombinant enzymes were purified to homogeneity from the sonicates by sequential chromatography on a DE52 anion exchange and a Sepharose Blue column according to a previously described protocol (38Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to yield enzymes of the following specific activities: 0.21 μmol of androsterone (75 μm) oxidized/min/mg (AKR1C4) and 2.1, 2.5, and 2.8 μmol of 1-acenaphthenol (1 mm) oxidized/min/mg (AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3, respectively). Purity of the enzymes was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and protein concentration was determined (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). The homogeneous enzymes were stored in aliquots at -80 °C.Radiometric Assays—Standard incubations were conducted in a final volume of 100 μl containing 37.5 μm unlabeled steroid and 3.75 μm (0.02 μCi) amounts of the respective 4-14C-labeled compound in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 2.3 mm NADPH and 4% acetonitrile. Reactions were started by the addition of either 1 μl of purified enzyme (5.0, 6.2, 5.8, 9.0, and 7.2 μg of purified AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, and AKR1C9, respectively) or 1 μl of bacterial cytosol (containing 10.3, 4.7, 6.4, 5.5, and 8.1 μg of cytosolic protein from AKR1C1, AKR1C2, AKR1C3, AKR1C4, and AKR1C9 transformed cells, respectively, or 8.6 μg of cytosolic protein from nontransformed control cells) and incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold ethyl acetate and steroids extracted by continuous vortexing for 5 min. The organic phases were transferred into a glass tube, and the extraction step was repeated once. The combined organic phases were evaporated to complete dryness.The dried extracts were redissolved in 40 μl of ethyl acetate and applied to LK6D Silica TLC plates (Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ). Remaining residues of the extracts were redissolved in 40 μl of chloroform/ethanol (35:15, v/v) containing 25 μg each of nonradioactive reference steroids: androstanedione, DHT, androsterone, 3α-Diol, and 3β-Diol. Epiandrosterone was not used because it could not be separated from androsterone. The chloroform/ethanol mixtures were then applied to the LK6D Silica TLC plates on top of the corresponding first spot. The chromatograms were developed in chloroform/ethyl acetate (4:1, v/v) as follows: (i) the TLC plates were predeveloped three times until the solvent front reached 5, 8, and 12 mm above the origin, and (ii) the plates were fully developed twice. The TLC plates were completely dried between steps. Co-chromatographed reference steroids were stained by spraying with an acetic acid/sulfuric acid/anisaldehyde (100: 2:1, v/v/v) solution and heating. The amounts of substrate and products were quantified by scraping the corresponding silica gel sections into scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was counted as automatically quenchcorrected dpm with a TriCarb 2100 (Packard Instrument, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The relative amount of each corresponding radioactive steroid was calculated as percentage of the total radioactivity recovered from a single TLC lane. Blank values were subtracted. For autoradiography analysis the TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film prior to scraping.Determination of Steady State Kinetic Parameters—The kcat(app) values for DHT reduction catalyzed by the 3α-HSD and 3β-HSD activities of the AKR1C isoforms were calculated using the exact molecular weight of the AKR1C isoforms to convert specific enzyme activities obtained from time courses, which were followed radiometrically. KM values for the reduction of DHT were previously determined to range from 8.3 ± 1.5 μm (AKR1C4) to 80.6 ± 28.8 μm (AKR1C1) in radiometric assays (34Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.-F. Lin H.-K. Ma H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In the assays performed here, the final substrate concentration was 41.25 μm, which is the solubility limit of DHT in the incubation systems. Because saturation was not achieved for each isoform, kcat values were considered apparent values. Specific enzyme activities were calculated by determination of the tangents to the linear part of the exponential fit of the untransformed progress curve. Nonlinear curve fitting was performed with the Fig.P 2.7 program for Windows (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom) using the equation for pseudo-first order decay: [P]t = [S]0 (1 - e-kt).Enzymatic Synthesis of [4-14C]3α-Diol and [4-14C]3β-Diol Substrates—Two μCi [4-14C]DHT were evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen and redissolved in 40 μl of acetonitrile. The steroid substrate was then added to a 1-ml incubation system containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 2.3 mm NADPH. The reaction was started by the addition of excess recombinant AKR1C9 (specific activity of 1.6 μmol of androsterone (75 μm) oxidized/min/mg) (41Pawlowski J.E. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13502-13510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and monitored at 340 nm at 25 °C until the predicted absorbance change in NADPH indicated that the entire substrate had been converted to 3α-Diol. The reaction mixture was extracted five times with 2 ml of ethyl acetate, and the pooled extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated to complete dryness. The residues were redissolved twice in 200 μl of ethyl acetate, and spotted on a 20 × 20-cm TLC glass plate precoated with a 0.25-mm layer of silica gel. Chromatograms were developed in chloroform/ethyl acetate (4:1, v/v) as described above. [4-14C]3α-Diol was isolated after identification of its position on the TLC plate by autoradiography and by comparison to an authentic reference standard. The steroid was eluted from the silica gel four times with 2 ml of ethyl acetate. The pooled extracts were dried over sodium sulfate, evaporated to complete dryness, and redissolved in acetonitrile to yield a stock solution of 0.375 nmol (0.02 μCi)/μl. Recovery of label in [4-14C]3α-Diol was 77.6%.The synthesis of [4-14C]3β-Diol was conducted in an identical manner, but excess recombinant AKR1C1 was used as the catalyst and the reaction was conducted for 2 h at 37 °C. A stock solution of 0.375 nmol (0.02 μCi)/μl was obtained. Recovery of label in [4-14C]3β-Diol was 67.3%.Identification of 3α- and 3β-Diol as Products of AKR1C Reduction of DHT by NMR Analysis—To authenticate the identity of the 3α/3β-Diol products formed by the reduction of DHT via AKR1C enzymes, reactions were performed on a large scale. Metabolites were synthesized in a 100-ml system containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm NADPH, and 100 μm unlabeled DHT. The reaction was started by the addition of 1 ml of bacterial cytosol (10.3 mg of protein) from cells overexpressing AKR1C1 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Steroids were extracted twice with 100 ml of ethyl acetate and a third time with 50 ml of ethyl acetate. The pooled extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated to complete dryness. The residues were redissolved twice in 500 μl of ethyl acetate, and spotted on two 20 × 20-cm TLC glass plates precoated with a 0.25-mm layer of silica gel. 3α-Diol and 3β-Diol were isolated after development in chloroform/ethyl acetate (4:1, v/v) as described above. The steroid products were eluted from the corresponding silica gel fractions three times with 6 ml of ethyl acetate. The pooled elutes were dried over sodium sulfate, evaporated to complete dryness, and redissolved in 1 ml of CDCl3. The redissolved samples were again evaporated to complete dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of CDCl3.1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) data were collected on a Varian Unity 500 Spectrometer operating at 500 MHz, using CDCl3 as the solvent. Chemical shifts are reported relative to tetramethylsilane at 0.00 ppm with the residual signal of CDCl3 serving as the secondary reference at 7.24 ppm.Synthesis of AKR1C1–AKR1C4 Full-length Standard cDNAs— Standard complementary DNA (cDNA) of AKR1C1–AKR1C4 was excised from the prokaryotic expression vectors pET-16b containing the respective cDNA clones (38Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) via digestion with XhoI and BglII. Digestion products were size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, and the respective cDNA bands were purified from the gel with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The procedure yielded full-length double-stranded cDNA of the isoforms with an additional 105-bp vector DNA at the 5′ end of the leading strand.RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells using the TRIzol reagent. Reverse transcription (RT) of 1 μg of total RNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase was performed according to the protocol from the manufacturer. RT was performed at 42 °C for 50 min and was terminated by denaturing the reverse transcriptase at 70 °C for 15 min.Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted using 100 ng of HepG2 cDNA and human tissue cDNA samples, respectively. In a final volume of 50 μl the PCR systems contained 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 20 pmol of the respective oligonucleotide primers. In addition, the PCR systems for the amplification of AKR1C2, AKR1C4, and β-actin transcripts contained 2.5 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide. To amplify the transcripts of the AKR1C isoforms, the β-actin housekeeping gene and the 3β-HSD/KSI isoforms, oligonucleotide primers crossing intronexon boundaries were used as described (34Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.-F. Lin H.-K. Ma H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 42Gingras S. Simard J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4573-4584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCR was initiated by a 5-min denaturation step at 94 °C. The isoform-specific oligonucleotide primers utilized for amplification of AKR1C1–AKR1C4 transcripts yielded PCR products of the same size of 590 bp. The PCR program for amplification of the AKR1C transcripts consisted of 30 cycles with a 45-s denaturation step at 94 °C, followed by a 45-s annealing step (at 55 °C for AKR1C4, 60 °C for AKR1C1 and AKR1C3, or 62 °C for AKR1C2) and a 2-min extension step at 72 °C. The pair of oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the β-actin transcript yielded a 838-bp PCR product. The respective PCR program consisted of 30 cycles with a 30-s denaturation step at 94 °C, followed by a 60-s annealing step at 60 °C and a 2-min extension step at 72 °C. The pair of oligonucleotide primers utilized for amplification of the highly homologous 3β-HSD/KSI transcripts detected both known human isozymes and gave the same amplified cDNA size of 790 bp in RT-PCR. The respective PCR program consisted of 35 cycles with a 45-s denaturation step at 94 °C, followed by a 45-s annealing step at 64 °C and a 2-min extension step at 72 °C. A 10-min final extension step at 72 °C completed all PCR protocols. The products were resolved on 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and then visualized under ultraviolet light using the digital GDS-8000 UVP BioImaging System (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA).Optical Density Analysis—Optical density analyses were carried out to determine the amount of AKR1C1–AKR1C4 products amplified from total HepG2 cDNA in comparison to the amount of PCR products amplified from 25, 2.5, or 0.25 ng of the respective authentic full-length standard cDNAs. PCR products were size-fractionated on 2% agarose gels and evaluated with the digital GDS-8000 UVP imaging system. Densitometric analysis of the appropriate bands and the background was performed using the Labworks™ software (UVP, Inc.). Linear regression analyses of the data (with the concentration of standard cDNA in the log scale) gave the approximate mRNA concentration in HepG2 cells.Cell Culture Experiments—HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells (4 × 106) were maintained in 60-mm dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 containing 5 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 500 units of penicillin, 500 units of streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. To measure DHT metabolism, cells were incubated in 5 ml of fresh medium containing 10 μm DHT (including 0.4 μCi [4-14C]DHT). In the inhibition experiments, an additional 100 μm flufenamic acid was added. Aliquots (150 μl) of the medium were withdrawn twice from each dish at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 h, diluted with 350 μl of ice-cold H2O, and e"
https://openalex.org/W2068646859,"Mammalian Fbw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein component of an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein-Rbx1)-type ubiquitin ligase, and the mouse Fbw7 is expressed prominently in the endothelial cell lineage of embryos. We generated mice deficient in Fbw7 and found that the embryos died in utero at embryonic day 10.5-11.5, manifesting marked abnormalities in vascular development. Vascular remodeling was impaired in the brain and yolk sac, and the major trunk veins were not formed. In vitro para-aortic splanchnopleural explant cultures from Fbw7-/- embryos also manifested an impairment of vascular network formation. Notch4, which is the product of the proto-oncogene Int3 and an endothelial cell-specific mammalian isoform of Notch, accumulated in Fbw7-/- embryos, resulting in an increased expression of Hey1, which encodes a transcriptional repressor that acts downstream of Notch signaling and is implicated in vascular development. Expression of Notch1, -2, or -3 or of cyclin E was unaffected in Fbw7-/- embryos. Mammalian Fbw7 thus appears to play an indispensable role in negative regulation of the Notch4-Hey1 pathway and is required for vascular development.

The Notch signaling pathway is evolutionarily conserved and essential both for pattern formation during development and for execution of a wide variety of cell fate decisions. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the Notch homolog LIN-12 ensures that only one of two undifferentiated gonadal cells develops into an anchor cell, whereas the other cell becomes a ventral uterine precursor cell (1Wu G.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Given that relatively small differences in the activity of the Notch signaling pathway result in marked differences in cell behavior, this pathway is strictly regulated by various mechanisms (3Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). The pathway is activated by interaction of the receptor Notch with Delta-like ligands presented on the surface of adjacent cells, which results in proteolytic cleavage of Notch and the consequent release of its intracellular domain (ICD) 1The abbreviations used are: ICD, intracellular domain; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; ES, embryonic stem; E, embryonic day; P-Sp, para-aortic splanchnopleural; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase. from the plasma membrane into the cytosol. The Notch ICD then migrates to the nucleus, forms a complex with the transcriptional suppressor CBF1 (also known as Su(H) or RBP-Jκ), and acts as a transcriptional activator of Notch target genes. Several recent studies have highlighted the importance of Notch signaling in vascular development. Endothelial cell precursors differentiate and coalesce into a network of uniformly sized primitive blood vessels, a process known as vasculogenesis, both in the embryo and in extraembryonic tissues such as the yolk sac during the early stages of mammalian vascular development. This primary vascular plexus is then remodeled by angiogenesis, a process that includes the sprouting, branching, splitting, and differential growth of vessels and that results in the formation of the large and small vessels of the mature vascular system (4Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 5Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). In mice, several Notch isoforms are expressed in endothelial cells of the embryonic vasculature (6Reaume A.G. Conlon R.A. Zirngibl R. Yamaguchi T.P. Rossant J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and both Notch1 loss-of-function mutant embryos and Notch1-Notch4 double mutant embryos manifest severe defects in angiogenic vascular remodeling (7Krebs L.T.

Expression of an activated form of Notch4 also results in abnormal vessel structure and patterning (8Uyttendaele H. Ho J. Rossant J. Kitajewski J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5643-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Notch signaling has been shown to control an arterial versus venous cell fate decision (9Zhong T.P. Childs S. Leu J.P.

A role for the Notch pathway in vascular homeostasis has also been suggested by the observation that the human degenerative vascular disease CADASIL is caused by missense mutations in the Notch3 gene (12Joutel A.

A ubiquitin-activating enzyme, with ATP as a substrate, catalyzes the formation of a thioester bond between itself and ubiquitin, and it then transfers the activated ubiquitin to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Certain ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes transfer ubiquitin directly to the protein substrate, whereas others require the participation of a third component, termed a ubiquitin ligase, to achieve this effect.

The human FBW7 gene has also been shown to be mutated in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines (18Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 25Oberg C. Li J. Pauley A. Wolf E. Gurney M. Lendahl U. J. Biol.

We now present genetic evidence that mouse Fbw7 is essential for normal vascular development as a result of its regulation of the abundance both of Notch4 and of the downstream effector Hey1. Construction of an Fbw7 Targeting Vector and Generation of Fbw7-/-Mice—Cloned DNA corresponding to the Fbw7 locus was isolated from a 129/Sv mouse genomic library (Stratagene). The targeting vector was constructed by replacing a 15-kb SwaI-HpaII fragment of genomic DNA containing exons 1-5 of Fbw7 with a PGK-lox-neo-poly(A) cassette. The vector thus contained 1.2- and 7.3-kb regions of homology located 5′ and 3′, respectively, relative to the neomycin resistance gene (neo). The PGK-tk-poly(A) cassette was ligated at the 3′ end of the targeting construct. The maintenance, transfection, and selection of ES cells were performed as described (27Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K.I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The recombination event was confirmed by Southern blot analysis with a 0.5-kb SpeI fragment of genomic DNA that flanked the 5′ homology region (Fig. 1A). The expected sizes of hybridizing fragments after digestion of genomic DNA with BglII and XbaI were 5.2 and 5.8 kb for the wild-type and mutant Fbw7 alleles, respectively. Mutant ES cells were microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts, and resulting male chimeras were mated with female C57BL/6 mice. The germ line transmission of the mutant allele was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to produce homozygous mutant animals. For genotyping of embryos, DNA was extracted from the yolk sac at E8.5 to E11.5 and analyzed by PCR with the primers RT16 (5′-GTAGGATGACAGTAATGAAAGTAG-3′), RT17 (5′-GACCGAGAACCCCAAGATTATTGG-3′), and PJL (5′-TGCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGACTGT-3′). Establishment of Fbw7-/-ES Cells—ES cells harboring the mutant Fbw7 allele were infected with a recombinant adenovirus that encodes the Cre recombinase in order to delete the neo cassette; deletion of the cassette was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. For the establishment of homozygous Fbw7 mutant ES cells, the cells were then re-transfected with the same targeting vector, selected with G418 and gancyclovir, and screened by PCR and Southern blot analysis. In Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry—Embryos were dissected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), embedded in OCT compound (Tissue Tek), and sectioned with a cryostat at a thickness of 5-8 μm. In situ hybridization was performed with the Ventana HX system. The Fbw7 riboprobe, corresponding to nucleotides 108-737 of the mouse Fbw7 cDNA, was synthesized with a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (28Shirane M. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) with monoclonal anti-PECAM-1 (MEC13.3, Pharmingen) and polyclonal anti-cyclin E (M-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were detected with biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:800 dilution) together with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and diaminobenzidine (Sigma). Sections were examined with a differential interference contrast microscope. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization and Immunohistochemistry— Embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then bleached with H2O2. Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (29Osumi-Yamashita N. Kuratani S. Ninomiya Y. Aoki K. Iseki S. Chareonvit S. Doi H. Fujiwara M. Watanabe T. Eto K. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Hes5, Hes7, Uncx4.1, Hey1, Hey2, and HeyL riboprobes, each corresponding to the entire open reading frame of the corresponding cDNA, were synthesized with a DIG RNA labeling kit. For immunohistochemistry, embryos were first incubated for 20 min in blocking solution (PBS containing 1% normal goat serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2% skim milk, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Monoclonal anti-PECAM-1 was used at a dilution of 1:500. Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution) and diaminobenzidine. Embryos were examined with a dissection microscope. Immunoblot Analysis and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Embryos at E9.5 were lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis as described (30Hatakeyama S.

Cancer. 2000; 88: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), (Transduction Laboratories) and anti-α-tubulin (TU-01, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). In vitro assays for kinase activity associated with CDK2, cyclin A, or cyclin E were performed as described (27Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K.I. Cell. 1996; 85: 707-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar) with lysates of whole embryos (150 or 300 μg of protein for CDK2 and cyclins, respectively). Analysis of Notch Stability in ES Cells—An expression vector both encoding Notch4-ICD tagged with the Myc epitope and hexahistidine at its COOH terminus (Notch4-ICD-mycHis) and controlled by the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene promoter was introduced by transfection into Fbw7+/+ and Fbw7-/- ES cells. Alternatively, cells were transfected with a similar vector for Notch1-ICD tagged with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at its COOH terminus. After selection with puromycin (1 μg ml-1) for 7 days, the Notch4-ICD- or Notch1-ICD-expressing cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cycloheximide (final concentration, 100 μg ml-1) was then added to each well, and the cells were harvested at the indicated times thereafter for determination of the abundance of the recombinant proteins by immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10, Roche Applied Science) or anti-HA (HA11, Covance). In Vitro Culture of P-Sp Explants and PECAM-1 Staining—P-Sp explant culture on OP9 stromal cells and immunohistochemistry were performed as described previously (31Takakura N. Watanabe T. Suenobu S. Yamada Y. Noda T. Ito Y. Satake M. Suda T. Cell. 2000; 102: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 32Zhang X.Q. Takakura N. Oike Y. Inada T. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 98: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, after culture for 10 days, the tissue was fixed in situ with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The cultures were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1% normal goat serum and 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to block nonspecific sites. After incubation overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal anti-PECAM-1, the tissue was washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and diaminobenzidine. The cultures were finally examined with a dissection microscope. Generation of Fbw7-/-Mice—We generated mice deficient in Fbw7. The Fbw7 gene was disrupted in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by replacement of the first five exons (33Maruyama S. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Ishida N. Kawakami K. Nakayama K.I. Genomics. 2001; 78: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with a neo cassette (Fig. 1A). Heterozygous mice appeared normal, but no homozygous mutants were detected among 299 newborn animals generated from heterozygote crosses (Fig. 1B) even though the ratio of wild-type to heterozygous offspring was normal. The mutation thus appeared to be lethal in the homozygous state. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Fbw7 mRNA was localized predominantly to cells of the endothelial lineage, including immature mesenchymal cells of lateral plate mesoderm and endothelial cells of the atrium and major trunk arteries but was not apparent in the large veins of wild-type embryos at embryonic day (E) 9.5 (Fig. 1, C and D). The Fbw7 gene was not expressed in the neural tube of wild-type embryos at E9.5, even though it is highly expressed in the adult brain (16Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 33Maruyama S. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Ishida N. Kawakami K. Nakayama K.I. Genomics. 2001; 78: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). No hybridization signal was detected in Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 1E). Impaired Vascular Development in Fbw7-/-Mice—To determine the time at which the Fbw7 mutation becomes lethal, we examined embryos from Fbw7+/- intercrosses at various developmental stages. Most Fbw7-/- embryos had been resorbed by E11.5, but they were still recoverable at E10.5 (Fig. 2). Growth retardation, especially in the head region, was evident in all homozygous mutant embryos (n = 181) (Fig. 2, A-E). They were pale and anemic in appearance, and often exhibited pericardial edema and impaired closure of the neural tube. Somite formation appeared normal, with the exception that the gap between adjacent somites was slightly narrower, and their arrangement was slightly irregular in comparison with wild-type embryos (see Fig. 5, K and L). Both Notch1-/- (34Conlon R.A. Reaume A.G. Rossant J. Development. 1995; 121: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R.

Nature. 1997; 386: 717-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) embryos exhibit severe abnormalities of somite patterning.Fig. 5Accumulation of Hey1 mRNA in Fbw7-/- embryos. Both Fbw7+/+ (A, C, E, G, I, and K) and Fbw7-/- (B, D, F, H, J, and L) embryos at E9.5 were subjected to whole mount in situ hybridization with probes specific for Hes5 (A and B), Hes7 (C and D), Hey1 (E and F), Hey2 (G and H), HeyL (I and J), or Uncx4.1 (K and L) mRNAs. The amount of Hey1 mRNA was increased in Fbw7-/- embryos, especially along the dorsal aorta (arrowheads in F) compared with that in Fbw7+/+ embryos. Scale bar, 500 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The vascular networks of Fbw7-/- embryos were generally less complex than were those of wild-type embryos. We immunostained the vessels of Fbw7+/+ and Fbw7-/- embryos with antibodies to (anti-) PECAM-1, a marker of endothelial cells. The tree-like vascular networks apparent in the brain of Fbw7+/+ embryos (Fig. 2D) failed to form in Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 2E). Rather, the homozygous mutants exhibited plexus-like vascular networks, and vessels in the brain periphery either did not develop or degenerated. Many Fbw7-/- embryos also manifested intracranial hemorrhage (Fig. 2, B and C), presumably as a result of the compromised integrity of the endothelial wall of the abnormal vessels. The deficit in vascular remodeling was most evident in the yolk sac vasculature. Extensive remodeling, resulting in the formation of large and small vessels, takes place in the yolk sac of wild-type embryos (Fig. 2F). However, although the honeycomb-like vascular plexus appeared to form normally at E8.5 in Fbw7-/- embryos, it remained largely unchanged across most of the surface of the yolk sac at E10.5 (Fig. 2G), suggesting that Fbw7 is essential for the remodeling of these vessels. Furthermore, formation of the major veins, including the anterior cardinal vein, was severely impaired in Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 2, H and I). To confirm that the vascular phenotype of Fbw7-/- embryos was not a secondary effect of a general failure in embryonic development, we studied in vitro para-aortic splanchnopleural (P-Sp) explant cultures, which support the growth of endothelial cells (31Takakura N. Watanabe T. Suenobu S. Yamada Y. Noda T. Ito Y. Satake M. Suda T. Cell. 2000; 102: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 32Zhang X.Q. Takakura N. Oike Y. Inada T. Gale N.W. Yancopoulos G.D. Suda T. Blood. 2001; 98: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). P-Sp explants from E9.5 Fbw7+/+ and Fbw7-/- embryos were co-cultured with OP9 stromal cells and then immunostained with anti-PECAM-1. The formation of an extensive PECAM-1-positive vascular network apparent in the Fbw7+/+ P-Sp explants was almost completely inhibited in the Fbw7-/- P-Sp explants (Fig. 3), suggesting that the failure of normal vascular development in Fbw7-/- embryos is attributable to a defect in endothelial cells or supporting tissues, not to a general retardation of embryonic growth. Accumulation of Notch4 in Fbw7-/-Mice—Given that the phenotype of Fbw7-/- mice is similar to those of mutant zebrafish or mice in which Notch signaling is impaired, we hypothesized that accumulation of the Notch ICD, a potential target for Fbw7-mediated ubiquitylation, is responsible for the abnormal vascular development in Fbw7-/- embryos. We therefore examined the expression of Notch1-4, all of which are thought to be important for normal vascular development (7Krebs L.T. Xue Y. Norton C.R. Shutter J.R. Maguire M. Sundberg J.P.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5643-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), in Fbw7-/- embryos. The abundance of the ICDs of Notch1-3 did not appear to be affected by the Fbw7 mutation, whereas that of Notch4-ICD was markedly increased in Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 4A). The amount of Notch4-ICD in Fbw7+/- embryos appeared to be intermediate between that in Fbw7+/+ and that in Fbw7-/- embryos. To evaluate the turnover rate of Notch4-ICD, we generated ES cells in which both Fbw7 alleles were disrupted and then transfected both these cells and wild-type cells with expression vectors for Notch1-ICD or Notch4-ICD. The rate of degradation of Notch1-ICD was similar in Fbw7+/+ and Fbw7-/- ES cells, whereas the turnover of Notch4-ICD was markedly slower in Fbw7-/- cells than in Fbw7+/+ cells (Fig. 4B). These data thus suggest that Fbw7 is required for proteolysis of Notch4-ICD but not for that of Notch1-ICD. Expression of an Fbw7 mutant (Fbw7WD) that lacks the NH2-terminal and F-box domains was shown previously (26Wu G. Lyapina S. Das I. Li J. Gurney M. Pauley A. Chui I. Deshaies R.J. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7403-7415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) to result in accumulation of both Notch1-ICD and Notch4-ICD in Bosc23 cells. We performed similar experiments with HEK293T cells, and we found that the expression of Fbw7WD induced the accumulation of Notch4-ICD but not that of Notch1-ICD (Fig. 4C). Although the reason for this discrepancy with regard to Notch1-ICD is unclear, the difference in the cell lines studied might be a contributing factor. We also found that the abundance of presenilin did not differ between Fbw7+/+ and Fbw7-/- embryos (data not shown). Enhanced Expression of Hey1 in Fbw7-/-Mice—We next examined the expression of members of the Hes and Hey families, downstream components of the Notch signaling pathway, by whole mount in situ hybridization (Fig. 5). Whereas the abundance of Hes5, Hes7, Hey2, HeyL, and Uncx4.1 mRNAs in Fbw7-/- embryos was almost identical to that in Fbw7+/+ embryos, the amount of Hey1 mRNA was markedly increased in the vessels of Fbw7-/- embryos compared with that in the vessels of Fbw7+/+ embryos. The accumulation of Notch4-ICD in Fbw7-/- embryos may thus lead to increased expression of Hey1 and a consequent effect on vascular development. Normal Expression of Cyclin E in Fbw7-/-Mice—Given that biochemical and genetic evidence in Drosophila suggests that cyclin E is a target for Fbw7-mediated ubiquitylation and subsequent proteolysis (16Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 17Moberg K.H. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C. Haber D.A. Hariharan I.K.

Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), we also examined the expression of cyclin E in Fbw7-/- embryos. Neither immunoblot nor immunohistochemical analysis with specific antibodies detected accumulation of cyclin E in Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 6, A and C). Immunoblot analysis also revealed a similar abundance of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and p27Kip1 in Fbw7+/+, Fbw7+/-, and Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the kinase activity associated with CDK2, cyclin A, or cyclin E was not increased in Fbw7-/- embryos (Fig. 6B). In contrast, the abundance of cyclin E and p27Kip1 was greatly increased in Skp2-/- embryos (Fig. 6, A and C), consistent with our previous data (37Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.I. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Cyclin E may thus be subject to dual control by two F-box proteins, Fbw7 and Skp2, with Fbw7 being dispensable for the regulation of cyclin E abundance at least until the mid-stage of embryonic development. Notch signaling is implicated in vascular remodeling during embryonic development. Several isoforms of Notch are expressed in the developing vasculature (38Villa N. Walker L. Lindsell C.E. Gasson J.

https://openalex.org/W2113832930,"The number of vesicles released at excitatory synapses and the number of release sites per synaptic connection are key determinants of information processing in the cortex, yet they remain uncertain. Here we show that the number of functional release sites and the number of anatomically identified synaptic contacts are equal at connections between spiny stellate and pyramidal cells in rat barrel cortex. Moreover, our results indicate that the amount of transmitter released per synaptic contact is independent of release probability and the intrinsic release probability is high. These properties suggest that connections between layer 4 and layer 2/3 are tuned for reliable transmission of spatially distributed, timing-based signals."

Alternative low energy conformations of the membrane subunits were explored in a molecular dynamics simulation of the dimer embedded in a phospholipid bilayer.

The proximal quinone-binding site, located nearest the catalytic dimer, has a considerably more polar environment than the distal site. Alternative low energy conformations of the membrane subunits were explored in a molecular dynamics simulation of the dimer embedded in a phospholipid bilayer. The simulation offers insight into why Sdh4p Cys-78 may be serving as the second axial ligand for the heme instead of a histidine residue. We discuss the possible roles of heme and of the two quinone-binding sites in electron transport.

SDH couples the oxidation of succinate in the Krebs cycle to the reduction of ubiquinone (UQ) in the electron transport chain (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus P.R. Cecchini G. Muller F.

Membrane-bound fumarate reductases (FRD) or menaquinol:fumarate oxidoreductases, which are found in anaerobic organisms respiring with fumarate as terminal electron acceptor, are functionally and structurally related to SDH (2Cecchini G. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Maklashina E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Cole S.T. Condon C. Lemire B.D. Weiner J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Science. 1999; 284: 1941-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). FRD catalyzes the reduction of fumarate to succinate, the reverse of the SDH reaction. The structures of the Escherichia coli and the Wollinella succinogenes FRDs have been solved to resolutions of 2.7 and 2.2 Å, respectively (9Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 10Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). More recently, the structure of the E. coli SDH was solved to 2.6 Å resolution (11Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). SDH and FRD enzymes consist of a hydrophilic catalytic dimer that protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix or the bacterial cytoplasm and either one or two integral membrane subunits. Table I lists the subunit and cofactor compositions of the relevant enzymes. The catalytic dimers are comprised of two subunits that exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation across species and as expected, the structures of the catalytic subunits are very similar. The larger subunit carries a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), while the smaller subunit contains three iron-sulfur clusters. In contrast, the membrane portions of SDH and FRD enzymes show considerable variability in the primary structures of their subunits and in cofactor composition (3Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 7Hägerhäll C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the E. coli SDH and FRD enzymes, two hydrophobic subunits are present. The E. coli FRD was crystallized without heme and with two bound menaquinone molecules, while the E. coli SDH was crystallized with one heme and one ubiquinone. The W. succinogenes FRD has a single membrane subunit, which contains two hemes, but the crystals did not contain any bound quinone. Although, this latter enzyme is known to oxidize quinone, the positions of any quinone-binding sites have yet to be determined. The structures of the membrane subunits of each enzyme are considerably different, although in all three x-ray structures, four antiparallel helices form a central helix bundle. It is not possible to superimpose the membrane subunits without changing the position, orientation, and tilt of the transmembrane helices (12Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Schröder I. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The variability among membrane subunits and the cofactors they harbor are major determinants of the distinct properties of SDH and FRD enzymes in different biological systems.Table IThe subunit and cofactor compositions of SDH and FRD enzymes from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and W. succinogenesEnzymeaThe enzyme name is followed by the PDB entry code in parentheses.Flavoprotein subunit and cofactorsIron-sulfur subunit and cofactorsMembrane subunit(s) and cofactorsbOnly cofactors present in the PDB files are listed.E. coli SDH (1NEK)SdhA FADSdhB [2Fe-2S] [3Fe-4S] [4Fe-4S]SdhC, SdhD ubiquinone hemeE. coli FRD (1LOV)FrdA FADFrdB [2Fe-2S] [3Fe-4S] [4Fe-4S]FrdC, FrdD 2 menaquinoneW. succinogenes FRD (1QLA)FrdA FADFrdB [2Fe-2S] [3Fe-4S] [4Fe-4S]FrdC 2 hemeS. cerevisiae SDH (this work)Sdh1p FADSdh2p [2Fe-2S] [3Fe-4S] [4Fe-4S]Sdh3p, Sdh4p 2 ubiquinone hemea The enzyme name is followed by the PDB entry code in parentheses.b Only cofactors present in the PDB files are listed.

The striking variability of clinical presentations associated with SDH mutations and a possible role for the enzyme in aging have greatly stimulated interest in understanding the protein structure and the molecular mechanisms that elicit disease. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDH is a tetrameric (Sdh1p-Sdh4p), single-heme containing enzyme that has been extensively studied as a model for the mitochondrial enzymes (5Lemire B.D. Oyedotun K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Based on the kinetics of inhibition by the quinone analog, sec-butyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (s-BDNP) and on mutagenesis studies, the yeast enzyme is proposed to harbor two non-equivalent quinone-binding sites (18Oyedotun K.S.

In addition, an unusual extension of the Sdh4p carboxyl terminus is essential for the optimal catalysis of quinone reduction and for the assembly of a stable holoenzyme (20Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31382-31388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this report, we present a model for the quaternary structure of the S. cerevisiae SDH. FAD, iron-sulfur clusters, heme b, quinones, and the quinone analog inhibitor, s-BDNP, were docked into the yeast structure. In addition, we used molecular dynamics on the membrane dimer embedded in a hydrated phospholipid bilayer to investigate Sdh4p Cys-78, which may serve as an unusual heme axial ligand. We discuss the possible role of heme b and the involvement of two quinone-binding sites in electron transport. Model Building—The structure of the SDH apoenzyme was constructed by homology modeling using the program Modeler6v2 (22Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 23Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Templates used for modeling were the E. coli SDH, the E. coli FRD, and the W. succinogenes FRD (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry codes 1NEK, 1LOV, and 1QLA, respectively). Templates and target sequences were aligned using ClustalW (25Higgins D. Thompson J. Gibson T. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55389) Google Scholar) and manually optimized in the Swiss-Pdb Viewer v3.7 (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9503) Google Scholar, 27Guex N. Diemand A. Peitsch M.C. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 1997; 267: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 30Sippl J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) of template-sequence alignments. Since the flavoprotein and the iron-sulfur subunits have high sequence identities (Table II), all three templates (1NEK, 1QLA, and 1LOV) were used for modeling the catalytic dimer. However, it is not possible to model the membrane subunits in this way due to the low primary sequence conservation (3Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 7Hägerhäll C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Of the three structures, 1NEK (11Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) provided the best template for modeling the yeast membrane dimer. Alignments of the membrane subunits were guided by the positions of the three transmembrane segments for each subunit (18Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23956-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16936-16943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the heme ligands, and conserved residues that may interact with ubiquinone (Fig. 1). For the Sdh3p alignment with the E. coli SdhC (Fig. 1A), an alternative alignment that introduced three additional identities was rejected because it resulted in the disruption of the second transmembrane helix. None of the three new identities involved conserved amino acids that could be identified in a multiple sequence alignment of over 60 Sdh3p related sequences (not shown). An ensemble of 10 structures, nine of which were clustered (rmsd < 0.5 Å), was generated, and the one with the lowest objective function (energy) was chosen for further analysis.Table IIPrimary sequence identities among SDHs and FRDs from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and W. succinogenesS. cerevisiae Sdh1pS. cerevisiae Sdh2pS. cerevisiae Sdh3pS. cerevisiae Sdh4pE. coli SdhA53aValues represent percent sequence identities.E. coli FrdA39W. succinogenes FrdA34E. coli SdhB51E. coli FrdB32W. succinogenes FrdB29E. coli SdhC23E. coli SdhD12a Values represent percent sequence identities. Open table in a new tab None of the three templates used for modeling provides any structural information for building the Sdh4p C terminus (residues 127-150). Secondary structure analysis suggests that residues 127-144 are slightly amphipathic with a hydrophobic moment of 5.23. We searched for compatible templates to use in modeling using the “scan loop data base” command of the Swiss-Pdb Viewer. The template with the lowest energy (GROMOS96 force field) and maximum sequence similarity was selected, modeled, and connected to the Sdh4p C terminus with the program O v8.0 (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) using Gly-126 as a flexible hinge. The model was energy-minimized (100 cycles of steepest descent) using GROMACS v3.1.1 (32Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7089) Google Scholar, 33Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Mod. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). We guided the placement of the C-terminal segment with the results of our mutagenesis studies, which indicated that Lys-132 may interact with Asp-67 (21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The coordinates for the model (PDB entry code 1PB4) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ (www.rcsb.org/). The Sdh1p, Sdh2p, Sdh3p, and Sdh4p subunits correspond to chains A-D in the model, respectively. Ligand and Macromolecule Setup—Coordinates for ubiquinone-2 (UQ2) and heme b (HEM) were obtained from the HIC-Up hetero-compound server (34Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The initial coordinates of the quinone analog inhibitor s-BDNP were generated with the program CORINA (35Gasteiger J. Rudolph C. Sadowski J. Tetrahedron Comp. Method. 1990; 3: 537-547Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar) and energy-minimized with GROMACS v3.1.1 (32Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7089) Google Scholar, 33Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Mod. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar). Docking—The locations of FAD, the three iron-sulfur clusters, and heme b were determined by superimposition with 1NEK using the program Modeler6v2. Docking of UQ and its inhibitor analog, s-BDNP, into the SDH model (the flavoprotein subunit was removed since it does not contribute to the formation of the quinone or heme binding sites) was performed with the program Autodock v3.0.5 (36Goodsell D.S. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar, 37Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J.

Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 39Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9042) Google Scholar), using the graphical front-end AutoDockTools. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was used to perform an automated molecular docking (39Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9042) Google Scholar). Parameters for the number of generations, energy evaluations, and docking runs were set to 27,000, 250,000, and 50, respectively. The docked protein-ligand complexes were evaluated on the basis of interaction energy combined with geometrical matching of the ligands with functional residues at the docking site. Polar hydrogens and partial charges for SDH residues and cofactors were assigned in AutoDockTools using the Kollman United Atom and Gasteiger charges, respectively. Flexible torsions in the cofactors were assigned with AutoTors and all dihedral angles were allowed to rotate freely. In general, these were all acyclic, non-terminal single bonds (excluding amide bonds) in a given ligand molecule. Affinity grid fields were generated, using the auxiliary program AutoGrid. For docking into the proximal quinone-binding site (QP), the grid field was centered at the middle of SDH, while for docking into the distal quinone-binding site (QD), the grid field was centered at the lower half of the macromolecule. The positioning of the grid fields was guided by the results of mutagenesis studies of the quinone-binding sites (18Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23956-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16936-16943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For UQ2 docking, the grid was a 60 Å cube with grid points separated by 0.375 Å. For s-BDNP docking, the grid was a 37.5 Å cube with grid points separated by 0.375 Å. The cofactors were initially placed at a random position away from the docking site. Binding Free Energy Prediction—Free energies of binding were estimated using the empirical scoring function included in AutoDock (39Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9042) Google Scholar). The scoring function included the van der Waals interaction represented as a Lennard-Jones 6-12 dispersion/repulsion term, the hydrogen bonding represented as a directional 12-10 term, and the Coulombic electrostatic potential. The scoring function was further refined by including desolvation and entropic terms and empirically-calibrated coefficients derived from regression analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes whose structures are known at high resolutions. Model Evaluation and Validation—The Modeler energy function was used to assess the degree of violation of the template-derived restraints. Stereochemical evaluations were performed with the program PROCHECK v3.4.4 (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 41Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). Quality evaluation of the model was done by the program ProsaII (29Melo F. Feytmans E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which relies on statistical potentials involving single residues and pairs of residues (mean force potentials). When evaluation tools indicated problems with the model, it was recalculated after the manual repositioning of side chains or the editing of a region of the alignment. Molecular Dynamics—Molecular dynamics simulation was performed in GROMACS v3.1.1 (32Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7089) Google Scholar, 33Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Mod. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) with the GROMOS87 force field. The flavoprotein subunit was not used in the simulation since it does not directly contact the Sdh3p and Sdh4p subunits. The polypeptides were solvated in a rectangular box filled with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and simple point charge (SPC) waters. The starting model for the lipid bilayer is a pre-equilibrated box of 128 solvated DPPC molecules (dppc128; Ref. 42Tieleman D.P. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Chem. Phys. 1996; 105: 4871-4880Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Briefly, an empty rectangular box (130 Å × 125 Å × 68 Å) with the protein positioned in the center was generated using the “editconf” command of GROMACS. The box was then filled with dppc128, using the “genbox” command. The resulting simulation box contained 484 DPPC molecules (about 242 molecules in each leaflet) solvated on both sides with SPC water. The total system contained ∼80,000 atoms. Periodic boundary conditions were employed to avoid edge effects. After solvation, the simulation system was energy-minimized with 300 iterations of the steepest descent algorithm to remove bad van der Waals contacts. These configurations served as the starting structures for 500 ps position-restraint simulations in which the protein was harmonically restrained with an isotropic force constant of 1000 kJ·mol-1·nm-2. This allows further equilibration of the bilayer and solvent, while keeping the conformation of the protein unchanged. The bilayer, solvent, and peptides were separately coupled to the temperature and pressure baths. Constant temperature and pressure were maintained at 300 K and 100 kPa using the weak coupling technique (43Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23125) Google Scholar) with coupling and relaxation parameters of 0.1 and 1.0 ps, respectively. The van der Waals interactions were modeled using a 6-12 Lennard-Jones potential, cutoff at 1.0 nm, with the first and second neighbor exclusions and scaled third neighbor Lennard-Jones coefficients. Electrostatic interactions were included via the particle mesh Ewald summation (44Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (20443) Google Scholar, 45Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8592Crossref Scopus (15348) Google Scholar) with a cut-off of 0.9 nm for the real space calculation and a fast Fourier transform algorithm for the reciprocal space calculation. All covalent bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm to allow a time step of 2 fs. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a cluster of 6 processors running Red Hat Linux 7.2 patched with MOSIX v1.9.0 (46Barak A. La'adan O. J. Futur. Gener. Comp. Sys. 1998; 13: 361-372Crossref Google Scholar). Simulations lasted for 5 ns, with the first nanosecond taken for equilibration. Trajectories were taken every 50 ps and visualized using VMD v1.7.2 (47Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14.1: 33-38Crossref Scopus (37445) Google Scholar). A Model of the S. cerevisiae SDH—Fig. 2A depicts the structural model of the S. cerevisiae SDH constructed by Modeler, which generates structures by the satisfaction of spatial restraints (22Fiser A. Do R.K. Sali A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1753-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 23Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar, 24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10447) Google Scholar). It extracts distance and dihedral angle restraints on the target sequence from its alignment with the template structures. These template-derived restraints, in combination with the CHARMM force field, were used to obtain a full objective function. Optimization of the target function with conjugate gradient and simulated annealing via molecular dynamics leads to a model that best satisfies all the spatial restraints. In the model, the structures of the Sdh1p and Sdh2p subunits closely resemble the structures of the templates (Fig. 2B). The model of the catalytic dimer is an average structure based on restraints derived from the three coordinate sets, E. coli SDH (11Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), E. coli FRD (10Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), and W. succinogenes FRD (9Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Several attempts were made to model the anchor subunits using the three available coordinate sets as templates. However, this approach failed due to the differences in the position, orientation, tilt, and number (in the case of W. succinogenes FRD) of transmembrane helices. The crystal structure of the E. coli SDH shows that SdhC Arg-31 is within 4 Å of UQ, while SdhD Tyr-83 is hydrogen bonded to the UQ. Interestingly, these residues are conserved in the S. cerevisiae SDH subunits (Fig. 1, A and B). Using these residues, the predicted heme ligands, and the observed transmembrane segments as guides, we generated sequence alignments of the membrane subunits (Fig. 1 and Refs. 18Oyedotun K.S.

The result is a model quality that is comparable to the E. coli SDH (root mean square deviation of 0.62 Å (Fig. 2B) for 4040 backbone atoms as determined with the program Swiss-Pdb viewer). The stereochemistry of the model is as good as those of the starting templates (Table III).Table IIIPROCHECK Ramachandran scores for t"
https://openalex.org/W2086588053,"Vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are a family of highly conserved proton pumps that couple hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton transport out of the cytosol. How ATP is supplied for V-ATPase-mediated hydrolysis and for coupling of proton transport is poorly understood. We have reported that the glycolytic enzyme aldolase physically associates with V-ATPase (Lu, M., Holliday, L. S., Zhang, L., Dunn, W. A., and Gluck, S. L. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 30407–30413). Here we show that aldolase interacts with three different subunits of V-ATPase (subunits a, B, and E). The binding sites for the V-ATPase subunits on aldolase appear to be on distinct interfaces of the glycolytic enzyme. Aldolase deletion mutant cells were able to grow in medium buffered at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.5, displaying a growth phenotype similar to that observed in V-ATPase subunit deletion mutants. Abnormalities in V-ATPase assembly and protein expression observed in aldolase deletion mutant cells could be fully rescued by aldolase complementation. The interaction between aldolase and V-ATPase increased dramatically in the presence of glucose, suggesting that aldolase may act as a glucose sensor for V-ATPase regulation. Taken together, these findings provide functional evidence that the ATP-generating glycolytic pathway is directly coupled to the ATP-hydrolyzing proton pump through physical interaction between aldolase and V-ATPase. Vacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are a family of highly conserved proton pumps that couple hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to proton transport out of the cytosol.

They reside on intracellular membranes of all eukaryotic cells and are essential for the normal functions of secretory vesicles, the trans-Golgi network, endosomes, lysosomes, and the yeast vacuole (1Forgac M.

Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In some specialized cells such as kidney epithelial cells and osteoclasts, V-ATPases reside at high levels on the plasma membrane where they are responsible for transepithelial or cellular proton transport required for normal acid-base homeostasis or bone remodeling (2Gluck S.L. Underhill D.M. Iyori M. Holliday L.S. Kostrominova T.Y. Lee B.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 427-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although V-ATPases consume ATP in these cellular processes, the mechanism for coupling of activity to metabolism is poorly understood. V-ATPase consists of two macrodomains, V1, a catalytic sector, composed of peripheral membrane proteins, and V0, a transmembrane sector, composed of intrinsic membrane proteins, that transmits protons through the lipid bilayer (4Kane P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The V1 sector attaches at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane to the V0 sector. Dissociated V1 and V0 sectors of V-ATPase in yeast are present in a dynamic equilibrium with the fully assembled proton pump (4Kane P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ATP-driven proton transport requires structural and functional coupling of the V1 and V0 sectors. The dissociated V1 sector lacks ATP hydrolytic activity, and the free V0 sector does not form an open proton pore (5Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, the coupling of the V1 and V0 sectors is governed by glucose availability. In cells grown in glucose, the V1 and V0 sectors are assembled into V-ATPase (6Kane P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon glucose deprivation, V1 dissociates from V0. A panel of yeast mutants with deficiencies in the Ras-cAMP pathway, the main glucose repression/derepression pathway, and the respiratory pathway has been investigated (7Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V-ATPase was found to assemble normally in all the yeast mutant strains tested, suggesting that glucose-induced assembly of V-ATPase is independent of these pathways (7Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycolytic pathway comprises nine enzymatic steps that convert one glucose molecule with six carbon atoms into two molecules of pyruvate, each with three carbon atoms. At the end of glycolysis, the ATP balance sheet shows a net profit of two ATP molecules/glucose molecule. For most animal cells, glycolysis is only a prelude to the citric acid cycle since the pyruvic acid quickly enters the mitochondria to be completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O. However, in yeast such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycolysis is the preferred metabolic pathway for ATP generation (8Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1989: 41-86Google Scholar). Instead of being degraded in mitochondria, the pyruvate molecules generated in yeast cells stay in the cytosol and are converted into ethanol and CO2, which is then excreted. Although yeast cells can utilize a variety of carbon sources, they use up the available glucose before turning to alternative fuels (9Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Addition of glucose to carbon-starved yeast cells or cells growing on a nonfermentable carbon source results in two major changes in enzymatic activities and gene expression. First, glucose represses expression of genes encoding proteins in the respiratory pathway and enzymes for utilization of alternative carbon sources. Second, glucose induces expression of genes required for glucose utilization, including genes encoding glycolytic enzymes (9Rolland F. Winderickx J. Thevelein J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 310-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In a search for protein partners that interact with V-ATPase, we discovered that the glycolytic enzyme aldolase binds directly to V-ATPase (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In yeast cells deficient in aldolase, we observed complete disassembly and a dramatic reduction in the steady-state level of V-ATPase (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that yeast mutant cells deficient in aldolase display a growth phenotype similar to that observed in V-ATPase subunit deletion mutants. V-ATPase abnormalities observed in aldolase deletion mutant cells can be rescued to normal levels by aldolase complementation. These data provide functional evidence that the glycolytic enzyme aldolase regulates V-ATPase assembly, protein expression, and activity by physical association with the proton pump. Materials—The high fidelity Expand Long enzyme system was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The yeast expression vector YC2/CT and polyclonal rabbit antiserum against aldolase were from Invitrogen.

Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—High fidelity PCR was performed to amplify a cDNA fragment coding for 389 aa at the amino terminus that represents the cytoplasmic portion of the human a4 subunit of V-ATPase using the forward primer 5′-ATGGCGTCTGTGTTTCGAAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GTAGCTGCCGACACCATAG-3′. The cDNA fragment that corresponds to the 100 aa at the amino terminus of the human B1 subunit of V-ATPase was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-ATGGAGATAGACAGCAGGCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CATCGATCCCTGATGTCC-3′. The cDNA fragment that corresponds to the 100 aa at the carboxyl terminus of the human B1 subunit of V-ATPase was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-ACCAGCTGTACGCCTGCTATG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TAGAGCGCAGTGTCAG-3′. The amplified cDNA fragments were cloned in-frame with the GAL-4 DNA binding domain on the yeast expression vector pAS2-1 (Clontech). PJ69 yeast cells harboring three reporter genes for adenine, histidine, and β-galactosidase were transformed with the cDNA constructs and spread onto 100-mm plates of minimum synthetic medium lacking tryptophan (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Colonies of yeast cells were allowed to grow for 4 days and harvested for subsequent transformation with a human kidney cDNA expression library fused in-frame with the GAL-4 activation domain in the vector pACT2 (Clontech). After selection for growth on adenine–/Leu–/Trp– triple dropout plates, positive clones were streaked on His–/Leu–/Trp– dropout plates in the presence of 1 mm 3-aminotriazole and subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase activity. Analysis of the positive colonies was carried out as described previously (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown overnight to stationary phase. DNA was isolated and introduced into bacteria by electroporation. DNA sequencing was carried out by incubation with BigDye Terminators and read by an automatic DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The derived DNA sequences were analyzed by searching the GenBank™ data base for homology to known DNA and peptide sequences. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Precipitation Assays—The cytoplasmic portion of the human a4 subunit of V-ATPase was amplified by high fidelity PCR as described above using the forward primer 5′-AATTGGATCCATGGCTCTCAGCGATGCTGACGTGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GAGAGAATTCGTCCAAAAACTTCCTGTTGGCATTTGC-3′. A 150-aa cDNA fragment from the amino terminus of the human B1 subunit of V-ATPase was amplified using the forward primer 5′-ATGGAGATAGACAGCAGGCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTGGCCATTGATATCCAG-3′. The amplified PCR products were purified with QIAEX II beads (Qiagen), digested with restriction enzymes, purified again with QIAEX II beads, and cloned in-frame into the GST expression vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences). Clones containing the fusion constructs were identified by DNA minipreparation and restriction enzyme digestion and verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of the fusion proteins was performed as described previously (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly bacterial colonies were inoculated into LB medium containing ampicillin and grown for 16 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. The cultures were diluted 1:10 and grown for 3 h, isopropylthiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and incubation was continued for 1 h. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell lysis was carried out by sonication (Sonic Dismembrater, Fisher Scientific) for 2 × 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% to minimize aggregation of the fusion protein with bacterial proteins. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected, mixed with a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were collected by centrifugation and incubated with 35S-labeled aldolase in Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) at 4 °C for 3 h with shaking. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed five times in Nonidet P-40 buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 3 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were dried for autoradiography analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Yeast cells were grown in supplemented minimal medium lacking methionine, harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in pretreatment buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and incubated for 5 min. Spheroplasts were generated by treatment with zymolyase 100T (ICN) for 20 min in SPC buffer (1% glucose, 1 m sorbitol, 50 mm K2HPO4, 16 mm citric acid, pH 5.8), labeled with [35S]methionine for 60 min, lysed in solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether) for 15 min and incubated with the anti-B subunit antibody 13D11 (Molecular Probes) for 60 min. After another 60-min incubation with protein A-agarose beads, the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times, and incubated for 5 min at 70 °C in 50 μl of cracking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography analysis. Quantitation of the V0 and V1 subunits was performed using a densitometer. Vacuolar membrane vesicles were prepared from midlog phase yeast cells as described previously (11Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38409-38415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out by separating V-ATPase immunoprecipitates on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus and transferring electrophoretically to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated to block nonspecific binding in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with gentle agitation for 1 h at room temperature. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against aldolase was diluted 1:1000 in TTBS and applied to the membranes for 1 h. After washing with TTBS, the membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in TTBS for 1 h, washed five times in TTBS, and incubated with SuperSignal West Dura Substrate working solution (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ATPase and Proton Translocating Activities—Bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATP hydrolysis of vacuolar membranes was assayed by measuring the production of inorganic phosphate as described previously (11Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38409-38415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly vacuolar membrane vesicles in ATPase buffer (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm azide, pH 6.75) were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1. The reaction was initiated by addition of ATP in a final concentration of 3 mm and stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid. The samples were extracted with chloroform to remove lipid and detergent. After centrifugation, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to clean test tubes and incubated with buffers containing ascorbic acid and ammonium molybdate. The concentration of inorganic phosphate was measured by a spectrophotometer at 700 nm and converted to rate of ATP hydrolysis. Proton transport activity was measured by ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence spectrometer with excitation at 493 nm and emission at 545 nm (11Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38409-38415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm acridine orange, and 5 mm MgCl2 in the presence and absence of bafilomycin A1. ATP was added at a final concentration of 5 mm to initiate transport. The Glycolytic Enzyme Aldolase Interacts with Three Distinct Subunits of V-ATPase—We previously detected interaction between aldolase and the E subunit of V-ATPase (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To search for protein molecules that interact with other subunits of V-ATPase, we carried out yeast two-hybrid assays using the a and B subunits of V-ATPase as baits, respectively. Subunit a is an integral membrane protein possessing an amino-terminal hydrophilic domain and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain containing multiple membrane-spanning segments (12Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42382-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 389 aa at the amino terminus that represent the cytoplasmic portion of the a4 subunit was cloned as the bait. The catalytic “head” of V-ATPase consists of three pairs of A and B subunits arrayed as a hexagon. The A subunit is the site of ATP hydrolysis, and the B subunit may have a regulatory role (16Adachi I. Arai H. Pimental R. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 960-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wang Z.Q. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21957-21965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The central portion of the B subunit is believed to be required for binding to the A subunit. To maximize chances for identification of protein molecules that may regulate V-ATPase but are not elements of the core structure of the enzyme, we cloned two regions, 100 aa each, from the amino and carboxyl termini of the B subunit as baits. Screening a human kidney cDNA expression library identified the glycolytic enzyme aldolase to interact with the a subunit and the B amino-terminal fragment but not with the B carboxyl-terminal fragment (Table I). Taken together, aldolase interacts with the a, B, and E subunits of V-ATPase. These interactions were confirmed by GST precipitation assays (Fig. 1A).Table IAldolase interacts with the a, B, and E subunits of V-ATPase on distinct interfacesAldolase deletion mutantspAS2-apAS2-B-NpAS2-B-CpAS2-EAldolase-(1-364)++-+Aldolase-(108-364)++--Aldolase-(121-364)+---Aldolase-(126-364)+---Aldolase-(163-364)+---Aldolase-(188-364)+--- Open table in a new tab Furthermore our data indicate that distinct domains exist on aldolase for interactions with the a, B, and E subunits of V-ATPase (Table I). When the cytoplasmic portion of the a subunit was used as the bait for two-hybrid assays, clones representing a wide spectrum of mutations in aldolase were identified, ranging from the full-length cDNA of 364 aa to cDNAs with deletions up to the 187 aa from the amino terminus. Thus, the 177 aa at the carboxyl terminus of aldolase is sufficient for interaction with the a subunit. As for the domain in aldolase required for interaction with the B subunit of V-ATPase, our two-hybrid assay identified the full-length aldolase cDNA and clones with deletions up to 107 aa from the amino terminus of aldolase. Clones with deletions beyond the 107 aa from the amino terminus that interact with the a subunit failed to bind to the B subunit. In contrast, aldolase deletion mutants over a wide spectrum of amino acids failed to show any interaction with the E subunit, suggesting that the entire aldolase protein was required to fold in a particular configuration for interaction with the E subunit (Table I). These observations were further confirmed by GST precipitation assays (Fig. 1, B–D). Simultaneous interactions of aldolase with the a, B, and E subunits of V-ATPase were further confirmed by in vitro binding assays (Fig. 1, E–H). In the absence of aldolase, no binding was detected among V-ATPase subunits (Fig. 1, F–H), suggesting that the interactions occur directly through aldolase. Our findings that aldolase binds to both the V1 and V0 subunits of V-ATPase support the notion that aldolase may act as a nucleus in assembly of V1 and V0 sectors into the V-ATPase holoenzyme. Aldolase Deletion Mutant Cells Display a Growth Phenotype Similar to That Observed in the V-ATPase Subunit Deletion Mutants—Previous studies showed that deletion of individual c, B, or E subunits of V-ATPase disrupted V-ATPase assembly and resulted in undetectable levels of ATP hydrolytic and proton transport activities (18Foury F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18554-18560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking the c, B, or E subunit of V-ATPase, however, were able to grow on culture plates buffered at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.5, most likely due to abnormalities in cytosolic calcium homeostasis resulting in a lethal phenotype at high extracellular pH (20Ohya Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38245-38253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between aldolase and V-ATPase activity, we examined the growth pattern of a yeast mutant strain deficient in aldolase (22Lobo Z J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 222-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aldolase deletion mutant strain, fba1, expressed undetectable levels of aldolase protein (Fig. 2A) and displayed aldolase enzymatic activity below 2% of that observed in wild-type cells (22Lobo Z J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 222-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aldolase mutant cells were able to grow on culture plates buffered at pH 5.5 but not at pH 7.5 (Fig. 2B), displaying a growth phenotype similar to that observed in the V-ATPase subunit deletion mutants. In contrast, mutant cells deficient in the glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase were found to grow on culture plates buffered at both pH 5.5 and pH 7.5 (Fig. 2B), consistent with our previous observation that the assembly and expression of V-ATPase were much less affected in these mutant cells (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results support the notion that aldolase deficiency results in V-ATPase malfunction by disrupting the physical association between aldolase and V-ATPase. Restoration of V-ATPase Assembly, Protein Expression, and Activity to Normal Levels by Aldolase Complementation—Since aldolase physically interacts with V-ATPase in vivo and deletion of the aldolase gene results in complete disassembly and a 3-fold reduction in the steady-state level of V-ATPase (10Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we examined whether the V-ATPase abnormalities observed in aldolase deletion mutant cells could be restored to normal levels by aldolase complementation. The open reading frame coding for the yeast aldolase gene was amplified by high fidelity PCR. The amplified cDNA fragment was verified by DNA sequencing and subsequently cloned into the expression vector pYC2/CT (Invitrogen), which is designed for inducible expression of recombinant proteins in S. cerevisiae. The vector contains the galactose-inducible GAL-1 promoter and harbors the CEN6 origin for non-integrative centromeric maintenance and low copy replication of the plasmid (generally one to two copies per cell). Aldolase deletion mutant cells were transformed with the aldolase-containing expression vector. The transformed cells were spread onto 100-mm culture plates containing 0.2% glucose and 2% galactose. Since the presence of glucose inhibits the growth of aldolase deletion mutant cells (22Lobo Z J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 222-226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aldolase-expressing colonies were selected by growth on glucose-containing plates and confirmed by Western blotting. The aldolase-expressing cells were subsequently examined for V-ATPase assembly and expression. Normal levels of assembly and protein expression of V-ATPase were observed as measured by immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the B subunit of V-ATPase, 13D11. Our data, therefore, demonstrate restoration of V-ATPase assembly and protein expression to normal levels in aldolase deletion mutant cells by aldolase complementation. To examine whether V-ATPase activity was also restored, we prepared vacuolar membrane vesicles as described previously (11Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38409-38415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and measured ATP hydrolytic activity that is sensitive to the specific inhibitor of V-ATPase, bafilomycin A1. ATP hydrolysis of vacuolar membrane vesicles was assayed by measuring the production of inorganic phosphate (11Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38409-38415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, aldolase complementation restored ATP hydrolysis to normal levels in the aldolase deletion mutant cells. The proton transport activity of V-ATPase was also measured by tracking the ATP-dependent quenching of acridine orange using a fluorescence spectrometer with excitation at 493 nm and emission at 545 nm (11Lu M. Vergara S. Zhang L. Holliday L.S. Aris J. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38409-38415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As expected, aldolase complementation restored V-ATPase proton transport activity to normal levels (Fig. 3B). Up-regulation of Aldolase-V-ATPase Interaction in the Presence of Glucose—Based on its interaction with the V1 domain of V-ATPase and genetic manipulation analysis, the RAVE complex was proposed to play a role in glucose-dependent assembly of V-ATPase (23Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Further studies, however, demonstrated that the interaction between RAVE and V1 was not glucose-sensitive, consistent with a constitutive rather than a regulatory role for the RAVE complex in V-ATPase assembly (24Smardon A.M.

A soluble form of betaglycan can be released by proteolytic cleavage (also known as shedding) of the membrane-bound form, yielding soluble betaglycan. The mechanism leading to the generation of soluble betaglycan is poorly understood. Because the membrane and soluble forms of betaglycan have opposite effects regulating the availability of TGF-β, it is important to characterize the shedding of betaglycan further.

Overexpression of MT1-MMP in COS-1 cells, which do not express detectable levels of this metalloprotease, confirms the feasibility of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, during the course of these experiments, we observed that MT2-MMP decreases the levels of MT1-MMP and betaglycan.

TGF-β controls many physiological processes, and disturbances in its regulation or signaling can lead to disease (3Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar, 4Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals into the cell through two cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors, the TGF-β type I and type II receptors. Signaling is initiated when TGF-β promotes the association of type I and type II receptors. Receptor I is then phosphorylated and activated by the constitutively active kinase of receptor II. The activated receptor I kinase then phosphorylates certain members of the Smads, a novel family of transcriptional regulatory proteins which transduce the TGF-β signal to the nucleus (5Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar, 6Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). TGF-β has two coreceptors, betaglycan and endoglin, which regulate TGF-β access to its signaling receptors. Betaglycan and endoglin are transmembrane glycoproteins with large extracellular regions that bind TGF-β and very similar cytoplasmic regions without any identifiable signaling motif (7López-Casillas F. Cheifetz S. Doody J. Andres J.L. Lane W.S. Massague J. Cell. 1991; 67: 785-795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 8Wang X.F. Lin H.Y. Ng-Eaton E. Downward J. Lodish H.F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 19027-19030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Betaglycan, also known as type III receptor, is a membrane proteoglycan whose glycosaminoglycan chains consist of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. In general, membrane betaglycan is considered a positive regulator of TGF-β because it increases the affinity of the binding of TGF-β to receptor II, enhancing cell responsiveness to TGF-β (10López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 11Sankar S. Mahooti-Brooks N. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13567-13572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This effect is particularly significant for TGF-β2, the isoform for which betaglycan has higher affinity, and appears to be mediated by a “presentation complex” formed by betaglycan, TGF-β and the type II receptor (10López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Betaglycan also regulates the actions of activins, inhibins, and BMPs, other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Specifically, upon binding of inhibin A, betaglycan can associate with the type II receptors for activin or BMP. Because of their presence in such nonsignaling complexes, the availability of these type II receptors is reduced, becoming limited to associating with their corresponding type I receptors and thereby preventing activin or BMP actions (12Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 13Wiater E. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7934-7941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, betaglycan can establish diverse ligand-dependent interactions with type II receptors for at least three members of the TGF-β superfamily. On the one hand, the complex formed with TGF-β and its type II receptor enhances TGF-β actions. Importantly, this latter function explains key features of the betaglycan-null mice phenotype (14Stenvers K.L. Tursky M.L. Harder K.W. Kountouri N. Amatayakul-Chantler S. Grail D. Small C. Weinberg R.A. Sizeland A.M. Zhu H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4371-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). On the other hand, those formed with inhibin A and the corresponding type II receptors antagonize the effects of activin or BMP. As a matter of fact, up to date, betaglycan stands as the only identified inhibin A receptor capable of mediating its characteristic activin antagonism (15Chapman S.C. Bernard D.J. Jelen J. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 196: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Gray P.C. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 188: 254-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the glycosaminoglycan chains are not required for all of these functions (10López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 17Esparza-López J. Montiel J.L. Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Okadome T. Miyazono K. López-Casillas F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14588-14596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), they may modulate them. It has been reported that in some cell lines the nature of the glycosaminoglycan attached to membrane betaglycan core protein may sterically prevent its association with the TGF-β type II receptor, turning it into an inhibitor of TGF-β (18Eickelberg O. Centrella M. Reiss M. Kashgarian M. Wells R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Beta-glycan is also required for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cardiac endothelial cells which leads to heart valve formation. For this reason, in addition of being a TGF-β coreceptor, a more direct function of betaglycan in TGF-β signaling has been proposed (19Brown C.B. Boyer A.S. Runyan R.B. Barnett J.V. Science. 1999; 283: 2080-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A natural soluble form of betaglycan can be found in serum, extracellular matrices, and the conditioned medium of several cell lines (20Andres J.L. Stanley K. Cheifetz S. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3137-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In contrast to membrane betaglycan, soluble betaglycan inhibits TGF-β binding to cell surface receptors in vitro (21López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Montiel J.L. Mendoza V. Mendoza-Hernandez G. López-Casillas F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, betaglycan could be a dual modulator of TGF-β activities: as a membrane protein it is an enhancer of TGF-β actions, and as a soluble protein it is an inhibitor (21López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 22Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Montiel J.L. Mendoza V. Mendoza-Hernandez G. López-Casillas F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This latter property has been exploited therapeutically to block TGF-β actions in a carcinogenesis animal model using a recombinant soluble betaglycan (23Bandyopadhyay A. López-Casillas F. Malik S.N. Montiel J.L. Mendoza V. Yang J. Sun L.Z. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4690-4695PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have proposed that the natural soluble form of betaglycan is generated by a proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound form (10López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1435-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 20Andres J.L. Stanley K. Cheifetz S. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3137-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 21López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, despite its functional importance, the proteolytic cleavage of betaglycan has been poorly characterized. The proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain is not particular for betaglycan; many transmembrane proteins undergo a similar process, frequently referred to as “ectodomain shedding.” The shedding of a large number of membrane proteins is a regulated process that can be enhanced by PMA, a phorbol ester activator of protein kinase C and other signal transduction pathways, and is mediated by zinc metalloproteases (for reviews, see Refs. 24Arribas J. Borroto A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4627-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM 17, also known as TACE (Tumor necrosis factor α-Converting Enzyme), has been implicated in the vast majority of protein kinase C-activated shedding events analyzed to date (27Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

Black R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14608-14614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). In a previous report we showed that, in contrast to the majority of proteins, the shedding of betaglycan is not stimulated by PMA and remains unaffected in a mutant cell line defective in the shedding of a wide variety of proteins (30Arribas J. López-Casillas F. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the shedding of betaglycan in different cell lines, and unexpectedly, we found a novel form of the soluble receptor. The shedding of betaglycan can be stimulated by pervanadate and is mediated by a metalloprotease that is inhibited by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1. Transfection experiments indicate that MT1-MMP and/or MT3-MMP, or a similar metalloprotease, is responsible for the shedding of betaglycan. Materials—Sodium orthovanadate, hydrogen peroxide, PMA, bovine serum albumin, molecular biochemicals, buffers, salts, detergents, and protease inhibitors were from Sigma. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Recombinant human TIMP-1 and recombinant human TIMP-2 were purchased from Fuji Chemical Industries Ltd. (Takaoka, Japan). TAPI-2 was kindly provided by Immunex (Seattle, WA) and BB-94 by British Biotech Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Oxford, UK). Pervanadate was freshly prepared prior to each experiment by mixing 1 m sodium vanadate and 1 m hydrogen peroxide. The polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain 822 and the cytoplasmic domain 821 of betaglycan have been described previously (10López-Casillas F. Wrana J.L. Massague J.

This gag– betaglycan construct is a double point betaglycan mutant of the serines that are the glycosaminoglycan chains acceptor amino acids (S535A/S546A) and expresses betaglycan only as core protein, greatly simplifying the analysis of the betaglycan shedding products. Wild type CHO cells and M1 mutant CHO cells defective in pro-HA/TGF-α shedding have been described elsewhere (32Arribas J. Massague J. J.

Wild type CHO cells and M1 mutant cells were stably transfected with HABG construction subcloned in the pCEP4 vector using the calcium phosphate precipitate method (33Kingston R.E. Chen C.A. Okayama H. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar). The HAgag– and HAgag–FLAG were constructed from the wild type rat betaglycan cDNA tagged at the amino terminus with the HA epitope. Both constructions were created replacing in the wild type betaglycan cDNA a fragment of a previously described gag– mutant in the XhoI and BglII sites (21López-Casillas F. Payne H.M. Andres J.L.

The FLAG epitope was inserted at the carboxyl terminus for the HAgag–FLAG and for the HABGFLAG constructions by PCR. All DNA manipulations were verified by nucleotide sequencing using standard techniques (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

For transient expression in COS-1 and CHO cells the HAgag– and the HAgag–FLAG constructions were subcloned in the pCMV5 vector (35Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Transient COS-1 transfection was done with the diethylaminoethyl-dextran method (40Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Cells were assayed at 48 h post-transfection. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using TriZol (Invitrogen), and 10 μg from each cell line was electrophoresed in 0.9% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA probes used were hamster MT1-MMP, corresponding to a 2,669-bp XbaI/HindIII fragment of the plasmid pcD MycMT1 (36Urena J.M. Merlos-Suarez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); human MT2-MMP, comprising a 1,996-bp EcoRI/PstI fragment from the plasmid pSG MT2-MMP; and human MT3-MMP, of a 1,330-bp EcoRI fragment from the plasmid pSG MT3-MMP. The cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was from rat. Labeling of cDNA probes was done using the Random Primer Labeling Kit (Roche Applied Science) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Hybridization was performed overnight at 65 °C in 0.5 m phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 10 mm EDTA. Bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 7 × 105 L6E9 cells stably expressing Mycgag– were incubated for different periods of time in the absence or presence of 100 μm pervanadate in medium supplemented with 0.2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Medium or cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-betaglycan ectodomain antibody 822. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose. Western Blotting—For Western blotting, immune complexes or aliquots from medium or cell lysates were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed using 1/2000 of the anti-betaglycan ectodomain 822, anti-c-Myc, or anti-HA. Anti-MT1-MMP LEM 2/63 was used directly. Anti-MT2-MMP was used at 1/200 for transfected MT2-MMP and at 10 μg/ml for endogenous MT2-MMP. Anti-MT3-MMP was used at 10 μg/ml. Immunoblots were revealed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography. Only where indicated was the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences) used. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Approximately 7 × 105 cells were labeled for 2 h with 250 μCi/ml 35S-Pro Mix (Amersham Biosciences) in DMEM without l-methionine and l-cysteine (Sigma). The label was chased for 2 h in DMEM containing with 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium). Then the cells were incubated in the presence of different compounds, as indicated, for 30 min in DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum. The medium was collected and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 2 min to remove debris. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates and medium were immunoprecipitated with different antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose (for antibodies 822 and 821) or protein G-Sepharose (for anti-c-Myc and anti-HA antibodies), washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, separated in SDS-PAGE, and bands visualized using a PhosphorImager. Densitometric analysis was carried out using Image-Quant software. Affinity Labeling and Competition Experiments—TGF-β2 was radiolabeled with 125I using chloramine T (41Cheifetz S. Hernandez H. Laiho M. ten Dijke P. Iwata K.K. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20533-20538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Baculoviral recombinant soluble betaglycan was purified as described before (22Vilchis-Landeros M.M. Montiel J.L. Mendoza V. Mendoza-Hernandez G. López-Casillas F. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Amounts of soluble betaglycan sBG-90 were determined by Western blot. Briefly, medium from pervanadate-treated L6E9 cells stably expressing Myc-gag– was concentrated in an Amicon Ultrafiltration chamber (Millipore) and dialyzed against PBS. Aliquots from medium were separated in SDS-PAGE, subjected to Western blotting, and sBG-90 was quantified comparing with different amounts of recombinant soluble betaglycan as standards (data not shown). For competition experiments, recombinant soluble betaglycan and medium with sBG-90 (10 ng/assay) were affinity labeled with 100 pm125I-TGF-β2 in the presence of different concentration of unlabeled TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 for 3 h in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100. Cross-linking was done by the addition of 0.1 mg/ml disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce). Labeling reactions were quenched after 15 min with Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, at a final concentration of 10 mm. The reaction mixture was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by a PhosphorImager. Pervanadate Activates the Shedding of Betaglycan—Ectodomain shedding is frequently a regulated process. However, the shedding of betaglycan is insensitive to phorbol esters, calcium ionophores, or serum factors, three agents that activate the shedding of most proteins analyzed to date (30Arribas J. López-Casillas F. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Arribas J. Massague J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the shedding of the tyrosine kinase receptor HER-2, which is also insensitive to these treatments, can be activated by pervanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (43Codony-Servat J. Albanell J. López-Talavera J.C. Arribas J. Baselga J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1196-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effect of pervanadate on the shedding of the betaglycan. Because of the presence of glycosaminoglycan chains, wild type betaglycan migrates in SDS-PAGE as a broad band of 180–250 kDa, making it difficult to analyze the soluble products of the shedding reaction. Thus, to facilitate this assay, we stably transfected L6E9 myoblasts with a c-Myc-tagged rat membrane betaglycan devoid of glycosaminoglycan chains (L6E9/Mycgag– cells) (Fig. 1A). A short treatment of L6E9/Mycgag– cells with pervanadate induces the liberation of a 90-kDa fragment, which is immunoprecipitated by the polyclonal antibody 822 (directed against the betaglycan extracellular region) and by the monoclonal antibody directed against the c-Myc epitope engineered at the amino terminus (Fig. 1B). As expected, this soluble 90-kDa product (hereafter referred to as sBG-90) is not immunoprecipitated by the polyclonal antibody 821 directed against the cytoplasmic tail of betaglycan (Fig. 1B). The size of sBG-90 differs from the one reported previously (110–120 kDa) for the soluble betaglycan species produced spontaneously by 3T3-L1 cells (20Andres J.L. Stanley K. Cheifetz S. Massague J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3137-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To determine whether L6E9/Myc gag– cells also secrete the 110–120-kDa form, we analyzed the basal shedding of betaglycan in these cells. Fig. 1C shows that in the absence of any treatment, a 120-kDa betaglycan fragment (hereafter referred to as sBG-120) is slowly shed to the medium, being barely visible at 7 h but clearly detectable by 24 h. This slow process very much resembles the “constitutive” shedding that has been invoked to explain the existence of the naturally occurring forms of soluble betaglycan (30Arribas J. López-Casillas F. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17160-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Fig. 1C shows that sBG-90 is also generated by this constitutive mechanism. Thus, these data suggest that, at least two cleavages at different sites of its ectodomain may generate two different soluble forms of the receptor, sBG-120 and the shorter sBG-90 form. The effect of pervanadate on the shedding of sBG-90 is specific because vanadate or H2O2 was without effect (Fig. 1D). Thus, these data indicate that the production of sBG-90 may be regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphoryla"

By confining two different ions on the same magnetron orbit in a Penning trap, we balance out many sources of noise and error (such as fluctuations of the magnetic field). To minimize the systematic error associated with the Coulomb interaction between the two ions, they are kept about 1 millimeter apart from each other, resulting in fractional uncertainty below 1 x 10(-11). Such precision opens the door to numerous applications of mass spectrometry, including metrology, fundamental physics, and weighing chemical bonds."

The annexins are a family of more than 160 unique annexin proteins that are present in more than 65 different species ranging from fungi and protists to plants and higher vertebrates (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). ANXA2 1The abbreviations used are: ANXA2, annexin A2; ATD, aminoterminal domain; CCD, carboxyl core domain; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; RT, reverse transcriptase; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′-bis(phosphate); TBS, Tris-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: ANXA2, annexin A2; ATD, aminoterminal domain; CCD, carboxyl core domain; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein; RT, reverse transcriptase; pCp, cytidine 3′,5′-bis(phosphate); TBS, Tris-buffered saline. consists of an amino-terminal domain (ATD), which comprises the first 30 amino acid residues of the protein and the carboxyl core domain (CCD) composed of the remaining residues. The CCD of ANXA2 contains sites for binding Ca2+, phospholipid, F-actin and heparin (2Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. Annexins: Biological Importance and Annexin-related Pathologies. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003: 127-156Crossref Google Scholar, 3Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The ATD contains regulatory phosphorylation sites for both protein kinase C (Ser-25) and Src (Tyr-23). In fact, the first substrate discovered for Src was identified as a 36-kDa protein (ANXA2) that was phosphorylated upon transformation of cells with the Rous sarcoma virus (4Radke K. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was demonstrated that only about 10% of total cellular ANXA2 was phosphorylated in cells transformed by RSV (4Radke K. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 5Erikson E. Erikson R.L. Cell. 1980; 21: 829-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). ANXA2 exists as three major species: a monomer, a heterodimer, or a heterotetramer (AIIt) (3Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1995; 149: 301-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The heterodimer is composed of a single subunit of ANXA2 bound to a subunit of 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (6Jindal H.K. Chaney W.G. Anderson C.W. Davis R.G. Vishwanatha J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5169-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heterotetramer, on the other hand, comprises two subunits of ANXA2 linked together by a dimer of S100A10 (also referred to as p11), a member of the S100 family of Ca2+-binding proteins (7Erikson E. Tomasiewicz H.G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Gerke V. Weber K.

The relative amounts of heterotetrameric versus monomeric ANXA2 are variable depending on the cell or tissue examined and range from 100% heterotetrameric ANXA2 in intestinal epithelium to about 50% monomeric ANXA2 monomer in cultured fibroblasts (8Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 11Zokas L. Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2111-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). ANXA2 consists of two functional domains. The aminoterminal regulatory domain (ATD) contains the amino-terminal 30 amino acid residues and incorporates two phosphorylation sites at Tyr-23 and Ser-25. In addition to the phosphorylation sites, the ATD also contains the site for interaction with the S100A10 dimer. The remaining CCD, encompassing residues 31–338, comprises the binding sites for Ca2+, phospholipid, heparin, and F-actin (reviewed by Refs. 1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 2Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. Annexins: Biological Importance and Annexin-related Pathologies.

The crystal structure of an amino-terminally truncated form of ANXA2 has been reported (12Burger A. Berendes R. Liemann S. Benz J. Hofmann A. Göttig P. Huber R. Gerke V. Thiel C. Römisch J. Weber K. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The protein is planar and curved with opposing convex and concave sides. The convex side faces the biological membrane and contains the Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding sites. The concave side faces the cytosol and contains both the amino and carboxyl termini. A multitude of intracellular functions have been suggested for ANXA2, including roles as a mediator of Ca2+-regulated exocytosis (13Sarafian T. Pradel L.A. Henry J.P. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J.

Nature. 2002; 417: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since an ANXA2 knockout mouse has not been developed, it is not clear whether these reported in vitro functions represent actual physiological functions of the protein. Nevertheless, knowledge of these putative functions of ANXA2 has not provided clues as to the role that ANXA2 may play in vivo. The expression of ANXA2 is induced in various transformed cells, including v-src-, v-H-ras-, v-mos-, or SV40-transformed cells (23Ozaki T. Sakiyama S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1707-1710PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ANXA2 gene is growth-regulated, and its expression is stimulated by growth factors such as insulin, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (24Keutzer J.C. Hirschhorn R.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Up-regulated ANXA2 has also been reported in human hepatocellular carcinoma (25Frohlich M. Motte P. Galvin K. Takahashi H. Wands J. Ozturk M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3216-3223Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (26Vishwanatha J.K. Chiang Y. Kumble K.D. Hollingsworth M.A. Pour P.M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2575-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), high grade glioma (27Reeves S.A. Chavez Kappel C. Davis R. Rosenblum M. Israel M.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6871-6876PubMed Google Scholar), gastric carcinoma (28Emoto K. Sawada H. Yamada Y. Fujimoto H. Takahama Y. Ueno M. Takayama T. Uchida H. Kamada K. Naito A. Hirao S. Nakajima Y. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 1339-1345PubMed Google Scholar), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (29Menell J.S. Cesarman G.M. Jacovina A.T. McLaughlin M.A. Lev E.A. Hajjar K.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 994-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of the ANXA2 gene is commonly observed in both virally transformed cell lines and human tumors, it has been suspected that this up-regulated level of ANXA2 might link ANXA2 to a key step in cellular transformation. However, without a detailed knowledge of its intracellular role, it is difficult to envision the role that up-regulation of ANXA2 expression would have on cellular transformation. Typically, ANXA2 has been reported to display two distinct intracellular distributions, with the majority of the protein localized to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and a secondary diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (30Courtneidge S. Ralston R. Alitalo K. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The first indication that ANXA2 might interact with RNA was a report that utilized subcellular fractionation to show that a significant portion of ANXA2 was associated with ribonucleoprotein particles in cytoplasmic extracts of both normal and transformed cells. It was also shown that ANXA2 immunoprecipitated from UV-irradiated cultured cells associated with RNA and formed a RNA-ANXA2 cross-linked ribonucleoprotein complex. These authors also showed by biochemical fractionation experiments that about 10–15% of the total cellular ANXA2 was associated with the nucleus (31Arrigo A.P. Darlix J.L. Spahr P.F. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ensuing studies showed that ANXA2 could bind to deoxyribonucleic acid structures such as Z-DNA (32Krishna P. Kennedy B.P. Waisman D.M. van de S e J.H. McGhee J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or Alu subsequences (33Boyko V. Mudrak O. Svetlova M. Negishi Y. Ariga H. Tomilin N. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other studies have identified nuclear ANXA2 in immunoblots of nuclei and as part of a primer recognition complex that stimulates DNA polymerase α activity (6Jindal H.K. Chaney W.G. Anderson C.W. Davis R.G. Vishwanatha J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5169-5176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Vishwanatha J.K. Jindal H.K. Davis R.G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 25-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ANXA2 was also shown to localize with cytoskeleton-associated mRNA subpopulations (35Vedeler A. Hollas H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was shown that ANXA2 possessed a nuclear export sequence, and it was proposed that ANXA2 readily enters the nucleus but is rapidly exported (36Eberhard D.A. Karns L.R. VandenBerg S.R. Creutz C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3155-3166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, we have examined HeLa cell extracts for the presence of ANXA2-binding proteins. Surprisingly, we found that several RNA-associated proteins bound to an ANXA2 affinity column, and this association was blocked by pretreatment with RNase A. We also show that in the presence of Ca2+, ANXA2 binds to ribonucleic homopolymers with a high affinity for poly(G) and in a salt-resistant manner. Subsequently, we show that ANXA2 is an RNA-binding protein that forms a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle. We identify c-myc RNA as a component of the ANXA2-ribonucleoprotein complex and show that ANXA2 binds directly to c-myc mRNA. Last, the expression of ANXA2 in a cell line normally devoid of this protein results in an increase in both ANXA2 and c-Myc protein. Overall, these studies identify ANXA2 as a novel RNA-binding protein that may regulate the translation of c-myc RNA. Cell Lines, DNA Vectors, and Cell Lysis—HeLa, LNCaP, and 293 HEK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic (Invitrogen). The cDNA for ANXA2 and S100A10 were PCR-amplified and ligated into pcDNA3.1/neomycin (pcDNA-S100A10) or pcDNA 3.1/Hygro (pcDNA-ANXA2) (Invitrogen). The c-myc vector (pBluescript) was a generous gift from Dr. Robert Orlowski (Chapel Hill, NC). LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was used as outlined in the manufacturer’s instructions to transfect 10-cm2 dishes of the human prostrate carcinoma cell line, LNCaP, with the pcDNA 3.1 vectors, pcDNA-S100A10 and pcDNA-ANXA2. Stably transfected cells were selected with 7.5 μg/ml neomycin and 5 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Clonal cell lines were selected by ANXA2 and S100A10 protein expression. For detergent based lysis, cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors and clarified by centrifugation at 12, 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Where indicated, cells were hypotonically lysed by resuspending cells (from one 10-cm2 dish) in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 25 mm NaCl plus protease inhibitors) and drawing the solution through a 27-gauge needle five times, followed by 25 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. After incubating on ice for 10 min, a postnuclear supernatant was obtained by clarifying the cell lysate for 10 min at 8,000 × g. Soluble protein fractions were quantitated by BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—HeLa cell lysate (500 μg in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer) was precleared with 1 μg of either nonimmune mouse or rabbit IgG and 20 μl of protein G-PLUS beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C. ANXA2 (a kind gift from Tony Hunter, La Jolla, CA) or ANXA5 (FL-319; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody (1 μg) were then added to the precleared lysate, and the reactions were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of Protein G-PLUS beads (20 μl/reaction) for an additional 1 h. The immune complexes were washed three times and either boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis or extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (PCI 25:24:1) for RNA isolation. For Western blot analysis, proteins in sample buffer were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes, immunostained, and visualized using SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) were obtained from the following sources: Becton Dickinson/Transduction Laboratories (annexin A2 and S100A10), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (annexin A5 (FL-319)), and Cell Signaling Technology (S6 ribosomal protein). Immune Complex RNA Extraction, RNA Labeling, and RT-PCR— The ANXA2 or ANXA5 immune complexes were washed three times with RNase-free Nonidet P-40 buffer and diluted to a final volume of 200 μl with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. The beads were extracted with one volume of PCI and treated with 2 units of DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. The DNase-treated RNA was then extracted with one volume of PCI, followed by ethanol precipitation using linear polyacrylamide (Sigma) as a nucleic acid carrier. The precipitated RNA was diluted to 20 μl with diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and stored at –80 °C. The bound RNA was labeled using RNA ligase and cytidine 3′,5′-bis(phosphate) (pCp; 5′-32P-labeled; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (37Keith G. Biochimie (Paris). 1983; 65: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 μl of the extracted RNA was mixed with 40 units of RNasin, 2 μl of Me2SO, 50 μCi of pCp, and 2 μl of RNA ligase in a final volume of 20 μl and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by PCI extraction and ethanol precipitation as described above. Incorporation of the pCp label was assessed quantitatively by scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid precipitates. Qualitative analysis of incorporation was assessed by electrophoresis of 2 μl of labeled RNA on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. The gel was dried under vacuum, and the labeled RNA was visualized by autoradiography. RT-PCR analysis of the bound RNA was carried out using the One-Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). To detect the 275-nucleotide segment at the 3′-end of the c-myc mRNA as described previously (38Chu E. Takechi T. Jones K.L. Voeller D.M. Copur S.M. Maley G.F. Maley F. Segal S. Allegra C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the following primers were used: forward, 5′-GGCGAACACACAACGTCTTGGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTCAGGACATTTCTGTTAGAAG-3′. Sucrose Gradient Analysis of Cell Lysates—Linear sucrose gradient was performed essentially as described (39Zalfa F. Giorgi M. Primerano B. Moro A. Di Penta A. Reis S. Oostra B. Bagni C. Cell. 2003; 112: 317-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatants from hypotonically lysed cells were sedimented in a 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradient (sucrose solutions made in hypotonic lysis buffer adjusted to 100 mm NaCl) by centrifugation for 2 h at 37,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor. After centrifugation, samples were fractionated into 1-ml fractions by top displacement using a gradient fractionator (Buchler). For Western blot analysis, 20 μl of each gradient fraction was boiled for 5 min with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed as described previously. Homoribopolymer Binding Assay—Binding of cell lysates to homoribopolymers was carried out essentially as described previously with a few modifications (40Brown V. Small K. Lakkis L. Feng Y. Gunter C. Wilkinson K.D. Warren S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cell lysate (100 μg in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer) was incubated with a 25-μl packed volume of homoribopolymer beads (Sigma) and rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, boiled in 25 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and probed for ANXA2 by Western blot as described above. For purified ANXA2 binding to homoribopolymer beads, 1 μg of ANXA2 was added to 25 μl of packed homoribopolymer beads in 0.5 ml of TBS. Protein binding analysis was carried out as described above either by Western blot or by staining with Coomassie Blue where indicated. Annexin-conjugated Affinity Matrices—Purified ANXA2 and ANXA5 (10 mg each at 1 mg/ml) were coupled to 5-ml aliquots of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B matrix according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). An unconjugated, control matrix was produced by incubating 5 ml of swollen gel with 10 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. For the isolation of ANXA2 and ANXA5 protein binding partners, 10 mg of Nonidet P-40-soluble cell lysate (2 mg/ml) was first rotated with 2 ml of the Tris-blocked matrix in the presence of either 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA for 2 h at 4 °C. This precleared lysate (5 mg) was then rotated with 1 ml of either the ANXA2 or ANXA5 affinity matrix for 2 h at 4 °C. The matrices were washed three times with 10 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer, and the bound proteins were boiled for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.5 ml for blocked matrix, 0.25 ml for annexin matrices). Aliquots of the eluted proteins (200 μl/lane) were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. To assess the contribution of either cellular RNA or DNA in binding of the proteins to the ANXA2 affinity matrix, the cell lysates were preincubated at 37 °C with either 200 units/ml RNasin (Promega), 50 units/ml DNase I (Ambion), or 500 μg/ml RNase A (Qiagen) for 30 min. After the incubation, the cell lysates were rotated in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 with the Tris-blocked matrix followed by incubation with the ANXA2 affinity column. Bound proteins were analyzed as described above. Protein Identification by In-gel Tryptic Digestion and Mass Spectrometry—Stained bands were excised, and an automated in-gel tryptic digestion was performed on a Mass Prep Station (Micromass, UK). The gel pieces were destained, reduced (dithiothreitol), alkylated (iodo-acetamide), and digested with trypsin (Promega sequencing grade modified), and the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel and analyzed via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed on a CapLC (Waters) high pressure liquid chromatograph and a Q-ToF-2 (Micromass) Mass Spectrometer, using a Picofrit C18 reversed-phase capillary column (New Objectives). Proteins were identified from the mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry data using MASCOT (Matrix Science, UK) and searching the NCBI data base. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ANXA2—The galactose-inducible Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression vector (pYeDP60) as well as the vector containing the cDNA for ANXA2 (pYeDP60-ANXA2) were kindly supplied by Jesus Ayala-Sanmartin (INSERM, Paris, France) and have been described previously (41Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cDNA of the S100A10 protein was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pYeDP60 vector, followed by the transformation of the vectors into the protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain FKY282 (kindly supplied by Francois Kepes, Genopole, Envy, France). The growth and induction of the yeast cultures was done as described previously (41Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), with only slight modifications. Prior to purification, 1-liter cultures of annexin II- and S100A10-expressing yeast were mixed, resulting in the isolation of 1-mg quantities each of ANXA2 and ANXA2 heterotetramer using the purification detailed previously. The isolated proteins were purified further using gel permeation chromatography equilibrated in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C. Ultraviolet Cross-linking Assay—Full-length (1.8 kb) c-myc message was transcribed and labeled in vitro with T7 polymerase (Stratagene) with [32P]UTP. 32P-Labeled RNA probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription with the RiboProbe® system (Promega). 32P-Labeled c-myc mRNA (1.77 × 108 cpm/μg) was incubated with 1.5 μg of purified recombinant AIIt with or without unlabeled c-myc RNA, positive control template RNA, and homoribopolymers (poly(G) and poly(C)). The RNA-protein mixture binding reaction was carried out in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5% glycerol, and 2 μg of yeast tRNA. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, after which they were irradiated with UV on ice for 12 bursts of 30 s with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). RNAs were digested with 1 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 15 min and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Surface Plasmon Resonance—ANXA2 heterotetramer was coupled to a CM5 sensor chip in a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) using the manufacturer’s amine-coupling kit. Homoribopolymer-binding assays were conducted in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2 at 25 °C and a flow rate of 30 μl/min. A nonderivitized flow cell was used as a control for the contribution of the bulk refractive index to the surface plasmon resonance signal. After each injection, the surface was regenerated with an injection of 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl. An approximate equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was obtained by measuring the equilibrium resonance units (Req) at several poly(G) concentrations (10 nm to 1 μm) at equilibrium. Binding data were analyzed by Scatchard analysis using the BIAevaluation software according to the following relationship: Req/C = KaRmax – KaReq, where Rmax is the resonance signal at saturation, C is the concentration of free analyte, and Ka is the equilibrium association constant. ANXA2 Forms a Ribonucleoprotein Complex—As a first step in elucidation of the possible physiological function(s) of ANXA2, we attempted to isolate intracellular proteins that interacted with ANXA2. In order to isolate these binding partners, we utilized CNBr-activated Sepharose matrices conjugated with ANXA2 or a blocked, unconconjugated resin (resin control). Annexin A5 (ANXA5), which has considerable sequence and structural similarity to ANXA2, was also conjugated to the matrix as a specificity control. Cell lysates prepared from either HeLa or 293 HEK cells were first precleared with unconjugated Sepharose matrix, followed by application to either the ANXA2 or ANXA5 matrices. These cell types were chosen because of their differing levels of endogenous ANXA2; HeLa cells have an abundance of endogenous ANXA2, whereas 293 HEK cells have substantially less ANXA2 by comparison (data not shown). Since the annexins are known to require Ca2+ to bind to cellular targets, the cell lysates were incubated with the affinity matrix in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Upon completion of the binding reactions, the proteins bound to the matrices were removed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by separation on 8% polyacrylamide gels. We observed that several cellular proteins associated with the ANXA2 matrix (Fig. 1A, lane 3). These cellular proteins did not associate with the control matrix or the ANXA5 affinity matrix, and the association of these proteins with the ANXA2 matrix required Ca2+. It is interesting to note that nearly identical results were obtained using 293 HEK cell lysate as starting material (data not shown). This suggests that the bound material does not require high levels of ANXA2 expression; nor does it appear to bind to ANXA2 stoichiometrically. Having established that ANXA2 binds to a number of distinct cellular proteins in a specific and Ca2+-dependent manner, the bands were excised and digested, and the fragments were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A portion of the mass spectrometry results is shown in Table I. Surprisingly, we noticed that many of the proteins identified as specific ANXA2-binding proteins were either ribosomal proteins or proteins that are known to interact with cellular RNA. For example, the major proteins that bound to the ANXA2 affinity column included poly(A)-binding protein-1 (42Wang M.Y. Cutler M. Karimpour I. Kleene K.C.

Although the pathogenesis has not been clarified, mitochondrial complex I is suppressed, and caspase-3 is activated in the affected midbrain. Here we report that a combination of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) or rotenone and proteasome inhibition causes the appearance of α-synuclein-positive inclusion bodies. Unexpectedly, however, proteasome inhibition blocked MPP+- or rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuronal death. MPP+ elevated proteasome activity, dephosphorylated mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK), and activated caspase-3. Proteasome inhibition reversed the MAPK dephosphorylation and blocked caspase-3 activation; the neuroprotection was blocked by a p42 and p44 MAPK kinase inhibitor. Thus, the proteasome plays an important role in both inclusion body formation and dopaminergic neuronal death but these processes form opposite sides on the proteasome regulation in this model.

However, the relationship between dopaminergic neuronal death and inclusion body formation has not been elucidated. Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding Parkin (1Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin ligase E3 of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (2Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L.

Furthermore, in patients with sporadic PD, proteasome activity is well preserved in the striatum (4Furukawa Y. Vigouroux S. Wong H. Guttman M. Rajput A.H. Ang L. Briand M. Kish S.J. Briand Y. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 779-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but reduced in the midbrain (5McNaught K.S. Jenner P. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been assumed that insufficient function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD including ARJP. α-Synuclein, mutation of which causes familial PD (6Polymeropoulos M.H.

Therefore, impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is thought to be associated with inclusion body formation. The substrates of ubiquitin ligase E3 Parkin are thought to be accumulated in dopaminergic neurons in ARJP; however, Lewy bodies have not been detected in patients with ARJP (13Mori H. Kondo T.

Neurol. 2001; 50: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of Lewy bodies dopaminergic neuronal degeneration starts earlier in patients with ARJP than in those with sporadic PD. In this context, inclusion body formation is not always required for dopaminergic neuronal death, and the role of Lewy body formation in the pathogenesis of PD has not been fully elucidated. Although the pathogenesis of sporadic cases has not been clarified, mitochondrial complex I is suppressed in sporadic PD patients (16Hattori N. Tanaka M. Ozawa T. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1991; 30: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Schapira A.H. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Clark J.B. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J.

Suppl. 1997; 50: 89-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which suppress mitochondrial complex I activity, may be involved. MPTP is unique in causing chronic progressive dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the human brain. It is converted to MPP+ by monoamine oxidase and is taken up into dopaminergic neurons through the dopamine transporter. It inhibits the activity of mitochondrial complex I and causes selective dopaminergic neuronal death (22Mizuno Y. Sone N. Saitoh T. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1787-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 23Przedborski S. Vila M. Clin. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 1: 407-418Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 24Ramsay R.R. Salach J.I. Singer T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that chronic exposure to rotenone, a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I, causes selective neuronal death of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons with Lewy-like α-synuclein inclusion body formation (25Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar, 26Sherer T.B. Kim J.H. Betarbet R. Greenamyre J.T. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 179: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Here we report that dopaminergic neuronal death induced by mitochondria complex I inhibition using MPP+ or rotenone was accompanied by an elevation in proteasome activity and that proteasome inhibition caused α-synuclein inclusion body formation but blocked dopaminergic neuronal death. Primary Neuronal Culture of the Ventral Mesencephalon—Cultures of the rat mesencephalon were established according to methods described previously (27Sawada H. Ibi M. Kihara T. Urushitani M. Honda K. Nakanishi M. Akaike A. Shimohama S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1202-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ventral two-thirds of the mesencephalon were dissected from rat embryos on the 16th day of gestation. The dissected regions included dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area but not noradrenergic neurons from the locus ceruleus. Neurons were dissociated mechanically and plated out onto 0.1% polyethyleneimine-coated plastic coverslips at a density of 1.1 × 105 cells/cm2. The culture medium consisted of Eagle’s minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for the first 1–4 days in culture and horse serum from the 5th day onwards. The animals were treated in accordance with guidelines published in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Treatment of Cultures—To investigate MPP+-induced neurotoxicity, cultured neurons were exposed to 1–100 μm MPP+ for 24 h or 10 μm MPP+ for 24–72 h on the 7th day of culture and then fixed. To determine the effects of proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin, proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), MG-132) on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity, the cultures were incubated simultaneously with these inhibitors and 10 μm MPP+ for 24 or 48 h on the 7th day of culture. Control experiments were sham operations, similar to the treatment but using minimum essential medium with Earle’s salts containing no drugs. MPP+ was dissolved in water. Rotenone was dissolved in Me2SO. Because incubation with less than 0.1% ethanol for 24 h was found to have no effect on neuronal survival rates, lactacystin, PSI, and MG-132 were dissolved in ethanol. In pilot studies concentrations of lactacystin greater than 10 μm, PSI greater than 100 μm, and MG-132 greater than 1 μm were toxic to cultured neurons. Therefore, the drug concentrations used were 10 nm to 1 μm for lactacystin, 10–100 nm for MG-132, and 0.01–10 μm for PSI. Immunocytochemical Investigation—The numbers of surviving neurons were determined using immunostaining as described in our previous study (28Sawada H. Kawamura T. Shimohama S. Akaike A. Kimura J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation, cultured cells were incubated with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (diluted at 1:1000, PA-152, Chemicon) for 24 h, with the secondary biotinylated antibody for 1 h, and with avidin-biotin complex solution (Vectastain) for 1 h. Finally, the cultures were reacted with diaminobenzidine solution for 6 min. The number of cells stained with anti-TH antibody in the 15 randomly selected fields (×200) was counted as the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons by investigators who were blind to the experimental treatments. Neurotoxicity was evaluated by the reduction in the neuronal survival rate in each experiment. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparison using Newman-Keul’s method. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. To investigate the accumulation of ubiquitin and α-synuclein, cultured cells were incubated with anti-ubiquitin (diluted 1:300, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and anti-α-synuclein (diluted 1:4000, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) antibodies for 24 h. Anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) was used to detect caspase-3 activation. Cultured cells were exposed to 30 μm MPP+ for 18 h and then immunocytochemically stained with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:50) for 24 h. A specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (Ac-DMQD-CHO) was obtained from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Immunocytochemical Analysis by Double Labeling—A double-immunostaining method was used to investigate the co-localization of α-synuclein and TH, a marker of dopaminergic neurons. On the 8th day in culture cells were fixed and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-TH antibody (1:600, MB318, Chemicon International) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse Ig G antibody for 1 h at room temperature, with peroxidase-conjugated avidin-biotin-complex solution (Vectastain) for 1 h and finally with diaminobenzidine solution containing hydrogen peroxide. Cells were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody (overnight incubation at 4 °C, 1:4000) and with biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig G antibody and reacted with avidin-biotinylated alkaline phosphatase complex (Vectastain). Finally, they were visualized using an anti-alkaline phosphatase kit solution (Vectastain) for 15 min. Immunoblotting—Cells were fixed on the ninth day in culture to determine the protein levels of α-synuclein, total and phosphorylated mitogen-activating protein kinase (MAPK) (New England Biolabs Inc.), and Bcl-X (Transduction Laboratories) by Western blotting. Cells were washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline, harvested using a cell scraper, and lysed in buffer containing Tris (40 μm), β-glycerophosphate (50 mm), EGTA (0.8 mm), Triton X-100 (2%), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), aprotinin (1%), dithiothreitol (2 mm), and vanadate (1 mm) on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 150,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein was denatured by boiling at 100 °C for 4 min. An aliquot (10 μg of protein) of the supernatant was loaded onto a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, separated electrophoretically, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated with 10 mm Tris-buffered saline containing 1.0% Tween 20 and 5% dehydrated skim milk (Difco) to block nonspecific protein binding. Then the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (anti-α-synuclein antibody (1:2000), anti-total MAPK antibody (1:1000), anti-phosphorylated MAPK antibody (1: 1000), or anti-Bcl-X antibody (1:2000)) and with secondary antibody. Subsequently, membrane-bound horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL-plus, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Fuji x-ray film. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Release Assay—The release of LDH was measured from culture medium using an LDH assay kit (Kyokuto MTX-LDH assay kit, Tokyo, Japan). The culture medium samples were collected 48 h after the onset of drug exposures and incubated with a substrate solution containing nitro blue tetrazolium, diaphorase, and NAD at 37 °C for 45 min. Then the reaction was terminated with a stop solution (0.5 m HCl). The absorbance measurements at 560 nm were taken as LDH release. LDH contained in the 10% horse serum minimum essential medium with Earle’s salts was subtracted from each experiment. Proteasome Activity Assay—Proteasome activity was quantified by measurement of the release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin from the fluorogenic peptide Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin using an assay kit, 20 S proteasome assay kit (Affinity Research Product, Exeter, UK). Cultured cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, harvested on ice, and resuspended into a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes and 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were centrifuged and lysed by brief sonication, added to the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Proteasome activity was detected by changes in fluorescence intensity at 355 nm of excitation and 460 nm of emission using an automatic multi-well plate reader. The relative activity was standardized by protein concentration, which was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Dose Relationship of Neuroprotection and Proteasome Inhibition by Lactacystin—Rate of neuroprotection was defined as Neuroprotection=[Survival]lacta-[Survival]MPP+[Survival]sham-[Survival]MPP+×100(Eq. 1) where [Survival]lacta is survival after MPP+ exposure with lactacystin, [Survival]MPP+ is survival after MPP+ exposure without lactacystin, and [Survival]sham is survival after sham treatment. The dose-response curve for neuroprotection was fitted to the curve using following the Michaelis-Menten equation, Neuroprotection=Emax×[Lactacystin][Lactacystin]+ED50×100(Eq. 2) where [Lactacystin] is the lactacystin concentration (nm), ED50 is the ED50 of neuroprotection, and Emax is the maximal effect of neuroprotection. The values of ED50 and Emax were determined by the computer software (GraphPad Prism 4.0, GraphPad software Inc.). The rate of proteasome inhibition was defined as the following formula, Proteasomeinhibition=[P.activity]MPP+-[P.activity]lacta[P.activity]MPP+×100(Eq. 3) where [P. activity]lacta is proteasome activity after MPP+ exposure with lactacystin and [P. activity]MPP is proteasome activity after MPP+ exposure without lactacystin. The curve fitting for proteasome inhibition was performed similarly as neuroprotection. Intranigral Microinjection of MPP+ and Proteasome Inhibitors— Male Wistar rats weighing ∼180 g were used. The rats were fasted overnight with free access to water. For stereotaxic microinjection rats were anesthetized (sodium pentobarbital, 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and immobilized in a Kopf stereotaxic frame. Subsequently, the rats were injected with MPP+ (3 μg) and lactacystin (0.12 μg) or MG-132 (0.19 μg) in a final volume of 4 μl of sterilized physiological saline (containing 1% Me2SO) (n = 4). This was injected into the substantia nigra via a motor-driven 10-μl Hamilton syringe. After 7 days treated rats were perfused through the aorta with 150 ml of 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline followed by 300 ml of a cold fixative consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.35% glutaraldehyde, and 0.2% picric acid in 100 mm phosphate buffer under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). After perfusion the brain was quickly removed and post-fixed for 2 days with paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer and then transferred to a 15% sucrose solution in 100 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.1% sodium azide at 4 °C. 20-μm-thick nigral sections were cut in a cryostat and collected into 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After several washes, the nigral slices were incubated with rabbit polyclonal TH antibody (1: 20000, AB-151, Chemicon International) for 3 days at 4 °C. The antibody was detected by an ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) using diaminobenzidine with nickel enhancement. Subsequently, the number of TH-positive neurons in the nigral sections was counted blind to the experiments. Protein Ubiquitination in MPP+-induced Dopaminergic Neuronal Degeneration—Using rat mesencephalic cultured neurons, we investigated dopaminergic neuronal death, protein ubiquitination, and α-synuclein accumulation in MPP+-induced neurotoxicity by immunostaining using anti-TH (a marker for dopaminergic neurons), anti-ubiquitin, and anti-α-synuclein antibodies, respectively. Exposure to MPP+ (1–100 μm) for 24 h caused dopaminergic neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner but did not cause α-synuclein aggregation (data not shown). Long term exposure to 10 μm MPP+ (for 24, 48, and 72 h) caused dopaminergic neuronal death, which increased with exposure time. A 24-h exposure caused fine cytoplasmic depositions of a ubiquitin-positive substance but did not cause α-synuclein aggregation (Fig. 1, A and B). Cytoplasmic depositions of ubiquitin were not detected after MPP+ exposure for 48 h or longer (Fig. 1A). In contrast to ubiquitin depositions, α-synuclein-positive fine granules were seen in the cytosol after 72 h exposure (Fig. 1, A and C). Quantitative analysis revealed transient ubiquitination followed by α-synuclein deposition (Fig. 1D). Double-labeled immunocytochemical analysis using anti-ubiquitin (dark blue) and anti-TH (brown) antibodies revealed cytoplasmic protein ubiquitination in dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 1E). About half of the ubiquitin-positive cells were TH-positive neurons (Fig. 1F). After a 72-h exposure to MPP+, double-labeled immunocytochemical analysis using anti-α-synuclein (dark blue) and anti-TH (brown) antibodies revealed that more than 80% of the α-synuclein-positive neurons were dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 1, G and H). MPP+-induced Dopaminergic Neuronal Death and the Proteasome—MPP+-induced dopaminergic neuronal death was accompanied by cytoplasmic protein ubiquitination, which can be a target of the proteasome. Therefore, we investigated proteasome activity after exposure to MPP+. Although MPP+ did not directly elevate the proteasome activity in a cell-free assay (Supplemental Fig. 1), exposure of cultured mesencephalic cells to MPP+ for 2 h significantly elevated proteasome activity (Fig. 2A). The proteasome activity was significantly elevated at 2–48 h after exposure to MPP+ (Fig. 2B). The elevated proteasome activity was suppressed by 0.1–1.0 μm lactacystin (A. G. Scientific Inc. San Diego, California), a cell-permeable and irreversible inhibitor of both the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes (Fig. 2C). Therefore, 0.1–1.0 μm lactacystin was used to investigate the effect of proteasome inhibition on MPP+-induced neurotoxicity. Simultaneous administration of lactacystin significantly blocked MPP+-induced dopaminergic neuronal death at doses of 0.1–1.0 μm (Fig. 2D). A dose-response curve of neuroprotection by lactacystin was similar to that of proteasome inhibition (Fig. 2E). A reversible proteasome inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG-132, Calbiochem, 100 nm) also suppressed the proteasome activity (Fig. 2F) and provided significant neuroprotection against MPP+-induced toxicity (Fig. 2G). 48 h of exposure to 1.0 μm lactacystin or 100 nm MG-132 alone had no effect on the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons (Supplemental Fig. 2). Immunocytochemical staining revealed that 10 μm MPP+ alone reduced the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons and shortened the neurites and that co-administration with lactacystin or MG-132 blocked the MPP+-induced neurotoxic effect (Fig. 2H). A cell-permeable irreversible proteasome inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(O-t-butyl)-Ala-leucinal (PSI, Carbiochem) significantly blocked proteasome activity (Fig. 2I) and also blocked dopaminergic neuronal death (Fig. 2, J and K). LDH release assay revealed that exposure to 30 μm MPP+ for 48 h elevated LDH release, and the LDH release elevation was blocked by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3). Furthermore, dopaminergic neuronal death by 72 h of exposure to MPP+ was also blocked by lactacystin or MG-132 (Supplemental Fig. 3). The time course of the protective effect of a proteasome inhibitor against MPP+-induced dopaminergic neuronal death was investigated. Lactacystin was administered at 0, 12, 24, and 36 h after the beginning of a 48-h exposure to 10 μm MPP+. Administration at 0 or 12 h after the beginning of MPP+ exposure provided significant neuroprotection, but administration at 24 h or later did not provide any protection (Fig. 4, A and B).Fig. 3LDH release assay demonstrated that exposure to 30 μm MPP+ for 48 h caused significant elevation of LDH release, which was blocked by lactacystin (A), MG-132 (B), or PSI (C). *, p < 0.05 compared with control by one-way ANOVA, n = 4 dishes/experiment; #, p < 0.05 compared with MPP+ alone by one-way ANOVA, n = 4 dishes/experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Temporal profile of the neuroprotective effect of lactacystin against MPP+-induced dopaminergic neuronal death. A and B, immunostaining with an anti-TH antibody revealed that MPP+ (10 μm, 48 h) reduced the number of surviving dopaminergic neurons. Co-administration of 0.1 μm lactacystin at the beginning of MPP+ exposure (Lacta (0–48H)) provided significant neuroprotection. Administration of lactacystin at 12 h after the beginning of MPP+ exposure (Lacta (12–48H)) also provided a neuroprotective effect. In contrast, administration more than 24 h after the beginning of MPP+ exposure (Lacta (24–48H) and Lacta (36–48H)) did not have any neuroprotective effect. *, p < 0.001 compared with control by ANOVA. #, p < 0.001 compared with MPP+ by ANOVA and post-hoc multiple comparison using Newman-Keul’s test. n = 4 coverslips/experiment. NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Proteasome and Dopaminergic Neuronal Death in Vivo —We investigated the effect of proteasome inhibitors on dopaminergic neuronal death in vivo. MPP+ was injected stereotaxically into the unilateral mesencephalon, and the rats were sacrificed 7 days after microinjection to investigate dopaminergic neuronal loss. MPP+ caused dopaminergic neuronal loss in the ipsilateral substantia nigra, and this was blocked by the co-administration of lactacystin or MG-132 with MPP+ (Fig. 5). Inclusion Body Formation in Dopaminergic Neurons after Combined Treatment with MPP+ and Proteasome Inhibitors— The effect of the simultaneous addition of proteasome inhibitors to 24 h of MPP+ treatment was investigated to determine the role of the proteasome system in α-synuclein aggregation. Combination of MPP+ and lactacystin caused the formation of α-synuclein-positive inclusions in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A, α-synuclein). Co-administration of PSI or MG-132 with MPP+ also caused α-synuclein-positive inclusion formation. In contrast to treatment with MPP+ alone, massive round-shaped inclusions (5–8 μm in diameter) were seen in the cytoplasm. We then investigated the localization of the α-synuclein inclusions by double-labeled immunostaining using anti-TH (brown) and anti-α-synuclein (dark blue) antibodies (Fig. 6A, TH/α-synuclein). In the control experiment, TH was stained in the cytoplasm and neurites, and 24 h of MPP+ treatment caused shortening of the neurites. However, α-synuclein was not detected in either experiment. Combined treatment with MPP+ and proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin, PSI, or MG-132) caused α-synuclein inclusion formation (dark blue) in the cytoplasm of dopaminergic neurons (brown). These α-synuclein-positive inclusions were seen in about 3–8 neurons/cm2, corresponding to about 1% of dopaminergic neurons. The inclusion bodies caused by a combination of MPP+ and proteasome inhibitors were stained with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 6A, ubiquitin). Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the inclusions were stained with eosin but not with hematoxylin (data not shown). Treatment with proteasome inhibitors alone did not cause the appearance of α-synuclein inclusions (Fig. 6B). Western blotting analysis revealed that MPP+ treatment with or without lactacystin caused an elevation in the α-synuclein protein level (Fig. 6C). Rotenone-induced Dopaminergic Neuronal Death and the Proteasome—Furthermore, we investigated dopaminergic neuronal death induced by rotenone, a pharmacological inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I in rat mesencephalon primary culture. Rotenone caused dopaminergic neuronal death in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 7, A and B). Exposure to rotenone caused a slight but significant elevation in proteasome activity (Fig. 7, C and D). Although rotenone-induced dopaminergic neuronal death (0.1–10 μm for 24 h or 0.1 μm for 24–72 h) was not accompanied by α-synuclein aggregation (data not shown), at 0.1 μm for 48 h it was significantly blocked by the co-administration of the proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin, or MG-132 (Fig. 7, E and F). Combined treatment with rotenone and either lactacystin or MG-132 caused the appearance of massive round inclusions stained with α-synuclein (Fig. 7E). Neuroprotective Mechanism of Proteasome Inhibition—To elucidate the mechanism of neuroprotection by proteasome inhibitors, we investigated the effects of lactacystin on proteins mediating survival signals. Among them, MAPK (29Ferrer I. Blanco R. Carmona M. Puig B. Barrachina M. Gomez C. Ambrosio S. J. Neural Transm. 2001; 108"
https://openalex.org/W2084680530,"Chromosomal DNA replication requires the recruitment of the six-subunit minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) complex to chromatin through the action of Cdc6 and Cdt1. Although considerable work has described the functions of Cdc6 and Cdt1 in yeast and biochemical systems, evidence that their mammalian counterparts are subject to distinct regulation suggests the need to further explore the molecular relationships involving Cdc6 and Cdt1. Here we demonstrate that Cdc6 and Cdt1 are mutually dependent on one another for loading Mcm complexes onto chromatin in mammalian cells. The association of Cdt1 with Mcm2 is regulated by cell growth. Mcm2 prepared from quiescent cells associates very weakly with Cdt1, whereas Mcm2 from serum-stimulated cells associates with Cdt1 much more efficiently. Cdc6, which normally accumulates as cells progress from quiescence into G1, is capable of inducing the binding of Mcm2 to Cdt1 when ectopically expressed in quiescent cells. We further show that Cdc6 physically associates with Cdt1 via its N-terminal noncatalytic domain, a region we had previously shown to be essential for Cdc6 function. Cdt1 activity is inhibited by the geminin protein, and we provide evidence that the mechanism of this inhibition involves blocking the binding of Cdt1 to both Mcm2 and Cdc6. These results identify novel molecular functions for both Cdc6 and geminin in controlling the association of Cdt1 with other components of the replication apparatus and indicate that the association of Cdt1 with the Mcm complex is controlled as cells exit and reenter the cell cycle.

Eukaryotic chromosomes undergo a highly regulated preparation process during the G1 phase of the cell cycle in order to allow DNA replication and the initiation of S phase. An early step in laying the groundwork for DNA replication is the formation of prereplication complexes at multiple chromosomal origins. Prereplication complexes are generated by the ordered addition of the six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC), 1The abbreviations used are: ORC, origin recognition complex; Mcm, minichromosome maintenance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MOI, multiplicity of infection. the Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins, and the six-subunit minichromosome maintenance complex (Mcm) to the presumptive origin. Individual members of the prereplication complex were initially identified by genetic screens in yeast or by biochemical purification from Xenopus laevis egg extracts, and orthologs of each have been identified in all eukaryotic species examined. Each factor has been shown to be strictly required for DNA replication, and the molecular functions of many of these proteins have been characterized (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ritzi M. Knippers R.

Studies have indicated that the first step in the formation of prereplication complexes is the association of ORC with chromosomal origins of DNA replication. ORC is then required for the subsequent recruitment of Cdc6 and Cdt1, which in turn recruit the Mcm complex to chromatin (9Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G.

Untimely DNA synthesis could have catastrophic effects on cell viability or normal proliferative controls; therefore, prereplication complex assembly is permitted only during G1. The protein components of the prereplication complex are subject to a wide variety of controls, including phosphorylation, relocalization, and regulated protein accumulation through transcription and/or degradation, which restrict their activity to G1 and prevent the assembly of additional prereplication complexes on already replicated DNA. As a result, no part of the genome is replicated more than once per cell cycle (see Refs. 3Diffley J.F. Labib K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 869-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pelizon C.

Studies in yeast and biochemical model systems have provided considerable insight into the function of prereplication complex proteins. However, it is apparent that the regulation of prereplication complex assembly in metazoans differs in important ways from that observed in yeasts or X. laevis egg extracts. For example, the subunits of the Mcm complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as S phase proceeds (17Labib K. Diffley J.F. Kearsey S.E. Nat.

In addition, many of the genes that encode prereplication complex components are subject to transcriptional control in somatic cells, a level of regulation that does not apply to biochemical experimental systems. For these reasons, it is important to investigate the regulation of prereplication complex components in mammalian cells. Both Cdc6 and Cdt1 are required for the association Mcm complexes with chromatin, but it is not clear if they function as partners or if they function independently of one another. Cdc6 is an ATPase, and ATP binding and hydrolysis by Cdc6 is strictly required for DNA replication (37Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Conversely, the primary structure of Cdt1 does not suggest an enzymatic activity, and Cdt1 does not bear strong similarity to other proteins of known function. Cdt1 accumulates during G1 and S phase but is inhibited by association with the geminin protein, which accumulates during S phase and G2. Geminin binds to Cdt1 and inhibits the recruitment of Mcm proteins to chromatin, presumably by interfering with an essential Cdt1 function (13Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat.

We sought to explore the molecular relationships between Cdc6, Cdt1, and the Mcm complex in a mammalian cell setting. In particular, we are interested in the processes by which replication complexes are assembled as cells leave a quiescent state and prepare for reentry into the cell cycle. In that regard, we have examined the protein-protein and protein-chromatin interactions involving Cdc6 and Cdt1 as quiescent cells are induced to grow. In this study, we provide evidence that Cdc6 and Cdt1 each require the function of the other in order to promote Mcm chromatin loading in mammalian cells. Cdc6 binds to Cdt1 via an essential N-terminal noncatalytic domain. Moreover, we find that the association of Cdt1 with Mcm2 (a subunit of the Mcm complex) is regulated by cell growth and that this interaction is influenced by Cdc6 and by geminin. These findings identify novel interactions between Cdt1, Cdc6, and geminin that contribute to the control of prereplication complex formation. Cells and Adenovirus—HeLa and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. REF52 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum plus 5% calf serum and made quiescent by incubating in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum plus 0.1% calf serum for 48 h. Restimulation was achieved by the addition of fetal calf serum to a final concentration of 20%. Cell cycle position was confirmed by staining with propidium iodide and flow cytometry (Cancer Center Flow Cytometry facility, Duke University Medical Center). Cells were infected with purified recombinant adenoviruses as previously described (41Cook J.G. Park C.H. Burke T.W. Leone G. DeGregori J. Engel A. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cdt1 was excised as an EcoRI - NotI fragment from pGEX-Cdt1(gift of A. Dutta), the EcoRI site was made flush by treatment with Klenow, and the fragment was inserted into B-Shuttle-CMV (a derivative of pShuttle-CMV that lacks an irrelevant BamHI site) that had been digested with Asp718, made flush with T4 DNA polymerase, and then digested with NotI. A fragment containing the geminin open reading frame was produced from a cDNA-containing plasmid (gift of T. McGarry) in a PCR with oligonucleotide primers to generate a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ EagI site flanking the open reading frame, digested with BamHI and EagI, and ligated to B-Shuttle-CMV that had been digested with BglII and NotI. The correct sequence of the resulting clone was confirmed. Adenovirus expressing amino acids 1-192 of Cdc6 was constructed by PCR amplification of the first 192 codons of Cdc6 with oligonucleotide primers that encode a BamHI site upstream of the initiator ATG at the 5′ end and a stop codon followed by a NotI site at the 3′ end. The resulting fragment was used to replace the full-length Cdc6 open reading frame in pJGC5, a shuttle vector that encodes five tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope tag at the N terminus of Cdc6 (41Cook J.G.

N-terminal deletions of Cdc6 were constructed by PCR amplification of the 5′ portion of the Cdc6 cDNA in pcDNA3Myc5, and the resulting plasmids were sequenced. A plasmid to express hexahistidine-tagged geminin was constructed by inserting the geminin open reading frame as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment into the corresponding sites of pET28a (Novagen). A plasmid encoding the murine Cdc6 cDNA (pFastBac-mCdc6, a gift of F. Grummt (45Berger C. Strub A. Staib C. Lepke M. Zisimopoulou P. Hoehn K. Nanda I. Schmid M. Grummt F. Cytogenet.

RNAi—A pool of double-stranded RNA specific to human Cdc6 (19-mers beginning with nucleotides 291, 587, 957, and 1278 of HSU77949) was obtained from Dharmacon (catalog no. M-003233-00-05). HeLa cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with RNAi and plasmid at a final RNAi concentration of up to 0.75 μm using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) for 40 h. In Vitro Protein Binding Assays—GST-Cdt1 was produced in BL21(DE3) cells from pGEX-Cdt1 by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. GST was produced from the pGEX-5X-1 empty vector (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were pelleted and frozen at -80 °C. Frozen cells were resuspended in Buffer 6 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KAc, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and 1 mg/ml lysozyme and sonicated three times for 30 s at moderate power 30% duty cycle. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g, clarified supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2-3 h with constant rotation. Bound GST proteins were washed several times with cold Buffer 6 containing inhibitors and distributed to microcentrifuge tubes. REF52 cells (∼8 × 105 cells/sample) were harvested by trypsinization, washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen as cell pellets at -80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed in 500 μl of Buffer 6 supplemented with the protease inhibitors listed above plus 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells (Sigma catalog no. P8340), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 μg/ml phosvitin, and 1 mm ATP. CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and 15 units of micrococcal nuclease S7 (Roche Applied Science) were added to each cell suspension. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Portions of whole cell extracts were reserved on ice, and the remaining extracts were distributed to tubes containing bead-bound GST or GST-Cdt1. Equal amounts of total protein as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay were added to each tube. Complexes were allowed to form at 4 °C with constant rotation for 2-3 h and then washed rapidly three times with 0.75 ml of ice-cold Buffer 6 with ATP, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins in whole cell extracts and proteins bound to beads were solubilized in 1× SDS sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Equal loading of both cellular proteins and GST proteins was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the blots. Full-length human geminin was expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion from the vector pET28a in BL21 cells as described for GST-Cdt1. Partial purification by nickel affinity chromatography was performed as directed by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Geminin eluted between 175 and 200 mm imidazole; protein concentration of geminin and full-length Cdt1 was estimated by Coomassie staining of dilutions of purified protein compared with known amounts of bovine serum albumin. Where indicated, geminin was added to GST-Cdt1 along with the cell extracts. As a control, an equivalent volume of the first elution fraction from the nickel column that contained no geminin detectable by Coomassie Blue staining was added. Co-immunoprecipitations were performed as above except that in place of the GST-Cdt1-coated beads, extracts were incubated with 10 μl of anti-Cdt1 antiserum or preimmune serum plus 10 μl of Protein A-agarose (Roche Applied Science). Cdc6 and geminin were produced from plasmids pcDNA3Myc5 or pET28a by transcription and translation in vitro using T7 polymerase and rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System; Promega). Proteins were separated from unincorporated methionine and small peptides by precipitation with 50% AmSO4 and resuspended in Buffer 6 prior to incubation with GST- or GST-Cdt1-coated beads as described above. Antibodies—Anti-Cdt1 antiserum was raised in guinea pigs using recombinant GST-Cdt1 as antigen (Cocalico Biologicals). Anti-mouse Cdt1 was a gift from F. Hanaoka. Anti-Mcm2 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (catalog no. B58720). Anti-Cdc6 (sc-9964), anti-geminin (sc-13015), anti-c-Myc epitope tag (sc-40), and anti-actin (sc-8432) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Amersham Biosciences; anti-guinea pig coupled to horseradish peroxidase was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Cdc6 and Cdt1 Are Each Required for Mcm Chromatin Loading in Vivo—Deletion of the CDC6 gene from yeast cells prevents the normal association of Mcm proteins with chromatin during G1 (10Tanaka T.

Interfering with Cdc6 function in mammalian cells by expression of mutationally altered forms or microinjection of anti-Cdc6 antibodies blocks S phase entry (39Herbig U. Marlar C.A. Fanning E. Mol.

A. 1998; 95: 3603-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Presumably, these latter results are the consequence of failure of Cdc6 to load Mcm complexes onto chromatin, as is seen in model systems. We have previously shown that human Cdc6 has the ability to stimulate Mcm chromatin loading in mammalian cells (41Cook J.G. Park C.H. Burke T.W. Leone G. DeGregori J. Engel A. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); we have now directly explored the role of Cdc6 in the loading of Mcm proteins in mammalian cells using RNAi to achieve loss of Cdc6. We transfected growing human cells with a pool of double-stranded RNA specific to human Cdc6 (RNAi). Increasing amounts of RNAi led to a substantial loss of endogenous Cdc6 protein, as measured by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts with anti-Cdc6 antibody (Fig. 1A). We then examined the chromatin-bound proteins in cells lacking Cdc6 by extracting the soluble proteins with detergent and isolating the insoluble fraction, as previously described (41Cook J.G. Park C.H. Burke T.W. Leone G. DeGregori J. Engel A. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We tracked Mcm complexes in whole cell extracts (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3) and bound to chromatin (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6) by probing immunoblots for one of the six Mcm subunits, Mcm2. Actin, which is also contained in the detergent-insoluble fraction (although not bound to chromatin), was monitored as a loading control. When endogenous Cdc6 levels are reduced, Mcm2 is poorly associated with chromatin (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 4 and 5). In order to demonstrate that the effects on Mcm2 chromatin loading are specific to the loss of Cdc6, we co-transfected cells with both the Cdc6 RNAi and a plasmid for expression of mouse Cdc6. The sequences targeted by the Cdc6 RNAi have a minimum of three mismatches each with the murine Cdc6 cDNA. When Cdc6 production is maintained by the mouse clone (Fig. 1B, lane 3), Mcm2 chromatin association is similarly maintained (Fig. 1B, lane 6), indicating that Cdc6 is specifically required for the normal recruitment of the Mcm complex to chromatin in intact mammalian cells. Like Cdc6, deletion of the yeast CDT1 gene blocks the recruitment of Mcm complexes to chromatin (11Devault A. Vallen E.A. Yuan T. Green S. Bensimon A. Schwob E. Curr.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), indicating that Cdt1 function is normally required for the formation of prereplication complexes in mammalian cells. We had previously demonstrated that ectopic expression of Cdc6 from a recombinant adenovirus vector is capable of stimulating the association of Mcm subunits with chromatin in mammalian cells made quiescent by serum deprivation (41Cook J.G. Park C.H. Burke T.W. Leone G. DeGregori J. Engel A. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the activity of Cdc6 under these conditions required Cdt1 activity or if ectopic expression of Cdc6 independently induced the loading of Mcm proteins onto chromatin without a contribution from Cdt1.

It is not known, however, whether PML and other components of PML bodies function within the vicinity of the bodies or elsewhere in the nucleoplasm. In this study, we demonstrate that chromatin organization around PML bodies influences their morphology, dynamics, and structural integrity by a SUMO-1-independent mechanism. Following transcriptional inhibition and during early apoptosis, chromatin retracts from the periphery of PML bodies, coinciding with the formation of new PML-containing structures through fission of supramolecular PML-containing microbodies. Both fission and fusion of microbodies with parental PML bodies indicate a loss of structural integrity of the bodies, dependent on the state of the surrounding chromatin. This is supported by the observation that treatment of live cells with DNase I could reproduce the structural instability of PML bodies. In addition, PML bodies, which are normally surrounded by chromatin and are positionally stable, become more dynamic following these treatments, presumably due to the loss of chromatin contacts. Overexpression of SUMO-1, a modification required for PML body formation, did not prevent PML body fission, indicating that chromatin-based integrity of PML body structure occurs through a SUMO-1-independent mechanism.

Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cells expressing the PML-RARα fusion, PML nuclear bodies, which appear as 5-20 discrete foci in normal cells, are redistributed into many punctate particles throughout the nucleoplasm. Remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia is achieved by either retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide treatment, which restores both the integrity of PML bodies and regulated cell growth (1Melnick A. Licht J.D. Blood. 1999; 93: 3167-3215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PML knock-out mice are susceptible to tumor-promoting agents and exhibit chromosome instability, firmly implicating PML in tumor suppression (2Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Wang Z.G. Rivi R. Delva L. Konig A. Scheinberg D.A. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Gabrilove J.L. Warrell Jr., R.P. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heat shock, heavy metal exposure, or viral infection can also affect the integrity of PML bodies (4Maul G.G.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the integrity of PML bodies, even from their first description, is linked to the physiological state of the cell. Several models have been proposed for the function of PML bodies. In one model, PML bodies are thought to consist of aggregates of excess nuclear protein, thus having no function other than storage of proteins awaiting degradation. In a second model, PML bodies act as storage sites, modulating concentrations of nuclear proteins by sequestering them at PML bodies until required (8Negorev D. Maul G.G. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 7234-7242Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In an extension of this model, PML bodies may be sites of post-translational modification of PML body components. None of these models predict that the position and relative size of the bodies are important. We have observed, however, that position and size of bodies observed before stress are conserved following recovery from the stress event (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The above models also do not provide a basis for the positional stability of PML bodies. We propose another model, which does not exclude the previous models, but which implicates PML bodies in the regulation of nuclear functions through direct contacts with chromatin. Indirect support for this model includes the observation that chromatin-modifying proteins such as acetyltransferases (e.g. CREB-binding protein) (9Doucas V. Tini M. Egan D.A. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, PML bodies may control the local concentration of HP1α in the vicinity of centromeres through regulation of HP1α shuttling to heterochromatin via Daxx (5Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G.

PML bodies play a direct role in transcriptional regulation through the recruitment of p53, the acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein, HIPK2 (16Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The activated p53 may then leave the bodies and diffuse throughout the nucleoplasm, where it interacts with p53-activated genes. Alternatively, p53 may act on genes that are specifically localized in the immediate environment of a PML body. Similarly, transcriptional repressors such as Sp100 and Daxx (13Seller J.S. Marchio A.

Transcriptional activity on the surface of PML bodies is supported by observations of the accumulation of nascent transcripts on the surface of PML bodies (20Boisvert F.M. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and the association of specific gene loci with PML bodies (e.g. major histocompatibility complex class I gene family (21Shiels C. Islam S.A. Vatcheva R. Sasieni P. Sternberg M.J. Freemont P.S. Sheer D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3705-3716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and TP53 gene locus (22Sun Y. Durrin L.K. Krontiris T.G. Genomics. 2003; 82: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Transcription on or near the surface of PML bodies, the localization of chromatin modifying proteins and transcription factors to PML bodies, and the association of specific gene loci with these structures strongly support a critical role for the association of chromatin with PML nuclear bodies in the maintenance of normal nuclear function. PML body formation requires specific domains and post-translational modifications of PML protein. One of these domains is an N-terminal RING finger, which is required for protein-protein interactions. This RING finger is followed by two B boxes and, together with a central coiled-coil domain, constitutes the RBCC (RING/Bbox/coiled-coil) region found within all PML protein isoforms (23Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The function of the RBCC domain has been postulated to be involved with PML homodimerization/oligomerization as well as protein-protein interactions with other PML body-associated proteins. SUMO-1 (small ubiqutin-like modifier-1) modification of the PML protein occurs at lysines 65, 160, and 490. However, Lys160 appears to be the only modification site required for the formation of PML bodies. Expression of mutant PML proteins that have an amino acid substitution for Lys160 are targeted to the nucleus but are unable to form PML bodies (24Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1995; 13: 971-982Google Scholar, 25Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Will H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Further insights into the mechanisms of PML body assembly and disassembly have also been derived from the live cell analysis of these subnuclear domains during cellular stress. During heat shock for example, PML bodies dissociate into small microstructures, which lack normal PML body components, such as Sp100 and SUMO-1 (4Maul G.G. Yu E. Ishov A.M. Epstein A.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 498-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Nefkens I. Negorev D.G. Ishov A.M. Michaelson J.S. Yeh E.T. Tanguay R.M. Muller W.E. Maul G.G. J.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These small structures bleb or bud from the surface of the PML bodies and become mobile (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The remaining PML structures, or PML body remnants, are positionally stable for several hours, as are PML bodies in unstressed interphase nuclei (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 26Wiesmeijer K. Molenaar C. Bekeer I.M. Tanke H.J. Dirks R.W. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 140: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Upon recovery from stress, microstructures begin to reacquire SUMO-1 and Sp100 and can be observed to fuse with large immobile PML body remnants (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that SUMO-1 is essential to the integrity of PML bodies was also supported by results demonstrating that PML bodies, in cells overexpressing SUMO-1, are resistant to the microstructure formation in heat-stressed nuclei (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the structural integrity of PML bodies not only relies on the post-translation modification of PML by SUMO-1 but also relies on the integrity and the state of chromatin condensation. Using correlative fluorescence microscopy and electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI), we demonstrate that the integrity of PML bodies is related to the degree of association of chromatin with the protein-based cores of PML bodies. In untreated cells, PML bodies are surrounded by chromatin, which explains their positional stability. Direct physical contacts between the protein core and chromatin fibers are prevalent. Inhibition of transcription causes a reduction in these contacts through the condensation of chromatin, correlating with the fission of new PML-containing microbodies from the parental bodies. This also occurs at the early stages of apoptosis, coinciding with the cleavage of euchromatin and associated chromatin condensation (27Hendzel M.J. Nishioka W.K. Raymond Y. Allis C.D. Bazett-Jones D.P. Th'ng J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24470-24478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These newly formed microbodies dissociate from existing PML bodies and are free to diffuse through the nucleoplasm and fuse with each other or with the parental PML bodies. Finally, we confirm that PML bodies break down in response to changes in chromatin integrity by introducing exogenous nuclease (DNase I) into cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that microbodies and the PML body remnants that are generated coincidentally with these chromatin changes are biochemically indistinguishable from PML bodies in untreated cells. Further, the formation of these microbodies is not affected by SUMO-1 overexpression. We conclude that chromatin integrity and condensation state alone can influence PML body morphology and stability. Cell Lines—SK-N-SH cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum to the desired degree of confluence. U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-PML-IV (a gift from Dr. J. Taylor, previously described in Ref. 7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1600 μg/ml G418 (Wisent). Transcriptional inhibition of SK-N-SH cells was accomplished by treatment with either 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma), 80 μg/ml 5,6-dichlorobenzimidizole riboside (Sigma) or 100 μg/ml α-amanitin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 2 h. Apoptosis was induced in U2OS cells expressing GFP-PML-IV or SK-N-SH cells in DMEM containing 2 μm staurosporine (Sigma) at 37 °C. Saponin/DNase I Treatments and DNase I Transfection—U2OS or SK-N-SH cells grown on coverslips were treated on ice with 0.1% saponin/phosphate-buffered saline containing 250 μg/ml of DNase I for 5 min. Coverslips were then washed 3 times for 1 min each in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing identical concentrations of DNase I. Coverslips were then incubated at room temperature in RPMI 1640 containing DNase I. For protein transfection of DNase I, either two (12 μl) or three (18 μl) reactions of Chariot™ protein transfection agent (Active Motif) were mixed with 30 μl of DNase I (5 mg/ml). The Chariot™ agent was allowed to couple with the DNase I for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was placed on coverslips with serum-free media and incubated at 37 °C. After 1 h, DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum was added. At the specified time points of individual experiments, coverslips were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline-Triton X-100 (0.5%) for 10 min. For live cell experiments, after the appropriate incubation periods in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum, coverslips were placed on an environmental chamber containing media and imaged. All fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Leica DMR upright microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu ORCA camera. Openlab version 3.1.3 (Improvision) software was used to collect fluorescence images. Images were processed using either ImageJ version 1.28 (National Institutes of Health) or Photoshop 6.0/7.0 (Adobe). TUNEL Assay and Cell Labeling—After fixation and permeabilization, TUNEL assay labeling was preformed on coverslips. 1 μl (20 units) of terminal transferase (Roche Applied Science) was mixed with 10 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 1.5 μl of CoCl2 (1 mm), 0.3 μl of Cy3-dCTP (1 mm) (Amersham Biosciences), 0.33 μl of dCTP (0.1 mm), and 36.9 μl water for each coverslip to be analyzed. The TUNEL reaction mix was placed on the coverslips and incubated in a humidity chamber at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by washing the coverslips in 300 mm NaCl for 15 min at room temperature. PML protein was labeled by using either 5E10 antibody (1:10) (a gift from Dr. R. Van Driel) or rabbit α-PML antibody (1:1000) (Chemicon). SUMO-1 and Sp100 protein were labeled using mouse α-GMP-1 (1:500) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and rabbit α-Sp100 (1:1000) (Chemicon), respectively. HSP70 levels were monitored by labeling with mouse α-HSP70 (1:500) (Stressgen). ESI—After labeling, cells were fixed (2% gluteraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature) and then dehydrated in a series of graded ethanol washes (30, 50, 70, and 95%). Coverslips were then infiltrated with Quetol 651 resin (EM Science) for 2 h, and then 2× 2-h Quetol mix with 2% DMP-30 (hardener), as previously described (20Boisvert F.M. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Resin containing coverslips were cured overnight at 70 °C. Blocks of resin containing cells were sectioned (Leica ultramicrotome) to 70 nm, and the sections were collected on copper grids (EM Sciences). Images were collected using a Tecnai 20 TEM (FEI) equipped with an energy-filtering spectrometer (Gatan) (28Bazett-Jones D.P. Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 188-200Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nitrogen and phosphorus maps are used to distinguish protein-based from nucleic acid-based structures, without the need for exogenous stains or labels (28Bazett-Jones D.P. Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 188-200Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The precise locations of PML bodies in images were determined by correlative fluorescence microscopy and ESI (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Boisvert F.M. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 29Ren Y. Kruhlak M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PML Bodies Make Chromatin Contacts in Both Unstressed and Stressed Nuclei—We wished to determine whether PML bodies were free to move through the nucleoplasm or whether their mobility is restricted by a nuclear component. We followed the dynamic behavior of PML bodies in live U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-PML-IV. We observed that PML bodies retain their relative positions within the nucleus over time periods of a few hours (Fig. 1A), with the exception of minor movements due to cellular shape changes. The relative sizes of the PML bodies in a given cell are conserved over several hours. In some cells, new PML bodies appear during the course of imaging, consistent with reports that PML bodies increase in size and number during interphase (29Ren Y. Kruhlak M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These new structures also appear to maintain their positional stability within the nucleus. The positional stability of PML bodies could be explained by extensive contacts with chromatin or by attachment to an underlying protein-based structure or nuclear matrix (30Chang K.S. Fan Y.H. Andreeff M. Liu J. Mu Z.M. Blood. 1995; 85: 3646-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether we could observe such a structural basis for PML body positional stability, we used correlative fluorescence microscopy and ESI (31Drouin A. Schmitt A. Masse J.M. Cieutat A.M. Fichelson S. Cramer E.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 271: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). ESI offers the ability to distinguish between protein-, DNA-, or RNA-based structures in the nucleus (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Boisvert F.M. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We observed that the protein-based cores of PML bodies are completely surrounded by and make physical contacts with chromatin fibers, predominantly 30-nm fibers. Nitrogen maps (green) and phosphorus maps (red) permit us to identify chromatin, ribonucleoprotein structures (RNPs), and protein-based structures (Fig. 1B). In merged nitrogen and phosphorus maps, chromatin appears as bright yellow fibers. RNPs appear less yellow (circled RNP in Fig. 1B), due to a lower P/N ratio than chromatin. RNPs, exhibiting a distinct morphology from chromatin, consisting of a more punctuate distribution of granules between 5 and 10 nm in diameter. Protein-based structures appear as green in the merged nitrogen and phosphorus maps. The high density of chromatin (arrowheads) around the bodies provides a physical barrier that may account for their positional stability. The protein cores demonstrate radial symmetry, and images from serial sections indicate that the cores of the bodies are spherical in shape (not shown). In addition, protein-based “spokes” are frequently observed, which make physical contacts with both the cores of the bodies and the chromatin on the periphery. A final feature that is typical of PML bodies is the accumulation of RNPs near their periphery (Fig. 1B, circled). To test whether the association of PML bodies with chromatin and RNPs may have functional consequences, we examined nuclei at the ultrastructural level from cells that had been heat-stressed. Under such conditions, most transcription is repressed, with the exception of genes involved with the heat shock response (32Morrimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). We observed several major differences between PML bodies in stressed cells compared with control cells. First, the protein-based cores of over 80% of PML bodies lose their typical radial symmetry (Fig. 1C, circled structures). Instead, the protein cores display extended length/width ratios, confirmed in serial sections (not shown). In addition, the protein-based cores are less dense, displaying a more open and fibrous appearance (Fig. 1, compare the cores in B and C). In heat-stressed cells, it is difficult to delineate the edges of the PML accumulations from other protein-based fibers and globular depositions that are present both in the vicinity of PML bodies and throughout the nucleoplasm (within versus outside the circled regions in Fig. 1C). A second difference we observed relates to the organization of chromatin in heat-stressed nuclei. Large blocks of condensed chromatin were observed throughout the nucleoplasm (data not shown), supporting a previous study in which heat stress led to an increase in chromatin condensation (33Plehn-Dujowich D. Bell P. Ishov A.M. Baumann C. Maul G.G. Chromosoma. 2000; 109: 266-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the vicinity of PML bodies, however, the chromatin is less densely distributed (Fig. 1, C and D). Instead of dense packing of 30-nm fibers, 10-nm fibers are observed, separated by large spaces. These chromatin fibers frequently make physical connections to the fibrous protein cores of PML bodies (arrowheads in Fig. 1C). The 10-nm nature of these fibers is illustrated in Fig. 1, D and E. Nucleosome-based fibers are illustrated in the higher magnification insets (i and ii). The basis for defining these structures as nucleosomes is their morphology (11-nm diameter), some displaying a doughnut-shaped appearance in phosphorus-enhanced images (consistent with en face projections) and their nitrogen and phosphorus content (34Bazett-Jones D.P. Hendzel M.J. Kruhlak M.J. Micron. 1999; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, in heat-stressed cells, we never observe clearly identifiable accumulations of RNPs on the periphery of PML bodies. This is consistent with the loss of the 5′-fluorouridine incorporation on the periphery of PML bodies (data not shown), which is observed in nonstressed cells (20Boisvert F.M. Hendzel M.J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Chromatin Condensation by Transcriptional Inhibition or Apoptosis Causes a Loss in PML Body Integrity—Since major structural and compositional features of PML bodies correlate with transcriptional repression arising from heat stress, we decided to test for changes in PML body structure and composition by inhibiting transcription directly. SK-N-SH cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (ActD), fixed, and labeled for PML (Fig. 2A). Using DAPI as a marker for chromatin, we observed a global reorganization of chromatin in the nuclei of ActD-treated cells (+ActD), which was characterized by a less uniform distribution of DAPI signal compared with control cells (-ActD). This visual impression was supported by line scans of DAPI-stained cells (Fig. 2A, inset). We also observed the appearance of numerous, small PML-containing structures following transcriptional inhibition. In the example shown, the number of PML-containing structures in untreated cells is less than 10 per cell (cell i and cell ii), whereas the number in treated cells is over 30 (cell iii and cell iv). All of the PML-containing structures contain two other PML body-associated components, Sp100 and SUMO-1, at levels indistinguishable from PML bodies in control cells (Fig. 2B). We chose these two biochemical markers, since they are labile markers following heat stress (7Eskiw C.H. Dellaire G. Mymryk J. Bazett-Jones D.P. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4455-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and are lost in early stages of mitosis (preliminary data). We refer to these newly formed PML containing structures as “microbodies,” since they contain these characteristic markers for PML bodies. Similar results were obtained with other transcriptional inhibitors (α-amanitin and 5,6-dichlorobenzimidizole riboside) (data not shown). Since both heat stress and transcription inhibition with drugs lead to major changes in chromatin organization in the immediate vicinity of PML bodies and the organization of PML-containing structures, we wished to address whether the loss of euchromatin in the early stages of apoptosis by endogenous nucleases (27Hendzel M.J.

Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar) would also lead to the disruption of PML bodies. Cells expressing GFP-PML-IV were treated with the apoptotic inducer, staurosporine, and observed by fluorescence microscopy over time (Fig. 3A). Within 30 min of staurosporine treatment, new PML-containing structures begin to appear. These small PML accumulations contain significant levels of Sp100 and SUMO-1 (Supplemental Fig. 1), similar to the structures that form during transcriptional inhibition (Fig. 2A). We observed that these new structures are highly mobile, moving several hundred nanometers during 1-s intervals (Supplemental Movies 1-5). Furthermore, the large parental PML bodies present prior"

The existence of a large and conserved group of proteins with a clear physiologically relevant unfolded state serves as a paradigm to understand the structural basis of this state. The “thermodynamic hypothesis” of protein folding, as was introduced more than 40 years ago, suggests that the folded state of a given protein represents a global minimum of free energy (1Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). Although this theory is widely valid, there is a considerable group of “natively unfolded” proteins (as were first denoted by Mandelkow and coauthors (2Schweers O. Schönbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A.

The unfolded state of this group of proteins does not signify a requirement for the activity of molecular chaperones to overcome a large energetic barrier to attain a global minimum energy, but a truly energetically favorable unfolded state. The natively unfolded state is also distinct from the misfolded state in which proteins self-assemble to form large supramolecular assemblies such as amyloid fibrils (7Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2652-2657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This protein is a part of a bimolecular complex that acts as the “plasmid addiction” module of the phage (12Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The addiction module mechanism assures an efficient inheritance of the extrachromosomal phage and is based on the differential physiological stability of its two components, the stable toxin Doc and the labile antitoxin Phd. Upon a loss of the phage in a postsegregational event, no de novo synthesis of either the toxin or antitoxin occurs. Because of the physiological instability of the antitoxin, only the toxic component of the module is ultimately retained within the cured cells, causing the death of cured cells. Consistent with the fact that Phd is recognized and degraded by the ClpXP “quality control” machinery of infected cells (13Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we suggested that its unfolded state is the key to its physiological instability, thus serving as a critical element in the function of the TA 1The abbreviations used are: TA, toxin-antitoxin; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. module. Many “damaged” or misfolded proteins are identified and eliminated by the ClpXP system. These unfolded target proteins may be recognized by ectopic exposure of hydrophobic amino acids, which are normally buried within the hydrophobic core of the protein. Therefore, we assumed that ClpXP recognizes the unfolded Phd protein based on its structural property because it may appear as damaged protein. TA systems were also identified on chromosomes in both bacteria and archea, but not in eukaryotes (14Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M.

These systems share the same paradigm of a stable toxin and an unstable antidote, organization as a polycistronic operon, and the small size of the protein components (70-100 amino acids). Although TA systems are widely present, their physiological role is not fully understood. It is assumed that the systems play a significant role in survival under stringent conditions (14Christensen S.K. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1389-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Pedersen K. Zavialov A.V. Pavlov M.Y. Elf J. Gerdes K. Ehrenberg M.

Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The absolute lack of TA systems in eukaryotes, as opposed to their ubiquitous presence in bacteria and archaea, makes the systems a very attractive antibacterial target. Unlike conventional antibiotics, there is no need for the external introduction of toxic material that may affect the host as well. The blockage of the toxin-antitoxin physical interaction may result in the execution of the inherent toxic potential of the toxin. In this work, we clearly demonstrate that the Escherichia coli YefM antitoxin protein, although showing very low homology to the Phd protein, is also natively unfolded. Pair-constrained bioinformatics analysis allowed the identification of a large family of natively unfolded host proteins that are based on the Phd-YefM structural framework. The chromosomal organization of the proteins implies that they are a part of functional TA systems in a related group of bacteria, including some major pathogens. The unfolded YefM-like proteins are an attractive target for the development of antibacterial agents because the toxin partner of the TA module recognizes a linear determinant with the antitoxin, which could be mimicked by a therapeutic agent. Gene Sequence Identification and Alignments—Sequences related to the yefM and yoeB genes of E. coli were identified by a pair-constrained bioinformatic analysis. Sequences were identified using TBLASTN and PSI-BLAST searches (20Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of nonredundant microbial genomes data base at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Putative yefM and yoeB homolog sequences were obtained and examined for a toxin-antitoxin gene pair module in the chromosome. Low homology unpaired sequences were discarded. Alignments were produced by ClustalW (21Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) with default settings and edited using JALVIEW editor. Cloning of the System Genes into the pBAD-TOPO Expression Vector—DNA fragments containing the coding sequence of yefM, yoeB, and both yefM-yoeB were produced by PCR using the chromosomal DNA of E. coli K-12 MC1061 and the primers ATGYEFM (5′-ATGAACTGTACAAAAGAGG-3′) and YEFMEND (5′-GACAAGCTTAGTTTCACTCAATG-3′) to amplify the yefM gene; GTGYOEB (5′-GTGAAACTAATCTGGTCTG-3′) and YOEBEND1 (5′-TGAAGCTTTTCAATAATGATAACGAC-3′) to amplify the yoeB gene; and ATGYEFM and YOEBEND1 to amplify the yefM-yoeB genes together. The PCR fragments, using the pBAD-TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), were cloned into the pBAD-TOPO vector to generate pBAD-yefM, pBAD-yoeB, and pBAD-yefMyoeB. The plasmids were transformed into an E. coli TOP10 strain (Invitrogen). Growth Rate Analysis—E. coli TOP10 bacteria transformed with pBAD-yefM, pBAD-yoeB, and pBAD-yefMyoeB were cultured overnight in LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The next day, the three cultures were diluted and adjusted to an absorbance of ∼0.01 (A600) in LB-ampicillin. Next, each culture was divided into two equal volumes; at time zero, the first half was added with 0.2% l-arabinose to induce expression of the target gene and the second half with 0.2% d-glucose to suppress low transcription from the pBAD promoter. All cultures were grown at 37 °C/200 rpm, and samples were taken sequentially approximately every 40-60 min for 9 h. Cells density was measured by its absorbance at 600 nm. To inspect the growth rate for gene induction during logarithmic growth phase, the same analysis assay as above was conducted, with the exception of the time of induction. Cultures were divided, and expression was induced (or suppressed) at the time they had reached an absorbance of ∼0.45 (A600). Colony Formation Analysis—E. coli TOP10 bacteria transformed with pBAD-yefM, pBAD-yoeB, and pBAD-yefMyoeB were grown in LB broth at 37 °C containing ampicillin as indicated. After overnight growth, cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.01 in LB-ampicillin medium. The cultures were then grown at 37 °C until an A600 value of 0.5 was reached. At that point, cells were diluted 104-107 times in 10-fold dilution steps and applied as 5-μl dropouts on LB-ampicillin-agar plates containing arabinose in the following decreasing arabinose dilutions: 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.02%, 0.005%, and 0.0005%. In addition, a negative control plate without arabinose and supplemented with 0.2% glucose was plated. All plates were incubated at 37 °C for at least 20 h. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of YefM from E. coli—The DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of yefM, flanked by primer-encoded BsrGI and HindIII sites, was produced by a PCR using E. coli strain MC1061 chromosome as template and oligonucleotide primers YEFMSTART (5′-GTACAATGAACTGTACAAAAGAAG-3′) and YEFMEND (5′-GACAAGCTTAGTTTCACTCAATG-3′). The product was digested with BsrGI and HindIII enzymes (New England Biolabs), cloned into the BsrGI and HindIII restriction sites of a pET42a expression vector (Novagen) in fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Transformed bacteria were grown in 2YT broth at 37 °C/200 rpm to an A600 of ∼0.4. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 1 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3 (PBS; 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4), protease inhibitor mixture as recommended (Sigma), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by three passages through a French pressure cell (1,400 p.s.i.). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C followed by a 0.45-μm filtration. The supernatant was applied onto a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with PBS, pH 7.3. The protein was eluted using 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione. YefM proteins were separated from the GST using 16 units of factor Xa protease (Novagen)/1 mg of YefM fusion. After a 14-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Two different methods were applied for YefM purification. In the first method, gel filtration was conducted to remove the GST and linker protein (∼40 kDa) from YefM (∼11 kDa) using a Sepharose HR 10/30 (fast protein liquid chromatography) gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) and a fast protein liquid chromatography instrument (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted with PBS, pH 7.3, 0.8 ml/min, and a peak that included the ∼11-kDa YefM proteins was collected after 13 min. Fractions containing the YefM protein were completely purified using 1 μmol of immobilized glutathione-agarose (Sigma) agitated for 16 h at room temperature. At this point, YefM was greater than 95% pure as estimated by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE. In the second purification method, the YefM and GST protein mixture was divided into 0.5-ml fractions, boiled for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants, containing the purified YefM, were collected and united. To determine YefM concentration, tyrosine absorbance measurement in 0.1 m KOH was used. Protein concentrations were calculated using the extinction coefficients of 2391 m-1 cm-1 (293.2 nm in 0.1 m KOH) for single tyrosine. The molecular mass of YefM was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry work station (Applied Biosystems). α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was used as the matrix. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST-YoeB from E. coli—The DNA fragment containing the coding sequence of yoeB, flanked by primer-encoded EcoRI and HindIII sites, was produced by a PCR using E. coli strain MC1061 chromosome as template and oligonucleotide primers YOEBSTART (5′-AAAGGACATGAATTCGTGAAACTAATC-3′) and YOEBEND2 (5′-CCTTTGAAGCTTTTCAATAATGATAA-3′). The product was digested with EcoRI and HindIII enzymes (New England Biolabs), cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites of the pET42a expression vector in fusion to GST, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. Bacteria were grown, expressed, and lysed in the same manner described above for GST-YefM fusion. The supernatant was applied onto a 1-ml glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with PBS, pH 7.3. The bound protein was eluted using 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione. Eluted fractions containing the GST-YoeB protein were collected and assessed quantitatively by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE. Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD spectra were obtained using an AVIV 202 spectropolarimeter equipped with temperature-controlled sample holder and a 5-mm path length cuvette. Mean residual ellipticity, [θ], was calculated as [θ]=[100×θ×m]/[c×L] where θ is the observed ellipticity, m is the mean residual weight, c is the concentration in mg/ml, and L is the path length in cm. All experiments were performed in PBS, pH 7.3, at a protein concentration of 10 μm. For thermal denaturation experiments, samples were equilibrated at each temperature for 0.5 min, and CD ellipticity at 222 nm and 217 nm was averaged for 1 min. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)-Infrared spectra were recorded using a Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR spectrometer with a DTGS detector. The sample, 1 μg of lyophilized YefM suspended in 30 μl of PBS in D2O, pD 7.3, was suspended on a CaF2 plate. The measurements were taken using a 4 cm-1 resolution and 2,000 scans averaging. The transmittance minima values were determined by the OMNIC analysis program (Nicolet). Analysis of YefM Stability—Overnight culture of E. coli carrying the pBAD-yefM plasmid was grown at 37 °C/200 rpm in LB broth to stationary phase (A600 = 1.4). YefM expression was then induced for 10 min with 0.2% arabinose and subsequently treated with 200 μg/ml rifampicin and 0.2% glucose to repress further expression from PBAD promoter. Aliquots of 2 ml were removed before and at 15-min intervals after repression and analyzed by Western blot (see below) to assess YefM quantity in bacteria. Densitometer assessment of YefM was achieved using an ImageScanner (Amersham Biosciences) and the ImageMaster one-dimensional prime (version 3.01) program (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots (2 ml) were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 80 μl of double-distilled water. Samples of 60 μl were added to 20 μl of 4× sample buffer, and the remaining 20 μl was used to quantify the total protein using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce). Aliquots containing equal total protein amounts were loaded on a Tris-Tricine SDS 15% polyacrylamide slab gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Bio-Rad). The detection of YefM was performed using anti-YefM serum raised in rabbit. The membrane was then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies, and YefM proteins were detected through the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction after an exposure to a sensitive film. Amino Acid Composition and Charge-Hydrophobicity Values Analysis—The rate of occurrence of each amino acid in the YefM family proteins (PMi) was determined by averaging its 30 frequencies in each of the 30 YefM homolog sequences. The general amino acid occurrence statistics (PGi) were compiled by the Rockefeller authors using the NCBI data base (prowl.rockefeller.edu/aainfo/masses.htm). The comparison ordinates between the amino acid occurrences are given by their fractional difference: (PMi - PGi)/PGi. The variances of these ratios were calculated as Var(PMi)/(PGi)2. The mean hydrophobicity and the mean net charge of the YefM and the YefM homologs proteins were calculated as described by Uversky and coauthors (3Uversky V.N. Gillespie J.R. Fink A.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 415-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). Peptide Array Analysis—Tridecamer peptides corresponding to consecutive overlapping sequence of YefM protein were arrayed on a cellulose membrane matrix and covalently bound to a Whatman 50 cellulose support (Whatman). Approximately 50 μg of soluble GST-YoeB proteins were examined for their selective peptide binding ability, on the basis of YefM-YoeB putative interaction. In the case of a low stringency binding procedure, membrane was washed briefly in 100% ethanol, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and then blocked for 4 h using 5% (w/v) non-fat milk in TBS. Next, the membrane was washed three times in TBS + 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated for 14 h with 10 ml of GST-YoeB solution at slow shacking at 4 °C. Subsequently, the membrane was washed once in TBS-T. Membrane was then added with 10 ml of TBS, mouse anti-GST antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody in the appropriate titers. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the membrane was washed briefly with TBS-T and TBS. When high stringency binding procedure was performed, washing steps were extensive and multiple. Moreover, the washing step of the blocking solution was reduced to a single brief wash. Bound GST-YoeB proteins were detected through the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction after an exposure to a sensitive film. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Analysis—Binding affinities were evaluated by SPR using BIAcore™2000 (BIAcore Inc.). Approximately 30 resonance units of the peptide NH2-RTISYSEARQNLS-COOH, denoting the YefM recognition determinant sequence, was immobilized onto a research grade sensor chip CM5 using amine coupling kit (BIAcore) as described by the manufacturer. GST-YoeB proteins (at 12.5, 25, and 50 nm concentrations) were passed over the chip surface in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, at room temperature at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The chip surface was regenerated with 10 mm HCl in water after each run and reequilibrated with Tris buffer. Sensogram data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software package. The rate constants were calculated for the binding data using local fitting for the data set as described in the BIAevaluation 3.0 manual with the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Identification of the yefM-yoeB System Genes—The YefM protein of E. coli was suggested to be homologous to the Phd protein (23Pomerantsev A.P. Golovliov I.R. Ohara Y. Mokrievich A.N. Obuchi M. Norqvist A. Kuoppa K. Pavlov V.M. Plasmid. 2001; 46: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and, similar to the Phd antitoxin, it was considered to serve as the antitoxin partner of a YoeB toxin. However, this homology is very low and in fact not statistically significant (E = 18, according to pairwise BLAST analysis). This is still very intriguing because the Phd protein appears to have unique structural properties and shows no clear homology to any other proteins. To justify the suggested “YefM-Phd protein family” term (23Pomerantsev A.P. Golovliov I.R. Ohara Y. Mokrievich A.N. Obuchi M. Norqvist A. Kuoppa K. Pavlov V.M. Plasmid. 2001; 46: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), systematic exploration of YefM and Phd protein sequences is essentially required. Homologs of YefM were demonstrated to reside on the Francisella tularensis plasmid pFNL10 (23Pomerantsev A.P. Golovliov I.R. Ohara Y. Mokrievich A.N. Obuchi M. Norqvist A. Kuoppa K. Pavlov V.M. Plasmid. 2001; 46: 210-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and on a multidrug resistance plasmid identified in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium (24Grady R. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The existence of homologs of YefM and YoeB protein in bacterial chromosomes was also suggested (24Grady R. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, many unpaired YefM and YoeB homologs were presented (24Grady R. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), indicating that a methodical YefM and YoeB homolog pairing is required to verify their authenticity as a functional module. Therefore, we used a pair-constrained homology search. In this search, a combination of the values of homology (albeit low) for both putative toxin and antitoxin taken together with their chromosomal organization was taken into account. Only pairs of proteins that revealed paradigmatic TA genetic organization, in which the physical distance between the pair of proteins is less than 100 bp, were regarded as putative TA systems. The resulting findings are shown in Fig. 1. In view of this homology analysis, it became clear that a subset of the YefM homolog sequences which are highly similar to Phd are located adjacent to prophage P1 Doc protein homologs, instead of YoeB (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A). Therefore, we relate these sequences as hypothetical phd genes. This group includes translations of genomic sequences from Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Those bacteria are actually closer in sequence to Phd (with an E value of 2 × 10-9, 7 × 10-9, and 2 × 10-4, respectively) than to E. coli YefM (E = 2 × 10-4, 3 × 10-4, 0.8, respectively). Anyway, these two systems may exist together: the Y. enterocolitica bacterium includes both YefM-YoeB and Phd-Doc homolog sequences on its genome (see Figs. 1 and 2). Alignment of all of the homologous translated sequences was conducted to estimate their rate of conservation. YefM homologs alignment (Fig. 2A) consists 29 different homologs, in addition to the Phd protein sequence of phage P1 (last sequence). The toxins alignment (Fig. 2B) is divided into two sections: the upper panel includes the YoeB homologs, consisting of 26 different sequences, and the lower panel includes the Doc homologs alignment, consisting of 3 different Doc homologs in addition to the Doc protein sequence of the phage P1 itself. YoeB and Doc homologs cannot be engaged into a reliable alignment because of their far diverse sequences. The yefM-yoeB Genes Act as a TA System—To examine the toxic and antitoxic effect that the expressed proteins have on the cell, YefM and YoeB were overexpressed separately and together as an operon using the pBAD-TOPO plasmid. E. coli strain TOP10 cells, carrying the plasmids, were grown in LB medium, and 0.2% arabinose was added at time zero. A significant effect was observed in these bacteria (Fig. 3, A-C). The overexpression of the putative toxin, YoeB, inhibited the bacterial growth to maximum A600 of ∼0.15 (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of both YefM and YoeB as an operon abolished this toxic effect, indicating a TA relationship between YoeB and YefM (Fig. 3C), as accepted (24Grady R. Hayes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1419-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, overexpression of YefM alone had displayed an effect on cell growth similar to that by YoeB (Fig. 3A). The same results had been witnessed when cells expressing the system genes were induced during the logarithmic growth stages (Fig. 3, D-F): 0.2% arabinose was added to the different cultures at the time they reached A600 of ∼0.45. In the cases of YefM or YoeB expression, absolute growth inhibition had been observed after less than 1 h (Fig. 3, D and E) as cells reached ∼0.7 A600, whereas the expression of both genes together enabled normal growth (Fig. 3F). To confirm that the YefM is an actual antitoxin, we tested the colony formation capability of each of the clones at decreasing expression levels (Fig. 3G). On the whole, yefM clones have consistently demonstrated a certain degree of growth in all arabinose concentrations, whereas yoeB clones did not form colonies at most concentrations. Moreover, in the presence of 0.005% arabinose, growth of the yoeB clone was disabled, whereas the yefM clone still demonstrated clear growth, indicating that YoeB is a real toxin whereas YefM displays toxicity upon high expression levels. Biophysical Characterization of YefM-YefM Is Natively Unfolded—YefM was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” either by performing gel filtration (obtaining ∼0.1 mg/ml) or by boiling GST and YefM proteins subsequent to factor Xa cleavage (∼0.35 mg/ml). The far-UV CD spectra of the purified YefM protein (in both purification methods) at increasing temperatures (25, 37, 42 °C) show a typical random coil pattern with a minimum in the vicinity of 200 nm (25Jenness D.D.

Binding proteins act as primary receptors in the ABC systems of bacterial transport (1Boos W. Lucht J.M. Niedhart F. Ingraham R.C. Lin E. Low K. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). The importance of these systems is highlighted by the observation that their components form the largest group of paralogous genes in bacterial and archaeal genomes, 2% or more of all genes present (2Tatusov R.L.

The binding proteins are characterized by a two-domain architecture, with a connecting hinge; open forms are thought to be most common in the absence of ligand. When the cognate ligand binds, a closed form of the binding protein is stabilized that can then act together with the membrane-bound permease and a cytoplasmic ATPase to mediate transport of the ligand across the cell membrane. The conformational changes associated with ligand binding have often been referred to as classic examples of hinge motion (3Gerstein M. Lesk A.M. Chothia C.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2573-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Adams M.D. Maguire D.J. Oxender D.L. J. Biol.

Swartz D. Adams P.S. Luck L.A. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2002; 20: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A related leucine/isoleucine/valine-binding protein (LIV, ∼80% amino acid sequence identity) can also bind leucine, with a KD of 0.40 μm. In contrast to LBP, LIV does not bind phenylalanine but does recognize isoleucine (KD 0.40 μm) and valine (KD 0.7 μm) (5Adams M.D. Maguire D.J. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6209-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, LIV interacts weakly with threonine, serine, and alanine (8Rahmanian M. Claus D.R. Oxender D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LBP and LIV use the same permease system to facilitate entry of bound ligands into the cell. An open ligand-free structure of LBP was solved previously (9Sack J.S. Trakhanov S.D. Tsigannik I.H. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), together with the equivalent form of LIV (10Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Small-angle x-ray scattering studies indicate that closure of LIV (and presumably LBP) is indeed associated with ligand binding (11Olah G.A. Trakhanov S. Trewhella J. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the only complex structure reported to date represents leucine bound to one domain of the open LIV protein (10Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the absence of structures in the closed ligand-bound state, however, the differences in LBP/LIV specificity have been difficult to understand. We report here the structure of an open ligand-free form of LBP with a different conformation than that reported previously. Complexes with leucine and phenylalanine as seen in the closed protein further show the basis of ligand binding and specificity, as well as documenting the conformational changes that occur in association with their binding. Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmid pKSty (5Adams M.D. Maguire D.J. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6209-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) kindly provided by the Oxender laboratory was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown to A600 0.7 in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Protein production was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested and standard sucrose osmotic shock procedures were used to release periplasmic proteins. Protein purification was performed on DEAE-Sephacel column using a 0–0.25 m NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Purified protein, typically 75 mg/liter cell culture, was dialyzed against several changes of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, 0.02% NaN3, and stored at –20 °C until use. Purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization and Data Collection—All crystals were obtained using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method (12McPherson A.J. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals. John Wiley and Sons, New York1982Google Scholar), with a protein concentration of 6 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the open form (LBP-apo), 2 μl of protein were mixed with 2 μl of mother liquor containing 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 5000, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 10 mm CoCl2. For the complex with phenylalanine (LBP-Phe), the protein was mixed with the amino acid (final concentration 1.5 mm) and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. 2 μl of this solution were then mixed with 20% PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.1 m ammonium sulfate. For the form with leucine bound (LBP-Leu), the protein was incubated with 1.2 mm ligand for 24 h. The protein was then mixed with an equal volume of 20% PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 20% 2-propanol. All crystals grew within 1 week and had a size of ∼0.5 × 0.01 × 0.01 mm3. Prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen, all crystals were soaked in mother liquor containing 20% glycerol. Data were collected using frozen crystals at beamline I711 at MAX-lab, Lund Sweden, processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and merged using programs of the CCP4 package (14Collaborative Computing Project Number, 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

After combination of the two domains, rebuilding using the graphics program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Open table in a new tab For the LBP-Phe structure, the same search models and resolution range were used in AMoRe. Two complete molecules were located in the asymmetric unit, and following rigid body fitting that allowed the domains to move independently in CNS (21Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The ligand was not included in the calculation of the first electron density maps but clear, positive density was visible between the two structural domains. After refinement and rebuilding, including the addition of ligand and water, the final R-factor was 18.9% and R-free was 22.2% (Table II). The program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4152) Google Scholar) was used for the molecular replacement solution of LBP-Leu. A complete protein molecule from the refined LBP-Phe structure was used as search model. Four clear peaks were found after the rotation search, giving a final correlation coefficient of 61.8%. Again, ligand was apparent even in the first electron density maps. Several cycles of refinement in REFMAC5 using the data to 2.4 Å resolution (90% complete) were followed by manual rebuilding. Water molecules were added using CNS. The incomplete data between 2.4 and 2.0 Å were added in the last cycles of refinement, which resulted in a slight improvement of the electron density maps; this resulted in a final R-factor of 21.3% and an R-free of 25.3%. The introduction of non-crystallographic symmetry did not result in any significant improvement of maps or statistics and so was not used. Statistics relating to the final refined model are summarized in Table II. Other Methods—Coordinate sets used for comparison with LBP were: 2LBP (9Sack J.S. Trakhanov S.D. Tsigannik I.H. Quiocho F.A.

Accession Numbers—Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with entry codes 1USG for the apo form, and 1USI and 1USK for the phenylalanine- and leucine-bound forms, respectively. Overall Structures—LBP is comprised of two domains, each consisting of a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices. The structure of a new open form of LBP was obtained by molecular replacement, using the two domains of the previously reported apo structure (9Sack J.S. Trakhanov S.D. Tsigannik I.H. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) separately in the rotational and translational searches (Fig. 1A). This apo form is opened by an additional 14° compared with the previous structure (Fig. 1, B and C). The individual domains of the two open forms are however very similar with r.m.s.d. values of 0.8 Å for domain 1 and 0.4 Å for domain 2 when all Cαs are included. The largest differences in domain 1 are in a surface loop containing residues 292–301 and two loops directly involved in ligand binding (residues 12–18 and 99–103). The biggest changes in domain 2 are in a surface helix containing residues 232–238, which is distant from the ligand-binding site. None of these changes appears to be of functional significance. The structures of LBP bound to leucine and phenylalanine were also solved by molecular replacement (Fig. 1, D and E). In each case, the closed structures have r.m.s.d. values of 0.2–0.3 Å when the Cα atoms of all molecules in the respective asymmetric units are compared. The overall r.m.s.d. values between the two ligand bound forms are only slightly larger, 0.3–0.5 Å. In both closed structures one domain has rotated ∼55° with respect to the other when compared with the new apo form (Fig. 1F) and ∼40° to the previously solved apo form. The sense of the rotation is the same in each case, i.e. the original apo form represents a conformational intermediate along the pathway between the new apo and the closed forms. The domains remain rather rigid upon closing of the protein: r.m.s.d. values in Cα position are 0.6–0.8 Å for domain 1 and 0.7–0.8 Å for domain 2. In domain 1, two loops on the outside of the protein distant from the ligand-binding site are affected (residues 34–44 and 292–302). In domain 2, residues 188–192 have different conformations, as do 10 residues at the C terminus. The open conformation is stabilized by one new contact point on the outside surface of the hinge. The hydroxyl group of Thr127 interacts with the main-chain oxygen of Ser123, as well as one of the carboxylate groups of Asp330. The conformation of the new apo form is also stabilized by the crystal packing, as domain 1 from one molecule is placed between the domains in an adjacent molecule, so preventing the protein from closing. The electron density in the present structures supports the version of LBP found in the genomic sequence (20Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6024) Google Scholar) rather than that in the earlier report (33Landick R. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8257-8261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three changes (Ile20 → Asp, Glu27 → Arg and Ala103 → Asn) are clearly observed in the electron density in all structures. In all of the new structures, the electron density also clearly shows an unusual non-proline cis peptide between residues Gly75 and His76 that was not noted previously; this does not appear to have any functional significance. The Hinge—As seen in most other periplasmic binding proteins of this class, the two domains of LBP are connected by a three-stranded hinge. The hinge segments are here designated connection I (residues 117–121), connection II (residues 248–252) and connection III (residues 325–331). Connections I and III form “direct” links between the β-sheets of the two domains, while connection II is interrupted by a helix (residues 253–268). On opening and closing, most of the changes in main-chain torsion angles occur in connections I and III; these two segments appear to determine the sense of the motion observed, while connection II merely adapts. The helix linked to connection II is flexible and apparently affected by crystal packing. The loop near Gly100 in the apo structure is also influenced by hinge movements in the neighboring connection I, as well as by crystal packing. Water molecules mediate interactions between connections I and III (Fig. 2, A and B); none are associated with connection II. When the protein is open, one water molecule (W1) forms hydrogen bonds with Ala118–O and Leu326–N. A second water (W2) hydrogen bonds with Leu120–N and Leu326–O as well as another water molecule (W3), which in turn hydrogen bonds to Leu326–O and Phe329–N. When the protein closes, W1 retains its interactions with domain 1, but the other two waters adjust to the new structural setting. W2 loses its hydrogen bond with Leu120 but gains one with W1. W3 also moves, losing its interactions to 326–O and 329–N, and gaining new ones with W2, Leu120–N and Phe329–O. The electron density for W2 was comparatively weak in two of the four molecules in the LBP-Leu structure but was strong for both molecules in the LBP-Phe structure; this may reflect the weaker and less complete crystallographic data for the leucine complex. Ligand Binding—Ligands bind to LBP in a cleft formed between the two domains of the closed proteins. Phenylalanine and leucine are bound in very similar fashion (Fig. 3, A and B), with both hydrogen-bonding and non-polar contributions. The amino group of the ligand in each case forms hydrogen bonds with Gly100, Thr102, and Glu226. The carboxylate groups of a ligand form hydrogen bonds with Ser79, Thr102, and Tyr202. The distances between the polar atoms are very similar for all structures with ligand bound (Fig. 3). Most of these interactions are contributed by domain 1. The non-polar groups of the ligand-binding site are all aromatic. Trp18, Tyr202, and Tyr276 make van der Waals contacts with the hydrophobic side chains of the ligands, while Tyr150 stacks on their planar main-chain groups (Fig. 4). When ligand is bound, the side chain of Tyr276 (along with the associated 272–276 loop) moves away from the cleft, thus providing the space required. This motion is exaggerated slightly to accommodate the larger side chain of the phenylalanine ligand in all of the available structures (Fig. 4B). More van der Waals interactions are found for the phenylalanine ligand, which may be correlated to its tighter binding (13 inter-atomic distances < 4 Å are found for leucine, as compared with 33 for phenylalanine). The side chain of Trp18 also changes its conformation upon ligand binding, rotating almost 130° in all ligand-bound structures (Fig. 4A); again the change makes room for the ligand. Crystal packing probably explains some minor differences in the observed conformer of this residue in the two apo structures. Comparison with LIV—The LBP structures are very similar to that of LIV, as expected from the ∼80% amino acid sequence identity. Compared with the previously reported apo LBP structure, the available apo-LIV structure is opened by ∼2°, again demonstrating the variations possible in the opening angle. Comparing domain 1 of the new apo structure to that of LIV, the r.m.s.d. is 0.6 Å when the loop containing residues 291–298 is omitted. LBP has two inserted amino acids at this point that are not found in LIV. For domain 2 of the apo structures, r.m.s.d. values in the Cα position of ∼0.5 Å are observed. The hinges of the two proteins are similar but not identical. In LIV, both W1 and W2 as described above are present in the model, but not W3; this is perhaps an artifact of the relatively low resolution of the LIV crystallographic data. Ser123 of LBP is replaced with an aspartic acid in LIV, which could form hydrogen bonds with W2 when the protein is closed. The carboxylate oxygens of the aspartate would then occupy the same space as W3 in the closed LBP structures. At present, the only ligand-bound form of LIV is an open one for which coordinates are not available (10Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this 2.4-Å structure, leucine is bound only to domain 1, making hydrogen-bonding interactions that are highly analogous to those we observe for amino acids bound to LBP. The hydrophobic portion of the leucine bound in the LIV structure, however, is reportedly closer to domain 1, especially Leu77. The authors indicate that ligand and Leu77 are close enough to be stacked, which is not the case in our structures, where the average distance between the leucine ligand and Leu77 is 5 Å. The closed ligand-bound structures of LBP provide a good basis for modeling the equivalent form of LIV. If domain 1 of LIV is superimposed on domain 1 of the LBP-leu structures, and domain 2 on its counterparts, the binding sites are seen to be extremely similar (Fig. 5). All of the hydrogen-bonding interactions that position the main chain atoms of the ligand are conserved (once the side chain of Glu226 has moved into place), and there are only two changes in residues that make direct contacts with the non-polar side chain of the ligand: Trp18 is replaced by a tyrosine and Tyr276 by phenylalanine. Comparison with Other Binding Proteins—The structure of LBP is more distantly related to those of other periplasmic binding proteins, such as the ALBP, RBP, and GBP. All three show r.m.s.d. values of ∼2 Å when the Cαs of the individual domains are compared with LBP, with approximately half of the backbone atoms matching, as expected from their 10–15% amino acid sequence identity. The domains in the LBP/LIV structures are also somewhat differently placed compared with the other binding proteins. Furthermore, the hinges of LBP and LIV are differently constructed than those of the other three proteins. In the RBP subfamily, all three connections provide direct links between the central β-sheets of the two domains. The first two are β/α crossovers, while the third is a β/β crossover. Connections I and III in LBP are β/α and β/β crossovers that link the β-sheets (although connection III is somewhat irregular); connection II is a β/α crossover that is further away from the other two hinge segments and contains an inserted helix. In ALBP, RBP, and GBP, two aspartic acid residues that are Ramachandran outliers are essential to the construction of the hinge, one placed on each side of the binding cleft. No corresponding outliers are found in the LBP or LIV structures. In all of the proteins, water molecules are found in the hinge region and are observed to be important in conformational changes. However, their location and behavior during conformational changes varies. In our LBP structures no water molecules are visible near connection II, but three are present between connection I and III. ALBP has two water molecules, one between connection I and III and one between connection II and III. Similar waters are also present in the closed form of GBP. RBP binds water in a similar manner to ALBP but here the molecule between connection I and III is lost upon closing and new bonds between the main-chains are formed. All of these differences appear to be correlated with different motions of the domains with respect to each other. The open conformation of LBP is probably stabilized only slightly by a network of hydrogen bonds linking Ser123, Thr127, and Asp330. In the case of ALBP, no new contacts between the two domains are observed in the open structures, but in RBP some new inter-domain contacts are formed, burying ∼200 Å2 of the surface area. In the open LBP structure only ∼80 Å2 is buried. The LBP structures reported here, when combined with previous structural and biochemical data, provide an unusually complete picture of the motion and function of this protein. A number of open forms are expected to exist in solution, as witnessed by the three related conformers observed for LBP and its close relative LIV. LBP, like LIV (10Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), is expected to dock ligand first to the half-site in domain 1 of any of the open forms. The ligand will at this point be correctly positioned by hydrogen bonding of the α-amino and carboxylate groups of the ligand to Ser79, Gly100, and Thr102. The hydrophobic interactions needed for the side chain of the ligand will still be largely unsatisfied, although Sack et al. (10Sack J.S. Saper M.A. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) noted earlier that the solvent-exposed area of the ligand is already decreased by 80% compared with free leucine. Upon ligand binding and closing of LBP, Trp18, Glu226, and Tyr276 must move to provide both space and correct interactions. The new LBP structures provide a good basis for understanding the ligand specificity of this protein. The α-amino and carboxylate groups of an l-amino acid are held firmly in place by hydrogen bonds to protein atoms, predominantly those of domain 1. d-Amino acids cannot be accommodated in the same way, in agreement with the experimental observation that they do not bind (4Luck L.A. Johnson C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2573-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). l-Leucine and l-phenylalanine, however, bind in a very similar manner with their side chains in the same hydrophobic pocket in the protein (Figs. 3 and 4). The larger side chain of phenylalanine forces a slight movement of Phe276, which results in more van der Waals contacts between ligand and protein. Although both ligands make hydrophobic contacts with Trp18, Tyr150, and Tyr276, phenylalanine has many more interactions with individual atoms in these residues. The additional contacts are probably part of the reason for the ∼2-fold tighter binding of phenylalanine to LBP (0.18 μm as compared with 0.40 μm for leucine (4Luck L.A. Johnson C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2573-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Adams M.D. Maguire D.J. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6209-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). 4-Fluorophenylalanine has also been observed to bind tightly to LBP (KD 0.26 μm (4Luck L.A. Johnson C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2573-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)), suggesting a similar effect. It seems possible that isoleucine could bind, as well, although this was not detected in previous tests. Valine should not bind as tightly, because its side chain will make fewer van der Waals contacts and leave a cavity at this position. The shape of methionine is also not as well suited to the shape of the site, in agreement with observations that it does not bind at all (4Luck L.A. Johnson C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2573-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The closed structures of LBP also allow a number of insights into the different specificity of LIV. The closed form of LIV was modeled in Fig. 5 by rotating the individual domains of the open structure onto their counterparts in LBP-Leu. All of the residues making hydrogen bonds to the main chain atoms of the ligand are conserved, and so leucine will be expected to bind to LIV in a very similar way. The only substantial differences between the two sites involve residues in the immediate vicinity of the ligand side chain, i.e. Trp18 of LBP is changed to to tyrosine, Gly100 to alanine, and Tyr276 to phenylalanine. Tyr18 of LIV is expected to make a hydrogen bond to His203, which will lock its conformation. Glu226 of LIV will be unable to hydrogen bond to residue 276 because of the tyrosine to phenylalanine replacement. The slightly larger Ala100 will also contribute to the shape of the binding site. Together, these changes create a different environment for the ligand side chain and so underlie the different specificity of LIV. The large side chain of phenylalanine is difficult to accommodate in LIV; is less likely to bind. The smaller side chains of isoleucine and valine have fewer steric problems and still bind LIV strongly (KD values 0.40 and 0.7 μm, respectively). However, LIV is unable to provide good hydrogen-bonding opportunities for threonine, which may account for its weaker binding compared with the isosteric side chain of valine. Serine and alanine can enter the site but will not be a good match for its size and character. Comparisons with other binding proteins in the wider family indicate that more general similarities, and differences, exist. The hinges of LBP and LIV are similarly constructed, and the observed conformations suggest that their routes for opening/closing will be similar. This is not the case for ALBP and RBP, which belong to a different structural cluster (34Tam R. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within the type 1 family of binding proteins, and have very different hinge construction. In LBP/LIV, movements of connections I and III are believed to dominate, while the changes of connection II are more passive. The known motions of the RBP/ALBP cluster are dominated by movements of connections I and II, while the movements of connection III seem to reflect attempts to adjust to motions in the other two. However, even RBP and ALBP, which have 35% amino acid sequence identity, have differences of 30–40° in the preferred directions of motion (23Björkman A.J. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones T.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14077-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The available structures clearly show that some conformational routes are highly preferred for a particular protein, but changes in water and protein structure can allow many different outcomes in the various proteins. Water molecules appear to be a particularly good way of solving the non-trivial problems of moving three neighboring hinge segments without major complications. A consistent feature within both structural clusters of this family of binding proteins is the occurrence of multiple, but related, open forms. This is apparently correlated with the fact that none of these proteins makes many inter-domain contacts that could stabilize a particular conformer. This trend is different from that found in the other major structural class of binding proteins, represented by the maltose-binding protein and lactoferrin. In these type 2 binding proteins, many contacts stabilize one particular type of open structure (35Shilton B.H. Shuman H.A. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Gerstein M. Anderson B.F. Norris G.E. Baker E.N. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In both classes of binding protein, it is believed that the open forms will be in conformational equilibrium with closed ones, even in the absence of bound ligand, i.e. that the hinge motions require very little energy. Apparently, a valid open form need not be unique, but it must: (a) allow the ligand to enter a binding site that is completely inaccessible in the closed form and (b) be sufficiently different from the closed form that competition for the membrane-bound permease is not a serious issue. Evaluations of the kinetic data for transport systems suggest that non-productive interactions of the ligand-free proteins with the permease are indeed of significance (37Shilton B.H. Mowbray S.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Bohl E. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In both classes of binding proteins, the closed forms show much less variation in the available structures. It appears that, provided the primary criteria are met, the conformational changes that link the open and closed forms of a particular binding protein can follow virtually any pattern compatible with its sequence and structure."

We report here on the identification of PTPases capable of dephosphorylating the phosphorylated immune tyrosine-based activation motifs present in the T cell receptor ζ subunit. To characterize these PTPases, we purified enzyme activities directed against the phosphorylated T cell receptor ζ subunit by a combination of anion and cation chromatography procedures.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The activation of this pathway following receptor-ligand interactions results in a transient accumulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, leading to the induction of cellular effector functions (2Weiss A.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 591-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Following TCR engagement, two tyrosine residues within each ITAM are specifically phosphorylated by the Src family of PTKs (2Weiss A. Littman D.R.

Once bi-phosphorylated, the ITAMs serve as high affinity binding sites for the ZAP-70/Syk family of PTKs, with each of two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Syk/ZAP-70 binding to one of the two phospho-tyrosine sequences (5Hatada M.H.

SHP-1 is a hematopoietic-restricted cytosolic PTPase defined by the presence of two N-terminal SH2 domains preceding a C-terminal PTPase domain. When compared with normal mice, thymocytes and peripheral T cells from mice deficient in SHP-1 contain numerous signaling proteins which are hyperphosphorylated (22Shultz L. Schweitzer P.A.

The phosphorylated ITAMs, the autophosphorylation site of the Src family kinases, and the catalytically activated forms of Syk and ZAP-70 are all considered potential SHP-1 substrates (16Brockdorff J.

Yet, several reports have shown that SHP-1 does not directly dephosphorylate the ITAMs of the TCR or B cell receptor (BCR) and the substrate specificity of SHP-1 is distinct from the highly conserved ITAM sequence (16Brockdorff J.

SHP-2 is a ubiquitously expressed PTPase that shares considerable sequence homology with SHP-1, including the presence of tandem SH2 domains. SHP-2 is generally considered a critical positive regulator of growth factor receptor signaling (29Huyer G. Alexander D. Current Biology. 1999; 9: 129-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Van Vactor D. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

In contrast to its positive regulatory effects, SHP-2 is reported to inhibit TCR signaling by dephosphorylating the 23 kDa-phosphorylated form of TCR ζ (20Lee K.-M. Chuang E. Griffin M. Khattri R.

Again, other reports have shown that SHP-2 selectively interferes with Erk activation and not with TCR ζ or ZAP-70 phosphorylation (18Frearson J.A. Alexander D.R. J. Exp.

Semin Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). CD45 is best known for its ability to directly dephosphorylate the inhibitory tyrosine residue present in the Src family PTKs, resulting in their catalytic activation (32Alexander D.R.

CD45-deficient thymocytes have substantially reduced basal and TCR-inducible levels of TCR ζ and CD3 ϵ phosphorylation, consistent with the concept that CD45 is a positive regulator of antigen receptor signaling (35Stone J.D. Conroy L.A. Byth K.F. Hederer R.A. Howlett S. Takemoto Y. Holmes N. Alexander D.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5773-5782PubMed Google Scholar). One report has shown that GST-CD45 fusion proteins containing a catalytically inactive derivative of CD45 can bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR ζ subunit, and wild-type GST-CD45 can dephosphorylate phospho-ζ (15Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10928-10932Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the dephosphorylation of the TCR ζ subunit is still apparent in certain CD45-deficient cell lines (17Chu D. Spits H. Peyron J.-F. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6251-6261Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taken together, the aforementioned reports leave unanswered which PTPases are responsible for dephosphorylating ITAMs. Approaches for identifying such PTPases involve conventional biochemical purification techniques and recent PTPase substrate trap libraries (36Tonks N.K.

We report here on a combined biochemical and substrate-trapping approach to identify all the PTPases capable of dephosphorylating and/or interacting with the TCR ζ subunit. The biochemical assays were facilitated by the development of a novel rapid ELISA-based PTPase screening assay. Using these methods, we identified PTPH1 as a predominant PTPase capable of directly interacting with and dephosphorylating TCR ζ. Cell Lines, cDNAs, and Antibodies—The Jurkat T cell line (E6.1) was kindly provided by Dr. Arthur Weiss (UCSF) while the COS7, Raji (EBV-transformed B cell line), and J45 (CD45-deficient Jurkat derivative) cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Sf9 and Sf21 insect cell lines were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). mAbs versus SHP-1 and SHP-2 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), anti-CD45, and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and anti-TCR ζ (6B10.2) has been previously described (39van Oers N.S.C. von Boehmer H.

Rabbit antiphospho-Src (pY418, active form of kinase) was obtained from BIOSOURCE (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). Dr. Nick Tonks (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) very kindly provided both the cDNA for human PTPH1 and a mAb against human PTPH1. We subsequently generated a mAb against PTPH1 (4G1, IgG1) using full-length PTPH1 as the immunogen. This mAb can be used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Murine SHP-1 and SHP-2 cDNAs were prepared using standard RT-PCR procedures with thymus RNA. Following sequence verification, the cDNAs were subcloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transfected into COS7 cells as described elsewhere (8van Oers N.S.C. Tohlen B. Malissen B.

Phosphorylated TCR ζ Substrate Preparation—The cytoplasmic domain of the TCR ζ subunit containing all three ITAMs was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, the cytoplasmic domain of ζ was directly purified from Sf21 insect cell lysates using anti-TCR ζ affinity chromatography columns. For these preparations, the cytoplasmic region of ζ was subcloned into pFASTBac, which was then used to transform Max Efficiency DH10Bac™ competent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). BacMid DNA was isolated and used to transfect Sf9 insect cells with Cell-FECTIN™ (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). Virus was isolated 72 h post-infection and a large titer viral stock was used to infect Sf21 insect cells. Seventy-two hours later, Sf21 lysates were prepared, cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to an anti-TCR ζ affinity column as described in detail elsewhere (8van Oers N.S.C. Tohlen B. Malissen B. Moomaw C.R. Afendis S. Slaughter C. Nat. Immunology. 2000; 1: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Preparations of ζ were tyrosine-phosphorylated with the c-Src protein-tyrosine kinase under conditions described elsewhere (c-Src was kindly provided by Dr. David Morgan, University of California, San Francisco) (40Watts J.D. Wilson G.M. Ettehadieh E. Clark-Lewis I. Kubanek C.-A. Astell C.R. Marth J.D. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 901-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Morgan D.O. Kaplan J.M.

Although 13 tyrosine residues are present in GST, we were unable to detect any phosphorylation of GST alone using c-Src (data not shown). For determining the specific enzymatic activity of the PTPase, 100 μl of GST-ζ beads (1–2.5 mg/ml) were washed four times in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and subsequently washed six times in kinase buffer. The kinase buffer consisted of 32.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.60 containing 6.25 mm MnCl2, 0.0625% Triton X-100, and supplemented with 2 mm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine. The beads were pelleted and resuspended in 500 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.4 mm ATP (final) and 10 μl of [γ-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences or ICN). 4 μl of c-Src (0.25 mg/ml) was added, and the kinase reaction was terminated after 5 h at 30 °C. The beads were washed six times in lysis buffer, and the 32P-labeled GST-ζ protein was eluted off the beads in 10 mm glutathione. The purified phosphorylated ζ molecule was buffer-exchanged into a PTPase assay buffer with PD-10 desalting columns. Removing an aliquot of the kinase mixture at the initiation of the reaction, and calculating the cpm/nmol of phosphate released gives the specific activity according to Equation 1. cpmofaliquot×totalvol(500μl)(200nmolofphosphate)(Eq. 1) Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Assays—The PTPase assays were performed in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.60 containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaF, and 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors. For quantitative assays, 10 μl of [32P]GST-ζ substrate was added, and a kinetic assay was performed from 1–10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid followed by 50 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin (carrier protein). The amount of 32P remaining in the supernatant was measured in a scintillation counter and the mol of phosphate released per minute were calculated based on the specific activity of the substrate. Protein amounts were determined with a Lowry-based protein assay. ELISA-based Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase Assay—A 96-well plate (CoStar) was coated overnight with GST-ζ-PO4 at a 1:200 dilution (50 μl/well at 2 μg/ml) in a 0.2 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.10 buffer supplemented with sodium orthovanadate and sodium azide. The plate was washed four times with a Tris-buffered salt solution containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and then blocked for an hour with 300 μl of 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST. The bovine serum albumin was rinsed from the plate with two TBST washes followed by two washes in a PTPase assay buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0; 2 mm EDTA; 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol; 2 mm NaF, protease inhibitors). 100 μl of the assay buffer plus 20 μl of each fraction were added to the individual wells and agitated for 30 min at 37 °C. The plate was subsequently washed four times with TBST. One hundred microliters of anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, 1 μg/ml) was added for 30 min. The amount of anti-phosphotyrosine mAb bound was determined with standard ELISA assays. Chromatographic Separations—Buffer A: 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.60, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mg/liter CaCl2, 5 mg/liter MgCl2. Buffer B: 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.60, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Buffer C: Buffer B plus 1 m NaCl. Buffer D: 50 mm MES, pH 6.60, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Buffer E: Buffer D containing 1 m NaCl. Buffer F: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.60, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Unless otherwise indicated, all buffers were supplemented with aprotinin (1 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin, 5 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm sodium fluoride. For initial cellular preparations, between 1 and 5 × 109 Jurkat T-cells were washed three times in Buffer A or phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer B and left on ice for 15 min. The cells were then dounce-homogenized with 20–30 strokes, left on ice for an additional 20 min and subsequently ultracentrifuged for 2 h (60,000 × g) at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter containing a glass fiber pre-filter (Serum Acrodisc, Gelman Biosciences), and the sample was applied to a 2.5 × 30-cm anion-exchange column linked to an FPLC™ system (Q-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences). Proteins retained on the column were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (Buffer C) at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. 10-ml fractions were collected. Each fraction was tested for activity against the TCR-ζ chain using the 32P-labeled GST-ζ protein or the ELISA-based assay. We initially performed a kinetic analysis and a dose response curve to determine the linear range of phosphate release. For assaying the individual fractions, 10-μl aliquots were incubated with the GST-ζ-32PO4 for 1 min, and the specific activity was calculated. The two active regions were combined from two separate anion-exchange runs, concentrated and buffer-exchanged with Buffer D through the use of a Centricon-Plus 20 filter (30,000 Da exclusion membrane, Millipore Corp.). The eluate and retentate were both tested for PTPase activity and the retentate (greater than 30 kDa) was always found to contain the activity. The buffer-exchanged retentate was applied to a cation-exchange column linked to an FPLC-system (5 ml HiTrap™ SP, Amersham Biosciences). Proteins retained on the columns were eluted with a linear salt gradient (NaCl) in Buffer E. Each fraction was tested for PTPase activity against phospho-ζ. The active fractions from the cation exchange runs were concentrated and buffer exchanged back to buffer B using centricon-30 centrifugal filters. Mass Spectrometry—The highly purified PTPase-active regions were trypsin-digested and subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis on an LCQ-DECA ion trap mass spectrometer from Finnigan (San Jose, CA) equipped with an on-line capillary HPLC system from Waters (Milford, MA). Dot-blot Trapping—The catalytic domain of 47 distinct PTPases (56 putative PTPases in the human genome) were subcloned into pGEX-4T3 and Asp to Ala point mutations were introduced in each PTPase as previously described (Table V) (38Wälchli S.

We attempted to identify the PTPases in Jurkat T cells capable of dephosphorylating the TCR ζ subunit. A Jurkat T cell homogenate was prepared, and the supernatant was obtained following ultracentrifugation. This preparation was assayed for phosphatase activity with a phospho-GST-ζ fusion protein substrate. The tyrosine residues in the ITAMs of the GST-ζ protein had been phosphorylated with the c-Src PTK. A fraction of the Jurkat supernatant (10 μg of total protein) was incubated with phospho-ζ for the indicated time points (Fig. 1a). The substrate was dephosphorylated within a 3–10 min incubation period (Fig. 1a). This activity was almost completely inhibited when either of two PTPase inhibitors, sodium molybdate or sodium orthovanadate, were included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1a, lanes 7 and 8). Using a 32P-radiolabeled GST-ζ substrate, we determined that Jurkat T cell homogenates contained a specific enzymatic activity of 0.24 pmol/min/microgram (Table I). To confirm further that the dephosphorylation reflected tyrosine phosphatase activities, the assays were repeated in the presence of several tyrosine-, serine/threonine-, and acid-phosphatase inhibitors. The PT-Pase-specific inhibitors, sodium orthovanadate, and sodium molybdate, were the only inhibitors that specifically blocked 70–100% of the enzyme activity (Fig. 1a and Table II). Although the phosphorylated GST-ζ fusion protein was readily dephosphorylated, it was difficult to determine whether the GST domain influenced the PTPase activity. Given this issue, the PTPase assays were also performed with a purified TCR ζ molecule that had been expressed as a cytosolic protein in Sf21 insect cells. Upon phosphorylation, this substrate appears as a heterogeneous mixture of phosphorylated intermediates, with all six tyrosines used as phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1b, lane 1) (8van Oers N.S.C.

An aliquot of the Jurkat homogenate completely dephosphorylated this substrate within a 3-min incubation period, with no preferential site of dephosphorylation evident (Fig. 1b, lanes 3–6). Again, the enzyme activity was inhibited by the PTPase inhibitor sodium molybdate and/or sodium orthovanadate (lanes 7–8).Table IPTPase activities isolated from different cell lines against the tyrosine-phosphorylated TCR ζ subunitCell lineaThe indicated cells were processed by Dounce homogenization, and the resulting supernantant following an u"

Although these toxins have been instrumental in the study of channel gating and architecture, little is known about their active sites. By using an efficient system for the production of recombinant toxins, we analyzed by point mutagenesis the entire surface of the β-toxin, Bj-xtrIT, an anti-insect selective excitatory toxin from the scorpion Buthotus judaicus. Each toxin mutant was purified and analyzed using toxicity and binding assays, as well as by circular dichroism spectroscopy to discern the differences among mutations that caused structural changes and those that specifically affected bioactivity. This analysis highlighted a functional discontinuous surface of 1405 Å2, which was composed of a number of non-polar and three charged amino acids clustered around the main α-helical motif and the C-tail. Among the charged residues, Glu30 is a center of a putative “hot spot” in the toxin-receptor binding-interface and is shielded from bulk solvent by a hydrophobic “gasket” (Tyr26 and Val34). Comparison of the Bj-xtrIT structure with that of other β-toxins that are active on mammals suggests that the hot spot and an adjacent non-polar region are spatially conserved. These results highlight for the first time structural elements that constitute a putative “pharmacophore” involved in the interaction of β-toxins with receptor site-4 on NaChs. Furthermore, the unique structure of the C-terminal region most likely determines the specificity of excitatory toxins for insect NaChs.

Scorpion toxins that modify the gating of voltage-sensitive sodium channels (NaChs) 1The abbreviations used are: NaChs, sodium channels; Aah, Androctonus australis hector; Lqh, Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus. are divided into α and β classes according to their modes of action and binding properties to distinct receptor sites (1Jover E.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). α-Toxins affect channel inactivation upon binding to receptor site-3, whereas β-toxins modulate the activation properties of the channel when interacting with receptor site-4 (3Catterall W.A. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: S15-S48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among β-toxins, two distinct groups, the excitatory (e.g. AahIT from Androctonus australis hector, Aah) and the depressant (e.g. LqhIT2 from Leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus, Lqh), show specificity for insects (4Zlotkin E. Lazarovici P. Gutman Y. Toxins and Signal Transduction. Harwood Press, Amsterdam1997: 95-117Google Scholar). Despite different symptoms in blowfly larvae and effects on the sodium current induced by excitatory and depressant toxins, they compete with one another on binding to cockroach NaChs (5Moskowitz H.

The core structure of Bj-xtrIT is very similar to those of other “long chain” scorpion toxins active on NaChs (α-helix packed against a three-stranded β-sheet stabilized by three spatially conserved disulfide bonds; Fig. 1), but varies prominently in the spatial arrangement of its forth disulfide bond (Fig. 1; Refs. 29Oren D.A.

Moreover, the C-terminal region of Bj-xtrIT (residues 60-76), and most likely that of all excitatory toxins, contains an additional unique α-helix, α2 (residues 63-69 in Bj-xtrIT; Ref. 29Oren D.A.

Biol. 1982; 97: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar, 23Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov M. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E. Oren D.A. Shaanan B. Gurevitz M. J. Biol.

Here we provide the first detailed report of the entire functional surface of a scorpion β-toxin, Bj-xtrIT, which affects specifically insect NaChs. The functional surface is composed of a region surrounding a putative “hot spot” and the C-tail that most likely provides the specificity for insects. A negatively charged hot spot residue (Glu30 in Bj-xtrIT) adjacent to a non-polar cluster appears in all β-toxins, suggesting that they constitute the “pharmacophore” of toxins that bind to receptor site-4 on various NaChs. Bacterial Strains—Escherichia coli DH5α cells were used for plasmid constructions, and the BL21 strain for toxin expression using the pET-11c vector was as described (23Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov M. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E. Oren D.A. Shaanan B. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5769-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Toxicity Assays—Four-day-old blowfly larvae (Sarcophaga falculata; 150 ± 20-mg body weight) were injected inter-segmentally. A positive result was scored when a characteristic paralysis (immobilization and contraction) was observed up to 5 min after injection. Five concentrations of each toxin were injected to larvae (nine larvae in each group) in three independent experiments. ED50 (effective dose 50%) values were calculated according to the sampling and estimation method of Reed and Muench (31Reed L.J. Muench H. Am. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Binding Studies—Insect synaptosomes were prepared from whole heads of adult cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) according to a method described previously (32Krimm I. Gilles N. Sautiere P. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Gordon D. Lancelin J.-M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1749-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bj-xtrIT was radioiodinated by iodogen using 5 μg of toxin and 0.5 mCi of carrier-free Na125I. Concentration of labeled monoiodotoxin was determined according to the specific activity of 125I (2500-3000 dpm/fmol; Refs. 33Gilles N. Gurevitz M. Gordon D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Gilles N. Krimm I. Bouet F. Froy D. Gurevitz M. Lancelin J.M. Gordon D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Toxin binding assays were performed as was described in detail previously (11Lima M.E. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Hue B. Loret E. Diniz C.R. Rochat H. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 413-422Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound toxin was separated from the free radio-ligand by rapid filtration (under vacuum) through glass-fiber filters (GF/C Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Hot saturation assays were performed using increasing concentrations of the radio-labeled toxin, with a constant amount of membranes. Data were analyzed using the iterative program LIGAND (Elsevier Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) using “Hot Saturation” analysis. Equilibrium competition binding experiments were carried out with increasing concentrations of the unlabeled toxin in the presence of a constant low concentration of the radioactive toxin. Competition experiments were analyzed by KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software version 3.08) using a non-linear fit to the Hill equation (34Gilles N. Krimm I. Bouet F. Froy D. Gurevitz M. Lancelin J.M. Gordon D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for determination of the inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50). Ki values were calculated by the equation Ki = IC50/1 + [L*/Kd], where L* is the radioactive ligand concentration and Kd is its dissociation constant. Each experiment was performed at least three times, and each data point represents the mean of two to three samples (with up to 12% deviation between samples). Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of a number (n) of independent experiments. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C using a model 202 circular dichroism spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments, Lakewood, NJ). Toxins (140 μm) were dissolved in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and their spectra (190-260 nm) were measured three times using a 0.1-mm path length quartz cuvette. Blank spectrum of the buffer was run under identical conditions and subtracted from each toxin spectrum. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Production of Recombinant Toxin Variants—Expression of Bj-xtrIT has been described (23Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov M. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E. Oren D.A. Shaanan B. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5769-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mutations in the toxin were generated by PCR using complementary oligonucleotide primers (purchased from Sigma) with the expression vectors as DNA templates (23Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov M. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E. Oren D.A. Shaanan B. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5769-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Toxin mutants were produced similarly to the unmodified toxins. Sequences were verified prior to expression. Quantification of purified recombinant toxins was performed by amino acid analysis using an ABI system 420A/130A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) after hydrolysis by 6 m HCl under vacuum (18 h at 110 °C). Three-dimensional Models and CSU Analysis—Three-dimensional models of Bj-xtrIT were constructed according to the crystal structure (Protein Data Bank accession no. 1BCG) using the Swiss Model Homology Modeling server and the Swiss-PDB Viewer program. Intra-molecular Contacts of Structural Units (CSU) were obtained using the CSU software (35Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Bj-xtrIT binds with high affinity (Kd = 0.148 ± 0.032 nm, n = 4) to a single site on NaChs in cockroach neuronal membranes (Fig. 2A, inset). This site is also recognized by other anti-insect excitatory (e.g. AahIT) and depressant (e.g. LqhIT2) toxins (23Froy O. Zilberberg N. Gordon D. Turkov M. Gilles N. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Loret E. Oren D.A. Shaanan B. Gurevitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5769-5776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and by a β-toxin (Lqhβ1) active on both insects and mammals (11Lima M.E. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Hue B. Loret E. Diniz C.R. Rochat H. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 413-422Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To elucidate the entire functional surface of Bj-xtrIT, we mutagenized all solvent-exposed residues (Fig. 1C). Each mutant was produced in a recombinant form and analyzed for toxicity to fly larvae and binding properties on cockroach neuronal membranes. These assays were accompanied by CD spectroscopy to discern between effects resulting from putative structural perturbation and those reflecting putative interaction with the channel receptor. Overall, the changes in toxicity reflected the changes in binding affinity, and the CD spectra of most mutants were indistinguishable from that of the unmodified toxin. Residues whose substitution decreased substantially the toxicity (ED50 mutant/ED50 wild-type > 10) and binding affinity (Ki mutant/Ki wild-type > 30) with no alteration of the CD spectrum were considered significant for activity and assigned to the putative functional surface. Residues whose substitution reduced the activity but also altered the CD spectrum (S29A, W44E, Y68A/L) were excluded from the functional surface. Mutagenesis of Residues in the N-terminal Region and the Loop Preceding α1—The N-terminal region (residues 1-15) of Bj-xtrIT and other excitatory toxins is rich in charged residues, several of which are involved in intra-molecular hydrogen bonds (29Oren D.A. Froy O. Amit E. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gurevitz M. Shaanan B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1095-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Substitution of residues in this region had minor effects on activity, except for Glu15 (Fig. 2A; Table I). Mutations E15Q (charge neutralization) and E15D (shorter side-chain) reduced the binding affinity over 100-fold (Fig. 2, A and B; Table I). In contrast, almost all substitutions in the region composed of residues 17-24 (precedes α1 and includes α0) affected toxin activity (Fig. 2A). Mutations V19A, N20A, I22A, P24A, and P24G, but not S17A or A21G (smaller side-chain) significantly decreased the activity (Table I; Fig. 2A). Increase in side-chain size at positions 19 (V19W), 23 (A23V), and 20 (N20Q or N20W), but not 21 (A21V) and 22 (I22L, I22F, or I22W), decreased the activity (Table I). These results suggest that the solvent-exposed region preceding α1 may be part of the interacting surface of Bj-xtrIT with its receptor site.Table IEffects of mutations on the energy of Bj-xtrIT binding to cockroach sodium channelsBj-xtrIT mutantΔΔGBj-xtrIT mutantΔΔGkcal/molkcal/molE15Q2.84Y26A0.70E15D3.05Y26W4.06V19A2.06E30Q2.55V19L1.48E30D2.24V19W2.56E30R5.53N20A3.61V34S2.73N20W3.65V34W5.74N20Q4.26W44A1.22A21G1.98W44L0.90A21V1.03I64A2.32I22A2.59V71A2.71I22L1.33Q72A4.25I22F0.86I73A4.06I22W0.05I73E5.17A23G3.56I73F2.32A23V1.79I74A2.76P24G2.93I74F1.72P24A3.24I74L1.77H25A3.91I74V2.11H25N2.86 Open table in a new tab Modification of Amino Acid Residues in α1—Among the ten amino acids encompassing α1 (positions 25-34), substitution of four residues (His25, Tyr26, Glu30, Val34) reduced the activity (Fig. 2; Table I). The importance of the hydrophobic moiety and the charge of His25 for function were demonstrated by the decreased activity of mutants H25A and H25N (Table I) but not H25R (not shown). Neutralization of the negatively charged side-chain of Glu30 (E30Q) reduced the binding affinity 75-fold, suggesting a functional role for this residue. A conserved substitution (E30D) also had an effect (Table I), thus emphasizing the importance of side-chain length at this position. The most prominent effect on activity was obtained upon charge inversion (mutation E30R), which practically abolished the activity (Table I; Fig. 2). These results suggest that Glu30 may interact with a positively charged residue of the receptor site. Because the side-chains of Tyr26 and Val34 project to the solvent in the same plane as that of Glu30 (29Oren D.A. Froy O. Amit E. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gurevitz M. Shaanan B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1095-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we examined their role in toxin function. Substitution of both residues by Ala had little effect on toxicity (not shown), whereas increase in side-chain size (Y26W or V34W) decreased the binding affinity 950- and 16,300-fold, respectively (Table I). We further examined the importance of the chemical nature of Val34 by its substitution with a polar residue of a similar size (V34S). The substantial effect on activity of this mutation together with the above results suggest that a hydrophobic side-chain of limited size is important at this position for toxin function. These results imply that Glu30 flanked by Tyr26 and Val34 may be part of the putative contact surface of the toxin with its receptor site. Modifications in Other Loops and the C-terminal Region—We mutagenized most of the solvent-exposed charged and hydrophobic residues in the loops encompassing amino acids 35-62 (Fig. 1, A and C). Mutations Y35A, Y35W, Y36A, E38I, E53A, D54A, D55A, K56T, K56A/P60S, and K62A had small effects on toxin activity (Fig. 2; Table I). Similarly, mutations D63N, K66A, and K67A at the C-terminal α2 motif (Fig. 1) had minor effects on activity (Fig. 2). Tyr68 is conserved in excitatory toxins (Fig. 1A) and may interact with Ile64 (3.2 Å in distance) and with Trp44 (4.4 Å in distance; Ref. 29Oren D.A. Froy O. Amit E. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gurevitz M. Shaanan B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1095-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A Y68W mutation, which maintained the aromatic nature at this position, had no effect on toxin function (not shown), whereas substitutions to Ala or Leu were detrimental to both the structure (alteration of CD) and activity (not shown). Substitutions W44A and W44L (Leu is found in other excitatory toxins; Fig. 1A) had only little effect on activity (Table I), presumably because the hydrophobic interaction with Tyr68 was retained. Mutation I64A decreased the binding affinity 50-fold (Table I), thus endorsing the putative importance of its interaction with Tyr68. On the basis of these results, residues 64 and 68 were not assigned to the functional surface. Previously, we have shown that deletion of C-terminal residues (Asp70-Ser76) abolished the activity of Bj-xtrIT, whereas deletion of the two terminal residues Pro75 and Ser76 (mutant ΔPro75-Ser76) had no effect (29Oren D.A. Froy O. Amit E. Kleinberger-Doron N. Gurevitz M. Shaanan B. Structure. 1998; 6: 1095-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To better specify the residues that are important for activity in this region, all C-tail residues were analyzed. A D70A mutation had only a minor effect, whereas V71A, Q72A, I73A, and I74A affected significantly the activity of Bj-xtrIT (Table I; Fig. 2). Substitution of Ile73 to Phe and Ile74 to Val, Leu, or Phe had a smaller effect on activity compared with the Ala mutants (Table I). These results suggest that the side-chain length of these residues is important for toxin function. Furthermore, insertion of a negative charge at the C-tail (mutant I73E) was detrimental (6900-fold decrease in binding affinity; Table I). These results suggest that the overall hydrophobic nature of the C-terminal region is important for the activity of Bj-xtrIT. Molecular dissection of Bj-xtrIT illuminates a discontinuous functional surface (1405 Å2) composed of amino acid residues of the α1 helical motif, its preceding loop, the C-terminal region, and Glu15. Although the loop preceding α1 is unique to Bj-xtrIT and is shorter in other excitatory toxins (Fig. 1), this non-polar cluster seems to be part of the contact surface with the receptor site (Table I; Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to previous suggestions that positively charged residues have a mandatory role in the activity of scorpion β-toxins (19Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 36Selisko B. Garcia C. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Possani L.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Pinheiro C.B. Marangoni S. Toyama M.H. Polikarpov I. Acta Cryst. 2003; D59: 405-415Google Scholar), the only positively charged residue with a functional role in Bj-xtrIT is His25. Because His25 is not conserved in excitatory toxins or other β-toxins (Fig. 1), the role of the residue at this position in other toxins deserves further investigation. Notably, two negatively charged residues (Glu15 and Glu30) play a critical role in Bj-xtrIT activity. Glu15, whose side-chain projects to the solvent, is conserved in excitatory toxins, and is distant from all other residues involved in function (12 Å from Glu30 and 13 Å from His25; Fig. 3). Glu30 is conserved in the α-helix of all β-toxins, and its substitution to Arg (E30R) had the most detrimental effect on toxin activity. A recent survey on protein-protein binding interfaces reveals that the free energy of binding is mostly concentrated in hot spots formed by a small number of residues (38Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). At these hot spots, the high-energy interactions are protected from bulk solvent by surrounding residues that form a shielding “gasket.” Substitution of the gasket residues to Ala has been found in many cases to have little effect on the binding energy, implying that the Ala side-chain and protein backbone are sufficient to occlude solvent from the hot spot. Conversely, substitution by Trp may disrupt the contact surface and hence the shield, leading to a marked decrease in binding affinity (38Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The mutagenesis results of Tyr26, Val34, and Glu30 fit well with this scenario and suggest that Glu30 serves as a point of high-energy interaction with the receptor. The reduced binding energy of E30Q and E30R (ΔΔG = 2.55 and 5.53 kcal/mol, respectively) compared with the smaller effect obtained with E30D (ΔΔG = 2.24 kcal/mol) indicates that the negatively charged Glu30 most likely interacts electrostatically with a positively charged receptor counterpart. The little effect obtained upon Y26A and V34A substitutions and the prominent effect produced by the Y26W and V34W mutations (Table I) suggest that these residues participate in the gasket that shields the electrostatic interaction of Glu30 with the receptor site. This suggestion is corroborated by the reduced activity obtained upon a V34S substitution, introducing a polar side-chain that presumably disrupts the hydrophobic seal around Glu30 (Fig. 3; Table I; Ref. 38Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Although receptor site-4 of insect and mammalian NaChs has been shown to involve domain 2 (17Shichor I. Zlotkin E. Ilan N. Chikashvili D. Stuhmer W. Gordon D. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4364-4371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marcotte P. Chen L.-Q. Kallen R.G. Chahine M. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 19Cestèle S. Qu Y. Rogers J.C. Rochat H. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 919-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the composition and topology of this receptor are still elusive. Assuming that the receptor site reflects, at least to some extent, the mirror face of the functional surface of the toxin, it is conceivable that it is comprised of a solvent-exposed non-polar region, which interacts with the two hydrophobic clusters in the functional surface of Bj-xtrIT. A positively charged residue, which interacts with high binding energy with Glu30 of the toxin, seems most likely to be within this non-polar region. The marked decrease in activity of mutant E30R may reflect ionic repulsion between Arg30 of the toxin mutant and the presumable positive charge in the receptor. An additional positively charged channel residue that interacts with Glu15 of the toxin is anticipated ∼12 Å from the hot spot residue. Elucidation of the putative receptor site still awaits mutagenesis of outer NaCh regions and will undoubtedly be the focus of future studies. Commonality in the Putative Functional Surface of β-Toxins—Although the β-toxins, Cn2 and Ts1, which are active on mammals (39Possani L.D. Becerril B. Delepierre M. Tytgat J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), share only 33 and 36% sequence similarity with Bj-xtrIT (Fig. 1A), they all compete for binding to insect NaChs 2N.

Acta Cryst. 2003; D59: 405-415Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession no. 1NPI) reveals a close fit of their carbon backbone, which diverges toward the C-terminal region (Ile58 in Bj-xtrIT; Val57 in Cn2; Val53 in Ts1; Fig. 3D; Ref. 30Gurevitz M. Gordon D. Ben-Natan S. Turkov M. Froy O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1201-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the spatial arrangement of Glu30 (Glu28 in Cn2 and Glu26 in Ts1), with its flanking hydrophobic residues (Tyr26 and Val34 in Bj-xtrIT), is very similar in Cn2 (Tyr24 and Gln32) and Ts1 (Tyr22 and Ile29). This similarity suggests that a Glu residue in the center of a putative hot spot is conserved in the α-helix of all β-toxins (Fig. 3D). Additional regions important for Bj-xtrIT function also show similarities to their corresponding regions in other β-toxins. The loop preceding the α-helix of Cn2 and Ts1 contains solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues (Leu17 and Leu19 in Cn2; Phe16 and Ile17 in Ts1) similarly to the corresponding region in Bj-xtrIT (Val19, Ile22, Ala23, and Pro24). The resemblance of the three toxins is further accentuated by intra-molecular contacts that stabilize the loop preceding the α-helix, Asn20 with Tyr26 (3.2 Å in distance) in Bj-xtrIT, Leu17 with Tyr24 (3.9 Å in distance) in Cn2, and Lys18 with Tyr22 (3.6 Å in distance) in Ts1. In summary, the striking similarity in the spatial arrangement of a Glu residue surrounded by a solvent-occluding gasket adjacent to a cluster of non-polar residues suggests that this region of the functional surface constitutes the pharmacophore in β-toxins. This common feature may explain the ability of distinct β-toxins to compete with one another on binding to NaChs. Still, despite similar structural arrangement of the putative functional region in various β-toxins, position 15 is not conserved in certain β-toxins active on insect NaChs (i.e. Ts1, the depressant toxin LqhIT2, and Lqhβ1; Fig 1A; Refs. 15Gordon D. Ilan N. Zilberberg N. Gilles N. Urbach D. Cohen L. Karbat I. Froy O. Gaathon A. Kallen R.G. Benveniste M. Gurevitz M. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This suggests that despite the commonality, some β-toxins bind to receptor site-4 differently. In addition, the uniqueness of the C-terminal region, which is not conserved in other β-toxins, may explain the specificity of Bj-xtrIT and other excitatory toxins to insects. Elucidation of functional surfaces of other β-toxins as well as delineating their interacting domains on NaChs may unravel the mechanism by which these toxins modulate NaCh function. These data may be instrumental in the design of novel drugs and insecticides. We thank Dr. L. Possani for his kind gift of the Cn2 toxin."

The objective of this study is to better understand the sequence of events that occurs during repair from the time RNA polymerase II first encounters the lesion. This study establishes that an immobilized DNA template containing a unique cisplatin lesion can serve as an in vitro substrate for both transcription and DNA repair. RNA polymerase II is quantitatively stalled at the cisplatin lesion during transcription and can be released from the template, along with the nascent transcript, in an ATP-dependent manner. RNA polymerase II stalled at a lesion and containing a dephosphorylated repetitive carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) appears to be more sensitive toward release. However, a dephosphorylated CTD can become readily phosphorylated in front of the lesion by CTD kinases in the presence of ATP. The observation that RNA polymerase II and transcript release occurs in a TFIIH-deficient repair extract but not in a reconstituted repair system demonstrates that disassembly of the elongation complex can occur independently of the repair process and vice versa. Indeed, the presence of RNA polymerase II at the lesion does not prevent dual incision from occurring. Finally, we also propose that the Cockayne's syndrome B protein factor, believed to be the mammalian transcription repair coupling factor, is neither involved in transcript release nor required for dual incision in the presence of lesionstalled RNA polymerase II in vitro.

Well-established repair mechanisms to remove such lesions and maintain genome integrity include nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; RPA, replication protein A; TFIIH, transcription factor IIH; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; TCR, transcription coupled repair; TRCF, transcription repair coupling factor; CSB, Cockayne's syndrome B protein; RIS, reconstituted incision system; WCE, whole cell extract; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain. which operates on bulky helix-distorting damage caused by a variety of mutagens including UV light and certain drugs (1Friedberg E.C. Nature. 2003; 421: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). During NER, the damage-containing oligonucleotide is first eliminated from the DNA in the dual incision step. This step requires the concerted action of various NER factors including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group C (XPC) protein complex (XPC-HR23B), transcription factor IIH (TFIIH, a general transcription factor for RNA polymerase II), xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA), replication protein A (RPA), XPG, and XPF-ERCC1. The gapped DNA structure is then filled by a resynthesis machinery consisting of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, RPA, polymerase δ/ϵ, and DNA ligase I (2Lindahl T. Karran P. Wood R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 158-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Mutations in genes encoding NER proteins give rise to three human genetic disorders, thereby demonstrating the importance of this pathway. These disorders include xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne's syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy (3Berneburg M. Lehmann A.R. Adv. Genet. 2001; 43: 71-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA lesions located in the transcribed DNA strand potentially block the progression of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and are therefore deleterious to the cell. Such lesions can be repaired by a specialized NER pathway designated transcription-coupled repair (TCR) (4Svejstrup J.Q. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The damage removal by TCR in actively transcribed genes is more efficient than the removal of damage located elsewhere in the genome (5Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). TCR is conserved from bacteria (6Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) to humans (5Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TCR is relatively well understood in Escherichia coli, where a transcription repair coupling factor (TRCF) displaces stalled RNA polymerase and simultaneously recruits the repair machinery to the site of damage (7Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4882-4889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite 16 years of studies, the mechanism of TCR in human cells is poorly understood. A eukaryotic RNAP II blocked at a site of DNA damage is thought to trigger the recruitment of the repair machinery (8Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Cockayne's syndrome B protein (CSB), the putative mammalian TRCF that was found in ternary complexes containing the lesion-blocked RNAP II (Ref. 9Tantin D. Kansal A. Carey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar and this study), does not disrupt these stalled complexes by itself (10Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Whether or not CSB acts as a relay between the transcription and the repair machineries is yet to be determined. The fate of RNAP II with respect to its potential removal, displacement, or conformational change before, during, or after repair is not known (11Svejstrup J.Q. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12van den Boom V. Jaspers N.G. Vermeulen W. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transcription complexes stalled at a site of UV DNA damage such as thymine dimers has been widely studied (13Hara R. Selby C.P. Liu M. Price D.H. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19558-19564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Studies presented here focus on another type of lesion repaired by NER/TCR: cisplatin cross-links (16May A. Nairn R.S. Okumoto D.S. Wassermann K. Stevnsner T. Jones J.C. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1650-1657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhen W. Evans M.K. Haggerty C.M. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cisplatin derivatives are frequently used in chemotherapy and produce different kinds of adducts including: 1,2- and 1,3-intrastrand cross-links between adjacent purines, interstrand adducts, and monoadducts (18Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The present study uses the 1,3-intrastrand adduct that has been shown to be a block to RNAP II transcription (19Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Tornaletti S. Patrick S.M. Turchi J.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35791-35797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In an attempt to better understand the early steps of the TCR process, we developed an in vitro transcription system in which a DNA template, containing a site-specific cisplatin lesion, has been immobilized on paramagnetic beads. This system allows early elongation complexes paused near the transcriptional start site to be chased to the site of the lesion and the fate of RNAP II to be determined (21Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This study first shows that an immobilized DNA template containing a unique cisplatin at a specific site can be used in both DNA repair and transcription assays in which elongating RNAP II becomes completely blocked by the lesion. Because of knowing that a cell-free extract can destabilize RNAP II stalled on a thymine dimer (22Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), it was of interest to establish and to characterize the stability of ternary complexes stalled at a cisplatin lesion. Using a repair-deficient extract containing mutated TFIIH, along with a reconstituted incision system (RIS) consisting of the highly purified XPC-HR23B, TFIIH, XPA, RPA, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1 NER factors, the destabilization of transcription complexes stalled at a cisplatin lesion was shown to be ATP dependent but not repair dependent. Furthermore, use of the RIS confirms that RNAP II stalled on a cisplatin lesion does not inhibit onset of the repair reaction. Moreover, dual incision can occur without the removal of RNAP II from the lesion, whereas the mammalian TRCF, CSB, acts by preventing RNAP II from backing up in front of the lesion, a reaction likely dependent on TFIIS (23Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our results support a model in which TCR is initiated in the presence of damaged stalled RNAP II, or alternatively, the damaged template can be cleared from RNAP II in the absence of repair by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Oligonucleotide Containing a Defined 1,3-Intrastrand Platinum Cross-link—Activated cisplatin was generated by incubating a 10 mm solution of cis-platinum(II) diamminedichloride (Sigma) in N,N-dimethylformamide with a 2-fold molar excess of AgNO3 at 37 °C overnight in the dark. The G-residues within the 5′-TCTCTTCTTCTGTGCACTTCTTCCT-3′ oligonucleotide (shown in bold for clarity) were intrastrand cross-linked by incubating 5 nmol of the oligonucleotide with 4 nmol of activated cisplatin for 40 min at 37 °C in 300 μl buffer containing 10 mm NaClO4, 5 mm AcOH (pH 3.5). Oligonucleotides with a 1,3-intrastrand platin cross-link were then chromatographically purified by absorption to a Mono Q ion exchange column (Pharmacia), followed by elution with a 10 mm to 1 m NaCl gradient in the presence of 10 mm NaOH. Fractions containing the cisplatinated oligonucleotide were desalted by reverse-phase chromatography (C18 sapPak, Waters), and the cross-linked oligonucleotide was recovered by solvent evaporation and reconstitution in water. Preparation of Immobilized Damaged DNA Template—Covalently closed circular DNA containing a single 1,3-intrastrand cisplatin cross-link was prepared as described previously (24Shivji M.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Methods Mol.Biol. 1999; 113: 373-392PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cisplatinated oligonucleotide was annealed to a single-strand DNA derived from the 105.TS plasmid (19Frit P. Kwon K. Coin F. Auriol J. Dubaele S. Salles B. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1391-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and extended by a T7 DNA polymerase reaction. The newly synthesized strand was then sealed by T4 DNA ligase. Closed circular DNA was isolated by CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation, extracted with butanol, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA. The resulting plasmid contained the Adenovirus major late promoter and a single 1,3-intrastrand cisplatin cross-link within an ApaLI restriction site located in the transcribed strand 105 nucleotides downstream of the transcription initiation site (Fig. 1). The purified circular DNA was digested with ApaLI, FokI, and AflIII endonucleases, resulting in a 953-bp fragment containing the cisplatin lesion (Fig. 1). ApaLI activity is inhibited by the cisplatin lesion within its recognition site and thus cleaves 953-bp fragments that do not contain the cisplatin lesion. The 953-bp fragment was then biotinylated at the FokI restriction site by a Klenow fill-in reaction with Bio-dUTP (Roche) and purified after separation on agarose gel with a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen). When needed, the biotinylated DNA fragment was fixed on magnetic Streptavidin-coated beads (Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Dynal) as described previously (25Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transcription on Immobilized DNA Template—Transcription was carried out as described previously (25Marshall N.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32430-32437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, reaction mixtures of 12 μl containing 50 ng of immobilized DNA template and 30 μg of HeLa nuclear extract (NE) or CSB-depleted HeLa whole cell extract (WCE) were pre-incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in transcription buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 7 mm MgCl2, 55 mm KCl) and transcription was initiated by the addition of 2 μl nucleotide solution to final concentrations of 600 μm UTP, dATP, ApC and 0.6 μm [α-32P]CTP. Incubation for 30 s at 30 °C resulted in pulse labeled transcripts. Reactions were then stopped by the addition of 0.5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8). Beads were sequentially washed with transcription buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% Sarkosyl. The nascent transcripts were then elongated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 600 μm ATP, UTP, CTP, and GTP. The resulting RNA transcripts were analyzed on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Transcription reactions with 32P-labeled RNAP IIA (26Marshall N.F. Dahmus G.K. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31726-31730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were performed as described above except that HeLa NE was pre-incubated with the radiolabeled RNAP IIA for 10 min on ice before template addition, and [α-32P]CTP was replaced by cold CTP. Dual Incision Reaction—The removal of the cisplatin damage by dual incision was monitored by the occurrence of the excised damage-containing oligonucleotides (24Shivji M.K. Moggs J.G. Kuraoka I. Wood R.D. Methods Mol.Biol. 1999; 113: 373-392PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilized cisplatinated DNA template (50 ng) was incubated for 40 min at 30 °C in dual incision assay buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 90 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm ATP, and 20 μm wortmannin) together with 30 μg of a repair-competent HeLa WCE or a repair-deficient WCE from HD2 cells bearing a point mutation in the XPD gene (27Johnson R.T. Squires S. Ellion G.C. Koch G.L.E. Rainbow A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 76: 115-133PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min after addition of 9 ng of a 32-nucleotide oligonucleotide complementary to the excised damaged DNA patch that contains a 5′ extension of four extra G residues. After annealing the oligonucleotide to the excised DNA fragment, excision products were radiolabeled by extension with 130 milliunits of Sequenase (USB Corporation) and 0.3 μm [α-32P]dCTP for 3 min at 37 °C. Finally, 0.6 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 0.1 μm dCTP were added, and the incubation continued for 12 min at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and analyzed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. In dual incision reactions with purified NER factors (RIS), the WCE was replaced by 0.3 μl of TFIIH (HAP fraction (28Gerard M. Fischer L. Moncollin V. Chipoulet J.M. Chambon P. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20940-20945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 5 ng of XPG, 15 ng of XPF-ERCC1, 10 ng of XPC-HR23B, 50 ng of RPA, and 25 ng of XPA, which were expressed and purified as described previously (29Araujo S.J. Tirode F. Coin F. Pospiech H. Syvaoja J.E. Stucki M. Hubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 349-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Resynthesis Assay—Fifty ng of the immobilized cisplatinated DNA template was incubated with 30 μg of HeLa WCE or CSB-depleted WCE in the dual incision reaction buffer for 60 min at 30 °C. The reactions contained 5 μm of each dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 1 μm dCTP, and 0.8 μm [α-32P]dCTP. After incubation, the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and digested with EcoRI and NdeI, resulting in a 94-nucleotide fragment containing the resynthesized DNA patch. After a second phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was loaded on a 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. RNAP II and Transcript Release Assays—Immobilized, damaged DNA was transcribed as described above. After transcript elongation, the DNA beads were magnetically separated and washed three times with the transcription buffer containing 0.5% Sarkosyl. Washed beads were then incubated for 40 min at 30 °C under dual incision assay conditions in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP. After incubation, DNA beads were separated from the supernatant, and both fractions were analyzed for radiolabeled RNA transcript (8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel) and/or the 32P-labeled RNAP II (6% SDS-PAGE). Bands were visualized by autoradiography. Recombinant CSB used in release assays was purified as described previously (30Bradsher J. Auriol J. Proietti de Santis L. Iben S. Vonesch J.L. Grummt I. Egly J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). mRNA Immunoprecipitation—The cisplatin-damaged DNA template (953-bp fragment) was radiolabeled in a Klenow fill-in reaction with [α-32P]dATP and subsequently purified with a NucleoSpin Extract kit (Macherey-Nagel). Transcription on the radiolabeled template was initiated as described above, and 600 μm nucleotide triphosphates were directly added to the pulse labeling mix. After transcript elongation for 10 min at 30 °C, purified D44 anti-RNA antibody ((31Eilat D. Hochberg M. Fischel R. Laskov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3818-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Daniel Reines) was added, and incubation continued for 30 min at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were then absorbed to pre-equilibrated Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech) for 50 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After several washes with 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Sarkosyl, the collected beads were analyzed for bound DNA template and mRNA transcript or subjected to a dual incision assay. RNAP II Elongation Is Blocked by Cisplatin Damage—To study the fate of transcription complexes arrested at sites of DNA damage, we generated a DNA template containing the adenovirus major late promoter and a defined cisplatin lesion located in the transcribed strand 105 nucleotides downstream of the transcription start site (Fig. 1). The undamaged control DNA template gives rise to a run-off transcript of 558 nucleotides in length. Incorporation of a biotinylated uridine residue at the 3′ end of the template allows the immobilization of these DNA templates onto Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Pre-initiation complexes on either damaged or undamaged immobilized template were formed by incubation with HeLa NE in the absence of ribonucleotides. Transcription was then initiated by providing ApC dinucleotide, UTP, dATP, and [α-32P]CTP. The addition of EDTA after incubation for 30 s resulted in elongation complexes paused predominantly at U11 (Figs. 1 and 2A, lanes 1 and 4). These complexes remained stably associated with the immobilized template after washes with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% Sarkosyl to remove unstably bound RNAP II, radiolabeled nucleotide and HeLa transcription extract. Transcription was then resumed by elongating the nascent transcripts for various periods of time in the presence of unlabeled ribonucleotides (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–3 and 5–6). The pattern of transcripts produced from each template is comparable through the 15-s chases (Fig. 2A, compare lane 2 with lane 5). More importantly, after a 600-s chase, only the undamaged template yielded a run-off transcript (Fig. 2A, lane 3), whereas RNAP II transcribing the cisplatinated template paused at the site of the damage (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Therefore, the cisplatin lesion presents a strong impediment to the progression of the RNAP II elongation complex. RNAP II Stalled at the Cisplatin Lesion Does Not Inhibit DNA Repair—Because RNAP II stalled at the site of a lesion is thought to trigger the TCR process (8Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the immobilized damaged DNA template can be repaired when a transcription elongation complex is blocked at the cisplatin lesion. The immobilized, radiolabeled DNA containing the cisplatin lesion was first transcribed as described above, whereas in control reactions, transcription was inhibited by the addition of α-amanitin. After being extensively washed, the transcribed immobilized DNA contained RNAP II, primarily in its hyperphosphorylated (elongating) IIO form, the nascent RNA transcript (see below and Figs. 3 and 4), as well as TFIIF (data not shown). The cisplatinated DNA containing the RNAP II elongation complexes stalled at the lesion was further tested for NER by the dual incision and DNA resynthesis assay using a HeLa extract (Fig. 2B, upper and middle panels). Because RNAP II has initiated transcription on only a minor fraction of template DNA (21Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a difference between transcribed and nontranscribed DNA may not be apparent (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, to eliminate damaged DNA that does not contain a stalled RNAP II elongation complex, the immobilized DNA was digested with ClaI restriction endonuclease after the washing step and prior to the repair reaction (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). The ClaI restriction site is located at position +85, 20 nucleotides upstream of the lesion site (Fig. 1). Accordingly, template DNA containing lesionstalled elongation complexes will be protected from digestion, whereas unprotected DNA will be cut by ClaI. In this later case, the DNA fragment containing the cisplatin lesion will be removed from the immobilized DNA template, and consequently, the remaining immobilized DNA fragment cannot serve as a substrate in a repair reaction (Fig. 2B, middle and upper panels, lane 2). Indeed, ClaI cleavage of the template was nearly complete when transcription was inhibited by α-amanitin (Fig. 2B, lower panel, lane 2). On the contrary, when the DNA template was transcribed before ClaI digestion, a significant portion of the template remained uncut (Fig. 2B, lower panel, compare lane 1 with lane 2). The transcribed template digested with ClaI still allows dual incision and resynthesis to occur although, as expected, to a lower extent than with the undigested template. This decrease in activity directly reflects the portion of immobilized DNA that is actively transcribed (∼5%) (Fig. 2B, compare lane 1 with lane 3). The fraction of immobilized DNA resistant to ClaI digestion is in agreement with the fraction of DNA known to be transcribed under these conditions based on the quantitation of nascent transcript and RNAP II bound (21Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14923-14932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Notably, the damaged DNA containing a stalled elongating RNAP is accurately repaired, as determined by DNA sequencing, and can be transcribed as determined by the presence of a run-off transcript of 558 nucleotides in length (data not shown).Fig. 4Effect of CSB on transcript release.A, Western blot of washed ternary complexes stalled at the cisplatin lesion. The phosphorylation states of the largest RNAP II subunits (IIo or IIa) as well as the presence of CSB were analyzed. Transcription has been inhibited by α-amanitin (lane 2). B, Western blot (left panel), transcription (RNA) and repair (Resynthesis) analysis (right panel) of CSB-depleted HeLa WCE. Controls included undepleted and mock-depleted HeLa WCE.

Both the supernatant (S) (lanes 3, 5, and 7) and the DNA beads (B) (lanes 2, 4, and 6) of the reaction were analyzed for RNA transcript. The length of the damage-stalled RNA transcript is indicated (105 nt). When noted, recombinant CSB protein had been added to the reaction (lanes 6 and 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results show that an immobilized template containing a single cisplatin lesion can be both transcribed and repaired. Furthermore, transcription results in protection of a fraction of the template from ClaI digestion, suggesting that a RNAP II-containing elongation complex is stalled in front of the damage. Such stalled RNAP II complexes do not inhibit NER by a HeLa extract system. Lesion-stalled Elongation Complexes Are Released in an ATP-dependent Manner—We also investigated whether the DNA repair reaction with HeLa WCE might affect elongation complexes stalled at the site of the lesion. The fate of paused complexes was monitored by determining the fraction of radio-labeled RNAP II and transcript bound to and released from the template before and after the repair reaction (Fig. 3). Transcription on the immobilized damaged DNA was performed as described above, and stalled ternary complexes (RNAP II-RNA-DNA) were extensively washed with buffer containing 0.5% Sarkosyl before the addition of a repair-competent HeLa WCE as indicated (Fig. 3). Repair was initiated by the addition of ATP. First, complexes stalled at the lesion are stable in that extensive washes of elongation complexes failed to dissociate an appreciable amount of either the nascent transcript or RNAP II from the immobilized DNA (Fig. 3, compare lane 1 with lane 7). As expected, RNAP II stalled at the cisplatin lesion is primarily in the hyperphosphorylated IIO form (Fig. 3, lower panel, lane 7). Second, when stalled ternary complexes are incubated in the presence of ATP, conditions that support repair, most of the RNA transcript (95%) and a substantial amount of the RNAP II (50%), are released from the template (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 8), indicating destabilization of the elongating complex and suggesting that RNA release might occur independently from RNAP II release. Moreover, we noticed that ∼50% of such released RNA transcript is shortened (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 2 and 5), indicating that damage-stalled RNAP II is part of a dynamic process that allows it to slide back before being released from the DNA template and/or to give access to RNA-digesting enzymes. Surprisingly, the release of the nascent transcript and RNAP II was not observed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 9). However, in the absence of AT"

Both of the human isoforms, NAT1 and NAT2, display interindividual variations, and associations between NAT genotypes and cancer risk have been established. Contrary to NAT2, NAT1 has a ubiquitous tissue distribution and has been shown to be expressed in cancer cells. Given that the activity of NAT1 depends on a reactive cysteine that can be a target for oxidants, we studied whether peroxynitrite, a highly reactive nitrogen species involved in human carcinogenesis, could inhibit the activity of endogenous NAT1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. We show here that exposure of MCF7 cells to physiological concentrations of peroxynitrite and to a peroxynitrite generator (3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide, or SIN1) leads to the irreversible inactivation of NAT1 in cells. Further kinetic and mechanistic analyses using recombinant NAT1 showed that the enzyme is rapidly (kinact = 5 × 104m–1·s–1) and irreversibly inactivated by peroxynitrite. This inactivation is due to oxidative modification of the catalytic cysteine. We conclude that the reducing cellular environment of MCF7 cells does not sufficiently protect NAT1 from peroxynitrite-dependent inactivation and that only high concentrations of reduced glutathione could significantly protect NAT1. Thus, cellular generation of peroxynitrite may contribute to carcinogenesis and tumor progression by weakening key cellular defense enzymes such as NAT1.

Many arylamines, such as 4-aminobiphenyl (a tobacco-associated compound) and benzidine (occupational exposure) are important environmental carcinogens (1Badawi A.F. Hirvonen A. Bell D.A. Lang N.P. Kadlubar F.F. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5230-5237PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hein D.W. McQueen C.A. Grant D.M. Goodfellow G.H. Kadlubar F.F. Weber W.W. Drug Metab.

In humans, these reactions are catalyzed by two xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XME), 1The abbreviations used are: XME, xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes; NAT, arylamine N-acetyltransferase; SIN1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide; PAS, p-aminosalicylic acid; PNPA, p-nitrophenylacetate; AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; DTT, 1,4-dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 and arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT1 and NAT2; EC 2.3.1.5). Both of the human isoforms, NAT1 and NAT2, display interindividual variations and associations between NAT genotypes, and cancer risk has been established (1Badawi A.F. Hirvonen A. Bell D.A.

Sim E. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In addition, these cytosolic enzymes are encoded by two separate genes located on 8p22, a chromosomal region commonly deleted in certain human cancers (5Butcher N.J. Boukouvala S. Sim E. Minchin R.F. Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Matas N. Thygesen P. Stacey M. Risch A. Sim E. Cytogenet.

This raised the possibility that the absence of NATs or their inactivation may contribute to carcinogenesis and/or tumor progression (6Matas N. Thygesen P. Stacey M. Risch A. Sim E. Cytogenet.

Despite their high degrees of sequence identity, NAT1 and NAT2 differ markedly in terms of amine-containing acceptor substrates (10Grant D.M. Blum M. Beer M. Meyer U.A. Mol.

Indeed, NAT2 is primarily located in the liver and colon epithelium (13Deguchi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18140-18147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ilett K.F. Ingram D.M.

Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, NAT1 expression has been demonstrated in different cancers and especially in human breast cancer, where it may play a role in cancer progression (17Adam P.J. Berry J. Loader J.A. Tyson K.L. Craggs G. Smith P. De Belin J. Steers G. Pezzella F. Sachsenmeir K.F. Stamps A.C. Herath A. Sim E. O'Hare M.J. Harris A.L. Terrett J.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 826-835PubMed Google Scholar). NAT isoforms have been detected in a number of species, from bacteria to mammals (11Pompeo F. Brooke E. Kawamura A. Mushtaq A. Sim E.

Crystallographic determination of the structure of the NATs from Salmonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium smegmatis, and the subsequent construction of theoretical models of human NAT1 and NAT2 revealed structural similarities to cysteine proteases (19Sinclair J.C.

These data demonstrated the existence of a conserved cysteine protease-like catalytic triad (Cys, His, and Asp) in NATs (19Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E. Nat. Struct.

Thus, NATs may be prone to inactivation by oxidative reactions as shown recently for NAT1 (25Atmane N. Dairou J. Paul A. Dupret J.M. Rodrigues-Lima F. J. Biol.

They have been implicated in major physiological and pathophysiological processes such as vasorelaxation, apoptosis, inflammation, and cancer through the oxidative modification of DNA, proteins, or lipids (30Maeda H. Akaike T. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 854-865PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ignarro L.J. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 32Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Peroxynitrite (ONOO–) is one of the most reactive and, therefore, most deleterious nitric oxide derivatives involved in the oxidative modification of biological molecules (32Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Liu L. Stamler J.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite affects protein functions by modifying essential reactive thiols or tyrosine residues (32Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been shown to irreversibly inactivate fundamental enzymes such as creatine kinase (34Konorev E.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), tryptophan hydroxylase (35Kuhn D.M. Geddes T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29726-29732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), caspases (36Mohr S. Zech B. Lapetina E.G. Brune B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and phosphatases (37Takakura K. Beckman J.S. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). XMEs, such as cytochromes P450 (38Daiber A. Herold S. Schoneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6729-6739PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lin H.L. Kent U.M. Zhang H. Waskell L. Hollenberg P.F. Chem. Res.

Biophys. 2001; 394: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), have also been reported to be irreversibly inactivated by peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite generation has been demonstrated during sepsis as well as in autoimmune and inflammatory conditions (32Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 41Radi R. Cassina A. Hodara R. Quijano C. Castro L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1451-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In addition, evidence is accumulating from studies in vitro and in vivo that peroxynitrite is generated during carcinogenesis and promotes this process, in particular for colon and breast cancer (30Maeda H. Akaike T. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 854-865PubMed Google Scholar, 42Payne C.M. Bernstein C. Bernstein H. Gerner E.W. Garewal H. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 1999; 1: 449-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 43Szaleczky E. Pronai L. Nakazawa H. Tulassay Z. J. Clin. Gastroenterol. 2000; 30: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Samoszu M. Brennan M.L. To V. Leonor L. Zheng L. Fu X. Hazen S.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 74: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As stated above, NAT1 has been shown to be highly expressed in normal and cancerous human breast tissue (17Adam P.J. Berry J. Loader J.A. Tyson K.L. Craggs G. Smith P. De Belin J. Steers G. Pezzella F. Sachsenmeir K.F. Stamps A.C. Herath A. Sim E. O'Hare M.J. Harris A.L. Terrett J.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 826-835PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate whether peroxynitrite could inhibit endogenous NAT1 in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Using peroxynitrite and the peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN1), we investigated the effect of peroxynitrite on the activity of NAT1 in human breast cancer cells. We found that exposure of cultured MCF7 cells to physiological concentrations of peroxynitrite or SIN1 for a short period of time (10–30 min) led to the irreversible inactivation of the endogenous NAT1 enzyme. Further mechanistic analyses of the reaction of peroxynitrite with purified recombinant NAT1 showed that this XME is very rapidly (kinact = 5 × 104m–1·s–1) and irreversibly inactivated by physiological concentrations of peroxynitrite. In addition, we showed that the peroxynitrite-dependent inactivation of NAT1 was due to irreversible oxidative modification of the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzyme. Thus, our results suggest that NAT1 activity may be regulated in vivo by nitrosative stress, with potentially important implications in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Materials—Peroxynitrite and SIN1 hydrochloride were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem, and their chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS), p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA), acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA), coenzyme A (CoA), 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), and reduced glutathione (GSH) were obtained from Sigma. The vector, pET28, was purchased from Novagen. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin was obtained from Qiagen. Anti-fluorescein Fab′ fragments conjugated to peroxidase, fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide, and Complete protease inhibitor tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. The Bradford protein assay kit was supplied by Bio-Rad. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Eurobio. Polyclonal antibody against human NAT1 was a kind gift of Prof. Edith Sim (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). Cell Culture, Peroxynitrite/SIN1 Treatment, and Total Cell Extracts—MCF7 cells (human breast carcinoma) were cultured as monolayers in 100-mm Petri dishes at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. At ≈90% confluence, cell monolayers were washed with PBS (Ca2+/Mg2+). Cell monolayers were exposed to different concentrations of peroxynitrite or SIN1 in 10 ml of PBS and kept for 10 min (peroxynitrite) or 30 min (SIN1) at 37 °C. Control treatments were performed with decomposed SIN1 (obtained by allowing decomposition at room temperature in the dark for 48 h) or with PBS only. After treatment, monolayers were washed with PBS, scraped in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, 0.2% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Supernatants (total cell extracts) were taken, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method. All cell extracts were adjusted to the same protein concentration by adding 20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and then used in the experiments described below. Detection of Endogenous NAT1 Protein in MCF7 Cell Extracts—To assess the amount of NAT1 in MCF7 cell extracts, all NAT1 protein present in these extracts was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C using a saturating amount of purified anti-NAT1 antibody (1 μg of IgG fraction) in a total volume of 300 μl. Equal amounts of protein A-agarose were then added, and the mixture was rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice with PBS. Bound NAT1 was eluted by boiling in non-reducing SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-NAT1 antibody. Production and Purification of Recombinant Human NAT1—The human NAT1 cDNA was subcloned into pET28. This construct was used to transform BL21 (DE3) bacteria, which were then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and cultured for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria from a 1-liter culture were collected by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 30 min), washed with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and centrifuged again (6,000 × g, 30 min). The pellet was resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl (lysis buffer) containing lysozyme (1 mg/ml final concentration), and protease inhibitors. Following incubation (1 h at 4 °C), protease inhibitors, DNase I (20 μg/ml final concentration), and 0.2% Triton X-100 (final concentration) were added, and the suspension was incubated for a further 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was then subjected to sonication on ice (five pulses of 10 s each) and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was incubated with 1.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin in the presence of 20 mm imidazole for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was then poured into a column and washed successively with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100 and lysis buffer supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. Recombinant NAT1 was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Purified NAT1 was reduced by incubation with 10 mm DTT for 10 min at 4 °C and then dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA and stored at –80 °C. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out at each stage of purification, and protein concentrations were determined with a standard Bradford assay. Enzyme Assay—Detection of NAT1 activity in MCF7 cell extracts was performed as described previously (45Sinclair J.C. Delgoda R. Noble M.E. Jarmin S. Goh N.K. Sim E. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 12: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 100 μl. Cell extracts (50 μl) and p-aminobenzoic acid (200 μm) in assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. AcCoA (400 μm) was added to start the reaction, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for different times (up to 30 min). The reaction was quenched with 100 μl of ice-cold aqueous trichloroacetic acid (20% w/v), and the proteins were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g. 4-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (DMAB; 800 μl, 5% w/v in 9:1 acetonitrile/water) was added, and the absorbance was measured in 10-mm pathlength cuvettes at 450 nm (Uvikon Spectrophotometer). The amount of the remaining arylamine was determined from a standard curve. All assays were performed in triplicate in conditions such that the initial rates were linear. Enzyme activities were normalized according to the protein concentration of cell extracts and are expressed as percentages of control NAT1 activity (untreated MCF7 monolayers taken as 100% activity). Recombinant NAT1 enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically at 410 nm using PNPA as the acetyl donor and PAS as a NAT1-specific arylamine substrate, as described by Mushtaq et al. (46Mushtaq A. Payton M. Sim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (10–20 μl) were assayed in a reaction mixture containing 500 μm PAS (final concentration) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Reactions were started by adding PNPA to a final concentration of 125 μm. All assays were carried out in a total volume of 1 ml such that the final concentration of NAT1 was always 15 nm. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C and then quenched by SDS (1%). p-Nitrophenol, generated by the hydrolysis of PNPA by NAT1 in the presence of PAS, was quantified by measuring absorbance at 410 nm with an ELISA plate reader (Metertech). One enzyme unit was defined as the amount of enzyme giving an A410 of 0.5 per 10 min per milliliter. For the controls, we omitted the enzyme, PNPA, or PAS. All assays were performed in quadruplicate in conditions such that the initial rates were linear. Enzyme activities are expressed as percentages of control NAT1 activity (untreated enzyme taken as 100% activity). The total volume of the enzyme assay (1 ml) resulted in dilution of the various compounds used to a sufficient extent (1 in 50 or 1 in 100) to prevent interference with NAT1 enzyme activity measurements. Effects of Bolus Peroxynitrite and Peroxynitrite Generated by SIN1 on Recombinant NAT1 Activity in the Presence or Absence of Various Chemical Compounds—SIN1 is a chemical agent that mimics the generation of peroxynitrite occurring under physiological conditions by generating both superoxide and nitric oxide (47Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Konorev E. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These two molecules react together extremely rapidly (at a constant rate close to the diffusion limit), leading to the quantitative formation of peroxynitrite (37Takakura K. Beckman J.S. MacMillan-Crow L.A. Crow J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 47Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Konorev E. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, SIN1 is frequently used to generate peroxynitrite in chemical and biological experimental systems (47Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Konorev E. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 361: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We used SIN1 to generate peroxynitrite in all experiments except in the experiment that determined the rate constant for the reaction of peroxynitrite with NAT1. We assessed the effects on NAT1 activity of peroxynitrite and peroxynitrite released by SIN1 by incubating purified NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) with various concentrations of bolus peroxynitrite or SIN1 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA (total volume of 10 μl) for 10 min at 37 °C. Mixtures were then assayed for NAT1 activity as described above. We investigated the ability of reducing agents to protect NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) from the effects of peroxynitrite by carrying out SIN1 treatment in the presence or absence of various concentrations of DTT or GSH and then determining residual NAT1 activity. We assessed reactivation of the SIN1-treated enzyme by reducing agents as follows. NAT1 enzyme (1.5 μm final concentration) was first treated with SIN1 (250 μm final concentration) as described above. It was then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of DTT or GSH in a total volume of 20 μl, and a NAT1 assay was carried out. Control assays in the conditions described above, with GSH or DTT only, gave 100% NAT1 activity. We assessed the extent to which AcCoA and CoA protected against the SIN1-dependent inactivation of NAT1 as follows. NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was first incubated with various concentrations of AcCoA or CoA (final concentrations of 100 μm to 5 mm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA (total volume of 10 μl) for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated with SIN1 (250 μm final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 20 μl and assayed. Control assays carried out in the conditions described above, with AcCoA or CoA only, gave 100% NAT1 activity. Kinetic Analysis of the Peroxynitrite-dependent Inactivation of NAT1—NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was incubated with bolus peroxynitrite (final concentrations of 0–55 μm) at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C and assayed for residual activity. We determined the second-order rate constant for the reaction of peroxynitrite and NAT1 (kinact) by carrying out kinetic analysis as described by Radi et al. (48Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), taking into account the spontaneous degradation of peroxynitrite at pH 7.5 and 37 °C. Under these conditions, changes in peroxynitrite (PN) and NAT1 concentrations as a function of time are expressed as shown in Equations 1 and 2, d[PN]dt=-kinact·[NAT1]·[PN]-kdec·[PN](Eq. 1) d[NAT1]dt=-kinact·[NAT1]·[PN](Eq. 1) where [NAT1] is the concentration of the enzyme, [PN] the concentration in peroxynitrite, kinact the second-order rate constant for the inactivation of NAT1 by peroxynitrite, and kdec the first-order rate constant for the decomposition of peroxynitrite. In our conditions (37 °C, pH 7.5), the value of kdec has been shown to be 0.9 s–1 (48Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

Finally, Equation 3 predicts that a plot of ln of fractional activity of NAT1 versus the initial concentration of peroxynitrite should be linear. The value of kinact is deduced from the slope (kobs). Kinetic data were plotted and fitted using KaleidaGraph version 3.5 (Abelbeck Software). Fluorescein-conjugated Iodoacetamide Labeling of Proteins—Purified NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was incubated with or without (control) various concentrations of SIN1 (from 50 to 500 μm final concentration) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide (20 μm final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and Western blotting with anti-fluorescein Fab′ fragments conjugated to peroxidase. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate. The statistical significance of differences between means was evaluated using Student's t test. The level of significance was set at p = 0.05. Protein Determination, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (BioRad). Samples for gel electrophoresis were mixed with reducing or non-reducing 4× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blotting after separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS) supplemented with 5% nonfat milk powder for 1 h. Anti-fluorescein Fab′ fragments conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:100000) in TBS were added. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h and washed with TBS.

The CP1 domain of IleRS deacylates, or edits, the mischarged Val-tRNAIle. We determined the crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain alone, and in its complex with valine at 1.8- and 2.0-Å resolutions, respectively. In the complex structure, the Asp328 residue, which was shown to be critical for the editing reaction against Val-tRNAIle by a previous mutational analysis, recognizes the valine NH3+ group. The valine side chain binding pocket is only large enough to accommodate valine, and the placement of an isoleucine model in this location revealed that the additional methylene group of isoleucine would clash with His319. The H319A mutant of Escherichia coli IleRS reportedly deacylates the cognate Ile-tRNAIle in addition to Val-tRNAIle, indicating that the valine-binding mode found in this study represents that in the Val-tRNAIle editing reaction. Analyses of the Val-tRNAIle editing activities of T. thermophilus IleRS mutants revealed the importance of Thr228, Thr229, Thr230, and Asp328, which are coordinated with water molecules in the present structure. The structural model for the Val-adenosine moiety of Val-tRNAIle bound in the IleRS editing site revealed some interesting differences in the substrate binding and recognizing mechanisms between IleRS and T. thermophilus leucyl-tRNA synthetase. For example, the carbonyl oxygens of the amino acids are located opposite to each other, relative to the adenosine ribose ring, and are differently recognized.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; IleRS, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase; ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase; LeuRS, leucyl-tRNA synthetase. catalyze the esterification of an amino acid to its cognate tRNA. This reaction proceeds in two steps: the synthesis of an aminoacyladenylate, as an activated intermediate, from the amino acid and ATP, and the transfer of the aminoacyl moiety to the 3′-terminal of the cognate tRNA to yield the aminoacyl-tRNA (1Fersht A.R. Kaethner M.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3342-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To maintain accurate protein biosynthesis, each aaRS must discriminate between its cognate amino acid and other similar amino acids (2Pauling L. In Festschrift Arthur Stroll. Birkhäuser-Verlag, Basel1957: 597-602Google Scholar, 3Freist W. Sternbach H. Cramer F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Some aaRSs, including the isoleucyl-, leucyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRS, LeuRS, and ValRS, respectively), have a specific editing activity that hydrolyzes the misaminoacylated tRNAs (“post-transfer editing”) (4Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Englisch S. Englisch U. von der Haar F. Cramer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 7529-7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Baldwin A.N. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 839-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, IleRS also recognizes valine, which is smaller than the cognate isoleucine by only one methylene group, and mischarges it with tRNAIle. Then, the mischarged Val-tRNAIle is hydrolyzed to valine and tRNAIle in the post-transfer editing pathway. As for IleRS, another editing pathway (pre-transfer editing) also exists, in which the misactivated Val-AMP is directly hydrolyzed to valine and AMP in the presence of tRNAIle (7Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 8Hale S.P. Auld D.S. Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1997; 276: 1250-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments linked the specific location of the editing site to the connective polypeptide 1 (CP1) domain, a large insertion in the aminoacylation catalytic Rossmann-fold domain (9Lin L. Hale S.P. Schimmel P. Nature. 1996; 384: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Previously, we determined the crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus full-length IleRS complexed with isoleucine and with valine and showed that the editing site is in the highly conserved threonine-rich region of the CP1 domain (10Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus IleRS complexed with tRNAIle and mupirocin (an analogue of isoleucyl-adenylate) revealed that the 3′-terminal of tRNAIle is located in the CP1 domain (although it was not completely resolved) (11Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). This suggested that when a nearly cognate amino acid is charged to a tRNA, the acceptor stem flips from the aminoacylation site to the editing site, while the rest of the tRNA remains bound. However, the B factors of many atoms in the CP1 domains of these structures were high and some residues were disordered, since the CP1 domain is quite mobile relative to the rest of the protein (10Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 11Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our previous study (10Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), the omit map electron density for valine was not clear enough for us to determine its orientation precisely, and the coordinates were determined by analogy with the related ValRS system (12Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T. thermophilus ValRS complexed with tRNAval accurately revealed the location of the 3′ terminus of tRNAval in the CP1 domain with complete resolution, although that of threonine (which is edited by ValRS) remains to be elucidated (12Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Based on the location of valine in the IleRS CP1 domain and that of the tRNA 3′-terminal adenosine in the ValRS CP1 domain, we built the structural models for Val-tRNAIle in IleRS and Thr-tRNAval in ValRS, assuming that their binding modes are analogous (12Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, differences between their binding modes were subsequently reported (13Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20510-20517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, no water molecules could be assigned around the valine bound to the CP1 domain in the full-length T. thermophilus IleRS structure. Therefore, the precise valine-binding mode and the mechanisms by which the IleRS CP1 domain selectively recognizes valine and catalyzes the hydrolysis of Val-tRNAIle remained to be elucidated. Recently, the crystal structure of T. thermophilus LeuRS complexed with the post-transfer editing substrate analogue was determined (14Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In comparison with IleRS, the CP1 domain is inserted at a different point in the enzyme, and its rotational orientation differs by nearly 180° from IleRS (14Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol.

The structure provided the precise substrate-binding mode, in which conserved Thr residues recognize the substrate (14Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the LeuRS crystal structures revealed that both the pre- and post-transfer editing analogues are bound in one site in the CP1 domain, although a mutational analysis showed that distinct residues are needed between the pre- and post-transfer editing reactions in IleRS (16Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. de Crecy-Lagard V. Fukai S. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, the substrate-binding modes may differ between IleRS and LeuRS. In the present study, to study specifically the post-transfer editing mechanism of IleRS, we isolated the T. thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain (201-384 amino acids), which contains the post-transfer editing site, but lacks a part of the pre-transfer editing site, based on the previous model (12Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Hendrickson T.L.

We determined its crystal structure at 1.8-Å resolution. Then, we determined its cocrystal structure with valine at 2.0-Å resolution. In the complex structure, the valine is located in the same pocket as in the case of the modeled Val-tRNAIle (12Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. de Crecy-Lagard V. Fukai S. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, its orientation within the pocket is quite different. This new valine-binding mode can explain the mutational data well, unlike the previous model. Furthermore, we examined the post-transfer editing activity of some mutant IleRSs. Based on the high resolution structural data and these and other mutational data, we created a new structural model of the Val-adenosine moiety of Val-tRNAIle in the editing state. In this model, the substrate recognition differs from that in the LeuRS system. Protein Preparation—The gene fragment encoding the T. thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain (201-384 amino acids with the initiating methionine) was subcloned into pET26b (Novagen). The construct was designed to have only the post-transfer editing site, but not the pre-transfer editing site, based on the previous model (12Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. de Crecy-Lagard V. Fukai S. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to study specifically the post-transfer editing mechanism. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain JM109(DE3). For protein overexpression, the cells were grown to an OD600 of 0.8, and the expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated in 50 mm K2HPO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was heat-treated at 70 °C for 30 min to denature the E. coli proteins. The heat-treated mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, 2.4 m (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.8 m. The mixture was applied to a 50 ml column of butyl-Toyopearl (Tosoh) equilibrated with 50 mm K2HPO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The CP1 domain was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.8-0 M (NH4)2SO4. The fractions containing the CP1 domain were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol, and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences) using an Amersham fast protein liquid chromatography system. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl. The CP1 domain protein was further purified on a UnoQ column (Bio-Rad) using an fast protein liquid chromatography system eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 M NaCl and was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The final purity of the protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization and Data Collection—For crystallization, the hanging drop vapor diffusion method was used, by mixing 1 μl of the protein solution (10 mg·ml-1) with 1 μl of the reservoir solution (50 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4 and 5% 2-propanol) and by equilibrating this mixture against 500 μl of the reservoir solutions at 20 °C. Crystals (space group P41212; unit-cell parameters a = b = 102.7 Å, c = 83.8 Å) were grown for 3 days to dimensions of ∼0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3. To obtain cocrystals of the CP1 domain complexed with valine, reservoir solutions containing 100 mm valine were used, and the crystals thus obtained were transferred to a solution containing 55 mm Hepes-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0), 2.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 5.5% 2-propanol, and 100 mm valine, 24 h before the data collection. The diffraction datasets of the ligand-free crystal were collected at beamline BL41XU at SPring-8 (Harima) to 1.8-Å resolution, and those of the complex crystal were collected at beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 to 2.0 Å resolution. A single crystal, flash-frozen at a temperature of -173 °C, was used for each experiment. Before flash-cooling, the crystals were transferred into a cryoprotective solution containing 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The ligand-free data sets were processed using the HKL2000 program (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymology. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), and the complex data sets were processed using MOSFLM/SCALA (18Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 1997; 39: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar), starting with the coordinates of the CP1 domain from the full-length T. thermophilus IleRS, which we previously determined at 2.5-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank ID, 1ILE) (10Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The rotated and translated model was first subjected to rigid-body refinement using 20-2.5 Å data sets collected from the ligand-free crystal. The model refinement was carried out using the program CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

After several rounds of Cartesian coordinate energy minimization, simulated annealing, B factor refinement, automatic water picking, and manual revision of the model, using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), R and Rfree decreased to 20.3% and 25.0%, respectively. A random sample containing 5% of the total reflections in the data sets was excluded from the refinement, to calculate Rfree. Using the data sets of the complex crystals, molecular replacement was carried out with the coordinates of the ligand-free CP1 domain structure. The structure refinement was performed in the same way. After building the valine ligand, further rounds of refinement were performed. The model refinement of the complex structure finally converged to an R value of 20.3% and an Rfree of 24.8%, with good stereochemistry. Ramachandran plot analysis using the program PROCHECK (22Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. L. M.A. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 28-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that all of the residues in both the ligand-free and complex structures, except for one residue in each structure, were in the most favored or additionally allowed regions. Omit maps for the valine and surrounding water molecules were calculated at the end of the refinement. Post-transfer Editing Assay of Mutant IleRSs—The full-length T. thermophilus IleRS gene was cloned into pET28c (Novagen). This plasmid encodes IleRS with a His tag on its C-terminal end. The mutations, T228A, T229A, T230A, T233A, T228A/T230A, T229/T230A, T230A/T233A, and D328A, were introduced using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were cultured and harvested by the same procedure used for the CP1 domain. Cells were sonicated in 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A). The insoluble cell debris and the E. coli proteins were removed by the same procedure used for the CP1 domain. The supernatant was applied to a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) chelated with Ni2+ ions and equilibrated with buffer A. After the column was washed with buffer A, the mutant IleRSs were eluted with 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 500 mm imidazole, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol and were dialyzed against 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2. The final purity of the proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE. [14C]Val-tRNAIle was prepared as described previously (23Giege R. Kern D. Ebel J.P. Grosjean H. de Henau S. Chantrenne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 45: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Schmidt E. Schimmel P. Science. 1994; 264: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Deacylation assays were performed at 37 °C in 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, [14C]Val-tRNAIle (1.4 μm, 1000 cpm/pmol), and each mutant IleRS (20 nm). Aliquots were removed at specific time points and quenched on filter papers (Whatman, 3 mm) equilibrated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The filters were washed 3 times with 5% trichloroacetic acid and once with 100% ethanol. The radioactivities of the precipitates were quantitated by scintillation counting. Overall Structure—We determined the high resolution crystal structure of the isolated T. thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain, containing the post-transfer editing site, at 1.8 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank ID, 1UDZ). The root-mean-square deviation between the isolated CP1 domain and the CP1 domain in the full-length IleRS over all Cα atoms is 0.91 Å, which is small enough to show that these two structures are quite similar to each other. Indeed, the secondary structures and the locations of the individual residues are almost the same, and therefore, the structure of the CP1 domain in this study reflects that of the full-length IleRS. Next, we determined the cocrystal structure of the CP1 domain complexed with valine at 2.0-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank ID, 1UE0) (Fig. 1A). Its overall structure is also quite similar to that of the CP1 domain in the full-length IleRS (Fig. 1B), and thus, no large conformational change occurs upon the valine binding. Valine-binding Mode—The editing active site is formed mainly by one β-strand (β8) and two almost parallel α-helices (α1 and α5). In the Fo - Fc omit map of the complex structure, there is a strong and clear electron density that could be attributed to the valine molecule in the editing active site (Fig. 2A), and there are some electron densities that could be attributed to water molecules around the valine. The high resolution complex structure revealed the precise valine recognition mechanism (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. 4A). The valine NH3+ hydrogen bonds to the Oδ of Asp328 and the α-CO of His319, and the valine COO- group hydrogen bonds to the Oγ atoms of Thr229 and Thr230, and the α-CO groups of Trp227 and Phe324, through water molecules. The valine side chain is surrounded by the side chains of Thr233, His319, Ala321, and Phe324, and the α-CO of Phe324. All of these residues are highly conserved in the IleRSs from other species (Fig. 6A). We previously proposed a valine-binding mode in the post-transfer editing state, which was modeled on the basis of the electron density corresponding to valine (although it was not clear enough to locate it unambiguously) in the full-length IleRS structure, and the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNAVal in the T. thermophilus ValRS· tRNAVal cocrystal structure (12Fukai S.

In the present structure, the valine is located in the same pocket as in the case of the modeled Val-tRNAIle, but its orientation within the pocket is different from that in the model (Fig. 3).Fig. 4The valine-binding pocket is just as large as valine.A, the contact surface representation of the nearly cognate valine and the amino acid binding pocket of the IleRS CP1 domain (stereo view).

However, the valine molecules are differently oriented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This valine-binding mode can nicely explain the mutational data of the E. coli H319A mutant IleRS, which the previous model could not. The H319A mutant hydrolyzes not only the nearly cognate Val-tRNAIle but also the cognate Ile-tRNAIle (16Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. de Crecy-Lagard V. Fukai S. Nureki O. Yokoyama S. Schimmel P. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 353-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present structure, valine fits well in the editing active site (the distance between the Nϵ2 of His319 and the Cγ of valine is 3.5 Å) (Fig. 4A), but when the isoleucine model is placed in the same site, the additional methylene group clashes with the side chain of His319 (the distance between the Nϵ2 of His319 and the Cδ of isoleucine would be 2.1 Å) (Fig. 4B). If this His319 residue was mutated to Ala, then the distances between the Ala Cβ and the valine Cγ or the isoleucine Cδ would be 5.4 or 4.7 Å, respectively. These data support the idea that the location of the valine in the determined structure represents the post-transfer editing state, while the previous model for the valine-binding mode could not explain this mutational analysis. Therefore, we concluded that the valine-binding mode in the present structure precisely reflects that of the valyl moiety of Val-tRNAIle in the editing state. Post-transfer Editing Assay of Mutant IleRSs—Previous biochemical experiments using E. coli IleRS showed that the T242A (corresponding to Thr229 in T. thermophilus IleRS) mutant is defective in the total editing activity (whether it affects post- or pre-transfer editing or both is unknown), while the T241A, T243A, and T246A E. coli IleRS mutants (Thr228, Thr230, and Thr233 in T. thermophilus IleRS, respectively) can still perform the total editing activity (10Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 25Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8180-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the D342A E. coli IleRS mutant (Asp328 in T. thermophilus IleRS) is defective in the post-transfer editing activity (26Bishop A.C. Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus far, all of the mutant analyses have been carried out using E. coli IleRS, with most examining only the aspect of total editing and not distinguishing between pre- and post-transfer editing. For a more precise understanding of the post-transfer editing reaction, we analyzed the post-transfer editing activity of Ala-replaced mutants of T. thermophilus IleRS. As a result, the T228A, T229A, T228A/T230A, T229A/T230A, and D328A mutants had some defects, while T230A, T233A, and T230A/T233A retained the full activity (Fig. 5). These data show that Thr228, Thr229, Thr230 (detectable only when Thr228 is also mutated to Ala), and Asp328 (Thr241, Thr242, Thr243, and Asp342, in E. coli IleRS, respectively) play some role in the post-transfer editing reaction. Previous results using E. coli IleRS showed that Thr228 and Thr230 were not critical for the total editing (10Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 25Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8180-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The Ala-replacing mutation of Thr230 leads to the defect only when Thr228 is also mutated to Ala, whereas the previous analysis examined only the single mutation of Thr230. The T228A defect is not as severe in the post-transfer editing, and in IleRS, the post-transfer editing was estimated to account for only 25% of the overall editing, while the remaining 75% was attributed to the pre-transfer editing (7Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). By assuming that the T228A mutant is only defective in the post-transfer editing, but not in the pre-transfer editing, we can account for the previous mutational analysis by not being able to detect the slight defect of the T228A mutant in the total editing. The more severe defect of the T228A/T230A double mutant than that of the T228A single mutant also shows the importance of the Thr228 residue in the post-transfer editing (Fig. 5). A Model for the Editing Mechanism—We tried to build a structural model for the Val-adenosine moiety of Val-tRNAIle. First, we superposed T. thermophilus ValRS complexed with tRNAval onto the T. thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain. However, the 3′-terminal adenosine of tRNAval and valine could not be ester bonded, even with a slight adjustment. The distance between the OH group of the tRNAval adenosine ribose and the valine COO- group was too far (data not shown). Then, we superposed T. thermophilus LeuRS complexed with a post-transfer editing substrate analogue onto the T. thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain (Fig. 6B). This time, although there were some differences in the editing site architecture, especially in the adenine base recognition region and the conserved threonine-rich region, the distance between the OH group of the adenosine ribose and the valine COO- group was close enough for linkage with a slight adjustment. We translated the adenosine to allow the ribose 2′-OH group to form an ester bond with the valine COO- group, and rotated it around the 2′-C-O bond. We also rotated the χ angle of the adenine base to adjust for the differences between the adenine base recognition regions of IleRS and LeuRS (Fig. 6A). Finally, we could build a fine model for the Val-adenosine moiety of Val-tRNAIle, without moving any atom of the valine molecule in the determined structure (Fig. 6C). This modeled substrate is favorably hydrogen bonded by the editing active site residues and does not clash against any residue. We compared the substrate-binding mode of IleRS with that of LeuRS (Fig. 6B). The locations of the amino acid NH3+ groups and the Asp residues (Asp328 and Asp347 in T. thermophilus IleRS and LeuRS, respectively) are quite similar, and the amino acid NH3+ groups are recognized by the Asp residues in a similar way. These Asp residues are completely conserved among IleRSs, LeuRSs, and ValRSs (Fig. 6A) and are critical in the IleRS post-transfer editing reactions (Fig. 5 and Ref. 23Giege R. Kern D. Ebel J.P. Grosjean H. de Henau S. Chantrenne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 45: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in the LeuRS total editing reactions (25Hendrickson T.L. Nomanbhoy T.K. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8180-8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction between the amino acid NH3+ group and the Asp residue must be vital for the editing reaction in both IleRSs and LeuRSs and maybe also in ValRSs. However, the orientations of the ester bond in the editing substrates are quite different between IleRS and LeuRS, and the threonine-rich region is closer to the substrate in LeuRS than in IleRS (Fig. 6B). In LeuRS, the amino acid carbonyl group is oriented toward the threonine-rich region and is recognized by Thr247 (Thr228 in IleRS) (Fig. 6B). In contrast, in IleRS, it is located opposite to the threonine-rich region and is recognized by the α-CO of His319 through the water molecule, not by the conserved threonine residue (Fig. 6C). In IleRS, only Thr229 hydrogen bonds to the substrate 5′-O, unlike the other conserved thereonine residues (Fig. 6C). These findings can account for the mutational data that Thr229 plays some role in the post-transfer editing, but Thr233 does not (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the water molecule, which hydrogen bonds to Asp328 and the NH3+ group of the substrate, is favorably located to act as the catalytic nucleophile for the ester bond hydrolysis (Fig. 6C). Conversely, in the determined valine-bound structure, Thr230 hydrogen bonds to the valine COO- group through the water molecule (Fig. 2, A and B), but the water molecule clashes with the ribose 3′-OH of the modeled substrate, and cannot exist in the same place in the model (data not shown). We will discuss the importance of Thr228 and Thr230 below. In the aminoacylation reaction by IleRS, valine is first mischarged to the 2′-OH of the tRNA 3′-terminal adenosine ribose (13Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20510-20517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, valine is transacylated to the 3′-OH from the 2′-OH, and vice versa, and stays in equilibrium. Until now, we have discussed the 2′-OH valylated tRNAIle model. Biochemical analyses using aminoacyl-tRNAs with a deoxygenized 2′-OH or 3′-OH of the 3′-terminal adenosine ribose, which the amino acid cannot transacylate, suggested that IleRS specifically deacylates valine from the 3′-OH but not from the 2′-OH, whereas ValRS can deacylate the mischarged threonine from the 2′-OH (13Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20510-20517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Considering these data, we built the binding mode model of another editing substrate, the 3′-OH valylated adenosine moiety of Val-tRNAIle (Fig. 7). Unlike the case of the 2′-OH valylated model, to make the 3′-OH valylated model, we moved the valyl moiety from the observed location in the determined valine-bound structure. In the 3′-OH valylated model, the recognition modes of the NH3+ group and the adenine base are similar to those in the 2′-OH valylated model (Figs. 6C and 7). In the 3′-OH valylated model, Thr229 hydrogen bonds directly to the adenosine 5′-O, as in the 2′-OH valylated model, and Thr228 and Thr230 hydrogen bond to the adenosine 3′-O through the water molecule (Fig. 7), as observed in the determined valine-bound structure (Fig. 2, A and B). This water molecule, which hydrogen bonds to Thr228 and Thr230, is favorably located to act as a catalytic nucleophile for the ester bond hydrolysis (Fig. 7). In this model, Thr228 and Thr230 participate in the substrate recognition, in contrast to the 2′-OH valylated model, thus confirming the mutational analysis that revealed the importance of these residues in the editing reaction. Although Thr230 is highly conserved in IleRSs, it is replaced with the highly conserved Arg residue in LeuRSs and ValRSs (Fig. 6A). This is consistent with the data that the mischarged amino acid is deacylated from the 3′-OH only in IleRS (13Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20510-20517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) but is deacylated from the 2′-OH in ValRS (13Nordin B.E. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20510-20517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and maybe also in LeuRS (14Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Moreover, these two binding-mode models are not mutually exclusive. Instead, both binding mechanisms might be used. That is, first the 2′-OH valylated tRNAIle is bound to the editing site, and after the valyl moiety is transferred to the 3′-OH from the 2′-OH, it is deacylated from the 3′-OH. In the 2′-OH valylated model, the 3′-OH is favorably located to act as a catalytic nucleophile for the transacylation reaction (Fig. 6C). Concluding Remarks—The high resolution crystal structure of the T. thermophilus IleRS CP1 domain complexed with the nearly cognate valine provides a precise understanding of the selective valine recognition mechanism. In addition, we were able to build the binding mode models of the two substrates, the 2′-OH valylated and the 3′-OH valylated adenosine moieties of Val-tRNAIle. These structure models illustrate the mutational data well and suggest a specific editing mechanism for IleRS, which is distinct from those of LeuRS and ValRS. Actually, only in IleRS, the pre-transfer editing is predominant (75% of the total editing) (7Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, we still need to determine whether the active site accommodates 2′-OH or 3′-OH valylated tRNAIle or both and to elucidate the precise binding mode. Moreover, the binding mode of the pre-transfer editing substrate is still unknown in IleRS, although in LeuRS, both substrates are recognized in the same binding site in similar manners (14Lincecum T.L. Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Mursinna R.S. Williams A.M. Sproat B.S. Van Den Eynde W. Link A. Van Calenbergh S. Grotli M. Martinis S.A. Cusack S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This structural study has provided significant clues toward elucidating the editing mechanism of IleRS. For a more precise understanding of both pre- and post-transfer editing, the determination of the IleRS structures complexed with nonhydrolyzable analogs of pre- and post-transfer editing substrates is required.

Ectopic expression of TurA both in P. putida and in Escherichia coli reporter strains and transcription in vitro of the Pu promoter in the presence of purified TurA confirmed the TurA repressor role on Pu activity. turA gene inactivation did not significantly alter two well characterized physiological regulations of the Pu expression in routine conditions of cultivation, exponential silencing, and carbon-mediated repression, respectively.

The number of genes that must be expressed for the aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds is usually high (1van der Meer J.R. de Vos W.M. Harayama S. Zehnder A.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 677-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and their well timed silencing increases host bacterium fitness in environmental conditions where the exploitation of the aromatic source is inefficient or unessential for bacterial growth (2Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 3Cases I. de Lorenzo V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In terms of evolution, to reach such physiological control, specific carbon regulatory devices have supposedly integrated in global networks able to sense the environmental stimuli. One example of this is the degradation of the aromatic hydrocarbons, toluene and m-/p-xylene, by the Pseudomonas putida, encoded by two large operons, upper and meta, harbored by the TOL mega-plasmid (for a review, see Ref. 4Ramos J.L. Marques S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Expression from the upper operon is driven by the σ54-dependent promoter Pu (Fig. 1C), activated at a distance in the presence of aromatic substrates of the catabolic pathway by the toluene-responsive regulator XylR (5de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Pérez-Martín J. de Lorenzo V.

In addition to the specific response to aromatic substrates, it is conceivable that the TOL system had integrated additional co-regulatory devices to avoid the expression of its energetically expensive pathway, under unfavorable physiochemical conditions (temperature, pH, osmolarity, etc.) and/or in the presence of more appetizing carbon and energy sources than toluenes. The influence of the physiochemical conditions on Pu expression has not been extensively characterized. On the contrary, the expression performance of Pu appears to be strictly dependent on the energetic status of the cell (2Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Cases I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). An abundance of nutrients results in strong repression of the Pu promoter during the exponential growth phase, a phenomenon that has been referred to as exponential silencing (12Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martín J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of carbon sources, such as glucose, gluconate, or α-chetoglutarate, exerts a form of carbon-mediated inhibition on Pu activity (13Holtel A. Marques S. Mohler I. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cases I. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15562-15568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the small signal molecule (p)ppGpp may participate in the Pu nutrient-responsive regulatory network (15Sze C.C. Bernardo L.M. Shingler V. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 760-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By contrast, the search for Pu regulatory protein components, which may be the effector molecules of environmental stimuli, has not been examined in any great depth to date. In this study, we aimed to identify novel protein factors involved in the physiological and/or environmental regulation of Pu expression. We envisaged the existence of host protein factor(s) that possibly played a co-regulatory role through direct protein-Pu DNA interactions. We decided to screen the P. putida proteome for proteins able to interact with Pu DNA. Using this approach, we identified a small Pu-interacting protein, which we named TurA. It shares in silico a degree of structural similarity with H-NS, the major protein constituent of the Escherichia coli nucleoid, widespread in Gram-negative bacteria (for reviews, see. Refs 16Atlung T. Ingmer H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar and 17Bertin P. Hommais F. Krin E. Soutourina O. Tendeng C. Derzelle S. Danchin A. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). H-NS is involved in the condensation of the bacterial chromosome (18Spassky A. Rimsky S. Garreau H. Buc H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5321-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Spurio R. Durrenberger M. Falconi M. La Teana A. Pon C.L. Gualerzi C.O. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and pleiotropically modulates the transcription of many environmentally regulated genes (e.g. by osmolarity, temperature, anaerobiosis, pH, growth phase, etc), including those related to environment adaptation and/or virulence (16Atlung T. Ingmer H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 20Falconi M. Colonna B. Prosseda G. Micheli G. Gualerzi C.O.

Microbiol. 2001; 40: 20-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). H-NS inhibits transcription at most of the target promoters, and hns gene inactivation generally results in increased expression of the cognate gene products. Furthermore, a number of genes negatively affected by H-NS are regulated by specific positive transcription factors. In this study, we show that the knock-out of the turA gene leads to increased expression of the Pu promoter. Furthermore, we present evidence, both in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating that TurA strongly represses XylR-mediated transcription of the Pu promoter. Inactivation of turA gene does not affect either exponential silencing or carbon-mediated inhibition of Pu expression. On the contrary, we present evidence showing that TurA-mediated repression of Pu activity can strengthen at suboptimal growth temperatures. Therefore, this study revealed a novel physiological modulation of Pu promoter that is different from those strictly nutritional described previously. Furthermore, the identification of TurA also represents a novelty in the field of the regulation of aromatic degradation pathways. In fact, to date, only protein regulatory components involved in the specific response to the aromatic inducers have been described. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and General Procedures—The P. putida strain MAD1 (Pu::lacZ, xylR+) is a derivative of P. putida KT2442 (rifampicin-resistant derivative of the reference strain P. putida KT2440) (22Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar) carrying a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion along with the xylR gene assembled within a tellurite resistance mini-transposon (23Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martín J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). MAD1 turA::KmR, the MAD1 derivative carrying a KmR cassette insertion in the PP1366 locus of KT2440 genome sequence (turA gene), was constructed by allelic exchange with a KmR-inserted allele as follows. The DNA region containing the PP1366 locus was amplified as an 832-bp BamHI-XbaI fragment from P. putida KT2440 genome by PCR utilizing the direct primer 5′-CGGGATCC(BamHI underlined) GGCGCCTATTCTAGCGGTCCGCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGTCTAGA(XbaI underlined)CGAAAAGGCGCGCCAGCAAGCCT-3′. This 832-bp fragment was cloned into the pCR® 2.1-TOPO® plasmid vector (Invitrogen), giving rise to pTBA1 plasmid. For an efficient selection of the integration event of a KmR cassette into the turA gene, the pTBA1 native KmR gene plasmid was deleted by digestion with both BglII and NcoI enzymes, treatment with Klenow, and religation, giving rise to pTBA2 plasmid. The plasmid pTBA::Km, carrying a KmR cassette into the turA gene, was constructed by digestion of pTBA2 DNA with BclI, cutting at the third codon of turA, and ligation with a 2.2-kb BamHI fragment containing a mini-Tn5 KmR cassette (24de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The 3.2-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment of pTBA::Km containing the KmR-inserted turA gene was cloned into pKNG101 (25Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), a mobilizable suicide vector, hosted routinely in the permissive E. coli strain CC118λpir (24de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), bearing the positive counter selection marker sacB and conferring resistance to streptomycin. The resulting plasmid pKNG101-turA::Km was transferred to P. putida MAD1 strain through triparental mating with the helper strain E. coli HB101 (RK600) as described previously (24de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination events between the wild-type and the KmR-inserted turA alleles generating co-integration of pKNG101-turA::Km into the MAD1 chromosome were selected on M9-0.2% citrate plates with kanamycin and streptomycin. To select for second homologous recombination events leading to both co-integrate resolution and allelic exchange, about 100 KmR SmR MAD1 co-integrate colonies were pooled, grown overnight at 30 °C in a non-selective medium, and plated in the presence of 5% sucrose and kanamycin. The resulting SucR KmR colonies were screened for pKNG101 release by streptomycin sensitivity (SmS). Finally, one such SucR SmS KmR clone was named MAD1 turA::Km. The correct replacement of the wild-type gene was assessed by PCR with the oligonucleotide pairs 5′-GGCAGGAAGCTGTGATGGATGTTGATCACC-3′/5′-GCTCAATCAATC ACCGGATCAGGGACATGG-3′ and 5′-GGTATGGCTTCTG CCAACAGCGCCTGAGCG-3′/5′-TTCCGGGACGCCGGCTGGATGGTCCTCCAG 3′, designed to probe the linkage of the ends of the KmR cassette with the chromosomal regions flanking upstream and downstream of the turA coding sequence, respectively. E. coli CC118 Pu-lacZ (5de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) carries a chromosomal Pu-lacZ fusion assembled within a streptomycin resistance mini-transposon. Plasmid pEZ9 (5de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Metzke M. Timmis K.N. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) contains the entire Pu promoter sequence as a 312-bp EcoRI-BamHI insert in pUC18, spanning positions –208 to +93. Plasmid pVLT-turA was generated for turA expression both in E. coli and in P. putida by cloning the 844-bp EcoRI-XbaI fragment of pTBA1 containing turA into the broad host range plasmid vector pVLT31 (26de Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) under control of the lacIq/Ptac pair. To obtain higher expression levels of TurA in E. coli, the 832-bp turA-containing BamHI-XbaI fragment of pTBA1 was cloned into pUC18, giving rise to pUC-turA. pACYCxylR (57Garmendia J. The Transcriptional Regulator XylR of Pseudomonas putida: Response to Aromatic Inducers and Biotechnological Applications.Ph.D thesis. Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid2001Google Scholar) is a XylR-expressing plasmid derived by cloning a 2.2-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment containing the xylR gene under the control of its native promoter into pACYC184 vector (27Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cloned inserts were verified before use by automated sequencing (MWG Biotech). Recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out according to published protocols (28Sambrook J. Russel D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Accumulation of β-galactosidase raised by lacZ fusions was measured in P. putida cells as described previously (29Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) under the conditions specified in each case. The β-galactosidase accumulation by E. coli CC118 Pu-lacZ derivatives was qualitatively evaluated through intensity of blue pigmentation upon growth on LB agar plates added with 20 μg/ml X-gal. Proteins and Protein Techniques—Crude protein extracts of the P. putida host strain KT2440 were obtained from cells of 2-liter overnight cultures in LB medium at 30 °C collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of column buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl), and disrupted in a French press device. After cell disruption, cell debris was separated from the soluble protein crude extract by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Typically, the soluble protein concentration determined by Bradford assay ranged from 5 to 15 mg/ml. For protein fractionation, about 60 mg of soluble protein were loaded onto a 3-ml HiTrap™ heparin-Sepharose™ HP chromatographic column (Amersham Biosciences). Upon loading, the column was washed with 15 ml of column buffer, and bound proteins were eluted through a 30-ml 0.1–1 m NaCl linear gradient and collected in 0.4-ml fractions. The presence of TurA was detected by standard protocols of Western blot on PROTRAN® nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) with preadsorbed anti-TurA polyclonal rabbit antibodies. The screening of the heparin chromatography fractions for Pu-interacting proteins was performed by South-Western blot as follows. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PROTRAN® membrane, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in renaturation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 5% skimmed milk, pH 7.5). After renaturation, the membrane-bound proteins were incubated for 6 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.125% skimmed milk, pH 8) added with 25 ng of a 312-bp EcoRI-BamHI Pu fragment from pEZ9, end-labeled by in-filling of the overhanging ends with Klenow and [α-32P]dATP. After incubation with the Pu probe, the membrane was washed three times with binding buffer, dried, and autoradiographed. Purified σ54 factor and integration host factor (IHF) were kindly donated by B. Magasanik and S. Goodman, respectively. Native core RNAP and σ70-RNAP were purchased from Epicenter Technology. XylRΔA, the amino-terminal A domain-deleted constitutive variant of XylR able to activate transcription from Pu in the absence of any aromatic inducer, was purified as described previously (30Pérez-Martín J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 575-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For TurA purification, E. coli DH5α strain cells harboring pUC-turA were grown overnight at 37 °C in 200 ml of LB medium, collected by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 4% glycerol, pH 6.8), and disrupted in a French press cell. Cell debris was separated from the soluble protein crude extract by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. About 600 μg of soluble proteins were separated by 15% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE and stained with Tangerine Green (Molecular Probes Inc.). Bands corresponding to TurA were cut out of the SDS-PAGE gel and eluted by incubation for 16 h at room temperature in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm DDT, and 150 mm NaCl). To remove SDS and allow renaturation, the eluted TurA protein was dialyzed in Spectra-Por Micro-DispoDialyzer tubes at 4 °C for 24 h against renaturation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol). The purity of the TurA preparation was estimated in SDS-PAGE stained with Brilliant Blue G-Colloidal Concentrate (Sigma). In Vitro Transcription Assays—The linear template for in vitro transcription of Pu promoter was obtained as a 310-bp SmaI-HincII restriction fragment from the pEZ9. In vitro transcription reactions were prepared on ice, in a total volume of 25 μl of transcription buffer containing 35 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgAc2, 70 mm KAc, 20 mm NH4Ac, 1 mm DTT. The DNA template, added at the buffer to a final concentration of 40 μm, was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 4 mm ATP, 50 nm core RNAP, 150 nm σ54, 100 nm IHF, 100 nm XylRΔA, and increasing TurA concentrations of 2, 3.5, and 7 nm, respectively. Transcription reactions were initiated by adding a mixture of ATP, CTP, GTP (400 μm each), UTP (50 μm), and [α-32P]UTP (5 μCi; 3000 Ci/mmol). After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of STOP mix containing 0.1 m EDTA and 4 m NH4Ac. Transcripts were precipitated with 20 μg of glycogen and 100 μl of ethanol, resuspended in denaturing loading buffer (7 m urea, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol in 20 mm Tris, pH 8), electrophoresed on 7% DNA sequencing gel, dried, and autoradiographed. For the RNA I transcription, pEZ9 DNA at 2 μm was incubated with 50 nm σ70-RNAP in the same reaction conditions as above. Screening for Novel Regulatory Proteins of the Host Strain P. putida KT2440 Able to Bind to the Pu Promoter of the TOL Plasmid—To identify P. putida KT2440 proteins involved in Pu co-regulation, we aimed to screen for novel Pu DNA-protein interactions by protein chromatography coupled with South-Western blotting using a radioactive Pu probe. To this end, a crude cell extract derived from an overnight culture of the TOL plasmid host strain P. putida KT2440 was fractionated through binding to a heparin affinity chromatography column, extensive washing of unbound proteins, and elution with 0.1–1 m NaCl linear gradient. Samples of the ∼70 chromatographic fractions collected along the elution gradient were analyzed by South-Western blotting with end-labeled DNA fragments bearing the entire Pu sequence spanning from –208 to +93 with respect to the transcription start site. Fig. 1 shows the results of this screening procedure, conducted on protein fractions eluted from the heparin column by concentrations of NaCl ranging from ∼0.82 to 0.95 m. Among the proteins of these fractions, a strong hybridization signal coincided with a protein band present in the fractions 61–67, corresponding to a protein species of about 15 kDa (Fig. 1A). To retest the results obtained in this first round of screening, the proteins of fraction 66 were analyzed again by South-Western blotting with end-labeled Pu DNA. In this case, as we wanted to obtain better resolution than before in a range of molecular masses lower than 20 kDa, proteins were separated by more resolutive SDS-PAGE for a longer period of time. As shown in Fig. 1B, this procedure confirmed that the Pu DNA could interact with a protein species of about 15 kDa. However, the 15-kDa band of Fig. 1A could be resolved into two protein species of very similar molecular weights, which we initially called P15 and P16, respectively. It is interesting to note that P16 alone could interact efficiently with labeled Pu DNA in a South-Western blotting assay (Fig. 1B). Identification and in Silico Analysis of TurA Protein—The amino acid sequence of P16 amino-terminal end was determined, searched through the KT2440 deduced protein data base at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Comprehensive Microbial Resource (31Peterson J.D. Umayam L.A. Dickinson T. Hickey E.K. White O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 32Nelson K.E. Weinel C. Paulsen I.T. Dodson R.J. Hilbert H.

Microbiol. 2002; 4: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), and found at the aminoterminal of a small deduced protein of 125 amino acids, accession number PP1366, annotated as sharing a high degree of similarity with the transcriptional regulator MvaT, P16 subunit (33Rosenthal R.S. Rodwell V.W. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Standard BLAST search (34Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar) also found in KT2440 genome four open reading frames (loci PP3765, PP0017, PP3693, PP2947, respectively) that code for protein paralogues of P16. Furthermore, P16 orthologue proteins, organized in paralogue pairs, can be also found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens genomes. No significant sequence similarity in bacterial species not belonging to the genus Pseudomonas was found. To extend our search of similarities from primary to tertiary structure, we adopted predictive software packages able to detect structural similarity between a query protein and experimentally determined structural domains. Firstly, preliminary architecture domain analysis of P16 both by SMART server and by COILS program (35Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar, 36Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P.

Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3488) Google Scholar) predicted a structure that resembled the E. coli nucleoid-associated protein H-NS. Secondly, the combined use of ORFeus, a profile-profile comparison program (38Ginalski K. Pas J. Wyrwicz L.S. von Grotthuss M. Bujnicki J.M. Rychlewski L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3804-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and PSI-BLAST search (39Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60532) Google Scholar) validated the structural similarity between the P16 protein and the cluster of orthologous groups (COGs) COG2916 (40Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar), which was annotated as an H-NS-like protein family. Thirdly, this structural similarity was further confirmed by confident transitive similarity searches conducted with ORFeus on protein families extracted from Part B of the Pfam data base (41Bateman A. Birney E. Cerruti L. Durbin R. Etwiller L. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S. Howe K.L. Marshall M. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar). Since the data presented (see below) strongly indicated that P16 protein binds to the Pu promoter and represses its activity, we called P16 “TOL upper operon repressor A” (TurA). The amino acid sequence of P15 amino-terminal end was also determined. Interestingly, it corresponded to the amino-terminal of P16 paralogue PP3765 (see above). This could explain the tight similarity of molecular weights and elution profiles in heparin affinity chromatography, respectively, between P15 and P16. Inactivation of the PP3765 gene did not influence Pu activity (data not shown). However, by analogy with TurA, we named P15 TurB. Deficiency of TurA Protein Causes an Increase in Pu Promoter Activity at the End of the Exponential Silencing Phase—To determine the role of TurA protein in Pu regulation, we generated, by kanamycin-resistance (KmR) cassette insertion, the knock-out mutant allele of the turA gene in the P. putida KT2442 derivative strain MAD1 (KT2442::Pu-lacZ, xylR+), which harbors both a Pu-lacZ transcriptional fusion and a xylR gene stably integrated in the chromosome (23Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martín J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the comparison of β-galactosidase accumulation by MAD1 and MAD1 turA::KmR strains, respectively, when cultured in rich LB medium, with and without toluene induction. Growth in LB medium in the absence of an inducer resulted in no or very low, basal expression of Pu (23Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martín J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the case of the toluene-supplemented cultures, both induction curves, wild-type and mutant, displayed the typical exponential silencing phenomenon, consisting of very low levels of Pu activity during exponential growth followed by rapid induction at the onset of the stationary phase (12Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martín J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, in terms of the magnitude of the Pu expression after the exponential silencing, MAD1 and MAD1 turA::KmR behaved differently. In fact, after exponential silencing, the expression curves of MAD1 and MAD1 turA::KmR diverged consistently, with levels of β-galactosidase accumulation three times higher in the mutant strain. Thus, the deficiency of TurA protein revealed unexpected repression on Pu that appeared to be different from the exponential silencing phenomenon described previously (12Cases I. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martín J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test whether TurA might be involved in the regulatory cascade behind the carbon catabolite repression exerted by glucose on Pu that was shown to be distinct from Pu exponential silencing (11Cases I. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Cases I. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Biol.

We find that rupture of the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga thrust fault system is unlikely to trigger rupture of the San Andreas or San Jacinto strike-slip faults. However, a large northern San Jacinto fault earthquake could trigger a cascading rupture of the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga system, potentially causing a moment magnitude 7.5 to 7.8 earthquake on the edge of the Los Angeles metropolitan region."
https://openalex.org/W2026814802,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Smads, a group of functionally and structurally related intracellular effectors, mediate signaling initiated by BMPs and regulate cell definite commitment. Previously, we showed that Smad1 activates osteopontin and osteoprotegerin gene expression by dislodging Hoxc-8 from its DNA binding sites. A domain of Smad1, termed Smad1C, was characterized as interacting with Hoxc-8 and then crippling its DNA-binding ability. Ectopic expression of Smad1C is able to bypass BMP signaling in the induction of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vitro. To test the function of Smad1C on osteogenesis in vivo, we generated transgenic mice in which Smad1C expression was induced with doxycycline and localized in bone by using a tetracycline-inducible expression system (Tet-on) modified with a bone-specific gene promoter, type I collagen α1. The mice expressing Smad1C showed increased skeletal bone mineral density compared with their littermates. Bone histomorphometric analysis of mouse tibiae showed that Smad1C significantly increases trabecular bone area and length of trabecular surface covered with osteoid and up-regulates bone marker gene (OPN, Cbfa1, Col I α1, BSP, ALP) expression in vivo. Moreover, stromal cells isolated from mice expressing Smad1C displayed a higher potential for differentiating into osteoblasts than the other mice. These results indicate that Smad1C mimics BMPs in the induction of osteogenesis in vivo. Most important, using a high throughput screening assay based on mimicking Smad1C's displacement of Hoxc-8 binding to DNA, we identified chemical entities that exhibit bone anabolic activity in cell and bone organ cultures, suggesting the possibility that the compounds may be used as bone anabolic agents to treat bone pathologies.

Osteoporosis is a public health care problem that affects approximately 30 million people in the United States alone. It is an aging-related disease of bone loss, and the problem is becoming more serious as the elderly population increases. Despite recent successes with drugs that inhibit bone resorption, there is a clear need for anabolic agents that will substantially increase bone formation in people who have already suffered substantial bone loss.

BMPs trigger signaling in their target cells through interaction with their receptors (BMP receptor I and II) and then by activating kinase activity of the receptors. Activated receptors subsequently transfer signaling by phosphorylating a series of mediators, such as Smads, which among others represent a family of structurally and functionally related molecules. According to their hierarchy in the signaling cascade, the Smads are classified into three groups: BMP receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), including Smad1, -5, and -8, and transforming growth factor-β-activin receptor-regulated Smad2 and -3; co-Smad, or Smad4, which heterooligomerizes with activated R-Smads; and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads), Smad6 and -7, which, as negative feedback modulators, antagonize the signals (1Hoodless P.A.

We found that Smad1 activated osteopontin gene transcription by means of dislodging Hoxc-8 from the promoter in response to BMP signaling (13Kim J.Y. Mochizuki T. Akita K. Jung H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Hoxc-8 belongs to a highly conserved hox gene family and expresses in limbs, backbone rudiments, the neural tube of mouse mid-gestation embryos, and in the cartilage and skeleton of newborns (15Shimamoto T.

Gene Expr. Patterns. 2002; 2: 5-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Skeletal abnormalities have been observed in mice with Hoxc-8-null mutation. Mapping the domains interacting with Hoxc-8, we discovered that two regions located on the MH1 and MH1 linker boundary, respectively, were involved (19Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). One of them, termed Smad1C, spanning from the COOH terminus of MH1 to the linker region (amino acids 145–278) imitates BMP-activated Smad1 in the stimulation of osteopontin gene expression. Ectopic expression of Smad1C linked with a nuclear translocation sequence in 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells stimulated osteoblast differentiation-related gene expression and led to mineralized bone matrix formation (14Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Wan M. Shi X. Feng X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10119-10125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the function of Smad1C on osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vivo. Using a modified tetracycline-inducible system (Tet-on), we have created transgenic mice in which Smad1C expression localizes specifically in bone in the presence of doxycycline. The mice expressing Smad1C displayed elevated bone mineral densities and enhanced trabecular bone formation. Most important, we attempted to search for small molecules that could mimic Smad1 in respect to the inhibition of Hoxc-8 binding to the target gene promoter and result in stimulation of bone formation (21Emery J.G. Ohlstein E.H. Jaye M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Dirr M.J. Roof S.L.d Cook J.S. Cao X. Axelrod D.W. Ji D.X. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: S462Google Scholar). Using a high throughput screening assay, we have identified compounds that displace Hoxc-8 from DNA binding and induce osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in organ culture. Transgene Construction and Generation of Transgenic Mice—A Tet-on system with pTet-on and pTRE was purchased from Clontech. The promoter of type I collagen (α1p) from -2300 to +115 was released from collagen type I dominant-negative BMP receptor type 1B (23Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and inserted upstream of the reverse tetracycline-responsive transcriptional activators (rtTA) to replace the cytomegalovirus promoter in pTet-on. The construct was termed α1p-tet-on. The Smad1C fragment with FLAG tagged on the NH2 terminal and NLS (nuclear localization sequence), which was isolated from pCMV5B-FLAG-Smad1C-NLS, on the COOH terminus was cloned downstream of the tetracycline-responsive promoter of pTRE, and the construct was named pTRE-Smad1C. Polyadenylation signals of the transgenes (α1p-rtTA), α1p, rtTA, and SV40 were released from the vector α1p-tet-on with digestion of XhoI and SapI unique restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the transgene; whereas the integrity of the polyadenylation signals of transgenes carrying the tetracycline-responsive promoter Smad1C and SV40 were liberated from the vector pTRE-Smad1C via EcoRI and BamHI digestion. The transgenic DNA fragments were microinjected into mouse (C57BL/6XSJL) eggs and surgically transferred to recipients by standard techniques. Tail tips were cut from pups at 2 weeks old and digested in homogenizing solution (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) at 55 °C for 12 h. Genomic DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform. Genotyping of transgenic mice was carried out by PCR. Specific primers were designed for amplification of rtTA and FLAG-Smad1C-NLS. To amplify rtTA, the forward primer was 5′-ACAAGGTTTTTCACTAGAGAACGCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-AGATCGAAATCGTCTAGCGCGTCG-3′. To amplify FLAG-Smad1C-NLS, the forward primer was 5′-GGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACA-3′, corresponding to the sequence of FLAG, and the reverse primer was 5′-TTTGGTTCCTCATAAGCAACCG-3′, corresponding to the sequence of NLS to distinguish the transgene from endogenous Smad1. The transgenic founders were then back-crossed with C57/B6, and the offspring of α1p-rtTA were bred with the offspring of Smad1C mice to activate expression of Smad1C specifically in bone. To induce Smad1C expression, 200 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) was given in drinking water bottles containing 2.5% sucrose and wrapped with aluminum foil. The water containing Dox was changed every 3 days to avoid precipitation. Extraction of Total RNA and mRNA from Bone—To determine expression of the transgene as well as the bone marker gene, femurs and tibiae were isolated from the mice, wrapped with aluminum foil, and immediately inserted in liquid nitrogen. Bones were pulverized using a hammer in the presence of liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder was placed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and homogenized with a cell homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instruction. The mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the Oligotex mRNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., CA). Analysis of the Expression of Transgenes and Osteogenesis-related Genes using Real-time RT-PCR—To examine the expression of rtTA and Smad1C, real-time RT-PCR (Access RT PCR System; Promega Co., Madison, WI) was performed using mRNA isolated from bone following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The primers used for RT-PCR were the same as those used in the genotyping described above, whereas PCR were carried out using mRNA samples to confirm no DNA contamination. As a control, the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified from the RNA samples by RT-PCR. The forward primer was 5′-CTCATGACCACAGTCCATGC-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-GGCATTGCTCTCAATGACAA-3′. To examine physiological change in the expression of bone marker genes in mice expressing Smad1C versus their littermates, a relative RT-PCR quantification based on the ratio of the target gene to the housekeeping gene (β-actin) was used. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, Co., La Jolla, CA). Primer sequences for each gene are listed in Table I.Table IPrimer sequences for each geneGenesForward (5′-3′)Reverse (5′-3′)Collα1TCTGGTCCTCGTGGTCTCCCCTTCCCCATCATCACCATTCCbfa1GATGACACTGCCACCTCTGAATGAAATGCTTGGGACTGCOPNTGCACCCAGATCCTATAGCCTGTGGTCATGGCTTTCATTGBSPGAAGCAGGTGCAGAAGGAACACTCAACGGTGCTGCTTTTTALPGCTCAACACCATGTAGCCATATGTCTTGGAGAGGGCCACβ-actinAACACCCCAGCCATGTACGTAGGTGTTGGCATAGAGGTCTTTACGG Open table in a new tab Real-time PCR was performed in a LightCycler apparatus using LC-Fast Start Reaction mix SYBR green I (MJ Research, Co., Reno, NV) as described (24Yin J.L.

Briefly, a cDNA standard for each gene was prepared by PCR amplification run to saturation (35 PCR cycles), using corresponding cDNA and primers. Different amounts of cDNA standard were used in the reactions to establish a standard curve to calibrate the amount of the identical gene in samples. After PCR amplification, a melting curve was constructed to ensure identity of the product. To ensure that the correct product was amplified in the reaction, all samples were further separated by 2% agarose. The relative expression of the target gene was calculated by dividing its amount by the quantity of β-actin from the same sample. Osteogenesis Induction of Stromal Cells Isolated from Transgenic Mice—Bone marrow cells were obtained from 3-month-old adult transgenic mice by flushing the lumen of the femur shaft with 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's low glucose medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then cultured in modified Eagle's low glucose medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After a 4-h incubation, non-adherent cells were removed by replacing the medium (25Pereira R.F. O'Hara M.D. Laptev A.V. Halford K.W. Pollard M.D. Class R. Simon D. Livezey K. Prockop D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1142-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 26Prockop D.J. Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar). The adherent cells were cultured for 48 h and then cultured in the medium with osteogenic supplements (100 nm dexamethasone, 0.05 mm l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate, and 10 mm glycerophosphate) plus 2 mg/ml doxycycline for 15 days. Staining Cells with Immunofluorescence-conjugated Antibodies—To determine the Smad1C expression at the protein level, osteoblasts differentiated in vitro, as described above, were immunoblotted with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as described previously (27Wang Y.J. Wang J. Sun H.Q. Martinez M. Sun Y.X. Macia E. Kirchhausen T. Albanesi J.P. Roth M.G. Yin H.L. Cell. 2003; 114: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently blotted with monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (Sigma). The cells were then incubated with the second antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate against mouse IgG. Alkaline Phosphatase and Mineralized Bone Matrix Formation Assays—Bone cell differentiation was monitored using an alkaline phosphatase assay (28Begley C.T. Doherty M.J. Hankey D.P. Wilson D.J. Bone (N. Y.). 1993; 14: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the von Kossa stain of mineralized bone matrix (29Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with 10% formalin buffered with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh substrate solution (one tablet of Sigma Fast BCIP/NBT (p-nitrophenol phosphate B5655) in 10 ml of H2O) for 30 min at 25 °C. The reaction was inactivated by rinsing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm EDTA. For von Kossa staining, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with formalin, and stained with 2% silver nitrate and 1% acid fuchsin as described (29Bellows C.G. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Antosz M.E. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 38: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Secretion of calcified extracellular matrix was observed as black nodules with von Kossa staining. Images were obtained with an IX70 Inverted Research Microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) and MagnaFire SP imaging software (Optronics, Goleta, CA). Analysis of Bone Densities of Transgenic Mice—To assess the effect of ectopic expression of Smad1C on osteogenesis in transgenic mice, bone mineral density (BMD) was examined using the PIXImus bone densitometer (GE-Lunar, Madison, WI) as described (30Nagy T.R. Clair A.L. Obes. Res. 2000; 8: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a prostrate position. Total body bone mineral content and density as well as body composition (percentages of fat and lean) were determined on the post-cranial body as previously described (30Nagy T.R. Clair A.L. Obes. Res. 2000; 8: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Histomorphometric Analysis—Mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The right tibiae were removed by dissection, cleaned of soft tissues, and fixed in 10% formalin with phosphate-buffered saline for 48 h. Each undecalcified right tibia was embedded in methylmethacrylate (Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ). Midline longitudinal sections of tibiae were stained with von Kossa (10 μm, mainly for mineralized bone tissue) and toluidine blue (5 μm, for non-mineralized bone or osteoid tissue). Images were obtained with an IX70 Inverted Research Microscope (Olympus America Inc., Melville, NY) and MagnaFire SP imaging software (Optronics, Goleta, CA). Culture of Murine Calvarial Bone—The calvaria from 4-day-old pups of Swiss white mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were excised, dissected free of adjacent connective tissue, and cut in half along the sagittal suture. Each half of the calvaria was placed on a stainless steel grid in a 12-well tissue culture dish containing 1 ml of Biggers-Gwatkin-Judah tissue culture medium (Sigma) with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with test compounds for 3–7 days. The amount of new bone formation was then assessed histomorphometrically as described previously (31Traianedes K. Dallas M.R. Garrett I.R. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3178-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Generation of Transgenic Mice in which Expression of Smad1C, Exclusively in Bone, Is Induced with Doxycycline—To examine the effects of the Smad1C-Hoxc-8 interaction domain (14Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) on bone formation in mice, using a tetracycline-inducible expression system we made transgenic mice in which Smad1C expression is specifically localized in bone cells and its induction is under the control of doxycycline. To get Smad1C tissue-specific expression, the cytomegalovirus promoter in the pTet-on vector was replaced with bone-specific mouse type I collagen α promoter from -2300 to +115 bp (α1p) (23Zhao M. Harris S.E. Horn D. Geng Z. Nishimura R. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1049-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Smad1C with FLAG tagged on its NH2 terminus and NLS flanked to the COOH terminal was inserted downstream of the rtTA-regulated promoter (Fig. 1A). Transgenes of α1p-rtTA, including α1p, rtTA, and SV40 polyadenylation signal, and Smad1C with tetracycline-responsive promoter Smad1C and SV40 polyadenylation signal were isolated from corresponding constructs and then injected separately into fertilized mouse eggs. Eleven founders were generated from α1p-rtTA transgene injections and four founders from the Smad1C transgene. All of them transmitted the transgene at the expected Mendelian ratio. The assessment of expression of rtTA in the bone was performed by RT-PCR. At the same time, a PCR assay was carried out using mRNA samples to confirm no DNA contamination. We checked three lines of α1p-rtTA (rtTA-28, rtTA-38, and rtTA-24) and all of them expressed rtTA in bone (Fig. 1B). To obtain mice with both α1p-rtTA and Smad1C, the transgenic mice from rtTA-38 were bred with one line of transgenic mice with Smad1C (Smad1C-II). Genotypes of the offspring were determined using PCR, and mice with different genotypes were fed with doxycycline in sugar water or placebo (sugar water). The expression of Smad1C in the offspring was examined by RT-PCR using specific primers derived from a sequence of FLAG and NLS (Fig. 1C). As can be seen, mRNA of Smad1C is detected only in the binary transgenic mice (α1p-rtTA/Smad1C) fed with Dox. Double-transgenic α1p-rtTA/TRE-Smad1C mice, in the absence of Dox and any single transgenic mice (either α1p-rtTA or Smad1C) fed with doxycycline, do not show any noticeable Smad1C expression. The results of PCR indicate that there is no DNA contamination in the above RNA samples. To check whether Smad1C expression is restricted to bone, mRNA was isolated from other tissues including lung, liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, heart, and skin and subjected to RT-PCR analysis. No perceptible Smad1C was detected in these tissues (Fig. 1D). To test the protein expression of Smad1C, we isolated stroma cells from transgenic mice, cultured them in osteogenic differentiation medium for 10 days, and immunostained them with monoclonal antibodies against FLAG (Fig. 1E). The protein of Smad1C was detected only in cells with dual transgenes in the presence of Dox. Smad1C Stimulates Osteoblast Differentiation in Vivo—Previously, we observed that the stable expression of Smad1C in 2T3 osteoblast precursor cells stimulated osteoblast differentiation marker gene expression and led to mineralized bone matrix formation, indicating that the interaction between Smad1C and Hoxc-8 mimics BMP signaling and is sufficient to induce osteoblast differentiation (14Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To verify the effect of Smad1C on osteoblast differentiation in mice, we isolated bone marrow stromal cells from Smad1C transgenic as well as Hoxc-8 transgenic mice. The alkaline phosphatase activity was examined and deposition of mineralized extracellular matrix containing hydroxyapatite was measured by von Kossa staining. Enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and mineral stain were observed in cells expressing Smad1C (Fig. 2, middle and lower panels). Cells expressing Hoxc-8 that were exposed to a osteogenic medium for 10 days remained in the undifferentiated stage, whereas the others, especially the cells expressing Smad1C, displayed the most mature osteoblastic morphology characterized as cuboidal and plump (Fig. 2, upper panel). Taken together, our results indicate that Smad1C can mimic BMP signals in the regulation of osteogenesis in the mouse. To further investigate the effect of Smad1C on osteoblast differentiation, the expression level of osteoblast marker genes in femoral and tibial bone tissue of transgenic mice was examined with RT-PCR. The relative expression level of each marker gene was determined by dividing the level of marker gene expression with that of β-actin from the same sample. Comparing single and dual transgenic mice without Dox stimulation, the expression of all these marker genes was enhanced to some extent by Smad1C expression whereas Hoxc-8 inhibited the expression (Fig. 3). The phenomena are consistent with the in vitro cell differentiation assay (14Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and histomorphometric data (Fig. 4.), as well as with a previous study (14Yang X. Ji X. Shi X. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The variation in the level of bone marker gene expression between Smad1C dual transgenic and Hoxc-8 dual transgenic mice suggests that Smad1C enhances bone constitution through binding to Hoxc-8 and then impairing its function.Fig. 4Histomorphometric analysis of the proximal tibiae of transgenic mice. A, toluidine blue stained the mineralized bone light purple (appears white here), osteoid pale blue, and mineralized front light blue (magnification, ×40). Much thicker trabeculae and more osteoid-covered trabecular surface were observed in tibiae from rtTA/Smad1C dual transgenic mice fed with Dox. The plump, cuboidal osteoblasts along the osteoid-covered trabecular surface were much easier to observe in tissue sections from this group. B, secretion of calcified extracellular matrix was observed as black with von Kossa staining (B, magnification ×2 and C, magnification ×10). More densely distributed, thicker trabeculae were found in epiphyseal and metaphyseal sections from tibiae of dual transgenic mice fed with Dox than in those from other control groups (B and C), which was more evident in C.

https://openalex.org/W2093053203,"By measuring the phosphorylation levels of individual proteolytic fragments of SERCA1a separated by electrophoresis after their phosphorylation, we were able to study the catalytic properties of a p95C-p14N complex arising from SERCA1a cleavage by proteinase K between Leu119 and Lys120, in the loop linking the A-domain with the second transmembrane segment. ATP hydrolysis by the complex was very strongly inhibited, although ATP-dependent phosphorylation and the conversion of the ADP-sensitive E1P form to E2P still occurred at appreciable rates. However, the rate of subsequent dephosphorylation of E2P was inhibited to a dramatic extent, and this was also the case for the rate of “backdoor” formation of E2P from E2 and Pi. E2P formation from E2 at equilibrium nevertheless indicated little change in the apparent affinity for Pi or Mg2+, while binding of orthovanadate was weaker. The p95C-p14N complex also had a slightly reduced affinity for Ca2+ and exhibited a reduced rate for its Ca2+-dependent transition from E2 to Ca2E1. Thus, disruption of the N-terminal link of the A-domain with the transmembrane region seems to shift the conformational equilibria of Ca2+-ATPase from the E1/E1P toward the E2/E2P states and to increase the activation energy for dephosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase, reviving the old idea of the A-domain being a phosphatase domain as part of the transduction machinery.

Large scale relative movements of the three main sub-domains in the cytosolic head of P-type ATPases, as well as associated movements of the transmembrane segments to which these domains are connected, probably play a major role in the active transport mediated by these membrane proteins (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). We have therefore become interested in the functional effects of proteolytic disruption of the integrity of the loops connecting these various ATPase domains.

Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In that previous work, the proteolysis conditions had allowed us to obtain relatively large (milligram) amounts of fairly pure “p83C-p28N” peptide complexes, derived from ATPase by excision of a short 239MAATE243 sequence from this segment, and procedures that previously had been developed to study the catalytic cycle of intact ATPase were used unaltered to study the properties of the proteolytic product. The results showed that the cleaved ATPase was deficient in Ca2+ transport but remained phosphorylatable by ATP in a manner indistinguishable from that of intact ATPase. A detailed study of the partial reactions revealed that a major defect resulting from proteolysis was the difficulty for the cleaved ATPase to enter what is known as the “E2P” state, i.e. the ADP-insensitive form of phosphoenzyme. In the present work, we have aimed at studying whether SERCA1a function is affected by proteolytic cleavage in another part of the link between the A-domain and the membrane. To do so, we again resorted to proteolytic attack by proteinase K, but instead of performing the proteolysis in the presence of Ca2+ and AMP-PCP, we now treated the ATPase in the absence of Ca2+ and nucleotide: this is known to allow cleavage at Leu119-Lys120, in the segment linking the A-domain with the second transmembrane segment, resulting in the formation of complementary “p14N” and “p95C” peptides (4Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this case, however, proteolysis also simultaneously occurs at other sites, so that a mixture of peptides is formed, among which p95C is only present in relatively small amounts compared with p83C or residual intact ATPase. To study the catalytic properties of the “p95C-p14N” complex, we therefore had to resort to new procedures. We combined two types of established experiments: first, after phosphorylation of the various peptides, we separated them by electrophoresis under conditions previously found to allow adequate separation between fragments of large size and yet minimize dephosphorylation (5Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); second, we made use of various phosphorylation and dephosphorylation protocols previously used to characterize kinetically the individual steps in the catalytic cycle of heterologously expressed ATPase mutants. This allowed us to simultaneously study to what extent the p95C and the p83C peptides were phosphorylated or dephosphorylated under various situations and to compare their properties with those of residual intact ATPase. Results concerning the p83C-p28N complex were consistent with those that we had previously obtained with conventional methods (3Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C.

The present report therefore focuses on the catalytic properties of the p95C-p14N complex resulting from cleavage of the Lys119-Leu120 bond: we find that following this cleavage Ca2+-ATPase turnover is severely perturbed but in a manner quite different from that obtained by excision of the 239MAATE243 sequence in the peptide chain linking the A-domain with M3. The results make it possible to get a better understanding of the role of the A-domain for the intermediary processes involved in Ca2+ transport. Proteolysis by Proteinase K—For controlled proteolysis of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase, SR membranes (6Champeil P. Guillain F. Vénien C. Gingold M.P. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) were suspended at a concentration of 2 mg protein/ml in a 100 mm Mops-NaOH medium (pH 6.5) containing 5 mm Mg2+ and 0.5 mm EGTA, and treated with PK at 0.03 mg/ml, generally for 15 min at 20 °C unless otherwise indicated. Proteolysis was stopped by adding 0.5 or 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (as well as 0.6 mm Ca2+ in some cases) and storing the samples on ice for 10 min. For some of the phosphorylation experiments, namely those involving [γ-32P]ATP, the preparation with inactivated PK was used without further treatment as detailed below. For other phosphorylation experiments, namely those involving [32P]Pi that were best performed with a higher concentration of protein than those involving [γ-32P]ATP, a large batch of PK-treated concentrated membranes was first prepared (see Supplemental Material). Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation—Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP of ATPase fragments was generally measured on ice, by adding 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP (at 0.5 mCi/μmol) to PK-treated membranes suspended at 0.2 mg/ml in buffer A (100 mm KCl, 5 mm Mg2+, and 50 mm Mops-Tris, adjusted to pH 7.0 at room temperature), supplemented with various concentrations of Ca2+ (or a Ca2+/EGTA buffer) (typically 600 μl per sample). When desired, ATPase dephosphorylation was subsequently triggered by adding EGTA and the appropriate additive, with only small dilution (see below for details). In some cases, phosphorylation was also measured after a few milliseconds reaction at 20 °C, with a Biologic QFM5 quenched-flow apparatus (48Henao F. de Foresta B. Orlowski S. Cuenda A. Gutiérrez-Merino C. Champeil P Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation from [32P]Pi of ATPase fragments was measured by adding [32P]Pi (at 0.5 mCi/μmol), generally at 200 μm, to concentrated PK-treated membranes suspended at 1–2 mg/ml in buffer B (10 mm Mg2+, 1 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Mops-Tris, adjusted to pH 7.0, at room temperature) supplemented with 25% Me2SO (v/v) (typically 60 μl per sample). When desired, ATPase dephosphorylation was then triggered either by adding excess non-radioactive Pi (resulting in only little dilution; experiments of this kind were performed at 20 °C), or by 10-fold dilution of the phosphorylated sample into an Me2SO-free, KCl-containing, and ATP-containing buffer (experiments of this kind were performed on ice, see below). In all cases the reaction was stopped by acid quenching with trichloroacetic acid (or in some cases PCA) and phosphoric acid, at final concentrations of 500 mm and 30 mm, respectively (typically in a total volume of 900 μl). Generally, the quenched sample, previously left on ice for 20 min, was pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 25 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was sucked off and replaced by an equivalent volume of acid solution (diluted 10-fold compared with the final quenching solution), and the sample was centrifuged as before. After removal of the second supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of a sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm Tris-HCl (at pH 6.8), 16% (v/v) glycerol (or 8 m urea in some cases), 0.8 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue, by vortexing for 1 min (thorough vortexing was found to be critical for reproducible resuspension of the acid-treated pellet); 20-μl aliquots were then loaded onto gel for electrophoretic separation as described below. Electrophoretic Separation and 32P Counting—This was performed according to protocols previously described (5Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G. J. Biol.

The stacking gel contained 4% acrylamide (with an acrylamide to bisacrylamide ratio of 29 to 1), 65 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 5.5, 0.1% SDS, 2% ammonium persulfate, and 0.1% TEMED. The separating gel was a continuous 7% gel, containing 65 mm Tris-H3PO4, pH 6.5, 0.1% SDS, 0.4% ammonium persulfate, and 0.05% TEMED. Unless otherwise indicated, gels were run in a cold room. The pre-cooled running buffer contained 170 mm Mops-Tris, pH 6.0 and 0.1% SDS; it was kept under stirring during electrophoresis to prevent heating of the gels. Electrophoresis lasted about 3 h, with a current intensity set constant to 10 mA/gel (70–80 V). Gels were then stained and fixed for 10 min in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250. Destaining was carried out in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, and 1% glycerol within less than 1 h, and the gels were then dried overnight between two sheets of cellophane paper, prior to exposure to a phosphor screen the next morning. Radioactivity was revealed with a STORM 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by comparison with known amounts of [γ-32P]ATP or [32P]Pi. In some cases, samples were also run in a Laemmli-type system (e.g. see Fig. A in Supplemental Material). This was especially the case for simple immuno-decoration experiments, performed as previously described (3Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P.

Solubilization and Elution of the p95C-p14N Complex in the Presence of Detergent—After proteolysis, solubilization with C12E8 or DM was sometimes performed and followed by chromatography on a detergent-equilibrated size exclusion column, essentially as previously described (e.g. Refs. 3Møller J.V.

Selected fractions were used for SDS-PAGE and immuno-reactivity analysis (see Supplemental Material), whereas other aliquots were used for MALDI-TOF analysis (see below) of p14N, either without further separation, or after additional trypsinolysis (12) (see Supplemental Material). Mass Spectrometry Analysis—After sample preparation (see Supplemental Material), spectra were acquired on a MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Perseptive Biosystems, Voyager STR-DE) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm), in linear mode or in reflector mode (see Supplemental Material). Edman Degradation Analysis and Other Methods—After SDS-PAGE separation of PK-treated fragments on an 8% Laemmli gel (with 1 mm thioglycolate in the running buffer), the N terminus of the blotted p95C fragments was sequenced using a Procise (Applied Biosystems) protein sequencer. Low concentrations of free Ca2+ were obtained by buffering with EGTA, using the following apparent dissociation constants for Ca2+ and Mg2+ at pH 7: KdCa·EGTA ∼ 0.4 μm and KdMg·EGTA ∼ 25 mm. Structures were visualized using the SwissPDB Viewer (Ref. 13Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar; available at www.expasy.org/spdbv/).

Multiple Fragmentation of Ca2+-ATPase Treated with PK: Formation of a p95C-p14N Complex in the Absence of Ca2+and Assay of Phosphorylatable Proteolytic Peptides with Sarkadi Gels—The typical pattern of ATPase proteolysis by PK in the presence or absence of Ca2+, as deduced from electrophoresis on Laemmli gels, is shown in the top panel of Fig. 1, lanes 2–5 in this panel show that, as previously documented, treatment of SR vesicles with PK in the presence of Ca2+ gives rise to a number of well characterized initial products, comprising membranous peptides derived from either the N-terminal (p28N) or the C-terminal part (p83C and p19C) of the ATPase, together with water-soluble p29/30 fragments derived from the central nucleotide binding domain (4Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol.

In the absence of Ca2+, fragments with the same apparent masses as the p83C and p28N bands again show up (lanes 6–9 in Fig. 1A), but in this case a new band with a higher molecular mass, the “p95” peptide is also transiently formed in the first 15 min, together with a new p14 band; both p95C and p14N bands are degraded after 60 min (compare lanes 6–9 with lanes 2–5, and see similar results in Refs. 4Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This p95 band represents a C-terminal peptide that previously was found to arise from ATPase cleavage at Leu119-Lys120 (4Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and by Edman degradation analysis we confirmed herein this assignment (data not shown). Thus, the absence of Ca2+ appears to result in an increased susceptibility of the ATPase chain to PK cleavage at Leu119-Lys120. For convenience, the bottom part of Fig. 1 (adapted from Fig. 3 in Ref. 4Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) recalls the position of the main identified cleavage points on Ca2+-ATPase, as well as some of the resulting peptides.Fig. 3Phosphorylation from [32P]Pi of the p95C-p14N complex occurs with quasi-normal affinity for Pi, and inhibition by Ca2+ is slightly less pronounced. PK-treated and resuspended membranes were incubated for 15 min in buffer B supplemented with 25% Me2SO and either 1 mm EGTA and various concentrations of [32P]Pi (lanes 2–5), or 200 μm [32P]Pi and various concentrations of free Ca2+ (resulting in the pCa indicated, lanes 5–9). Lanes 1 and 10 contained molecular mass markers (“low molecular weight,” LMW). Panel A shows the PhosphorImager scan. From this scan and from the Coomassie Blue staining ability of the various bands (not shown), we computed the relative ability of the various bands to retain 32P (panel B), taking the phosphorylation level of intact ATPase at pCa 8.7 and 200 μm Pi as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For functional studies, the question whether the complementary p14N and p95C fragments arising from the above-described cleavage remain associated in the membrane is an important issue. To address this question, after treatment with PK we solubilized the treated SR membranes with a mild detergent (C12E8 or DM) and chromatographed the solubilized sample on an high-performance liquid chromatography size exclusion column equilibrated in the presence of the same detergent. By both Western blotting and Coomassie Blue staining, we found that the small p14N peptide indeed elutes at the position where monomeric intact ATPase normally elutes, and where, after PK treatment, the p83C-p28N complex resulting for cleavage at Thr242-Glu243 also elutes together with residual intact ATPase (3Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar): i.e. p14N presumably elutes in association with the larger p95C peptide (Fig. B in Supplemental Material). Furthermore, judging from Coomassie Blue staining, p95C and p14N are present in these fractions (corresponding to the “monomeric” region of the elution pattern) in relative amounts consistent with the formation of stoichiometric complexes (Fig. C in Supplemental Material), suggesting that the two ATPase fragments resulting from cleavage at Leu119-Lys120 remain closely associated despite the presence of detergent, as was previously demonstrated for the p83C and p28N fragments (3Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore consider it likely that the former fragments also remain associated in the membrane after cleavage, hence our designation of these fragments in the remainder of this paper as a p95C-p14N complex. We checked that after cleavage in the absence of Ca2+, the N-terminal peptide formed, p14N, does have its C-terminal end at Leu119, i.e. that proteinase K has not cleaved off a few more residues on the C-terminal side of this peptide as we previously found to be the case for the p83C-p28N complex. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the 1–119 peptide was indeed not subject to further degradation (Fig. D in Supplemental Material) (and simultaneously confirmed that, as previously established (16Tong S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the N terminus of Ca2+-ATPase is acetylated). The identity of the p14N fragment is thus fully established. Note that this p14N fragment, formed after cleavage in the absence of Ca2+, was previously designated as p14a in Ref. 4Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20123-20134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar (and, in the legend to Table I of that report, it was erroneously indicated that this peptide corresponded to residues 1–19, instead of 1–119). After treatment with PK for 15 min in the absence of Ca2+, the amount of the p95C-p14N complex formed is somewhat smaller than that of undegraded ATPase and definitely smaller than the amount of p83C-p28N complex; after longer proteolysis periods, secondary cleavage sites evidently result in further degradation of the primary products (see lane 9 in Fig. 1, and Fig. E in Supplemental Material). To study phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase fragments, we have adopted a moderately acidic gel electrophoresis system that previously has been described not only to retain the ability to resolve protein fragments of relatively similar molecular masses as efficiently as the Laemmli system, but also to allow phosphorylated P-type ATPases or fragments to remain phosphorylated during electrophoretic migration (5Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. Verma A.K. Dux L. Molnár E. Gárdos G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 939: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have been able to fully confirm the value of this SDS-PAGE system. The proteolytic peptides in the PK-treated SR membranes, submitted to phosphorylation according to various protocols, followed by acid quenching and resuspension in SDS, could be clearly separated without much loss of the covalently bound 32P (less than half of the radioactivity was lost from the phosphorylated fragments; see Fig. A in Supplemental Material) and with higher resolution than by the Weber and Osborn procedure commonly used for revealing phosphorylated P-type ATPases (data not shown). In the following, we have therefore combined the use of such Sarkadi gels with the use of various phosphorylation and dephosphorylation protocols, previously developed to study individual steps in the catalytic cycle of either SR intact Ca2+-ATPase or expressed wild-type or mutant ATPase (e.g. Refs. 17Clarke D.M.

The p95C-p14N Complex Can Be Phosphorylated from [γ-32P]ATP at a Relatively High Rate, but Dephosphorylates Very Slowly, Even in the Presence of ADP—Lanes 2–4 in Fig. 2A show PhosphorImager analysis of an experiment in which PK-treated SR vesicles, equilibrated in the presence of Ca2+, were reacted with [γ-32P]ATP for 5, 15, or 30 s on ice before acid quenching and electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. Besides residual intact ATPase, 32P was retained to a significant extent only by the large p95C and p83C proteolytic fragments, as expected on the basis of previous experiments performed at steady state (3Møller J.V.

The final phosphorylation levels were similar, as shown by dividing the number of picomoles of 32P associated with each band (shown in panel A) by the extent of Coomassie Blue staining of the same band (shown in panel C), a procedure that also allowed us to take into account any small difference in the total amount of protein loaded onto each lane that could be due to a slightly variable recovery of the acid-precipitated proteins. On a time scale of a few seconds, phosphorylation of the p95C fragment on ice was fast and indistinguishable from that of either intact ATPase or p83C-p28N complex. When the exact time course of phosphorylation was resolved, using a quenched flow equipment with millisecond time resolution at 20 °C, we found that the rate of phosphorylation of the p95C peptide was actually somewhat slower (3-fold) than that of intact ATPase (Fig. F in Supplemental Material). In separate experiments performed on ice, steady-state phosphorylation levels apparently revealed a fairly similar dependence on free Ca2+ for intact ATPase and the proteolytic peptides (Fig. G in Supplemental Material; see, however, below experiments designed to reveal the true affinity of the peptides for Ca2+ in the absence of steady-state phosphorylation). The reaction of phosphorylation from ATP in the p95C-p14N complex (the “Ca2E1 to Ca2E1P” transition) therefore appears not to be very different from that of intact ATPase or the p83C-p28N complex. In contrast, after steady state was reached, EGTA-induced dephosphorylation of the p95C-p14N complex was very slow, even slower than that of the p83C-p28N complex, whose dephosphorylation is itself much slower than that of intact ATPase (as previously demonstrated in Ref. 3Møller J.V.

This was the case both when dephosphorylation was triggered by addition of EGTA and excess non-radioactive MgATP in the presence of an ATP regenerating system (to induce dephosphorylation in the normal direction of the cycle while reducing the ADP content as much as possible, see lanes 5–7 in Fig. 2), and when dephosphorylation was triggered by addition of EGTA and excess ADP (to assay the amount of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, see lanes 8–10 in Fig. 2). In the latter case, too, most of the p95 fragment remained phosphorylated in an unusually stable s"

To overcome this problem, we developed a system for mediating RNA interference in monocytic cells. The p110α isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) was silenced using a lentiviral vector expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA). This resulted in the generation of stable THP-1 and U-937 monocytic cell lines deficient in p110α. Notably, p110α was silenced without affecting levels of either the other class IA PI3K catalytic subunits p110β and p110δ, or the p85α regulatory subunit. The role of p110α in mediating cell adherence was examined. Monocyte adherence induced in response to either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (D3) was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. However, although adherence induced in response to D3 was sensitive to silencing of p110α, LPS-induced adherence was not. Expression of the monocyte differentiation marker CD11b was also induced by D3 in a PI3K-dependent manner and gene silencing using shRNA showed that p110α was also required for this effect. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that LPS and D3 use distinct isoforms of class IA PI3K to induce functional responses and that lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNA is a powerful approach to study monocyte biology.

From the perspectives of cell biology, understanding disease causation, and developing novel therapeutics, there continues to be a great deal of interest in understanding how the responses of these cells are regulated. However, study of monocyte and macrophage biology through genetic manipulation by non-viral transfection methods has been challenging (reviewed in Ref. 1Burke B. Sumner S. Maitland N. Lewis C.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 72: 417-428PubMed Google Scholar).

Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). RNAi is a natural regulatory mechanism that occurs in many organisms, including plants, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 7Shi Y. Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The RNAi pathway begins by processing dsRNA into short (<30 bp) dsRNA duplexes called small interference RNA (siRNA) by a host RNase Dicer. The siRNA then becomes incorporated into a multicomponent nuclease complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC then uses the siRNA sequence as a guide to recognize cognate mRNAs for degradation. Delivery of siRNAs into mammalian cells by transfection of siRNA or DNA vectors expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) has been shown to mediate RNAi successfully (8Elbashir S.M. Harborth J.

Transfection of siRNA is transient lasting only for a week or so (12Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar), although DNA-based vectors may last longer with drug selection (10Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). In contrast, viral vectors have also been used to deliver siRNA successfully, and these methods tend to provide more stable gene silencing (13Xia H. Mao Q. Paulson H.L. Davidson B.L. Nat.

Here we report that human monocytic cell lines can be effectively transduced using a lentiviral vector to stably silence an endogenous lipid kinase. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) constitute a family of at least eight different lipid kinases that phosphorylate the hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides at the 3′ position. The phosphoinositide (PI) metabolites produced as a result are known to be involved in regulating a multitude of cellular events such as mitogenic responses, differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, membrane traffic along the exocytic and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Ref. 16Vanhaesebroeck B.

A considerable amount of research has led to the conclusion that this diversity of cellular control is differentially mediated by distinct PI3K isoforms (20Vanhaesebroeck B. Jones G.E. Allen W.E.

In vitro, class I PI3K isoforms phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), PtdIns 4-phosphate, and PtdIns 4,5-bisphosphate. Class I PI3K is further divided into two subclasses (IA and IB), both of which are known to be activated by cell surface receptors. Mammalian class IA PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a regulatory subunit (p85α, p85β, p55, or other splice variants) and a p110 (α, β, or δ isoforms) catalytic subunit (23Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Through their Src-homology 2 domain-containing p85 subunits, class IA PI3K are recruited to and are activated by either cell surface receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity or receptors coupled to Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases. 1α,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (D3) is a biologically active from of vitamin D and plays an important role in numerous cellular and physiological processes such as calcium homeostasis and regulates cells of the hematopoietic system (reviewed in Refs. 26Pinette K.V.

For example, D3 induces maturation markers such as CD11b and CD14 in monocytic cell lines such as THP-1, U-937, and HL-60 (18Hmama Z. Nandan D. Sly L. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J.

Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Reiner N.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). D3 also induces adherence in cells of the human promonocytic cell line THP-1 (29Schwende H. Fitzke E. Ambs P. Dieter P. J. Leukoc.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is also known to enhance adherence of leukocytes in vitro (34Pohlman T.H. Stanness K.A. Beatty P.G. Ochs H.D. Harlan J.M. J.

To provide a basis for studying the roles of specific PI3K isoforms in regulating the function of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte series, the objective of the present study was to create stable monocytic cell lines that express shRNA targeting a specific PI3K isoform. Using this approach, we examined the role of the p110α isoform of class IA PI3K in mediating responses to LPS and D3. Reagents and Chemicals—RPMI 1640, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, Hanks’ balanced salt solution, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 m HEPES solution were from Stem Cell Technologies (Vancouver, BC). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4, Polybrene, and poly-l-lysine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). LY294002, 1α,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and antibodies to human p110δ were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Antibody to human p110α (clone 19) was from BD Biosciences (Mississauga, Ontario). Antibodies to human p110β and actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p85-N-SH3 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). RPE-conjugated anti-CD11b antibody and RPE-conjugated isotype-matched control antibody were from Caltag Laboratories (San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat secondary antibodies were from Cedarlane Laboratories (Hornby, Ontario). Cell Lines—The promonocytic cell lines THP-1 and U-937 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were maintained without exceeding 0.5 × 106 cells/ml. 293T human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, were also from ATCC and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 20 mm HEPES. Constructs—The U6 promoter vectors pSHAG-1 and pSHAG-Ff1 were kind gifts from Dr. G. J. Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). pSHAG-1 contains the attL1/L2 transposition elements that are compatible with Gateway Cloning Technology (Invitrogen Canada Inc.). Antisense to p110α mRNA (GenBank™ NM_006218) was targeted to two nucleotide segments: 5′-ATATACATTCCTGATCTTCCTCGTGCTG-3′ (nucleotide positions 1171–1198, referred to as α3) and 5′-CAAGACCATCATCAGGTGAACTGTGGGG-3′ (nucleotide positions 8–35, referred to as α1). The hairpin-containing sequence was created as described previously (14Paddison P.J. Hannon G.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 17-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides p110α1 and p110α3 listed in Table I were synthesized by Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). All of the sequences contained a HindIII site in the hairpin region, a site that is not present in the native pSHAG-1 vector, and BamHI and BseRI ends to enable directional cloning. The oligonucleotides were annealed and then ligated into pSHAG-1 via the BamHI/BseRI site. DH5α E. coli (Invitrogen) were transformed, and clones were screened by HindIII digestion. pSHAG-Ff1 contains a U6-driven sequence that generates an hairpin RNA that targets GL3 firefly luciferase at nucleotide positions 1619–1647 (GenBank™ U47296) (9Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Construction of the lentiviral transducing plasmid, pHR-CMV-EGFP, packaging vector pCMVΔR8.2, and VSV envelope vector pMD.G have been described elsewhere (41Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4039) Google Scholar, 42Naldini L. Blomer U. Gage F.H. Trono D. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11382-11388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Purified pSHAG-1, pSHAG-p110α1, and pSHAG-p110α3 served as entry clones. The lentiviral transducing vector pHR-CMV-EGFP was modified by inserting the Gateway vector conversion cassette (Invitrogen) in the ClaI site, which is located downstream of 5′-LTR, but upstream of the CMV promoter. The resulting pHR-Gateway served as a destination vector, because it contained attR1/2 sites. The various entry clones were transposed to the pHR-Gateway by Gateway LR Clonase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). Positive clones were then isolated, and the plasmids (pHR-U6, pHR-p110α1, and pHR-p110α3) were purified. All plasmid purifications were carried out using Qiagen Endofree Plasmid kits.Table IShort hairpin RNA encoding sequences targeting human p110α mRNA Hairpin sequences with the HindIII site are underlined and italicized. For each construct, the two strands of DNA were annealed and ligated into the pSHAG-1 vector. The underlined sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends are for directional cloning into pSHAG-1, which was cut with BseRI and BamH1.

The medium was changed the next day, and cells were cultured for another 24 h. Conditioned medium was then collected and cleared of debris by low speed centrifugation (2,500 × g for 5 min) filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and stored at -70 °C. This collection was repeated daily for three more days, and media from the 4 days were pooled and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g, at 4 °C for 2 h. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of medium (overnight on a nutator at 4 °C), and aliquots were stored at -70 °C. Viral stocks were assayed for the p24 core antigen using the Vironostika HIV-1 Antigen ELISA kit (bioMérieux, Inc., Durham, NC) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Titration of the Lentiviral Vectors—1 × 105 293T cells were plated in each well of a six-well plate. On the following day, cells from three wells were removed with cell dissociation solution (Sigma) and counted to determine the average number of cells at the time of titration. Three dilutions (1/50,000, 1/5,000, and 1/500) of the concentrated viral stocks were used to transduce the cells. Transduction of 293T cells was done in the presence of transduction adjuvant Polybrene (8 μg/ml). The medium was changed 24 h after transduction. Cells were removed 48 h post-transduction and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression. The calculation used to determine the titer was as follows: transduction units/ml = (average cell number at the time of transduction × % of GFP-positive cells)/100 × dilution factor. Transduction of Target Cells—1 × 105 THP-1 or U-937 cells were seeded in each well of a 12-well plate in 500 μl of complete media and transduced by lentiviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1. Transduction was carried out in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). Transduced cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after 6 days. For transduction of 293T HEK cells, 1 × 105 cells were seeded in each well of a 12-well plate and transduced the next day. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in boiling lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA) for 5 min and passed through a 27-gauge needle. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min, and protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature depending on the antibody. Primary and secondary antibodies were used according to manufacturer’s instructions, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Adherence Assay—An adherence assay was performed as reported previously with some modifications (37Hmama Z. Knutson K.L. Herrera-Velit P. Nandan D. Reiner N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1050-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well flat bottomed culture plates were filled with 5 × 104 THP-1 cells in 200 μl of culture medium. Cells were either treated or not with 25 μm LY294002 for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by LPS (12.5–500 ng/ml), D3 (100 nm), or PMA (20 ng/ml). All treatments were done in triplicate. LPS was opsonized with 50% normal human serum for 30 min at 37 °C prior to use. Plates were incubated for 24 h (for LPS treatment) or 48 h (D3 treatment) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed by three washes with 200 μl of warm culture medium (37 °C). The remaining cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, for 15 min at 37 °C. Fixed cells were then washed once and stained with 0.05% crystal violet in 20% methanol for 10 min at room temperature. Dye was removed, and the wells were rinsed with water three times. The plates were allowed to dry at room temperature. Cell-associated dye was eluted in 100 μl per well of 100% methanol, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a microtiter plate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Absorbance of adherent cells were normalized to PMA-treated cells. Dual Luciferase Assay—2 × 105 293T HEK cells were plated in each well of a 12-well culture plate and transfected the following day with 0.05 μg of pGL3-SV40 and 0.02 μg of pRL-TK reporter plasmids (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 48 h later and assayed for luciferase and Renilla activity using Dual Luciferase Assay reagent (Promega). Activities are reported as ratios of Photinus pyralis GL3 luciferase (Pp-luc) to Renilla reniformis RL luciferase (Rr-luc). Flow Cytometry Analysis—1 × 106 cells were washed once with binding buffer (Hanks’ balanced salt solution, 1% fetal calf serum, and 0.1% NaN3), and then stained with anti-CD11b-RPE-conjugated antibody, or isotype-matched control-RPE-conjugated antibody for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed once with binding buffer and resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer containing 1.85% paraformaldehyde. 10,000 cells were analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Data were acquired using BD CellQuest software and analyzed using Summit V3.1 software (Cytomation Inc., Fort Collins, CO). Statistical Analysis—One-way ANOVA was performed on each group and followed by Tukey test for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. All statistics and graphs were performed using Prism software, version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Construction of VSV-pseudotyped Lentiviral Vector Expressing shRNA—To deliver siRNA into monocytic cell lines, we developed a lentiviral-based vector that expresses a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Fig. 1, A and B). Vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have been shown previously to be able to transduce GFP into monocytic cell lines (4Stripecke R. Cardoso A.A. Pepper K.A. Skelton D.C. Yu X.J. Mascarenhas L. Weinberg K.I. Nadler L.M. Kohn D.B. Blood. 2000; 96: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VSV glycoprotein G is a substitute for the lentiviral gp120/gp41 as the viral coat protein, because it broadens the range of cell types that can be infected by the virus and also helps to stabilize the virion, yielding higher titers of the virus (41Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4039) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by stabilizing the virion, VSV G protein also allows the viral particles to be concentrated by ultracentrifugation, thereby providing higher titers for transduction (41Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4039) Google Scholar, 43Follenzi A. Naldini L. Methods Mol. Med. 2002; 69: 259-274PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesized sense and antisense oligonucleotides encoding the shRNA (Table I) were annealed and then ligated into the BamH1/BseRI site of pSHAG-1 downstream of the RNA polymerase III-specific U6 promoter (not shown) (9Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). The U6 promoter and the sequence encoding shRNA were then subcloned into the viral transducing vector (pHR-U6-shRNA) using Gateway cloning. The resulting plasmid was then used for transient transfection of the packaging cell line HEK 293T (Fig. 1A). Transfection of separate plasmids encoding viral structural genes (gag-pol gene products and accessory proteins on pCMVΔR8.2, and VSV G glycoprotein on pMD.G) and non-structural sequences (packaging sequence Ψ, Rev Responsive Element, and LTRs on pHR-U6-shRNA), ensures that progeny virus and the target cell will not contain any genes that encode viral proteins (44Buchschacher Jr., G.L. Wong-Staal F. Blood. 2000; 95: 2499-2504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses were released into the medium and collected every 24 h for 4 days. Viral particles were conc"

In human ANG transgenic mice, administration of cholic acid resulted in the down-regulation of human ANG gene expression in the liver. ANG gene expression in HepG2 cells was also repressed by chenodeoxycholic acid. Because the expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP) mRNA was induced by chenodeoxycholic acid in HepG2 cells, we analyzed the effects of SHP on the human ANG promoter. Promoter mutation analysis demonstrated that SHP repressed human ANG promoter activity through the element, which has been previously determined as a binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4). SHP repressed human ANG promoter activity only when the HNF-4 expression vector was cotransfected in HeLa cells. Furthermore, we found that SHP bound to the HNF-4 N-terminal region including the DNA-binding domain and activation function-1 and that SHP prevented HNF-4 from binding to the human ANG promoter. These results suggest that bile acids negatively regulate the human ANG gene through the inhibitory effect of SHP on HNF-4.

Bile acids are physiological detergents that facilitate excretion, absorption, and transport of fats and sterols in the intestine and liver. It has been revealed recently that bile acids also function as signaling molecules for regulating bile acid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis (1Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, hepatorenal syndrome, a disease with acute renal failure induced by severe hepatic diseases, is thought to result from the disruption of vasoactive factor control, but its mechanism is ill defined. In hepatorenal syndrome, arterial vasodilation occurs despite high plasma renin activity (26Gines P. Arroyo V. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1833-1839PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate the effect of bile acids on ANG transcription. In this study, we measured ANG mRNA levels in human ANG transgenic mice and HepG2 cells, both treated with bile acids, and demonstrated that bile acids repress the expression of the human ANG gene. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SHP represses the human ANG promoter by inhibiting HNF-4 binding to the promoter.

At the end of the treatment period, all animals were fasted overnight, weighed, and killed by cervical dislocation. Livers were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until used. Cell Culture and Transfection Assays—HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. HepG2 cells used in Northern blot analysis were plated at a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish; washed; incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.01% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA); and harvested for assays. HepG2 cells used in transfection assays were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/24-well cluster tissue culture plate. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). All samples were complemented with empty pcDNA3 vectors (Invitrogen) to an equal total amount of DNA (300 ng). After 48 h of incubation, luciferase activity was assayed with ARVO™SX (Wallac Berthold). Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfecting 100 ng of SV40-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid.

[35S]Methionine-labeled HNF-4 and its mutants were prepared by in vitro translation using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) and T7 RNA polymerase. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with the GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 4 h in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). After washing the beads with binding buffer, the pull-down complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using an imaging analyzer. HEK293T whole cell extracts transiently expressing FLAG-tagged HNF-4 were prepared with lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). HEK293T whole cell extracts were incubated with GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 5 h in 1 ml of lysis buffer. After washing the beads with lysis buffer, the pull-down complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was probed with anti-FLAG antibody M2 and detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

The reaction mixtures were directly loaded onto 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 5% glycerol made in 1× 90 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at 130 V for 3 h at 4 °C, and the gels were dried and analyzed with a bioimaging analyzer. Cholic Acid Decreases Liver ANG mRNA Levels in Human ANG Transgenic Mice—To assess whether bile acids affect the expression of the human ANG gene, human ANG transgenic mice were treated for 7 days with a 1% (w/w) cholic acid diet. Northern blot analysis was performed to measure human ANG mRNA levels in the liver, the major site of ANG production. A human ANG-specific probe (21Takahashi S. Fukamizu A. Hasegawa T. Yokoyama M. Nomura T. Katsuki M. Murakami K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used to detect ANG mRNA, and β-actin mRNA levels were measured to normalize ANG mRNA expression. The administration of cholic acid resulted in an ∼50% decrease in human ANG gene expression compared with that in control chow diet-fed mice (Fig. 1A). We also measured the expression of HNF-4, which is a major regulator of human ANG gene transcription in the liver (18Yanai K. Hirota K. Taniguchi-Yanai K. Shigematsu Y. Shimamoto Y. Saito T. Chowdhury S. Takiguchi M. Arakawa M. Nibu Y. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34605-34612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). HNF-4 mRNA levels did not change significantly in this experiment (Fig. 1B). CDCA Decreases Human ANG mRNA in HepG2 Cells—We further examined the effect of bile acids on ANG expression in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. Because the function of HepG2 cells transporting bile acids across cell membranes is markedly small compared with that of normal liver cells (32Kullak-Ublick G.A. Beuers U. Paumgartner G. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1053-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used CDCA, a hydrophobic bile acid that does not require transporters. HepG2 cells were incubated for 0, 12, and 24 h in medium containing 100 μm CDCA, and ANG mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. In the 24-h treated cells, there was an ∼70% reduction in the level of human ANG mRNA compared with that in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2A). Because SHP is induced by bile acids to repress target genes (2Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar, 3Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar), we measured the mRNA levels of SHP. SHP mRNA levels showed a 3.5-fold increase in the 12-h treated cells, and the levels were reduced to the same levels as in vehicle-treated cells 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that bile acid induces SHP mRNA and represses ANG mRNA in HepG2 cells. SHP Represses Human ANG Promoter Activity in HepG2 Cells—We wondered whether the repression of the ANG gene by bile acids is caused by SHP induction. The effect of SHP on the 5′-deletions of the human ANG promoter was analyzed in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, SHP reduced the activity of the ANG promoter containing sequence –1222 to +44 (13-Luc). This repression was still observed in the DM4 and DM7 constructs, but was abolished in the DM7.8, DM8, and DM9 constructs. Therefore, sequence –516 to –344 appears to contain the site negatively regulated by SHP, which includes the HNF-4-responsive region (nucleotides –429 to –386) referred to as the C region (18Yanai K. Hirota K. Taniguchi-Yanai K. Shigematsu Y. Shimamoto Y. Saito T. Chowdhury S. Takiguchi M. Arakawa M. Nibu Y. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34605-34612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To test whether the C region could mediate the repression by SHP, two types of reporters were used: the 13ΔC-Luc reporter (the C region was deleted from the –1222/+44 promoter construct) for Fig. 3B and the CSVP-Luc reporter (six copies of the C region were cloned in front of the SV40 promoter) for Fig. 3C. Whereas SHP repressed the 13-Luc reporter, it failed to repress the 13ΔC-Luc reporter (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, SHP repressed the CSVP-Luc reporter, whereas the control SV40 promoter (SVP-Luc) was not repressed by SHP cotransfection (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the C region is the cis-acting element that is responsible for SHP repressing human ANG promoter activity. SHP Represses Human ANG Promoter Activity via HNF-4 — We tested whether SHP represses the human ANG gene promoter by inhibiting HNF-4 transcriptional activity. To this end, we assessed the effect of SHP on human ANG promoter activity in HeLa cells, which do not express endogenous HNF-4 (33Rajas F. Gautier A. Bady I. Montano S. Mithieux G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15736-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transfection of HNF-4 activated the transcription of luciferase driven by the ANG promoter in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, cotransfection of SHP with the HNF-4 expression vector resulted in a dose-dependent repression of ANG promoter activity. In contrast, SHP failed to repress ANG promoter activity without the cotransfection of the HNF-4 expression vector (Fig. 4A). Similarly, transfection of HNF-4 activated the transcription of the CSVP-Luc reporter, and cotransfection of SHP with the HNF-4 expression vector resulted in a dose-dependent repression of the CSVP-Luc reporter. SHP did not repress the activity of the CSVP-Luc reporter without the co-transfection of the HNF-4 expression vector. The control SV40-driven luciferase gene did not respond to the cotransfection of the HNF-4 or SHP expression vector (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that SHP prevents HNF-4 from activating the human ANG promoter. SHP Inhibits the Binding of HNF-4 to the Human ANG Promoter—To determine how SHP inhibits the transcriptional activity of HNF-4, we analyzed the interaction sites in HNF-4 and SHP. By GST pull-down assay, we confirmed that SHP binds to AF-2 (activation function-2) of HNF-4 as reported previously (10Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and demonstrated that it bound to the N-terminal region of HNF-4, which includes the DNA-binding domain and AF-1 (activation function-1) (Fig. 5A). Conversely, we confirmed that HNF-4 bound to the region of SHP located at amino acids 1–160 (SHP-NT), but not to the region at amino acids 161–257 (SHP-CT), by GST pull-down assay (Fig. 5B). Because SHP binds to the region of HNF-4 involved in DNA binding (34Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Jiang G. Lee U. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we further assessed whether SHP affects the binding of HNF-4 to the C region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the labeled human ANG C region oligonucleotide with HepG2 nuclear extract resulted in the formation of two retarded complexes (Fig. 5C, lane 1). The supershift experiment using anti-HNF-4 antibody showed that the major band represents the HNF-4 complex (lane 8). This binding was C region-specific because the unlabeled C region oligonucleotide efficiently competed for this binding (lane 9). The reaction of GST-SHP with the C region determined that SHP did not bind to the C region (lane 10). Addition of GST-SHP to HepG2 nuclear extract inhibited HNF-4 binding to the C region in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 5–7). Control GST protein did not affect the binding of HNF-4 to the C region (lanes 2–4). Furthermore, we confirmed that the SHP-NT mutant, which bound to HNF-4, inhibited the DNA binding of HNF-4 (Fig. 5D, lane 3). In contrast, the SHP-CT mutant, which did not bind to HNF-4, did not prevent HNF-4 binding to the C region (lane 4). These experiments demonstrate that SHP inhibits the binding of HNF-4 to the C region of the human ANG promoter. It is well known that bile acids are not only a simple metabolic by-product, but a transcriptional regulator of bile acid metabolism. The target genes for bile acids involved in bile acid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis, and gluconeogenesis such as the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1) (2Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R.

It also had been reported recently that kininogen, a peptide that functions as a vasodilation factor, is up-regulated by bile acids (38Zhao A. Lew J.L. Huang L. Yu J. Zhang T. Hrywna Y. Thompson J.R. de Pedro N. Blevins R.A. Pelaez F. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28765-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the effect of bile acids on ANG expression in the liver. Bile acid treatments decreased human ANG mRNA levels both in vivo and in the cell line (Figs. 1 and 2) and repressed human ANG promoter activity through SHP by inhibiting the binding of HNF-4 to the ANG promoter (Figs. 3, 4, 5). These results demonstrate that ANG, a vasoactive factor, is a novel target of bile acids. Two types of mechanisms of bile acid-induced gene transcriptional repression have been reported. One mechanism via a phosphorylation signaling pathway, activated by bile acids, such as JNK/c-Jun provides a rapid response to target gene repression. The other mechanism via SHP gene induction by the bile acid farnesoid X receptor shows a slower response compared with the JNK/c-Jun pathway (1Chiang J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In our study, the repression of ANG by CDCA was a relatively slow process, requiring between 12 and 24 h (Fig. 2A). Because it has been reported that the peak of repression by the JNK/c-Jun pathway takes place 2 h after bile acid stimulation (39Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the repression of ANG over 24 h after bile acid stimulation occurs due to the JNK/c-Jun pathway. Therefore, it was suggested that ANG gene expression is repressed by bile acids in a farnesoid X receptor/SHP-mediated process. A recent study reported that SHP represses HNF-4 transcriptional activity through the two mechanisms: passive inhibition by competition with coactivators and active repression by SHP with an unknown cause (10Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These mechanisms are supported by the fact that SHP binds to the AF-2 region of HNF-4, which functions as a cofactor target (10Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrated that SHP bound not only to the AF-2 region, but also to the N-terminal region of HNF-4, and that SHP inhibited the binding of HNF-4 to DNA (Fig. 5). The DNA binding inhibition by SHP may result from SHP masking the DNA-binding domain of HNF-4. On the other hand, there is another possible mechanism to inhibit DNA binding. It had been reported that the AF-2 region also functions as a homodimerization domain of HNF-4 and that homodimer formation has a critical role in binding to DNA (34Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Kistanova E. Evagelopoulou C. Zeng S. Cladaras C. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 539-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 35Jiang G. Lee U. Sladek F.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that SHP inhibits the DNA binding of HNF-4 by preventing HNF-4 homodimerization via interaction with the AF-2 region of HNF-4. Although it has already been reported that SHP inhibits the DNA binding of the retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor (4Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and the liver receptor homolog (40Kovacic A. Speed C.J. Simpson E.R. Clyne C.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 18: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), our study is the first to demonstrate that SHP inhibits the DNA binding of HNF-4. ANG is the substrate of renin, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the renin/angiotensin system that plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure. It had been shown that bile acids are isolated as a renin inhibitor (41Kokubu T. Hiwada K. Yamamura Y. Hayashi K. Okumura J. Hori M. Kobayashi S. Ueno H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1972; 21: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition to this enzymatic inhibitory activity, this work, which identified ANG as a target gene for bile acids, provides another possible action point where bile acids negatively regulate the renin/angiotensin system at the transcriptional level.

Images of the comet reconstructed from high-resolution spectra reveal a quasi-spherical cloud of neutral hydrogen and a variable tail of C+ and C2+ that disconnects from the comet and subsequently regenerates. The high abundance of C2+ and C+, at least 24% relative to water, cannot be explained by photodissociation of carbon monoxide and is instead attributed to the evaporation and subsequent photoionization of atomic carbon from organic refractory compounds present in the cometary dust grains. This result serves to strengthen the connection between comets and the material from which the Solar System formed."
https://openalex.org/W2018945321,"Abstract The genomes of several cyanobacteria show the existence of gene clusters encoding subunits I, II, and III of aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase. The enzyme occurs on both plasma and thylakoid membranes of these oxygenic phototrophic prokaryotes. Here we report the expression and purification of a truncated subunit II copper A (CuA) domain (i.e. the electron entry and donor binding site) of cytochrome c oxidase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 in high yield. The water-soluble purple redox-active bimetallic center displays a relatively low standard reduction potential of 216 mV. Its absorption spectrum at pH 7 is similar to that of other soluble fragments from aa3-type oxidases, but the insensitivity of both absorbance and circular dichroism spectra to pH suggests that it is less exposed to the aqueous milieu compared with other CuA domains. Oxidation of horse heart cytochrome c by the bimetallic center follows monophasic kinetics. At pH 7 and low ionic strength the bimolecular rate constant is (2.1 ± 0.3) × 104 m–1 s–1, and the rates decrease upon the increase of ionic strength. Sequence alignment and modeling of cyanobacterial CuA domains show several peculiarities such as: (i) a large insertion located between the second transmembrane region and the putative hydrophobic cytochrome c docking site, (ii) the lack of acidic residues shown to be important in the interaction between cytochrome c and Paracoccus CuA domain, and (iii) an extended C terminus similar to Escherichia coli ubiquinol oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1996101564,"Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) plays a key role in energy generation by coupling the oxidation of succinate to the reduction of ubiquinone in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDH is composed of a catalytic dimer of the Sdh1p and Sdh2p subunits containing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and iron-sulfur clusters and a heme b-containing membrane-anchoring domain comprised of the Sdh3p and Sdh4p subunits. We systematically mutated all the histidine and cysteine residues in Sdh3p and Sdh4p to identify the residues involved in axial heme ligation. The mutants were characterized for growth on a non-fermentable carbon source, for enzyme assembly, for succinate-dependent quinone reduction, for heme b content, and for heme spectral properties. Mutation of Sdh3p His-46 or His-113 leads to a marked reduction in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for quinone reduction, suggesting that these residues form part of a quinone-binding site. We identified Sdh3p His-106 and Sdh4p Cys-78 as the most probable axial ligands for cytochrome b562. Replacement of His-106 or Cys-78 with an alanine residue leads to a marked reduction in cytochrome b562 content and to altered heme spectral characteristics that are consistent with a direct perturbation of heme b environment. This is the first identification of a cysteine residue serving as an axial ligand for heme b in the SDH family of enzymes.

The MRC is composed of four multisubunit enzymes, complexes I-IV, that transfer electrons from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen and capture the energy of substrate oxidation in the form of proton gradient, which is used for ATP synthesis by complex V. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), also known as complex II or the succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is a member of both the Krebs cycle and the MRC and oxidizes succinate to reduce ubiquinone (1Ackrell B.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 2Cecchini G.

The involvement of SDH in these clinical conditions has generated significant interest in understanding the structure of mitochondrial members of the SDH family. Membrane-bound fumarate reductases (FRDs), which are found in anaerobic organisms respiring with fumarate as terminal electron acceptor, are functionally and structurally related to SDH (2Cecchini G.

The crystal structures of the Escherichia coli SDH (16Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), the E. coli FRD (17Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C.

Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) have tremendously increased our understanding of the structures of these enzymes. SDH and FRD enzymes consist of a hydrophilic catalytic dimer that protrudes into the mitochondrial matrix or the bacterial cytoplasm and either one or two integral membrane subunits. The catalytic subunits exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation across species and, as expected, adopt very similar structures. The larger subunit carries a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), while the smaller subunit contains three iron-sulfur centers. In contrast, the SDH and FRD membrane subunits show considerable diversity in their primary structures and in cofactor composition, and are believed to contribute to the distinct properties of the enzymes in different biological systems (4Hägerhäll C.

The E. coli FRD was crystallized without heme and with two bound menaquinone molecules, while the E. coli SDH was crystallized with one heme and one ubiquinone. FRD from W. succinogenes has a single membrane subunit, which contains two hemes, but the crystals did not contain any bound quinone (18Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). All SDHs characterized to date are known to interact with one or two protoheme b molecules. The role of heme in electron transfer from succinate to quinone remains poorly understood despite the recent high resolution crystal structures. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SDH is a tetrameric (Sdh1p-Sdh4p), single heme-containing enzyme that has been extensively studied as a model mitochondrial enzyme (6Lemire B.D. Oyedotun K.S. Biochim.

In addition, molecular dynamics simulation studies suggest that the cysteine residue is used as the axial ligand because a more bulky histidine could not be accommodated without distorting the protein backbone conformation (44Oyedotun K.S.

In this report, we employ site-directed mutagenesis and spectroscopic and catalytic analysis to investigate these predictions. Our results strongly suggest that the yeast SDH differs from other family members by using a cysteine residue as an axial heme ligand.

The proportion of ρ- cells in a culture was determined by mating to the ρ0 strain, MS10 (matα, kar1-1, leu2-3, canR, ρ0), and testing the respiratory competence of the diploid on YPG plates. Bacterial strains were routinely grown on LB medium at 37 °C using ampicillin as the selectable marker. Construction of Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR as described (25Ho S.N.

Enzyme Assays—The succinate-dependent reduction of quinone was monitored spectrophotometrically at 22 °C as the malonate-sensitive, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-decyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DB)-mediated reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP). The succinate-dependent, phenazine methosulfate (PMS)-mediated reduction of DCPIP is a measure of membrane-associated Sdh1p/Sdh2p dimer.

Our homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation studies of the S. cerevisiae SDH have suggested that Sdh3p His-106 and Sdh4p Cys-78 are likely axial heme ligands (44Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9424-9431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since, there are no histidine residues in the vicinity of Sdh4p Cys-78 that could serve as the axial ligand, this suggests that heme ligation in this enzyme is unusual. We also wished to mutate Sdh3p His-46 of the sequence LSSLHRIS (residues 42-49), which closely resembles the quinone-binding site sequence motif (LXXXHXXT, where X represents any amino acid) (32Fisher N. Rich P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 33Rich P. Fisher N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All five histidines in the Sdh3p subunit were systematically mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to alanine (H30A, H46A, H84A, H106A, and H113A; Fig. 1A). Sdh3p His-46 was also mutated to an Asp residue (H46D) to explore the effects of introducing a negative charge at the proposed quinone-binding site. Similarly, the two histidines and the two cysteines in the Sdh4p subunit were mutated to alanine residues (H37A, C78A, C85A, and H99A; Fig. 1B). In addition, Sdh4p Cys-78 was mutated to histidine (C78H) to test the hypothesis that a cysteine residue is employed as heme ligand in the yeast SDH because the heme-binding pocket cannot accommodate a more bulky histidine residue (44Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9424-9431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Respiratory Competence of Mutants—The mutant SDH3 genes were cloned into a single copy shuttle vector YCplac33 and introduced into the SDH3-knockout strain sdh3W3. Similarly, mutant SDH4 genes were cloned into the vector pRS416 and the resulting plasmids introduced into sdh4W2. The respiratory proficiencies of the mutant strains were determined on a minimal glycerol medium (Table II). All mutant strains were able to support respiratory growth, although to varying degrees. The growth of the sdh3W3/H30A and the sdh3W3/H84A strains were indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain. sdh3W3/H46A and sdh3W3/H46D exhibited the slowest growth, indicating a respiratory defect. Similarly, all SDH4 mutant strains supported growth on the minimal glycerol medium, although the growth of the sdh4W2/C78H was reduced. To quantify respiratory growth, the growth yields on semisynthetic medium containing 0.1-0.5% galactose as carbon source were measured. S. cerevisiae exhibits a diauxic shift when cultured in this medium; an initial fermentative growth is followed by a respiratory phase when the fermentable carbon source is limiting (21Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23956-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16936-16943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A and B show the optical densities at 600 nm of late stationary phase cultures. Wild type and mutant strains showed similar growth rates during the fermentative phase (data not shown). As expected, sdh3W3 achieved, by fermentation alone, a growth yield of 11 ± 1% (Fig. 2A). The growth yields of MH125 and the sdh3W3 strain carrying a wild-type plasmid-borne SDH3 gene, sdh3W3/pYCSDH3 are similar. The growth yields of sdh3W3/H30A and sdh3W3/H84A strains are comparable to the wild type at 95 ± 3 and 90 ± 4%, respectively. The sdh3W3/H106A mutant retained a significant capacity for respiratory growth with a 75 ± 4% growth yield. In contrast, the H46A, the H46D, and the H113A mutants showed impaired respiratory growth with yields of 50 ± 2, 55 ± 3, and 65 ± 3%, respectively, consistent with their slower growths on a minimal glycerol medium. The Sdh4p mutations H37A and C78A have no significant effect on growth yields. The sdh4W2/C78H and sdh4W2/H99A achieved growth yields of 50 ± 2% and 75 ± 3%, respectively. These observations suggest that the Sdh3p H46A, H46D, and H113A mutations and the Sdh4p C78H substitution compromise respiratory growth in S. cerevisiae.Table IICovalent flavin levels and succinate-PMS/DCPIP reductase activities of isolated membranesYeast strainsGrowth on minimal glycerolCovalent FADaCovalent flavin contents are expressed as pmol of FAD mg of protein−1.

Open table in a new tab Assembly of Mutant and Wild-type SDH Enzymes—To investigate the effect of the mutations on enzyme assembly, we measured the levels of covalent FAD in mitochondrial membranes (Table II). SDH is the major flavoprotein in S. cerevisiae and the covalent flavin levels of mitochondrial membranes quantitatively reflect SDH assembly (22Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16936-16943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The covalent FAD contents of all the SDH3 mutant strains, with the exception of the sdh3W3/H106A strain, were not significantly different from the wild type. Similarly, the covalent FAD contents of the sdh4W2/H30A and the sdh4W2/C78A strains were comparable to wild-type level. The covalent flavin level of the sdh4W2/C78H membrane was reduced by about 2-fold, while that of the sdh4W2/H99A was slightly, but significantly reduced. We conclude that enzyme assembly proceeds normally in most mutants but that the Sdh3p H106A, the Sdh4p C78H, and the Sdh4p H99A mutations mildly impair enzyme assembly or stability. Membrane-associated succinate-dependent PMS reductase activity depends on the membrane anchoring functions of the hydrophobic subunits and not on their catalytic competence (Table II). To compare catalytic efficiencies, we determined turnover numbers based on the covalent FAD contents. There was marked reduction of activity in the sdh4W2/C78H mutant strain, indicating impairment of enzyme assembly or stability. Similarly, the succinate-PMS reductase activity of the sdh4W2/H99A enzyme was significantly reduced. In contrast, the activities of the remaining mutant enzymes were comparable to wild-type enzyme. These data confirm that enzyme assembly proceeds normally in these mutant strains and that the mutations do not compromise the anchoring roles of the Sdh3p and Sdh4p subunits. Quinone-dependent Enzymatic Activities of Mitochondrial Membranes—To explore the effect of the mutations on electron transfer, we assayed mitochondrial membranes for malonate-sensitive succinate-dependent reduction of exogenous quinone (Table III). The succinate-DB reductase activities of sdh3W3/H46A, sdh3W3/H46D, sdh3W3/H113A, and the sdh4W2/C78H were reduced to about half of wild-type activities, indicating that the mutations affected the interaction of the enzyme with quinone. Similarly a slight reduction in the activity of the sdh4W2/H99A enzyme was observed. In contrast, the activities of the remaining mutant enzymes were not significantly different from wild-type values. The succinate-DB reductase activities correlate well with the levels of respiratory growth seen on minimal glycerol and on semisynthetic galactose media.Table IIIQuinone-mediated enzymatic activities of isolated mitochondrial membranesSuccinate-DB reductaseaActivities are expressed as μmol of DB-mediated DCPIP reduced min-1-μmol of covalent FAD-1.Succinate-cytochrome c reductasebActivities are expressed as μmol of cytochrome c reduced min-1-μmol of covalent FAD-1.Glycerol-1-P cytochrome c reductasecActivities are expressed as nmol of cytochrome c reduced min-1 mg of protein-1.Succinate oxidasedActivities are expre"
https://openalex.org/W2059953209,"Initiation of poliovirus (PV) protein synthesis is governed by an internal ribosome entry segment structured into several domains including domain V, which is accepted to be important in PV neurovirulence because it harbors an attenuating mutation in each of the vaccine strains developed by A. Sabin. To better understand how these single point mutations exert their effects, we placed each of them into the same genomic context, that of PV type 1. Only the mutation equivalent to the Sabin type 3 strain mutation resulted in significantly reduced viral growth both in HeLa and neuroblastoma cells. This correlated with poor translation efficiency in vitro and could be explained by a structural perturbation of the domain V of the internal ribosome entry segment, as evidenced by RNA melting experiments. We demonstrated that reduced cell death observed during infection by this mutant is due to the absence of inhibition of host cell translation. We confirmed that this shut-off is correlated principally with cleavage of eIF4GII and not eIF4GI and that this cleavage is significantly impaired in the case of the defective mutant. These data support the previously reported conclusion that the 2A protease has markedly different affinities for the two eIF4G isoforms. Initiation of poliovirus (PV) protein synthesis is governed by an internal ribosome entry segment structured into several domains including domain V, which is accepted to be important in PV neurovirulence because it harbors an attenuating mutation in each of the vaccine strains developed by A.

These data support the previously reported conclusion that the 2A protease has markedly different affinities for the two eIF4G isoforms. Poliovirus (PV) 1The abbreviations used are: PV, poliovirus; IRES, internal ribosome entry segment; wt, wild type; nt, nucleotide(s); NCR, noncoding region; eIF, eucaryotic initiation factor; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate(s). is a picornavirus whose positive strand RNA genome serves directly as the template for viral protein synthesis after its introduction into the target cell. The RNA genome of ∼7400 nt is uncapped at its 5′ end and possesses an unusually long 5′ noncoding region (5′ NCR) of some 740 nt (reviewed in Ref. 1Wimmer E. Hellen C.U. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 353-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The presence of extensive secondary (and doubtless tertiary) RNA structure (see Fig. 1A) and numerous silent AUG codons in this 5′ NCR are incompatible with translation initiation via the classical cap- and 5′ end-dependent scanning mechanism. Instead, it is now well established that translation initiation on all picornavirus RNAs studied follows direct, internal entry of 40 S ribosomal subunits at an internal ribosome entry segment (IRES), consisting in PV of some 450 nt of highly structured RNA (reviewed in Ref. 2Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA. 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). Although PV IRES-driven ribosome recruitment is dependent on noncanonical translation factors, canonical eucaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) are also necessary. However, subtle differences in the forms of the eIFs required between the IRES and classical, capped cellular mRNAs allow PV to selectively block host cell translation, while translation of its own RNA continues unabated. A key event in host cell shut-off by PV and other entero- and rhinoviruses is cleavage of the eIF4G component of the eIF4F complex by the viral 2A protease (3Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar). This cleavage separates eIF4E (the cap-binding protein) from the eIF3 complex responsible for contacting the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Thus, cap-dependent translation initiation is abolished without a loss of PV IRES activity, which functions efficiently with the fragment of eIF4G that binds eIF3 (4Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar). PV is a neuropathogenic virus that is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and which specifically destroys the motorneurons of the central nervous system in approximately 1% of infections causing paralytic poliomyelitis (5Minor P.D. Nathanson N. Viral Pathogenesis. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1997: 555-574Google Scholar). During the 1950s, two types of PV vaccines were developed. The first was an injectable formaldehyde-inactivated virus preparation (6Salk J.E. Lancet. 1960; 2: 715-723Abstract PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The second involved oral administration of live-attenuated vaccine strains (7Sabin A.B. Boulger L.R. J. Biol. Standardization. 1973; 1: 115-118Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which are capable of growing efficiently in many cell lines but not in neuronal cells. Despite distribution problems imposed by the maintenance of the cold chain, the oral Sabin PV vaccine has been widely used in developing countries because of its efficacy and ease of administration, and its use has contributed significantly toward the forthcoming global elimination of PV. However, despite intensive studies, the molecular mechanism of attenuation of these vaccine strains still remains unclear (reviewed in Ref. 8Malnou C.E. Kean K.M. Curr. Topics Virol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Among the mutations that the attenuated viruses harbor in their genomes compared with their virulent counterparts, only certain mutations are directly responsible for the attenuated phenotype (for review, see Refs. 5Minor P.D. Nathanson N. Viral Pathogenesis. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1997: 555-574Google Scholar and 9Blondel B. Duncan G. Couderc T. Delpeyroux F. Pavio N. Colbere-Garapin F. J. Neurovirol. 1998; 4: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Remarkably, for each vaccine strain, a major attenuating mutation is located in a remarkably similar position within domain V of the IRES (see Fig. 1B). These mutations are an A to G transition at nt 480 for PV Sabin 1, a G to A transition at nt 481 for type 2, and a C to U transition at nt 472 for type 3. It is thus tempting to propose that viral attenuation is due to a decrease in the efficiency of IRES-driven translation, caused by a destabilization of the RNA structure of domain V. In effect, it has been shown that PV attenuation could be correlated with less efficient translation initiation of the vaccine strains compared with their parents, a property that is exaggerated in cells of neuronal origin (10Svitkin Y.V. Maslova S.V. Agol V.I. Virology. 1985; 147: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, for PV Sabin 3, the mutation at nt 472 alone was proven to be sufficient for this reduced translational capacity (11Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Maslova S.V. Agol V.I. Virology. 1988; 166: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Svitkin Y.V. Cammack N. Minor P.D. Almond J.W. Virology. 1990; 175: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The consequence of this mutation was suggested to be the partial destabilization of the RNA secondary structure of domain V of the IRES (13Macadam A.J. Ferguson G. Burlison J. Stone D. Skuce R. Almond J.W. Minor P.D. Virology. 1992; 189: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), leading to reduced recognition of this region by factors necessary for PV translation initiation. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that Krebs-2 cell extracts were less efficient in correcting aberrant translation initiation on the PV Sabin 1 and 3 RNAs than on the neurovirulent parental RNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) (11Svitkin Y.V. Pestova T.V. Maslova S.V. Agol V.I. Virology. 1988; 166: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Effectively, cytoplasmic extracts from permissive cells are required to increase both the efficiency and fidelity of PV RNA translation in RRL (14Dorner A.J. Semler B.L. Jackson R.J. Hanecak R. Duprey E. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 507-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One can thus imagine that the Sabin mutations alter fixation sites for IRES-specific cellular translation factors present in these cytoplasmic extracts. This is apparently the case for a PV IRES harboring the Sabin 3 domain V mutation, with respect to binding of the noncanonical translation initiation factor PTB (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein) (15Gutierrez A.L. Denova-Ocampo M. Racaniello V.R. del Angel R.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3826-3833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The impact of the Sabin mutations on the RNA secondary structure of domain V remains unclear. In the context of the predicted secondary structure model of domain V of the entero- and rhinovirus IRESs (presented in Fig. 1B for PV1, Mahoney strain (PV1(M))) (16Le S.Y. Zuker M. J. Mol.

Virology. 1989; 168: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the introduction of the Sabin mutations would be expected to have little effect. For the Sabin 1 and 3 strains, canonical Watson-Crick A-U and C-G pairs would be replaced, respectively, by relatively stable G-U and U-G pairs, and for the Sabin 2 strain, an unpaired G residue would be replaced by an A. However, several studies have predicted that the introduction of mutations near the attenuating site would destabilize domain V based on thermodynamic criteria (13Macadam A.J. Ferguson G. Burlison J.

Studies of phenotypic revertant viruses have demonstrated that neurovirulence was recovered if RNA predicted secondary structure was re-established (13Macadam A.J. Ferguson G. Burlison J. Stone D. Skuce R. Almond J.W. Minor P.D. Virology. 1992; 189: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Gutierrez A.L. Denova-Ocampo M. Racaniello V.R. del Angel R.M. J.

In this study, we examined the question of whether the Sabin attenuating mutations in the IRES are serotype-specific (i.e. if they only act at a precise position in a given genomic context) or whether they could be transferred from one PV serotype to another. The relationship between structure and function was evaluated for IRESs carrying each mutation equivalent to the attenuating mutations. Importantly, the data presented here suggest that deleterious effects are observed for the mutant carrying the mutation equivalent to the Sabin 3 mutation. These effects are due in part to an impaired cleavage of eIF4G, which resulted from a reduced rate of translation initiation (and 2A protease accumulation) after infection. Bacteria, Bacteriophage, and Plasmid Constructions—Two Escherichia coli strains were employed, using standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar): TG1 for plasmid propagation and RZ1032 for production of phagemid single-stranded DNA for site-directed mutagenesis. The bacteriophage M13 R408 was used as a helper virus. First, domains V (nt 448–556 of PV1(M)) and IV+V (nt 234–556 of PV1(M)) were amplified by PCR using the infectious cDNA clone pT7-PV1–52 (23Marc D. Drugeon G. Haenni A.L. Girard M. van der Werf S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as the template or the cDNA clone pAM510Ab kindly provided by A. Martin (containing the PV1(M) cDNA with nt 2759–2785 of PV2 Lansing strain and carrying the Sabin 1 mutation at nt 480 (24Martin A. Benichou D. Couderc T. Hogle J.M. Wychowski C. Van der Werf S. Girard M. Virology. 1991; 180: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)) to engineer domain V with the sab1 mutation. The primers used were 5′-CGGCCCCTGAATGCGGC-3′ (nt 448–464 of PV1(M)) or 5′-AAGCTTATGTACTTCGAGAA-3′ (nt 234–253 of PV1(M)) and 5′-CGGATCCGGACACCCAAAG-3′ (antisense, nt 556–544 of PV1(M) with a BamHI site precisely at the 3′ end of domain V). PCR conditions were 1 min 20 s at 94 °C; then 30 cycles of: 35 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C; followed by a final incubation of 10 min at 72 °C, using PerkinElmer Life Sciences PCR buffer, 200 μm dNTPs, 500 nm primers, and 2–3 units/100 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR products were cloned directly into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega), giving the pGTe-V or pGTe-IV+V series of phagemids. pGTe-V-wt and pGTe-IV+V-wt phagemids were used as templates for site-specific mutagenesis based on the principle of bacteriophage M13 mutagenesis (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) to give the series of pGTe-V or pGTe-IV+V mutants carrying the Sabin mutations at position 481 (sab2) and 469 (sab3; the equivalent position of PV3 nt 472) (see Fig. 1B). For mutagenesis, the primers were 5′-CAACCTCGGAACAGGTGGTC-3′ (nt 471–490 of PV1(M), for sab2 mutants) and 5′-GCGGCTAATTCCAACCTCGG-3′ (nt 460–479 of PV1(M), for sab3 mutants). The pGTe-IV+V plasmid containing the sab3 mutation was obtained by transfer of the BsmI/BamHI restriction fragment (nt 462–556) of the pGTe-V-sab3 plasmid into the pGTe-IV+V-wt plasmid. The second step of plasmid construction was to transfer the BlpI/PflMI restriction fragments (nt 286–502 of PV1(M)) of the pGTe-IV+V plasmids into the pKK-C2 plasmid, which contains the PV1(M) sequence deleted for nt 2547–6303 (26Borman A.M. Deliat F.G. Kean K.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3149-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), to produce the pKK series of plasmids used for in vitro translation assays. Third, the mutated SalI/NheI restriction fragments (containing nt 1–2468 of PV1(M)) of the pKK plasmids were introduced into the full-length cDNA clone pT7-PV1–52, giving the pPV series of plasmids. Finally, to engineer the pV plasmids used for RNA melting experiments, the EcoRI/BamHI restriction fragments containing the mutated domain V were transferred from the pGTe-V plasmids into the pGEM-1 vector (Promega). Cells, Transfections, and Infections—HeLa monolayer cells and IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 5 and 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. For transfection into HeLa cells, pPV plasmids were first linearized by EcoRI and then in vitro transcribed in KH2PO4/K2HPO4 buffer using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase exactly as described previously (27Teterina N.L. Kean K.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. Girard M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Monolayers of HeLa cells in 35-mm plates (106 cells/plate) were used for transfection in the presence of DEAE-dextran as described previously (27Teterina N.L. Kean K.M. Gorbalenya A.E. Agol V.I. Girard M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Transfection under semi-solid medium (0.9% noble agar) served to determine the specific infectivity of in vitro transcribed RNAs and to obtain plaque-purified virus, which was amplified once in HeLa cells to give viral stocks. Viral phenotypes were determined by plaque assay on HeLa cells at 37 and 40 °C (28Malnou C.E. Poyry T.A. Jackson R.J. Kean K.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10617-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To sequence viral stocks, cytoplasmic RNA extracted from infected monolayers of HeLa cells served as a template for reverse transcription from the antisense nt 846 followed by PCR between nt 67 and 846. The DNA product obtained was then sequenced automatically from nt 67 to 615 using a BigDye Terminator kit (Amersham Biosciences). One-step growth curve experiments were performed in IMR-32 cells at 37 and 40 °C, after infection at a multiplicity of infection of 10 as determined by titration of virus stocks on HeLa cells, as described previously (28Malnou C.E. Poyry T.A. Jackson R.J. Kean K.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10617-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Virus titers were determined by the end point dilution method (29Reed Am. J. Hygiene. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar) on HeLa cell monolayers at 37 °C. In Vitro Translation—Purified plasmids of the pKK series were linearized by EcoRI, and RNA was transcribed in vitro in Tris buffer using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (28Malnou C.E. Poyry T.A. Jackson R.J. Kean K.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10617-10626Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RNA preparations were purified on G-50 Sephadex spin columns (Roche Applied Science) prior to ethanol precipitation. In vitro translation reactions were carried out in nuclease-treated RRL (Flexi; Promega) (30Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) supplemented with increasing concentrations (from 0 to 20%) of HeLa or IMR-32 cell S10 extracts prepared and treated with micrococcal nuclease as described (31Ziegler E. Borman A.M. Deliat F.G. Liebig H.D. Jugovic D. Kean K.M. Skern T. Kuechler E. Virology. 1995; 213: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Added MgCl2 was maintained constant at 0.33 mm, whereas total added KCl was optimized according to the batch of RRL used, varying from 75 to 95.5 mm. The reactions were programmed with uncapped mRNAs at concentrations from 5 to 20 μg/ml and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Translation products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using gels containing 23% (w/v) polyacrylamide. Dried gels were exposed to Biomax Film (Kodak) typically for 2 days. Quantification of translation products was carried out by densitometry of autoradiograms using NIH image software, using multiple exposures of the gels to ensure that the linear response range of the film was respected. RNA Melting Experiments—Purified plasmids of the pV series were linearized with SalI (15 nt downstream of the end of domain V) prior to transcription in Tris buffer as for in vitro translation. RNA concentration was adjusted to 0.2 μm in 10 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) (32Brion P. Schroeder R. Michel F. Westhof E. RNA. 1999; 5: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In experiments involving the addition of monovalent cations, EDTA was added to 0.5 mm to remove any traces of divalent cations. UV melting curves were measured on a Uvikon XL spectrophotometer equipped with two racks connected to a temperature control unit and a computer running the LifePower TM Junior software (both Biotek). 500 μl of sample was sealed in each cuvette with a layer of mineral oil and a Teflon stopper. Annealing took place directly in the cuvette; to ensure reproducibility, we routinely measured three heating/cooling cycles at a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min, and data from the first cycle was discarded. Precipitation of RNA and separation on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea followed by staining with toluidine blue revealed no significant RNA degradation after three heating cycles. The data were collected from 20 to 80 °C at 0.5 °C intervals. Data analysis was performed using Kaleidagraph 3.5 and Microsoft Excel software packages. The raw data was separated into single heating or cooling runs and interpolated to obtain uniform data sets. The derivative of the absorbance as a function of temperature was calculated using the locally weighted least squared error method provided by the Kaleidagraph program. The resulting melting profiles were normalized and plotted versus temperature. The curves shown are averaged over two or three heating-cooling cycles each. Ex Vivo Translation Experiments and Western Blotting Analysis— For ex vivo translation experiments, monolayers of HeLa cells in 35-mm plates (106 cells/well) were infected with different mutants at a multiplicity of infection of 10. After 30 min of adsorption, 2 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without serum containing 2.5 μg/ml actinomycin D, to inhibit cellular transcription, were added. We ruled out the possibility that the sab mutant viruses had acquired an increased sensitivity to actinomycin D, compared with the wild type. To this end, global virus production was measured after infection at an multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell in the absence of actinomycin D or in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml of this drug (data not shown). Infected HeLa cells were incubated for 0.5–10 h at 37 °C. 30 min before the desired time post-infection, the cells were depleted of methionine, and then 24 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences; >1000 Ci/mmol) were added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. The cells were then lysed using 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (33Bellocq C. Agut H. van der Werf S.F. Girard M. Virology. 1984; 139: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After centrifugation of the lysed cells to remove nuclei (12000 rpm, 3 min), 1/20 of the cytoplasmic extract was loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 23% (w/v) polyacrylamide and analyzed by autoradiography. Western blot analyses of eIF4GI and II were performed on ex vivo translation reactions exactly as described previously (4Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 186-196PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were the ZP1 antibody kindly provided by R. E. Rhoads, which detects intact eIF4GI and its N-terminal cleavage product, and the #2119 antibody kindly provided by N. Sonenberg, which detects intact eIF4GII and its C-terminal cleavage product. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Biosciences). Numerous mutations distinguish each of the neurovirulent strains of PV from their attenuated counterparts. Some of these mutations contribute directly to the attenuated phenotype of these vaccine strains (for a review, see Ref. 8Malnou C.E. Kean K.M. Curr. Topics Virol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutation located in domain V of the IRES (Fig. 1A) is present in all of these attenuated strains, at a remarkably similar position within a 13-nt region of this domain (Fig. 1B). To test the impact of each of these mutations in domain V alone on the PV phenotype, we have constructed mutants that carry only the mutations equivalent to the sabin mutations found in domain V of each of the vaccine strains, based on primary sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions, and in the same genomic context, that of PV1(M). In this way, we could also evaluate whether each attenuating mutation was PV strain-specific or whether this phenotype was attributable to a global perturbation of domain V of the IRES because of a single mutation, which is transposable to another PV genomic context. Consequently, the three sab mutations were introduced into the equivalent position of the PV1(M) genome: A480 → G for the sab1 mutant, G481 → A for the sab2 mutant, and C469 → U for the sab3 mutant (Fig. 1B and see “Experimental Procedures”). Infectivity of the Mutant Viruses—To study the growth capacities of these mutants, HeLa cell monolayers were transfected with RNA transcripts synthesized in vitro from the full-length mutated cDNAs. The specific infectivities calculated for the PV1 sab1 and sab2 mutants were similar to the wild type, in contrast to the PV1 sab3 mutant, which showed 1 log less infectivity (Table I). This suggested that the PV1 sab3 virus, although still viable, was handicapped as compared with the others. Sequencing of the RNA of virus stocks used for further experiments showed that in all cases the expected mutation had been retained, and no other mutation had accumulated within the IRES (data not shown). However, because the entire viral genomes were not sequenced, it cannot be ruled out that mutations had accumulated elsewhere. Indeed, in the 2A protease gene, which was sequenced, a C to A change was found in the case of the PV1sab3 virus at position 381. Although it cannot be formally excluded that this is a deleterious mutation, it seems unlikely because no amino acid change in the 2A protease results from this change.Table ISpecific infectivities of mutant viruses calculated after transfection of HeLa cells under semi-solid mediumVirusesSpecific infectivityaThe values given are measured in plaque-forming units/μg of RNA.wt3 × 105sab12 × 105sab22 × 105sab33 × 104a The values given are measured in plaque-forming units/μg of RNA. Open table in a new tab The phenotypic properties of the mutant viruses produced after transfection were determined in HeLa cells by infecting these cells under semi-solid medium to observe the plaque phenotypes of the viruses. The sab1 and sab2 mutants exhibited a large plaque phenotype at 37 °C, comparable with wild type virus. In contrast, the sab3 mutant gave a pronounced small plaque phenotype, indicating that its growth was severely affected in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). To test the temperature sensitivity of these viruses, the plaque assay was repeated at 33 and 40 °C. The results obtained were comparable with those observed at 37 °C, both in terms of virus titers and relative plaque phenotypes (data not shown). These mutant viruses are thus apparently not temperature-sensitive in HeLa cells. We next determined the growth capacities of these viruses in IMR-32 cells, which derive from a middle-differentiated human neuroblastoma, to evaluate whether the mutations had cell type-specific effects. IMR-32 cells adhere poorly to culture dishes, so we were unable to classically test plaque phenotype under semi-solid medium. Instead one-step growth curve experiments were performed, collecting the intracellular viruses produced by IMR-32 cells infected at 37 and 40 °C, from 0 to 18 h post-infection. Virus production at each time point was determined on HeLa cells by the end point dilution method (Fig. 3). For the wild type virus, three phases of infection were evidenced: the eclipse phase, which occurs upon adsorption of the virus and entry; a period of intense viral production attaining a peak at 10 h post infection; and finally a decrease in the measured viral production caused by lysis of the infected cells (Fig. 3, black squares). The sab1 and sab2 mutants showed growth curves with a similar profile to the wild type virus at the two temperatures tested, with a maximum titer that was only 1 log less than the wild type, indicating a slightly affected multiplication in IMR-32 cells. In contrast, the sab3 mutant had a significantly delayed infectious cycle at 37 °C compared with the wild type and had still not reached a plateau between 10 and 18 h post infection, although it was at the maximum wild type titer at this latter time (Fig. 3, open circles). At 40 °C, its growth was even more handicapped because titers never reached the wild type level and in fact remained approximately 2 logs less than that of the wild type throughout the infectious cycle. The Altered Growth of the sab3 Mutant Correlates with a Translational Defect—To determine whether the altered growth observed for the sab3 mutant in the two cell lines was due to a translational defect, we examined the in vitro translational capacities of these mutants. Plasmids lacking a large portion of the open reading frame of the PV1(M) genome were used to this end, because translation of RNAs derived from such plasmids results in the synthesis of a single translation product that is not proteolytically processed. Quantification of translation efficiency is thus significantly facilitated (see “Experimental Procedures”). In vitro translation assays were performed in a RRL-based system supplemented with increasing concentrations of cytoplasmic S10 extracts from HeLa (Fig. 4A) or IMR-32 (Fig. 4B) cells with low doses of RNA (5 μg/ml), which were found to be more discriminating than higher RNA doses (10 or 20 μg/ml, data not shown). The addition of cytoplasmic extracts from HeLa or IMR-32 cells provides the noncanonical initiation factors necessary for optimal"
https://openalex.org/W2082539282,"The heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) kinase (HRI) regulates the initiation of protein synthesis in reticulocytes. The binding of NO to the N-terminal heme-binding domain (NTD) of HRI positively modulates its kinase activity. By utilizing UV-visible absorption, resonance Raman, EPR and CD spectroscopies, two histidine residues have been identified that are crucial for the binding of heme to the NTD. The UV-visible absorption and resonance Raman spectra of all the histidine to alanine mutants constructed were similar to those of the unmutated NTD. However, the change in the CD spectra of the NTD construct containing mutation of His78 to Ala (H78A) indicated loss of the specific binding of heme. The EPR spectrum for the ferric H78A mutant was also substantially perturbed. Thus, His78 is one of the axial ligands for the NTD of HRI. Significant changes in the EPR spectrum of the H123A mutant were also observed, and heme readily dissociated from both the H123A and the H78A NTD mutants, suggesting that His123 was also an axial heme ligand. However, the CD spectrum for the Soret region of the H123A mutant indicated that this mutant still bound heme specifically. Thus, while both His78 and His123 are crucial for stable heme binding, the effects of their mutations on the structure of the NTD differed. His78 appears to play the primary role in the specific binding of heme to the NTD, acting analogously to the “proximal histidine” ligand of globins, while His123 appears to act as the “distal” heme ligand.

The heme-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor-2α; HRI, heme-regulated eIF2α kinase; NTD, N-terminal heme-binding domain. kinase (HRI) is a member of a family of kinases that regulate initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. HRI functions, in part, to coordinate the synthesis of globin chains in reticulocytes with heme availability (1Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A deficiency of heme, which is required for the assembly of α- and β-globin chains into hemoglobin, induces the activation of HRI, which subsequently phosphorylates the α-subunit of eIF2, leading to the inhibition of polypeptide chain initiation and the arrest of protein synthesis. HRI is a multidomain hemoprotein that contains two distinct heme-binding sites (2Chefalo P.J. Oh J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Kan B. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One site, which has been tentatively assigned as being located in the “kinase insertion domain” of HRI, appears to bind heme “reversibly” and regulates HRI activity in response to changes in heme concentration (3Rafie-Kolpin M. Chefalo J.J. Hussain Z. Hahn J. Uma S. Matts R.L. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5171-5178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The other heme-binding site is located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of HRI, which consists of ∼165 amino acids (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This domain is responsible for the stable “constitutive” binding of heme to HRI (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and appears to be the active center for nitric oxide (NO)-induced activation of HRI (5Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The isolated NTD stably binds heme but shows no kinase activity (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of HRI is coded by the C-terminal region (2Chefalo P.J. Oh J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Kan B. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The isolated C-terminal region has the “reversible” heme-binding site and phosphorylation activity, but it does not respond to NO. Although axial ligands for the heme-binding sites have not yet been determined, sequence alignment of the NTD to globins (5Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and preliminary spectroscopic analyses of the NTD (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) suggested that histidine was the axial ligand of the heme-binding site in the NTD. In the presence of NO, heme in the NTD forms a six-coordinate NO complex (5Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The formation of this six-coordinate NO-Fe-His complex is of interest, because it differs from what occurs in the prototypical NO-responsive sensor protein, soluble guanylate cyclase. In soluble guanylate cyclase, the binding of NO to the heme iron induces cleavage of the iron-histidyl bond to form a five-coordinate NO complex, which is postulated to be the primary trigger for the activation of its cyclase activity (7Deinum G. Stone J.R. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1540-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, we have shown that the iron-histidyl bond is retained in the NO adduct of the NTD (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This observation has led us to propose that changes in the conformation of amino acid residues adjacent to the NO binding site (the “distal” heme ligand), not cleavage of the axial histidine ligand at the “proximal” side of the heme-binding site, would be crucial for the NO-induced activation mechanism in HRI (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine the axial ligands in the NTD, we prepared point mutants substituting Ala for His at each of the seven histidine residues present in the NTD of rabbit HRI (His78, His81, His83, His122, His123, His129, and His148) (5Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Two of the residues (His78 and His123) are invariant amino acids from zebrafish to human and the other four histidines (His81, His83, His122, and His129) are conserved in mammalian HRIs (Table I). In addition, we prepared another mutant in which Gln58, which molecular modeling suggested might be equivalent to the distal histidine ligand of globins (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was replaced with Ala. Using a combination of these mutations in the NTD with UV-visible absorption, resonance Raman, EPR and CD spectroscopies, His78 and His123 were identified as being two crucial residues for the ligation of heme within the NTD of HRI.Table IAlignment of the NTDs of HRI Symbols beneath the sequences indicate::, conservative amino acid changes in seven species;., conserved amino acids in mammalians; *, conserved amino acids in seven species.

The unmutated and mutated NTDs of HRI were purified as described previously (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with some modifications. To avoid nonspecific heme binding, the (His)5-tag was cleaved by enterokinase (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the cleavage of the (His)5-tag was confirmed by the N-terminal amino acid analysis and SDS-PAGE. The spectroscopic data obtained with the proteins from which the (His)5-tag was cleaved were identical to the data obtained from (His)5-tag fused proteins, as reported previously (5Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The heme concentration was determined by the pyridine hemochromogen assay (8Paul K.G. Theorell H. Akeson A. Acta Chem. Scand. 1953; 7: 1284-1287Crossref Google Scholar), and the heme content was estimated by the absorption ratio of the Soret peak to 280 nm (ASoret/A280 nm). We observed that the ASoret/A280 nm for the recombinant NTD is about 4.5. However, heme dissociated from the His78, His122, and His123 mutants during the purification. The ASoret/A280 nm for these mutant proteins were at least 1.5, indicating that more than 30% of the heme binding sites were occupied by heme. The destabilized protein structure and weak heme affinity of these mutants prevented further purification. Spectroscopy—The UV-visible absorption and CD spectra of the purified NTD and its mutants were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer lambda 19 and a Jasco model 720 spectrometers, respectively, at room temperature. Proteins at a concentration of 5-10 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) were placed in a cuvette (1-cm cell length). The ellipticity in the CD spectra was normalized by the heme concentration, and the presence of the apoprotein did not affect the CD spectra for the Soret region. Resonance Raman spectra were measured using the system and the method reported previously (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The EPR spectra of the NTD and its mutants were measured at 15 K with a Varian E-12 spectrometer (X-band; 9.22 GHz) equipped with an Oxford ESR-900 liquid helium flow cryostat. The sample concentration for the EPR measurements was 200 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5. As reported previously (5Uma S. Yun B.G. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the ferric NTD exhibited a UV-visible absorption spectrum with a Soret peak at 415 nm and two bands at 534 and 565 nm in the visible region, which is characteristic of the low spin state in which two axial ligands are ligated to the heme iron. A similar UV-visible spectrum was also encountered for ferric cytochrome b5, a typical bishistidine-ligated hemoprotein (9Rivera M. Barillas-Mury C. Christensen K.A. Little J.W. Wells M.A. Walker F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12233-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Table II). While the resonance Raman spectrum of the ferric NTD exhibited a weak ν3 line at 1473 cm-1, implying the presence of a five-coordinate heme species, an intense ν3 line characteristic of a six-coordinate heme species was observed at 1506 cm-1 (Table III). Thus, the ferric state of the recombinant NTD has a six-coordinate heme species as its major component.Table IIAbsorption maxima of unmutated and mutated NTDs of HRIs in 50 mm Tris-HCl, at pH 7.5Peak positionsFe(III)Fe(II)Fe(II)-COnmRecombinantaRef. 6415534565bShoulder peak429532562424539565Q58A415534565bShoulder peak430532562424538566H78A418539569bShoulder peak425530559421537560H81A415534565bShoulder peak430532562424540570H83A415534565bShoulder peak429532562424538564H122A414531565bShoulder peak430532562424539570H123A414536565bShoulder peak426530560421538563H129A415534565bShoulder peak429532562423539571H148A415534565bShoulder peak429532562424539571Cytochrome b5cRef. 9412533562bShoulder peak423525556-d-, not formed--a Ref. 6Ishikawa H.

Although the Soret peak of the ferrous recombinant NTD was red-shifted, compared with that of ferrous cytochrome b5, and was rather close to that of five-coordinate species, such as deoxymyoglobin (534 nm), the clear presence of two peaks in the visible region of the UV-visible absorption spectrum (Table II) indicated that the ferrous recombinant NTD was predominantly in the six-coordinate state, as we reported previously (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The intense ν3 line at 1492 cm-1 in the resonance Raman spectrum (Table III) supports the conclusion that the six-coordinate state was the major species present in the ferrous state of the recombinant NTD, while a very weak ν3 line at 1468 cm-1 suggested that a minor amount of five-coordinate heme was also present. For the CO adduct of the recombinant NTD, the correlation between the stretching lines of Fe-C and FeC-O showed that the ligand trans to CO was neutral (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 10Li X.Y. Spiro T.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 6024-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although the UV-visible absorption and resonance Raman spectra cannot unambiguously identify the neutral axial ligands in the recombinant NTD, additional data presented below suggest that the most probable amino acid residue for the axial ligands is histidine. Unexpectedly, the UV-visible absorption spectra of the mutated NTDs, whose maxima are summarized in Table II, indicate that the His to Ala mutations did not highly perturb the spectral pattern. However, detailed inspection revealed that the His78 mutant has a red-shifted Soret peak in the ferric state, while the Soret peak in the ferrous and ferrous-CO states was blue-shifted. The His123 mutant also showed enhanced spectral shifts. While the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the ferric His123 mutant was quite similar to that of the unmutated NTD, significant peak shifts, as found for the His78 mutant, were observed for the ferrous and ferrous-CO states. The spectral differences of the His78 and His123 mutants from the unmutated NTD were more evident in the CD spectra. Fig. 1A shows the CD spectra of the Soret region for the ferric NTDs. Except for the His78 and His123 mutants, the mutants showed CD spectra similar to the unmutated NTD, exhibiting a positive peak around 400 nm and a negative peak at 417 nm. In sharp contrast to the spectrum of the unmutated NTD, the CD spectrum of the His78 mutant was almost featureless. The disappearance of the ellipticity corresponds to the loss of the optical asymmetry of the heme, implying nonspecific binding of heme to the His78 mutant (11Hsu M.C. Woody R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). His78 is, therefore, crucial for the specific binding of heme, and it may be an axial ligand for the ferric heme iron in the NTD. On the other hand, the His123 mutant gave an intense positive peak at 412 nm and no negative peak in the Soret region. Although some other mutants showed deviations of the peak positions and intensities probably due to the slight structural perturbation around the heme and/or uncertainty of the heme concentrations, the spectral changes in the His123 mutant were distinct and the mutation at His123 significantly perturbed the heme environment of the ferric NTD. However, the effects of the His123 mutation were different from those of His78. The intense peak in the CD spectrum of the His123 mutant indicated that the mutation did not abolish the specific binding of heme. Thus, His123 might be the other axial ligand to the heme iron with the contribution of His123 to the specific binding of heme to the NTD being less significant than that of His78. The differences between the effects of the His78 and His123 mutations were more enhanced in the ferrous state of the NTD. In the ferrous state, the recombinant NTD gave a positive peak at 418 nm and a negative peak at 427 nm (Fig. 1B). The CD spectrum of the His78 mutant also had no intense signals in the Soret region, as observed for the ferric state, indicating that His78 was ligated to the ferrous heme iron in the NTD. However, the spectral changes in the ferrous His123 mutant were less drastic than those in the ferric state. The spectral pattern of the ferrous His123 mutant is essentially the same as that of the unmutated NTD. The structural changes induced by the mutation at His123 appear to be relieved by the reduction of the heme. Thus, the ligation of His123 to the ferrous heme iron has only limited contribution to the structural environment of the bound heme, or the reduction of the heme iron might cause His123 to dissociate from the heme iron. The positive and negative peaks in the CD spectrum of the recombinant NTD were blue-shifted to 413 and 422 nm, respectively, upon addition of CO to the ferrous state of the NTD (Fig. 1C). The His78 mutant still showed very weak ellipticity and no clear peaks in the spectrum. Such drastic changes in the CD spectra of His78 mutant lead us to conclude that His78 is the essential axial ligand, which is required for the specific binding of heme to the NTD, corresponding to the proximal histidine in globins. On the other hand, the similarities between the CD spectra of the ferrous-CO state of the unmutated and the His123-mutated NTD (Fig. 1C) indicated that specific binding of heme was maintained without the ligation of His123. However, during the purification of the His123 mutant, we noted that dissociation of heme from its heme-binding site was enhanced, indicating that the affinity of the His123 mutant for heme was decreased to the same extent as was found for the His78 mutant. Thus, the ligation of heme by His123 appears to be required for stabilizing the specific binding of heme to the NTD. Such nonequivalent contributions of two axial ligands to the structural environment of the heme-binding site are also encountered in cytochrome b5 (12Ihara M. Takahashi S. Ishimroi K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5961-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mutation of one axial ligand, His39, resulted in minor spectral changes and formation of a rather stable hemoprotein, while the replacement of the other axial ligand, His63, induced severe destabilization of the protein structure and decreased the heme binding affinity of the protein (12Ihara M. Takahashi S. Ishimroi K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5961-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Based on the heme binding and spectroscopic data for the two axial mutants of cytochrome b5, we had proposed that His63 plays a primary role for the binding of heme to cytochrome b5 and acts in a manner analogous to the proximal histidine in globin, while His39 would correspond to the “distal histidine”, with ligation of His39 to the heme iron being critical for the electron transfer reaction catalyzed by cytochrome b5 and not for heme binding (12Ihara M. Takahashi S. Ishimroi K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5961-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To further examine the roles of the axial histidines in determining the structural environmental of the heme-binding site, the resonance Raman spectra were measured. Unexpectedly, most of the stretching modes of the porphyrin ring in the spectra of the His78 and His123 mutants could be superimposed on those of the unmutated NTD (Table III). Compared with the spectral changes reported for the axial ligand mutants in other hemoproteins (13Hirst J. Wilcox S.K. Ai J. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Gooding D.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Adachi S. Nagano S. Ishimori K. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Egawa T. Kitagawa T. Makino R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Hori H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), one might conclude that such small spectral changes would not reflect the substitution of the axial ligands for the heme iron of the NTD. However, it should be noted here that the NTD has histidine residues adjacent to the positions of His78 and His123: His81 and His83 are located near His78, and His122 is located next to His123. These histidines may coordinate to the heme iron instead of His78 or His123, resulting in the slight changes in the resonance Raman spectra. With respect to the His122 mutant, heme was also observed to dissociate during its purification, indicating that this residue plays some role in maintaining the integrity of the heme-binding site. For the His78 mutant, loss of the intrinsic axial ligand would severely perturb the structural environment of the heme-binding site. Ligation of an alternate axial ligand may allow variations in the orientation of the bound heme, leading to the loss of the “specific binding” of heme and no clear peaks in the CD spectrum of mutant. Mutation of His83 to Gln has previously demonstrated that this residue plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the heme binding site (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This observation further supports the hypothesis that the region of the NTD containing His78 corresponds to the proximal side of the heme-binding site. The EPR spectrum for the ferric state of the mutants also supports the notion that His78 and His123 are ligated to the heme iron. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the EPR spectrum for the ferric state of the unmutated NTD showed g values at 3.07, 2.20, and 1.46, which is typical of the low spin bishistidineligated heme (16Bois-Poltorasky R. Ehrenberg A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), although a low intensity signal at approximately g = 6 assignable to the high spin species was detected. In the spectrum of the His78 mutant (Fig. 2B), the low spin gy and gz signals were shifted to g = 2.27 and g = 2.97, respectively, and a broad gx signal appeared around g = 1.5. These g shifts of the low spin signals were also encountered for the His123 mutant (Fig. 2F). Some additional signals around g = 2.4 and g = 1.9 were detected for both of the mutants, but these signals were also found in the spectrum of the partially purified recombinant protein (figure not shown). These signals may originate from a partially denatured form of the protein, with these signals being enhanced in the His78 and His123 mutants due to their destabilized structures. The low spin EPR signals were slightly shifted in the His81 and His83 mutants as well. However, distinct changes in the EPR spectra were only observed for the His78 and His123 mutants. Thus, the His81 or His83 mutations likely caused minor changes in the coordination structure of His78, leading to the subtle changes in the EPR spectra. Although the structural perturbations responsible for the changes in the EPR spectra of the His78 and His123 mutants are not yet fully understood, the g shifts of the low spin signal at gz = 3.07 to gz = 2.97 and gz = 2.95 in the His78 and His123 mutants, respectively, imply that the these mutants still have a bishistidine-ligated heme, but the rhombicity of the electronic state of the ferric heme iron is increased. Such alteration in the rhombicity corresponds to the displacement of His78 or His123 and the ligation of another histidine nearby, which is also suggested by the resonance Raman spectra. Despite the clear structural significance of His78 as an axial heme ligand, mutation of His78 was found to have limited effects on the NO-induced activation of HRI. The kinase activity of the His78 mutant of HRI was somewhat less sensitive to activation by NO, particularly at low NO concentrations (70% less active in the presence of 0.01 mm NOC-9, a NO generator), but the His78 mutant still showed NO-dependent phosphorylation activity. 2B.-G. Yun and R. L. Matts, unpublished results. The low sensitivity to NO in the His78 mutant would reflect some structural changes induced by the replacement of His78 with another histidine, indicating that the proper orientation of the heme moiety, which requires His78, might be also important in the mechanism by which NO activates HRI. Such limited effects of the mutation at His78 correspond to our previous suggestion (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that the NO-induced activation of HRI is primarily based on the conformational changes in the ligand binding site, not in the cleavage of the axial ligand from the protein. Previous results (6Ishikawa H. Yun B.G. Takahashi S. Hori H. Matts R.L. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 13696-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have led us to propose that changes in the conformations of amino acid residues on the distal side of the heme-binding site, which are induced by the binding of NO to the ferrous heme iron, trigger the NO-induced activation of HRI. Despite the unambiguous identification of His78 as the proximal ligand of the NTD, the identity of the amino acid residue at the NO/CO binding site, which can be referred to as the distal ligand, in the ferrous state is still uncertain. Molecular modeling based on the sequence alignment of the NTD with α-globin suggested that Gln58 might act as the distal heme-binding ligand (4Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S. Chen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 498-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, mutation of Gln58 to Ala did not induce significant spectral changes in the UV-visible absorption, CD, and EPR spectra. Comparison of the EPR spectra of the ferric unmutated NTD and the His123 mutant (Fig. 2) implies the ligation of His123 to heme in the ferric state, suggesting that the distal axial ligand in the ferrous state is His123, not Gln58. Systematic mutational studies to identify critical amino acid residues on the distal side of the heme binding site in the NTD are now in progress. We are indebted to Prof. T. Kitagawa (Institute for Molecular Science) for kind permission to use his resonance Raman spectroscopy system."

Eukaryotic gene expression is mainly regulated at the level of transcription initiation from chromatin templates (1Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 2Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 3Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). This regulation involves the orchestrated interplay of chromatin factors, gene-specific DNA-binding factors, general transcription factors, and transcription machinery elements and their interactors. Eukaryotic transcription is essentially regulated in three distinct steps. The first step is the alteration of chromatin structure through the modification and remodeling of chromatin components. A major target of the structural changes in chromatin is the nucleosome, which is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin that consists of histones and DNA in a precise stoichiometric balance. Histone modification enzymes, ATP-dependent remodeling factors, and histone chaperones are involved in regulating the histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions that lead to particular chromatin structures. Of these chromatin regulators, the tertiary structures of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), 1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; CCG1, cell cycle arrest in G1; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TAFII250, TAF with a molecular weight of 250 kDa; MOZ, monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein; Tip60, Tat-interactive protein 60; MYST, MOZ-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60; CIA, CCG1-interacting factor A; CIB, CCG1-interacting factor B; aa, amino acid(s); HCR, highly conserved region; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; CCG1, cell cycle arrest in G1; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TAFII250, TAF with a molecular weight of 250 kDa; MOZ, monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein; Tip60, Tat-interactive protein 60; MYST, MOZ-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60; CIA, CCG1-interacting factor A; CIB, CCG1-interacting factor B; aa, amino acid(s); HCR, highly conserved region; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein. histone deacetylase homologues, histone methyltransferases, and histone chaperones have been solved (4Marmorstein R.

The second step of eukaryotic transcription regulation is the binding of regulatory transcription factors to promoter/enhancer elements. The tertiary structures of numerous types of DNA-binding domains that are present in these factors have been determined, and their DNA binding interactions have also been well characterized and classified. However, structures of most transcriptional activation/regulatory domains are not yet available. This may be because such unstable activation/regulatory domains are induced to fit to the basal transcription machinery (8Zawel L. Reinberg D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The third step is the regulation of RNA polymerization by RNA polymerase II and several general transcription initiation and elongation factors (9Van Dyke M.W. Roeder R.G. Sawadogo M. Science. 1988; 241: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). One of these general transcription initiation factors is TFIID, which is known to interact with various kinds of transcription/chromatin factors and to activate transcription initiation. The tertiary structures of RNA polymerase II and general transcription initiation and elongation factors, including domains of TATA box-binding protein (TBP), TBP-associated factor (TAF), TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and S-II (TFIIS), have recently been determined (11Woychik N.A. Hampsey M. Cell. 2002; 108: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which the activated general transcription initiation and elongation factors regulate RNA polymerization are not yet fully understood.TFIID is a multiprotein complex that is composed of TBP (12Horikoshi M.

TFIID binds to the TATA box of the core promoter and initiates transcription by forming the preinitiation complex with other general transcription initiation factors and RNA polymerase II (9Van Dyke M.W. Roeder R.G. Sawadogo M. Science. 1988; 241: 1335-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). It also interacts with various kinds of regulatory transcription factors as well as cofactors and activates transcription in cooperation with these elements (15Horikoshi M. Carey M.F. Kakidani H.

Cell. 1988; 54: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Some studies suggest that TFIID also plays a key role in regulating transcription from a chromatin DNA template. In one of these studies, it was found that the binding of TFIID to the TATA box of the core promoter during nucleosome assembly potentiates the subsequent initiation by RNA polymerase II (18Workman J.L. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1987; 51: 613-622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Moreover, crystallographic analyses have revealed that there are multiple histone-fold pairs in TFIID (19Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Moras D.

In addition, a biochemical study has suggested that a subset of four yeast histone-fold TAFs forms a histone-fold octamer (21Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).The largest subunit of TFIID (22Hisatake K. Hasegawa S. Takada R. Nakatani Y. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1993; 362: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Ruppert S. Wang E.H. Tjian R. Nature. 1993; 362: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) is CCG1/TAFII250. CCG1 and TAFII250 are acronyms. CCG1 stands for cell cycle arrest in G1, and TAFII250 stands for TATA box-binding protein-associated factor with a molecular weight of 250 kDa. It has been reported that CCG1 has three enzymatic activities, namely, HAT activity (24Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), histone H1-specific ubiquitin-activating/conjugating activity (25Pham A.D. Sauer F. Science. 2000; 289: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and protein kinase activity (26Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). CCG1 has two bromodomains that are also found in various chromatin factors and that bind to the acetylated amino-terminal tails of histones (27Jacobson R.H. Ladurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). These structural and functional observations indicate that the function of CCG1 is closely related to the alteration of chromatin structure. In addition, cell lines that express CCG1 bearing an amino acid substitution suffer cell cycle arrest that leads to apoptosis, which suggests that CCG1 plays a role in growth and apoptosis (28Sekiguchi T. Miyata T. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1683-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Considering the characteristics of TFIID described above, we speculated that the molecules that interact with TFIID are likely to be chromatin factors and/or transcriptional regulators/cofactors. Indeed, when we isolated and characterized various TFIID interactors, we found that one of the TAF interactors is a MOZ-Ybf2/Sas3-Sas2-Tip60 (MYST)-type HAT denoted as Tip60 (Tat-interactive protein 60) (29Yamamoto T.

These proteins are highly conserved among various species, and they regulate several nuclear events, including DNA replication, DNA repair, transcription, silencing, and apoptosis, which indicates that they play important roles in regulating chromatin.When we screened for proteins that interact with the conserved HAT domain of CCG1 by using the yeast two-hybrid system, we also identified the novel factor CCG1-interacting factor B (CIB). The primary sequence of CIB does not show any similarities to those of any of the transcription/chromatin factors known to date. To understand the functional role of CIB, we have determined the crystal structure of CIB refined at 2.2-Å resolution. These data are reported here. The presented structure shows a fold that is similar to one found in prokaryotic α/β-hydrolase family proteins, even though these proteins show very little sequence homology with CIB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screen—We isolated the cDNA of CIB (70-210 aa) during a yeast two-hybrid screen (38Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar) that aimed to search for factors that interact with CCG1 (GenBank™/EBI accession number Q96IU4). A full-length clone (1-210 aa) of CIB was isolated by plaque hybridization using a partial CIB clone as a probe. The coding sequence of its cDNA was also identified in the mouse expressed sequence tag data bases (accession number Q8VCR7). DNA encoding a highly conserved region (HCR) of the human CCG1 protein (447-1112 aa) was cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in pAS1-CYH2 using NdeI and BamHI sites to make the pAS1-CYH2-CCG1-HCR construct. A human peripheral lymphocyte cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain in pACT at the XhoI site was co-transformed with the pAS1-CYH2-CCG1-HCR plasmid into Y190 yeast cells in which the His3 and β-galactosidase genes are integrated under the GAL4 element as the reporter. The yeast transformants were selected on minimal medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. The resultant colonies were tested for β-galactosidase activity to detect the specific interactions. The β-galactosidase assay was performed as described previously (39Bando M. Ijuin S. Hasegawa S. Horikoshi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Direct Interaction between CIB and CCG1 Proteins—The CIB and CCG1 (447-788 or 777-1111 aa) proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. The full-length CIB protein or buffer was immobilized with CNBr-activated Sepharose and used in the pull-down assay. Thus, 0.2 μg of CCG1 (447-788 or 777-1111 aa) protein was mixed with either 1 μg of CIB protein that had been immobilized with Sepharose or with Sepharose alone in the binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm ZnCl2) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. This was followed by three washes with the binding buffer. The pellet was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-His tag antibody.Genomic Southern Blot Hybridization—Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 65 °C in 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 2% SDS, 10× Denhardt’s solution, followed by three washes for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and two washes for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. Autoradiography was performed for 48 h at -80 °C. Human genomic DNA (Clontech, Inc.) was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, or PstI. The digested DNA was then subjected to 0.7% agarose electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and fixed with ultraviolet light. The DNA probe used was the same as that used in the Northern blot hybridization assay.Detection of CIB mRNA Transcripts in Human Tissues—A multiple human tissue mRNA blot (Clontech, Inc.) was hybridized with DNA probes that had been radiolabeled by [32P]dCTP using a random priming kit (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA probe was generated by XhoI digestion of CIB cDNA. Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 2% SDS, 10× Denhardt’s solution, followed by three washes for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and two washes for 20 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Autoradiography was performed for 48 h at -80 °C.Cellular Localization of CIB—CIB was cloned in-frame with green fluorescent protein in pEGFP. pEGFP-CIB was transfected into COS cells by Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate and ultraviolet filters.Transcriptional Activation Assay—CIB (70-210 aa) was cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in pAS1-CYH2 using NdeI and XhoI sites to make the pAS1-CYH2-CIB construct. pAS1-CYH2-CIB was transformed in Y190 yeast cells in which the β-galactosidase gene is integrated under the GAL4 element as the reporter. The transformants were tested by the β-galactosidase assay to detect transcriptional activation activity.Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Human CIB—The expression, purification, and crystallization of human CIB have been described elsewhere (40Padmanabhan B.

The structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement method at 2.8-Å resolution and refined to 2.2 Å with data from a native crystal (Table I). The native data were indexed and reduced with DENZO, and intensities were scaled using SCALEPACK (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 27: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38349) Google Scholar). The derivative data were indexed and processed with DPS (43Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1631-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Two uranium sites and one gold site were found and refined using SOLVE (44Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The experimental map produced by SOLVE was improved by solvent flattening with SOLOMON incorporated in CCP4 (45Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19702) Google Scholar). After solvent flattening, the map was reasonably good enough to trace the secondary structure elements using O (46Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kijeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar). The map was further improved by combining experimental phases with calculated phases obtained from the initial fitting. After the first refinement round, the R-factor was 29.4%, and Rfree was 34.3%. The model was refined with CNS (47Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Phase-combined σA-weighted electron density maps were used throughout to guide further model building and to place water molecules. The current refined model at a 2.2-Å resolution consists of 208 aa, one sulfate molecule, and 191 water molecules with a final R-factor of 18.9% and an Rfree of 23.5%. The electron densities for one residue at each of the amino and carboxyl termini were absent. PROCHECK (48Lakowski R. Macarther M.W. Moss P.S. Thronton J.M. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Hydrolase Assay—p-Nitrophenyl butyrate was used as the substrate for the hydrolase reaction. Thus, 6.25-50 ng of CIB wild type and 0.5 mmp-nitrophenyl butyrate were mixed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 20 °C for 10 min. At the end of the reaction, the optical density at 400 nm was measured to detect p-nitrophenol, the product of the hydrolysis reaction.Coordinates—Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1IMJ).RESULTSInteraction of CIB with the CCG1-HAT Domain and Transcriptional Activation Activity of CIB—We used a yeast two-hybrid system employing the HAT domain of CCG1 as bait to screen for proteins that interact with human CCG1 and identified two novel proteins named CIA (33Munakata T.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1479-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 41Padmanabhan B. Kuzuhara T. Horikoshi M. J. Cryst. Growth. 2001; 232: 326-329Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To confirm that CIB interacts specifically and directly with CCG1-HAT, we performed two-hybrid and pull-down assays. The two-hybrid assay shows that CIB does interact specifically with CCG1-HAT (Fig. 1A), whereas the pull-down assay (Fig. 1B) indicates that CIB protein binds directly and specifically to the 777-1111-aa domain of CCG1 but not to the 447-788-aa domain. To confirm that the CIB protein is encoded in the human genome, we performed genomic Southern blot hybridization using CIB cDNA as a probe. This indicated that CIB is indeed a human factor (Fig. 2A). Northern blot hybridization analysis also shows that CIB mRNA is expressed in almost all human tissues (Fig. 2B), which indicates that CIB is ubiquitously expressed. The CIB protein is found both in the nucleus and the cytosol (Fig. 3A), which suggests that it is involved in both nuclear and cytosolic reactions. As CIB interacts with the CCG1-HAT domain of the TFIID subunit, it is likely that CIB is involved in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, Fig. 3B indicates that CIB has transcriptional activation activity. All these results indicate that the CIB protein is indeed a general factor in humans that interacts with CCG1-HAT.Fig. 2CIB is encoded in the human genome and is a ubiquitously expressed factor.A, Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA shows it encodes CIB. Each lane contains 5 μg of digested human genomic DNA. The restriction enzymes used for the analysis are shown at the top. The sizes (in kb) of the molecular markers are indicated on the left.

The structure of CIB protein was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 18.9% at 2.2-Å resolution (Figs. 4 and 5 and Table I). The tertiary structure has an α/β-fold (Fig. 6). The β-sheet consists of seven parallel β-strands (β1, β3, β4, β5, β6, β7, and β8) and one antiparallel amino-terminal β-strand (β2), and it is flanked by helices α1 and α6 on one side and by helices α2, α3, α4, and α5 on the other side. The β-strands form a twisted β-sheet. A long loop comprising 69-90 aa connects β-strand β4 and helix α2. The outer two strands, β1 and β8, are oriented nearly perpendicular to each other, which results in a left-handed superhelical twist in the β-sheet. The first two strands, β1 and β2, run antiparallel to each other and are connected by a hairpin turn. The remaining β-strands in the β-sheet run parallel to strand β1.Fig. 4Stereo view of the refined (2Fo - Fc) electron density map of CIB at 2.2-Å resolution.

Moreover, although ubiquitous, the function of SYBL1 is prominent in specific tissues, such as brain. As a first insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling SYBL1 expression, in this report we describe the extent and role of SYBL1 upstream regions and characterize the binding of trans-acting factors. In vivo foot-printing experiments identify three protected regions. Band shift and transient reporter gene assays indicate a strong role of two of these evolutionary conserved regions in regulating SYBL1 transcription. Because one site is the classical CAAT box, we characterized the binding to the other site of the mammalian homologues of the selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor (Staf) family, zinc-finger transcription factors, and their role in regulating SYBL1 expression. The results reported here clarify that a Staf-zinc finger family factor, together with the CAAT factor, is the major nuclear protein bound to the SYBL1 promoter region and is responsible for its regulation in HeLa cells, thus identifying the basic control of SYBL1 transcription. In vivo binding of Staf proteins to the SYBL1 promoter is confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Our results identify a fourth mRNA promoter stimulated by a member of the Staf-zinc finger family, the function of which on mRNA polymerase II promoters is still very poorly understood.

This regulation is achieved by epigenetic mechanisms, such as methylation (3Huber R. Hansen R.S. Strazzullo M. Pengue G. Mazzarella R. D'Urso M. Schlessinger D. Pilia G. Gartler S.M. D'Esposito M.

An additional level of regulation of this gene could derive from its cellular functions: the SYBL1 protein is also called Ti-VAMP (tetanus-insensitive VAMP) because it is the only v-SNARE insensitive to tetanus and botulinum toxin cleavage (6Schiavo G.

Hence, Ti-VAMP is crucial for all cellular transports whose occurrence is not affected by these toxins, such as neurite outgrowth (8Martinez-Arca S. Alberts P. Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J.

The tissue-restricted function of an otherwise housekeeping molecule may be dependent upon a plethora of mechanisms, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or translational. As a first insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling SYBL1 expression and consequently its function, we describe here the extent and role of SYBL1 upstream regions and characterize the binding of trans-acting factors possibly regulating SYBL1 gene expression. To investigate the regions of the SYBL1 promoter capable of trans-acting factor binding, we performed in vivo footprinting experiments. Three sites were protected; by using bioinformatics analysis we identified two as regions that play an important role in determining the promoter activity of the gene containing, respectively, CAAT and Staf-ZNF motifs. Staf (selenocysteine tRNA gene transcription activating factor) was identified as a transcription factor that binds to the tRNA (Sec) activator element mediating its activation properties. Staf can also stimulate transcription from an mRNA-type pol II promoter (10Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To date, only three mRNA pol II promoters, with transcription regulated by Staf, have been identified (12Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4846-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ZNF76 and ZNF143 are basically considered to play the same role as Staf, even though the expression levels in various tissues differ between the two homologues. ZNF143 is considered to be the ortholog of Staf, whereas ZNF76 is a DNA-binding protein related to Staf and ZNF143 (18Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To assess their relative importance in SYBL1 promoter function, we mutated each of the three sites identified, to disrupt each element separately and yet together in the same promoter. The mutation of the Staf-ZNF motif results in a decrease in promoter activity. On the other hand, co-transfection of the SYBL1 promoter and Staf-ZNF-expressing plasmids in Drosophila Schneider (SL2) cells reveals that Staf-ZNF increases promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that endogenous Staf/ZNF is constitutively bound to the endogenous SYBL1 promoter. Our results suggest that Staf-ZNF is a nuclear protein bound to the regulatory region of the SYBL1 promoter and, together with the CAAT factor, can regulate basal promoter activity. These data will provide the platform for understanding the transcriptional control of this peculiar gene. DMS in Vivo Footprinting—HeLa cells (107) grown in 15-cm dishes were incubated with DMS (dimethylsulfate) (1 μl/ml; Sigma) for 5 min. DNA extraction, cleavage with piperidine, and linker-mediated PCR reaction were performed as described (28Mueller P.R. Wold B. Garrity P.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and John Wiley and Sons, New York1992: 15.5.1-15.5.27Google Scholar). The primers used (a1, a2, a3 for the upper strand and b1, b2, b3 for the lower strand) are shown in Fig. 1. DNA-protein interactions were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. As a control, phenol-extracted chromosomal DNA was treated with DMS in vitro and analyzed in parallel. Reporter and Effector Constructs—The reporter gene wtSYBL1 was generated by subcloning the –217/+37 fragment obtained by PCR amplification of the human SYBL1 gene 5′-flanking region into XhoI-HindIII-digested pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) containing the firefly luciferase gene. The 5′ and 3′ external vector-targeted primers used (Fw-out, 5′-GGCATCTCGAGGACGCTGTTTACCAC-3′, or Rs-out, 5′-GGACTAAGCTTCAGGGTCGCCAACTG-3′), incorporated a XhoI and a HindIII site, respectively. Nucleotide substitutions were introduced into the wtSYBL1 (–217/+37) construct by site-directed mutagenesis to obtain single, double, and triple mutants (Fig. 3). Briefly, as a first step, PCRs were carried out using an internal mutagenic primer and one of the external vector-targeted primers (Fw-out or Rs-out). In each mutated site, six nucleotides were substituted with an EcoR1 site (Figs. 1 and 3). The PCR products from each set of first-step PCRs were purified, mixed, and used in the second-step PCR with the external vector-targeted primers. The products from the second-step PCRs were digested with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into a pGL3-basic vector. To construct the double mutants CAAT/Staf-ZNF and SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNF, the –217/+37 SYBL1 fragment was excised from the respective mutated constructs and digested with RsaI. The fragments containing the desired mutations were linked together and with the pGL3-basic vector. For the double mutant CAAT/SYBL1-X the excised fragment from mutant SYBL1-X was digested with TseI, whereas the excised fragment from mutant CAAT was digested with TseI and DdeI. These fragments were ligated together and with pGL3-basic vector. To obtain the triple mutant we digested the mutants SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNF with TseI and the mutant CAAT with TseI and DdeI. The fragments of interest obtained were ligated together and with the pGL3-basic vector. All of the constructs were sequenced using a DNA sequencer (ABI Prism 3100) to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. The Drosophila expression vectors pPac-ZNF143, pPac-ZNF76, and pPac-Staf have already been described (18Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P.

Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1841-1848PubMed Google Scholar), containing only the Drosophila actin promoter, was generously provided by Dr. P. De Luca. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin at usual concentrations). For transfection experiments the cells were grown in a 6-well plate at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Either 1.0 μg of pGL3-promoter plasmid or an equivalent molar amount of test plasmid was co-transfected into HeLa along with 0.030 μg of pRL-CMV plasmid using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The pRL-CMV vector containing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (Promega) was used as an internal control for differences in transfection efficiency. To ascertain the functional analysis of the promoter region of the SYBL1 gene, the transfected cells were maintained for 48 h in serum-supplemented medium before harvesting. At the end of the culture period, the transfectants were lysed and the luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured by a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). SL2 were grown at 25 °C in Schneider's medium. When effector constructs were employed, 1.4 × 106 cells were co-transfected with 1.0 μg of the reporter, 0.5 μg of the effector, and 0.020 μg of the internal control. To maintain the ratio between the FuGENE reagent and the amount of transfected DNA as recommended by the manufacturer, 2.0 or 1.5 μg of the inert vector pPac0 were co-transfected in Schneider's cell. Each transfection experiment was undertaken in triplicate, with at least two different plasmid preparations. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from untransfected HeLa cells and from transiently transfected SL2 cells by hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei as described by Lee et al. (22Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel shifts were performed using standard methods (23Kagoshima H. Akamatsu Y. Ito Y. Shigesada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33074-33082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (Staf-ZNFwt 5′-actactactcccagaatgcagtacggct-3′ and Staf-ZNFmut 5′-actactagaattcgaatgcagtacgcct-3′), end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, were incubated with nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature. To carry out supershift assays, antibodies were added to the binding assay mixtures and incubated for 2 h on ice before the radiolabeled probe was added. Rabbit anti-serum against ZNF143 (12Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. H. Kubota. IgG fraction was purified with this rabbit serum by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP procedure was performed as described previously (5Matarazzo M.R. De Bonis M.L. Gregory R.I. Vacca M. Hansen R.S. Mercadante G. D'Urso M. Feil R. D'Esposito M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3191-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, we incubated 3 × 106 HeLa cells/immunoprecipitate with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. Shearing of chromatin was performed to an average size of 200–1000 bp; after a spinning step to reduce debris, the soluble chromatin was diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitates of cross-linked complexes were prepared using 1.5 μg of anti-ZNF143 antibody. A “no antibody” sample (No Ab) was carried out as a control for nonspecific interactions. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the bound antibody-protein-DNA complexes (immunoprecipitates) were brought down with protein A-Sepharose beads. The supernatant fraction from the No-Ab sample was kept as the “total input chromatin.” After cross-linking reversal and proteinase K digestion, each individual immunoprecipitate was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and UV quantified. The following primers were used for gene-specific PCR on the SYBL1 promoter (Fig. 1) and on SYBL1 exon 3 (negative control): SYBL1 promoter, Syb14 GCGACACGGCTAGGCCTG and a2 TATGCCGCCTACTCATTGCTGGTAGA; Exon 3-specific primers, es3telF GTAGAATTCAGAAGTAAAAGTGATGTTG and es3telR GTCGGATCCAAGAACTGGCTGTATTAACA. Amplification was performed using Gold Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at thermocycler settings of 1 cycle at 95° × 10′ followed by 33 cycles of 95° × 30″, 62° × 30″, 72° × 30″ with a final extension of 72° × 5′. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 1.7% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide intercalation. In Vivo Footprinting Indicates Three Protected Sites in the SYBL1 Promoter Region—To identify regions of DNA-protein interactions in the SYBL1 promoter, we performed in vivo genomic footprinting in the region from –319 to +102, which includes the two conserved regions (human-mouse) CR1 and CR2 and the three previously identified start sites (24Matarazzo M.R. Cuccurese M. Strazzullo M. Vacca M. Curci A. Miano M.G. Cocchia M. Mercadante G. Torino A. D'Urso M. Ciccodicola A. D'Esposito M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Footprinting was carried out using DMS as a modifying agent, which methylates freely accessible guanosine residues of DNA in living cells unless they are protected by DNA-bound factors. In HeLa cells, three protected sites were detected (Fig. 2). The profiles in vivo compared with the control DNA (in vitro) indicate, in fact, a protection of residues around –67/–68, around –100/–103, and around –144/–146 with respect to the principal transcriptional start site (3Huber R. Hansen R.S. Strazzullo M. Pengue G. Mazzarella R. D'Urso M. Schlessinger D. Pilia G. Gartler S.M. D'Esposito M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A computer analysis (MatInspector 6.1; www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin/./eldorado/main.pl) to search for possible trans-acting factors recognizing these three regions indicated the possibility that the site around –67/–68 is a CAAT box binding site, whereas for the second site, around –100/–103 (SYBL1-X), no factors are presently indicated in trans-factor databases. For the third site, however, around –144/–146, the possible binding for a Staf-ZNF protein is also indicated. Analysis of SYBL1 Mutants in HeLa Cells—To assess the relative importance of the three transcription factor binding sites in the SYBL1 promoter function, mutations were introduced into each of the sites identified to disrupt each element separately in the same molecule (single, double, and triple mutants: see Fig. 3). Mutated constructs were then transfected into HeLa cells. Promoter activities were determined by quantification of luciferase reporter gene levels (Fig. 3). Disruption of the CAAT element resulted in a decrease of the activity to 67% of wt (Fig. 3, CAATmut), disruption of the SYBL1-X element resulted in a slight decrease of activity to 81% of wt (Fig. 3, SYBL1-Xmut), and disruption of the Staf-ZNF element resulted in a decrease of activity to 39% of wt (Fig. 3, Staf-ZNFmut), indicating that this site is of major importance in the SYBL1 promoter. With the double mutant CAAT/SYBL1-Xmut, the promoter activity was reduced almost to the same extent as the CAAT-mut (Fig. 3, CAATmut/SYBL1-Xmut). With the double mutant CAAT/Staf-ZNFmut, the promoter activity was reduced to 19% of wt (Fig. 3, CAAT/Staf-ZNFmut), and this activity is further reduced with the triple mutant to 8% of wt (Fig. 3, CAAT/SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNFmut). Surprisingly, in the double mutant SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNF, the activity is only slightly reduced to 71% of wt (Fig. 3, SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNFmut). Staf-ZNF Binds to the SYBL1 Gene Promoter—To establish whether endogenous proteins from HeLa cells are able to bind to the Staf-ZNF site in the SYBL1 promoter, nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence of a labeled probe containing the Staf-ZNF sequence (Fig. 4). A specific retarded protein-DNA complex was observed (Fig. 4, lane 2). This complex was abrogated with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lane 3), establishing binding specificity. No competition of the specific complex was observed using an unlabeled oligonucleotide with mutation of the consensus Staf-ZNF binding sequence (data not shown). When this mutated oligonucleotide was used in gel mobility shift assays as labeled probe, complex formation was completely abolished (Fig. 4, lane 6). When protein-DNA complex was incubated with antibodies against ZNF143, a supershift was observed, suggesting that ZNF143 binds to the SYBL1 promoter in vitro in the Staf-ZNF region (Fig. 4, lane 4). ChIP (25Orlando V. Strutt H. Paro R. Methods. 1997; 11: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) was performed to demonstrate the in vivo binding of ZNF143 to the SYBL1 promoter in HeLa cells. This high-resolution technique is a powerful method successfully employed to verify the in vivo protein-DNA interactions of DNA-binding proteins (26Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 27Fournier C. Goto Y. Ballestar E. Delaval K. Hever A.M. Esteller M. Feil R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate the ZNF143-DNA consensus site complexes, we used the same antibody described above (see Fig. 4). ZNF143 antibody enriched the SYBL1 promoter sequences relative to the no antibody control sample, indicating the specific binding of ZNF143 on its consensus sequence of this promoter (Fig. 5). As a negative control, a region in the body of the SYBL1 gene, which does not contain any binding site, was analyzed. As expected, this region was not enriched by the antibody to ZNF143. Activation of the SYBL1 Promoter in Drosophila Schneider Cells—To further confirm a role for Staf-ZNF in the SYBL1 promoter in vivo and determine whether members of the Staf-ZNF family of transcription factors functionally interact with the promoter of SYBL1, transient transfection experiments were performed with SL2 cells, which lack many mammalian transcription factors such as ZNF143 and ZNF76 (18Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21998-22006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Schuster C. Myslinski E. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3777-3787Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression constructs under the control of an SL2-specific promoter for ZNF143 (pPac-ZNF143), ZNF76 (pPac-ZNF76), Staf (pPac-Staf), and empty pPac0 were co-transfected along with reporter vectors (pGL3) under the control of different SYBL1 promoters, the wild type promoter (Fig. 6, wtSYBL1), and the Staf-ZNFmut construct (Fig. 6, Staf-ZNFmut). Normalized luciferase activities for the pGL3 reporter constructs were compared with those obtained with the empty SL2 expression vector pPac0. Co-transfection of SYBL1wt with the expressing vectors pPac-Staf, pPacZNF76, or pPacZNF143 induced a notable increase (54,1%; 51,5%; and 101,2%, respectively) in relative luciferase activity over co-transfection with pPac0 (Fig. 6, wtSYBL1). In contrast, highly reduced values were observed after co-transfection of SL2 cells with Staf-ZNFmut and the expression constructs pPac-Staf, pPacZNF143, and pPac-ZNF76 (5,5%; 11,8%; and 10,6%, respectively) (Fig. 6, Staf-ZNFmut). These experiments demonstrated that Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143 can specifically mediate the transcriptional activation of wild type SYBL1 promoter in Drosophila SL2 cells. Mobility Shift Assay in SL2 Cells—Expression in SL2 cells after transient transfection with the different pPac expression plasmids (pPac-Staf, pPacZNF76, or pPacZNF143) was confirmed using EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) (Fig. 7). In fact, the binding of expressed Staf, ZNF76, and ZNF143 proteins with the consensus oligonucleotides for Staf-ZNF was seen in gel shift assays using nuclear extracts from SL2 cells transiently transfected with the different expression plasmids (Fig. 7, lanes 2, 4, 6). No binding was observed with untransfected SL2 cells (Fig. 7, lane 1). Only a light supershift was observed in incubating protein-DNA complexes obtained from Drosophila extracts after co-transfection with ZNF143 with an antibody against ZNF143 (Fig. 7, lane 8), as already observed in HeLa cells. To provide insight into the regulation of the human SYBL1 gene and better clarify its role in cellular mechanisms, we have characterized cis- and trans-acting elements regulating the basal transcription of the human SYBL1 promoter. By in vivo footprinting we have identified three cis-acting elements, a Staf-ZNF site, a canonical CAAT box, and a third unknown binding site that we named SYBL1-X (Figs. 1 and 2) because at the moment the data present in the international transcription factor databases do not suggest which element can bind to this site. Transfection experiments in the human cell line HeLa (Fig. 3), using mutant constructs, have shown that the first two sites (Staf-ZNF and CAAT) have a fundamental role in directing high level expression of the human SYBL1 gene promoter, whereas the third element (SYBL1-X) does not seem to have a relevant role in driving SYBL1 gene promoter expression, at least in HeLa cells. In fact, though SYBL1 is a ubiquitous gene, it has specific cellular functions, and it cannot be excluded that the SYBL1-X factors may need a tissue-specific co-factor, not present in HeLa cells, to function in a more efficient manner. To test which factors are important for the tissue-specific regulation of the SYBL1 gene it should be useful to undertake experiments in other cellular lines and in inducible systems where the role of the SYBL1 protein has already been shown to be important, such as PC12-treated cells or differentiated colon carcinoma cells (7Galli T. Zahraoui A. Vaidyanathan V.V. Raposo G. Tian J.M. Karin M. Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 6: 1437-1448Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 8Martinez-Arca S. Alberts P. Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the two more important cis-acting elements are both present in their entirety in the two previously identified strictly human-mouse conserved regions, CR1 and CR2 (24Matarazzo M.R. Cuccurese M. Strazzullo M. Vacca M. Curci A. Miano M.G. Cocchia M. Mercadante G. Torino A. D'Urso M. Ciccodicola A. D'Esposito M. Gene. 1999; 240: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which argues for an important, biologically conserved function of these transcriptional control elements (Fig. 1). Single mutant constructs indicate a principal role for the Staf-ZNF site (Fig. 3, Staf-ZNFmut) and for the CAAT site (Fig. 3, CAAT-mut); mutation of the SYBL1-X site had little effect on the activity of the promoter (Fig. 3, SYBL1-Xmut). The level of activity obtained with the double mutant construct CAAT/SYBL1-Xmut (Fig. 3, CAAT/SYBL1-Xmut) confirms the role of both CAAT and SYBL1-X sites and indicates that Staf alone can efficiently drive the promoter activity. When both Staf-ZNF and CAAT sites were mutated, the level of promoter activity was strongly reduced (Fig. 3, CAAT/Staf-ZNFmut), indicating that these two sites together have a fundamental importance for SYBL1 gene promoter activity. This result is further confirmed when using the triple mutants CAAT/SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNFmut (Fig. 3). The level of promoter activity obtained by the construct SYBL1-X/Staf-ZNFmut (Fig. 3) is surprisingly higher than that obtained with the single mutant Staf-ZNFmut. This result could be explained by considering that the low activity obtained with the construct Staf-ZNFmut is not only due to the absence of the important factor Staf-ZNF but also to an inhibitory effect such as steric hindrance by the factor SYBL1-X on the CAAT factor. In the absence of the Staf-ZNF factor, the SYBL1-X factor may reduce the capacity of the CAAT factor to function. EMSA experiments, using HeLa nuclear extracts, identified a protein-DNA complex, indicating that endogenous proteins from HeLa cells are able to bind to the Staf-ZNF site in the SYBL1 promoter. Supershift analysis indicated ZNF143 as the factor bound to the Staf-ZNF element of the SYBL1 promoter gene (Fig. 4, lane 4). In this case, the intensity of the specific protein-DNA complex is higher than that obtained without the use of the antibody (Fig. 4, lane 2), indicating that the antibody can stabilize the DNA-protein interaction. The slightness of the supershift band obtained can be due to low efficiency of the antibodies. In fact, the same faint supershift band (Fig. 7, lane 8) is also obtained in EMSA experiments with transfected Drosophila SL2 extracts, where there are no other proteins that can bind to the Staf-ZNF site. Here, the retarded complexes obtained (Fig. 7, lanes 2, 4, 6) can only be because of Staf-ZNF factors. In fact, when using nuclear extracts from SL2 cells not transfected with the effector constructs (pPacStaf, pPacZNF143, or pPacZNF76), no any protein-DNA complex is observed (Fig. 7, lane 1). In vivo evidence of specific recruitment of ZNF143 to the Staf/ZNF site is provided in the chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5). This technique is able to overcome the limitations present in other methods by taking a picture or freezing the DNA-protein interaction in situ through fixation with formaldehyde. This method has been largely used to identify binding sites for transcription factors and characterize their in vivo interaction with target DNA (26Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) as well as to analyze regulatory proteins associated with chromatin (27Fournier C. Goto Y. Ballestar E. Delaval K. Hever A.M. Esteller M. Feil R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6560-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The co-transfection of Staf, ZNF76, or ZNF143 in Drosophila SL2 cell lines, which are deprived of any Staf-ZNF transcription factors, resulted in a strong induction of the human SYBL1 promoter (Fig. 6, wtSYBL1), otherwise completely inactive in these cells (data not shown). In particular, the mammalian homologue of Staf, ZNF143 (15Ragoussis J. Senger G. Mockridge I. Sanseau P. Ruddy S. Dudley K. Sheer D. Trowsdale J. Genomics. 1992; 14: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Tommerup N. Vissing H. Genomics. 1995; 27: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), appears to be the major trans-acting factor up-regulating SYBL1 transcription through the Staf-ZNF element. Co-transfection of Staf, ZNF76, or ZNF143 with the Staf-ZNF mutant results instead in a very low level of induction (Fig. 6, Staf-ZNFmut), confirming the importance of the Staf-ZNF element in the SYBL1 gene promoter. Overall, we have demonstrated that Staf-ZNF family transcription factors, first characterized for their role as snRNA gene promoters, are very important stimulatory factors for the human SYBL1 gene promoter in HeLa cells. Our results are consistent with the previous finding that Staf-ZNF can stimulate not only transcription by RNA polymerase III but also transcription by RNA polymerase II (10Schaub M. Myslinski E. Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Schuster C. Krol A. Carbon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2650-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To date, only three mRNA pol II promoters whose transcription is regulated by Staf have been identified: the mouse cytosolic chaperonin containing t-complex polypeptide 1α subunit (Ccta) gene (12Kubota H. Yokota S. Yanagi H. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28641-28648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the human interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) gene (13Mach C.M. Hargrove B.W. Kunkel G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4853-4858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and the human neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene (14Saur D. Seidler B. Paehge H. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25798-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). At present, very little is known about the role of Staf-ZNF transcription factor family members in the trans-activation of mRNA promoters and, given the limited dataset of mRNA promoters containing STAF-ZNF elements, it is very difficult to establish whether a correlation exists between other features of these promoters. The present study extends the role of Staf-ZNF-binding proteins to the transcription of a fourth mRNA promoter. Moreover, this is the first time that the role for Staf-ZNF family factors on a TATA-less promoter containing a CAAT box has been demonstrated. Further studies are needed to obtain more details concerning SYBL1 transcriptional regulation and, in particular, its tissue-restricted expression. We thank Dr. P.
