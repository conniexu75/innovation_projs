https://openalex.org/W2910313823,"Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising fluid biomarker of disease progression for various cerebral proteopathies. Here we leverage the unique characteristics of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and ultrasensitive immunoassay technology to demonstrate that NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (n = 187) and serum (n = 405) are correlated with one another and are elevated at the presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer’s disease. Longitudinal, within-person analysis of serum NfL dynamics (n = 196) confirmed this elevation and further revealed that the rate of change of serum NfL could discriminate mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers almost a decade earlier than cross-sectional absolute NfL levels (that is, 16.2 versus 6.8 years before the estimated symptom onset). Serum NfL rate of change peaked in participants converting from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and was associated with cortical thinning assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, but less so with amyloid-β deposition or glucose metabolism (assessed by positron emission tomography). Serum NfL was predictive for both the rate of cortical thinning and cognitive changes assessed by the Mini–Mental State Examination and Logical Memory test. Thus, NfL dynamics in serum predict disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the early presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer’s disease, which supports its potential utility as a clinically useful biomarker."

https://openalex.org/W2910384850,"In principle, humans can produce an antibody response to any non-self-antigen molecule in the appropriate context. This flexibility is achieved by the presence of a large repertoire of naive antibodies, the diversity of which is expanded by somatic hypermutation following antigen exposure1. The diversity of the naive antibody repertoire in humans is estimated to be at least 1012 unique antibodies2. Because the number of peripheral blood B cells in a healthy adult human is on the order of 5 × 109, the circulating B cell population samples only a small fraction of this diversity. Full-scale analyses of human antibody repertoires have been prohibitively difficult, primarily owing to their massive size. The amount of information encoded by all of the rearranged antibody and T cell receptor genes in one person-the 'genome' of the adaptive immune system-exceeds the size of the human genome by more than four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because much of the B lymphocyte population is localized in organs or tissues that cannot be comprehensively sampled from living subjects, human repertoire studies have focused on circulating B cells3. Here we examine the circulating B cell populations of ten human subjects and present what is, to our knowledge, the largest single collection of adaptive immune receptor sequences described to date, comprising almost 3 billion antibody heavy-chain sequences. This dataset enables genetic study of the baseline human antibody repertoire at an unprecedented depth and granularity, which reveals largely unique repertoires for each individual studied, a subpopulation of universally shared antibody clonotypes, and an exceptional overall diversity of the antibody repertoire."

https://openalex.org/W2908721251,"In order to provide a comprehensive resource for human structural variants (SVs), we generated long-read sequence data and analyzed SVs for fifteen human genomes. We sequence resolved 99,604 insertions, deletions, and inversions including 2,238 (1.6 Mbp) that are shared among all discovery genomes with an additional 13,053 (6.9 Mbp) present in the majority, indicating minor alleles or errors in the reference. Genotyping in 440 additional genomes confirms the most common SVs in unique euchromatin are now sequence resolved. We report a ninefold SV bias toward the last 5 Mbp of human chromosomes with nearly 55% of all VNTRs (variable number of tandem repeats) mapping to this portion of the genome. We identify SVs affecting coding and noncoding regulatory loci improving annotation and interpretation of functional variation. These data provide the framework to construct a canonical human reference and a resource for developing advanced representations capable of capturing allelic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2950103694,"Osteoarthritis is the most common musculoskeletal disease and the leading cause of disability globally. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study for osteoarthritis (77,052 cases and 378,169 controls), analyzing four phenotypes: knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, knee and/or hip osteoarthritis, and any osteoarthritis. We discovered 64 signals, 52 of them novel, more than doubling the number of established disease loci. Six signals fine-mapped to a single variant. We identified putative effector genes by integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization, fine-mapping, and human rare-disease, animal-model, and osteoarthritis tissue expression data. We found enrichment for genes underlying monogenic forms of bone development diseases, and for the collagen formation and extracellular matrix organization biological pathways. Ten of the likely effector genes, including TGFB1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), FGF18 (fibroblast growth factor 18), CTSK (cathepsin K), and IL11 (interleukin 11), have therapeutics approved or in clinical trials, with mechanisms of action supportive of evaluation for efficacy in osteoarthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2908812320,"The presence of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in bone marrow is predictive of poor metastasis-free survival of patients with breast cancer with localized disease. DTCs persist in distant tissues despite systemic administration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Many assume that this is because the majority of DTCs are quiescent. Here, we challenge this notion and provide evidence that the microenvironment of DTCs protects them from chemotherapy, independent of cell cycle status. We show that chemoresistant DTCs occupy the perivascular niche (PVN) of distant tissues, where they are protected from therapy by vascular endothelium. Inhibiting integrin-mediated interactions between DTCs and the PVN, driven partly by endothelial-derived von Willebrand factor and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, sensitizes DTCs to chemotherapy. Importantly, chemosensitization is achieved without inducing DTC proliferation or exacerbating chemotherapy-associated toxicities, and ultimately results in prevention of bone metastasis. This suggests that prefacing adjuvant therapy with integrin inhibitors is a viable clinical strategy to eradicate DTCs and prevent metastasis. Carlson et al. show that DTCs within the PVN are protected from chemotherapy; targeting interactions between DTCs and the PVN enhances chemosensitivity and prevents bone metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2910248442,"The molecular alterations that occur in cells before cancer is manifest are largely uncharted. Lung carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions are the pre-invasive precursor to squamous cell carcinoma. Although microscopically identical, their future is in equipoise, with half progressing to invasive cancer and half regressing or remaining static. The cellular basis of this clinical observation is unknown. Here, we profile the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic landscape of CIS in a unique patient cohort with longitudinally monitored pre-invasive disease. Predictive modeling identifies which lesions will progress with remarkable accuracy. We identify progression-specific methylation changes on a background of widespread heterogeneity, alongside a strong chromosomal instability signature. We observed mutations and copy number changes characteristic of cancer and chart their emergence, offering a window into early carcinogenesis. We anticipate that this new understanding of cancer precursor biology will improve early detection, reduce overtreatment, and foster preventative therapies targeting early clonal events in lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2910213537,"Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are non-membrane-bound organelles that have critical roles in the stress response1,2, maternal messenger RNA storage3, synaptic plasticity4, tumour progression5,6 and neurodegeneration7-9. However, the dynamics of their mRNA components within and near the granule surface remain poorly characterized, particularly in the context and timing of mRNAs exiting translation. Herein, we used multicolour single-molecule tracking to quantify the precise timing and kinetics of single mRNAs as they exit translation and enter RNP granules during stress. We observed single mRNAs interacting with stress granules and P-bodies, with mRNAs moving bidirectionally between them. Although translating mRNAs only interact with RNP granules dynamically, non-translating mRNAs can form stable, and sometimes rigid, associations with RNP granules with stability increasing with both mRNA length and granule size. Live and fixed cell imaging demonstrated that mRNAs can extend beyond the protein surface of a stress granule, which may facilitate interactions between RNP granules. Thus, the recruitment of mRNPs to RNP granules involves dynamic, stable and extended interactions affected by translation status, mRNA length and granule size that collectively regulate RNP granule dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2908629632,"The clearance of damaged myelin sheaths is critical to ensure functional recovery from neural injury. Here we show a previously unidentified role for microvessels and their lining endothelial cells in engulfing myelin debris in spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We demonstrate that IgG opsonization of myelin debris is required for its effective engulfment by endothelial cells and that the autophagy-lysosome pathway is crucial for degradation of engulfed myelin debris. We further show that endothelial cells exert critical functions beyond myelin clearance to promote progression of demyelination disorders by regulating macrophage infiltration, pathologic angiogenesis and fibrosis in both SCI and EAE. Unexpectedly, myelin debris engulfment induces endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process that confers upon endothelial cells the ability to stimulate the endothelial-derived production of fibrotic components. Overall, our study demonstrates that the processing of myelin debris through the autophagy-lysosome pathway promotes inflammation and angiogenesis and may contribute to fibrotic scar formation."
https://openalex.org/W2909946034,"The ability to generate T cells from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) has the potential to transform autologous T cell immunotherapy by facilitating universal, off-the-shelf cell products. However, differentiation of human PSCs into mature, conventional T cells has been challenging with existing methods. We report that a continuous 3D organoid system induced an orderly sequence of commitment and differentiation from PSC-derived embryonic mesoderm through hematopoietic specification and efficient terminal differentiation to naive CD3+CD8αβ+ and CD3+CD4+ conventional T cells with a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Introduction of an MHC class I-restricted TCR in PSCs produced naive, antigen-specific CD8αβ+ T cells that lacked endogenous TCR expression and showed anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Functional assays and RNA sequencing aligned PSC-derived T cells with primary naive CD8+ T cells. The PSC-artificial thymic organoid (ATO) system presented here is an efficient platform for generating functional, mature T cells from human PSCs."

https://openalex.org/W2909490028,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained in a perivascular niche in bone marrow, in which leptin receptor+ (LepR) stromal cells and endothelial cells synthesize factors required for HSC maintenance, including stem cell factor (SCF). An important question is why LepR+ cells are one hundred times more frequent than HSCs. Here, we show that SCF from LepR+ cells is also necessary to maintain many c-kit+-restricted hematopoietic progenitors. Conditional deletion of Scf from LepR+ cells depleted common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs), pre-megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (PreMegEs), and colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-Es), as well as myeloid and erythroid blood cells. This was not caused by HSC depletion, as many other restricted progenitors were unaffected. Moreover, Scf deletion from endothelial cells depleted HSCs, but not progenitors. Early erythroid progenitors were closely associated with perisinusoidal LepR+ cells. This reveals cellular specialization within the niche: SCF from LepR+ cells is broadly required by HSCs and restricted progenitors while SCF from endothelial cells is required mainly by HSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2909188408,"Chordoma is a primary bone cancer with no approved therapy1. The identification of therapeutic targets in this disease has been challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of clinically actionable somatic mutations in chordoma tumors2,3. Here we describe the discovery of therapeutically targetable chordoma dependencies via genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening and focused small-molecule sensitivity profiling. These systematic approaches reveal that the developmental transcription factor T (brachyury; TBXT) is the top selectively essential gene in chordoma, and that transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors targeting CDK7/12/13 and CDK9 potently suppress chordoma cell proliferation. In other cancer types, transcriptional CDK inhibitors have been observed to downregulate highly expressed, enhancer-associated oncogenic transcription factors4,5. In chordoma, we find that T is associated with a 1.5-Mb region containing ‘super-enhancers’ and is the most highly expressed super-enhancer-associated transcription factor. Notably, transcriptional CDK inhibition leads to preferential and concentration-dependent downregulation of cellular brachyury protein levels in all models tested. In vivo, CDK7/12/13-inhibitor treatment substantially reduces tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate small-molecule targeting of brachyury transcription factor addiction in chordoma, identify a mechanism of T gene regulation that underlies this therapeutic strategy, and provide a blueprint for applying systematic genetic and chemical screening approaches to discover vulnerabilities in genomically quiet cancers. A combination of genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening and focused small-molecule sensitivity profiling enables the discovery of therapeutically targetable tumor dependencies in rare tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2952395051,"Sequential and persistent activity models are two prominent models of short-term memory in neural circuits. In persistent activity models, memories are represented in persistent or nearly persistent activity patterns across a population of neurons, whereas in sequential models, memories are represented dynamically by a sequential activity pattern across the population. Experimental evidence for both models has been reported previously. However, it has been unclear under what conditions these two qualitatively different types of solutions emerge in neural circuits. Here, we address this question by training recurrent neural networks on several short-term memory tasks under a wide range of circuit and task manipulations. We show that both sequential and nearly persistent solutions are part of a spectrum that emerges naturally in trained networks under different conditions. Our results help to clarify some seemingly contradictory experimental results on the existence of sequential versus persistent activity-based short-term memory mechanisms in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2910248657,"The pancreatic islets of Langerhans regulate glucose homeostasis. The loss of insulin-producing β cells within islets results in diabetes, and islet transplantation from cadaveric donors can cure the disease. In vitro production of whole islets, not just β cells, will benefit from a better understanding of endocrine differentiation and islet morphogenesis. We used single-cell mRNA sequencing to obtain a detailed description of pancreatic islet development. Contrary to the prevailing dogma, we find islet morphology and endocrine differentiation to be directly related. As endocrine progenitors differentiate, they migrate in cohesion and form bud-like islet precursors, or “peninsulas” (literally “almost islands”). α cells, the first to develop, constitute the peninsular outer layer, and β cells form later, beneath them. This spatiotemporal collinearity leads to the typical core-mantle architecture of the mature, spherical islet. Finally, we induce peninsula-like structures in differentiating human embryonic stem cells, laying the ground for the generation of entire islets in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2909430042,"We generated cortical interneurons (cINs) from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from 14 healthy controls and 14 subjects with schizophrenia. Both healthy control cINs and schizophrenia cINs were authentic, fired spontaneously, received functional excitatory inputs from host neurons, and induced GABA-mediated inhibition in host neurons in vivo. However, schizophrenia cINs had dysregulated expression of protocadherin genes, which lie within documented schizophrenia loci. Mice lacking protocadherin-α showed defective arborization and synaptic density of prefrontal cortex cINs and behavioral abnormalities. Schizophrenia cINs similarly showed defects in synaptic density and arborization that were reversed by inhibitors of protein kinase C, a downstream kinase in the protocadherin pathway. These findings reveal an intrinsic abnormality in schizophrenia cINs in the absence of any circuit-driven pathology. They also demonstrate the utility of homogenous and functional populations of a relevant neuronal subtype for probing pathogenesis mechanisms during development. Shao et al. report that interneurons derived from iPSCs from schizophrenia patients have altered protocadherin expression and synaptic and arborization deficits. A PKC inhibitor, acting downstream of protocadherin, reversed the arborization deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2911081636,"Hypothalamic melanocortin neurons play a pivotal role in weight regulation. Here, we examined the contribution of Semaphorin 3 (SEMA3) signaling to the development of these circuits. In genetic studies, we found 40 rare variants in SEMA3A-G and their receptors (PLXNA1-4; NRP1-2) in 573 severely obese individuals; variants disrupted secretion and/or signaling through multiple molecular mechanisms. Rare variants in this set of genes were significantly enriched in 982 severely obese cases compared to 4,449 controls. In a zebrafish mutagenesis screen, deletion of 7 genes in this pathway led to increased somatic growth and/or adiposity demonstrating that disruption of Semaphorin 3 signaling perturbs energy homeostasis. In mice, deletion of the Neuropilin-2 receptor in Pro-opiomelanocortin neurons disrupted their projections from the arcuate to the paraventricular nucleus, reduced energy expenditure, and caused weight gain. Cumulatively, these studies demonstrate that SEMA3-mediated signaling drives the development of hypothalamic melanocortin circuits involved in energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2911110133,"Neurons in hippocampal output area CA1 are thought to exhibit redundancy across cortical and hippocampal inputs. Here we show instead that acute silencing of CA3 terminals drastically reduces place field responses for many CA1 neurons, while a smaller number are unaffected or have increased responses. These results imply that CA3 is the predominant driver of CA1 place cells under normal conditions, while also revealing heterogeneity in input dominance across cells."

However, the efficacy of this therapeutic approach is far from optimal, based on the limited expansion of somatic stem cells in vitro and the rapid stress-induced decay of stem cells in vivo. Further, safety concerns regarding the risk of stem cell or gene editing-associated carcinogenesis impede the widespread application of these technologies (Azene et al., 2014Azene N. Fu Y. Maurer J.

Therefore, it is urgent to generate stem cell grafts that exhibit increased resistance to stress and reduced tumorigenic potential. Here we used genome editing to replace two FOXO3 phosphorylation sites (Ser253 and Ser315) with alanines (FOXO3S253A, S315A), generating a constitutively active version of FOXO3. Expressing this version of FOXO3 in human VECs (hVECs), human VSMCs (hVSMCs), and human MSCs (hMSCs) (a stem cell component of blood vessels) improved the stress resistance properties of all of these cell types. FOXO3 activation prevented cellular aging and improved cellular resistance to oxidative stress through transcriptional suppression of CSRP1. Furthermore, FOXO3-enhanced human MSCs were resistant to oncogenic transformation, solving a major safety issue associated with cell transplantation therapies. Taken together, these analyses suggest that FOXO3 enhancement improves cellular homeostasis for the three types of vascular cells tested and provides a novel approach for generating safer materials for stem cell-based therapies. To investigate the role of FOXO3 in regulating human vascular cell homeostasis, we first evaluated FOXO3 activity in young versus senescent hMSCs, which are the major cell type within the adventitia of blood vessels (Chen et al., 2014Chen W.C.

FOXO3 protein levels were downregulated in replicatively senescent hMSCs (Figure 1A). In late-passage hMSCs, less nuclear FOXO3 was observed; this decrease was associated with compromised FOXO3 transcriptional activity (Figures 1B and 1C). Furthermore, FOXO3 protein levels were diminished in hMSCs derived from hESCs of Werner syndrome (a condition that drives premature aging) and physiologically aged hMSCs relative to their wild-type or young counterparts (Zhang et al., 2015Zhang W. Li J. Suzuki K. Qu J. Wang P. Zhou J. Liu X. Ren R. Xu X. Ocampo A. et al.Aging stem cells.

These results establish impaired FOXO3 activity as a novel biomarker of hMSC senescence. We next investigated whether vascular cell aging can be alleviated by FOXO3 activation. Immunofluorescence experiments indicated that alanine substitution of two of the three classical phosphorylation sites, Ser253 and Ser315 (referred to as 2SA), was sufficient to redirect FOXO3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in constitutive activation of FOXO3 in hMSCs (Figure S1C). Accordingly, we sought to generate homozygous FOXO32SA/2SA knockin human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using a helper-dependent adenovirus vector (HDAdV) for gene editing (Figure 1E; Liu et al., 2011Liu G.H.

After two rounds of homologous recombination, the resultant FOXO32SA/2SA hESCs exhibited common pluripotent stem cell features, including typical colony morphology, expression of the pluripotency markers, hypomethylation of the OCT4 promoter, as well as in vivo differentiation into three germ layers (Figures S1D–S1F). Cell cycle kinetics and the percentage of Ki67-positive cells were both normal, indicating that the FOXO32SA/2SA knockin had minimal effects on hESC proliferation (Figures S1G and S1H). Further, karyotyping and genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) analyses showed that FOXO32SA/2SA hESCs were genomically stable (Figures S1I and S1J). Together, these data indicate that genetic modification of the FOXO3 locus did not disrupt the typical features of hESCs. We next evaluated the effect of FOXO32SA/2SA on different vascular cell types. First, FOXO3+/+ and FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs were obtained via directed differentiation of hESCs (Wu et al., 2018Wu Z. Zhang W. Song M. Wang W. Wei G. Li W. Lei J. Huang Y. Sang Y. Chan P. et al.Differential stem cell aging kinetics in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and Werner syndrome.Protein Cell. 2018; 9: 333-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FOXO3+/+ and FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs were positive for a series of endothelial cell markers, including CD31, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Orlova et al., 2014Orlova V.V. van den Hil F.E. Petrus-Reurer S. Drabsch Y. Ten Dijke P. Mummery C.L. Generation, expansion and functional analysis of endothelial cells and pericytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 1514-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar; Figures 2A and S2A). FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs also exhibited normal nitric oxide levels (reflecting vasodilatory properties), uptake of DiI (1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate)-labeled acetylated low-density lipoproteins (DiI-ac-LDLs) (Figure S2B), formation of capillary-like structures (Figure S2C), cell migration ability (Figures S2D and S2E), and comparable DNA damage levels (Figure S2F). Wild-type FOXO3 localized to the cytoplasm of hVECs, whereas activated FOXO3 primarily localized to the nuclear fraction in FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs (Figure 2B). Consequently, FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs exhibited moderately higher levels of cell proliferation (Figures 2C and 2D) and increased resistance to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Figure 2E). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of hVECs identified 480 downregulated genes (fold change [FOXO3+/+ versus FOXO32SA/2SA] > 1.5, q < 0.05) and 268 upregulated genes (fold change [FOXO32SA/2SA versus FOXO3+/+] > 1.5, q < 0.05) (Figures S2G and S2H; Table S2). Upregulated genes were enriched in genes associated with stress response pathways, consistent with the observation that FOXO3-enhanced hVECs were resistant to oxidative injury (Figures 2F, 2G, S2I, and S2J; Table S3). In line with the higher levels of cell proliferation observed for FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs, growth-promoting genes were also upregulated in these cells (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2I). We next differentiated FOXO3+/+ and FOXO32SA/2SA hESCs into hVSMCs. The resulting cells expressed markers specific for smooth muscles, including SM22 and Calponin (Figure 3A). FOXO32SA/2SA hVSMCs had increased levels of nuclear FOXO3 and slightly elevated levels of cell proliferation, resembling their hVEC counterparts (Figures 3B–3D, S3A, and S3B). In addition, activation of FOXO3 protected hVSMCs from oxidative stress-induced cell apoptosis (Figures 3E and S3C–S3F; Tables S2 and S3). Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of FOXO3-enhanced hVSMCs and hVECs exhibited upregulated FOXO3 target genes (fold change > 1.5, q < 0.05) and high genomic integrity, as determined by analyzing genome-wide CNVs (Figures S3G–S3J). We subsequently evaluated the vasculogenesis activity of FOXO3-activated hVECs and hVSMCs in vivo using a well-established murine model of ischemia (Lian et al., 2010Lian Q. Zhang Y. Zhang J. Zhang H.K. Wu X. Zhang Y. Lam F.F. Kang S. Xia J.C.

Izpisua Belmonte J.C. et al.Genetic enhancement in cultured human adult stem cells conferred by a single nucleotide recoding.Cell Res. 2017; 27: 1178-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The administration of a mixture of FOXO32SA/2SA hVECs and hVSMCs into the mouse ischemic hindlimb muscles led to a more rapid recovery of blood flow than seen with FOXO3+/+ cells (measurements were taken every 4 days after implantation) (Figures 3F and 3G). In addition, activation of FOXO3 in hVECs and hVSMCs resulted in the formation of more vessels with human antigens at the injury sites (Figure S3K). We also observed less limb necrosis in the FOXO32SA/2SA hVEC and hVSMC treatment group (Figure S3L). Taken together, these results indicate that the FOXO3 activation improved cellular function of hVECs and hVSMCs by increasing their self-renewal potential, making them resistant to oxidative stress, and promoting vasculature repair. Human MSCs localize to the adventitia of blood vessels and are important for maintaining blood vessel homeostasis and for repairing damage (Chen et al., 2014Chen W.C. Saparov A. Corselli M. Crisan M.

FOXO3+/+ and FOXO32SA/2SA hMSCs derived from hESCs both exhibited features typical of mesenchymal progenitor cells, including expression of the hMSC markers CD90, CD73, and CD105 and epigenetic silencing of the OCT4 promoter (Figures 4A, S4A, and S4B). The multi-lineage differentiation potential of FOXO32SA/2SA hMSCs was verified using tri-lineage differentiation (Figure S4C). Genome-wide CNV analysis revealed that genomic stability was well maintained in FOXO3-enhanced hMSCs (Figure S4D). As seen with hVECs and hVSMCs, FOXO3 was present in the nuclear fraction of FOXO32SA/2SA hMSCs (Figures 4B and S4E). Next we investigated the effect of FOXO3 activation on hMSC homeostasis. Reporter assays verified an increase in FOXO3 transcriptional activity in genetically edited cells (Figure 4C). Compared with FOXO3+/+ hMSCs, FOXO32SA/2SA hMSCs consistently exhibited decreased senescence-associated (SA) β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity, increased cell proliferation, elongated telomeres, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Figures 4D–4G, S4F, and S4G). They also showed improved nuclear and chromosomal architecture and less activation of DNA damage responses (Figures 4H and S4H–S4K; Tables S2 and S3; López-Otín et al., 2013López-Otín C.

Moreover, FOXO3 activation rendered MSCs refractory to H2O2-induced cellular apoptosis (Figure 4I). Transcriptomic analyses indicated that genetic activation of FOXO3 upregulated 32 known FOXO3 target genes (fold change > 1.5, q < 0.05) (Figure 4J, S4L, and S4M). Although, in WT MSCs, replicative stress resulted in downregulation of genes associated with the maintenance of chromosome organization, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and stress resistance, FOXO3-enhanced MSCs were less sensitive to replicative senescence-associated gene expression changes (Figures 4K and S4N–S4S; Table S4). Taken together, these results indicate that FOXO3 activation improved the fitness of hMSCs. Finally, we tested whether FOXO3 activation alleviated cellular senescence in the context of Werner syndrome (WS), a premature aging disorder (Geng et al., 2018Geng L. Liu Z. Zhang W. Li W. Wu Z.

FOXO3-enhanced, WS-specific hMSCs (FOXO32SA/2SA WRN−/− hMSCs) were generated using a combination of gene editing and hESC-directed differentiation procedures (Figures S4T and S4U). As expected, FOXO3 activation improved self-renewal activity and reduced aging hallmarks in WRN−/− hMSCs (Figures S4V–S4Y), further indicating that FOXO3 activation was capable of delaying hMSCs senescence, even in the context of pathological aging. To understand the molecular mechanism by which FOXO3 activation improved the functionality of vascular cells, we analy"
https://openalex.org/W2904730265,"By combining computational, morphological, and functional analyses, this study relates latent markers of associative threat learning to overt post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in combat veterans. Using reversal learning, we found that symptomatic veterans showed greater physiological adjustment to cues that did not predict what they had expected, indicating greater sensitivity to prediction errors for negative outcomes. This exaggerated weighting of prediction errors shapes the dynamic learning rate (associability) and value of threat predictive cues. The degree to which the striatum tracked the associability partially mediated the positive correlation between prediction-error weights and PTSD symptoms, suggesting that both increased prediction-error weights and decreased striatal tracking of associability independently contribute to PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, decreased neural tracking of value in the amygdala, in addition to smaller amygdala volume, independently corresponded to higher PTSD symptom severity. These results provide evidence for distinct neurocomputational contributions to PTSD symptoms."

We show that mice with DAD knock-in mutations have memory deficits, reduced anxiety levels, and reduced social interactions. Mice with NCOR1 and NORC2 depletion specifically in GABAergic neurons (NS-V mice) recapitulated the memory deficits and had reduced GABAA receptor subunit α2 (GABRA2) expression in lateral hypothalamus GABAergic (LHGABA) neurons. This was associated with LHGABA neuron hyperexcitability and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation, through a monosynaptic LHGABA to CA3GABA projection. Optogenetic activation of this projection caused memory deficits, whereas targeted manipulation of LHGABA or CA3GABA neuron activity reversed memory deficits in NS-V mice. We describe de novo variants in NCOR1, NCOR2 or HDAC3 in patients with intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings identify a hypothalamus–hippocampus projection that may link endocrine signals with synaptic plasticity through NCOR-mediated regulation of GABA signaling. Zhou et al. show that NCORs regulate memory and synaptic plasticity through a GABAergic hypothalamus–hippocampus projection in mice, and that variants in NCOR1 and NCOR2 are linked to intellectual disability and neurodevelopmental defects in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2909113451,"Although antioxidants promote melanoma metastasis, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in other stages of melanoma progression is controversial. Moreover, genes regulating ROS have not been functionally characterized throughout the entire tumor progression in mouse models of cancer. To address this question, we crossed mice-bearing knock-out of Klf9, an ubiquitous transcriptional regulator of oxidative stress, with two conditional melanocytic mouse models: BrafCA mice, where BrafV600E causes premalignant melanocytic hyperplasia, and BrafCA/Pten−/− mice, where BrafV600E and loss of Pten induce primary melanomas and metastases. Klf9 deficiency inhibited premalignant melanocytic hyperplasia in BrafCA mice but did not affect formation and growth of BrafCA/Pten−/− primary melanomas. It also, as expected, promoted BrafCA/Pten−/− metastasis. Treatment with antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine phenocopied loss of Klf9 including suppression of melanocytic hyperplasia. We were interested in a different role of Klf9 in regulation of cell proliferation in BrafCA and BrafCA/Pten−/− melanocytic cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BRAFV600E signaling transcriptionally upregulated KLF9 and that KLF9-dependent ROS were required for full-scale activation of ERK1/2 and induction of cell proliferation by BRAFV600E. PTEN depletion in BRAFV600E-melanocytes did not further activate ERK1/2 and cell proliferation, but rendered these phenotypes insensitive to KLF9 and ROS. Our data identified an essential role of KLF9-dependent ROS in BRAFV600E signaling in premalignant melanocytes, offered an explanation to variable role of ROS in premalignant and transformed melanocytic cells and suggested a novel mechanism for suppression of premalignant growth by topical antioxidants."

How this multilayered cell envelope is assembled remains unclear. Here, we tracked the assembly dynamics of different envelope layers in Corynebacterium glutamicum and Mycobacterium smegmatis by using metabolic labeling and found that the septal cell envelope is assembled sequentially in both species. Additionally, we demonstrate that in C. glutamicum, the peripheral peptidoglycan layer at the septal junction remains contiguous throughout septation, forming a diffusion barrier for the fluid mycomembrane. This diffusion barrier is resolved through perforations in the peripheral peptidoglycan, thus leading to the confluency of the mycomembrane before daughter cell separation (V snapping). Furthermore, the same junctional peptidoglycan also serves as a mechanical link holding the daughter cells together and undergoes mechanical fracture during V snapping. Finally, we show that normal V snapping in C. glutamicum depends on complete assembly of the septal cell envelope. Assembly of the mycobacterial cell envelope layers, including peptidoglycan (PG) and the mycomembrane (MM), is synchronous during elongation, when a mobile fraction of the MM diffuses into the septum after thinning of the diffusion barrier formed by PG."
https://openalex.org/W2912814328,"Impairment of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus causes cognitive deficits; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate neural stem cell (NSC) function. With the use of a transgenic mouse line with conditional ablation of the miR-17-92 cluster in nestin lineage NSCs, we tested the hypothesis that the miR-17-92 cluster regulates adult neurogenesis and cognitive function in vivo. Compared with wild-type mice, ablation of the miR-17-92 cluster significantly reduced the number of proliferating NSCs and neuroblasts and neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and significantly impaired hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as assayed by social recognition memory, novel object recognition, and Morris water-maze tests. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant correlation between newly generated neuroblasts in the DG and cognition deficits in miR-17-92 knockout (KO) mice. Western blot analysis showed that conditional KO of the miR-17-92 cluster significantly increased and reduced a cytoskeleton-associated protein, Enigma homolog 1 (ENH1), and its downstream transcription factor, inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1), respectively, as well as increased phosphatase and tensin homolog gene. These proteins are related to neuronal differentiation.

https://openalex.org/W2909508164,"Drug-based strategies to overcome tumour resistance to radiotherapy (R-RT) remain limited by the single-agent toxicity of traditional radiosensitizers (for example, platinums) and a lack of targeted alternatives. In a screen for compounds that restore radiosensitivity in p53 mutant zebrafish while tolerated in non-irradiated wild-type animals, we identified the benzimidazole anthelmintic oxfendazole. Surprisingly, oxfendazole acts via the inhibition of IRAK1, a kinase thus far implicated in interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) immune responses. IRAK1 drives R-RT in a pathway involving IRAK4 and TRAF6 but not the IL-1R/TLR–IRAK adaptor MyD88. Rather than stimulating nuclear factor-κB, radiation-activated IRAK1 prevented apoptosis mediated by the PIDDosome complex (comprising PIDD, RAIDD and caspase-2). Countering this pathway with IRAK1 inhibitors suppressed R-RT in tumour models derived from cancers in which TP53 mutations predict R-RT. Moreover, IRAK1 inhibitors synergized with inhibitors of PIN1, a prolyl isomerase essential for IRAK1 activation in response to pathogens and, as shown here, in response to ionizing radiation. These data identify an IRAK1 radiation-response pathway as a rational chemoradiation therapy target. Performing a small-molecule screen, Liu et al. identify IRAK as a regulator of PIDDosome activity and tumour radioresistance, and demonstrate a synergistic effect of targeting IRAK1 and PIN1 in response to ionizing radiation."

Transgenic mice are still undoubtedly the most popular and extensively used animal models for studying Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. While these murine models generally overexpress human tau in the mouse brain or specific brain regions, there are differences between endogenous mouse tau and human tau protein. Among them, a main difference between human and mouse tau is the presence of a short motif spanning residues 18 to 28 in the human tau protein that is missing in murine tau, and which could be at least partially responsible for that different susceptibility across species. Here we report novel data using affinity chromatography analysis indicating that the sequence containing human tau residues 18 to 28 acts a binding motif for End Binding proteins and that this interaction could facilitate tau secretion to the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W2913728974,"Cancer genome sequencing studies have focused on identifying oncogenic mutations. However, mutational profiling alone may not always help dissect underlying epigenetic dependencies in tumorigenesis. Nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that regulates transcriptional architecture and is involved in cell fate commitment. We demonstrate that loss of MBD3, an important NuRD scaffold, in human primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells associates with leukemic NuRD. Interestingly, CHD4, an intact ATPase subunit of leukemic NuRD, coimmunoprecipitates and participates with H3K27Me3/2-demethylase KDM6A to induce expression of atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factors, dedicator of cytokinesis (DOCK) 5 and 8 (DOCK5/8), promoting Rac GTPase signaling. Mechanistically, MBD3 deficiency caused loss of histone deacytelase 1 occupancy with a corresponding increase in KDM6A, CBP, and H3K27Ac on DOCK5/8 loci, leading to derepression of gene expression. Importantly, the Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort reveals that DOCK5/ 8 levels are correlated with MBD3 and KDM6A, and DOCK5/ 8 expression is significantly increased in patients who are MBD3 low and KDM6A high with a poor survival. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of DOCK signaling selectively attenuates AML cell survival. Because MBD3 and KDM6A have been implicated in metastasis, our results may suggest a general phenomenon in tumorigenesis. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for MBD3-deficient NuRD in leukemia pathobiology and inform a novel epistasis between NuRD and KDM6A toward maintenance of oncogenic gene expression in AML.-Biswas, M., Chatterjee, S. S., Boila, L. D., Chakraborty, S., Banerjee, D., Sengupta, A. MBD3/NuRD loss participates with KDM6A program to promote DOCK5/8 expression and Rac GTPase activation in human acute myeloid leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2908533946,"One of the mechanisms by which advanced prostate cancer develops resistance to androgen deprivation therapy is the elevated expression of C-terminally truncated androgen receptor (AR) variants. These variants, such as AR-V7, originate from aberrant splicing of the AR pre-mRNA and the inclusion of a cryptic exon containing a premature stop codon in the mRNA. The resulting loss of the ligand-binding domain allows AR-V7 to act as a constitutively active transcription factor. Here, we designed two antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) directed against cryptic splicing signals within the AR pre-mRNA. These two AONs, AON-ISE and AON-ESE, demonstrated high efficiency in silencing AR-V7 splicing without affecting full-length AR expression. The subsequent downregulation of AR-V7-target gene UBE2C was accompanied by inhibition of androgen-independent cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-derived cell line models 22Rv1, DuCaP, and VCaP. Our results show that splicing-directed AONs can efficiently prevent expression of AR-V7, providing an attractive new therapeutic option for the treatment of CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W2912150285,"As fetal gestational age increases, other modalities such as ultrasound have demonstrated increased levels of heterogeneity in the normal placenta. In this study, we introduce and apply ROI-based texture analysis to a retrospective fetal MRI database to characterize the second-order statistics of placenta and to evaluate the relationship between heterogeneity and gestational age. Positive correlations were observed for several Haralick texture metrics derived from fetal-brain specific T2-weighted and gravid uterus T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, confirming a quantitative increase in placental heterogeneity with gestational age. Our study shows the importance of identifying baseline MR textural changes at certain gestational ages from which placental diseased states may be compared. Specifically, when evaluating for placental invasion or insufficiency, findings should be evaluated in the context of the normal placental aging process, which occurs throughout gestation."
https://openalex.org/W2910738005,"Attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lmat-LLO) represents a valuable anticancer vaccine and drug delivery platform. Here we show that in vitro Lmat-LLO causes ROS production and, in turn, apoptotic killing of a wide variety of melanoma cells, irrespectively of their stage, mutational status, sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors or degree of stemness. We also show that, when administered in the therapeutic setting to Braf/Pten genetically engineered mice, Lmat-LLO causes a strong decrease in the size and volume of primary melanoma tumors, as well as a reduction of the metastatic burden. At the molecular level, we confirm that the anti-melanoma activity exerted in vivo by Lmat-LLO depends also on its ability to potentiate the immune response of the organism against the infected tumor. Our data pave the way to the preclinical testing of listeria-based immunotherapeutic strategies against metastatic melanoma, using a genetically engineered mouse rather than xenograft models."
https://openalex.org/W2908835062,"Holliday junction (HJ) resolution by resolving enzymes is essential for chromosome segregation and recombination-mediated DNA repair. HJs undergo two types of structural dynamics that determine the outcome of recombination: conformer exchange between two isoforms and branch migration. However, it is unknown how the preferred branch point and conformer are achieved between enzyme binding and HJ resolution given the extensive binding interactions seen in static crystal structures. Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of resolving enzymes from bacteriophages (T7 endonuclease I), bacteria (RuvC), fungi (GEN1) and humans (hMus81-Eme1) showed that both types of HJ dynamics still occur after enzyme binding. These dimeric enzymes use their multivalent interactions to achieve this, going through a partially dissociated intermediate in which the HJ undergoes nearly unencumbered dynamics. This evolutionarily conserved property of HJ resolving enzymes provides previously unappreciated insight on how junction resolution, conformer exchange and branch migration may be coordinated."

https://openalex.org/W2915009578,"Objective To achieve an optimal effect in patients with sepsis at the emergency department (ED), the gentamicin peak-concentration should be sufficiently high (i.e. peak-concentration/MIC ≥8–10). ICU patients with sepsis often need higher gentamicin doses to achieve sufficiently high peak-concentrations. The aim of this study is to investigate which dose is needed to reach adequate peak-concentrations in patients presenting with sepsis at the ED. Methods Patients with sepsis at the ED were included from August 2015 until February 2017. Peak-concentrations were measured in blood 30 minutes after the first gentamicin dose. The study consisted of three phases. In the first phase, peak-concentrations were measured after a standard dose of 5mg/kg. In the second phase, a simulation ((peak-concentration/actual dose) × simulated dose) was performed to determine which dose was needed to reach adequate gentamicin peak-concentrations of ≥16mg/L. In the third phase, peak-concentrations were measured for the best simulated dose. Results In phase one, of 86 patients who received a dose of 5mg/kg, 34 (39.5%) patients did not reach the target peak-concentration of ≥16mg/L, and 73 (84.9%) did not reach ≥20mg/L. In phase two, the simulation showed that with a dose of 7mg/kg 83 (96.5%) patients would reach peak-concentrations ≥16mg/L, and 67 (77.9%) of ≥20mg/L. In phase three, 53 patients received a dose of 7mg/kg, of whom 45 (84.9%) reached peak-concentrations of ≥16mg/L, and 31 (58.5%) of ≥20mg/L. Conclusion Patients with sepsis at the ED need higher doses of gentamicin. A dose of 7mg/kg is needed to achieve adequate peak-concentrations in the majority of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2914971378,"Background Several studies have shown that patients with a unilateral amputation have an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee of their sound leg. OBJECTIVE: The first objective was to investigate whether amputees are more frequently affected by gon-, cox- or polyarthritis as well as back pain or spinal disorders. We hypothesized that mobile and active transfemoral amputees more often experience OA and spinal disorders than non-amputees. The second objective was to compare the mean age of the patients with OA. Patients Patients with a unilateral transfemoral amputation (n = 1,569) and five abled-body control groups (each n = 1,569) matched in terms of age and gender resulting in total of 9,414 participants. Methods Groups were analyzed regarding the prevalence of six selected diagnoses regarding musculoskeletal disorders. Results A significantly decreased prevalence of OA and specific disorders of the spine in transfemoral amputees compared to a control group was found. The amputees with OA are significantly younger than patients with OA in the control group. Conclusion The results from the presented study contradict previously published literature. Apparently circumstances of life play an important role, like physical work and strenuous activities which are likely to be underrepresented in the amputee group. The results of the study need to be used cautiously due to the major limitation of the study which is the lack of detail in individual patients caused by the methodology."
https://openalex.org/W4205554352,"Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3), a MAP3K member has been envisioned as a viable drug target in cancer, yet its detailed function and signaling is not fully elucidated. We identified that MLK3 tightly associates with an oncogene, PAK1. Mammalian PAK1 being a Ste20 (MAP4K) member, we tested whether it is an upstream regulator of MLK3. In contrast to our hypothesis, MLK3 activated PAK1 kinase activity directly, as well as in the cells. Although, MLK3 can phosphorylate PAK1 on Ser133 and Ser204 sites, PAK1S133A mutant is constitutively active, whereas, PAK1S204A is not activated by MLK3. Stable overexpression of PAK1S204A in breast cancer cells, impedes migration, invasion, and NFĸB activity. In vivo breast cancer cell tumorigenesis is significantly reduced in tumors expressing PAK1S204A mutant. These results suggest that mammalian PAK1 does not act as a MAP4K and MLK3-induced direct activation of PAK1 plays a key role in breast cancer tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2913891525,"The misinformation effect is one of the major threats for the quality of witness testimony. It involves including of information that is inconsistent with the course of an event, and which originates from sources other than the event itself, into a witness's report of the event. In the present article research is presented aiming at reducing the tendency to rely on misinformation. After viewing a video clip, participants received a post-event narrative describing the events in the film which in the misled group included some incorrect information about the clip. They were then administered reinforced self-affirmation (RSA), a technique aiming at boosting self-confidence in order to increase the tendency to rely on own memory instead of external cues. This technique consists of self-affirmation by means of writing down one’s greatest achievements in life and manipulated positive feedback. Feedback about memory, perception and independence of judgements was analyzed. All types of feedback effectively reduced the misinformation effect. Mediation analyzes confirmed that RSA operates via increased self-confidence or self-independence."
https://openalex.org/W2911508554,"Purpose To evaluate knowledge of secondhand smoke (SHS) risks, sources of information, and associated factors and behaviors among hospital staff. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey using a 40-item self-administered questionnaire among 328 employees at a university hospital. The questions on representative diseases related to SHS were used to measure the degree of knowledge of SHS. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the correlation between SHS knowledge scores and variables. Results Females had better SHS knowledge scores than males, regardless of smoking status (p<0.05). SHS knowledge was positively correlated with cessation education in males, non-smokers, and the total sample (β = 3.950, 2.356, and 2.684, respectively, p<0.05). It was correlated with the experience of any SHS exposure-related symptoms in males, non-smokers, and the total sample (β = 3.950, 2.356, and 2.684, respectively, p<0.05) and discomfort when exposed to SHS in non-smokers and the total sample (β = 0.670 and 0.821, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusion SHS knowledge is high among females, when hospital staff are educated about SHS risks, and when they have experienced any SHS exposure-related symptoms or felt uncomfortable when exposed to SHS. SHS risk education is an effective tool to increase SHS knowledge in hospital staff."
https://openalex.org/W2912181549,"We determined if HIV-1 expression in transgenic (HIV-1-Tg) rats enhanced hepatic genomic changes related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and lipogenesis during cART-treatment, and assessed effects of Mg-supplementation. A clinically used cART (atazanavir-ritonavir+Truvada) was given orally to control and HIV-1-Tg rats (18 weeks) with normal or 6-fold dietary-Mg. Oxidative/nitrosative and lipogenic genes were determined by real-time RT-PCR. cART induced a 4-fold upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in HIV-1-Tg-rats, but not in controls; Tg rats displayed a 2.5-fold higher expression. Both were completely prevented by Mg-supplementation. Nrf2 (Nuclear erythroid-derived factor 2), a master transcription factor controlling redox homeostasis, was down-regulated 50% in HIV-Tg rats, and reduced further to 25% in Tg+cART-rats. Two downstream antioxidant genes, heme oxygenase-1(HmOX1) and Glutathione-S-transferase(GST), were elevated in HIV-Tg alone but were suppressed by cART treatment. Decreased Nrf2 in Tg±cART were normalized by Mg-supplementation along with the reversal of altered HmOX1 and GST expression. Concomitantly, iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) was upregulated 2-fold in Tg+cART rats, which was reversed by Mg-supplementation. In parallel, cART-treatment led to substantial increases in plasma 8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, and RBC-GSSG (oxidized glutathione) levels in HIV-1-Tg rats; all indices of oxidative/nitrosative stress were suppressed by Mg-supplementation. Both plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were elevated in Tg+cART rats, but were lowered by Mg-supplementation. Thus, the synergistic effects of cART and HIV-1 expression on lipogenic and oxidative/nitrosative effects were revealed at the genomic and biochemical levels. Down-regulation of Nrf2 in the Tg+cART rats suggested their antioxidant response was severely compromised; these abnormal metabolic and oxidative stress effects were effectively attenuated by Mg-supplementation at the genomic level."
https://openalex.org/W2911551352,"This study investigates the effects of the number of medical institutions visited on risk of death. This study conducted a nested case-control design using the National Health Insurance Service-Senior database from 2002 to 2013. Cases were defined as those with death among outpatients who had first diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (E10-E14) after entry into the base cohort and controls were selected by incidence density sampling and matched to cases based on age, and sex. Our main results were presented by conditional logistic regression for nested case-controls design. Of total 55,558 final study samples, there were 9,313 (16.8%) cases and 46,245 (83.2%) controls. With an increase by one point in the number of hospitals per medical utilization, risk of death significantly increased by 4.1% (odds ratio (OR): 1.041, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.039-1.043). In both medical utilization and number of hospitals, those with high medical utilization (OR: 1.065, 95% CI: 1.059-1.070) and number of hospitals (OR: 1.049, 95% CI: 1.041-1.058) for risk of death were significantly higher than those with low medical utilization (OR: 1.040, 95% CI: 1.037-1.043) and number of hospitals (OR: 1.029, 95% CI: 1.027-1.032), respectively. The number of medical institution visited was significantly associated with risk of death. Therefore, diabetics should be warned about the potential of risk of death incurred from excessive access to medical utilizations."
https://openalex.org/W2913559106,"In a previously published study, higher levels of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) were observed in recurrent post-chemotherapy ovarian cancers compared to primary tumors. Syk inhibition was found to stabilize microtubules and potentiate paclitaxel activity in cellular models of taxane-resistant ovarian cancers. We further studied the effects of Syk inhibition on paclitaxel activity in Syk(+) ovarian cancer cell models and in variants selected for taxane resistance. Syk inhibition was accomplished using RNAi and by exposure to the small molecule competitive inhibitor R406, the active metabolite of fostamatinib. Exposure to R406 or to a SYK-specific pool of siRNAs did not alter taxane activity in the OVCAR-3 cell line, which has the most Syk content in our panel of nine human ovarian cancer cell lines. However, treatment with R406 sensitised the multidrug resistant (MDR) variants MES-SA/Dx5 and SK-OV-3/TR to paclitaxel in a dose-dependent manner resulting from the inhibition of the ABCB1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter. These observations are Syk-independent since both MDR cell models are Syk negative. R406 modulated resistance to other known P-gp substrates, and we observed orthovanadate-sensitive ATPase stimulation resulting from treatment with R406. These data indicate that the chemo-sensitizing effect of R406 in taxane-resistant cells previously reported was not associated with Syk but resulted from the modulation of P-gp-mediated MDR."
