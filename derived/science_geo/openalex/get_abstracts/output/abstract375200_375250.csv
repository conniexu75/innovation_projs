https://openalex.org/W2102413929,"We conducted a genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer in 3,851 affected individuals (cases) and 3,934 unaffected controls drawn from 12 prospective cohort studies and 8 case-control studies. Based on a logistic regression model for genotype trend effect that was adjusted for study, age, sex, self-described ancestry and five principal components, we identified eight SNPs that map to three loci on chromosomes 13q22.1, 1q32.1 and 5p15.33. Two correlated SNPs, rs9543325 (P = 3.27 x 10(-11), per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% CI 1.18-1.35) and rs9564966 (P = 5.86 x 10(-8), per-allele OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30), map to a nongenic region on chromosome 13q22.1. Five SNPs on 1q32.1 map to NR5A2, and the strongest signal was at rs3790844 (P = 2.45 x 10(-10), per-allele OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.84). A single SNP, rs401681 (P = 3.66 x 10(-7), per-allele OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.27), maps to the CLPTM1L-TERT locus on 5p15.33, which is associated with multiple cancers. Our study has identified common susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer that warrant follow-up studies."

For two of these LRR-RKs, the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 and the flagellin receptor FLS2, interaction with the LRR receptor-like kinase BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1) was shown to be required for signal transduction. Here we report that FLS2·BAK1 heteromerization occurs almost instantaneously after perception of the ligand, the flagellin-derived peptide flg22. Flg22 can induce formation of a stable FLS2·BAK1 complex in microsomal membrane preparations in vitro, and the kinase inhibitor K-252a does not prevent complex formation. A kinase dead version of BAK1 associates with FLS2 in a flg22-dependent manner but does not restore responsiveness to flg22 in cells of bak1 plants, demonstrating that kinase activity of BAK1 is essential for FLS2 signaling. Furthermore, using in vivo phospholabeling, we are able to detect de novo phosphorylation of both FLS2 and BAK1 within 15 s of stimulation with flg22. Similarly, brassinolide induces BAK1 phosphorylation within seconds. Other triggers of plant defense, such as bacterial EF-Tu and the endogenous AtPep1 likewise induce rapid formation of heterocomplexes consisting of de novo phosphorylated BAK1 and proteins representing the ligand-specific binding receptors EF-Tu receptor and Pep1 receptor 1, respectively.

IntroductionOne of the central themes in cell biology is the sensing of extracellular chemical signals through cell surface receptors: How does the event of receptor-ligand interaction on the outside of the cell activate a signal transduction chain in the inside of the cell? In higher plants, the most prominent class of membrane receptors is formed by proteins with intracellular serine/threonine-type protein kinases. These receptors account for ∼2.5–4% of all proteins encoded by the genome of a plant (1.Shiu S.H. Karlowski W.M. Pan R. Tzeng Y.H. Mayer K.F. Li W.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1220-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, there is still little experimental evidence on the molecular activation mechanisms of plant transmembrane receptor kinases. Current models are based on the precedent of animal receptor tyrosine kinases where ligand binding causes receptor tyrosine kinases to form homo- or hetero-oligomers, followed by transphosphorylation (2.Schlessinger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In the case of the epidermal growth factor receptor, these phosphorylation events occur within 60 s of receptor activation (3.Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar).The best studied plant transmembrane receptor kinase is BRI1, the receptor for the brassinosteroid growth hormones (4.Wang Z.Y. Seto H. Fujioka S. Yoshida S. Chory J. Nature. 2001; 410: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). BRI1 is one of the 224 members of LRR-RKs 2The abbreviations used are: LRR-RKleucine-rich-repeat receptor kinaseBLbrassinolideEFREF-Tu receptorPEPR1Pep1 receptor 1IPimmunoprecipitationSERKsomatic embryogenesis receptor kinase. in Arabidopsis (5.Shiu S.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding BRI1 interacts with a second LRR receptor-like kinase named BAK1 (6.Li J. Wen J.

Cell. 2002; 110: 203-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Two further well characterized plant LRR-RKs are the flagellin receptor FLS2 (flagellin sensing 2) (8.Chinchilla D. Bauer Z. Regenass M. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and the EF-Tu receptor (EFR) (9.Kunze G. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Niehaus K. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3496-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). FLS2 perceives a generally conserved 22-amino acid epitope (flg22) of bacterial flagellin (8.Chinchilla D. Bauer Z. Regenass M. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), and EFR senses the N-terminal amino acids (elf18/elf26) of bacterial elongation factor EF-Tu (10.Zipfel C. Kunze G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A. Jones J.D. Boller T. Felix G. Cell. 2006; 125: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). FLS2 and EFR are typical pattern recognition receptors involved in plant immunity and render plants more resistant to bacterial attack (10.Zipfel C. Kunze G. Chinchilla D. Caniard A. Jones J.D. Boller T. Felix G. Cell. 2006; 125: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar, 11.Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Navarro L. Oakeley E.J. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2004; 428: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). However, pattern recognition receptors are also involved in the recognition of endogenous peptide signals, such as the wound-induced AtPep1, which is recognized by the LRR-RK PEPR1 and is suggested to be part of a positive feedback loop to amplify the plant immune response (12.Huffaker A. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13.Yamaguchi Y. Pearce G. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Surprisingly, in recent work we and others found that stimulation with flg22 leads to heteromerization of FLS2 with BAK1, the same associated kinase employed by the hormone receptor BRI1 (15.Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Kemmerling B. Nürnberger T. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 16.Heese A. Hann D.R. Gimenez-Ibanez S. Jones A.M. He K. Li J. Schroeder J.I. Peck S.C. Rathjen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12217-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Consistently, bak1 mutants show strongly reduced responses to flg22, indicating that complex formation of FLS2 with BAK1 is essential for flg22 signaling. Despite these recent advances, the biochemical function of BAK1 and the precise mechanism underlying BAK1·FLS2 interaction and activation of the flagellin receptor remain unclear. In the case of brassinosteroid perception, it was shown by means of mobility shift and mass spectrometry that BRI1 and BAK1 are transphosphorylating in vivo, resulting in amplification of brassinosteroid signaling (17.Wang X. Kota U. He K. Blackburn K. Li J. Goshe M.B. Huber S.C. Clouse S.D. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 220-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 18.Oh M.H. Wang X. Kota U. Goshe M.B. Clouse S.D. Huber S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19.Yun H.S. Bae Y.H. Lee Y.J. Chang S.C. Kim S.K. Li J. Nam K.H. Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, these phosphorylation events have been studied only after a considerable lag time of 20–90 min following ligand perception. In contrast, there is currently no direct evidence for phosphorylation of BAK1 and FLS2 in response to flagellin treatment. This is of particular interest because FLS2 does not exhibit a conserved arginine-aspartic acid (RD) motif in the catalytic site. This special class of non-RD kinases generally shows weak autophosphorylation activity (20.Dardick C. Ronald P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: 14-28Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar).In previous work we reported that FLS2 associates with BAK1 within ∼2 min of treatment with the flg22 ligand, concomitantly with the early physiological responses observed in Arabidopsis cells (15.Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Kemmerling B. Nürnberger T. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Here we performed a more detailed kinetic analysis, showing that heteromerization of FLS2 and BAK1 occurs almost instantaneously and is independent of kinase activity. Using an in vivo labeling approach with radioactive orthophosphate, we studied the dynamics of phosphorylation events occurring within the receptor complex. Thereby, we observed that rapid heteromerization with BAK1 and phosphorylation induced by ligand perception are features common to various LRR-RKs, including BRI1 and the pattern recognition receptors EFR and PEPR1. Thus, the in vivo phospholabeling approach described in this study represents a new tool to detect plant receptors that biochemically interact and rely on BAK1 as a signaling partner.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to investigate how early signaling events such as phosphorylation of plant LRR-RKs, exemplified by FLS2 and BAK1, are temporally connected with the activation of these receptors. We used in vivo labeling with short pulses of [33P]orthophosphate, which allowed us to study de novo phosphorylation events occurring during the first seconds after ligand stimulation. This approach complements and differs from other methods like mass spectrometry or Western blot analysis detecting phospho-residues that have been successfully used for the characterization of the phosphorylation status of the BRI1-BAK1 system (17.Wang X. Kota U. He K. Blackburn K. Li J. Goshe M.B. Huber S.C. Clouse S.D. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 220-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 18.Oh M.H. Wang X. Kota U. Goshe M.B. Clouse S.D. Huber S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 19.Yun H.S. Bae Y.H. Lee Y.J. Chang S.C. Kim S.K. Li J. Nam K.H. Mol. Cells. 2009; 27: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study we show that phosphorylation of the FLS2·BAK1 complex is concomitant to the heteromerization process and is an extremely quick and specific event because it appears within 15 s of stimulation with flg22. In accordance with a role in receptor-mediated signaling, these phosphorylations clearly precede all of the responses and intracellular signaling events known so far (40.Boller T. Felix G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2009; 60: 379-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of BAK1 and phosphorylation of FLS2 seem to be tightly connected because both events exhibit a dose dependence for the flg22 ligand that correlates closely with the saturation curve for binding of flg22 to FLS2 (22.Bauer Z. Gómez-Gómez L. Boller T. Felix G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45669-45676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), supporting the model that each flg22 molecule that binds to a FLS2 receptor site triggers formation and phosphorylation of a FLS2·BAK1 complex. Whether these complexes represent heterodimers or higher oligomerization states with a different stoichiometry of FLS2 and BAK1 remains to be studied.The protein kinase activity itself seems not required for complex formation. First, treatment with a general inhibitor of protein kinases inhibits de novo phosphorylation of BAK1 and FLS2, but it does not inhibit their ligand-induced heteromerization. Second, a kinase dead version of BAK1 can still associate with FLS2, although activation of downstream signaling is blocked. Similarly, the heteromerization process and the triggering of stable de novo phosphorylation of FLS2 and BAK1 does not depend on reduced phosphatase activity. Thus, formation of a complex with BAK1 is solely triggered by the interaction of FLS2 with its ligand, and phosphorylation is a consequence rather than a prerequisite for stable complex formation.These results contrast a previous study on the complex formation between BAK1 and BRI1 where the kinase activity of BRI1 but not that of BAK1 was found essential for heteromerization (17.Wang X. Kota U. He K. Blackburn K. Li J. Goshe M.B. Huber S.C. Clouse S.D. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 220-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). These mechanistic differences in the two BAK1-dependent systems may reflect a structural difference because FLS2 belongs to the class of non-RD kinases, whereas BRI1 is a RD kinase (20.Dardick C. Ronald P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: 14-28Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, it would be of great interest to investigate to what extent the FLS2 kinase activity is involved in signal transduction. Interestingly, it has been published that a kinase-inactive FLS2 expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts failed to reconstitute mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation upon flg22 treatment (28.Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). However, in this case the FLS2·BAK1 complex formation was not investigated. Alternatively, because the association and phosphorylation between BRI1 with BAK1 was determined not until 90 min after BL application, the BRI1 kinase activity may be important for long term stability rather than formation of the complex.Importantly, we confirm that BAK1 gets phosphorylated in a similar time frame in response to BL perception as after flg22 treatment, although a phospholabeled signal representing the BRI1 protein was not visible. Thus, we cannot rule out the possibility that BRI1 is phosphorylated in a delayed time course compared with its interaction partner BAK1, which explains the absence of BRI1 phosphorylation at such early time points. However, the absence of phosphorylated BRI1 may also be due to dissociation of the BRI1·BAK1 complex during IP or to the low abundance of this protein in Arabidopsis cultured cells. Considering the small amount of cell tissue used in our experiments, the signal for labeled BRI1 may be below the detection threshold.Moreover, the function of BAK1 seems not restricted to the regulation of the FLS2 and BRI1 signaling pathways. Plants affected in BAK1 have been reported previously to exhibit reduced responses to various microbial elicitors such as the bacterial EF-Tu, cold shock protein, or the oomycete elicitor INF1 (15.Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Kemmerling B. Nürnberger T. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 16.Heese A. Hann D.R. Gimenez-Ibanez S. Jones A.M. He K. Li J. Schroeder J.I. Peck S.C. Rathjen J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 12217-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 38.Shan L. He P. Li J. Heese A. Peck S.C. Nürnberger T. Martin G.B. Sheen J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Additionally, the BAK1 cytosolic domain was reported to interact with the PEPR1 protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay (39.Postel S. Küfner I. Beuter C. Mazzotta S. Schwedt A. Borlotti A. Halter T. Kemmerling B. Nürnberger T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 89: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here, we give biochemical evidence that BAK1 is phosphorylated quickly in Arabidopsis cells after the perception of various peptidic elicitors like flg22, elf26, and AtPep1. Moreover, distinct phosphorylated polypeptides corresponding in size to the expected ligand binding LRR-RKs were co-immunoprecipitated with BAK1 in response to the peptidic elicitors. The fact that BAK1 phosphorylation was not detectable after elicitation of Arabidopsis cells with carbohydrate-based elicitors like chitin is in good agreement with genetic analyses indicating that BAK1 is not required for chitin signaling (38.Shan L. He P. Li J. Heese A. Peck S.C. Nürnberger T. Martin G.B. Sheen J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 4: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the ligand-binding proteins reported here to interact with BAK1 (BRI1, FLS2, EFR, and PEPR1) belong to the LRR receptor kinase family. Thus, the present study supports that recruitment and rapid de novo phosphorylation of BAK1 are general activation mechanisms to many LRR receptor kinases. Further analysis with other elicitors will serve to investigate the functional repertoire of BAK1 and identify new unknown ligand-binding sites, relying on BAK1 as a common signaling partner.One intriguing question remains: how do these LRR-RKs complexes share the same signaling partner, BAK1? It is tempting to hypothesize that ligand-binding receptors are present in preformed, inactive complexes with BAK1 in the absence of ligands. The existence of preformed dimers have been reported in case of the epidermal growth factor receptor in animal cells (41.Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1011-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Supporting this, complex formation between BAK1 and FLS2 was found to be too quick to resolve the kinetic of interaction in a time course. However, using cross-linking agents, we were not able to confirm preassociation of the FLS2 and BAK1 proteins, although cross-linking was successful in samples from stimulated cells. As a alternative approach, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, which already has been employed for probing receptor kinase interactions (42.Shah K. Russinova E. Gadella Jr., T.W. Willemse J. De Vries S.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 43.Ali G.S. Prasad K.V. Day I. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), may be now considered. Rapid association of BAK1 with FLS2 may also be explained by a high mobility of BAK1 and FLS2 in the plasma membrane because it has been reported for nonactivated FLS2 (43.Ali G.S. Prasad K.V. Day I. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Perception of flg22 reduced FLS2 membrane mobility, possibly by complex formation with BAK1 and presumably by association with further components of the signalosome or localization to membrane microdomains (43.Ali G.S. Prasad K.V. Day I. Reddy A.S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2007; 48: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 44.Kierszniowska S. Seiwert B. Schulze W.X. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2009; 8: 612-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, in this study we show that complex formation was successfully induced in microsomes of untreated plant material. Thus, it is unlikely that the ability of FLS2 and BAK1 to heteromerize depends on guidance by cytosolic proteins.Based on our findings, we may draw a model where ligand binding provokes interaction of the extracellular LRRs of FLS2 and BAK1 and thus brings the intracellular kinase domains into contact. Initiation of intracellular signaling can thus be induced by transphosphorylation events between the BAK1 and FLS2 cytosolic domains. In analogy, the crystal structures of the ectodomains of animal innate immune receptors revealed ligand-induced dimerization, which was proposed to stabilize a receptor complex and thus initiate signaling (45.Jin M.S. Kim S.E. Heo J.Y. Lee M.E. Kim H.M. Paik S.G. Lee H. Lee J.O. Cell. 2007; 130: 1071-1082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 46.Liu L. Botos I. Wang Y. Leonard J.N. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Science. 2008; 320: 379-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). With respect to the specificity of signaling output, it will be of importance to investigate whether bacterial elicitors and BL treatment lead to phosphorylations of the same or different sites in BAK1, especially at the early time points defined here.

Surprisingly, in recent work we and others found that stimulation with flg22 leads to heteromerization of FLS2 with BAK1, the same associated kinase employed by the hormone receptor BRI1 (15.Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Kemmerling B. Nürnberger T. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 16.Heese A. Hann D.R. Gimenez-Ibanez S.

Consistently, bak1 mutants show strongly reduced responses to flg22, indicating that complex formation of FLS2 with BAK1 is essential for flg22 signaling. Despite these recent advances, the biochemical function of BAK1 and the precise mechanism underlying BAK1·FLS2 interaction and activation of the flagellin receptor remain unclear. In the case of brassinosteroid perception, it was shown by means of mobility shift and mass spectrometry that BRI1 and BAK1 are transphosphorylating in vivo, resulting in amplification of brassinosteroid signaling (17.Wang X. Kota U. He K. Blackburn K. Li J. Goshe M.B. Huber S.C. Clouse S.D. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 220-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 18.Oh M.H. Wang X. Kota U.

Cells. 2009; 27: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, these phosphorylation events have been studied only after a considerable lag time of 20–90 min following ligand perception. In contrast, there is currently no direct evidence for phosphorylation of BAK1 and FLS2 in response to flagellin treatment. This is of particular interest because FLS2 does not exhibit a conserved arginine-aspartic acid (RD) motif in the catalytic site. This special class of non-RD kinases generally shows weak autophosphorylation activity (20.Dardick C. Ronald P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: 14-28Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar).In previous work we reported that FLS2 associates with BAK1 within ∼2 min of treatment with the flg22 ligand, concomitantly with the early physiological responses observed in Arabidopsis cells (15.Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Kemmerling B. Nürnberger T. Jones J.D. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Here we performed a more detailed kinetic analysis, showing that heteromerization of FLS2 and BAK1 occurs almost instantaneously and is independent of kinase activity. Using an in vivo labeling approach with radioactive orthophosphate, we studied the dynamics of phosphorylation events occurring within the receptor complex. Thereby, we observed that rapid heteromerization with BAK1 and phosphorylation induced by ligand perception are features common to various LRR-RKs, including BRI1 and the pattern recognition receptors EFR and PEPR1. Thus, the in vivo phospholabeling approach described in this study represents a new tool to detect plant receptors that biochemically interact and rely on BAK1 as a signaling partner. One of the central themes in cell biology is the sensing of extracellular chemical signals through cell surface receptors: How does the event of receptor-ligand interaction on the outside of the cell activate a signal transduction chain in the inside of the cell? In higher plants, the most prominent class of membrane receptors is formed by proteins with intracellular serine/threonine-type protein kinases. These receptors account for ∼2.5–4% of all proteins encoded by the genome of a plant (1.Shiu S.H. Karlowski W.M. Pan R. Tzeng Y.H. Mayer K.F. Li W.H. Plant Cell."
https://openalex.org/W2023297465,"Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) have a relatively poor prognosis and cannot be effectively treated with current targeted therapies. We searched for genes that have the potential to be therapeutic targets by identifying genes consistently overexpressed when amplified. Fifty-six TNBCs were subjected to high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), of which 24 were subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis. TNBCs were genetically heterogeneous; no individual focal amplification was present at high frequency, although 78.6% of TNBCs harboured at least one focal amplification. Integration of aCGH and expression data revealed 40 genes significantly overexpressed when amplified, including the known oncogenes and potential therapeutic targets, FGFR2 (10q26.3), BUB3 (10q26.3), RAB20 (13q34), PKN1 (19p13.12) and NOTCH3 (19p13.12). We identified two TNBC cell lines with FGFR2 amplification, which both had constitutive activation of FGFR2. Amplified cell lines were highly sensitive to FGFR inhibitor PD173074, and to RNAi silencing of FGFR2. Treatment with PD173074 induced apoptosis resulting partly from inhibition of PI3K-AKT signalling. Independent validation using publicly available aCGH data sets revealed FGFR2 gene was amplified in 4% (6/165) of TNBC, but not in other subtypes (0/214, P=0.0065). Our analysis demonstrates that TNBCs are heterogeneous tumours with amplifications of FGFR2 in a subgroup of tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2014923657,"Wnt5a is a representative ligand that activates the β-catenin-independent pathway in Wnt signaling. Although it has been reported that abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway is often observed in human prostate cancer, the involvement of the β-catenin-independent pathway in this cancer is unclear. Abnormal expression of Wnt5a and β-catenin was observed in 27 (28%) and 49 (50%) of 98 prostate cancer cases, respectively, by immunohistochemical analyses. Simultaneous expression of Wnt5a and β-catenin was observed in only five cases, suggesting their exclusive expression. The positive detection of Wnt5a was correlated with high Gleason scores and biochemical relapse of prostate cancer, but that of β-catenin was not. Knockdown and overexpression of Wnt5a in human prostate cancer cell lines reduced and stimulated, respectively, their invasion activities, and the invasion activity required Frizzled2 and Ror2 as Wnt receptors. Wnt5a activated Jun-N-terminal kinase through protein kinase D (PKD) and the inhibition of PKD suppressed Wnt5a-dependent cell migration and invasion. In addition, Wnt5a induced the expression of metalloproteinase-1 through the recruitment of JunD to its promoter region. These results suggest that Wnt5a promotes the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and that its expression is involved in relapse after prostatectomy."

They also conduct genome-wide association studies for resistance to seven different antimalarial drugs. Antimalarial drugs impose strong selective pressure on Plasmodium falciparum parasites and leave signatures of selection in the parasite genome1,2; screening for genes under selection may suggest potential drug or immune targets3. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of parasite traits have been hampered by the lack of high-throughput genotyping methods, inadequate knowledge of parasite population history and time-consuming adaptations of parasites to in vitro culture. Here we report the first Plasmodium GWAS, which included 189 culture-adapted P. falciparum parasites genotyped using a custom-built Affymetrix molecular inversion probe 3K malaria panel array with a coverage of ∼1 SNP per 7 kb. Population structure, variation in recombination rate and loci under recent positive selection were detected. Parasite half-maximum inhibitory concentrations for seven antimalarial drugs were obtained and used in GWAS to identify genes associated with drug responses. This study provides valuable tools and insight into the P. falciparum genome."
https://openalex.org/W2016620690,"The ERα signaling pathway is one of the most important and most studied pathways in human breast cancer, yet numerous questions still exist such as how hormonally responsive cancers progress to a more aggressive and hormonally independent phenotype. We have noted that human breast cancers exhibit a strong direct correlation between ERα and E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that ERα signaling might regulate E-cadherin and implying that this regulation might influence epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor progression. To investigate this hypothesis and the mechanisms behind it, we studied the effects of ERα signaling in ERα-transfected ERα-negative breast carcinoma cell lines, the MDA-MB-468 and the MDA-MB-231 and the effects of ERα knockdown in naturally expressing ERα-positive lines, MCF-7 and T47D. When ERα was overexpressed in the ERα-negative lines, 17β-estradiol (E2) decreased slug and increased E-cadherin. Clones maximally exhibiting these changes grew more in clumps and became less invasive in Matrigel. When ERα was knocked down in the ERα-positive lines, slug increased, E-cadherin decreased, cells became spindly and exhibited increased Matrigel invasion. ERα signaling decreased slug expression by two different mechanisms: directly, by repression of slug transcription by the formation of a corepressor complex of ligand-activated ERα, HDAC inhibitor (HDAC1), and nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) that bound the slug promoter in three half-site estrogen response elements (EREs); indirectly by phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK-3β through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt). The GSK-3β inactivation, in turn, repressed slug expression and increased E-cadherin. In human breast cancer cases, there was a strong inverse correlation between slug and ERα and E-cadherin immunoreactivity. Our findings indicate that ERα signaling through slug regulates E-cadherin and EMT."
https://openalex.org/W2044261750,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains a significant public health problem, accounting for over 5% of all cancer-related deaths, and these deaths primarily result from metastatic disease. The molecular processes involved in HNSCC pathogenesis and progression are poorly understood, and here we present experimental evidence for a direct role of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, in HNSCC tumor progression. Using immunohistochemical analysis and transcriptional profiling of archival HNSCC tumor specimens, we found that TrkB and its secreted ligand, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are expresses in greater than 50% of human HNSCC tumors, but not in normal upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) epithelia. Studies with HNSCC cell lines reveal that in vitro stimulation with BDNF, the ligand for TrkB, upregulates the migration and invasion of HNSCC cells, and both transient and stable suppressions of TrkB result in significant abrogation of constitutive and ligand-mediated migration and invasion. Furthermore, enforced overexpression of TrkB results in altered expression of molecular mediators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of Twist. Using an in vivo mouse model of HNSCC, we were able to show that downregulation of TrkB suppresses tumor growth. These results directly implicate TrkB in EMT and the invasive behavior of HNSCC, and correlate with the in vivo overexpression of TrkB in human HNSCC. Taken together, these data suggest that the TrkB receptor may be a critical component in the multi-step tumor progression of HNSCC, and may be an attractive target for much needed new therapies for this disease."

In some cases, these different PS are produced by the same bacterium (1.Cerning J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 7: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2.Delcour J. Ferain T. Deghorain M. Palumbo E. Hols P. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, there is a controversy regarding the differences between CPS, WPS, and EPS. CPS may be released into the growth medium as a consequence of handling conditions or because of the instability of the polysaccharide linkage, and consequently, they may be mistaken as EPS. Conversely, certain EPS could be tightly associated to the thick PG layer even in the absence of covalent anchoring (2.Delcour J. Ferain T. Deghorain M. Palumbo E. Hols P. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 3.Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev.

Polysaccharides, often exposed at the outermost layer of bacterial cells, have a wide range of important functions such as adhesion to abiotic surfaces leading to biofilm formation or specific interactions with other microorganisms or with eukaryotic host cells (3.Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 4.Comstock L.E. Kasper D.L. Cell. 2006; 126: 847-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). It was also reported that surface-exposed carbohydrates may serve as bacteriophage receptors (5.Dupont K. Janzen T. Vogensen F.K. Josephsen J. Stuer-Lauridsen B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5825-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The presence of CPS confers resistance to nonspecific host defense mechanisms (3.Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Capsules have been extensively studied as virulence factors of many pathogens, which are able to proliferate in the bloodstream, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B streptococci, or Staphylococcus aureus. CPS present large structural diversity. For example, S. pneumoniae produces a range of different CPS, leading to more than 90 different serotypes (3.Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The significant diversity of PS is determined by their structure, which may differ not only in the nature of sugar monomers composing repeating units, but also in their mode of linkage, branching, and substitution. These polysaccharides can be homo- or heteropolymers substituted by both organic and inorganic molecules (3.Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 4.Comstock L.E. Kasper D.L. Cell. 2006; 126: 847-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis pathways of CPS, WPS, and EPS share several common steps with other cell wall polymers (i.e. PG and teichoic acids), which include the use of undecaprenyl phosphate as lipid carrier and the polymerization of nucleotide sugars, most often containing glucose, galactose, and rhamnose (2.Delcour J. Ferain T. Deghorain M. Palumbo E. Hols P. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The enzymes responsible for CPS, WPS, and EPS synthesis are encoded by large gene clusters that are chromosomally or plasmid located; they often show unidirectional organization and are co-transcribed as single polycistronic mRNAs. These operons contain genes encoding glycosyltransferases together with genes that are responsible for chain polymerization and export (6.van Kranenburg R. Vos H.R. van Swam II, Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6347-6353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These loci are genetically heterogeneous within bacterial species, thus creating a diversity of polysaccharides that affect their function, as for example immune recognition (4.Comstock L.E. Kasper D.L. Cell. 2006; 126: 847-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Ubiquitous and recognized as virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria, CPS are not a common feature of food bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis. Instead, certain L. lactis strains are known to produce EPS that are of industrial importance because they contribute to the texture of fermented dairy products (1.Cerning J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 7: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2.Delcour J. Ferain T. Deghorain M. Palumbo E. Hols P. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 1999; 76: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The plasmid-encoded genes responsible for EPS production in the dairy strains of L. lactis were characterized, and their organization was found to be similar to that of CPS biosynthesis gene clusters of Gram-positive pathogens (6.van Kranenburg R. Vos H.R. van Swam II, Kleerebezem M. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6347-6353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.van Kranenburg R. Marugg J.D. van Swam I.I. Willem N.J. de Vos W.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The presence of chromosomally encoded cell surface-associated polysaccharides was suggested for some lactococcal strains (8.Dabour N. LaPointe G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 7414-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the ability of PS to form an outer layer was never demonstrated in this species. Here, we show that L. lactis MG1363 synthesizes a thin compact outer layer that we named pellicle. This chromosomally encoded pellicle is composed of PS of a novel structure, not previously described for L. lactis and other bacteria. The pellicle protects the bacteria from phagocytosis in vitro. Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. L. lactis was grown at 30 °C in M17 medium (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (GM17). For long-chain mutant selection, overnight cultures were diluted and inoculated into 40-ml flasks of GM17 medium, containing 0.03% of agar (Difco), to produce ∼10–50 colonies per flask and incubated for 12 days. The nonsedimenting mutants were then removed from the top of the colonies and purified by re-streaking to single colonies, and the ability to form chains was observed microscopically.TABLE 1L. lactis strains and plasmids used in this study and their relevant genetic propertiesStrainsRelevant genotypeRef.MG1363Plasmid-free wild type strain48.Gasson M.J.

To map other mutations, a 3175-bp fragment containing llmg_0226 gene was amplified by PCR with Phusion TM DNA Polymerase (Ozyme), using primers 226 (5′-GTTACTTCTTCAGGAGATCC) and 229. The DNA sequence of the obtained fragments was determined by using internal primers. Microscopy images were taken with a phase contrast microscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with an image analysis system Induscam (Andersa). Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously (10.Veiga P. Piquet S. Maisons A. Furlan S. Courtin P. Chapot-Chartier M.P. Kulakauskas S. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). AFM images were obtained in acetate buffer, at room temperature, using a Nanoscope IV Multimode AFM and MCST tips (Veeco Metrology Group). Cells were immobilized by mechanical trapping into porous polycarbonate membranes (Millipore) with a pore size similar to the bacterial cell size. After filtering a concentrated cell suspension, the filter was gently rinsed with the adapted buffer, carefully cut (1 × 1 cm), and attached to a steel sample puck (Veeco Metrology Group) using a small piece of double-face adhesive tape, and the mounted sample was transferred into the AFM liquid cell while avoiding dewetting (11.Dufrêne Y.F. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1132-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 20 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 4.7 (12.Fedtke I.

Cell wall PS were then prepared using a method developed previously (13.Sadovskaya I. Vinogradov E. Li J. Jabbouri S. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Bacteria were suspended in 4% SDS in ammonium acetate buffer and boiled with intensive stirring for 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed six times with ammonium acetate buffer to remove SDS and stirred with 5% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of glass beads for 48 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was dialyzed and freeze-dried. The resulting product was further purified on a Sephadex G-50 column. The major fraction, positive for neutral sugars, amino sugars, and phosphate (average yield ∼12 mg/liter of culture), was used for further chemical analysis and NMR analysis. For the estimation of relative quantities of PS in L. lactis MG1363 and its mutant VES5748, cells were washed with buffer and freeze-dried. Equal amounts (200 mg) of dry WT and mutant cells were treated with SDS and trichloroacetic acid as described above, and after dialysis of trichloroacetic acid, 1 μm inositol was added to each preparation. The lyophilized product was depolymerized with 48% hydrofluoric acid (Acros Organic) for 48 h at 4 °C, hydrolyzed with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h at 110 °C, converted into alditol acetates by conventional methods, and analyzed by gas chromatography. For the preparation of oligosaccharides OS1, OS2, and OS3, PS (20 mg) was treated with 48% hydrofluoric acid (10 °C, 48 h), dried under a stream of air, and reduced with NaBH4. The resulting mixture of oligosaccharides was separated by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography, to give the reduced hexasaccharide OS1 as a major product. Monosaccharides were identified as alditol acetates by gas chromatography on a Shimatzu GC-14 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a Zebron ZB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm), with hydrogen as carrier gas, using the following temperature gradient: 170 °C (3 min) and 260 °C at 5 °C/min. Gel permeation chromatography was carried out on a Sephadex G-50 column (1.6 × 90 cm) and irrigated with water. Fractions (5 ml) were assayed colorimetrically for aldose (14.Dubois M. Gilles K.

High-performance anion-exchange chromatography was performed on a CarboPac PA1 column (9 × 250 mm) with pulsed amperometric detection, with an isocratic flow of 0.1% NaOH. Fractions were collected and analyzed using Dionex system with an analytical CarboPac PA1 column (4 × 250 mm) at 1 ml/min. Products were desalted on a Sephadex G-15 column. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer for samples in D2O at 45 °C with acetone internal reference (δH = 2.23 ppm and δC = 31.5 ppm), using standard pulse sequences DQCOSY, TOCSY (mixing time 120 ms), nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (mixing time 400 ms), and HSQC and HMBC (100-ms long range transfer delay). 1H-31P HMQC and HMQC-TOCSY were run with 1H-31P coupling set to 11 Hz, TOCSY mixing time of 100 ms. Bacteria were grown to stationary phase (16–18 h; 1 × 109 colony-forming unit/ml) in GM17 at 37 °C without shaking. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline solution before resuspension in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) to a final density of 1 × 109 colony-forming units/ml. The murine macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7 and J774 were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin. Infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1 by centrifuging bacteria onto macrophages at 500 × g for 5 min. The plates were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 10% CO2 atmosphere. Macrophages were extensively washed with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated for an additional hour in medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin to kill extracellular bacteria. To monitor L. lactis phagocytosis, macrophages were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in H2O. Serial dilution were immediately plated on M17-Glc agar plates for colony count. For microscopic observation, macrophages cultivated on glass coverslips were infected as described above and extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Monolayers were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with MeOH 100% for 2 min, and colored with May-Grünwald stain (Sigma). Specimens were observed with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200 FCCD camera. To isolate long-chain L. lactis mutants as nonsedimenting derivatives, semi-liquid growth conditions were used (17.Mercier C. Domakova E. Tremblay J. Kulakauskas S. FEMS Microbiol.

Long-chain derivatives of L. lactis MG1363 (Fig. 1A), exemplified here by mutant strains VES5748 and VES5751 (Fig. 1, B and C), were obtained in these conditions. In most cases, lactococci form long chains when cell separation is affected by reduced activity of autolytic enzymes (17.Mercier C. Domakova E. Tremblay J. Kulakauskas S. FEMS Microbiol.

Surprisingly, the activity of the main lactococcal autolysin AcmA was unaffected in more than 100 of such mutants (data not shown), albeit the long-chain phenotype of the acmA mutant allows us to expect the isolation of such mutants in the screen that we used (19.Buist G. Kok J. Leenhouts K.J. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Haandrikman A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After different phenotypical tests, we found that part of these mutants appeared to be resistant to the lactococcal virulent small isometric headed phage sk1, specific to MG1363 (22.Chandry P.S. Moore S.C. Boyce J.D. Davidson B.E. Hillier A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The phage resistance phenotype was due to a phage adsorption defect and not to an inhibition of intracellular development (data not shown). It was previously established that genes important for the adsorption of phages belonging to this group are located within a 24.2-kb chromosomal gene cluster, which is putatively involved in cell wall polysaccharide (PS) biosynthesis in L. lactis strain IL1403 (5.Dupont K. Janzen T. Vogensen F.K. Josephsen J. Stuer-Lauridsen B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5825-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding cluster in one of the mutants, VES5748 (Table 1), and found that it carries a C to T transition in the llmg_0226 gene (gene annotation as in Ref. 9.Wegmann U. O'Connell-Motherway M. Zomer A. Buist G. Shearman C. Canchaya C. Ventura M. Goesmann A. Gasson M.J. Kuipers O.P. van Sinderen D. Kok J. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3256-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), resulting in the appearance of a stop codon. Other long-chain sk1-resistant (sk1-r) mutants carried point mutations or insertions of IS981 in llmg_0226, probably because of the intrachromosomal transposition event. Similar mutants were also isolated based on phage sk1 resistance. In total, 20 sk1-r long-chain derivatives were selected, all of which carried mutations in the gene llmg_0226 (4 point mutations and 16 IS insertions). Although gene cluster, harboring all isolated mutations, putatively encodes cell wall PS (23.Bolotin A. Wincker P. Mauger S. Jaillon O. Malarme K. Weissenbach J. Ehrlich S.D. Sorokin A. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 731-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), this compound was never isolated or characterized. To gain further molecular insights into the PS produced by WT L. lactis MG1363, the carbohydrate-containing polymers of its cell wall were analyzed. The cell wall PS was prepared by trichloroacetic acid extraction, followed by purification by gel filtration chromatography. The purified material was positive in colorimetric reactions for neutral sugars, amino sugars, and phosphate. Monosaccharide analysis revealed the presence of Rha, Glc, Gal, and GlcN in an approximate molar ratio of 0.8:2:1.4:2. NMR analysis of the preparation indicated a homogeneous phosphate-containing PS. To elucidate its detailed chemical structure, the 1H and 13C spectra of the PS were fully assigned using two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear correlation techniques (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). The structure of the PS is schematically shown in Fig. 3. The PS is composed of the hexasaccharide repeating units, containing two Glc (A and C), two GlcNAc (E and F), one Rha (D), and one Galf (B) residues, linked via a phosphodiester bond (Table 2 and Fig. 2A and Fig. 3). To confirm this structure, the PS was depolymerized with hydrofluoric acid and reduced, and the generated oligosaccharide fragments were purified by preparative high-performance anion-exchange chromatography and analyzed by two-dimensional NMR. One main product, the hexasaccharide OS1, was formed by cleavage of the phosphodiester bonds; two other oligosaccharides were produced by additional cleavage of galactofuranosyl (OS2) or rhamnosyl (OS3) linkages (Fig. 3). 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all oligosaccharides were fully assigned (Table 2; Fig. 2B, and data not shown). Altogether, our data unambiguously establish the structure of the PS of L. lactis MG1363 as presented in Fig. 3.TABLE 21H and 13C chemical shifts of WPS of L. lactis MG1363 and the hexosaccharide OS1Unit123456a/bα-Glc A, PS1H5.523.593.773.573.973.80/3.9813C96.272.373.570.172.467.0β-Galf B, PS1H5.154.254.094.003.783.66/3.7213C107.389.576.683.571.563.7α-Glc C, PS1H5.003.573.773.443.743.78/3.8813C99.072.474.070.572.861.5α-Rha D, PS1H4.904.063.763.503.981.2513C101.970.681.871.469.917.5β-GlcNAc E, PS1H4.823.793.713.703.703.84/4.0213C100.856.382.369.275.466.5β-GlcNAc F, PS1H4.663.773.603.603.574.20/4.2013C103.456.674.370.175.465.3Glc-ol A, OS11H3.61/3.723.843.843.703.903.65/3.9613C63.173.970.672.170.870.1β-Galf B, OS11H5.154.254.103.993.773.65/3.7013C107.489.576.783.871.763.7α-Glc C, OS11H4.993.573.763.433.743.77/3.8813C99.172.574.170.572.961.6α-Rha D, OS11H4.874.023.773.483.991.2413C102.171.481.371.770.117.5β-GlcNAc E, OS11H4.783.853.653.693.693.81/4.0213C100.856.482.569.175.566.5β-GlcNAc F, OS11H4.663.753.573.503.453.81/3.9313C103.956.874.770.576.661.4 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Structure of L. lactis MG1363 PS and the oligosaccharide products of its partial hydrolysis (OS1 to OS3).

The relative quantities of Glc and GlcNAc, which are characteristic for the PS of L. lactis MG1363, were measured using gas chromatography analysis with inositol as internal standard. We found that the VES5748 mutant contained about 20-fold less Glc per mg of dry cells than MG1363, and no detectable GlcNAc. We therefore conclude that the VES5748 mutant lacks the PS that is present in the wild type L. lactis MG1363. We chose two long-chain mutants VES5748 and VES5751 (Table 1) for microscopy studies. As observed from TEM micrographs, an outer pellicle is present in WT L. lactis MG1363 (Fig. 1D), which is absent in the two long-chain mutants (Fig. 1, E and F). This pellicle is clearly visible around the cells and intercalated between the peptidoglycan of two dividing cells (Fig. 1D). We therefore conclude that WT lactococci contain an outer layer made of PS. Because TEM micrographs could be biased by the fixation and staining procedures, the presence of the polysaccharide pellicle was examined by live cell AFM imaging (24.Dufrêne Y.F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a microscopy technique that was reportedly used for EPS and CPS visualization (25.Francius G. Lebeer S. Alsteens D.

Dutcher J.R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 5457-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For this purpose, living bacterial cells were immobilized in porous membranes for noninvasive imaging. Fig. 4 shows AFM deflection images of single L. lactis NZ3900 (WT) and VES5748 mutant cells. The surface of WT cells showed well defined division septum and ring-like structures presumably reflecting “equatorial rings” of newly synthesized PG (27.Morlot C. Zapun A. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Besides these structures, the cell surface was featureless and very smooth, the root mean square roughness (Rr.m.s.) on 200 × 200 nm height images being 0.6 ± 0.1 nm. By contrast, mutant VES5748 exhibited a much rougher surface, with an Rr.m.s. of 2.9 ± 0.7 nm. The rough surface may reflect another cell wall constituent, such as peptidoglycan, lying underneath the pellicle. The increased surface roughness in PS-negative mutants correlates with TEM observations revealing that mutations lead to the disappearance of an outer layer. The CPS of Gram-positive pathogens play important roles during bacterial infection and survival in the blood stream and thus affect their virulence (3.Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In these bacteria, the presence of a capsule is often associated with antiphagocytic properties (28.Areschoug T. Gordon S. Contrib. Microbiol. 2008; 15: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the outer PS pellicle of L. lactis MG1363 could display a similar property. A murine macrophage phagocytosis assay, which is routinely used for pathogenic bacteria, was thus performed using lactococcal cells (29.Chen P.M. Chen H.C. Ho C.T. Jung C.J. Lien H.T. Chen J.Y. Chia J.S. Microbes Infect. 2008; 10: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30.Segura M. Gottschalk M. Olivier M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5322-5330Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The obtained results showed that PS-negative bacteria (strain VES5748) are more efficiently trapped inside the murine phagocyte lines RAW 264.7 and J774 than the WT strain (Fig. 5). The yield of internalized mutant bacteria was about 10-fold higher than that of WT, indicating a capacity of the lactococcal PS pellicle (PSP) to provide antiphagocytic properties (Fig. 5). Analysis of phagocyte micrographs confirmed the increased susceptibility of the PS-negative mutant to phagocytosis by showing large clusters of bacteria accumulating inside macrophages, whereas WT bacteria were essentially located at the macrophage surface (Fig. 5, A and B). Similar results were obtained using different bacteria/macrophage ratios (data not shown). These results indicate that the PSP can protect L. lactis against host phagocytosis by macrophages and in this way plays, at least in vitro, a role similar to CPS of pathogenic bacteria. In this work, we identified a cell wall PS produced by the food bacterium L. lactis that forms a compact pellicle located on the outer surface of the cell. Isolation of long-chain mutants and their examination by complementary microscopy techniques (TEM and AFM) allowed us to unambiguously demonstrate the existence of this outer PSP. To the best of our knowledge, this compact pellicle-like layer was never studied in detail in L. lactis nor in other Gram-positive bacteria. The absence of a “traditional” capsule, which could hide or replace the PSP, turned L. lactis into a particularly suitable model organism to reveal and characterize this novel cell envelope structure. Noteworthy, a similar outer layer could be observed in a number of TEM micrographs of L. lactis isolates of different"

Although high-throughput epistasis data from model organisms are being generated and used to construct genetic networks, the extent to which genetic epistasis reflects biologically meaningful interactions remains unclear. We have addressed this question through in silico mapping of positive and negative epistatic interactions amongst biochemical reactions within the metabolic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using flux balance analysis. We found that negative epistasis occurs mainly between nonessential reactions with overlapping functions, whereas positive epistasis usually involves essential reactions, is highly abundant and, unexpectedly, often occurs between reactions without overlapping functions. We offer mechanistic explanations of these findings and experimentally validate them for 61 S. cerevisiae gene pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2088819616,"One strategy to improve therapies in advanced prostate cancer (PC) involves targeting genes that are activated by androgen withdrawal to delay the emergence of the androgen-independent (AI) phenotype. Heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) expression becomes highly upregulated in PC cells after androgen withdrawal or chemotherapy, in which it functions as a cytoprotective chaperone to confer broad-spectrum treatment resistance. The purpose of this study is to elucidate anti-apoptotic pathways regulated by Hsp27 that are activated during PC progression. Using two-hybrid experiment, we found that Hsp27 was having a major role in the protein translational initiation process. Furthermore, using complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis, 4E binding protein 1 was identified as being proportionately and highly regulated by Hsp27. These data led us to analyze the protein synthesis initiation pathway, which is a prerequisite for cell growth and proliferation. Using northern and western blot analysis, we found that Hsp27 downregulation decreased eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) expression at the protein, but not mRNA, level. The cytoprotection afforded by Hsp27 overexpression was attenuated by eIF4E knockdown using specific eIF4E short interfering RNA (siRNA). Co-immunoprecipitation and co-immunofluorescence confirmed that Hsp27 colocalizes and interacts directly with eIF4E. Hsp27-eIF4E interaction decreases eIF4E ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. By chaperoning eIF4E, Hsp27 seems to protect the protein synthesis initiation process to enhance cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Forced overexpression of eIF4E induces resistance to androgen-withdrawal and paclitaxel treatment in the prostate LNCaP cells in vitro. These findings identify Hsp27 as a modulator of eIF4E and establish a potential mechanism for the eIF4E-regulated apoptosis after androgen ablation and chemotherapy. Targeting Hsp27-eIF4E interaction may serve as a therapeutic target in advanced PC."
https://openalex.org/W2143324852,"Cyclotides are a family of macrocyclic peptides that combine the unique features of a head-to-tail cyclic backbone and a cystine knot motif, the combination of which imparts them with extraordinary stability. The prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 is toxic against two economically important gastrointestinal nematode parasites of sheep, Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis. A lysine scan was conducted to examine the effect of the incorporation of positive charges into the kalata B1 cyclotide framework. Each of the non-cysteine residues in this 29-amino acid peptide was successively substituted with lysine, and the nematocidal and hemolytic activities of the suite of mutants were determined. Substitution of 11 residues within kalata B1 decreased the nematocidal activity dramatically. On the other hand, six other residues that are clustered on the surface of kalata B1 were tolerant to Lys substitution, and indeed the introduction of positively charged residues into this region increased nematocidal activity. This activity was increased further in double and triple lysine mutants, with a maximal increase (relative to the native kalata B1) of 13-fold obtained with a triple lysine mutant (mutated at positions Thr-20, Asn-29, and Gly-1). Hemolytic activity correlated with the nematocidal activity of all lysine mutants. Our data clearly highlight the residues crucial for nematocidal and hemolytic activity in cyclotides, and demonstrate that the nematocidal activity of cyclotides can be increased by incorporation of basic amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W2018537340,"The concentration of the second messenger cAMP is tightly controlled in cells by the activity of phosphodiesterases. We have previously described how the protein kinase A-anchoring protein mAKAP serves as a scaffold for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA and the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 in cardiac myocytes. PKA and PDE4D3 constitute a negative feedback loop whereby PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D3 attenuate local cAMP levels. We now show that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) associated with mAKAP complexes is responsible for reversing the activation of PDE4D3 by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of PDE4D3 serine residue 54. Mapping studies reveal that a C-terminal mAKAP domain (residues 2085–2319) binds PP2A. Binding to mAKAP is required for PP2A function, such that deletion of the C-terminal domain enhances both base-line and forskolin-stimulated PDE4D3 activity. Interestingly, PP2A holoenzyme associated with mAKAP complexes in the heart contains the PP2A targeting subunit B56δ. Like PDE4D3, B56δ is a PKA substrate, and PKA phosphorylation of mAKAP-bound B56δ enhances phosphatase activity 2-fold in the complex. Accordingly, expression of a B56δ mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA results in increased PDE4D3 phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PP2A associated with mAKAP complexes promotes PDE4D3 dephosphorylation, serving both to inhibit PDE4D3 in unstimulated cells and also to mediate a cAMP-induced positive feedback loop following adenylyl cyclase activation and B56δ phosphorylation.

IntroductioncAMP controls a plethora of processes in virtually every cell type, including gene expression, intermediary metabolism, and ion channel activity. In most cases, cAMP is produced through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorPDE4D3phosphodiesterase 4D3mAKAPmuscle A kinase-anchoring proteinPKAprotein kinase AMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinasePP1protein phosphatase 1PP2Aprotein phosphatase 2APP2Bprotein phosphatase 2BGFPgreen fluorescent proteinVSVvesicular stomatitis virusGSTglutathione S-transferaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidOAokadaic acidFskforskolinCPT-cAMP8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphatePKIprotein kinase inhibitorIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. activation of the stimulatory Gα protein (Gαs), which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. In the heart, a variety of GPCRs promote the production of this small diffusible second messenger. However, a long standing finding is that the cellular response to cAMP signaling varies in the myocyte depending upon the upstream GPCR (1Hayes J.S. Brunton L.L. Mayer S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5113-5119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brunton L.L. Hayes J.S. Mayer S.E. Nature. 1979; 280: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Keely S.L. Res.

This observation has led to the hypothesis that cAMP production in response to the stimulation of individual GPCRs is restricted to discrete subcellular domains, conferring spatiotemporal control of cAMP production as well as response specificity (5Steinberg S.F. Brunton L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 751-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Dodge-Kafka K.L. Langeberg L. Scott J.D. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms that confine cAMP to these microdomains remains of considerable interest.Recent experimentation involving live cell imaging of cardiac myocytes has revealed that type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) are important for the spatiotemporal control of cAMP following β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (7Fischmeister R. Castro L.R. Abi-Gerges A. Rochais F. Jurevicius J. Leroy J. Vandecasteele G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Individual PDE4 isoforms may contribute to the local regulation of cAMP in different cellular compartments. For example, we have shown that the alternatively spliced PDE4 isoform D3 (PDE4D3) is bound by the scaffold protein mAKAP (muscle A kinase-anchoring protein) in cardiac myocytes (8Dodge-Kafka K.L.

As its name implies, mAKAP binds the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA, and PKA binding to mAKAP is required for PDE4D3 phosphorylation. In response to elevated cAMP levels, mAKAP-bound PKA phosphorylates PDE4D3 on serine residues 13 and 54, resulting in 2–3-fold increased PDE4D3 binding to the complex and PDE activity (10Dodge K.L.

Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Elevated cAMP levels will also activate mAKAP-associated Epac1. However, through Rap1, Epac1 inhibits ERK5 activity, preventing PDE4D3 inhibition (9Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). As a result, Epac1, ERK5, and PDE4D3 constitute a second negative feedback loop that will attenuate cAMP levels in the vicinity of mAKAP complexes. Importantly, both of these negative feedback loops intrinsic to the mAKAP signaling complex depend upon the regulation of PDE4D3 activity as the key element controlling local cAMP levels.Although we have described how mAKAP-bound PDE4D3 may be regulated by PKA and ERK5 phosphorylation, the phosphatase(s) involved in PDE4D3 dephosphorylation have remained unknown. We now show that PP2A bound to the mAKAP complex catalyzes the dephosphorylation of PDE4D3 Ser-54, inhibiting the PDE. Although previously thought to be a constitutive, housekeeping enzyme, it has become apparent that PP2A contributes to the regulation of many phosphorylation events. For example, in the cardiac myocyte, PP2A is involved in the modulation of calcium and MAPK signaling (19duBell W.H. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. J. Physiol. 1996; 493: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20duBell W.H. Gigena M.S. Guatimosim S. Long X. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

The current challenge in the study of this phosphatase is to understand its spatiotemporal regulation. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that exists as a heterotrimeric complex consisting of a stable, ubiquitously expressed catalytic (PP2A-C) and scaffolding (PP2A-A) subunit heterodimer and one of 21 known divergent B subunits (22Lechward K. Awotunde O.S. Swiatek W. Muszyñska G. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 23Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). PP2A-B subunits are grouped into three unrelated families termed B (or PR55), B′ (or B56) and B″ (or PR72) and are proposed to regulate both the catalytic activity and the intracellular targeting of the phosphatase (24Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As now revealed, PP2A associated with mAKAP complexes contain B56δ B subunits. Recently published work demonstrates that B56δ is a PKA substrate, and its phosphorylation enhances PP2A catalytic activity (25Ahn J.H. McAvoy T. Rakhilin S.V. Nishi A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we show that phosphorylation of B56δ by mAKAP-bound PKA increases PDE4D3 dephosphorylation. Our results provide the mechanistic details of mAKAP-anchored PP2A regulation of PDE4D3, elucidating further how mAKAP signaling complexes may regulate a discrete intracellular cAMP signaling domain through a set of interlacing positive and negative feedback loops.DISCUSSIONThe results described in this paper define the biochemical mechanism for the dephosphorylation and inactivation of PKA-phosphorylated PDE4D3 bound by the scaffold protein mAKAP. We discovered that a PP2A heterotrimer composed of A, C, and B56δ subunits binds a C-terminal site on mAKAP distinct from the binding sites for other known mAKAP partners (Fig. 3). The association of PP2A with the mAKAP scaffold is of functional significance in two important and novel ways. First, by binding both PP2A and PDE4D3, mAKAP sequesters the phosphatase in close proximity to the PDE, allowing for efficient PDE4D3 dephosphorylation and down-regulation (Fig. 4). Second, by binding both PKA and PP2A, mAKAP promotes cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the PP2A B56δ subunit and induction of PP2A activity (Fig. 6). The relevance of multimolecular signaling complex formation was evident upon expression of mAKAP mutants lacking binding sites for PP2A and PKA.The concept of phosphatase targeting to generate substrate specificity was first proposed in the mid-1980s with the identification of the glycogen particle-associated protein as the first PP1-targeting subunit (34Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E203-E206Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because of this initial observation, several other phosphatase targeting motifs have been determined (24Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). AKAPs represent an important mechanism to link phosphatases with their appropriate substrates, and several AKAPs bind protein phosphatases. We have recently published that mAKAP binds PP2B and that this interaction is important for PP2B-dependent NFATc3 activation in myocytes (14Li J. Negro A. Lopez J. Bauman A.L. Henson E. Dodge-Kafka K. Kapiloff M.S. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2010; 48: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, PP2B binding to mAKAP does not appear to regulate PDE4D3 because inhibition of PP2B did not affect PDE4D3 Ser-54 phosphorylation or PDE activity (Fig. 1). Our data support a unique role for PP2A bound to mAKAP in dephosphorylation of the PDE and, as a result, in the control of local cAMP levels.The overall role of phosphatases in regulating cellular cAMP concentration has yet to be fully explored. In rat adipocytes, PP2A was found to regulate both PDE3B activity and phosphorylation (35Resjo S. Oknianska A. Zolnierowicz S. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to being phosphorylated by PKA on Ser-54, PDE4D3 is phosphorylated on Ser-579 by MAPKs, including by ERK5 present in mAKAP complexes (9Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 18Hoffmann R. Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. Yarwood S.J. Houslay M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Although PP1 does not appear to bind mAKAP (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 3), PP1 may dephosphorylate PDE4D3 Ser-579 in other cellular domains because the addition of purified PP1 to isolated PDE4D3 decreased phosphorylation at this site. Further work will be required to identify the phosphatase(s) responsible for the dephosphorylation of mAKAP-bound PDE4D3 at Ser-579 as well as the second PKA site on PDE4D3, Ser-16 (16Carlisle Michel J.J. Dodge K.L. Wong W. Mayer N.C. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The anchoring hypothesis suggests that AKAPs function to target the actions of PKA toward specific substrates by localizing both proteins to the same signaling complex. In this report, we demonstrate a new target for PKA in the mAKAP complex, the PP2A B56δ subunit. Previous work found that phosphorylation of B56δ stimulated PP2A activity and enhanced dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 (25Ahn J.H. McAvoy T. Rakhilin S.V. Nishi A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2979-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In accordance with our results, stimulation of cardiac myocytes with β-adrenergic receptor agonists increases PP2A activity (36De Arcangelis V. Soto D. Xiang Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 1453-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We propose that the mAKAP scaffold may facilitate this event because the association of the anchoring protein with both PKA and PP2A is important for the cAMP-enhanced increase in phosphatase activity (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Hence, one can imagine a role for mAKAP in the regulation of phosphatase activity in the heart.Based upon our results, we propose a model in which PP2A serves a dual role in regulating cAMP levels near mAKAP signaling complexes (Fig. 8). First, PP2A in mAKAP complexes should maintain PDE4D3 in a dephosphorylated, minimally active state in the absence of GPCR stimulation (Fig. 8A), presumably allowing for a more rapid rise in cAMP levels in response to agonist. Second, following induction of activating cAMP levels by GPCR stimulation, PKA will phosphorylate both PDE4D3 and PP2A (Fig. 8B). In contrast to the negative feedback on cAMP levels mediated by enhanced PDE4D3 phosphorylation, PKA phosphorylation of PP2A opposes PDE4D3 activation. By inhibiting PDE4D3 phosphorylation, PP2A presumably potentiates and prolongs the actions of local cAMP as part of a positive feedback loop. Thus, in conjunction with the potential inhibition of PDE4D3 by mAKAP-bound ERK5 that we have previously described (data not shown) (9Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), the mAKAP signaling complex is poised to finely regulate local cAMP levels both by multiple feedback loops intrinsic to the complex as well as by cross-talk with upstream MAPK signaling pathways. How these multiple signaling pathways that converge on PDE4D3 ultimately regulate the kinetics of cAMP metabolism in myocytes stimulated by different combinations of upstream signals, including, for example, adrenergic and cytokine receptors, will require further investigation. For example, it has been observed that PP2A expression and intracellular localization are altered in heart failure (37Reiken S. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. He Kl K.L. Prieto A. Becker E. Yi Gh G.H. Wang J. Burkhoff D. Marks A.R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 38Ai X. Pogwizd S.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Whether PP2A-mediated positive feedback or PDE4D3-mediated negative feedback predominately controls cAMP levels local to mAKAP complexes may ultimately depend both on the stoichiometry of PP2A binding to mAKAP and the relative rates of PDE4D3 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by PKA and PP2A in disease states.In conclusion, we have discovered a novel mechanism by which the scaffold protein mAKAP maintains dynamic regulation of anchored PDE4D3 activity through the association with PDE4D3, PKA, and PP2A. Each of the three enzymes is likely to play an important role in the temporal control of cAMP concentration in the vicinity of perinuclear mAKAP complex. This intricate regulation of local cAMP by the mAKAP “signalosome” likely represents a broader role for AKAPs and phosphatase in the control of cAMP compartmentation. IntroductioncAMP controls a plethora of processes in virtually every cell type, including gene expression, intermediary metabolism, and ion channel activity. In most cases, cAMP is produced through G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorPDE4D3phosphodiesterase 4D3mAKAPmuscle A kinase-anchoring proteinPKAprotein kinase AMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinasePP1protein phosphatase 1PP2Aprotein phosphatase 2APP2Bprotein phosphatase 2BGFPgreen fluorescent proteinVSVvesicular stomatitis virusGSTglutathione S-transferaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidOAokadaic acidFskforskolinCPT-cAMP8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphatePKIprotein kinase inhibitorIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. activation of the stimulatory Gα protein (Gαs), which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase that catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. In the heart, a variety of GPCRs promote the production of this small diffusible second messenger. However, a long standing finding is that the cellular response to cAMP signaling varies in the myocyte depending upon the upstream GPCR (1Hayes J.S. Brunton L.L. Mayer S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5113-5119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Brunton L.L. Hayes J.S. Mayer S.E. Nature. 1979; 280: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Keely S.L. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1977; 18: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar, 4Keely S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1979; 15: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar). This observation has led to the hypothesis that cAMP production in response to the stimulation of individual GPCRs is restricted to discrete subcellular domains, conferring spatiotemporal control of cAMP production as well as response specificity (5Steinberg S.F. Brunton L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 751-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Dodge-Kafka K.L. Langeberg L. Scott J.D. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms that confine cAMP to these microdomains remains of considerable interest.Recent experimentation involving live cell imaging of cardiac myocytes has revealed that type 4 phosphodiesterases (PDE4) are important for the spatiotemporal control of cAMP following β-adrenergic receptor stimulation (7Fischmeister R. Castro L.R. Abi-Gerges A. Rochais F. Jurevicius J. Leroy J. Vandecasteele G. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 816-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Individual PDE4 isoforms may contribute to the local regulation of cAMP in different cellular compartments. For example, we have shown that the alternatively spliced PDE4 isoform D3 (PDE4D3) is bound by the scaffold protein mAKAP (muscle A kinase-anchoring protein) in cardiac myocytes (8Dodge-Kafka K.L. Kapiloff M.S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 85: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Dodge-Kafka K.L. Soughayer J. Pare G.C. Carlisle Michel J.J. Langeberg L.K. Kapiloff M.S. Scott J.D.

Kapiloff M.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 303: 388-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), PDE4D3-bound mAKAP likely controls perinuclear cAMP levels. Signaling through mAKAP multimolecular signaling complexes has been implicated in the regulation of myocyte hypertrophy and in the regulation of gene expression during hypoxia (9Dodge-Kafka K.L.

As its name implies, mAKAP binds the cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA, and PKA binding to mAKAP is required for PDE4D3 phosphorylation. In response to elevated cAMP levels, mAKAP-bound PKA phosphorylates PDE4D3 on serine residues 13 and 54, resulting in 2–3-fold increased PDE4D3 binding to the complex and PDE activity (10Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 15Sette C. Conti M. J. Biol.

Because increased PDE4D3 activity accelerates cAMP degradation, PKA and PDE4D3 constitute a negative feedback loop that modulates both local cAMP levels and PKA activity (10Dodge K.L. Khouangsathiene S. Kapiloff M.S. Mouton R. Hill E.V. Houslay M.D. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). PDE4D3 bound to mAKAP serves not only as a PDE, but also as an adapter protein, recruiting the MAPKs MEK5 and ERK5 and the cAMP-dependent Rap1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1 to mAKAP complexes (9Dodge-Kafka K.L.

This pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzyme is involved both in the reversible conversion of l- to d-serine and serine catabolism by α,β-elimination of water, thereby regulating d-serine levels. Because d-serine affects NMDAR signaling throughout the brain, serine racemase is a promising target for the treatment of disorders related to NMDAR dysfunction. To provide a molecular basis for rational drug design the x-ray crystal structures of human and rat serine racemase were determined at 1.5- and 2.1-Å resolution, respectively, and in the presence and absence of the orthosteric inhibitor malonate. The structures revealed a fold typical of β-family pyridoxal 5′-phosphate enzymes, with both a large domain and a flexible small domain associated into a symmetric dimer, and indicated a ligand-induced rearrangement of the small domain that organizes the active site for specific turnover of the substrate."

https://openalex.org/W2075559362,"The plant growth-repressing DELLA proteins (DELLAs) are known to represent a convergence point in integration of multiple developmental and environmental signals in planta, one of which is hormone gibberellic acid (GA). Binding of the liganded GA receptor (GID1/GA) to the N-terminal domain of DELLAs is required for GA-induced degradation of DELLAs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thus derepressing plant growth. However, the conformational changes of DELLAs upon binding to GID1/GA, which are the key to understanding the precise mechanism of GID1/GA-mediated degradation of DELLAs, remain unclear. Using biophysical, biochemical, and bioinformatics approaches, we demonstrated for the first time that the unbound N-terminal domains of DELLAs are intrinsically unstructured proteins under physiological conditions. Within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of DELLAs, we have identified several molecular recognition features, sequences known to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to interacting proteins in intrinsically unstructured proteins. In accordance with the molecular recognition feature analyses, we have observed the binding-induced folding of N-terminal domains of DELLAs upon interaction with AtGID1/GA. Our results also indicate that DELLA proteins can be divided into two subgroups in terms of their molecular compactness and their interactions with monoclonal antibodies.

Binding of the liganded GA receptor (GID1/GA) to the N-terminal domain of DELLAs is required for GA-induced degradation of DELLAs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thus derepressing plant growth. However, the conformational changes of DELLAs upon binding to GID1/GA, which are the key to understanding the precise mechanism of GID1/GA-mediated degradation of DELLAs, remain unclear. Using biophysical, biochemical, and bioinformatics approaches, we demonstrated for the first time that the unbound N-terminal domains of DELLAs are intrinsically unstructured proteins under physiological conditions. Within the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of DELLAs, we have identified several molecular recognition features, sequences known to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to interacting proteins in intrinsically unstructured proteins. In accordance with the molecular recognition feature analyses, we have observed the binding-induced folding of N-terminal domains of DELLAs upon interaction with AtGID1/GA. Our results also indicate that DELLA proteins can be divided into two subgroups in terms of their molecular compactness and their interactions with monoclonal antibodies.

Carol P. Richards D.E. King K.E. Cowling R.J. Murphy G.P. Harberd N.P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3194-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes five DELLAs: AtGAI, AtRGA, AtRGL1, AtRGL2, and AtRGL3. Monocot plants, such as rice, wheat, and barley, have each a single DELLA protein, SLR1, RHT1, and SLN1, respectively. The functions of DELLAs in repressing GA responses are highly conserved between dicots and monocots (2Sun T.P. Gubler F. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 55: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). DELLAs have a unique N-terminal domain that is the receiver of GA signal and contains conserved DELLA and VHYNP motifs. DELLAs also have a highly conserved C-terminal domain that includes several conserved motifs. The features of these motifs as well as genetic evidence have led to the proposal that DELLAs are putative transcriptional repressors regulating GA responses (1Peng J. Carol P. Richards D.E.

DELLAs have been demonstrated recently to act as co-repressors or co-activators by interacting with other transcription factors to regulate GA-responsive gene expression (4Feng S. Martinez C.

Other important components of the GA signaling pathway are the rice GA receptor GID1 (6Ueguchi‐Tanaka M. Ashikari M. Nakajima M. Itoh H. Katoh E. Kobayashi M. Chow T.Y. Hsing Y.I. Kitano H. Yamaguchi I. Matsuoka M. Nature. 2005; 437: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and its three homologous genes in A. thaliana (AtGID1a, AtGID1b, and AtGID1c) (7Nakajima M. Shimada A. Takashi Y. Kim Y.C. Park S.H. Ueguchi‐Tanaka M. Suzuki H. Katoh E. Iuchi S. Kobayashi M. Maeda T. Matsuoka M. Yamaguchi I. Plant J. 2006; 46: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Crystal structure has revealed that the bioactive GA3- or GA4-bound AtGID1a provides a binding interface required for specific interactions with the DELLA and VHYNP motifs in the N-terminal domain of AtGAI (8Murase K. Hirano Y. Sun T.P. Hakoshima T. Nature. 2008; 456: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The GA signal modulates plant growth by causing degradation or deactivation of DELLAs, thereby derepressing GA-regulated genes (9Silverstone A.L. Jung H.S. Dill A. Kawaide H. Kamiya Y. Sun T.P. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). An F-box protein, referred to as GID2 (GA INSENSITIVE2) in rice and SLY1 (SLEEPY1) in A. thaliana, binds to the C-terminal domain of DELLAs once they have perceived the GA signal. This GA-dependent interaction confers specificity of the SCFGID2/SLY1 (Skp1/cullin/F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex toward DELLAs, which promotes the addition of a polyubiquitin chain, thereby targeting DELLAs for their subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteasome complex in response to GAs (10McGinnis K.M. Thomas S.G. Soule J.D. Strader L.C. Zale J.M. Sun T.P. Steber C.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). It was shown that the interaction between the C-terminal domain of AtRGA and SLY1 is enhanced by AtGID1/GA3 binding to the N-terminal domain of AtRGA. Hence, a hypothesized conformational change within the DELLA protein may occur during protein interactions (11Griffiths J. Murase K. Rieu I. Zentella R. Zhang Z.L. Powers S.J. Gong F. Phillips A.L. Hedden P. Sun T.P. Thomas S.G. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3399-3414Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). DELLAs are not only the repressors of plant growth in response to GAs but also serve as integrators of signals from other growth-regulatory inputs. Multiple phytohormone and environmental signals regulate plant processes by affecting the GA-dependent degradation of DELLAs (12Achard P. Cheng H. De Grauwe L. Decat J. Schoutteten H. Moritz T.

Biol. 2008; 18: 650-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Global microarray analysis has shown that DELLAs control the expression of many genes during seed germination and floral development, including genes involved in stress and disease responses (14Cao D.

Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 1126-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In recent years, intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs) have been found to carry out a variety of important biological functions under physiological conditions, such as signaling and molecular recognition (16Xie H. Vucetic S. Iakoucheva L.M. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. Obradovic Z. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 1882-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 17Vucetic S. Xie H. Iakoucheva L.M.

Obradovic Z. Uversky V.N. J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 1917-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Bioinformatics studies have predicted that about 23% of 28,564 sequences from the A. thaliana genome are mostly disordered, and more than 50% of eukaryotic proteins and 70% of signaling proteins contain long disordered regions (18Dunker A.K. Obradovic Z. Romero P. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 2000; 11: 161-171PubMed Google Scholar, 19Iakoucheva L.M. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Obradović Z. Dunker A.K. J.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1989-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Most well studied IUPs are involved in molecular recognition during signaling events. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are short fragments within IUPs, which are responsible for molecular recognition. MoRFs undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to their interacting partners (21Dunker A.K. Lawson J.D. Brown C.J. Williams R.M. Romero P. Oh J.S. Oldfield C.J. Campen A.M. Ratliff C.M.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the AtGID1a-AtGAIn complex has shown that the DELLA and VHYNP motifs are ordered in the bound form (8Murase K. Hirano Y. Sun T.P. Hakoshima T. Nature. 2008; 456: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), no data are available for the DELLAs in the unbound (free) form. Thus, there remains a gap in understanding the putative conformational changes that occur during DELLA-GID1 interactions. Using biophysical, biochemical, and bioinformatic analyses, we have observed, from experiments on DELLAs in both unbound and bound form, that unbound N-domains of DELLAs are IUPs under physiological conditions and that the conserved DELLA and VHYNP motifs in the N-domains of DELLAs act as MoRFs in seeding the DELLA-AtGID1 interactions. Our work provides the key insight into the structure of unbound N-domains of DELLAs and the mechanism by which DELLAs bind to liganded GA receptors. The N-domains of DELLA proteins were prepared as described previously (26Sun X. Frearson N. Kirk C. Jones W.T. Harvey D. Rakonjac J. Foster T. Al-Samarrai T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 58: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Recombinant AtGID1a with a C-terminal His tag was prepared using the same protocol. To make a AtGID1a-AtRGL2n complex, the purified maltose-binding protein-fused AtGID1a was incubated with equal molar AtRGL2n in Tris buffer containing 0.1 mm GA3 for 8 h at 4 °C before adding recombinant tobacco etch virus protease (1:100 w/w). The mixture was shaken overnight to cleave maltose-binding protein fusion tag and centrifuged for 15 min at 30,000 × g to remove aggregated uncomplexed AtGID1a. The supernatant was subjected to maltose-binding protein affinity (MBPTrap HP, GE Healthcare), His tag (HiTrap Chelating HP, GE Healthcare), anion exchange (HiTrap DEAE FF, GE Healthcare) and gel filtration (Superdex75 16/60, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. The Tris buffer used for various separations contained 0.1 mm GA3. The purified proteins were analyzed on both 10% native and 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R to monitor protein bands. LAS MC3000 (Fuji) was used to digitize images of protein gels. The inflorescence tissues of A. thaliana ga1–3 mutant (GA-deficient with increased DELLA accumulation) (27Koornneef M. Veen J.H. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1980; 58: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and A. thaliana quadruple-DELLA mutant (QUAD) (lacking GAI, RGA, RGL1, and RGL2) (28Cheng H. Qin L. Lee S. Fu X. Richards D.E. Cao D. Luo D. Harberd N.P. Peng J. Development. 2004; 131: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) were extracted in buffer (1 g of tissue/3 ml; 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 400 mm sodium chloride, 50 μm GA3, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132, and Roche Complete protease inhibitors). Extracts were centrifuged for 30 min at 40,000 × g to sediment the particulate material, and the supernatant was stored on ice. Recombinant N-domains of DELLAs (26Sun X. Frearson N. Kirk C. Jones W.T. Harvey D. Rakonjac J. Foster T. Al-Samarrai T. Protein Expr. Purif. 2008; 58: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were used to immunize BALB/c PN mice. Splenocytes from immunized mice were hybridized to myeloma cell line NS1 using electroporation and cloned by limiting dilution to monoclonality. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were prepared as ascitic tumors and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, followed by immunoaffinity chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corp.). mAb BC9 reacted with all DELLA proteins, whereas mAb AD7 reacted with AtRGL1n, AtRGL2n, and AtRGL3n but not with AtRGAn and AtGAIn and the DELLAs from monocots, such as SLR1n. mAbs AB8, BB7, and AF2 react specifically with AtRGL1n, AtRGL2n, and AtGAIn, respectively, and none of these bind in the vicinity of either the DELLA motif or VHYNP motif. Therefore, mAbs AB8, BB7, and AF2 were used as capture antibodies, and biotin-labeled mAbs BC9 and AD7 were used as detection antibodies in double antibody sandwich immunoassays. Plant extracts (20 μl/lane), recombinant AtRGL2n, and AtGAIn (10 ng) were separated on a 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel, and AtGID1a-AtRGL2n complex (∼12 ng) was separated on both 10% native and 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein gels were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall) overnight. The membrane was blocked with 0.5% I-block (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). Western blotting of the native form of recombinant AtGAIn, AtRGL2n, and DELLA proteins in the A. thaliana ga1–3 mutants was developed by incubation (2 h) with mAb AF2, BB7, AD7, and BC9. Both the native and SDS-denatured forms of the AtGID1a-AtRGL2n complex were developed by incubation (2 h) with mAb BB7 and rabbit polyclonal anti-AtGID1 antibody. The DELLA proteins and AtGID1a-AtRGL2n complex were detected by further incubation (1 h) with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific antibody (Sigma; 1:50,000 dilution) for mAbs or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma; 1:50,000 dilution) for the polyclonal antibody. Proteins were visualized using chemiluminescence reagent ECL Advance (GE Healthcare) and imaged using a LAS MC3000 imager (Fuji). Protein concentration was determined using the Qubit fluorometer as per the instrument manual (Invitrogen). Epitope mapping for mAb BC9 and AD7 was carried out in an ELISA format. Biotinylated peptides covering part of the DELLA motif (DELLAVLGYKVR-biotinylated K) and the VHYNP motif (SVHYNPSDLSNWVESMLSE-biotinylated K) were synthesized with replacement of each of the amino acids of the sequence with a single alanine (Mimotopes). Each biotinylated peptide was incubated (1 h) with streptavidin (10 μl/ml)-coated 96-microwell plates. mAb BC9 and AD7 (10 μg/ml phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) plus 2% bovine serum albumin; 100 μl/well) were incubated (2 h) at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected using peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and o-phenylene diamine substrate (see below). Amino acids that formed part of the epitope for BC9 and AD7 were identified by observing no reaction or reduced reaction with the alanine-substituted peptides. All ELISA assays were carried out at 37 °C. The immunoassay plates were washed six times with wash buffer (PBST, 50 μm GA3, 20 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma), and Roche Complete protease inhibitors) between the additions of reagents. Reagent buffer was 2% bovine serum albumin in wash buffer. The peroxidase substrate used was phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing o-phenylene diamine (40 mg) and 30% hydrogen peroxide (40 μl) per 100 ml. Peroxidase activity was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 4 m sulfuric acid. Wells of 96-well immunoplates (Nunc; Maxisorb) were incubated (3 h) with AtRGL1n-specific mAb AB8, AtRGL2n-specific mAb BB7, and AtGAIn-specific mAb AF2 (30 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline; 100 μl/well) and were further blocked by incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Serial dilutions of the recombinant N-domain of DELLAs in either extraction buffer or QUAD extracts (containing AtGID1 receptors) were incubated (1 h) on ice before addition to the wells. The recombinant N-domains of DELLAs, captured by their specific mAbs, were further developed by the addition of either biotinylated mAb BC9 or AD7 and detected by the addition of peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences) and the addition of the substrate. A rabbit polyclonal anti-AtGID1 antibody (1:5000 dilution) was used to verify that the AtGID1 receptors complexed with recombinant N-domains of DELLAs had been captured by their specific mAbs. The rabbit anti-AtGID1 antibody was detected by incubation with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) followed by the addition of peroxidase substrate. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a Dynal 5000 microplate absorption reader. Six natively folded globular proteins (IgG1 (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.3 kDa)) were used as standards to calibrate the Superdex 75-16/60 column. Both calibration and elution of DELLAs and the AtGID1a-AtRGL2n complex were run under the same flow rate (0.2 ml/min) and column buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, containing 0.1 mm GA3 in the case of the AtGID1a-AtRGL2n complex). Theoretical Stokes radii for natively folded standard proteins (RSNF) were calculated from the equation (62Uversky V.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13288-13298Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), log(RSNF) = 0.369 log(MrTheo) − 0.254, where MrTheo represents theoretical molecular weight). The experimentally determined migration rate (1000/Velution) of each standard protein was plotted against theoretical Stokes radius and theoretical molecular weight. These plots were used to determine the experimental Stokes radius (RSD) and apparent molecular weight (MrApp) of DELLAs and the complex. The theoretical Stokes radii of DELLAs and the complex in various folding states were derived from their theoretical molecular weight using the appropriate equations (24Uversky V.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). The CD spectra were obtained using a J-720 spectrometer (Jasco). The spectra of the protein samples were measured in a 0.5-mm cell. The samples in buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) were scanned with 1 nm bandwidth, and the average of 25 scans was recorded. The resultant machine unit θ values (m°) were converted to the mean residue ellipticity [θ] using the formula, [θ] = 0.1 × θ × MRW/P × C, where θ is the machine-assigned m°, MRW is the mean residue weight (protein molecular weight/number of residues), P is path length of the cell, and C is the protein concentration (mg/ml). 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol (TFE; >99.5% NMR grade; Sigma) was used to measure the CD spectra of TFE-induced folding. TFE was added to protein samples to give a final concentration of 10–50% (v/v). CD spectra were recorded over the temperature range 20–80 °C. The α-helical content was estimated using the equation (29Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), percentage of α-helix = (−[θ]222 nm + 3000)/39,000, where [θ]222 nm is the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. 260-μl samples of 0.2 mm AtRGL2n and 0.5 mm AtRGAn in buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% D2O) were used for the NMR data collection. Protein samples were placed into the susceptibility-matched Shigemi NMR tubes (5 mm; Shigemi Inc. (Allison Park, PA)). Both samples were labeled with 13C and 15N. A 15N HSQC and a 1H-13C plane of a CBCA(CO)NH experiment were recorded at 298 K for both proteins on a Bruker Avance 700-MHz spectrometer (Fällanden, Switzerland) equipped with a cryoprobe. For AtRGAn 15N HSQC, 1024 complex points with a sweep width of 11.3 kHz and 200 complex points with a sweep width of 2.8 kHz were recorded in F2 and F1, respectively. For AtRGL2n, the corresponding parameters were 1024 complex points and a sweep width of 11.3 kHz in F1 and 128 complex points and a sweep width of 2.3 kHz in F2. Broadband 15N decoupling was applied during acquisition. The 1H-13C plane of a CBCA(CO)NH experiment was acquired for each sample using 1024 complex points with a sweep width of 8.1 kHz in F2 and 64 complex points with a sweep width of 10.2 kHz in F1. Broadband 13C decoupling was applied during acquisition. Spectra were processed with standard parameters using the Topspin software package (Bruker BioSpin). All chemical shifts were referenced to the residual water peak at 4.765 ppm. DELLA protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW2 with default parameter settings. In addition, manual alignment was applied to the N terminus and poly(S/T) regions. Amino acid compositional analysis was carried out by comparing the average amino acid frequencies between N-domains of DELLAs, the DisPro data base, and an ordered protein data base. The mean net charge 〈R〉 of each DELLA protein was calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the numbers of positively charged and negatively charged amino acid residues divided by the total number of amino acids. The hydrophobicity of each amino acid residue was computed by the Kyte and Doolittle approximation using tools from the EXPASY server, with a window size of 5 and normalization on a scale from 0 to 1. The mean hydrophobicity 〈H〉 is defined as the sum of the normalized hydrophobicities of all residues divided by the total number of residues minus 4. The order/disorder of DELLAs was predicted by the program PONDR (predictor of natural disordered regions) VL-XT (available on the World Wide Web). Access to PONDR® was provided by Molecular Kinetics (Indianapolis, IN). A PONDR-based cumulative distribution function (CDF) curve was plotted from the PONDR scores (20Oldfield C.J. Cheng Y. Cortese M.S. Brown C.J. Uversky V.N. Dunker A.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1989-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), and the CDF charge-hydrophobicity (CH) plot was presented as the distance of a DELLA protein from the order/disorder boundary of CDF plot (x coordinate; negative for disorder) and CH plot (y coordinate; positive for disorder). An α-helix-forming molecular recognition feature predictor (α-MoRFs-II) based on PONDR prediction and a large positive data set (30Oldfield C.J. Cheng Y. Cortese M.S. Romero P. Uversky V.N.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 13468-13477Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) was used to identify potential α-MoRFs. The non-regular secondary structure was predicted using the ROSTLAB server (NORSp) at Columbia University (available on the World Wide Web) with window size of 60 and structure content cut-off of 25%. Secondary structure and solvent accessibility were predicted using the Jpred method (32Cole C. Barber J.D. Barton G.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: W197-W201Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web). To gain insight into the biophysical and biochemical properties of unbound N-domains of DELLAs, we have expressed and purified the N-domains (n) of all five DELLAs of A. thaliana (AtRGL1n, AtRGL2n, AtRGL3n, AtGAIn, and AtRGAn), the N-domain of wheat DELLA protein (RHT1n). The domain structure and sequence alignment of DELLAs together with the conserved motifs and other sequence features are shown in Fig. 1. All of recombinant DELLA proteins expressed in E. coli are soluble, entering a native polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2A). mAbs BC9 and AD7, interacting with the DELLA and VHYNP motifs (the GID1/GA3 binding sites of DELLAs (8Murase K. Hirano Y. Sun T.P. Hakoshima T. Nature. 2008; 456: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar)) respectively, and mAb BB7 have been used for native Western blotting (Fig. 2B). All three different mAbs recognize both DELLAs extracted from the ga1–3 and recombinant AtRGL2n, but no signal was detected with QUAD extract (a negative control), indicating that the conformations of these three epitopes in recombinant N-domains are similar to those of DELLAs extracted from plant (see also FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8 for further evidence).FIGURE 2Native PAGE and Western blotting of DELLA proteins.

The resultant apparent molecular weight (MrApp) and Stokes radii (RSD) of N-domains of the analyzed DELLAs are listed in Table 1. The MrApp of each N-domain of DELLAs is approximately 2–3 times larger than its MrTheo, indicating that these proteins are not compatible with a monomeric, globular protein structure. Rather, such a large value of MrApp can be attributed to an extended conformation with low compactness of the polypeptide chain typical of IUPs (24Uversky V.N. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W2015873237,"S100A7 promotes aggressive features in breast cancer, although regulation of its expression is poorly understood. As S100A7 associates with inflammation in skin and breast tissue, we hypothesized that inflammatory cytokines may regulate S100A7 in breast cancer. We therefore examined the effects of several cytokines, among which oncostatin-M (OSM) and the related cytokine, interleukin (IL)-6, showed the most significant effects on S100A7 expression in breast tumor cells in vitro. Both cytokines consistently induced S100A7 expression in three cell lines (MCF7, T47D and MDA-MB-468) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Induction of S100A7 was inhibited by blockade of STAT3, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and ERK1/2 signaling and small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of S100A7 eliminated the promigratory effects of OSM treatment. S100A7 mRNA levels in a case-control cohort of breast tumors (n=20) were significantly associated with expression of the OSM receptor β (OSMRβ) chain (P=0.0098). This association was confirmed using publicly available microarray data from an independent breast tumor cohort (n=201, P=0.0005) and a correlation between S100A7 and poor patient survival was observed specifically in cases with high OSMRβ expression (HR=2.35; P=0.0396; n=85). We conclude that inflammatory cytokines can regulate S100A7 expression and that S100A7 may mediate some of their effects in breast cancer."

Mutations that impair folding cause neonatal diabetes mellitus. Although the classical structure of insulin is well established, proinsulin is refractory to crystallization. Here, we employ heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to characterize a monomeric analogue. Proinsulin contains a native-like insulin moiety (A- and B-domains); the tethered connecting (C) domain (as probed by {(1)H}-(15)N nuclear Overhauser enhancements) is progressively less ordered. Although the BC junction is flexible, residues near the CA junction exhibit alpha-helical-like features. Relative to canonical alpha-helices, however, segmental (13)C(alpha/beta) chemical shifts are attenuated, suggesting that this junction and contiguous A-chain residues are molten. We propose that flexibility at each C-domain junction facilitates prohormone processing. Studies of protease SPC3 (PC1/3) suggest that C-domain sequences contribute to cleavage site selection. The structure of proinsulin provides a foundation for studies of insulin biosynthesis and its impairment in monogenic forms of diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2099949344,"The controls of human keratin expression in situ remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we have investigated the effects of the neurohormone prolactin (PRL) on keratin expression in a physiologically and clinically relevant test system: organ-cultured normal human hair follicles (HFs). Not only do HFs express a wide range of keratins, but they are also a source and target of PRL. Microarray analysis revealed that PRL differentially regulated a defined subset of keratins and keratin-associated proteins. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry and quantitative PCR confirmed that PRL up-regulated expression of keratins K5 and K14 and the epithelial stem cell-associated keratins K15 and K19 in organ-cultured HFs and/or isolated HF keratinocytes. PRL also up-regulated K15 promoter activity and K15 protein expression in situ, whereas it inhibited K6 and K31 expression. These regulatory effects were reversed by a pure competitive PRL receptor antagonist. Antagonist alone also modulated keratin expression, suggesting that ""tonic stimulation"" by endogenous PRL is required for normal expression levels of selected keratins. Therefore, our study identifies PRL as a major, clinically relevant, novel neuroendocrine regulator of both human keratin expression and human epithelial stem cell biology in situ."
https://openalex.org/W2073122810,"We previously reported that exposure of human airway epithelial cells to oxidative stress increased ceramide generation via specific activation of neutral sphingomyelinase2 (nSMase2). Here we show that nSMase2 is a phosphoprotein exclusively phosphorylated at serine residues. The level of nSMase2 phosphorylation can be modulated by treatment with anisomycin or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), suggesting that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinases Cs are upstream of nSMase2 phosphorylation. Oxidative stress enhances both the activity and phosphorylation of nSMase2. Strikingly, we show here that nSMase2 is bound directly by the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN), which acts as an on/off switch for nSMase2 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. Specifically, CaN is being inhibited/degraded and therefore does not bind nSMase2 under oxidative stress, and a mutant nSMase2 that lacks the CaN binding site exhibits constitutively elevated phosphorylation and increased activity relative to wild type nSMase2. Importantly, the phosphorylation and activity of the mutant no longer responds to oxidative stress, confirming that CaN is the critical link that allows oxidative stress to modulate nSMase2 phosphorylation and function."
https://openalex.org/W2043776462,"Pim-3, a proto-oncogene with serine/threonine kinase activity, was enhanced in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. To address the roles of Pim-3 in HCC development, we prepared transgenic mice that express human Pim-3 selectively in liver. The mice were born at a Mendelian ratio, were fertile and did not exhibit any apparent pathological changes in the liver until 1 year after birth. Pim-3-transgenic mouse-derived hepatocytes exhibited accelerated cell cycle progression. The administration of a potent hepatocarcinogen, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), induced accelerated proliferation of liver cells in Pim-3 transgenic mice in the early phase, compared with that observed for wild-type mice. Treatment with DEN induced lipid droplet accumulation with increased proliferating cell numbers 6 months after the treatment. Eventually, wild-type mice developed HCC with a frequency of 40% until 10 month after the treatment. Lipid accumulation was accelerated in Pim-3 transgenic mice with higher proliferating cell numbers, compared with that observed for wild-type mice. Pim-3 transgenic mice developed HCC with a higher incidence (80%) and a heavier burden, together with enhanced intratumoral CD31-positive vascular areas, compared with that observed for wild-type mice. These observations indicate that Pim-3 alone cannot cause, but can accelerate HCC development when induced by a hepatocarcinogen, such as DEN."
https://openalex.org/W2082285942,"Human neural stem cells derived from the ventral mesencephalon (VM) are powerful research tools and candidates for cell therapies in Parkinson disease. Previous studies with VM dopaminergic neuron (DAn) precursors indicated poor growth potential and unstable phenotypical properties. Using the model cell line hVM1 (human ventral mesencephalic neural stem cell line 1; a new human fetal VM stem cell line), we have found that Bcl-X(L) enhances the generation of DAn from VM human neural stem cells. Mechanistically, Bcl-X(L) not only exerts the expected antiapoptotic effect but also induces proneural (NGN2 and NEUROD1) and dopamine-related transcription factors, resulting in a high yield of DAn with the correct phenotype of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The expression of key genes directly involved in VM/SNpc dopaminergic patterning, differentiation, and maturation (EN1, LMX1B, PITX3, NURR1, VMAT2, GIRK2, and dopamine transporter) is thus enhanced by Bcl-X(L). These effects on neurogenesis occur in parallel to a decrease in glia generation. These in vitro Bcl-X(L) effects are paralleled in vivo, after transplantation in hemiparkinsonian rats, where hVM1-Bcl-X(L) cells survive, integrate, and differentiate into DAn, alleviating behavioral motor asymmetry. Bcl-X(L) then allows for human fetal VM stem cells to stably generate mature SNpc DAn both in vitro and in vivo and is thus proposed as a helpful factor for the development of cell therapies for neurodegenerative conditions, Parkinson disease in particular."
https://openalex.org/W1979891719,"The nucleolus is one of the functional nuclear compartments in which the ribosome biogenesis takes place. Proteomic analysis revealed a large number of nucleolar proteins that are involved in diverse cellular processes, including biogenesis of ribonucleoprotein particles, stress responses, cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Here, we report that in response to transcription repression-induced nucleolar segregation, B23, a nucleolar protein required for rRNA processing, is localized to the cytoplasm and forms a complex with the mRNA-binding proteins hnRNPU and hnRNPA1 in a sequential manner. In addition, RNA Polymerase I, but not RNA Polymerase II inhibition, was found to account for the translocation-dependent assembly of B23/hnRNPU/hnRNPA1. We also showed that interactions among these proteins are regulated by hnRNPU-bound mRNAs such as the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of Bcl-xL mRNA. Ectopically expressed 3′-UTR of Bcl-xL mRNA, which disrupted the interactions among B23, hnRNPU and hnRNPA1, led to enhanced cell apoptosis induced by either actinomycin D treatment or mitotic arrest. Overall, these data highlight a novel function of B23 as a stress sensor in the assembly of B23/hnRNPU/hnRNPA1 complex to promote cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1980077869,"Oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) replicates selectively in most human tumor cells but not in normal cells. The relationship between tumorigenesis and the selective susceptibility of most tumor cells to oncolytic NDV replication is poorly understood. A multistage skin carcinogenesis model derived from non-tumorigenic HaCaT cells was used to systematically investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the oncolytic NDV-sensitivity associated with tumorigenic transformation. No significant differences in interferon signaling were observed between the virus-sensitive tumor cells and the virus-resistant non-tumorigenic parental cells. Oncogenic H-Ras, which had been used for tumorigenic transformation, was shown to be necessary for virus replication but was not sufficient to render cells susceptible to NDV replication. By using an siRNA screening approach to search for virus-sensitizing genes in the tumorigenic cells, we could identify the small GTPase Rac1 as an oncogenic protein that is essential for NDV replication and anchorage-independent growth in tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, Rac1 expression was sufficient to render non-tumorigenic cells susceptible to NDV replication and to oncolytic cytotoxicity. This study establishes Rac1 as a link between tumorigenesis and oncolytic virus sensitivity in the HaCaT multistage skin carcinogenesis model."

https://openalex.org/W2079015277,"The predominantly nuclear heterogenous ribonucleoprotein A18 (hnRNP A18) translocates to the cytosol in response to cellular stress and increases translation by specifically binding to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of several mRNA transcripts and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G. Here, we identified a 51-nucleotide motif that is present 11.49 times more often in the 3'-UTR of hnRNP A18 mRNA targets than in the UniGene data base. This motif was identified by computational analysis of primary sequences and secondary structures of hnRNP A18 mRNA targets against the unaligned sequences. Band shift analyses indicate that the motif is sufficient to confer binding to hnRNP A18. A search of the entire UniGene data base indicates that the hnRNP A18 motif is also present in the 3'-UTR of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) mRNA. Validation of the predicted hnRNP A18 motif is provided by amplification of endogenous ATR transcript on polysomal fractions immunoprecipitated with hnRNP A18. Moreover, overexpression of hnRNP A18 results in increased ATR protein levels and increased phosphorylation of Chk1, a preferred ATR substrate, in response to UV radiation. In addition, our data indicate that inhibition of casein kinase II or GSK3beta significantly reduced hnRNP A18 cytosolic translocation in response to UV radiation. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism for ATR activity. hnRNP A18 could thus become a new target to trigger ATR activity as back-up stress response mechanisms to functionally compensate for absent or defective responders."

Herein, we investigated the impact of sialylation mediated by trans-sialidase, a specific and unique Trypanosoma transglycosylase for sialic acid, on CD8(+) T cell response of mice infected with T. cruzi. Our data demonstrate that T. cruzi uses its trans-sialidase enzyme to resialylate the CD8(+) T cell surface, thereby dampening antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell response that might favor its own persistence in the mammalian host. Binding of the monoclonal antibody S7, which recognizes sialic acid-containing epitopes on the 115-kDa isoform of CD43, was augmented on CD8(+) T cells from ST3Gal-I-deficient infected mice, indicating that CD43 is one sialic acid acceptor for trans-sialidase activity on the CD8(+) T cell surface. The cytotoxic activity of antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells against the immunodominant trans-sialidase synthetic peptide IYNVGQVSI was decreased following active trans-sialidase-mediated resialylation in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the parasite's native trans-sialidase activity during infection strongly decreased CD8(+) T cell sialylation, reverting it to the glycosylation status expected in the absence of parasite manipulation increasing mouse survival. Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that T. cruzi subverts sialylation to attenuate CD8(+) T cell interactions with peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes. CD8(+) T cell resialylation may represent a sophisticated strategy to ensure lifetime host parasitism."
https://openalex.org/W2007254915,"Type II plasmid partition systems utilize ParM NTPases in coordination with a centromere-binding protein called ParR to mediate accurate DNA segregation, a process critical for plasmid retention. The Staphylococcus aureus pSK41 plasmid is a medically important plasmid that confers resistance to multiple antibiotics, disinfectants, and antiseptics. In the first step of partition, the pSK41 ParR binds its DNA centromere to form a superhelical partition complex that recruits ParM, which then mediates plasmid separation. pSK41 ParM is homologous to R1 ParM, a known actin homologue, suggesting that it may also form filaments to drive partition. To gain insight into the partition function of ParM, we examined its ability to form filaments and determined the crystal structure of apoParM to 1.95 A. The structure shows that pSK41 ParM belongs to the actin/Hsp70 superfamily. Unexpectedly, however, pSK41 ParM shows the strongest structural homology to the archaeal actin-like protein Thermoplasma acidophilum Ta0583, rather than its functional homologue, R1 ParM. Consistent with this divergence, we find that regions shown to be involved in R1 ParM filament formation are not important in formation of pSK41 ParM polymers. These data are also consonant with our finding that pSK41 ParM forms 1-start 10/4 helices very different from the 37/17 symmetry of R1 ParM. The polymerization kinetics of pSK41 ParM also differed from that of R1 ParM. These results indicate that type II NTPases utilize different polymeric structures to drive plasmid segregation."

https://openalex.org/W2005052635,"Mutations in PKD1 are the most common cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The protein product of PKD1 (polycystin-1 (PC1)) is a large transmembrane protein with a short intracellular C terminus that interacts with numerous signaling molecules, including Galpha(12). Cyst formation in ADPKD results from numerous cellular defects, including abnormal cilia, changes in polarity, and dysregulated apoptosis and proliferation. Recently, we reported increased apoptosis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells through Galpha(12) stimulation of JNK and degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Yanamadala, V., Negoro, H., Gunaratnam, L., Kong, T., and Denker, B. M. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 24352-24363). Herein, we confirm this pathway in Galpha(12)-silenced MDCK cells and utilize MDCK cell lines harboring either overexpressed or silenced PC1 to demonstrate that PC1 expression levels determine activity of the JNK/Bcl-2 apoptosis pathway. PC1-overexpressing MDCK cells were resistant to thrombin/Galpha(12)-stimulated apoptosis, JNK activation, and Bcl-2 degradation. In contrast, PC1-silenced MDCK cells displayed enhanced thrombin-induced apoptosis, JNK activity, and Bcl-2 degradation. In pulldown experiments, PC1 bound to Galpha(12), but not the related Galpha(13) subunit, and thrombin-stimulated MDCK cells led to increased interaction of Galpha(12) with the PC1 C terminus. In transient transfection assays, a PC1 C-terminal mutant lacking the G protein-binding domain was uncoupled from PC1-inhibited apoptosis. PC1 expression levels may be increased or decreased in ADPKD, and these findings suggest a mechanism in which levels of PC1 expression modulate Galpha(12)/JNK-stimulated apoptosis. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a set point model in which PC1 expression levels regulate specific G protein signaling pathways important to cyst development."

To examine de novo lipoprotein secretion, kidneys from human apoB-transgenic mice were minced and placed in medium with 35S-amino acids. Upon sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of the labeled medium, fractions were analyzed by apoB immunoprecipitation. 35S-Labeled apoB100 was recovered in ∼1.03–1.04 g/ml lipoproteins (i.e. similar to the density of plasma low density lipoproteins).

IntroductionApolipoprotein (apo) 2The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinMTPmicrosomal triglyceride transfer proteinLDLlow density lipoproteinLNAlocked nucleic acid. B is the principal structural protein in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins when secreted from the liver and intestine. The human liver produces the full-length apoB100 protein, whereas the intestine mainly secretes a truncated version of the apoB protein, i.e. apoB48 (1.Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The formation of apoB-containing lipoproteins depends on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which transfers lipids onto the newly synthesized apoB polypeptide during its translation and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (2.Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Formation of apoB-containing lipoproteins provides cells with the capacity to efficiently export triglycerides and other lipids, including cholesterol. For instance, the human intestine packs and secretes ∼70 g/day of fat in apoB-containing chylomicrons. Export of triglycerides in the form of apoB-containing lipoproteins also affects lipid homeostasis in tissues other than liver and intestine. Thus, apoB100-containing particles are made in the placenta, where they might participate in lipid transport between mother and fetus (3.Demmer L.A. Levin M.S. Elovson J. Reuben M.A. Lusis A.J.

Thus, ultrastructural studies demonstrated very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-sized lipoproteins in secretory granulae and suggested that these are secreted to the basolateral lumen of proximal tubule cells (10.Walzem R.L. Hansen R.J. Williams D.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 467S-472SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, slices of chicken kidney were incubated with 35S-labeled amino acids, and secretion of newly formed apoB100 in very low density lipoprotein, LDL, intermediate density lipoprotein, and even high density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins was seen (11.Tarugi P. Ballarini G. Pinotti B. Franchini A. Ottaviani E. Calandra S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the lipoprotein metabolism is markedly different in birds and mammals, indications that the mammalian kidney might also produce apoB-containing lipoproteins came from early studies showing triglyceride transfer activity in microsomal extracts of rat kidney (12.Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys.

These seminal studies have supported the hypothesis that lipid accumulation during acute kidney injury might involve blockade of fatty acid oxidation with deleterious lipid accumulation as one result. Acute renal failure affects as much as 5% of hospitalized patients and is often fatal (18.Michalik L. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Irrespective of the mechanism, proximal tubule lipid accumulation may be important for the tubular damage in the critically ill patients.In this study, we used mice to examine whether the mammalian kidney has the capacity to secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins. Inhibition of lipoprotein formation in vivo was achieved with an apoB-antisense oligonucleotide to test the hypothesis that lipoprotein formation affects triglyceride storage in proximal tubule cells.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the mouse kidney produces apoB-containing lipoproteins and that inhibition of apoB expression increases fasting-induced lipid accumulation in the kidney cortex. We detected newly formed apoB100-containing particles in the supernatant after incubation of minced kidney tissue in the cell culture medium. This result was obtained in two separate experiments where labeled amino acids were incubated ex vivo with minced kidney tissue. Both experiments yielded relatively faint apoB bands, which might reflect that the kidney proximal tubules are notoriously sensitive to ischemic or toxic insults. As such, the results shown in Fig. 2C cannot be used to judge the quantity of lipoproteins secreted from the kidney in vivo. Immunohistochemistry studies suggested that the lipoproteins might be produced by tubular epithelial cells rather than glomerular or vascular cells. However, it should be kept in mind that the apoB staining seen in the proximal tubules might at least to some extent reflect plasma-derived apoB rather than local synthesis. The secreted apoB100-containing particles had a density similar to plasma LDL. We cannot exclude that the kidney actually secretes more buoyant triglyceride-enriched particles and that our observations reflect the effect of residual lipoprotein lipase activity in the minced kidney biopsies. Nevertheless, the density of the apoB100-containing particles was similar to that of lipoproteins secreted by the heart. In the avian kidney, Walzem et al. (10.Walzem R.L. Hansen R.J. Williams D.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 467S-472SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) saw intracellular lipoproteins of varying size along the tubular epithelium, and Tarugi et al. (11.Tarugi P. Ballarini G. Pinotti B. Franchini A. Ottaviani E. Calandra S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) detected secretion of apoB-containing particles from chicken kidney slices that varied from dense high density lipoprotein to buoyant very low density lipoprotein. Thus, Walzem et al. (10.Walzem R.L. Hansen R.J. Williams D.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 467S-472SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the density of the kidney-derived apoB-containing lipoproteins may depend on the lipid availability, which may be higher in the proximal than in the more distal tubule cells of the kidney.Treatment of mice with an apoB-antisense LNA oligonucleotide effectively reduced apoB mRNA expression by ∼90% in the kidney cortex. Although this did not affect the triglyceride stores in the kidney cortex in fed mice (indicating that inhibition of apoB in the kidney is not lipotoxic in itself), the fasting-induced lipid accumulation in the tubular epithelium was augmented by the inhibition of apoB expression. This result supports the idea that apoB-containing lipoproteins can export excess triglycerides from the tubular epithelium when the supplies exceed the utilization in β-oxidation.The apoB-antisense LNA treatment also reduced apoB expression in the liver and consequently decreased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Thus, in addition to inhibiting local lipoprotein formation in the kidney, the apoB-antisense LNA treatment at the same time reduced the availability of plasma triglycerides for peripheral tissues. Indeed, in the heart, where apoB expression was not affected by the apoB-antisense LNA, the lowering of plasma triglycerides was associated with a decrease in cardiac triglyceride stores in fasted mice. Also, the fasting-induced changes in kidney cortex expression of genes involved with lipid metabolism tend to be attenuated by apoB-antisense LNA treatments. Therefore, it is possible that the triglyceride-increasing effect of inhibited local lipoprotein secretion in the kidney at the same time was counteracted by a decreased delivery of plasma triglycerides to the kidney. As such, the present studies may have underestimated the importance of local secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from the kidney.The kidney cortex triglyceride content increased ∼10-fold, whereas kidney cortex cholesterol essentially was unchanged upon overnight fasting of the mice. Interestingly, fasting also induced the kidney cortex expression of genes involved in the intracellular metabolism of fatty acids. The changes in gene expression are similar to those associated with increased delivery of free fatty acids and accumulation of triglycerides in the heart of obese mice (8.Bartels E.D. Nielsen J.M. Hellgren L.I. Ploug T. Nielsen L.B. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, we suspect that the fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation reflects increased delivery of fatty acids to the kidney but cannot exclude that decreased fuel utilization also plays a role. Plasma free fatty acids, which were doubled by fasting, are bound to albumin, which is filtered in the glomeruli and taken up by the tubular epithelium (26.Birn H. Christensen E.I. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 440-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Indeed, Oil-red-O staining showed that the fasting-induced lipid accumulation in the kidney cortex was confined to the tubule cells. Thus, the fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation may reflect increased glomerular filtration and tubular re-uptake of albumin-bound fatty acids. It remains to be explored to what extent the fasting-induced triglyceride accumulation in the kidney also reflects increased uptake of lipoprotein-bound triglycerides. Fatty acids can be delivered to tissues via the blood and by lipoprotein lipase acting on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Whereas fasting decreases the activity of lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue, the lipoprotein lipase activity is increased in cardiac and skeletal muscle in rodents (27.Tan M.H. Sata T. Havel R.J. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 363-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ladu M.J. Kapsas H. Palmer W.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: R953-R959PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Ong J.M. Simsolo R.B. Saghizadeh M. Pauer A. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1542-1551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is unknown how fasting affects lipoprotein lipase activity in the mouse kidney.Why has the kidney maintained a capacity to secrete lipoproteins in evolutionary distant species such as mammals and birds? Birds need large amounts of cholesterol and lipids for yolk production, and the kidney is integrated with avian whole body lipid metabolism (10.Walzem R.L. Hansen R.J. Williams D.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 467S-472SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, however, the kidney contribution to the total plasma lipoprotein pool likely is negligible. Perhaps lipoprotein formation by the kidney epithelium instead helps re-secrete fatty acids and perhaps other essential lipid molecules that are taken up from the pre-urine after filtration in glomeruli. For instance, retinol-binding protein is filtered into the pre-urine from where it is normally taken up and endocytosed by the tubule epithelial cells, thus preventing the loss of retinol in the urine. The endocytosed retinol-binding protein likely is degraded in lysosomes (30.Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB-containing lipoproteins contain retinol and play a role in the transport of newly ingested retinol from the intestine to the liver (30.Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the re-secretion to plasma of retinol or other essential lipid molecules could involve formation of apoB-containing lipoproteins, but further studies are obviously needed to explore this possibility. Secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins could also serve to attenuate triglyceride accumulation as suggested by the present results. Lipid accumulation has detrimental effects on cellular function, e.g. by inducing oxidative stress and promoting apoptosis (31.Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 32.Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). Thus lipotoxicity can induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, decrease contractile function in the heart, and impair insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (33.Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T.

The mechanisms are not completely resolved but may relate to the accumulation of ceramides and increased fluxes of free fatty acids causing oxidative stress (31.Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar, 34.Unger R.H. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the kidney proximal tubular epithelium suffers from excess triglyceride accumulation in association with tubular damage induced, e.g. by reperfusion after ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, and treatment with cisplatin (13.Zager R.A. Johnson A.C. Hanson S.Y. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 30.Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, studies by Portilla et al. (15.Portilla D. Dai G. McClure T. Bates L. Kurten R. Megyesi J. Price P. Li S. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1208-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have mechanistically linked cisplatin-induced kidney damage with a decrease in the fatty acid oxidation. It remains to be explored whether the capacity of the kidney to secrete apoB-containing lipoproteins plays a role in protecting the kidney from deleterious triglyceride accumulation in humans. The lipoprotein secretion capacity from the human liver and heart is affected by a polymorphism in the promoter region of the MTP gene (36.Ledmyr H. McMahon A.D. Ehrenborg E. Nielsen L.B. Neville M. Lithell H. MacFarlane P.W. Packard C.J. Karpe F. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that it may be worthwhile to explore whether the polymorphism affects the risk of tubular affection and acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. IntroductionApolipoprotein (apo) 2The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinMTPmicrosomal triglyceride transfer proteinLDLlow density lipoproteinLNAlocked nucleic acid. B is the principal structural protein in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins when secreted from the liver and intestine. The human liver produces the full-length apoB100 protein, whereas the intestine mainly secretes a truncated version of the apoB protein, i.e. apoB48 (1.Young S.G. Circulation. 1990; 82: 1574-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The formation of apoB-containing lipoproteins depends on microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which transfers lipids onto the newly synthesized apoB polypeptide during its translation and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (2.Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1994; 5: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Formation of apoB-containing lipoproteins provides cells with the capacity to efficiently export triglycerides and other lipids, including cholesterol. For instance, the human intestine packs and secretes ∼70 g/day of fat in apoB-containing chylomicrons. Export of triglycerides in the form of apoB-containing lipoproteins also affects lipid homeostasis in tissues other than liver and intestine. Thus, apoB100-containing particles are made in the placenta, where they might participate in lipid transport between mother and fetus (3.Demmer L.A. Levin M.S. Elovson J. Reuben M.A. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 8102-8106Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 4.Madsen E.M. Lindegaard M.L. Andersen C.B. Damm P. Nielsen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55271-55276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The heart produces apoB100-containing lipoproteins that prevent deleterious lipid accumulation, e.g. as induced by type I diabetes or obesity (5.Borén J. Véniant M.M. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6.Nielsen L.B. Véniant M. Borén J. Raabe M. Wong J.S. Tam C. Flynn L. Vanni-Reyes T. Gunn M.D. Goldberg I.J. Hamilton R.L.

PLoS One. 2009; 4: e5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recent data also suggest a role of apoB in formation of age-related macular degeneration of the eye (9.Fujihara M. Bartels E. Nielsen L.B. Handa J.T. Exp. Eye Res. 2009; 88: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).The chicken kidney proximal tubule cells produce apoB100-containing lipoproteins. Thus, ultrastructural studies demonstrated very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-sized lipoproteins in secretory granulae and suggested that these are secreted to the basolateral lumen of proximal tubule cells (10.Walzem R.L. Hansen R.J. Williams D.L. Hamilton R.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 467S-472SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other studies, slices of chicken kidney were incubated with 35S-labeled amino acids, and secretion of newly formed apoB100 in very low density lipoprotein, LDL, intermediate density lipoprotein, and even high density lipoprotein-like lipoproteins was seen (11.Tarugi P. Ballarini G. Pinotti B. Franchini A. Ottaviani E. Calandra S. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 731-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the lipoprotein metabolism is markedly different in birds and mammals, indications that the mammalian kidney might also produce apoB-containing lipoproteins came from early studies showing triglyceride transfer activity in microsomal extracts of rat kidney (12.Wetterau J.R. Zilversmit D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).Lipid accumulation in the kidney is associated with damage to proximal tubule cells, e.g. following ischemia or rhabdomyolysis (13.Zager R.A. Johnson A.C. Hanson S.Y. Kidney Int. 2005; 67: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, cisplatin-induced tubular damage involves free fatty acid and triglyceride accumulation in the proximal tubules (14.Portilla D. Li S. Nagothu K.K. Megyesi J. Kaissling B. Schnackenberg L. Safirstein R.L. Beger R.D. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 2194-2204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cisplatin deactivates the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (15.Portilla D. Dai G. McClure T. Bates L. Kurten R. Megyesi J. Price P. Li S. Kidney Int. 2002; 62: 1208-1218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which controls fatty acid oxidation and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism (16.Fruchart J.C.

Interestingly, deleterious effects of cisplatin and ischemia-reperfusion were alleviated by treating mice with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α agonists (14.Portilla D. Li S. Nagothu K.K.

Ginkgolide X also displayed high nanomolar/low micromolar IC50 values at the homomeric α1 and α2 GlyRs, whereas it was inactive at the heteromeric α1β and α2β subtypes at concentrations up to 300 μm. Thus, the functional properties of the compound were significantly different from those of the naturally occurring ginkgolides A, B, C, J, and M but similar to those of picrotoxin. In a mutagenesis study the 6′ M2 residues in the GlyR ion channel were identified as the primary molecular determinant of the selectivity profile of ginkgolide X, and a 6′ M2 ring consisting of five Thr residues was found to be of key importance for its activity at the GABAAR. Conformational analysis and docking of low-energy conformations of the native ginkgolide A and ginkgolide X into a α1 GlyR homology model revealed two distinct putative binding sites formed by the 6′ M2 residues together with the 2′ residues and the 10′ and 13′ residues, respectively.

The Cys-loop receptors are homomeric or heteromeric assemblies of five subunits, and the pentameric receptor complex consists of three domains: an extracellular domain composed of the N-terminal domains of the five subunits, a transmembrane domain formed by the M1–M4 α-helices of the five subunits (including an ion channel predominantly formed by the five M2 helices), and an intracellular domain composed primarily of the large second intracellular loops of the five subunits (4.Lynch J.W.

Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 733-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Signal transduction through the Cys-loop receptor is initiated by binding of the agonist to orthosteric sites situated at the interfaces between the N-terminal domains of the subunits, and this elicits a conformation change in the pentameric complex leading to flux of ions through the ion channel. Whereas nAChRs and 5-HT3Rs are excitatory Cys-loop receptors mediating the flux of Na+, K+, and Ca2+, GABAARs and GlyRs are inhibitory anionic channels primarily permeable to Cl− ions (4.Lynch J.W.

To be able to elucidate the composition of the native GABAAR and GlyR populations and delineate the physiological roles governed by specific receptor subtypes, there is a profound need for identification and development of selective ligands targeting one or a subset of subtypes.Ginkgolides, natural products from Ginkgo biloba, are diterpenes with a cage structure constituted by 6 five-membered rings and a tert-butyl group (16.Str⊘mgaard K.

The structures of the five naturally occurring ginkgolides A, B, C, J, and M (collectively referred to as “the native ginkgolides”) vary only when it comes to the number and positions of the hydroxyl groups in the molecules (Fig. 1). The ginkgolides are noncompetitive antagonists of GlyRs and GABAARs (18.Kondratskaya E.L. Betz H. Krishtal O.A. Laube B.

Ginkgolides B, C, and J have exhibited preference for heteromeric over homomeric GlyRs in studies of cloned and native receptors (18.Kondratskaya E.L. Betz H. Krishtal O.A. Laube B.

Thus, the compounds display the opposite pharmacological profile compared with that of another natural product, picrotoxin (an equimolar mixture of picrotoxinin and picrotin) (4.Lynch J.W. Physiol.

In contrast to picrotoxin, however, the native ginkgolides cannot be claimed to be truly selective against some GlyR subtypes over others, as IC50α1/IC50α1β and IC50α2/IC50α2β ratios determined in some studies have been 3–7 and 10–26, respectively, and because other studies have not observed significant differences between their antagonist potencies at different GlyR subtypes (18.Kondratskaya E.L.

The pharmacological properties of the ginkgolides have not been characterized at many recombinant GABAAR subtypes, and thus their selectivity profiles at these receptors are unknown (22.Ivic L.

Both picrotoxin and the native ginkgolides have been shown to form interactions with the 6′ residues in the M2 helices lining the ion channel pore (18.Kondratskaya E.L. Betz H. Krishtal O.A. Laube B.

Furthermore, the 2′ M2 residue, located one helix turn below, has been proposed to be involved in the binding of picrotoxin (25.Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J.

In structure-activity relationship studies of ginkgolide analogs, the GlyR antagonist activity of the ginkgolide has been demonstrated to be very dependent on its rigid structure, and modifications of the hydroxyl groups in the molecule have been found to have detrimental effects on its activity (24.Jensen A.A.

Klessing K. Jaggy H. Seederup E. Squires R.F. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2002; 365: R79Google Scholar). In a previous study, small amounts of ginkgolide X was isolated from considerable amounts of waste products from the production of the G. biloba extract EGb 761 (30.Chatterjee S.S. Klessing K.

In this study we have characterized the functional properties of ginkgolide X at GlyRs and GABAARs and investigated the molecular basis for its activity at these receptors.RESULTSFunctional Characterization of Ginkgolide X at Cys-loop ReceptorsThe functional properties of ginkgolide X were characterized at a wide range of Cys-loop receptors in the FMP Blue assay. Cys-loop receptor signaling has been investigated in this assay in numerous previous studies, including references (26.Jensen A.A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 521: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34.Jensen A.A. Kristiansen U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1789-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 45.Fitch R.W.

In supplemental Fig. S2, sample experimental data from the assay are given for anionic and a cationic Cys-loop receptor, the α2 GlyR, and the 5-HT3AR, respectively.GABAARsSeveral human GABAAR subtypes made up from the ρ1 subunit, from α and β subunits or from α, β, and γ2s subunits were expressed in tsA-201 cells by transient transfection of the respective subunit cDNAs, and the functional properties of GABA and ginkgolide X were determined at these receptors in the FMP Blue assay (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Because transfection of cells with α and β subunits gives rise to functional GABAARs, the incorporation of the γ2s subunit in pentamers formed at the cell surface of cells transfected with α, β, and γ2s subunits was verified in two different ways. First, the receptors formed in these cells were shown to be sensitive to allosteric potentiation by diazepam, which is known to bind to the α/γ interface of the αβγ GABAAR complex (data not shown) (3.Whiting P.J. Drug Discov. Today. 2003; 8: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 6.Sieghart W. Sperk G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 795-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Second, cells transfected with α5, β2, and γ2sT6′F cDNAs form functional receptors insensitive to picrotoxin and ginkgolide X, a characteristic not shared by WT α5β2 nor WT α5β2γ2s receptors (see below). This further suggests that at least the majority of receptors formed at the surface of cells transfected with α, β, and γ2s cDNAs actually do contain the γ2s subunit.TABLE 1Functional properties of ginkgolide X at various Cys-loop receptors in the FMP Blue assayReceptorTransf. ratioAgonist EC50aGlycine, GABA, and serotonin were used as agonists for GlyRs, GABAARs, and 5-HT3AR, respectively.

Ginkgolide X displayed IC50 values in the high nanomolar/low micromolar range at all heteromeric GABAARs, whereas its antagonist potency was significantly lower at the homomeric ρ1 receptor (Fig. 2 and Table 1).GlyRsFor characterization of ginkgolide X at human GlyRs in the FMP Blue assay, 200 μm glycine was used as agonist, corresponding to EC70–EC95 concentrations at the different receptors (Table 1). Ginkgolide X displayed high nanomolar/low micromolar IC50 values as antagonist of the homomeric α1 and α2 GlyRs (Fig. 3 and Table 1). In contrast, the compound was completely inactive at the heteromeric α1β and α2β subtypes at concentrations up to 300 μm (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Thus, ginkgolide X displayed a selectivity profile at GlyRs similar to that of picrotoxin (4.Lynch J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In the FMP Blue assay, picrotoxin displayed IC50 values of 2.9 μm (pIC50 ± S.E.: 5.54 ± 0.04, n = 3) and 2.4 μm (pIC50 ± S.E.: 5.62 ± 0.05, n = 3) at α1 GlyR and α2 GlyR, respectively, and IC50 values of ∼300 μm at the α1β and α2β subtypes (n = 3 for both). Thus, with IC50α1β/IC50α1 and IC50α2β/IC50α2 ratios of >400 and >100, ginkgolide X exhibited an even higher selectivity for homomeric over heteromeric GlyRs than picrotoxin with its IC50α1β/IC50α1 and IC50α2β/IC50α2 ratios of ∼140 and ∼130 (Table 1).FIGURE 3Concentration-inhibition curves of ginkgolide X and picrotoxin at tsA-201 cells transiently transfected with human GlyRs in the FMP Blue assay.

The compound was inactive at these receptors at concentrations up to 300 μm (Table 1).The Molecular Basis for Subtype Selectivity of Ginkgolide X at GlyRsThe 6′ residue in the bottom half of the M2 α-helices forming the ion channel of the GlyR have been shown to be involved in binding of native ginkgolides as well as picrotoxin and its two components picrotin and picrotoxinin (19.Hawthorne R.

The 6′ residue is highly conserved through the Cys-loop receptor family, being a Thr or a Ser residue in almost all subunits (Fig. 4). A notable exception is the β GlyR subunit, which contains a Phe residue in this position (Fig. 4). To investigate the role of this residue for ginkgolide X and picrotoxin inhibition of GlyR signaling, the F6′ residue in the β GlyR subunit (Phe282) was mutated to the corresponding Thr residue in α1 and the reverse T6′F mutation (Thr258 → Phe) was introduced in the α1 subunit, and the activities of the two antagonists at GlyRs incorporating these mutant subunits were characterized in the FMP Blue assay.FIGURE 4Alignment of the amino acid sequences of the M2 regions in selected Cys-loop receptor subunits.

In agreement with a previous study (25.Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), introduction of the F6′T mutation into the β subunit also converted the weak antagonist activity of picrotoxin at the WT α1β to almost the same antagonist activity as it displayed at the WT α1 GlyR (Table 2).TABLE 2Functional properties of ginkgolide X and picrotoxin at WT and mutant GlyRs transiently expressed in tsA-201 cells in the FMP Blue assayReceptorTransfection ratioGlycineGinkgolide XPicrotoxinEC50 (pEC50 ± S.E.)IC50 (pIC50 ± S.E.)IC50 (pIC50 ± S.E.)WT α11α:1 vector99 (4.00 ± 0.03)1.4 (5.84 ± 0.02)3.4 (5.46 ± 0.04)WT α1β1α:3β87 (4.06 ± 0.04)>300 (<3.5)∼300 (∼3.5)6′ M2 residue mutantsα1/α1T6′F1 α:1 αT6′F:2 vector92 (4.04 ± 0.05)>300 (<3.5)>300 (<3.5)α1βF6′T1α:3β88 (4.06 ± 0.04)3.0 (5.52 ± 0.03)11 (4.95 ± 0.05)α1βF6′G1α:3β102 (3.99 ± 0.07)∼100 (∼4.0)∼100 (∼4.0)α1T6′FβF6′T1α:3β110 (3.95 ± 0.05)>300 (<3.5)>300 (<3.5)2′ M2 residue mutantsα1G2′P1α:1 vector210 (3.68 ± 0.06)4.1 (5.39 ± 0.05)1.4 (5.85 ± 0.05)α1βP2′G1α:3β160 (3.80 ± 0.05)∼100 (∼4)∼300 (∼3.5)α1βP2′G/F6′T1α:3β150 (3.82 ± 0.05)3.2 (5.49 ± 0.05)7.2 (5.14 ± 0.05)10′ and 13′ M2 residue mutantsα1T10′S1α:1 vectorNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.,bND, not determined.NDNDα1T13′S1α:1 vectorNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1T10′S/T13′S1α:1 vectorNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1βS10′T1α:3β79 (4.10 ± 0.05)>300 (<3.5)∼300 (∼3.5)α1βS13′T1α:3β91 (4.04 ± 0.05)>300 (<3.5)>300 (<3.5)α1βS10′T/S13′T1α:3β93 (4.03 ± 0.06)>300 (<3.5)∼300 (∼3.5)α1βF6′T/S10′T1α:3β110 (3.98 ± 0.06)2.5 (5.59 ± 0.05)7.3 (5.14 ± 0.07)α1βF6′T/S10′T/S13′T1α:3β110 (3.95 ± 0.05)1.2 (5.92 ± 0.05)5.2 (5.28 ± 0.04)α1T10′Sβ1α:3βNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1T13′Sβ1α:3βNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1T10′S/T13′Sβ1α:3βNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1T10′SβS10′T1α:3βNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1T13′SβS13′T1α:3βNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDα1T10′S/T13′SβS10′T/S13′T1α:3βNDaSignificantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.NDNDa Significantly elevated basal levels of fluorescence were observed compared to WT GlyR expressing cells.b ND, not determined.

https://openalex.org/W2152784063,"Catestatin is a natural peptide of higher organisms including humans, with a wide variety of biological functions involved in catecholamine inhibition, cardiovascular regulation, control of blood pressure, inflammation, and innate immunity. It is derived from the natural processing of chromogranin A, induced in the skin after injury, and produced by chromaffin cells and neutrophils. With neutrophils, the peptide enters the cell by crossing the plasma membrane where it interacts with internal targets to induce calcium influx. Therefore, we investigated the membrane interactions and structure of several catestatin-derived peptides. Whereas fluorescence dye release experiments are indicative of membrane permeabilization, multidimensional solution NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies show that catestatin adopts alpha-helical conformations between Ser-6 and Tyr-12 in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles. Furthermore, proton-decoupled (15)N solid-state NMR spectroscopy of sequences labeled with (15)N and reconstituted into oriented lipid bilayers indicates that this domain is aligned in a strongly tilted to inplanar alignment. Proton-decoupled (31)P NMR spectra of the same samples are indicative of conformational and/or orientational heterogeneity at the level of the lipid bilayer head groups due to the presence of catestatin. The sequence and 3-dimensional structure of catestatin exhibit homologies with penetratin, which is suggestive that they both enter the cells by related mechanisms to target internal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2111916313,"The need remains great for early diagnosis of diseases. The special structure of the eye provides a unique opportunity for noninvasive light-based imaging of fundus vasculature. To detect endothelial injury at the early and reversible stage of adhesion molecule up-regulation, we generated novel imaging agents that target two distinct types of endothelial molecules, a mediator of rolling, P-selectin, and one that mediates firm adhesion, ICAM-1. Interactions of these double-conjugated fluorescent microspheres (MSs) in retinal or choroidal microvasculature were visualized in live animals by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. The new imaging agents showed significantly higher sensitivity for detection of endothelial injury than singly conjugated MSs (rPSGL-1- or alpha-ICAM-1-conjugated), both in terms of rolling (P<0.01) and firm adhesion (P<0.01). The rolling flux of alpha-ICAM-1-conjugated MSs did not differ in EIU animals, whereas double-conjugated MSs showed significantly higher rolling flux (P<0.01), revealing that ICAM-1 in vivo supports rolling, once MS interaction with the endothelium is initiated. Double-conjugated MSs specifically detected firmly adhering leukocytes (P<0.01), allowing in vivo quantification of immune response. Antiinflammatory treatment with dexamethasone led to reduced leukocyte accumulation (P<0.01) as well as MS interaction (P<0.01), which suggests that treatment success and resolution of inflammation is quantitatively reflected with this molecular imaging approach. This work introduces novel imaging agents for noninvasive detection of endothelial injury in vivo. Our approach may be developed further to diagnose human disease at a much earlier stage than currently possible."
https://openalex.org/W1969201427,"The beta-catenin-lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) protein complex is the key mediator of canonical Wnt signaling and initiates target gene transcription upon ligand stimulation. In addition to beta-catenin and LEF themselves, many other proteins have been identified as necessary cofactors. Here we report that the evolutionally conserved splicing factor and transcriptional co-regulator, SKIP/SNW/NcoA62, forms a ternary complex with LEF1 and HDAC1 and mediates the repression of target genes. Loss-of-function studies showed that SKIP is obligatory for Wnt signaling-induced target gene transactivation, suggesting an important role of SKIP in the canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with its involvement in beta-catenin signaling, the C-terminally truncated forms of SKIP are able to stabilize beta-catenin and enhance Wnt signaling. In Xenopus embryos, both overexpression and knockdown of Skip lead to reduced neural crest induction, consistent with down-regulated Wnt signaling in both cases. Our results indicate that SKIP is a novel component of the beta-catenin transcriptional complex."

Substitution of the three acidic residues (Glu(571), Glu(235), and Glu(237)) and Arg(606) resulted in impaired binding of the second ThDP, once the first active center was filled, suggesting a pathway for communication between the two ThDPs. 1) Steady-state kinetic and fluorescence quenching studies revealed that upon E571A, E235A, E237A, and R606A substitutions, ThDP binding in the second active center was affected. 2) Analysis of the kinetics of thiazolium C2 hydrogen/deuterium exchange of enzyme-bound ThDP suggests half-of-the-sites reactivity for the E1 component, with fast (activated site) and slow exchanging sites (dormant site). The E235A and E571A variants gave no evidence for the slow exchanging site, indicating that only one of two active sites is filled with ThDP. 3) Titration of the E235A and E237A variants with methyl acetylphosphonate monitored by circular dichroism suggested that only half of the active sites were filled with a covalent predecarboxylation intermediate analog. 4) Crystal structures of E235A and E571A in complex with ThDP revealed the structural basis for the spectroscopic and kinetic observations and showed that either substitution affects cofactor binding, despite the fact that Glu(235) makes no direct contact with the cofactor. The role of the conserved Glu(571) residue in both catalysis and cofactor orientation is revealed by the combined results for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2168588787,"We investigated the interaction of MR with cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and provide a mechanistic explanation and insights into the cellular relevance. MR → CREB crosstalk was assessed in vascular smooth muscle cells and heterologous expression systems. Experiments were designed in a way that only one variable changed at a time and the respective vehicles served as controls. MR, but not GR, activation (aldosterone or hydrocortisone, IC50, ~0.3 nM) inhibits CREB transcriptional activity induced by stimulation of ß1/2-adrenoceptors and adenylyl cyclase or addition of membrane-permeable cAMP up to 70% within 2 h after addition. The MR DNA-binding domain is not required for this inhibition. cAMP formation is virtually unchanged, whereas MR exerts a robust inhibition of CREB phosphorylation via calcineurin/ PP2B activation without changes in PP2B-Aα or ß expression. In parallel, the PP2B-sensitive NFaT-path-way is activated. The inhibitory crosstalk attenuates CREB-induced glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Overall, transcriptional relevant MR → CREB crosstalk occurs at the level of CREB phosphorylation by enhanced calcineurin activity, enables GRE-independent genomic signaling of MR, and is of potential pathophysiological relevance.—Grossmann, C, Wuttke, M., Ruhs, S., Seiferth, A., Mildenberger, S., Rabe, S., Schwerdt, G., Gekle, M.

https://openalex.org/W2160951381,"The human antiapoptotic bcl-2 gene has been discovered in t(14;18) B-cell leukemias/lymphomas because of its overexpression caused at a transcriptional control level by the bcl-2/IgH fusion gene. We were the first to disclose the post-transcriptional control of bcl-2 expression mediated by interactions of an adenine + uracil (AU)-rich element (ARE) in the 3'-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA with AU-binding proteins (AUBPs). Here, we identify and characterize zeta-crystallin as a new bcl-2 AUBP, whose silencing or overexpression has impact on bcl-2 mRNA stability. An increased Bcl-2 level observed in normal phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T lymphocytes, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) T-cell lines, and T cells of patients with leukemia in comparison with normal non-PHA-activated T lymphocytes was concomitant with an increase in zeta-crystallin level. The specific association of zeta-crystallin with the bcl-2 ARE was significantly enhanced in T cells of patients with ALL, which accounts for the higher stability of bcl-2 mRNA and suggests a possible contribution of zeta-crystallin to bcl-2 overexpression occurring in this leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1967731271,"CDKN1C is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. We previously found that the CDKN1C protein represses E2F1-driven transcription in an apparent negative feedback loop. Herein, we explore the mechanism by which CDKN1C represses transcription. We find that adenoviral-mediated overexpression of CDKN1C leads to a dramatic reduction in phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD). RNA interference studies demonstrate that this activity is not an artifact of CDKN1C overexpression, because endogenous CDKN1C mediates an inhibition of RNA pol II CTD phosphorylation in HeLa cells upon treatment with dexamethasone. Surprisingly, we find that CDKN1C-mediated repression of RNA pol II phosphorylation is E2F1-dependent, suggesting that E2F1 may direct CDKN1C to chromatin. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that CDKN1C is associated with E2F1-regulated promoters in vivo and that this association can dramatically reduce the level of RNA pol II CTD phosphorylation at both Ser-2 and Ser-5 of the C-terminal domain repeat. In addition, we show that CDKN1C interacts with both CDK7 and CDK9 (putative RNA pol II CTD kinases) and that CDKN1C blocks their ability to phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase-CTD fusion protein in vitro. E2F1 and CDKN1C are found to form stable complexes both in vivo and in vitro. Molecular studies demonstrate that the E2F1-CDKN1C interaction is mediated by two E2F domains.

A key G1 target of the CDKs is pRB, the protein product of the RB tumor suppressor gene, which in turn regulates the E2F family of transcription factors. Hypophosphorylated Rb binds to and converts E2F family members from potent activators of transcription to potent repressors (4.Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In normal cells, Rb is phosphorylated by CDKs and then releases E2F family members. Freed E2Fs drive expression of genes essential for cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis. Excessive activation of E2F1 can also drive apoptosis, and thus, E2F1 may serve as an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene depending on context (5.Johnson D.G. Degregori J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the absence of functional Rb the ability of CDK inhibitors to restrain E2F-regulated transcription is greatly diminished. Because of this central role in cell cycle control the CDK inhibitor/CDK/RB/E2F pathway is altered at some point in the vast majority of human cancers (6.Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol.

Because of their central importance the CDKs are tightly regulated enzymes. There are two families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors: the CDKN1 and CDKN2 proteins. The CDKN2 proteins are smaller and directly target the kinase subunits of the cyclin-CDK complexes. They are primarily active against CDK4 with some activity toward CDK6. CDKN2A (p16) is the most well known member of this family. CDKN2A is commonly lost in human cancers, and thus, it is classified as a tumor suppressor gene (8.Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). The second group of CDK inhibitors are the CDKN1 proteins that include CDKN1A (p21, WAF1, and p21CIP1) (9.Harper J.W.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). These proteins recognize the cyclin-CDK complex rather than simply the CDK subunit and generally have a broader activity spectrum. Biochemically the CDKN1 family has been shown to bind and regulate a diverse group of CDKs, including G1- and S-phase CDKs (cyclin E-CDK2, cyclin D2-CDK4, and cyclin A-CDK2), and, to lesser extent, of the mitotic cyclin B-Cdc2 (13.Lee M.H. Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Structurally members of the CDKN1 family share a conserved N-terminal CDK inhibitory domain, whereas the C-terminal domains are highly divergent in structure (13.Lee M.H. Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 14.Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Certain CDKs can also regulate transcription directly independent of their role in cell cycle control. One important target of CDKs 7–9 is the C-terminal heptad repeat domain of RNA polymerase II (pol II) (15.Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2922-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The CDK7-containing CAK complex is a component of the multisubunit transcription factor TFIIH, which phosphorylates the serine 5 of the heptapeptide repeat of RNA pol II large subunit, thus promoting transcription initiation, promoter clearance, and recruitment of the capping enzyme (16.Shiekhattar R.

CDK9 forms a complex with cyclin T, which preferentially phosphorylates Ser-2 of the heptapeptide repeat of RNA pol II large subunit promoting transcription elongation and recruitment of the 3′ RNA processing activities (18.Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The CDK8-cyclin C complex is also known to regulate RNA pol II activity (19.Rickert P. Seghezzi W. Shanahan F. Cho H. Lees E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2631-2640PubMed Google Scholar). This report is primarily concerned with CDKN1C, which we will refer to as, p57, its shorter name, in most of the figures. CDKN1C is maternally expressed, partially paternally imprinted (20.Matsuoka S. Thompson J.S. Edwards M.C. Bartletta J.M. Grundy P. Kalikin L.M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Feinberg A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 3026-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and implicated in sporadic cancers and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a familial disorder characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer (21.Hatada I. Ohashi H. Fukushima Y. Kaneko Y. Inoue M. Komoto Y. Okada A. Ohishi S. Nabetani A. Morisaki H. Nakayama M. Niikawa N. Mukai T. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-produced CDKN1C interacted tightly in IP/Western blots with cyclin A-CDK2, cyclin E-CDK3, and cyclin D2-CDK4, whereas its interaction with cyclin D2-CDK6 was modest and its interaction with cyclin H-CDK7 was not detected (14.Matsuoka S. Edwards M.C. Bai C. Parker S. Zhang P. Baldini A. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has shown that bacterially produced CDKN1C can inhibit the kinase activity of baculovirus-produced cyclin H-CDK7 toward a cyclin A-CDK2 substrate (22.Kaldis P. Russo A.A. Chou H.S. Pavletich N.P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whether CDKN1C can inhibit CDK7 and CDK9 activities toward the pol II CTD is not clear. We recently demonstrated that E2F1 activates transcription of two members of the CDKN1 family CDKN1B (23.Wang C. Hou X. Mohapatra S. Ma Y. Cress W.D. Pledger W.J. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12339-12343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and CDKN1C (24.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Activation of these negative cell cycle regulators appears to represent a negative feedback loop that limits excessive E2F1 activity that would otherwise drive unwanted apoptosis. During the discovery of these negative feedback pathways we happened upon the discovery of several novel interactions. Specifically, we find that CDKN1C binds directly to E2F1 and that this CDKN1C-E2F complex negatively regulates transcription by inhibiting the phosphorylation of the RNA pol II CTD. This discovery represents a novel activity for CDKN1C that may be important in its role as a tumor suppressor. HeLa and MDA-MB-231cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media with 10% fetal bovine serum. H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. All drug treatments were performed as previously described (24.Ma Y. Cress W.D.

FLAG-tagged forms of CDK7 and CDK9 were obtained using the PCR to amplify the cDNA from the purchased expression vectors. EcoRI and EcoRV sites were added to forward and reverse primers, respectively, to facilitate sub-cloning. PCR products were ligated into the p3×FLAG-myc-CMV-26 expression vector (E6401, Sigma).

Transient transfections for protein expression utilized the calcium phosphate method: H1299 cells growing in p100 plates and 10 μg of each CMV expression vector (or empty control to a total of 20 μg). Transfected cells were collected 48 h post transfection and were processed for Western blots and immunoprecipitation assays as described below. A shRNAi vector targeting CDKN1C (TRCN0000039678) was obtained from Open Biosystems and was used as previously described (24.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pools of CDKN1C-deficient cells were created by transecting the CDKN1C shRNAi vector into HeLa cells with subsequent selection for transfected cells using puromycin as previously described (24.Ma Y.

Dr. Haura (Moffitt Cancer Center) provided Ad-GFP, an adenoviral vector expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was used as a negative control. Ad-CDK7 was purchased from Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA, catalog no. 1568). Viruses were propagated in 293T cells and titrated with the Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit (BD Biosciences, 631028). Western blots verified viral expression of cdkn1c, CDK7, and absence of E1A expression (to ensure non-recombination). GST-CTD (29.Morris D.P. Lee J.M. Sterner D.E. Brickey W.J. Greenleaf A.L.

Bacterial expression vectors for GST-Rb 379–928, GST-E2F1–1-147, -1–358, -1–284, and -113–284 have been previously described (30.Cress W.D. Johnson D.G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

GST vectors for E2F1 192–437 and 300–437 are novel constructs generated from previously described mammalian expression vectors (33.Wang C. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Cress W.D. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29902-29909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The E2F expression vectors were cut with BamHI and PmeI (blunt) to excise the insert. The pGEX2T vector was prepared by cutting with EcoRI, which was then filled in with DNA pol I (Klenow fragment) to generate a blunt end, and cut with BamHI. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Gold bacterial cells. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with final concentrations of 5 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5% N-laurylsarcosine. The mixture was sonicated 3 times for 10 s each, mixed with 3% Triton X-100, and then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min (for GST proteins the pellet was discarded). The CDKN1C protein was expressed in bacteria using a novel vector (pET-CDKN1C) created by cutting pCMVCDKN1C (TC127869, Origene Technologies) with SacI and HindIII, and cloning into pET23b. Bacterially expressed CDKN1C was prepared as described for GST proteins, however, CDKN1C was primarily found in inclusion bodies (the pellet of the 13,000 rpm spin), and thus, CDKN1C was solubilized in 8 m urea (also containing 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA) prior to use in immunoprecipitation reactions. Twenty micrograms of crude bacterial lysates was used in immunoprecipitation reactions without purification as described below. Mammalian cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 2% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with protease inhibitors (5 μg/ml each of antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin) and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For each IP, 50 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2003) were incubated with 1 μg of the CDKN1C polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1040) or 1 μg of rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2027) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with the same protein lysis buffer, incubated with 800 μg of protein extract for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed again. Proteins bound to the beads were dissolved in loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. IP and GST bead (G4510, Sigma) pull-down reactions on bacterially expressed proteins were carried out using 20 μg of crude bacterial lysates that were prepared as described above. Cell extracts were prepared from H1299 cells that had been infected by Ad-p57 or not by resuspending cells in modified TGN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cleared supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK7 antibody (BD Pharmingen) or anti-CDK9 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and protein A/G-agarose, the beads were washed with TGN buffer followed by TGN buffer plus 0.5 m LiCl, and two washes with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Finally, the immunoprecipitate was resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 mm ATP and 1 μg of purified GST-CTD substrate. The kinase reaction was conducted at 30 °C for 20 min and stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The phosphorylation of GST-CTD was determined by RNA pol II phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitated CDK7 was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-CDK7 monoclonal antibody. Western blots were performed as previously described (1.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Haura E.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Ma Y. Freeman S.N. Cress W.D. Cancer Biol.

Detection of proteins was accomplished using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Various antibodies used included: a rabbit polyclonal antibody to GST (a kind gift from Dr. Jia Fang, Moffitt Cancer Center), a cyclin A rabbit polyclonal (provided by Dr. Jack Pledger, Moffitt Cancer Center), an E2F1 monoclonal antibody, KH20, that recognizes the E2F1 N terminus (sc-56662, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an E2F1 monoclonal antibody, KH95, that recognizes the E2F1 C terminus (sc-251, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a human CDKN1C polyclonal antibody (sc-1040, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse CDKN1C polyclonal antibody (sc-8298, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an RB monoclonal antibody (OP28, Calbiochem), and an actin monoclonal antibody (A5441, Sigma). A monoclonal antibody recognizing the RNA pol II large subunit regardless of modification was supplied by Covance Research Products (8WG16). Bethyl laboratories provided antibodies against RNA pol II phosphorylated at Ser-2 (A300-654A-1) and Ser-5 (A300-655A-1). RNA protection assays were performed using the Riboquant, a multiprobe template from BD Pharmingen (now discontinued), as previously described (24.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as previously described (34.Gyory I. Wu J. Fejér G. Seto E. Wright K.L. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) with minor adaptations. After viral infection, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at ambient temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and lysed for 5 min on ice in cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml. The nuclei were washed for 10 min in cold salt wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 200 mm NaCl and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and resuspended subsequently in 600 μl of sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors). The chromatin was sheared using a Biorupter XL water bath sonicator to lengths ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. After preclearing the sheared chromatin with preblocked protein A/G beads, equal amounts of chromatin were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies in a buffer containing 0.15% SDS and 0.22% Triton X-100. The immunoprecipitated chromatin was collected on protein A/G beads. From the non-bound material of the rabbit IgG immune precipitation 10% was collected as input sample. The bead-bound chromatin was washed for 5 min each sequentially in low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl 250 buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and twice with TE10:1 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA). DNA was eluted twice with TE10:1 elution buffer containing 1% SDS, the samples were vortexed for 1 min, and then incubated at 65 °C for 15 min and ambient temperature for 5 min. The two elution fractions for each sample were collected from the beads and pooled. Cross-linking was reversed by adding 20 μl 5 m NaCl and incubating the samples for 4 h at 65 °C. To purify the DNA, samples were treated with DNase-free RNase (30 min, 37 °C), followed by proteinase K treatment (1 h at 45 °C in 40 mm Tris, 10 μm EDTA). The DNA was then purified using a Qiagen PCR Purification Kit. The manufacturer's protocol was altered by leaving the PE wash on the column for 5 min before spinning and the 50 μl elution buffer for 2 min. Of each sample, except input, 3 μl was used for real-time PCR. For the input sample 3 μl of a 1:10 dilution was used. Antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were RNA pol II 8WG16 monoclonal antibody (Covance, MMS-126R), phospho RNA pol II Ser-2 (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., A300-654A-1), phospho RNA pol II Ser-5 (Bethyl Laboratories Inc., A300-655A-1), and normal rabbit IgG polyclonal antibody (Millipore, 12-370). Real-time PCR was performed using Bio-Rad iQ SYBR Green Supermix on a MyiQ Single Color Real-time PCR detection system. The following primers were used: E2F3 forward, 5′-gacttggaaactccgactgc-3′; E2F3 reverse, 5′-catctctcgctcctgctct-3′; cylin A2 forward, 5′-cagccttcggacagcctcgc-3′; and cyclin A2 reverse, 5′-caaactggctggggcgggag-3′. Human myoglobin intron primer mix was obtained from Diagenode (catalog no. pp-1006-500). We previously demonstrated that CDKN1C can inhibit E2F1-driven transcription in a feedback loop (24.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism of CDKN1C feedback we examined the effects of adenovirus-mediated CDKN1C expression on the protein and mRNA levels of various E2F-regulated genes (not shown). Surprisingly, we observed dramatic reductions in the total phosphorylation state of the RNA pol II CTD repeat domain following CDKN1C expression. Fig. 1 highlights these results in NCI-H1299 (lung) and MDA-MB-231 (breast) cancer cells. In each case CDKN1C expression leads to a dramatic decrease in the expression of the E2F-regulated transcripts, E2F1 and cyclin A, at both the protein and mRNA levels. More examples of CDKN1C-mediated down-regulation of E2F-regulated transcripts can be seen in previously published work (24.Ma Y. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3532-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CDKN1C expression also resulted in a significant to moderate decreases in the phosphorylation state of both Ser-2 and Ser-5 of the CTD. There was little change in the expression of total RNA pol II or actin in response to CDKN1C expression in either cell line. To determine if the observed effect of CDKN1C expression on CTD phosphorylation was an artifact of overexpression, we turned to a well described model in which endogenous CDKN1C is induced by dexamethasone treatment of HeLa cells (35.Samuelsson M.K. Pazirandeh A. Davani B. Okret S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1C demonstrates that overnight treatment of HeLa cells with dexamethasone results in a dramatic up-regulation of CDKN1C, due to the presence of a glucocorticoid response element in its promoter (35.Samuelsson M.K. Pazirandeh A. Davani B. Okret S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with sustained CDKN1C expression for 48 h. By 48 h CTD-Ser-2 phosphorylation has significantly decreased, showing that CDKN1C can regulate CTD phosphorylation. To determine if the decreased CTD-Ser-2 phosphorylation was dependent upon the up-regulation of CDKN1C, HeLa cells were transfected with an shRNAi expression vector targeting CDKN1C (p57 RNAi), and transfected clones were selected by exposure to puromycin. As expected, pools of puromycin-resistant cells reveal that the RNAi significantly reduced the level of dexamethasone-induced CDKN1C and attenuated the down-regulation of Ser-2 phosphorylation in response to treatment. Observing this activity in HeLa cells, which lacks functional Rb family members due to expression of the E7 viral oncoprotein, also suggests that this CDKN1C activity is not dependent upon its well known ability to regulate Rb phosphorylation. The primary kinases thought to be responsible for the phosphorylation of the pol II CTD are CDK 7 and CDK9 (2.Shapiro G.I. J. Clin. Oncol. 2006; 24: 1770-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 15.Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2922-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Previous work has specifically demonstrated that CDKN1C can coimmunoprecipitate cyclins D1, E, and A as well as CDK2 and CDK4 (13.Lee M.H. Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). To determine if CDKs 7 and 9 might also associate with CDKN1C plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged CDK 7, FLAG-tagged CDK9 and/or CDKN1C were co-transfected into H1299 cells, and extracts were subjected to IP/Western blotting. Fig. 2A reveals that both CDK7 and CDK9 are efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with CDKN1C antibody. The fact that the CDK9 band is much stronger in CDKN1C IPs than the CDK7 band may be explained by its higher expression level revealed by the Western blots at the bottom of Fig. 2 and not necessarily by higher affinity. Identical results were"
https://openalex.org/W1997356506,"A growing body of evidence shows that membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (PtdIns(4,5)P(2), PIP(2)) play an important role in cell signaling. The presence of PIP(2) is fundamentally important for maintaining the functions of a large number of ion channels and transporters, and for other cell processes such as vesicle trafficking, mobility, and endo- and exocytosis. PIP(2) levels in the membrane are dynamically modulated, which is an important signaling mechanism for modulation of PIP(2)-dependent cellular processes. In this study, we describe a novel mechanism of membrane PIP(2) modulation. Membrane depolarization induces an elevation in membrane PIP(2), and subsequently increases functions of PIP(2)-sensitive KCNQ potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Further evidence suggests that the depolarization-induced elevation of membrane PIP(2) occurs through increased activity of PI4 kinase. With increased recognition of the importance of PIP(2) in cell function, the effect of membrane depolarization in PIP(2) metabolism is destined to have important physiological implications."
https://openalex.org/W2014062349,"The production of prion particles in vitro by amplification with or without exogenous seed typically results in infectivity titers less than those associated with PrP(Sc) isolated ex vivo and highlights the potential role of co-factors that can catalyze disease-specific prion protein misfolding in vivo. We used a cell-free conversion assay previously shown to replicate many aspects of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy disease to investigate the cellular location of disease-specific co-factors using fractions derived from gradient centrifugation of a scrapie-susceptible cell line. Fractions from the low density region of the gradient doubled the efficiency of conversion of recombinant PrP. These fractions contain plasma membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, and conversion enhancement can be achieved using PrP(Sc) derived from two different strains of mouse-passaged scrapie as seed. Equivalent fractions from a second scrapie-susceptible cell line also stimulate conversion. We also show that subcellular fractions enhancing disease-specific prion protein conversion prevent in vitro fibrillization of recombinant prion protein, suggesting the existence of separate, competing mechanisms of disease-specific and nonspecific misfolding in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2089483344,"The tumor suppressor protein p53 has a critical role in safeguarding the integrity of the genome. Its functions are well understood but factors responsible for the transcriptional regulation of the p53 gene are almost entirely unknown. The DNA replication-related element (DRE)/DNA replication-related element-binding factor (DREF) transcriptional regulatory system is established as a master key to cell proliferation in Drosophila. DREF binds specifically to DRE sequences in the Drosophila p53 (dmp53) gene promoter as shown using anti-DREF antibodies in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, a rough eye phenotype because of overexpression of DREF in Drosophila eye imaginal disks could be suppressed by half dose reduction of the dmp53 gene. In addition, the level of mRNA of dmp53 was decreased in DREF-knockdown cells and transient expression of the luciferase gene under control of the wild-type dmp53 gene promoter showed strong promoter activity in S2 cells, but this was almost completely abrogated with a DRE-mutated promoter. Requirement of DREs for dmp53 promoter activity was further confirmed by anti-β-galactosidase antibody-staining of various tissues from transgenic flies carrying dmp53 promoter-lacZ fusion genes. These results indicate that DREF is necessary for dmp53 gene promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W2061524805,"γ-Secretase is an enzyme complex that mediates both Notch signaling and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, resulting in the generation of Notch intracellular domain, APP intracellular domain, and the amyloid β peptide (Aβ), the latter playing a central role in Alzheimer disease (AD). By a hitherto undefined mechanism, the activity of γ-secretase gives rise to Aβ peptides of different lengths, where Aβ42 is considered to play a particular role in AD. In this study we have examined the role of the large hydrophilic loop (amino acids 320–374, encoded by exon 10) of presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, for γ-secretase complex formation and activity on Notch and APP processing. Deletion of exon 10 resulted in impaired PS1 endoproteolysis, γ-secretase complex formation, and had a differential effect on Aβ-peptide production. Although the production of Aβ38, Aβ39, and Aβ40 was severely impaired, the effect on Aβ42 was affected to a lesser extent, implying that the production of the AD-related Aβ42 peptide is separate from the production of the Aβ38, Aβ39, and Aβ40 peptides. Interestingly, formation of the intracellular domains of both APP and Notch was intact, implying a differential cleavage activity between the ϵ/S3 and γ sites. The most C-terminal amino acids of the hydrophilic loop were important for regulating APP processing. In summary, the large hydrophilic loop of PS1 appears to differentially regulate the relative production of different Aβ peptides without affecting Notch processing, two parameters of significance when considering γ-secretase as a target for pharmaceutical intervention in AD. γ-Secretase is an enzyme complex that mediates both Notch signaling and β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, resulting in the generation of Notch intracellular domain, APP intracellular domain, and the amyloid β peptide (Aβ), the latter playing a central role in Alzheimer disease (AD).

Many studies have recently pointed out the ratio between these C-terminal variants to be of importance for the formation of plaques.

Although PS1 and PS2 share a high degree of homology and can form γ-secretase complexes that are both active on APP and Notch processing, there are some domains that differ extensively between these two proteins, especially the large cytoplasmic loop between TMD6 and -7 (26.Strömberg K. Hansson E.M. Laudon H. Bergstedt S. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. Lendahl U. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 880-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These loops are 110 amino acids in length in PS1 and 84 amino acids in length in PS2 and share only 16% homology when performing protein blast alignment (www.blast.nvbi.nlm.nih.gov). It has been shown that the PS1 loop binds to β-catenin and N-cadherin, but it has been demonstrated that the β-catenin binding domain is not essential for γ-secretase activity as a PS1 molecule lacking the loop can rescue a PS1 −/− lethal phenotype (27.Xia X. Wang P. Sun X. Soriano S. Shum W.K. Yamaguchi H. Trumbauer M.E. Takashima A. Koo E.H. Zheng H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8760-8765Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, the absence of the large cytoplasmic loop does not influence the increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio caused by PS1 and PS2 FAD mutations (28.Saura C.A. Tomita T. Soriano S. Takahashi M. Leem J.Y. Honda T. Koo E.H. Iwatsubo T. Thinakaran G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17136-17142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Deng et al. (29.Deng Y. Tarassishin L. Kallhoff V. Peethumnongsin E. Wu L. Li Y.M. Zheng H. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3845-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that PS1Δexon 10 knock-in mice, which lacks a big portion of the large cytoplasmic loop, had increased amyloid pathology and impaired γ-secretase activity (assessed by accumulation of APP-CTF and reduced Aβ40 formation), indicating a more pronounced functional role for this large domain. To further probe the functional role of the large cytoplasmic loop in PS1, we have investigated this region systematically in cells devoid of both PS1 and PS2. Full-length PS1wt were cloned into the pcDNA5FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen) on BamH1/Not1 sites. The PS1Δexon 10 construct lacks the amino acids 320–374 (PS1 numbering) and was first created by using PCR with the BGH primer and the Δexon 10 forward primer and the T7 and Δexon 10 reverse primers (supplemental Table S1), respectively. After a second PCR, the two fragments were linked together using the T7 and BGH primers, and the PS1Δexon 10 molecule was cloned into the pcDNAFRT/TO vector on BamH1/Not1 sites. PS1 NTFwt and CTFwt have been described elsewhere (30.Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The PS1 CTF N-terminal truncated constructs were created by in vitro mutagenesis according to the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) using following primers: CTFcasp (start 345), CTF start 355, CTF start 365, and CTF start 375 (see supplemental Table S1). The mutagenesis was performed on CTFwt mentioned above. For CTF start 375 D385A, the same primers were used as for CTF start 375, but the template was CTF D385A, which has also been described elsewhere (30.Laudon H. Mathews P.M. Karlström H. Bergman A. Farmery M.R. Nixon R.A. Winblad B. Gandy S.E. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The CTF molecules were cloned into BamH1/Not1 sites in the pcDNA5FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen). Introduction of the glycosylation acceptor sites on PS1wt and PS1Δexon 10, both in pcDNA5FRT/TO, were performed using the OptC primers (supplemental Table S1) according to the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The APPwt in pcDNA3, used for generating a stable cell line, was cloned into the previously described pENTR2B vector (31.Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Pursglove S.E. Bergman A. Winblad B. Näslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24277-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) on NotI/EcoRV sites and then transferred to the pCAG-IRES-Puro vector using Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). The DNA sequence of all constructs was verified using the BigDye® Terminator Version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The reporter constructs MH100, CMV-β-gal, C99-GVP, and NotchΔE-GVP used in the luciferase-based reporter gene assay have been described previously (32.Taniguchi Y. Karlström H. Lundkvist J. Mizutani T. Otaka A. Vestling M. Bernstein A. Donoviel D. Lendahl U. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4014-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 33.Karlström H. Bergman A.

Blastocyst-derived embryonic stem cells deficient for PS1 and PS2 BD8 cells (34.Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) were cultured in ES medium; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). Flp-In-BD8 cells, established elsewhere (26.Strömberg K. Hansson E.M. Laudon H. Bergstedt S. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. Lendahl U. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 880-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), stably expressing APPwt in pcDNA3.1 (BD8:APP) were generated by transfection after maintenance in media supplemented with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. Clonal picking and characterization of APP expression was preformed to avoid clonal variation. A clone with high APP expression was chosen for further use in these experiments. The same clone were also used for creating cell lines stably expressing the PS1wt- or PS1Δexon 10- pcDNA5-FRT/TO vectors, generated according to the Flp-In protocol (Invitrogen). Briefly, by cotransfecting a vector containing the gene of interest and an Flp recombination target site together with a vector encoding the Flp recombinase, this system targets the gene to a specific genomic site. After transfection, cells were selected by supplementing the medium with hygromycin (750 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. The surviving cells were expanded and further analyzed for their PS1 expression. BD8 cells stably expressing PS1 NTFwt (BD8:NTF) have been previously generated in our laboratory (35.Bergman A. Laudon H. Winblad B. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45564-45572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cDNA constructs were transiently transfected into the BD8, BD8:APP, and BD8:NTF using the Lipofectamine2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies were PS1-NTF (NT-1, a gift from Dr. Paul M. Mathews, Nathan Kline Institute) recognizing the C-terminal loop region of PS1, NCT (N1660, Sigma) raised against C-terminal residues 693–709 of nicastrin, Pen-2 (3981 ProSci, Inc.) raised against residues 1–13 of Pen-2, and Aph-1aL (O2C2, Covance) recognizing the residues 245–265 of Aph-1aL and β-actin (Abcam). Cells were lysed 24–48 h post-transfection in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.65% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein levels were determined by the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein in Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma) were separated using NuPAGE Bis-Tris pre-cast gradient 4–12% gel and MES buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and blocked with 5% dry milk followed by incubation of primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After applying the secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies (1:2000, GE Healthcare) for 1 h in room temperature, the blots were developed with ImmobilonTM Western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Millipore) using Amersham Biosciences HyperfilmTM ECL (GE Healthcare) or the CCD camera LAS-3000 (FUJIFILM Life Science). In the case of quantification, the respective bands were measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out 48 h post-transfection from BD8 cells grown in 10-cm plates. Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and lysed by sonication in 200 μl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% CHAPSO, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The samples were kept on ice, and all incubations were performed at 4 °C. The lysate were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min followed by preclearing of the supernatant by 50 μl/ml lysate with a mixture of protein A and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were then incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:250 overnight with end-over-end rotation. The nicastrin antibody N1660 and the Aph-1aL antibody O2C2 were used as primary antibodies or purified rabbit IgG as a negative control. The following day a mixture of protein A and protein G-Sepharose was added to the samples and incubated for an additional 1 h. Next, the precipitates were washed 3 times with co-immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5% CHAPSO and once in phosphate-buffered saline. Laemmli sample buffer (Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The membranes were then analyzed with the NT1 and 3981 antibodies. To analyze the presence of active γ-secretase complexes, BD8 cells stably expressing PS1wt or PS1Δexon 10 were subjected to GCB pulldown. GCB is composed of the γ-secretase inhibitor L685,458 and a biotin group separated by a long cleavable hydrophilic linker. The GCB pulldown, its structure, and characteristics have been described previously (36.Teranishi, Y., Hur, J. Y., Welander, H., Frånberg, J., Aoki, M., Winblad, B., Frykman, S., Tjernberg, L. O. (2010) J. Cell Mol. Med., in pressGoogle Scholar). Briefly, membrane preparations of the cells were dissolved in 0.5% CHAPSO, and protein levels were determined by the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce) before the GCB pulldown. The specificity of the pulldown was confirmed by the addition of excess amounts of competing non-biotinylated L685,458. The captured γ-secretase components were eluted, subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot, and analyzed with the NT1 antibody. BD8 cells transiently transfected with PS1wt, PS1wt optC, PS1Δexon 10, or PS1Δexon 10 optC in 6-well tissue culture plates were harvested 24 h post-transfection. The endoglycosidase H treatment has been described elsewhere (37.Bergman A. Hansson E.M. Pursglove S.E. Farmery M.R. Lannfelt L. Lendahl U. Lundkvist J. Näslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16744-16753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protein levels were determined by the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce), and next the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot and then analyzed with the NT1 antibody. The endoproteolysis pattern of the PS1Δexon 10 molecule was analyzed from seven membranes by quantifying the intensity of the full-length (FL) and the NTF band of PS1wt and PS1Δexon 10 in the CCD camera. Next, the ratio of NTF/FL was calculated and compared with the ratio for the PS1wt. BD8 cells were transfected using a total amount of 1500 ng of DNA consisting of 300 ng of PS1wt/PS1Δexon 10 or 300 ng of each NTFwt, and truncated CTF, empty pcDNA5 vector was also added to adjust the difference in DNA amounts. Furthermore, 300 ng of MH100, 200 ng of CMV-β-gal, 100 ng of green fluorescent protein, and 300 ng of C99-GVP/NotchΔE-GVP were added. Cells were lysed 36 h post-transfection and then analyzed as previously described (33.Karlström H. Bergman A. Lendahl U. Näslund J. Lundkvist J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6763-6766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To adjust for differences in transfection efficiency, the β-galactosidase activity of the cell lysate was determined. The luciferase activity was also normalized for protein expression using a PS1-NTF antibody (NT-1). Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated 4–5 times. A sandwich immunoassay using the Meso Scale Discovery Sector Imager 6000 was used to quantify secreted Aβ peptides in conditioned medium. All reagents were from Meso Scale Discovery if not stated otherwise. BD8:APP was transfected with 800 ng of PS1wt/PS1Δexon 10 or 800 ng of each NTFwt and truncated CTF, empty pcDNA5 vector was added to adjust for differences in DNA amounts, and 200 ng of CMV-β-gal and 100 ng of green fluorescent protein was added. Next, cells were incubated in 240 μl of fresh ES medium containing either 1 μm L685,458 or vehicle (DMSO) for 36 h before analysis of the conditioned medium. Multi-Array plates precoated with either Triplex C-terminal-specific anti-Aβ40/38/42 antibodies or 6E10 were blocked and washed according to manufacturer's instructions. Media samples and Aβ peptide standards (Meso Scale Discovery and AnaSpec) as well as a ruthenylated 6E10 or C-terminal-specific anti-Aβ42 (SULFO-TAGTM) detection antibodies or primary anti-Aβ40 and anti-Aβ39 antibodies (both from AstraZeneca) were added to the samples before incubation at 4 °C overnight. The next day the 6E10 precoated plates with primary anti-Aβ40 or anti-Aβ39 antibodies were subjected to a secondary ruthenylated anti-rabbit (SULFO-TAGTM) antibody. For total Aβ detection, samples were incubated overnight and then subjected to ruthenylated 4G8 (SULFO-TAGTM) at room temperature for 2 h before all plates were washed. All antibodies were diluted in 1% blocking buffer. For detection, Meso Scale Discovery Read buffer was added, and the light emission at 620 nm was measured after electrochemical stimulation. The corresponding concentrations of Aβ peptides in the samples were calculated using the Aβ peptide standard curves. Next, the β-galactosidase activity of the cell lysate was determined to adjust for differences in transfection efficiency. The secreted Aβ40 peptide was also normalized for protein expression using a PS1-NTF antibody (NT-1). Experiments were performed in triplicate or duplicate and repeated 4–6 times. BD8 and BD8:NTF cells were transfected in 1 well of a 6-well tissue culture plate with 500 ng of CMV-β-gal and 200 ng of green fluorescent protein as well as 2000 ng of PS1wt or PS1Δexon 10 for BD8 cells or 2000 ng of each of CTFwt or CTF start 375 for BD8:NTF. 6 h post-transfection, the cells were divided to 8 wells and incubated for 36 h. Transfected cells were exposed to 50 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 h and then lysed in 200 μl of whole cell extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein levels were determined by the BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein from the cell extracts from the t = 0 time point was analyzed for full-length PS1 and/or PS1 NTF expression by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the NT1 antibody. β-Galactosidase measurements were done as described above to ensure equal transfection efficiency. After quantifying the intensity with the CCD camera, protein levels for the different constructs were correlated to the construct showing the lowest expression, i.e. PS1wt versus PS1Δexon 10 and CTFwt versus the CTF start 375. Proteins from various time points for each construct were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels and analyzed as above. The same blots were also stained with anti-β-actin antibody to ensure for equal amounts of loaded protein. The experiment was repeated three times. All experiments in this paper were performed at least three times in duplicate or triplicate. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test by the STATISTICA 8 software from StatSoft was used for statistical analysis. Although the large hydrophilic loop in PS1 has been suggested to be dispensable for γ-secretase activity (27.Xia X. Wang P. Sun X. Soriano S. Shum W.K. Yamaguchi H. Trumbauer M.E. Takashima A.

To address this we have used cells deficient for PS1 and PS2 (BD8) to nullify the influence from endogenous PS, thereby simplifying interpretation of results. We constructed a cDNA that encodes the human PS1 protein without the loop region (Δ320–374), termed PS1Δexon 10 (Fig. 1A). Because the endoproteolytic site is still present in the construct (Met-292) (38.Steiner H. Romig H. Pesold B. Philipp U. Baader M. Citron M. Loetscher H. Jacobsen H. Haass C.

https://openalex.org/W2114845539,"Hepatic nuclear factor 1alpha (HNF1alpha) is a key regulator of development and function in pancreatic beta cells and is specifically involved in regulation of glycolysis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Abnormal expression of HNF1alpha leads to development of MODY3 (maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3). We report that NK6 homeodomain 1 (NKX6.1) binds to a cis-regulatory element in the HNF1alpha promoter and is a major regulator of this gene in beta cells. We identified an NKX6.1 recognition sequence in the distal region of the HNF1alpha promoter and demonstrated specific binding of NKX6.1 in beta cells by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of the NKX6.1 core-binding sequence eliminated NKX6.1-mediated activation and substantially decreased activity of the HNF1alpha promoter in beta cells. Overexpression or small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the Nkx6.1 gene resulted in increased or diminished HNF1alpha gene expression, respectively, in beta cells. We conclude that NKX6.1 is a novel regulator of HNF1alpha in pancreatic beta cells. This novel regulatory mechanism for HNF1alpha in beta cells may provide new molecular targets for the diagnosis of MODY3."
https://openalex.org/W2158545848,"The present study evaluated the efficacy of intermittent antiviral treatment administered to HIV-infected patients under stepwise reductions in weekly medication. Forty-eight patients were invited to reduce their antiviral medication to 5 consecutive days per week; after control over HIV activity was ascertained, antiviral drugs were cut to 4 consecutive days per week. Of the 48, 39 then reduced medicines further to 3 d, and 12 of those eventually undertook a 2 d/wk schedule. Clinical and immunological status and plasma HIV load were repeatedly monitored. HIV was unremittingly maintained below detection levels in all patients under either 5- or 4-d/wk treatment regimens, for a mean 56 +/- 40 wk/patient (5-d regimen) and 84 +/- 46 wk/patient (4-d regimen). Of the 39 patients under 3-d regimens, 35 maintained optimal control over HIV activity for a mean 50 +/- 32 wk, as did 10 of the 12 under 2-d regimens, for 24 +/- 10.5 wk. Summing up treatment < or = 5 d/wk, plasma HIV remained below detection levels for a cumulative 8895 wk (170 patient-yr). No major HIV-related clinical event was reported. and CD4(+)T-cell counts and percentages readily increased over the last value noted under the 7-d treatment course. Viral failure was documented in 6 of the 48 patients: 4 under a 3-d/wk regimen, 2 under a 2-d/wk regimen. All 6 patients had their treatment swiftly set back to a 7-d/wk regimen, resulting in rapid control over HIV replication. In summary, intermittent antiretroviral regimens optimally suppressed HIV in patients taking antiviral medicines 5 and 4 d/wk, as well as in a substantial proportion of patients under 3- or 2-d/wk antiviral regimens, reducing both expenses and, possibly, drug toxicity. Controlled prospective clinical trials are warranted before considering short weekly cycles of antiretroviral medicines an alternative in the management of chronically HIV-infected patients."
