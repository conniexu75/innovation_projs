https://openalex.org/W2091287282,"THE nature of intramembranous particles has recently been discussed in relation to the mode of freeze fracturing1,2. It has been argued that particles that do not show complementarity (complementary pits on the opposite fracture face) are a reflection of protein penetrating the membrane. The protein giving rise to an intramembraneous particle is plastically deformed during the fracturing procedure and is probably pulled out to one of the two fracture faces. Moreover we have argued that particles showing complementarity (pits) are possibly of lipidic origin. This latter hypothesis was mainly based on the determination of the nature of the intramembranous particles of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. These complementary particles were shown to be determined by lipo-polysaccharide3,4. We show here that lipid can by itself form intramembranous particles showing complementarity and that these particles may be inverted micelles of phospholipid sandwiched between lipid monolayers."

Extensive polymorphism of cell-surface histocompatibility markers is evident. The histocompatibility barriers range from strong to weak depending on the interclonal combination, but early rejection with conspicous cytotoxic sequelae is typical. Reaction times of first-set, second-set, and third-party grafts indicate highly discriminating transplantation immunity with a specific memory component."

The average lengths obtained are muliples of about 10.4 bases, significantly different from the value of 10 previously reported. This periodicity in fragment lengths is closely related to the periodicity of the DNA double helix in chromatin, but the two values need not be exactly the same."

https://openalex.org/W2083625430,"A new flow configuration for flow cytometry has been devised in which a flat, laminar stream of water, containing the stained cells in a narrow sector, is formed on a microscope cover slip by a pressurized jet of water directed onto the glass at low angle. The stream of cells is viewed by means of a fluorescence microscope with incident illumination and a pulse photometer. Coupled to a multichannel pulse height analyzer, the instrument constitutes a stable and easy-to-operate flow cytometer with a resolution equal to or better than a coefficient of variance of 1.4 percent in measurements of cellular DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2020836979,"The effects of thyroxine and propylthiouracil on nerve growth factor concentrations in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem of adult male mice were assessed by using a sensitive radioimmunoassay for the beta-subunit of mouse nerve growth factor. Thyroxine administration significantly increased the concentration of nerve growth factor in all three brain areas compared to control values, whereas propylthiouracil was without effect. These results suggest that thyroid hormones stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis in the mature central nervous system, and raise the possibility that the influence of thyroid hormones on central nervous system development might be mediated or influenced by nerve growth factor."

Separate clusters of cells labeled by retrograde transport were observed in the substantia nigra, while in the dorsal raphe many cells were double-labeled. Thus, single raphe cells send divergent axon collaterals to widespread forebrain areas."

Light chain phosphorylation in the intact muscle had a marked requirement for Ca2+ and was dependent upon the passive tension applied to the muscle. Norepinephrine- or KCl-induced contractures were associated with concomitant increases in light chain phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2022830636,"An immunological method based on labeling an antigen with an electroactive group detectable by differential pulse polarography has been demonstrated. Estriol labeled with mercuric acetate is electroactive, giving a reduction wave at -300 millivolts versus a standard calomel electrode. Addition of estriol antibody to 4-mercuric acetate estriol diminishes the peak current as a result of the antigen-antibody binding reaction. Separation of free-labeled estriol from antibody-bound-labeled antigen is unnecessary. The method is potentially useful as an analytical immunological technique."

The sound energy in their sonar cries is unevenly distributed over the range from about 1 to 15 kilohertz, with a dominant frequency range of 1.5 to 2.5 kilohertz. This corresponds to the most sensitive range of their hearing as determined by neurophysiological methods. Behavioral tests in their home cave indicate that the smallest object avoided by them is a disk 20 centimeters in diameter."

https://openalex.org/W2030229128,"The body distribution of gavaged or intravenously administered nitrate labeled with nitrogen-13 was studied in humans and rats with the following results: (i) the labeled compound is not quickly absorbed from the stomach; (ii) the concentration of the label increases inside the lower intestinal tract (cercum and large intestine) when ingested or intravenously injected; and (iii) humans and rats have the capacity to store a portion of the label in their bodies. These observation indicate that depletion of body stores, the passage of nitrate down the gut, or the secretion of nitrate into the intestinal lumen may be a better explanation of the urinary, ileal, and fecal concentrations of nitrate and nitrite recently measured in humans that a bacterial nitrification reaction in the intestines, as suggested by Tannenbbaum et al."

https://openalex.org/W2077607963,"The microsomal metabolism of benzo(a)pyrene and its enhancement by inducers of aryl hywdrocarbon hydroxylase were studied in three C3H mouse fibroblast cell lines and in C3H mouse liver and lung. The cell lines examined included C3H/10T 1/2 CL8, a line that can be transformed by treatment with benzo(a)pyrene; CVP3SC6, a line which cannot be transformed by treatment with benzo(a)pyrene; and C3H/10T 1/2 CL16, a transformed cell line derived from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated C3H/10T 1/2 CL8 cells. Of four polycyclic hydrocarbons examined, benz(a)anthracene was found to be the most effective inducer of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity, while 3-methylcholanthrene did not induce. The extent of this induction in all three cell lines was dependent upon the time after seeding that the inducer was added. The C3H/10T 1/2 CL8 cells were induced by benz(a)anthracene to a greater extent than the other two cell lines. The high pressure liquid chromatographic profile of benzo(a)pyrene metabolites was qualitatively identical for microsomes from all three cell lines and differed from the metabolism by liver and lung microsomes in that the cells did not produce detectable levels of benzo(a)pyrene-4,5-hydrodiol. The reduced CO cytochrome P-450 difference spectra of control and induced microsomes from all three cell lines showed a characteristic shiftmore » to shorter wavelengths after induction with benz(a)anthracene. The specific activity of cytochrome P-450 in the cell microsomes closely paralled the benzo(a)pyrene metabolizing activity as measured both by the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and high pressure liquid chromatography assays.« less"

After the animals had matured, the response properties of neurons in the visual cortex were studied. The proportion of binocularly excited neurons decreased; however, the extent of the ocular dominance alterations was related to the amount and direction of the prism-induced deviation."
https://openalex.org/W28935637,"It has been reported (Ruzicka, F.J., and Beinert, H. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 2514-2517) that aconitase in the oxidized state, as isolated, shows an electron paramagnetic resonance signal centered at g = 2.01, typical of high potential iron-sulfur proteins. Since the magnetic state corresponding to this signal has thus far only been found in tetranuclear iron-sulfur clusters in model compounds and proteins, it could be expected that aconitase also contains a [4Fe-4S] cluster. We show here that core extrusion, in the presence of hexamethylphosphoramide and o-xylyl-alpha,alpha'-dithiol and subsequent ligand exchange with p-trifluoromethylbenzenethiol yield absorption spectra typical of binuclear iron-sulfur clusters. According to the absorbance measured, the concentration of the extruded [2Fe-2S] cluster quantitatively accounts for the iron-sulfur content of the preparations examined. Preliminary studies of the 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum obtained on extrusion with p-trifluoromethylbenzenethiol confirm the presence of a binuclear cluster in aconitase."
https://openalex.org/W2408833597,"Bovine prothrombin has been demonstrated to selfassociate both in the absence and presence of Ca2+ ions. Prothrombin Fragment 1 (residues 1 to 156 of prothrombin) self-associates in the presence of Ca2+ and other divalent cations, but not in their absence. Prethrombin 1 (residues 157 to 582 of prothrombin) selfassociates indistinguishably both in the absence and presence of Ca2+ ions. Self-association of Prothrombin Fragment 1 in the presence of Mn2+ ions has been shown to be dimerization both by sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity measurements. Association constants for dimerization induced by M&+, Ca”, and Sr2+ ions have been calculated from sedimentation velocity data. The ability of the divalent cations to induce self-association is in the order Mn” >> Ca” 2 Sr2+ > M&+. A hybrid “dime? between prothrombin and Prothrombin Fragment 1 has been demonstrated to form in the presence of Ca2’ ions. Fluorescence polarization studies have demonstrated that the rotational relaxation time for Prothrombin Fragment 1 in a viscous solution is increased approximately a-fold in the presence of Ca’+, implying that self-association is reflected in the spectrally monitored hydrodynamic properties, as well as sedimentation properties of the protein molecule. The tryptic peptide which contains 8 of the 10 y-carboxyglutamic acid residues of prothrombin (residues 12 to 44) binds divalent cations and precipitates, rather than undergoing the limited self-association which occurs with Prothrombin Fragment 1. On the basis of these observations, the self-association behavior of prothrombin must be concluded to occur via at least two different mechanisms, one dependent on the presence of Ca2’ ions and one independent of Ca2+ ions. The following observations suggest that specific, cooperative Ca2+ binding and Ca”-induced selfassociation require particular structural constraints in the protein molecule. 1) Divalent cations induce precipitation of tryptic peptides from prothrombin. 2) Previous results demonstrated that when the disulfide bridges of Prothrombin Fragment 1 were reduced and"

https://openalex.org/W43443131,"Enzymatic phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins by a cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase (casein kinase of a classical type) in rat liver is stimulated greatly, sometimes more than 10-fold, by polycations, particularly by basic polypeptides such as polylysine, histone, and protamine. These basic polypeptides themselves do not serve as phosphate acceptors but act as stimulators for the reaction by interacting with cytoplasmic proteins rather than with enzyme. The stimulatory effect varies with substrates employed; with casein and phosvitin the stimulation does not exceed 2- to 3-fold. The cytoplasmic endogenous phosphate acceptor proteins measurable in the presence of basic polypeptides are abundant for this species of protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W114450991,"Human whole blood and washed intact erythrocytes from human and sheep exhibit aniline hydroxylase activity indicative of oxygen activation by the erythrocytes. Formation of p-aminophenol by human and sheep erythrocytes was similar under similar conditions, 5.8 + 0.26 and 5.3 + 0.14 nmol ofp-aminophenol/ 60 min/ml, respectively, at 1 mM hemoglobin and 60 mM aniline. The amount of p-aminophenol produced was directly proportional to the concentration of oxyhemoglobin. Erythrocytes in which the hemoglobin had been oxidized completely to methemoglobin were essentially inert. Hence, oxyhemoglobin plays a key role in the catalysis. Furthermore, studies of the stimulatory effects of lactate, glucose, and methylene blue revealed that NADPH apparently is the important cofactor for the aniline hydroxylase activity of the erythrocytes. Thus, lactate which serves to produce NADH via the lactate dehydrogenase reaction had little, if any, effect on the hydroxylase activity, even under conditions where its ability to support reduction of methemoglobin was demonstrated. In contrast, the addition of glucose with methylene blue led to a 17-fold stimulation of the activity with both human and sheep erythrocytes. Glucose serves to supply the initial substrate for the pentose phosphate pathway which produces NADPH, and methylene blue predominantly affects NADPH-dependent electron transport. The combination of lactate with methylene blue produced no such stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1503515454,"In the absence of carrier proteins, putative androgen receptors elute from DNA-cellulose in the range of 120 to 190 mM NaCl. However, in the presence of lysozyme, most of the receptor elutes in the range of 200 to 230 mM NaCl. This is the same range in which the lysozyme itself, a basic protein, elutes after being chromatographed in the same manner. Moreover, at low ionic strength, lysozyme also increases the sedimentation velocity of both androgen and estrogen receptors. In contrast, bovine serum albumin neither adheres to DNA-cellulose nor alters the sedimentation properties of these proteins. The lysozyme effects can account for some discrepancies reported in the literature. Thus, for qualitative elution studies, the use of lysozyme as a carrier protein is not advised, although its direct interaction with receptors might facilitate quantitative fractionation."

https://openalex.org/W1603738320,"When electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate, highly purified rat renal phosphate-dependent glutaminase exhibits subunits which range in molecular weight from 57,000 to 75,000. Peptide mapping of the separated subunits following limited proteolysis in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate shows that all of the various subunits are related in structure. The glutaminase, immunoprecipitated from Triton X-100-solubilized mitochondria, is composed primarily of subunits which have molecular weights of 83,000. In addition, the series of smaller subunits is generated during storage of the Triton-solubilized glutaminase at 4 degrees C. These results indicate that the heterogeneity of subunit size found in the purified glutaminase results from a noninactivating partial proteolysis of the native form of the enzyme."
