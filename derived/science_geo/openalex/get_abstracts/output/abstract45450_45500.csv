https://openalex.org/W1505978562,"We have examined whether the extracellular matrix is a biochemical target for transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta). We find that TGFbeta increases the expression of the major extracellular matrix proteins, fibronectin and collagen. This effect is a general response to TGFbeta seen in primary cultures and established lines of cells from various types, normal and transformed. The relative incorporation of fibronectin and collagen into the matrix also increases in response to TGFbeta. The effect of TGFbeta on fibronectin levels as characterized in chick embryo fibroblasts is rapid, selective, persistent, and specific, and involves transcriptional events; it is not mimicked by other growth factors tested. The induction of anchorage-independent growth of normal fibroblasts by TGFbeta is mimicked by fibronectin and is specifically blocked by inhibitors of fibronectin binding to its cell surface receptor. The results demonstrate a functional involvement of fibronectin in mediating cellular responses to TGFbeta, and suggest a model for TGFbeta action based on the control of the extracellular matrix in target cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995273609,A chimeric gene containing a cloned cDNA of the coat protein (CP) gene of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was introduced into tobacco cells on a Ti plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens from which tumor inducing genes had been removed. Plants regenerated from transformed cells expressed TMV mRNA and CP as a nuclear trait. Seedlings from self-fertilized transgenic plants were inoculated with TMV and observed for development of disease symptoms. The seedlings that expressed the CP gene were delayed in symptom development and 10 to 60 percent of the transgenic plants failed to develop symptoms for the duration of the experiments. Increasing the concentration of TMV in the inoculum shortened the delay in appearance of symptoms. The results of these experiments indicate that plants can be genetically transformed for resistance to virus disease development.

https://openalex.org/W1971950332,"The development of simultaneous resistance to multiple structurally unrelated drugs is a major impediment to cancer chemotherapy. Multidrug resistance in human KB carcinoma cells selected in colchicine, vinblastine, or Adriamycin is associated with amplification of specific DNA sequences (the multidrug resistance locus, mdr1). During colchicine selection resistance is initially accompanied by elevated expression of a 4.5-kilobase mdr1 messenger RNA (mRNA) without amplification of the corresponding genomic sequences. During selection for increased levels of resistance, expression of this mRNA is increased simultaneously with amplification of mdr1 DNA. Increased expression and amplification of mdr1 sequences were also found in multidrug-resistant sublines of human leukemia and ovarian carcinoma cells. These results suggest that increased expression of mdr1 mRNA is a common mechanism for multidrug resistance in human cells. Activation of the mdr1 gene by mutations or epigenetic changes may precede its amplification during the development of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2020824064,"To study the mechanism of gene repression by DNA methylation, M13 gene constructs were methylated to completion and inserted into mouse L cells by DNA-mediated gene transfer. All unmethylated sequences, regardless of their source, integrated into the DNA in a potentially active DNAase I-sensitive conformation. Total CpG methylation prevented the formation of this structure and rendered these sequences DNAase I-insensitive over the entire methylated domain. Whereas unmethylated DNA demonstrated additional conformational features of active genes, such as DNAase I hypersensitivity and restriction endonuclease-sensitive segments, these markers were not present when methylated DNA was used for transfection. The use of micrococcal nuclease to probe for active or inactive supranucleosome particles also showed that DNA methylation directs DNA into an inactive type of structure. The results suggest that DNA methylation may exert its effect on gene transcription by altering both specific and nonspecific interactions between DNA and nuclear proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1585518597,"In the present study we have used beef heart submitochondrial preparations (BH-SMP) to demonstrate that a component of mitochondrial Complex I, probably the NADH dehydrogenase flavin, is the mitochondrial site of anthracycline reduction. During forward electron transport, the anthracyclines doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and daunorubicin acted as one-electron acceptors for BH-SMP (i.e. were reduced to semiquinone radical species) only when NADH was used as substrate; succinate and ascorbate were without effect. Inhibitor experiments (rotenone, amytal, piericidin A) indicated that the anthracycline reduction site lies on the substrate side of ubiquinone. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin semiquinone radicals were readily detected by ESR spectroscopy. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin semiquinone radicals (g congruent to 2.004, signal width congruent to 4.5 G) reacted avidly with molecular oxygen, presumably to produce O2-, to complete the redox cycle. The identification of Complex I as the site of anthracycline reduction was confirmed by studies of ATP-energized reverse electron transport using succinate or ascorbate as substrates, in the presence of antimycin A or KCN respiratory blocks. Doxorubicin and daunorubicin inhibited the reduction of NAD+ to NADH during reverse electron transport. Furthermore, during reverse electron transport in the absence of added NAD+, doxorubicin and daunorubicin addition caused oxygen consumption due to reduction of molecular oxygen (to O2-) by the anthracycline semiquinone radicals. With succinate as electron source both thenoyltrifluoroacetone (an inhibitor of Complex II) and rotenone blocked oxygen consumption, but with ascorbate as electron source only rotenone was an effective inhibitor. NADH oxidation by doxorubicin during BH-SMP forward electron transport had a KM of 99 microM and a Vmax of 30 nmol X min-1 X mg-1 (at pH 7.4 and 23 degrees C); values for daunorubicin were 71 microM and 37 nmol X min-1 X mg-1. Oxygen consumption at pH 7.2 and 37 degrees C exhibited KM values of 65 microM for doxorubicin and 47 microM for daunorubicin, and Vmax values of 116 nmol X min-1 X mg-1 for doxorubicin and 114 nmol X min-1 X mg-1 for daunorubicin. In marked contrast with these results, 5-iminodaunodrubicin (a new anthracycline with diminished cardiotoxic potential) exhibited little or no tendency to undergo reduction, or to redox cycle with BH-SMP. Redox cycling of anthracyclines by mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase is shown, in the accompanying paper (Doroshow, J. H., and Davies, K. J. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3068-3074), to generate O2-, H2O2, and OH which may underlie the cardiotoxicity of these antitumor agents."

https://openalex.org/W2021388708,"A novel procedure for saturation mutagenesis of cloned DNA was used to obtain more than 100 single base substitutions within the promoter of the mouse β-major globin gene. The effects of these promoter substitutions on transcription were determined by transfecting the cloned mutant genes into HeLa cells on plasmids containing an SV40 transcription enhancer, and measuring the levels of correctly initiated β-globin transcripts after 2 days. Mutations in three regions of the promoter resulted in a significant decrease in the level of transcription: (i) the CACCC box, located between -87 and -95, (ii) the CCAAT box, located between -72 and -77, and (iii) the TATA box, located between -26 and -30 relative to the start site of transcription. In contrast, two different mutations in nucleotides immediately upstream from the CCAAT box resulted in a 3- to 3.5-fold increase in transcription. With two minor exceptions, single base substitutions in all other regions of the promoter had no effect on transcription. These results precisely delineate the cis-acting sequences required for accurate and efficient initiation of β-globin transcription, and they establish a general approach for the fine structure genetic analysis of eukaryotic regulatory sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2056387850,"The newly discovered fission yeast mitotic control element nim1+ (new inducer of mitosis) is the first dose-dependent mitotic inducer identified as a protein kinase homolog. Increased nim1+ expression rescues mutants lacking the mitotic inducer cdc25+ and advances cells into mitosis at a reduced cell size; loss of nim1+ delays mitosis until cells have grown to a larger size. The nim1+ gene potentially encodes a 50 kd protein that contains the consensus sequences of protein kinases. Genetic evidence indicates that nim1+ is a negative regulator of the wee1+ mitotic inhibitor, another protein kinase homolog. The combined mitotic induction activities of nim1+ and cdc25+ counteract the wee1+ mitotic inhibitor in a regulatory network that appears also to involve the cdc2+ protein kinase, which is required for mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1677175288,"We have described a HeLa protein kinase whose activity is inhibited by the nucleotide analogue 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) at concentrations similar to those required to inhibit in vivo and in vitro specific transcription (Zandomeni, R., and Weinmann, R. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14804-14822). We have now detected an analogous DRB-sensitive kinase from calf thymus and purified it to homogeneity. Based on the subunit composition of the enzyme and other common biochemical and chromatographic properties, we identified it as casein kinase II. The extent of DRB inhibition of the purified calf thymus enzyme is indistinguishable from that observed for inhibition of in vitro transcription with the HeLa cell extract. The DRB bromo- derivative, 5,6-dibromo-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole is a more potent inhibitor of in vivo transcription and inhibits purified casein kinase II activity and specific in vitro transcription at 6-10 times lower concentrations than DRB. Moreover, addition of an excess of the purified calf thymus casein kinase II enzyme to a HeLa in vitro transcription reaction inhibited by DRB partially overcomes this inhibition. Thus, we conclude that casein kinase II is involved directly or indirectly in the inhibition by DRB of specific RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. This demonstrates the participation of a protein kinase in a eukaryotic RNA polymerase II-specific transcription system."
https://openalex.org/W2004989086,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus DQ is related to the primary Sjögren's syndrome autoantibodies that bind the RNA proteins Ro/SSA and La/SSB. Both DQ1 and DQ2 alleles are associated with high concentrations of these autoantibodies. An analysis of all possible combinations at DQ has shown that the entire effect was due to heterozygotes expressing the DQ1 and DQ2 alleles. These data suggest that gene interaction between DQ1 and DQ2 (or alleles at associated loci), possibly from gene complementation of trans-associated surface molecules, influences the autoimmune response in primary Sjögren's syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W1985100447,"Supercoiled DNAs, especially those containing enhancers, yield markedly higher levels of expression than linearized DNA when transfected into CV-1 cells or L cells. Different templates, linear or supercoiled, enhancer-containing or not, saturate for expression at 2 μg DNA per dish, suggesting that one role for enhancers and supercoiling is to increase the efficiency with which the same limiting component is used. Plasmids containing only enhancers or only promoters do not compete for expression with an enhancer-driven gene. However, plasmids that contain both enhancers and promoters do compete, suggesting that a second role for enhancers is to increase the binding of a limiting transcription factor. Linear and supercoiled enhancer-promoter plasmids compete equivalently. This suggests that supercoiling affects the ability of transcription factors to activate a given promoter, once bound."

The 169-amino acid protein has no marked similarity to other apolipoprotein sequences, but has a high degree of homology to plasma retinol-binding protein and other members of the alpha 2u-globulin protein superfamily. Apolipoprotein D mRNA has been detected in human liver, intestine, pancreas, kidney, placenta, adrenal, spleen, and fetal brain tissue. Tissue culture cells transfected with the cloned cDNA secrete material that reacts with anti-apoD antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2019392946,"Second-passage rat embryo cells were transfected with a neomycin resistance gene and the activated form of the c-Ha-ras I gene, or with these two genes plus the adenovirus type 2 E1a gene. Foci of morphologically transformed cells were observed in both cases; however, the frequency of transformation was at least ten times higher with two oncogenes than with the ras gene alone. All the transformed cell lines gave rise to rapidly growing tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. All but one of the cell lines transformed by the ras oncogene alone formed metastatic nodules in the lungs of animals that had been injected subcutaneously with transformed cells. When transformed cells were injected intravenously, all the ras single-gene transformants gave rise to many metastatic lung nodules. In contrast, cell lines transformed with ras and E1a did not generate metastases after subcutaneous injection and gave rise to very few metastatic lung nodules after intravenous injection. These data demonstrate that a fully malignant cell with metastatic potential, as measured in an immunodeficient animal, can be obtained from early passage embryo cells by the transfection of the ras oncogene alone."
https://openalex.org/W1970930870,"Genomic sequences derived from the mouse t complex by a microdissection cloning technique have been used as tools to obtain high resolution genetic maps of the wild-type and t haplotype forms of the most proximal portion of chromosome 17. Genetic mapping was performed through a recombinant inbred strain analysis and an analysis of partial t haplotypes. The accumulated data demonstrate the existence of a large inversion of genetic material, encompassing the loci of T and qk, within the proximal portion of t haplotypes. This newly described proximal inversion and the previously described distal inversion provide an explanation for the suppression of recombination observed along the length of t haplotype DNA in heterozygous mice."
https://openalex.org/W1995751727,"The mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene, like several other housekeeping genes, lacks many of the features associated with promoters of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. HPRT transcripts have multiple initiation sites and an HPRT minigene was used to show that only 49 bases of 5′ flanking sequence was necessary for normal expression in cultured cells. The essential region, which occurs within a complex series of direct repeats, is homologous to sequences upstream of other housekeeping genes. When this sequence was deleted, cryptic upstream initiation sites were revealed. Similar aberrant patterns of initiation were seen with all minigenes assayed in Xenopus oocytes. We speculate that this region of the HPRT promoter is involved in a different interaction with the transcriptional machinery to that occurring at more conventional promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2016605966,"We have studied three sites of 3' end formation on the Xenopus laevis ribosomal genes, designated T1, T2, and T3. Site T1 coincides with the unique HindIII site at the 3' end of the 28S sequence and is shown to be a site of rapid RNA processing. Transcription continues another 235 bp past T1 to site T2, which marks a boundary between relatively stable and highly unstable transcripts. However, T2 does not cause polymerase release. In nuclear run-off experiments transcription is detected across the entire spacer until site T3, 215 bp upstream of the gene promoter. T3 shares some sequence homology with T2 but appears to cause polymerase release and is presently the best candidate for a true terminator of transcription on these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2001020273,"DNA sequences and protein factors directing termination of mouse rDNA transcription in a nuclear extract system were examined. Termination is specific and requires a sequence element AGGTCGACCAGATTANTCCG (the Sall box) that is present eight times in the spacer region downstream of the 3' end of pre-rRNA. Exonuclease III protection experiments reveal the binding of a nuclear protein to the Sall box. Deletions, insertions, and point mutations in the Sall box reduce or abolish the interaction with the nuclear factor and disrupt transcription termination. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the Sall box consensus sequence governs transcription termination in vitro, although with reduced activity. Therefore, other sequences normally surrounding the Sall box appear to contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of termination."
https://openalex.org/W1512158712,"The homogeneous 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.50) of rat liver cytosol is indistinguishable from dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase EC 1.3.1.20), Penning, T. M., Mukharji, I., Barrows, S., and Talalay, P. (1984) Biochem. J. 222, 601-611). Examination of the substrate specificity of the purified dehydrogenase for trans-dihydrodiol metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons indicates that the enzyme will catalyze the NAD(P)-dependent oxidation of trans-dihydrodiols of benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, chrysene, 5-methylchrysene, and benzo[a]pyrene under physiological conditions. Comparison of the utilization ratios Vmax/Km indicates that benzenedihydrodiol and the trans-1,2- and trans-7,8-dihydrodiols of 5-methylchrysene were most efficiently oxidized by the purified dehydrogenase, followed by the trans-7,8-dihydrodiol of benzo[a]pyrene and the trans-1,2-dihydrodiols of phenanthrene, chrysene, and naphthalene. The purified enzyme appears to display rigid regio-selectivity, since it will readily oxidize non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols but will not oxidize the K-region trans-dihydrodiols of phenanthrene and benzo[a]pyrene. The stereochemical course of enzymatic dehydrogenation was investigated by circular dichroism spectrometry. For the trans-1,2-dihydrodiols of benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, chrysene, and 5-methylchrysene, the dehydrogenase preferentially oxidized the (+)-[S,S]-isomer. Apparent inversion of this stereochemical preference occurred with the trans-7,8-dihydrodiol of 5-methylchrysene, as the (-)-enantiomer was preferentially oxidized. No change in the sign of the Cotton Effect was observed following oxidation of the racemic trans-7,8-dihydrodiol of benzo[a]pyrene, suggesting that both stereoisomers of this compound were substrates. Large-scale incubation of the [3H]-(+/-)-trans-7,8-dihydrodiol of benzo[a]pyrene with the purified dehydrogenase resulted in greater than 90% utilization of this potent proximate carcinogen, suggesting that the enzyme utilizes both the (-)-[R,R] and the (+)-[S,S]-stereoisomers, which confirms the circular dichroism result. These data show that dihydrodiol dehydrogenase displays the appropriate regio- and stereospecificity to catalyze the oxidation of both the major and minor non-K-region trans-dihydrodiols that arise from the microsomal metabolism of benzo[a]pyrene in vivo."

The break in the short arm of chromosome 9 split the interferon genes, and the interferon-beta 1 gene was translocated to chromosome 11. The c-ets-1 gene was translocated from chromosome 11 to the short arm of chromosome 9 adjacent to the interferon genes. No DNA rearrangement was observed when these probes were hybridized to genomic DNA from leukemic cells of two of the patients. The results suggest that the juxtaposition of the interferon and c-ets-1 genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of human monocytic leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2077473277,The Hu-ets-1 oncogene was found to be rearranged and amplified 30-fold in one case of acute myelomonocytic leukemia in which a homogeneously staining region occurred on 11q23; the oncogene was rearranged and amplified approximately tenfold in a case of small lymphocytic cell lymphoma with an inverted insertion that also involved band 11q23. This work suggests that Hu-ets-1 is an unusual oncogene that can help explain the common involvement of chromosome band 11q23 in various subtypes of hematopoietic malignancies.
https://openalex.org/W1510809129,"The human major histocompatibility complex includes the DP, DQ, and DR subregions, each of which contains at least one alpha chain gene and two beta chain genes. The products of the alpha chain gene and a beta chain gene from a given subregion combine to form a heterodimer which is found predominantly on the surface of immunocompetent cells, and is essential for effective cell-cell interactions and the generation of an immune response. The beta chain of the DR molecule is highly polymorphic, and it is this polymorphism which is thought to be ultimately responsible for the specific immune responsiveness and disease predisposition conferred by different DR molecules. While the sequences of DR beta chains of the homozygous DR1 cells, homozygous DR2, homozygous DR4, DR3/w6 cells and DR4/w6 genotypes have been partially or completely characterized, no sequence is yet available for the DR beta chain from a homozygous DR5 cell. A cDNA library was therefore constructed from the Swei cell line homozygous for the DR5 haplotype. A beta chain clone was isolated, characterized, and sequenced. Comparison with previously published DR beta chain restriction endonuclease maps and nucleotide sequences demonstrated that this clone was a DR beta chain clone. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other DR beta chain amino acid sequences shows three regions of variability in the first external domain, corresponding to amino acid residues 9-13, 26-38, and 67-74. The sequence of each of these variable regions in the beta chain from DR5 cells was identical or nearly identical to the sequences of variable regions found in the beta chains of other DR haplotypes, supporting the notion of gene conversion as an evolutionary mechanism generating polymorphism. The second external domain, and transmembrane and intracytoplasmic regions show a high degree of sequence conservation."
https://openalex.org/W1972981260,"Neural processes from mammalian pinealocytes have been discovered in several brain areas. These processes were visualized immunocytochemically in the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, with an antiserum against bovine retinal S-antigen and traced as far as the region of the posterior commissure and habenular nuclei. This result indicates that pineal-to-brain connections exist in the mammal, and that the mammalian pineal gland, currently thought of only as a neuroendocrine organ, may communicate directly with select brain regions by way of these projections. The existence of mammalian pinealocyte projections is consistent with the view that these cells are not of glial origin but are derivatives of photoreceptor cells of the pineal complex of lower vertebrates that transmit signals to the brain by neural projections."

https://openalex.org/W2073875187,"Serum amyloid A protein (SAA) is a precursor for a major component of amyloid fibrils, which, upon deposition, cause secondary amyloidosis in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In mice, SAA is encoded by at least three genes, which show diverse expression during inflammation. Furthermore, in amyloidosis-resistant SJL mice, the gene expression for one SAA isotype, SAA2, is defective, although SAA2 gene expression is normal in amyloidosis-susceptible BALB/c mice. Because only SAA2-derived products deposit in mouse amyloid tissues, the resistance of SJL mice to amyloidosis seems to be due to defective SAA2 gene expression. Thus, the study emphasizes the importance of SAA gene structure in determining susceptibility to amyloidosis."

In order to investigate the mechanism of this effect, we incubated HL60 cells with [32P]orthophosphate with or without TPA and extracted their proteins with the cationic detergent benzyldimethyl-n-hexadecylammonium chloride prior to electrophoresis in a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel system in the first dimension. In this system, proteins migrate toward the cathode as a function of their molecular weight, and they are separated from other radioactive components which can obscure the pattern of protein phosphorylation on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gels. SDS gel electrophoresis was used in the second dimension, resulting in the clear resolution of a large number of proteins. TPA caused many changes in the pattern of protein phosphorylation in intact cells. Two proteins which prominently increased their incorporation of 32P were investigated in particular, and they were both found to be retained in the nuclear matrix following successive extraction of cells with Triton, digestion with DNase and RNase, and extraction with 2 M NaCl. These proteins migrated with apparent molecular weights of 80,000 and 33,000 on SDS gels, and are designated NP80 and NP33, respectively. NP80 was half-maximally phosphorylated after 7 min exposure to TPA, and half-maximally phosphorylated by 10 nM TPA. NP80 co-migrated with a faint Coomassie Blue-stained protein, and NP33 co-migrated with a more prominent protein. Several proteins incorporated less 32P when the cells were exposed to TPA, including one which was extracted from nuclei with the core histones and which co-migrated with histone H2A. Further study will be needed to determine whether the differentiation of HL60 induced by TPA is mediated via phosphorylation of these nuclear matrix proteins."

The structure of this fucoganglioside was elucidated by methylation analysis, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, and enzymatic degradation, followed by reaction with anti-Lex, Gal beta 1----4 (Fuc alpha 1----3) GlcNAc beta 1----, monoclonal antibody. The structure of this ganglioside was found to be: (Formula: see text). This structure is unique in that a fucose is attached to the internal N-acetylglucosamine but not to the subterminal N-acetylglucosamine. Since this glycolipid is apparently absent in normal granulocytes or acute myelogenous leukemia cells, it can be a specific marker for chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Based on the structures of this fucoganglioside and normal granulocyte glycolipids, a biosynthetic pathway of extension, sialylation, followed by fucosylation is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1572421367,"Following a pulse with 59Fe-transferrin, K562 erythroleukemia cells incorporate a significant amount of 59Fe into ferritin. Conditions or manipulations which alter the supply of iron to cells result in changes in the rate of ferritin biosynthesis with consequent variations in the size of the ferritin pool. Overnight exposure to iron donors such as diferric transferrin or hemin increases the ferritin level 2-4- or 6-8-fold above that of the control, respectively. Treatment with the anti-human transferrin receptor antibody, OKT9 (which reduces the iron uptake by decreasing the number of transferrin receptors) lowers the ferritin level by approximately 70-80% with respect to the control. The fraction of total cell-associated 59Fe (given as a pulse via transferrin) that becomes ferritin bound is proportional to the actual ferritin level and is independent of the instantaneous amount of iron taken up. This has allowed us to establish a curve that correlates different levels of intracellular ferritin with corresponding percentages of incoming iron delivered to ferritin. Iron released from transferrin appears to distribute to ferritin according to a partition function; the entering load going into ferritin is set for a given ferritin level over a wide range of actual amounts of iron delivered."

It exhibits numerous adaptations characteristic of mammals that climb, including strong bony crests and processes (reflecting powerful musculature), ability for considerable forearm supination, a highly mobile ankle joint, plantigrade feet, curved and transversely compressed claws, and a long, possibly semiprehensile tail. These features contrast sharply with those of the oldest artiodactyls and indicate that Chriacus or a similar arctocyonid was not ancestral to the Artiodactyla, as has been proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1536909376,"The priming activities of dinucleotides of all possible base sequences as to the transcription initiation by influenza virus-associated RNA polymerase were investigated. Dinucleotide ApG, complementary to positions 1-2 from the 3' termini of viral RNA segments, was the most active primer and directed the formation of ApGpC; dinucleotide GpC, complementary to positions 2-3, was also an active primer and directed the formation of either GpCpG or GpCpA; but both dinucleotides CpG and CpU, complementary to positions 3-4, were virtually inactive. These results indicate that the transcription is initiated within the first four nucleotides at the 3' termini of viral RNA. Among other dinucleotides, only those hybridizable to viral sequences at their 3'-proximal bases were partially active, implying the essential role of base pairing immediately next to the first phosphodiester bond."

Starfish oocyte depactin is composed of 150 amino acid residues and the N terminus is free proline. The molecular weight is calculated to be 17,590, in good agreement with the value estimated by sodium dodecyl-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Prediction of the secondary structure shows that depactin contains 64% alpha-helix. Comparison of depactin sequence with those of other proteins shows no significant similarity."

The antigen is confined to the nucleus of the interphase HL-60 cell as judged by immunocytochemical localization but disperses throughout the cell during mitosis. The antigen was not detected in leukemic cell lines with blast cell properties or in cell lines representing other lineages. Additional cell lines (ML-1, ML-2, and U937) with myeloid cell characteristics similar to those of the HL-60 cells, which also differentiate in vitro, express the antigen. The presence of antigen in normal human myeloid cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow is consistent with its proposed role in nuclear events associated with normal human myeloid cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1543512341,"Studies of the reactivity of succinyl-CoA:3-keto acid CoA transferase with a small coenzyme A analog, methylmercaptopropionate, have shown that noncovalent interactions between the enzyme and the side chain of CoA are responsible for a rate acceleration of approximately 10(12), which is close to the total rate acceleration brought about by the enzyme (Moore, S. A., and Jencks, W. P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10893-10907). We report here that interaction between the enzyme and the pantetheine moiety of CoA provides the majority of the rate acceleration and destabilization of the enzyme-thiol ester intermediate that is observed with CoA substrates. The role of the adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-diphosphate moiety of CoA is to provide 6.9 kcal/mol of binding energy in order to pull the pantetheine moiety into the active site. The enzyme-thiol ester intermediate, E-pantetheine, was generated by reaction of pantetheine with the thiol ester of enzyme and methylmercaptopropionate. E-Pantetheine undergoes hydrolysis with khyd = 2 min-1, 140-fold faster than E-CoA, and reacts with acetoacetate with kAcAc = 3 X 10(6) M-1 min-1, only 10-fold slower than E-CoA. However, in the reverse direction acetoacetylpantetheine reacts with CoA transferase (kAcAc-SP = 220 M-1 min-1) 1.6 X 10(6) times slower than acetoacetyl-CoA. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of pantetheine with E-CoA is approximately 8 X 10(-6)."

We now have evidence that a factor in the cell free extract is involved in one of the reactions. This factor triggers erythroid differentiation when introduced into undifferentiated mouse Friend cells, provided the cells have been briefly exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide. The factor is induced in nonerythroid cells as well following treatment of the cells by agents that affect DNA replication. Cycloheximide inhibited the induction of the factor. The factor, which is in the cytoplasm, was partially purified and proteinaceous. When introduced into the cells the partially purified factor converts 60% to 70% of undifferentiated Friend cells to erythroid cells, at an efficiency almost equivalent to the efficiencies achieved by typical inducing agents. The factor's biochemical characteristics and possible role in erythroid differentiation are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599263226,"In contrast to reticulocyte polypeptide chain initiation factor 2 (eIF-2), the Artemia factor retains activity in the presence of Mg2+ or after phosphorylation of its alpha-subunit by rabbit reticulocyte heme-controlled repressor (Mehta, H. B., Woodley, C. L., and Wahba, A. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3438-3441). Furthermore, we have so far been unable to demonstrate a requirement for a GDP/GTP nucleotide exchange factor with Artemia eIF-2. In order to explain these differences we compared the structure of eIF-2 from Artemia and rabbit reticulocytes by using one- and two-dimensional phosphopeptide and iodopeptide maps. Partial trypsin digestion of the alpha-subunit of Artemia eIF-2 after phosphorylation by the heme-controlled repressor generates a 4000 Mr phosphopeptide. Upon extensive trypsin digestion, the two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of the alpha-subunits for the reticulocyte and Artemia factors are indistinguishable, whereas the iodopeptide maps are different. In addition, immunoblotting indicates that there is no consistent cross-reactivity of the reticulocyte subunits with antibodies prepared in rabbits against the Artemia eIF-2 subunits. A casein kinase II activity was isolated from Artemia embryos that phosphorylates the beta-subunit of reticulocyte eIF-2, but specifically phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of eIF-2 preparations from several non-mammalian sources, including Artemia, yeast, and wheat germ embryos. Since this kinase phosphorylates a site distinct from that recognized by the heme-controlled repressor, and this phosphorylation does not alter the ability of Artemia eIF-2 to undergo nucleotide exchange, caution must be exercised when interpreting the significance of eIF-2(alpha) phosphorylation in non-mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1584349915,"We have purified a 37,000-dalton polypeptide (p37) from the red cell membrane that was found in previous studies to undergo a lineage-specific alteration in its membrane association. Our data suggest that p37 associates with the red cell membrane through electrostatic interactions that are resistant to 0.5 M NaCl or 10 mM EDTA. Conditions found to elute p37 from red cell ghosts include H2O at pH 12, 0.1 N NaOH + 1 mM ethanol and 1.0% Triton X-100. p37 was purified substantially from ghosts by Triton X-100 solubilization followed by sequential DEAE-Sephadex and CM-Sephadex chromatography. When p37 was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a family of isoelectric focusing variants was detected ranging in pI from 7.0 to 7.8. All of the isoelectric focusing variants showed homology to one another when compared serologically with anti-p37 antibodies or by limited peptide mapping using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The isoelectric focusing variants appear to represent distinct, yet related polypeptides rather than degrees of post-translational modifications to a single species, inasmuch as all of the variants are present in anti-p37 immunoprecipitates prepared from in vitro translations programmed with p37 mRNA."

Single crystals (approximately 0.75 X 0.40 X 0.40 mm) of square bipyramid shape have been grown reproducibly at room temperature in the presence of excess NADH. Diffraction experiments have been performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. The space group is P43212 or its enantiomorph, and the cell dimensions are a = 106.0(5) A and c = 204(1) A. The asymmetric unit is a tetramer of identical subunits of approximately 25,000 daltons each. The specific volume is 2.8 A3/dalton. A native data set at 2.5-A resolution has been collected. Two potential heavy atom derivatives, with K2Pt(CN)4 and KAu(CN)2, have been identified from the diffraction photographs."
https://openalex.org/W1498618549,"The structure of the rhodanese-tetracyanonickelate (E X Ni(CN)2-4) complex has been characterized here in spectral and physical studies using urea as a structural perturbant. UV difference absorption, sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation, fluorescence, and circular dichroism data show no significant conformational differences between sulfur-free rhodanese (E) and the E X Ni(CN)2-4 complex. The urea-induced enzyme structural transition curves were noncoincident when different structural parameters were monitored. For E, the urea concentrations giving half-maximal change (Cm) were: Cm = 3.0 M for activity measurement; Cm = 2.8 M for protein intrinsic fluorescence intensity; Cm = 4.3 M for ellipticity at 220 nm; and Cm = 3.3 M for wavelength of fluorescence emission maximum. For the E X Ni(CN)2-4 complex, Cm was shifted to a higher urea concentration relative to that found for E when activity (Cm = 3.6 M) and native protein fluorescence (Cm = 3.6 M) were the measured parameters but not when the wavelength of the emission maximum and ellipticity were monitored. Furthermore, urea-induced rhodanese structural changes were time-dependent and Ni(CN)2-4 binding on E slowed enzyme inactivation that is associated with structural relaxations. These findings, that Ni(CN)2-4 affects structural relaxations in rhodanese, are of particular interest in light of the recent suggestion that the E X Ni(CN)2-4 complex mimics a normally inaccessible intermediate in catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1480450499,"Addition of nanomolar concentration of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to the human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells is associated with a cessation of cellular proliferation and a subsequent differentiation into macrophage-like cells. Because the growth rate of mammalian cells is tightly coupled to the functions of the protein synthetic machinery, we have examined whether TPA induces a change in HL-60 translational functions. Addition of control HL-60 cell extracts to rabbit reticulocyte lysates results in a pronounced inhibition of protein synthesis, while TPA-treated HL-60 cell extracts are significantly less inhibitory. The reduction in TPA-induced translational inhibitory activity can be observed after a 3-6-h treatment and reaches a maximum after 24 h. Fractionation of control cell extracts on DEAE-cellulose columns reveals two inhibitory activities, eluting at 100 and 350 mM KCl, respectively. The DEAE-100 inhibitor(s) is further resolved into two activities by heparin-agarose column chromatography (HEP-100 and HEP-250). TPA treatment of HL-60 cells for 48 h completely eliminates the HEP-250 inhibitory activity and reduces the HEP-100 and the DEAE-350 inhibitory activities by 50 and 25%. Inhibition of protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by DEAE-100 inhibitory activities can be partially reversed by the addition of globin mRNA while translational inhibition by DEAE-350 inhibitor(s) can be reversed by addition of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2 or fructose 6-phosphate. The DEAE-100 inhibitor(s) causes extensive degradation of radioactive polynucleotides while the DEAE-350 inhibitor(s) is capable of phosphorylating both the alpha- and the beta-subunits of the highly purified rabbit reticulocyte initiation factor eIF-2. These data show that the DEAE-100 inhibitor(s) contains a nuclease while the DEAE-350 inhibitor(s) is associated with eIF-2 alpha and eIF-2 beta protein kinases."
