https://openalex.org/W2005674716,"Regulation of adipose cell mass is a critical homeostatic process in higher vertebrates. The conversion of fibroblasts into cells of the adipose lineage is induced by expression of the orphan nuclear receptor PPAR gamma. This suggests that an endogenous PPAR gamma ligand may be an important regulator of adipogenesis. By assaying arachidonate metabolites for their capacity to activate PPAR response elements, we have identified 15-deoxy-delta 12, 14-prostaglandin J2 as both a PPAR gamma ligand and an inducer of adipogenesis. Similarly, the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs also bind to PPAR gamma and act as potent regulators of adipocyte development. Thus, adipogenic prostanoids and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones initiate key transcriptional events through a common nuclear receptor signaling pathway. These findings suggest a pivotal role for PPAR gamma and its endogenous ligand in adipocyte development and glucose homeostasis and as a target for intervention in metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1984811742,"Evidence suggests that CD8+ T lymphocytes are involved in the control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in vivo, either by cytolytic mechanisms or by the release of HIV-suppressive factors (HIV-SF). The chemokines RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were identified as the major HIV-SF produced by CD8+ T cells. Two active proteins purified from the culture supernatant of an immortalized CD8+ T cell clone revealed sequence identity with human RANTES and MIP-1 alpha. RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta were released by both immortalized and primary CD8+ T cells. HIV-SF activity produced by these cells was completely blocked by a combination of neutralizing antibodies against RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta. Recombinant human RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta induced a dose-dependent inhibition of different strains of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). These data may have relevance for the prevention and therapy of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2050717908,"Prostaglandins (PGs) of the J2 series form in vivo and exert effects on a variety of biological processes. While most of PGs mediate their effects through G protein-coupled receptors, the mechanism of action for the J2 series of PGs remains unclear. Here, we report the PGJ2 and its derivatives are efficacious activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha and gamma (PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma, respectively), orphan nuclear receptors implicated in lipid homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation. The PGJ2 metabolite 15-deoxy-delta 12,14-PGJ2 binds directly to PPAR gamma and promotes efficient differentiation of C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts to adipocytes. These data provide strong evidence that a fatty acid metabolite can function as an adipogenic agent through direct interactions with PPAR gamma and furthermore, suggest a novel mechanism of action for PGs of the J2 series."
https://openalex.org/W2084891010,"The INK4a (MTS1, CDKN2) gene encodes an inhibitor (p16INK4a) of the cyclin D-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 that blocks them from phosphorylating the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and prevents exit from the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Deletions and mutations involving INK4a occur frequently in cancers, implying that p16INK4a, like pRB, suppresses tumor formation. An unrelated protein (p19ARF) arises in major part from an alternative reading frame of the mouse INK4a gene, and its ectopic expression in the nucleus of rodent fibroblasts induces G1 and G2 phase arrest. Economical reutilization of coding sequences in this manner is practically without precedent in mammalian genomes, and the unitary inheritance of p16INK4a and p19ARF may underlie their dual requirement in cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2086255604,"The 60 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR60) is regarded as the major signal transducer of TNF-induced cellular responses, whereas the signal capacity and role of the 80 kDa TNFR (TNFR80) remain largely undefined. We show here that the transmembrane form of TNF is superior to soluble TNF in activating TNFR80 in various systems such as T cell activation, thymocyte proliferation, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor production. Intriguingly, activation of TNFR80 by membrane TNF can lead to qualitatively different TNF responses such as rendering resistant tumor cells sensitive to TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. This study demonstrates that the diversity of TNF effects can be controlled through the differential sensitivity of TNFR80 for the two forms of TNF and suggests an important physiological role for TNFR80 in local inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2136906322,"The crystallographic structure of the G protein heterotrimer Gi alpha 1(GDP)beta 1 gamma 2 (at 2.3 A) reveals two nonoverlapping regions of contact between alpha and beta, an extended interface between beta and nearly all of gamma, and limited interaction of alpha with gamma. The major alpha/beta interface covers switch II of alpha, and GTP-induced rearrangement of switch II causes subunit dissociation during signaling. Alterations in GDP binding in the heterotrimer (compared with alpha-GDP) explain stabilization of the inactive conformation of alpha by beta gamma. Repeated WD motifs in beta form a circularized sevenfold beta propeller. The conserved cores of these motifs are a scaffold for display of their more variable linkers on the exterior face of each propeller blade."

https://openalex.org/W2073205776,The ripening-impaired tomato mutant Never-ripe (Nr) is insensitive to the plant hormone ethylene. The gene that cosegregates with the Nr locus encodes a protein with homology to the Arabidopsis ethylene receptor ETR1 but is lacking the response regulator domain found in ETR1 and related prokaryotic two-component signal transducers. A single amino acid change in the sensor domain confers ethylene insensitivity when expressed in transgenic tomato plants. Modulation of NR gene expression during fruit ripening controls response to the hormone ethylene.
https://openalex.org/W2092249847,"The X-ray crystal structure of the high affinity complex between the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from rat phospholipase C-delta 1 (PLC-delta 1) and inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) has been refined to 1.9 A resolution. The domain fold is similar to others of known structure. Ins(1,4,5)P3 binds on the positively charged face of the electrostatically polarized domain, interacting predominantly with the beta 1/beta 2 and beta 3/beta 4 loops. The 4- and 5-phosphate groups of Ins(1,4,5)P3 interact much more extensively than the 1-phosphate. Two amino acids in the PLC-delta 1 PH domain that contact Ins(1,4,5)P3 have counterparts in the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) PH domain, where mutational changes cause inherited agammaglobulinemia, suggesting a mechanism for loss of function in Btk mutants. Using electrostatics and varying levels of head-group specificity, PH domains may localize and orient signaling proteins, providing a general membrane targeting and regulatory function."
https://openalex.org/W1989968124,"We report the purification of an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) from Drosophila embryo extracts. NURF is composed of at least four polypeptides that act in concert with the GAGA transcription factor to alter chromatin structure at the hsp70 promoter. The energy requirement is attributed to an ATPase activity that is stimulated by nucleosomes but not by free DNA or histones, suggesting that NURF acts directly on a nucleosome to perturb its structure. This finding and the physical properties of NURF contrast sharply with the multisubunit SWI2/SNF2 complex, which has also been shown to alter nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner. The results suggest that two distinct systems may be involved in remodeling chromatin for transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1965014257,"Mutations in the ETR1 gene of Arabidopsis thaliana confer insensitivity to ethylene, which indicates a role for the gene product in ethylene signal transduction. Saturable binding sites for [14C]ethylene were detected in transgenic yeast expressing the ETR1 protein, whereas control yeast lacking ETR1 showed no detectable ethylene binding. Yeast expressing a mutant form of ETR1 (etr1-1) also showed no detectable ethylene binding, which provides an explanation for the ethylene-insensitive phenotype observed in plants carrying this mutation. Expression of truncated forms of ETR1 in yeast provided evidence that the amino-terminal hydrophobic domain of the protein is the site of ethylene binding. It was concluded from these results that ETR1 acts as an ethylene receptor in Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2044126921,"The switch from short- to long-term facilitation induced by behavioral sensitization in Aplysia involves CREB-like proteins, as well as the immediate-early gene ApC/EBP. Using the bZIP domain of ApC/EBP in a two-hybrid system, we have cloned ApCREB2, a transcription factor constitutively expressed in sensory neurons that resembles human CREB2 and mouse ATF4. ApCREB2 represses ApCREB1-mediated transcription in F9 cells. Injection of anti-ApCREB2 antibodies into Aplysia sensory neurons causes a single pulse of serotonin (5-HT), which induces only short-term facilitation lasting minutes, to evoke facilitation lasting more than 1 day. This facilitation has the properties of long-term facilitation: it requires transcription and translation, induces the growth of new synaptic connections, and occludes further facilitation by five pulses of 5-HT."

https://openalex.org/W2068480338,"During meiosis, branched DNA molecules containing information from both parental chromosomes occur in vivo at loci where meiosis-specific double-stranded breaks occur. We demonstrate here that these joint molecules are recombination intermediates: they contain single strands that have undergone exchange of information. Moreover, these joint molecules are resolved into both parental and recombinant duplexes when treated in vitro with Holliday junction-resolving endonucleases RuvC or T4 endo VII. Taken together with previous observations, these results strongly suggest that joint molecules are double Holliday junctions."
https://openalex.org/W1975182459,"Antibodies that catalyze the aldol reaction, a basic carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction, have been generated. The mechanism for antibody catalysis of this reaction mimics that used by natural class I aldolase enzymes. Immunization with a reactive compound covalently trapped a Lys residue in the binding pocket of the antibody by formation of a stable vinylogous amide. The reaction mechanism for the formation of the covalent antibody-hapten complex was recruited to catalyze the aldol reaction. The antibodies use the epsilon-amino group of Lys to form an enamine with ketone substrates and use this enamine as a nascent carbon nucleophile to attack the second substrate, an aldehyde, to form a new carbon-carbon bond. The antibodies control the diastereofacial selectivity of the reaction in both Cram-Felkin and anti-Cram-Felkin directions."

https://openalex.org/W2032432138,"The role of the cytoskeleton during viral infection is poorly understood. Here we show, using a combination of mutant and drug studies, that the intracellular enveloped form of vaccinia virus is capable of inducing the formation of actin tails that are strikingly similar to those seen in Listeria, Shigella and Rickettsia infections. Analysis using video microscopy reveals that single viral particles are propelled in vivo on the tip of actin tails, at a speed of 2.8 mumol min-1. On contact with the cell surface, virus particles extend outwards on actin projections at a similar rate, to contact and infect neighboring cells. Given the similarities between the motility of vaccinia virus and bacterial pathogens, we suggest that intracellular pathogens have developed a common mechanism to exploit the actin cytoskeleton as a means to facilitate their direct spread between cells."

https://openalex.org/W1966571419,"Liddle's syndrome is an inherited form of hypertension caused by mutations that truncate the C-terminus of human epithelial Na+ channel (hENaC) subunits. Expression of truncated beta and gamma hENaC subunits increased Na+ current. However, truncation did not alter single-channel conductance or open state probability, suggesting there were more channels in the plasma membrane. Moreover, truncation of the C-terminus of the beta subunit increased apical cell-surface expression of hENaC in a renal epithelium. We identified a conserved motif in the C-terminus of all three subunits that, when mutated, reproduced the effect of Liddle's truncations. Further, both truncation of the C-terminus and mutation of the conserved C-terminal motif increased surface expression of chimeric proteins containing the C-terminus of beta hENaC. Thus, by deleting a conserved motif, Liddle's mutations increase the number of Na+ channels in the apical membrane, which increases renal Na+ absorption and creates a predisposition to hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1964863428,"The Pto gene encodes a serine/threonine kinase that confers resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a second serine/threonine kinase, Pto-interacting 1 (Pti1), that physically interacts with Pto. Cross-phosphorylation assays revealed that Pto specifically phosphorylates Pti1 and that Pti1 does not phosphorylate Pto. Fen, another serine/threonine kinase from tomato that is closely related to Pto, was unable to phosphorylate Pti1 and was not phosphorylated by Pti1. Expression of a Pti1 transgene in tobacco plants enhanced the hypersensitive response to a P. syringae pv. tabaci strain carrying the avirulence gene avrPto. These findings indicate that Pti1 is involved in a Pto-mediated signaling pathway, probably by acting as a component downstream of Pto in a phosphorylation cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2039597909,"The generation of an accessible heat shock promoter in chromatin in vitro requires the concerted action of the GAGA transcription factor and NURF, an ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling factor. NURF is composed of four subunits and is biochemically distinct from the SWI2/SNF2 multiprotein complex, a transcriptional activator that also appears to alter nucleosome structure. We have obtained protein microsequence and immunological evidence identifying the 140 kDa subunit of NURF as ISWI, previously of unknown function but highly related to SWI2/SNF2 only in the ATPase domain. The ISWI protein is localized to the cell nucleus and is expressed throughout Drosophila development at levels as high as 100,000 molecules/cell. The convergence of biochemical and genetic studies on ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 underscores these ATPases and their close relatives as key components of independent systems for chromatin remodeling."

https://openalex.org/W1989760629,"Coronin is a protein involved in cell locomotion and cytokinesis of Dictyostelium discoideum. Here we show that coronin is strongly enriched in phagocytic cups formed in response to particle attachment. A fusion of coronin with green fluorescent protein (GFP) accumulates in the cups within less than 1 min upon attachment of a particle and is gradually released from the phagosome within 1 min after engulfment is completed. Phagocytic cup formation competes with leading edge formation and can be interrupted at any stage. When the cup regresses, coronin dissociates from the site of accumulation. TRITC-labeled yeast cells have been used to assay phagocytosis quantitatively in wild-type and coronin-null cells. In the mutant, the rate of uptake is reduced to about one third, which shows that coronin contributes to the efficiency of phagocytosis to about the same extent as it improves the speed of cell locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W4230279981,"We have identified and characterized two genes in Drosophila whose products are required for activated RAS to signal with normal efficiency, but do not appear to effect signaling by activated RAF. One encodes the beta subunit of type I geranylgeranyl transferase, a prenylation enzyme essential for targeting RAS to the plasma membrane. The other encodes a protein kinase that we have named kinase suppressor of ras (ksr). By genetic criteria, we show that KSR functions in multiple receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. We have isolated mammalian homologs of KSR that, together with the Drosophila gene, define a novel class of kinases. Our results suggest that KSR is a general and evolutionarily conserved component of the RAS signaling pathway that acts between RAS and RAF."
https://openalex.org/W1972812612,"By screening for mutations that suppress the vulval defects caused by a constitutively active let-60 ras gene, we identified six loss-of-function alleles of ksr-1, a novel C. elegans gene. Our genetic analysis showed ksr-1 positively mediates Ras signaling and functions downstream of or in parallel to let-60. In the absence of ksr-1 function, normal Ras signaling is impaired only slightly, suggesting ksr-1 may act to modulate, or in a branch that diverges from, the main signaling pathway. The predicted KSR-1 protein has a protein kinase domain and is most similar to a recently identified Drosophila protein involved in Ras signaling. We propose that the function of ksr-1 is evolutionarily conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2060840912,"Vulval induction in C. elegans is controlled by a highly conserved signaling pathway similar to the RTK-Ras-MAPK cascade in mammals. By screening for suppressors of the Multivulva phenotype caused by an activated let-60 ras allele, we isolated mutations in a gene, ksr-1, that acts as a positive modifier of vulval induction and is required for at least two other let-60 ras-mediated processes. Although ksr-1 mutations do not perturb vulval induction in an otherwise wild-type background, they have very strong effects on vulval induction in genetic backgrounds where Ras pathway activity is constitutively activated or compromised, suggesting that ksr-1 activity is required for maximal stimulation of vulval fates by the Ras pathway. Genetic epistasis analysis suggests that ksr-1 acts downstream of or in parallel to let-60 ras. We cloned ksr-1 and have shown that it encodes a novel putative protein kinase related to the Raf family of Ser/Thr kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2075339282,"Src homology 2 (SH2) domains on the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) mediate its binding to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in stimulated cells. Using a pharmacological and genetic approach, we show that the amount of PI 3-kinase associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins inversely correlates with the amount of PI 3-kinase lipid products present in the cell. An explanation for this observation is provided by our finding that phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)trisphosphate (Ptdlns [3,4,5]P3) binds directly and selectively to the SH2 domains of the 85 kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase and thereby blocks binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The SH2 domain of pp60C-STC also specifically bound Ptdlns (3,4,5)P3, and the binding was competed by a phosphopeptide specific for the Src SH2 domain. These results indicate that production of Ptdlns (3,4,5)P3 at the membrane disrupts the binding of PI 3-kinase to phosphoproteins. This lipid may also recruit other SH2-containing proteins to the membrane to initiate downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2086296240,"Integrin expression is normally confined to the basal layer of the epidermis, but when epidermal homeostasis is perturbed, the receptors are also expressed by suprabasal, differentiating keratinocytes. We have used the involucrin promoter to express functional human integrin subunits alpha 2, alpha 5, and beta 1 in the suprabasal epidermal layers of transgenic mice. In mice expressing alpha 5 or beta 1 alone or alpha 2 beta 1 or alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimers, there were hair and whisker abnormalities and a failure of eyelid fusion. In addition, mice expressing beta 1 alone or in combination with alpha 2 or alpha 5 exhibited epidermal hyper-proliferation, perturbed keratinocyte differentiation, and skin inflammation, all of which are features of a common human skin disease, psoriasis."
https://openalex.org/W2133128654,"DsbA, a member of the thioredoxin family of disulfide oxidoreductases, acts in catalyzing disulfide bond formation by donating its disulfide to newly translocated proteins. We have found that the two central residues within the active site Cys-30-Pro-31-His-32-Cys-33 motif are critical in determining the exceptional oxidizing power of DsbA. Mutations that change these two residues can alter the equilibrium oxidation potential of DsbA by more than 1000-fold. A quantitative explanation for the very high redox potential of DsbA was found by measuring the pKa of a single residue, Cys-30. The pKa of Cys-30 varied dramatically from mutant to mutant and could accurately predict the oxidizing power of each DsbA mutant protein."

https://openalex.org/W2038144609,"p25rum1 from the fission yeast S. pombe is shown to act as a specific in vitro inhibitor of the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 mitotic kinase. It is also shown that early G1 cells contain p25rum1, which associates with and inhibits the mitotic kinase, and maintains p56cdc13 mitotic B cyclin at a low level, ensuring that these cells do not undergo a premature lethal entry into mitosis. A high level of p25rum1 in G2 cells inhibits the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 kinase that removes the block preventing a further S phase and leads to repeated rounds of DNA replication. Thus, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p25rum1, acting on the p34cdc2 mitotic kinase, plays an important role in ensuring the correct sequence of S phase and mitosis during the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2055738243,"The crystal structure of the V alpha domain of a T cell antigen receptor (TCR) was determined at a resolution of 2.2 angstroms. This structure represents an immunoglobulin topology set different from those previously described. A switch in a polypeptide strand from one beta sheet to the other enables a pair of V alpha homodimers to pack together to form a tetramer, such that the homodimers are parallel to each other and all hypervariable loops face in one direction. On the basis of the observed mode of V alpha association, a model of an (alpha beta)2 TCR tetramer can be positioned relative to the major histocompatibility complex class II (alpha beta)2 tetramer with the third hypervariable loop of V alpha over the amino-terminal portion of the antigenic peptide and the corresponding loop of V beta over its carboxyl-terminal residues. TCR dimerization that is mediated by the alpha chain may contribute to the coupling of antigen recognition to signal transduction during T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2067439821,"Transdifferentiation is a relatively rare phenomenon in which cells of one differentiated type and function switch to a second discrete identity. In vertebrate embryos, smooth muscle and skeletal muscle are distinct tissues that arise from separate compartments of the mesoderm. The musculature of the mouse esophagus was found to undergo a conversion from smooth muscle in the fetus to skeletal muscle during early postnatal development. The switch from smooth to skeletal muscle features the transitory appearance of individual cells expressing a mixed phenotype, which suggests that this conversion is a result of programmed transdifferentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1987444191,"Male Lepidoptera commonly visit stands of water to drink, a behavior known as puddling. Males of the notodontid moth Gluphisia septentrionis routinely puddle for hours, imbibing hundreds of gut-loads and voiding the fluid as repetitive anal jets. Cationic analyses showed puddling to lead to systemic sodium gain, a potential benefit to Gluphisia, whose larval food plant is low in sodium. Male Gluphisia are specialized for puddling, possessing a wide oral slit and a highly expanded enteric surface. The acquired sodium is transferred to the female at mating, for eventual incorporation into the eggs. Sodium acquisition may be the primary function of puddling in Lepidoptera."
https://openalex.org/W1999775190,"Helical junctions are important elements in the architecture of folded RNA molecules. The global geometry of fully base-paired four-way junctions between RNA helices has been analyzed by comparative gel electrophoresis. Junctions appear to fold by pairwise coaxial helical stacking in one of two possible stereochemically equivalent isomers based upon alternative selections of stacking partners. In the presence of 1 mM Mg2+, the two continuous helical axes are approximately at right angles to each other for all junctions studied, but the RNA junctions exhibit significant sequence-dependent differences in their structures as a function of ionic conditions. The four-way junction found in the U1 snRNA folded by coaxial helical stacking. It retained the 90 degrees crossed stacked structure under all ionic conditions tested, despite the presence of a G.A mismatch at the point of strand exchange."

https://openalex.org/W2042644563,"Transgenic tobacco showing replicase-mediated resistance against cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) can be infected by the strain K-CMV. By use of chimeric constructs between full-length cDNA clones of RNA2 of strains Fny-CMV and K-CMV, the existence of two independent mechanisms of replicase-mediated resistance against viral replication and movement of Fny-CMV was demonstrated in these plants. The data indicate that viral RNA may serve as the target for both mechanisms of resistance. A positive correlation was observed between the amount of K-CMV RNA2 sequence present in the chimeric constructs and the ability to overcome the inhibition of replication, whereas a sequence domain was delimited in K-CMV RNA2 responsible for the ability of this strain to break resistance against virus movement."

https://openalex.org/W2005600826,"A search using the Very Large Array was performed for 1720-megahertz OH maser line emission from a number of nonthermal radio continuum sources in the galactic center region. The 1720-megahertz transition has recently been noted for its potential as a tracer of shock activity. The most striking result was the detection of extended 1720-megahertz OH maser emission, as well as a number of compact OH maser features, along the interface between a large-scale continuum shell (G359.1-0.5) and its surrounding ring of high-velocity molecular gas. The morphological correlation among the neutral gas, the nonthermal shell, and the maser features provides strong support for the hypothesis that the 1720-megahertz maser line of OH arises from gas shocked by the impact of the expanding supernova remnant into the molecular material. However, the radial velocities of the molecular cloud surrounding G359.1-0.5 are more negative than that of the OH maser spots by more than 50 kilometers per second. Here it is suggested that only the low-radial-velocity component of the carbon monoxide material at the limb of the remnant satisfies the physical conditions required for collisional pumping of the OH 1720-megahertz line behind the expanding shock front."
