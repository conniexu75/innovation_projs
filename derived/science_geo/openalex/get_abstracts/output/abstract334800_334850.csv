These residues exhibit significant homology with insulin and insulin-like growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1985975295,"Limestone-bearing gravel, the newly named Hulopoe Gravel, blankets the coastal slopes on Lanai. The deposit, which reaches a maximum altitude of 326 meters, formerly was believed to have been deposited along several different ancient marine strandlines, but dated submerged coral reefs and tide-gauge measurements indicate that the southeastern Hawaiian Islands sink so fast that former worldwide high stands of the sea now lie beneath local sea level. Evidence indicates that the Hulopoe Gravel and similar deposits on nearby islands were deposited during the Pleistocene by a giant wave generated by a submarine landslide on a sea scarp south of Lanai."

https://openalex.org/W2023506413,"Light hydrocarbons (containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms) are formed from disseminated organic matter in sediments at the parts-per-billion level by biological and low-temperature (< 50°C) chemical reactions and at the parts-permillion level by high-temperature (> 50°C) cracking reactions. The cooler reactions produce mainly branched hydrocarbons, whereas the hotter reactions yield more straight chains. Hydrocarbon generation zones in the subsurface can be recognized on the basis of hydrocarbon distribution patterns. Hydrocarbons with tertiary carbon atoms form at lower temperatures than those with quaternary carbons. Methane and ethane migrate vertically through fine-grained shales by diffusion and solution, whereas many of the C3+ hydrocarbons show little or no vertical migration. Concentrations of light hydrocarbons, including methane, in fine-grained source rocks decrease to low values in deep, high-temperature (>200°C) sediments. This decrease may be one reason why no economic accumulation of gas has been found to date deeper than 8.2 kilometers (27,000 feet)."
https://openalex.org/W2020984819,"Juvenile orb-weaving spiders appear in spring, when insect prey are scarce but when aerial plankton, such as pollen and fungus spores, is abundant. Microscopic organic matter may be the main food of orb-weaving spiderlings, with insects providing only a dietary supplement. Pollen, which is caught on the sticky spirals of Araneus diadematus orb webs, doubles the life expectancy of spiderlings and alters their web-spinning behavior, so that they spin more frequently than do fasting controls. Fungus spores do not have the same nutritional value as pollen and may be deleterious to the spiderlings."

In 1982 industry consumed one-third less energy than trends established before 1973 would have predicted. Part of this reduction resulted from improvements in the efficiency of industrial process technologies. Most is attributed, however, to slower growth in industrial economic activity and unprecedented changes in the composition of industrial output away from industries that consume large amounts of energy."

https://openalex.org/W1980812894,"1. Japanese B encephalitis virus, obtained from Japanese investigators, has proved virulent for mice and monkeys, confirming the reports from Japan. It has also been found virulent for monkeys when instilled intranasally and for sheep when introduced intracerebrally or intranasally. 2. Japanese B encephalitis virus has been differentiated from St. Louis virus and found similar to louping ill virus according to its reactions in animal species. Serologically, however, it is distinct. 3. Japanese B encephalitis and its related group of primary virus encephalitides of man have been discussed with regard to their differentiation and mode of spread."

https://openalex.org/W2039207802,"Using data from the International Sun-Earth Explorer Spacecraft (ISEE-3), researchers have studied the structure of the magnetotail and its behavior. In the plasma sheet of the distant tail, ISEE-3 found plasma flowing tailward as fast as 1000 Km/sec. An ISEE-3 group at Los Alamos National Laboratory has offered an explanation of the high plasma speeds that addresses how the magnetosphere stores and ultimately rids itself of the charged particles and magnetic fields that it picks up from the solar wind. According to this group the high tailward plasma sheet flows are driven by a process called magnetic reconnection."

https://openalex.org/W2054561198,"Free electron lasers offer several benefits that make them worth perfecting. In contrast to conventional lasers, they are in principle continuously tunable from microwaves to x-rays. Although one device would not cover the entire spectrum, an easily tunable free electron laser would clearly be a marvelous research tool, especially in wavelength regions that are now without tunable lasers. They, also in theory, promise a high overall or wall plug to light energy efficiency. This is an essential feature if the devices are to play a role in industrial or defense applications, almost all of which require high-power radiation that is not too expensive to generate. Most free-electron laser research is supported by the Department of Defense, with a considerable amount by the Department of Energy; this research is discussed briefly."
