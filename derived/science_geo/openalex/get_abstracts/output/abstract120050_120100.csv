The deduced GKLF amino acid sequence contains three tandem zinc fingers that are related to members of the Krüppel family of transcription factors. By indirect immunofluorescence, GKLF is localized to the cell nucleus. In cultured fibroblasts, GKLF mRNA is found in high levels in growth-arrested cells and is nearly undetectable in cells that are in the exponential phase of proliferation. The growth-arresting nature of GKLF is demonstrated by an inhibition of DNA synthesis in cells transfected with a GKLF-expressing plasmid construct. In the mouse, GKLF mRNA is present in select tissues and is most abundant in the colon, followed by the testis, lung, and small intestine. In situ hybridization experiments indicate that GKLF mRNA is enriched in epithelial cells located in the middle to upper crypt region of the colonic mucosa. Taken together, these results suggest that GKLF is potentially a negative regulator of cell growth in tissues such as the gut mucosa, where cell proliferation is intimately coupled to growth arrest and differentiation.

INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic transcription factors are classified according to the structural motif that contacts the DNA. The zinc finger motif is one such example, in which a zinc atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by 4 amino acid residues (usually cysteine or histidine) within a 30-amino acid sequence to form the DNA-binding domain. The biological importance of this structure is reflected by estimates that the human genome has between 300 and 700 genes containing the zinc finger motif (Klug and Schwabe, 31Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar; Hoovers et al., 28Hoovers J.M.N. Mannens M. John R. Bliek J. van Heyningen V. Porteus D.J. Leschot N.J. Westerveld A. Little P.F.R. Genomics. 1992; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A subset of the zinc finger transcription factors contain amino acid sequences that resemble those of the Drosophila segmentation gene product Krüppel (Schuh et al., 51Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U. Cote S. Preiss A. Maier D. Seifert E. Nauber U. Schroder C. Kemler R. Jackle H. Cell. 1986; 47: 1025-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). They are characterized by multiple zinc fingers containing the conserved sequence CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H (X is any amino acid, and the underlined cysteine and histidine residues are involved in the coordination of zinc) that are separated from each other by a highly conserved 7-amino acid inter-finger spacer, TGEKP(Y/F)X, often referred to as the H/C link. These Krüppel-like proteins are involved in diverse aspects of eukaryotic gene regulation such as cell growth and/or differentiation (e.g. Egr-1 or zif/268 (Christy et al., 14Christy B.A. Lau L.F.

Nature. 1989; 341: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)).The eukaryotic cell cycle is a carefully controlled event that requires the participation of several zinc finger-containing transcription factors. It is divided into four major phases: G1, S, G2, and M (Hartwell and Weinert, 26Hartwell L.H. Weinert T.A. Science. 1989; 246: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). Cells that do not divide are considered quiescent and reside in a special niche called the G0 or growth-arrested state. When quiescent cells are given fresh medium containing serum, a cascade of cellular events occur that culminate in DNA synthesis and subsequent cell division. Genes that are induced shortly after quiescent cells are stimulated by serum or purified growth factors are often referred to as the “immediate-early” genes. Among these are several that encode zinc finger-containing transcription factors such as the Egr family of proteins (Sukhatme, 56Sukhatme V.P. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 550-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (which includes zif/268 (Lau and Nathans, 36Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and nup475 (DuBois et al., 17DuBois R.N. McLane M.W. Ryder K. Lau L.F. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The functions of many of these gene products are thought to induce the expression of subsequent “delayed-early” genes that are directly involved in DNA synthesis (Lanahan et al., 35Lanahan A. Williams J.B. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3919-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar).A different facet of eukaryotic cell cycle regulation is manifested by proteins that exert negative impacts on cell growth. The tumor suppressor p53, for example, plays a prominent role in the arrest of cell growth induced by DNA damage (Hartwell and Kastan, 25Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Recently, a group of proteins have been identified and shown to inhibit the activities of the G1 cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases, both of which are essential for the orderly progression of the cell cycle. The mechanisms by which these inhibitors act help explain how antiproliferative signals arrest cells in the G1 phase in such diverse processes as the repair of DNA damage, terminal differentiation, and cell senescence (Sherr, 52Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of one such inhibitor, p21, is induced in response to DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner (Hartwell and Kastan, 25Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar). Similarly, the myogenic transcription factor MyoD causes terminal withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle by concomitantly inducing p21 expression and myocyte differentiation (Halevy et al., 23Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that depending on the signaling event, the mammalian cell cycle is regulated by both positive and negative control mechanisms.In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of GKLF, a zinc finger-containing nuclear protein that is a member of the Krüppel family of transcription factors. Expression of GKLF in cultured fibroblasts is highest in growth-arrested cells and lowest in cells in the exponential phase of proliferation. Moreover, constitutive expression of GKLF in transfected cells results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. In vivo, GKLF mRNA is very abundant in the crypt epithelium of the mouse colon. These findings suggest that GKLF may act as a negative regulator of proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONThe cDNA encoding GKLF was isolated by low stringency hybridization to a zinc finger-containing transcription factor, zif/268. Although not proven in this study, several features of GKLF strongly suggest that it is a transcription factor. First, the amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus containing the zinc fingers is similar to those of a number of proteins, many of which are proven transcription factors, such as LKLF, EKLF, and BTEB2 (Fig. 2). Second, GKLF contains a potential nuclear localization signal between amino acid residues 384 and 390 and is in fact localized to the cell nucleus in transfected cells (Fig. 3). Third, like many transcription factors with short half-lives (Chevaillier, 11Chevaillier P. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), GKLF contains a PEST sequence with a high PEST score of 5.8 (Rogers et al., 48Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). Finally, GKLF contains abundant proline and serine residues, amino acid residues purportedly involved in the transactivation function of many transcription factors (Nakamura et al., 41Nakamura T. Alder H. Gu Y. Prasad R. Canaani O. Kamada N. Gale R.P. Lange B. Crist W.M. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4631-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, its proline-rich nature is shared by proteins closely related to GKLF, namely LKLF (Anderson et al., 2Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), EKLF (Miller and Bieker, 39Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and BTEB2 (Sogawa et al., 53Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Based on the high degree of homology in the Krüppel region of the proteins and their proline-rich characteristics, the latter three transcription factors have recently been assigned to a new multigene family (Anderson et al., 2Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). GKLF is thus the newest addition to this protein family.Aside from the proline-rich domain of GKLF, amino acid sequence outside its zinc finger region further defines its phylogenetic origin. For example, absent from the GKLF sequence are the FAX (finger-associated box) (Knochel et al., 32Knochel W. Poting A. Koster M. Baradi T. Nietfeld W. Bouwmeester T. Pieler T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 6: 6097-6100Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) (Bellefroid et al., 4Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelent O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) motifs, the latter estimated to be present in one-third of zinc finger-containing transcription factors. Genes encoding the FAX- and KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins (called class 1 zinc finger proteins by Pieler and Bellefroid (44Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)) are generally organized in large clusters on certain chromosomes and are thought to have appeared late during evolution. Most of these genes are widely expressed in adult tissues and in most stages of embryogenesis. The Krüppel family of transcription factors (called class 2 zinc finger proteins by Pieler and Bellefroid (44Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar)), in contrast, includes fewer members that are highly conserved and that function in the context of cell differentiation and embryogenesis. The majority of class 2 zinc finger proteins exhibit highly restricted patterns of expression in tissues and during embryogenesis. The tissue-selective nature of GKLF and its close relationship with other Krüppel-like factors such as LKLF and EKLF indicate that it belongs to the class 2 zinc finger protein gene family according to the classification of Pieler and Bellefroid (44Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 20: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Structural analysis of zinc finger-containing proteins indicates that each finger consists of a β-pleated sheet at the amino-terminal half and an α-helix at the carboxyl-terminal half and that the latter makes direct contact with DNA (Berg, 5Berg J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). A number of studies examined the relationship between the amino acid sequence in the helical portion of a finger and the DNA sequence to which the finger binds (Berg, 6Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar; Klug and Schwabe, 31Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar; Nardelli et al., 42Nardelli J. Gibson T.J. Vesque C. Charnay P. Nature. 1991; 349: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These studies revealed a number of important conclusions that enable one to predict the DNA sequence to which a zinc finger protein may bind. Table II compares the amino acid sequences in the α-helical portions of each of the three zinc fingers of GKLF to those of several other Krüppel-like transcription factors along with the DNA sequences with which the fingers interact. It is apparent that amino acid sequences in the helical region of each of the three zinc fingers of GKLF, BTEB2, and EKLF are identical. Moreover, finger 2 of GKLF is identical to finger 1 of zif/268 and nearly identical to finger 2 of Sp1 as well as finger 3 of zif/268. With the exception of EKLF, these amino acid sequences recognize the consensus trinucleotide GCG. In addition, finger 1 of GKLF is highly similar to finger 1 of Sp1, which binds the trinucleotide GGG. Finally, finger 3 of GKLF is very similar to finger 3 of Sp1 and finger 2 of zif/268, both of which bind to the sequence GGG. Based on these comparisons, one can predict a sequence of 5′-GGG GCG GGG-3′ to which GKLF is potentially capable of binding. This sequence is identical to the binding sequences of BTEB2 and Sp1. Of note is that although EKLF recognizes a different DNA sequence despite an overall identity in the zinc finger sequences, it is capable of interacting with an Sp1-binding site (Hartzog and Myers, 27Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE II.Amino acid sequence and DNA binding sequence comparison of GKLF with other Krüppel-like proteinsTFaTranscription factor.FingerbFingers are numbered from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus.Amino acid sequencecAmino acid sequences shown are those present in the α helical region of each zinc finger.

Open table in a new tab The expression of GKLF in cultured fibroblasts is of interest. The cDNA library from which GKLF was initially derived was made with RNA from quiescent NIH 3T3 cells that had been stimulated with serum for 3 h. Because the number of positive clones obtained during a repeat screening of the same library with a partial GKLF cDNA fragment was quite high (>50 positive plaques out of a total of 1 million), we initially thought that GKLF, like zif/268, would behave like an immediately-early gene. We were therefore surprised to find from the Northern blot experiment shown in Fig. 4 that GKLF behaved quite differently from zif/268 or other immediate-early genes. The differences include the following. 1) The steady-state GKLF transcript level was high in serum-starved quiescent NIH 3T3 cells. 2) The transcript level did not rise appreciably during the first few hours of serum induction. 3) The transcript level began to fall at 8 h of serum treatment. In addition, the GKLF transcript was nearly undetectable in RNA harvested from exponentially proliferating cells. Combining the results of serum stimulation (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), serum starvation (Fig. 6), and contact inhibition (Fig. 7) experiments, it becomes apparent that expression of GKLF is associated with cessation of cell growth. It is especially of interest to note that in serum-stimulated cells, the GKLF transcript level first decreases at a time that immediately precedes the S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 4, Fig. 5) (Quelle et al., 46Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that GKLF may exhibit a negative effect on cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S transition phase. The diminished [3H]thymidine incorporation by cells in which GKLF was constitutively expressed (Table I) and the lack of BrdUrd uptake by cells expressing GKLF (Fig. 8) support this hypothesis.The expression of GKLF in response to serum stimulation and deprivation in cultured fibroblasts is reminiscent of that of a group of genes exclusively expressed in the growth arrest state. These genes are divided into two categories: the gas (growth arrest-specific) genes (Ciccarelli et al., 15Ciccarelli C. Philipson L. Sorrentino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Gorski et al., 22Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Patel C.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3722-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the gadd (growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible) genes (Fornance et al., 19Fornance A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar; Zhan et al., 63Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornance A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Like GKLF, expression of the gas genes is highest in quiescent cells and is down-regulated following mitogen stimulation. In particular, the time course of expression of GKLF following mitogen addition to quiescent cells (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), serum deprivation (Fig. 6), and cell contact (Fig. 7) is remarkably similar to that for gas1 (Ciccarelli et al., 15Ciccarelli C. Philipson L. Sorrentino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1525-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; Schneider et al., 50Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and gas5 (Ciccarelli et al., 1990). Similar to the inhibitory effect of GKLF on DNA synthesis (Table I), when ectopically expressed, some of the gas genes cause growth arrest and are thought to be involved in a negative circuit that governs growth suppression (Del Sal et al., 16Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite an overall similarity in the pattern of expression of the gas gene family, they encode a diverse group of protein products. For example, gas1 and gas3 encode integral membrane proteins (Del Sal et al., 16Del Sal G. Ruaro M.E. Philipson L. Schneider C. Cell. 1992; 70: 595-607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; Manfioletti et al., 38Manfioletti G. Ruaro M.E. Del Sal G. Philipson L. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2924-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); gas2 encodes a protein of the microfilament network system (Brancolini et al., 8Brancolini C. Bottega S. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1251-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and gas6 encodes a secreted, vitamin K-dependent protein that is a ligand for the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (Varnum et al., 62Varnum B.C. Young C. Elliott G. Garcia A. Bartley T.D. Fridell Y.W. Hunt R.W. Trail G. Clogston C. Toso R.J. Yanagihara D. Bennett L. Sylber M. Merewether L.A. Tseng A. Escobar E. Liu E.T. Yamane H.K. Nature. 1995; 373: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The gax gene (growth arrest-specific homeobox) is a notable exception of the gas gene family in that it encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor that is highly specific for vascular smooth muscle cells (Gorski et al., 22Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Patel C.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3722-3733Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Finally, gadd153, the only gadd gene with an identified function, is a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors and is the human homologue of the murine CHOP-10 gene (Ron and Habener, 49Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar).In vivo, the expression of GKLF is highly tissue-selective and is enriched in regions of the intestinal tract, testis, and lung (Fig. 9). It is of interest to note that a partial cDNA fragment encoding the putative rat homologue of GKLF was identified in Sertoli cells that had been treated with follicle-stimulating hormone (clone 59) (Hamil and Hall, 24Hamil K.G. Hall S.H. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1205-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Other than its induction by follicle-stimulating hormone, little information regarding the expression of clone 59 is available. In situ hybridization experiments should help clarify the cellular origin of GKLF in the testis. It is clear from Fig. 10, Fig. 11, however, that expression of GKLF in the colon is highly enriched in the crypt epithelium. This finding is supported by the cloning of a putative human homologue of GKLF from the colonic mucosa (see “Results”). Moreover, results of in situ hybridization indicate that the GKLF transcript is localized to a population of epithelial cells residing in the middle to upper crypt region. This portion of the colonic crypt is thought to consist of cells that have undergone growth arrest and that have begun to differentiate into mature colonocytes as they emerge from the proliferating compartment at the base of the crypt (Gordon et al., 21Gordon J.I. Schmidt G.H. Roth K.A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3039-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus, GKLF may play two potential physiological roles in this environment. It can act either as a growth-suppressing gene product that is involved in the growth arrest of epithelial cells as they exit the base of the crypt or as a differentiation-promoting gene product that is responsible for activating downstream genes that are required for the differentiated epithelial phenotype. These two functions are not mutually exclusive such that GKLF can potentially serve both, in a manner similar to MyoD, which promotes both myogenic differentiation and terminal withdrawal from the cell cycle (Halevy et al., 23Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Clearly, the exact function of GKLF in the cell cycle and/or in terminal differentiation awaits further examination. INTRODUCTIONEukaryotic transcription factors are classified according to the structural motif that contacts the DNA. The zinc finger motif is one such example, in which a zinc atom is tetrahedrally coordinated by 4 amino acid residues (usually cysteine or histidine) within a 30-amino acid sequence to form the DNA-binding domain. The biological importance of this structure is reflected by estimates that the human genome has between 300 and 700 genes containing the zinc finger motif (Klug and Schwabe, 31Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar; Hoovers et al., 28Hoovers J.M.N. Mannens M. John R. Bliek J. van Heyningen V. Porteus D.J. Leschot N.J. Westerveld A. Little P.F.R. Genomics. 1992; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A subset of the zinc finger transcription factors contain amino acid sequences that resemble those of the Drosophila segmentation gene product Krüppel (Schuh et al., 51Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U.

They are characterized by multiple zinc fingers containing the conserved sequence CX2CX3FX5LX2HX3H (X is any amino acid, and the underlined cysteine and histidine residues are involved in the coordination of zinc) that are separated from each other by a highly conserved 7-amino acid inter-finger spacer, TGEKP(Y/F)X, often referred to as the H/C link. These Krüppel-like proteins are involved in diverse aspects of eukaryotic gene regulation such as cell growth and/or differentiation (e.g. Egr-1 or zif/268 (Christy et al., 14Christy B.A. Lau L.F.

During the course of experiments originally designed to elucidate the mechanism of the nuclear translocation of MAPK, we found that MAPKK has in its N-terminal region a short sequence that regulates its subcellular distribution and that the sequence has an NES activity. This NES sequence of MAPKK, like the NES of PKI or Rev, is rich in leucine residues, which were found to be crucial for its NES activity. Furthermore, the NES of PKI and the NES of MAPKK competed with each other. These results may suggest a common mechanism of nuclear export using a general leucine-rich NES.

The mutagenesis of Leu-33 to Ala and Leu-37 to Ala in Xenopus MAPKK was performed by method of Kunkel et al. (43Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zabour R.A.

The N-terminal region (residues 1-67) of Xenopus MAPKK was amplified by PCR with a 5′ primer, 5′-ACTAGATATCAACATGCCTAAAAAGAAG-3′, which produces an EcoRV site at N-terminal end of MAPKK, and a 3′ primer, 5′-GCGCGAATTCGTCGTCATCCTTCAGTTC-3′, which produces a EcoRI site at the end of MAPKK. An EcoRV-EcoRI fragment was cloned into pGEX-2T. GST-MAPKK (residues 1-67) was bacterially expressed and purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (23Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898PubMed Google Scholar). BSA (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 9.0 (final concentration, 2 mg/ml), was mixed with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocianate (RITC; final concentration, 0.3 mg/ml) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 4°C for 15 h. Labeled BSA was purified by Sephadex G100 gel filtration chromatography equilibrated in 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl. Rat fibroblastic 3Y1 cells were plated onto CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf, Inc.) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 0.2 mg/ml kanamycine) for 2 days. Microinjection was performed using an IM-188 apparatus (Narishige). The samples in injection buffer (10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 120 mM KCl) were injected into the cell nuclei or the cytoplasm of cells cultured on CELLocate coverslips. After injection, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 3% skim milk in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to rabbit IgG (Cappel) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG (Amersham). The primary antibodies and dilution used here were a rabbit antipeptide antibody raised against the N-terminal residues 1-16 of Xenopus MAPKK (1:100 dilution), a mouse monoclonal antibody to Xenopus MAPKK (4A5) (1:100 dilution), and a rabbit antiovalbumin antibody (40 µg/ml) (Cappel). A peptide (L peptide) corresponding to the sequence of residues 32-44 of Xenopus MAPKK (residues 32-44) (CALQKKLEELELDE) and its mutant peptide (A peptide) (CAAQKKAEEAEADE) in which all leucines were replaced by alanines were synthesized. These synthetic peptides were conjugated to ovalbumin (OV) with a bifunctional cross-linking reagent sulfo-SMCC (Calbiochem). Briefly, sulfo-SMCC-activated OV was prepared by incubating OV (5 mg/ml) and sulfo-SMCC (8 mg/ml) in PBS (100 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) at 20°C for 1 h. Excess cross-linker was removed by a prepacked gel filtration column, Bio-Gel-10 DG (Bio-Rad), in PBS (pH 7.0). The L peptide (3 mg/ml) or the A peptide (3 mg/ml) was added to the sulfo-SMCC-activated OV (∼2 mg/ml). After incubation for 3 h at room temperature, free peptide was removed by a prepacked gel filtration column, Bio-Gel-10 DG (Bio-Rad), equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.0). The L peptide-conjugated OV (L-OV) or the A peptide-conjugated OV (A-OV) was concentrated by Centricon 30 (Amicon, Inc.). The coupling ratios of both conjugations were ∼10-15 peptides/OV molecule because the L-OV and the A-OV had an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa as estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). To generate constitutively active forms of MAPKK that show varying degrees of the activity, we made a number of mutant forms of Xenopus MAPKK according to previously described methods (7Cowley S.

A plasmid harboring each of these mutants or wild-type MAPKK was injected into the nuclei of rat 3Y1 cells, and subcellular localization of the expressed MAPKK was determined by the cell-staining method 6 h after injection. WT-MAPKK and SESE-MAPKK were excluded from the nucleus and located in the cytoplasm, whereas Δ-WT-MAPKK and Δ-SESE-MAPKK were present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). The observed difference in their subcellular distribution seemed to result from the N-terminal deletion in the mutants of Δ-WT-MAPKK and Δ-SESE-MAPKK. Because the exclusion of WT-MAPKK and SESE-MAPKK from the nucleus was so complete in spite of the relatively small size of the molecule (∼45 kDa), which could enter the nucleus by diffusion, we hypothesized that MAPKK might have a cytoplasmic retention signal or a nuclear export signal in the N-terminal region. To test this, we made a fusion protein between GST and the N-terminal region (residues 1-67) of MAPKK (GST-MAPKK (residues 1-67)) and injected it together with tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocianate-labeled bovine serum albumin (RITC-BSA) into the nucleus or the cytoplasm of 3Y1 cells. When injected into the nucleus, GST-MAPKK (1-67) was excluded almost completely from the nucleus within 1 h, whereas RITC-BSA remained in the nucleus (Fig. 1B, Nu.). When injected into the cytoplasm, both proteins stayed in the cytoplasm, excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1B, Cyt.). These results may suggest that the N-terminal region (residues 1-67) of MAPKK can work as an NES. As the deletion of the N-terminal residues 32-51 of MAPKK inhibited the MAPKK molecule from being excluded from the nucleus (Fig. 1A), the NES activity may reside in residues 32-51 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2A leucine-rich NES sequence of MAPKK.

A recent study (38Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) has shown that the NES of PKI is powerful and autonomous enough to trigger nuclear export when chemically conjugated to the transport substrate. To test whether the leucine-rich sequence in MAPKK can act as an autonomous NES, the peptide corresponding to residues 32-44 of MAPKK (the L peptide) was synthesized and chemically conjugated to ovalbumin (OV) through an additional N-terminal cysteine of the peptide. The resultant L-OV had an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa and was estimated to have ∼10-15 L peptides/OV molecule. When injected into the nucleus, L-OV was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, upper) and was excluded from the nucleus almost completely within 15 min (Figs. 3A, upper, and 4, upper). In contrast, co-injected RITC-BSA remained in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, upper). When injected into the cytoplasm, both proteins remained in the cytoplasm (data not shown). The nuclear export of L-OV was sensitive to low temperatures; at 0°C, L-OV remained in the nucleus as long as 1 h after nuclear injection (Fig. 3B). In contrast, a small molecule such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (molecular weight, 389.4) could diffuse out of the nucleus even at 0°C, although the rate was slowed down by lowering the temperature; therefore, the passive diffusion may not be prevented completely by lowering the temperature. Therefore, it is likely that the nuclear export of L-OV may be an active process. The leucines in the NES of PKI were shown to be important for the NES activity (38Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Then, the mutant peptide in which all the four leucines (Leu33, Leu37, Leu40, and Leu42 of MAPKK) were replaced by alanines (the A peptide) was synthesized and conjugated to OV. The resultant A-OV also had an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. When injected into the nucleus, the mutant peptide-conjugated OV (A-OV) was incapable of crossing the nuclear envelope and remained in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, lower). These results, taken together, indicate that the N-terminal sequence of residues 32-44 (L peptide) of MAPKK is a specific and strong NES and that the leucines in the sequence are crucial. To further show that the NES of MAPKK (L peptide) is self-sufficient, we examined whether or not free L peptide could inhibit the nuclear export of L-OV. When L-OV was injected into the nucleus together with an excess amount of free L peptide, the export of L-OV from the nucleus was almost completely inhibited (Fig. 4, L-OV + KK-L peptide). In contrast, the same amount of free A peptide (in which leucines were replaced by alanines) did not inhibit the nuclear export of L-OV at all (Fig. 4, L-OV + KK-A peptide). This result may indicate that the L peptide-mediated export is a saturable process and may suggest the existence of an L peptide (NES) binding protein (i.e. an NES receptor) as a limiting factor for the nuclear export of L-OV. The results presented so far have shown that the short amino acid sequence (residues 32-44) in the N-terminal region of MAPKK can act as an autonomous, strong NES. The identification of NES as a short amino acid sequence sufficient for rapid nuclear export of proteins first came from the recent, detailed analyses (33Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W.

The NES in PKI of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was defined as a leucine-rich sequence, and the similar sequence in Rev was also identified as an NES (33Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W.

Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). The present analysis of a cytoplasmic protein, MAPKK, identified another example of an NES, the sequence of which is similar to that of both other NESs in terms of the positions of a number of hydrophobic residues (leucines and isoleucine, Fig. 2B, boxed), although other parts show little or no similarity. Then, to test the possibility that the NES of MAPKK and the NES of PKI use similar mechanisms, the NES peptide of PKI (PKI-L peptide) and its mutant peptide, in which leucines and isoleucine were replaced by alanines (PKI-A peptide), were synthesized and examined for their ability to inhibit the nuclear export of the NES of MAPKK-conjugated OV (L-OV). The PKI-L peptide, like MAPKK-L peptide, inhibited the nuclear export of L-OV when co-injected into the nucleus (Fig. 4, L-OV + PKI-L peptide), whereas the PKI-A peptide did not (Fig. 4, L-OV + PKI-A peptide). This suggests that the NES of PKI competes with the NES of MAPKK for a common limiting factor(s), presumably the same or a similar NES receptor, and that a leucine-rich NES may be representative of a general signal for nuclear export. It remains to be examined, however, whether or not the NES of Rev competes with the NES of PKI or MAPKK. To confirm the importance of the NES of MAPKK in its subcellular distribution, alanine substitution mutations were made in the NES portion of MAPKK. Two mutant MAPKKs of double mutation were produced: L33A/L37A-KK and L40A/L42A-MAPKK. A plasmid harboring each mutant MAPKK was injected into the nuclei, and 6 h after injection the subcellular distribution was determined. Whereas wild-type MAPKK was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, WT-KK), both of mutant MAPKKs were distributed evenly throughout the cell, present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, L33A/L37A-KK and L40A/L42A-KK). These results may be interpreted as suggesting that MAPKK could cross the nuclear envelope to the nucleus by diffusion if it did not have NES and that the NES of MAPKK may thus define the cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK. Furthermore, the data shown in Fig. 5 support the importance of the four leucine residues in the NES of MAPKK. This NES sequence is conserved in mammalian (MAPKK1 (MEK1) and MAPKK2 (MEK2)) and Xenopus MAPKK. Thus, the NES of MAPKK would be used to ensure permanent cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK. The cytoplasmic localization of molecules in general was thought to be ensured by increasing their molecular size beyond the limit for passive diffusion through the nuclear envelope pore, by their having a domain responsible for cytoplasmic retention, such as binding to other cytoplasmic components, or simply by their not having a nuclear localization signal. In the case of MAPKK, however, its cytoplasmic localization may be determined by its NES. As MAPKK must receive the signal from MAPKK kinase (such as Raf-1) in the cytoplasm, the existence of this mechanism for ensuring cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK by an active process would be reasonable. The cytoplasmic localization of MAPKK would be important, as mentioned above, for the proper, regulated signal transduction from the receptor in the plasma membrane to the activation of MAPK in the cytoplasm. The biological significance of the NES of MAPKK, however, should be elucidated in more detail in future studies. The finding of a leucine-rich NES in MAPKK and the demonstration of competition between the NES of MAPKK and the NES of PKI might suggest a concept of a general leucine-rich NES. The N-terminal region (residues 32-51) of MAPKK containing the NES portion is thought to form an α-helical folding because this portion is predominantly hydrophilic and encompasses favorable residues to stabilize α-helical conformation (9Mansour S.J.

Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). A comparison of the structure of both NESs by the helical wheel representation revealed the same feature: an α-helix with three leucine residues (Leu33, Leu37, and Leu40 in MAPKK; Leu37, Leu41, and Leu44 in PKI) on the same side, forming a hydrophobic surface, and an additional hydrophobic residue (Leu42 in MAPKK; Ile46 in PKI) on the other side (data not shown). These four hydrophobic residues (leucines 33, 37, 40, and 42 of MAPKK (this study) and leucines 37, 41, and 44 and isoleucine 46 of PKI (38Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar)) are crucial for the NES. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that a presumable NES receptor recognizes this common configuration of four hydrophobic residues in the NES to form a complex. Identification of a common NES receptor should be the next step. We thank K. Shirakabe for plasmids of mutant MAPKKs and K.-K. Lee for preparation of GST-MAPKK (residues 1-67)."
https://openalex.org/W1997681070,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins interact with and transduce signals for members of the TNF receptor superfamily. TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF3 share a conserved C-terminal TRAF domain. TRAF2 plays a key role in transducing signals for activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). We have performed extensive mutational analysis on TRAF2, examining the requirements for NF-κB activation, self-association, and interaction with other molecules involved in TNF signaling. Examination of point mutants and TRAF2-TRAF3 chimeric proteins indicates that the N-terminal RING finger and two adjacent zinc fingers of TRAF2 are required for NF-κB activation. The two distinct TRAF-N and TRAF-C subdomains of the TRAF domain appear to independently mediate self-association and interaction with TRAF1. Interaction of TRAF2 with TNF-R2 and TRADD requires sequences at the C terminus of the TRAF-C domain, whereas interaction with the protein kinase receptor-interacting protein V(RIP) occurs via sequences at the N terminus of the TRAF-C domain. Thus, distinct domains of TRAF2 are involved in recruitment and signaling functions."

This expressed sequence tag contained an incomplete open reading frame that therefore was used to reprobe the neutrophil cDNA library to obtain a 2040-base pair cDNA encoding a complete orphan G-protein-coupled receptor of 482 amino acids, which shared 37% nucleotide identity throughout the coding regions with the C5a-R (Fig. 1A). Although similar to the C5a-R, this cDNA contains two predicted extracellular N-linked glycosylation sites and an unusually large extracellular domain between transmembrane domains 4 and 5 comprised of over 160 amino acid residues (Fig. 1A). The majority of the identical residues between the C5a-R and HNFAG09 reside in the predicted transmembrane spanning domains and in the second intracellular loop (Fig. 1B). By Northern blot analysis, expression of HNFAG09 in human tissues and cell lines is distinct from C5a-R expression. An ∼2.2-kb C5a-R transcript was abundantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), lung, spleen, heart, placenta, spinal cord, and throughout the brain. An ∼2.1-kb HNFAG09 transcript was predominantly expressed in lung, spleen, ovary, placenta, small intestine, throughout the brain, and to a much lesser extent than C5a-R, in heart and PBL (Fig. 2). Although by Northern blot analysis the specific cells within the various tissues examined, which are expressing C5a-R and HNFAG09, cannot be determined, these data are suggestive that these receptors are abundantly expressed throughout the body. By fluorescent activated cell sorting using polyclonal antibodies generated to fusion proteins composed of glutathione S-transferase or maltose binding protein and the extracellular loop, this receptor has been shown to be expressed on several cell types, including U937, HL-60, PBL, and human neutrophils and monocytes (8Roglic A. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Pan Z. Zou A. Ye R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 39-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary functional characterization in Xenopus laevis oocytes suggested that HNFAG09 encoded a human anaphylatoxin receptor. 2R. S. Ames, P. Nuthulaganti, and C. Kumar, unpublished observation. To confirm these results in mammalian cells, this receptor was expressed in RBL-2H3 cells (19Siraganian R.P. McGivney A. Barsumian E.D. Crews F.T. Hirata F. Axelrod J. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 30-34PubMed Google Scholar), a rat basophil cell line, which when transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the C5a-R expresses receptors that are functionally active (17DeMartino J.A.

RBL-2H3 cells were stably transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding the C5a-R or HNFAG09, and Fura 2-loaded cells were tested for a C5a- or C3a-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. C5a-R- but not HNFAG09-expressing cells responded to rC5a (Fig. 3, A and B). A robust response to a C3a carboxyl-terminal analogue synthetic peptide (WWGKKYRASKLGLAR) (9Ember J.A. Johansen N.L. Hugli T.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (EC50 = 3.9 nM) was detected in cells expressing HNFAG09, but no response was obtained for C5a-R-expressing cells (Fig. 3, D and C, respectively). Similarly, HNFAG09 but not C5a-R expressing RBL-2H3 cells also responded to native human C3a (EC50 = 0.3 nM; data not shown). C3a was radioiodinated and used in whole cell binding assays to further characterize HNFAG09. Binding of 125I-C3a to HNFAG09 expressing RBL-2H3 cells was competed by increasing concentrations of C3a (IC50 = 3.0 nM) and the C3a analogue synthetic peptide (IC50 = 155 nM) but not by rC5a (Fig. 3E). By saturation binding and Scatchard analysis a single class of C3a binding sites was identified with an estimated Kd of 0.3 nM and a Bmax of 32,000 receptors/cell (data not shown). Curiously, a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing HNFAG09 mRNA by Northern blot neither bound nor responded to C3a (data not shown). RBL-2H3 cells expressing HNFAG09 bind and respond to C3a and a C3a analogue synthetic peptide but not C5a. These data, along with the results of the tissue distribution analysis, are consistent with HNFAG09 (AZ3B) (8Roglic A. Prossnitz E.R. Cavanagh S.L. Pan Z. Zou A. Ye R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1305: 39-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the human C3a receptor. The demonstration that C5a-R (reviewed in Ref. 20Wetsel R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and C3a-R expression is not limited to myeloid cells but that they both are expressed in a variety of non-myeloid cells throughout the body and that they are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system is consistent with these receptors having a much greater role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases than previously suspected. Now that the receptor for C3a has been identified, further studies to elucidate the role of C3a in immune function and disease will be facilitated."

Herein, the ability of intimin, an outer membrane protein from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, to bind β1 integrins was investigated. Solid-phase binding assays revealed binding of the carboxyl-terminal 280 amino acids of intimin (Int280) to α4β1 and α5β1 integrins. The binding required divalent ions (in particular, it was enhanced by Mn2+) and was inhibited by an RGD-containing peptide. Nonderivatized Int280, but not Int280CS (like Int280 but with Cys-937 replaced by Ser) blocked the binding of biotinylated Int280 to integrins. Int280 did not efficiently inhibit β1 integrin binding of invasin from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Both intimin and invasin, immobilized on plastic surfaces, mediated adherence of resting or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated human CD4+ T cells, whereas fibronectin mediated the adherence of only activated T cells.

Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 times in lysis buffer to completely eliminate nonspecifically bound proteins and were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting of proteins transferred to nitrocellulose was conducted with antibodies to SNAP-25 and syntaxin (commercial), NSF and SNAP (from T. Sollner and J. E. Rothman), synaptobrevin-2 (from M.

Mechanical permeabilization of PC12 cells generates semi-intact cells that are highly permeable, allowing access to the exocytotic apparatus (12Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Most of the large dense core vesicles (LDCVs) in intact PC12 cells are close to the plasma membrane in a docked state (17Schafer T. Karli U.O. Schweizer F.E. Burger M.M. Biosci. Rep. 1987; 7: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). LDCVs remain docked in the permeable cells at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). Hence, permeable PC12 cells provide a means to analyze late post-docking steps in the LDCV exocytotic pathway. Ca2+-regulated NE secretion via exocytosis of LDCVs is reconstituted in the permeable cells by provision of MgATP and cytosolic proteins (12Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar).

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Priming preincubations with MgATP and cytosolic proteins fulfill the ATP requirement for Ca2+-regulated exocytosis, whereas ATPγS fails to substitute and reversibly inhibits priming by competition with ATP (Fig. 2a, left). Incubation of extensively washed ATP-primed permeable cells with 10 µM Ca2+ and cytosolic proteins results in NE secretion in the absence (<10 µM) of ATP (Fig. 2a, right). Inclusion of ATPγS did not impair Ca2+-triggered release of NE from ATP-primed cells, confirming that the final steps of LDCV fusion do not require ATP.Fig. 2Requirements for ATP and NSF/α-SNAP in priming Ca2+-triggered LDCV fusion.Show full captionPanel a, priming but not Ca2+-triggered fusion requires MgATP.

Immunoblotting showed that a full cellular complement of the vesicle SNARE (synaptobrevin) and the plasma membrane SNAREs (syntaxin and SNAP-25) was preserved following cell permeabilization. To assess the state of vesicle docking, the association of vesicle proteins (synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin) with plasma membrane proteins (syntaxin, SNAP-25; <1% on purified LDCVs) was determined by immunoprecipitation with syntaxin and SNAP-25 antibodies (Fig. 3a). Immune complexes isolated from detergent extracts of permeable cells prior to priming contained a significant percentage (30-40% and 10-20%, respectively) of the cellular synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin, consistent with the presence of docked vesicles prior to ATP-dependent priming. Immunoprecipitates also contained α/β-SNAP (Fig. 3a) and NSF (Fig. 3b). Hence, complexes prior to priming resembled a recently described “docking and fusion particle” (18Schiavo G. Gmachl M.J.S. Stenbeck G. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1996; 378: 733-736Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). While SNARE-containing complexes can form readily in concentrated brain extracts following detergent extraction (16Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), the complexes detected in the dilute detergent extracts of PC12 cells do not represent a post-extraction artifact since they vary in composition with cell incubation conditions, are unaffected by the volume of lysis buffer used, and are observed upon rapid SDS quenching (see below). When permeable cells were incubated under priming conditions with MgATP, significant changes in SNARE protein complexes were observed consisting of decreases in both synaptotagmin and synaptobrevin (Fig. 3, a and c). In contrast, the association of syntaxin with SNAP-25 was maintained. Extensive decreases of NSF (Fig. 3b) and α/β-SNAP (Fig. 3a) in the complexes were also evident following ATP-dependent priming. These alterations in SNARE protein complexes during priming resembled previously described ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by NSF in detergent extracts or with recombinant SNARE proteins (9Sollner T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). An alternative means for detecting SNARE protein complexes was also used, which relies on the reported SDS-resistance of ternary complexes formed by SNARE proteins (16Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Analysis of SDS extracts of permeable PC12 cells (Fig. 4a) revealed ∼230-, ∼110-, and ∼75-kDa SDS-resistant complexes that contained significant percentages of the cellular SNARE proteins (24%, 22%, and 38% of the synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin, respectively). Decreased amounts of the SDS-resistant complexes were evident following ATP-dependent priming (Fig. 4, a and b), confirming that SNARE protein complexes disassemble during priming. NSF in the permeable cells was responsible for catalyzing SNARE complex rearrangements during priming since the reaction was inhibited by NEM and ATPγS (Fig. 4c), agents that block NSF activity (9Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 5Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and inhibition by NEM was overcome by inclusion of recombinant NSF and α-SNAP (Fig. 4c). Neither protein alone was effective (not shown). Following ATP-dependent priming, a portion (40-70%) of the NSF and SNAP proteins present in permeable cells was released to the soluble fraction of the incubations. This release of NSF and SNAP from permeable cells depended upon MgATP and was inhibited by ATPγS and NEM (Fig. 4d), consistent with recycling of these proteins following ATP hydrolysis (5Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar, 9Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). No additional release of NSF and SNAP (Fig. 4d) was detected following Ca2+ triggering of LDCV fusion in ATP-primed cells, suggesting that NSF action was restricted to priming. This was also indicated by the lack of significant further changes in SNARE protein complexes during Ca2+ triggering (Fig. 3a). 25-30% of NSF and SNAP is retained by cells following permeabilization and washing. This appears to be adequate to sustain late stages of the LDCV exocytotic pathway, since addition of recombinant NSF and α-SNAP did not stimulate ATP-dependent, Ca2+-activated NE secretion (not shown). While secretion is NEM-sensitive, inhibition by NEM was not overcome by NSF (and/or SNAP) addition presumably because other NEM-sensitive proteins are required. The further release of NSF and SNAP from permeable cells during ATP-dependent priming (see Fig. 4d), however, suggested that it may be feasible to render these proteins rate-limiting for regulated NE secretion. Priming is reversed in incubations that lack ATP and multiple cycles of priming, and its reversal can be sustained in sequential incubations (10Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Hence, the permeable cells were incubated under priming conditions with MgATP and washed to remove eluted NSF/SNAP. The permeable cells were then incubated without MgATP to reverse priming. Finally, these were incubated under various conditions to determine the requirements for optimal priming. Priming in these pretreated permeable cells was entirely MgATP-dependent as anticipated (Fig. 2b). However, priming was now also stimulated by a combination of NSF and α-SNAP, whereas neither protein alone was effective. Cytosol, which lacks active NSF (22Block M.R. Glick B.S. Wilcox C.A. Wieland F.T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7852-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), also stimulated priming as anticipated due to its content of PEP proteins (10Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 13Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 14Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Maximal priming was observed by addition of both NSF/SNAP and cytosolic PEP proteins, indicating that both polyphosphoinositide synthesis (14Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and NSF-catalyzed reactions contribute to the MgATP-dependent priming of exocytosis. The effects of NSF and α-SNAP on secretion were restricted to priming, and no stimulation by NSF and/or α-SNAP was evident in Ca2+-dependent triggering reactions (not shown). The discovery that NSF and SNAP proteins interact with a core complex of neuronal synaptic SNARE proteins suggested a role for NSF in regulated exocytosis (5Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar), but the precise point of action of NSF in the regulated secretory pathway has not previously been established. In vitro biochemical studies demonstrated that a 20 S complex of SNAREs, NSF, and α/β-SNAP was disassembled by the ATP-dependent activity of NSF (21Morgan A. Dimaline R. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29347-29350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested that NSF-catalyzed protein rearrangements drive membrane fusion (9Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). This model implied that the fusion step in regulated exocytosis is ATP-dependent and follows a Ca2+-dependent step (9Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). In contrast, our studies support an alternative model (23O'Connor V. Augustine G.J. Betz H. Cell. 1994; 76: 785-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar) that the execution point of NSF is during the reversible ATP-dependent activation step (priming) that can follow docking and that precedes Ca2+-activated fusion (Fig. 4e). While our results imply that NSF is not directly involved in the final stages that lead to full fusion in the regulated exocytotic pathway, ATP-dependent catalysis of SNARE protein rearrangements by NSF may generate a prefusion intermediate possibly similar to that suggested for viral fusion mechanisms (25Kemble G.W. Danielli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). NSF could catalyze an ATP-dependent conformational change in SNARE proteins (9Sollner T.

In constitutive fusion events, this intermediate may spontaneously resolve to full fusion. In regulated exocytosis, this intermediate would be arrested and require Ca2+ to allow progression to full fusion. Physical evidence for a prefusion intermediate should be sought."

The mechanism by which A20 exerts its protective effect is currently unknown. Several isoforms of the 14-3-3 proteins were found to interact with A20 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. A20 bound several 14-3-3 isoforms in vitro. Moreover, transfected A20 was found to preferentially bind the endogenous η14-3-3 isoform, whereas the β/ζ isoforms co-immunoprecipitated much less efficiently, and ϵ14-3-3 had an intermediate affinity.

The cellular localization and subcellular fractionation of A20 was dramatically altered by co-transfected 14-3-3, providing the first experimental evidence for the notion that 14-3-3 can function as a chaperone.

INTRODUCTIONTumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. is a catabolic pro-inflammatory cytokine that is capable of inducing apoptotic death in a number of tumor cell lines. The systemic toxicity of TNF and the generation of TNF resistant clones have in large part contributed to the therapeutic failure of TNF as an anti-cancer agent. To understand the molecular mechanism of TNF and the basis of sensitivity and resistance to TNF killing, we cloned TNF-inducible primary response genes by differential hybridization (1Dixit V.M. Green S. Sarma V. Holzman L.B. Wolf F.W. O'Rourke K. Ward P.A. Prochownik E.V. Marks R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2973-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the genes, designated A20, conferred resistance to TNF killing when transfected into sensitive NIH3T3, WEHI 164, and MCF7 cells (2Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, breast carcinoma cell lines that were resistant to TNF cytotoxicity expressed higher levels of A20 than corresponding sensitive lines (2Opipari Jr., A.W. Hu H.M. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of A20 is subverted by a number of gene products including the LMP-1 gene product of the Epstein-Barr virus, a known inhibitor of apoptosis (3Laherty C.D. Hu H.M. Opipari A.W. Wang F. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24157-24160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is plausible that virally mediated induction of A20 and subsequent resistance to apoptosis and cytokine killing contributes to host immune response attenuation and viral persistence.Analysis of the full-length A20 cDNA revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 790 amino acid residues, which showed no significant homology to previously described proteins (4Opipari Jr., A.W. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14705-14708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, within A20 a distinct repeated element was found that included seven novel zinc finger motifs of the form CX4CX11CX2C. The repression of its own promoter activity, coupled with the presence of zinc fingers, initially suggested that A20 might be a transcriptional factor (5Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, immunolocalization studies revealed A20 to be a cytoplasmic protein, 2M. Tewari, manuscript in preparation. consistent with the finding that other zinc finger proteins, including protein kinase C and c-Raf, are non-nuclear.To derive a biochemical understanding of how A20 functions, a yeast two-hybrid screen was utilized to identify A20-interacting proteins. The 14-3-3 family of proteins was found to specifically bind A20 and could function as adapter molecules mediating the interaction of A20 with c-Raf, a Ser/Thr kinase of pivotal importance to a number of signaling pathways.14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved and are ubiquitous in the animal and plant kingdoms. At least seven mammalian isoforms have been identified. Previously, 14-3-3 proteins had been shown to function as regulators of protein kinase C, tryptophan, and tyrosine hydroxylases and to be essential for the stimulation of exocytosis from chromaffin cells (see Ref. 6Aitken A.

However, interest in 14-3-3 has recently been stimulated by the discovery that oncogene products, including Raf-1(7-13), Bcr-Abl, Bcr (14Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.M.

S. A. 1995; 92: 7892-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) associate with 14-3-3. Moreover, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 14-3-3 homologues, rad24 and rad25, are required for DNA damage checkpoint control and, therefore, the timing of mitosis (18Ford J.C. Khodairy F. Fotou E. Sheldrick K.S. Griffiths D.J. Carr A.M. Science. 1994; 265: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The importance of 14-3-3 in signal transduction is further corroborated by reports that 14-3-3 interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (19Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and glycoprotein Ib-IX (20Du X. Harris S.J.

The interaction of Raf with 14-3-3 leads to Raf activation in several in vivo systems (7Fantl W.J. Muslin A.J. Kikuchi A. Martin J.A. MacNicol A.M. Gross R.W. Williams L.T. Fanti W.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Overexpression of 14-3-3 in Jurkat cells leads to decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase stimulation by anti-CD3 (19Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H. Ishizaka K. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10142-10146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). One potential mechanism by which 14-3-3 could exert a variety of functions is by its ability to form dimers. It could act as an adapter between two molecules and thereby modulate their activity (21Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).In this report we demonstrate that 14-3-3 can mediate the interaction of A20 and Raf by functioning as a bridging adapter molecule. Additionally, 14-3-3 proteins can serve as chaperones, promoting the transition of A20 from insoluble punctate cytoplasmic structures to the soluble cytoplasmic compartment.

Overexpression of 14-3-3 in Jurkat cells leads to decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase stimulation by anti-CD3 (19Bonnefoy-Berard N. Liu Y. von Willebrand M. Sung A. Elly C. Mustelin T. Yoshida H.

One potential mechanism by which 14-3-3 could exert a variety of functions is by its ability to form dimers. It could act as an adapter between two molecules and thereby modulate their activity (21Jones D.H. Ley S. Aitken A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 55-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).In this report we demonstrate that 14-3-3 can mediate the interaction of A20 and Raf by functioning as a bridging adapter molecule. Additionally, 14-3-3 proteins can serve as chaperones, promoting the transition of A20 from insoluble punctate cytoplasmic structures to the soluble cytoplasmic compartment."

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been used to examine simultaneously for the first time the relationship between chelation of intracellular iron and the rate of removal and regeneration of the tyrosyl radical of ribonucleotide reductase within intact human leukemia K562 cells. The different physiochemical characteristics of relatively hydrophobic low molecular weight bidentate hydroxypyridinone chelators and the higher molecular weight hexadentate ferrioxamine have been exploited to elucidate these interactions further. The base-line concentration of EPR-detectable mononuclear nonheme iron complexes was 3.15 ± 1.05 µM, rising on incubation with chelators more rapidly with hydroxypyridinones than with desferrioxamine. Hydroxypyridinones also removed the tyrosyl radical more rapidly, apparently as a consequence of depletion of the intracellular iron pools necessary to regenerate the active enzyme and compatible with their reportedly greater cell toxicity. The radical decay rate is consistent with previous models, suggesting that iron is spontaneously removed from mammalian ribonucleotide reductase. Upon removal of extracellular chelator the regeneration of the tyrosyl radical was significantly faster for hydroxypyridinones than for desferrioxamine, consistent with their differential effects on cell cycle synchronization.

The reaction of the reduced binuclear iron center with oxygen generates a protein-bound tyrosyl radical (8Gräslund A. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Environ.

The concentration of this radical correlates with enzyme activity (8Gräslund A. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Environ. Health Perspect. 1985; 64: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The binuclear iron center also appears to stabilize the radical during steady-state turnover of the enzyme. The iron center and tyrosine radical are buried in the protein (5Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Nature. 1990; 345: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) but can react with a number of free radical scavengers, antioxidants, and reductants (3Lammers M. Follmann H. Struct.

Chem. 1985; 260: 2737-2741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once formed, the radical in the isolated mammalian enzyme has a half-life (t1/2) of 10 min under anaerobic conditions (12Thelander M. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2737-2741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While mammalian ribonucleotide reductase requires only dithiothreitol, oxygen, and iron for regeneration of the tyrosyl radical (13Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Thelander L. Gräslund A. Thelander M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 110: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), bacterial ribonucleotide reductase appears to require a radical introducing system (11Reichard P. Ehrenberg A.

The mammalian enzyme is found predominantly in the cytosol of cells and has a t1/2 of approximately 3 h; quantities increase 3-7-fold immediately prior to and during S phase of cell cycle as a result of de novo protein synthesis (16Engstrom Y.

The Fe3+ chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) is used in the clinical treatment of diseases of iron overload e.g. hemochromatosis, β-thalassemia (18Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Singh S. Bergeron R.J. Brittenham G. The Development of Iron Chelators for Clinical Use. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 353Google Scholar). It is known that Fe3+ chelators can inhibit the ability of ribonucleotide reductase to reduce ribonucleotides in intact cells at concentrations in the micromolar range (19Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar, 20Barankiewicz J. Cohen A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2343-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved are poorly understood, however, as is the exact relationship of ribonucleotide reductase inhibition to the antiproliferative effects of iron chelators. Much of the work concerning the mechanisms of inhibition has been carried out either on isolated bacterial enzyme or on purified, recombinant murine enzyme, with relatively few data on the interactions of chelators within intact cells (21Nocentini G. Federici F. Franchetti P. Barzi A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of intracellular ribonucleotide reductase inhibition and regeneration in relation to the formation of intracellular iron-chelate complexes have not been studied. Given the resistance of the iron center of ribonucleotide reductase to chelation in the E. coli enzyme (23Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Brown N.C. Eliasson R. Reichard P. Thelander L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) it seems unlikely that chelators directly remove iron from the binuclear center in the mammalian enzyme. A more plausible explanation for the in vivo inhibitory effects is that intracellular iron chelation deprives the cell of sufficient iron to incorporate into newly synthesized apoenzyme. Recent work has suggested, however, that unlike bacterial ribonucleotide reductase (23Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), purified recombinant mouse enzyme may lose its iron spontaneously at physiological temperatures (22Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These investigators concluded that hexadentate iron chelators, such as desferrioxamine, may act on soluble rather than protein-bound iron by preventing the reincorporation of iron into old, as well as newly synthesized enzyme. Some iron chelators may inhibit mammalian ribonucleotide reductase, through a mechanism involving redox-active Fe2+ (21Nocentini G. Federici F. Franchetti P. Barzi A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar, 25Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4063-4066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the Fe3+ complex of DFO is highly stable (18Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Singh S. Bergeron R.J. Brittenham G. The Development of Iron Chelators for Clinical Use. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 353Google Scholar) and the iron cannot participate in redox cycling, it is unlikely that DFO acts by this mechanism. There is evidence obtained with purified E. coli enzyme that low molecular weight reductants can gain access to the iron core and alter the redox state directly rather than by long range electron transfer, which might be predicted from the deeply buried iron center (26Gerez C. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is conceivable, therefore, that low molecular weight lipophilic chelators could also interact directly with the iron center. Bidentate hydroxypyridinones (HPOs) form a class of low molecular weight Fe3+ chelators of considerable clinical interest (27Dobbin P.S. Hider R.C. Hall A.D. Taylor P.D. Sarpond P. Porter J.B. Xiao G. Ven Helm D. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 2448-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that are known to inhibit intracellular ribonucleotide reductase (19Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action is not known and has not been studied by EPR techniques. The kinetics of the effects on cell cycle induced by bidentate HPOs differ substantially from those induced by the hexadentate DFO (19Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar). HPOs also appear to be more inhibitory to bone marrow in vivo than DFO (19Hoyes K.P. Hider R.C. Porter J.B. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4591-4599PubMed Google Scholar). Three molecules of HPO can simultaneously coordinate one Fe3+ atom and have approximately one-third the molecular weight of the hexadentate DFO, which binds Fe3+ in a 1:1 ratio. By virtue of their lower molecular weight, as well as their neutral charge and relative lipophilicity, they may gain access to intracellular iron pools more rapidly than DFO (28Hoyes K.P. Porter J.B. Br. J. Haematol. 1993; 85: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Low temperature EPR spectroscopy permits the simultaneous detection of both the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosine radical (g = 2.0) and intracellular iron-chelate complexes (g = 4.3). Preliminary studies demonstrated that human K562 leukemia cells give a sufficiently strong tyrosine radical signal for the kinetics of inhibition and regeneration to be studied in intact cells (29Porter J.B. Lynagh G.R. Cooper C. Hider R.C. Cammack R. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 84 (Suppl. 1): 64Google Scholar). We have therefore used this cell line to investigate the relationship between chelation of intracellular iron and the suppression of the tyrosyl radical of intracellular ribonucleotide reductase. This system will provide information on the mechanisms underlying the apparent differences in toxicity of DFO and the bidentate HPOs. 1,2-Diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP94) and 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP20) were synthesized as described previously (27Dobbin P.S. Hider R.C. Hall A.D. Taylor P.D. Sarpond P. Porter J.B. Xiao G. Ven Helm D. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 2448-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Purity was confirmed by 1H NMR, elemental analysis, and reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. DFO was purchased from Ciba-Geigy (Basel, Switzerland). [14C]CP94 (2.405 MBq/mg) and [14C]DFO (185 Bq/mg) were a kind gift from Dr. H. H. Peter of Ciba-Geigy. RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK) and PBS from Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK). The structure of the chelators used is illustrated in (Fig. 1). DFO, CP94, and CP20 were added to cells in exponential growth from a concentrated stock solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The same volume of PBS was added to control cultures. Since DFO is a hexadentate ligand and coordinates iron in a 1:1 ratio, but the bidentate hydroxypyridin-4-ones coordinate in a 3:1 (chelator:iron) manner, activity was compared on a 3:1 molar basis so that equivalent iron binding capacities were achieved, and results are expressed as µM iron binding equivalents (IBE). K562 cells were cultured at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium with 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum under CO2/air (1:19). Cell stocks were maintained at 2-6 × 105 cells/ml. To ensure that cells were in exponential growth, media were changed 24 h prior to all experiments; cell viability as determined by ethidium bromide/acridine orange fluorescence microscopy was greater than 95% for all experiments. During experiments cells were grown at 4 × 105/ml (200 ml/flask), and chelator was added from a 33 × concentrated stock. Cells were frozen in order to study their low temperature EPR spectra. In most studies unwashed cells were used for freezing. However, in order to study the effect of the removal of chelator from the incubation medium, at the end of the 24-h incubation period cells were spun down and resuspended in 50 ml of chelator-free medium. At different times, subsequent to this washing, cells were harvested for EPR analysis. Cells were prepared for EPR analysis by centrifuging at 500 × g for 3 min at 37°C, removing the supernatant, and vortex-mixing the cell pellet. 200-µl aliquots were frozen in EPR tubes. The tubes containing the cells were rapidly frozen (<5 s) in cold methanol and stored in liquid nitrogen. The overall time taken for spinning and freezing was less than 6 min. K562 cells were spun down into a pellet, and 1-ml quantities of packed cells were placed in microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were probe-sonicated (Soniprep 150, MSE) as described previously (30Roberts P.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 2727-2734Crossref Google Scholar) at 5-µm amplitude for 2 × 15 s and put on ice. The cells were microcentrifuged at 13,000 × g for 4 min, and the supernatant was removed. The supernatant was immediately divided into three fractions, and CP94, DFO, or control (PBS) was added to the required final chelator concentration of 300 µM IBE. Incubation proceeded at 37 or 4°C before removal of 200-µl aliquots at the required time points, which were taken into EPR tubes, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and analyzed as described above. Human apotransferrin was labeled with 59Fe and saturated to 90% with ferrous ammonium sulfate. 59Fe and 56Fe were randomized in a minimal volume of 0.05 M H2SO4 and added dropwise to human apotransferrin dissolved in 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, in the presence of 5 mM bicarbonate. After 1 h of incubation at 37°C, the pink 59Fe-labeled transferrin solution was dialyzed overnight against 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The solution was then passed down a 20 × 70-mm diaminoethyl-Sepharose CL6B column and eluted with a linear Tris-HCl/NaCl ionic gradient. The protein-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS prior to storage at 4°C. K562 cells (2 × 106/ml) were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 100 µg/ml 59Fe-labeled diferric transferrin at 37°C for 3 h. After washing with PBS, the 59Fe-loaded cells were resuspended in culture medium in the presence or absence of 100 µM IBE CP94 or DFO. The cells were incubated at 37°C and sampled at regular intervals. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed and retained. The cells were washed three times with PBS, and the amount of 59Fe in the cells, supernatant, and each wash was measured using an LKB γ-counter. For the purposes of calculating intracellular iron-chelate complexes or tyrosyl radical, experiments were performed to determine whether the trapping of medium between packed K562 cells was appreciable. This would lead to an underestimate of the true intracellular concentrations. Intercellular trapping was measured by mixing 10 µl of 125I (50 µl/ml) with 1 ml of cells and placing in a Hawksley capillary tube via capillarity, leaving approximately 15 mm unfilled. The dry end was then heat-sealed, and the external surfaces were wiped clean. After centrifugation for 5 min in a Hawksley microhematocrit centrifuge (Gelman Hawksley Limited, Lancing, Sussex, UK), the packed cell volume (PCV) expressed as a percentage of total volume (cells + supernatant) was calculated. The open ends of the tubes were sealed with plasticine, and the tube was cut with a metal file at the interface between cells and the supernatant. The counts in the packed cells and supernatant were determined using a γ-counter. The percentage of trapped plasma (%TP) in the packed cell column (PCC) was calculated with the formula, %TP=Count rate in PCC ×(1-PCV)×100 Count rate in plasma and PCC× PCV(Eq. 1) The percentage of plasma trapping in these packed cells was 7.8 ± 1.24% from three experiments. It is likely, therefore, that the calculated concentrations of the tyrosyl radical and iron complexes are an underestimate by at most 10%. Cells were stored in liquid nitrogen and analyzed using a Bruker ESP 300 EPR spectrometer with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 helium cryostat. Each tube contained 80-100 million cells (0.5 ml total volume). The spectra were recorded at 30 K under nonsaturating conditions: 20 mW for the iron complexes (g = 4.3) and 2 mW for the tyrosyl radical (g = 2). As for the mouse enzyme (13Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the electron-spin relaxation properties of the human enzyme were such that it could be readily quantitated at low temperature at this relatively high microwave power. In order to show the structure of the radical, spectra in the g = 2 region were recorded at 0.5-mT modulation amplitude, whereas those at g = 4.3 were recorded with 1-mT modulation amplitude. The relative concentration of the tyrosine radical under different conditions was obtained by comparing the double integral and peak minus troughs of the signals, measured under nonsaturating conditions. To account for background signals (see Fig. 2), the spectra were always compared with a radical-free spectrum, which was produced by incubation of the chelator of interest with the cells for 24 h at 300 µM IBE. In order to assess the degree of error in the measurements, four different peak minus trough values were used to analyze the intensity of the signal (332.5-335.7 mT; 332.5-342.7 mT, 338.0-335.7 mT; 331.7-330.7 mT). A complete double integral was also calculated from 329.8 to 338.2 mT). The values from these five measurements were compared, and the means ± S.D. are recorded in the figures. The signal in the absence of chelator addition was arbitrarily set to 1, and the signal following 24-h incubation with 300 µM IBE of chelators (when no features of the tyrosine radical were detectable) was set to 0. Presentation of the results in this manner is designed to illustrate the errors associated with the EPR analysis (especially at lower radical concentrations), but it should be emphasized that the main findings of this paper were readily discernible by simple visual analysis of the EPR spectra alone (see Fig. 2, Fig. 3).Fig. 3EPR spectra of g = 4.3 region in K562 cells following treatment with iron chelators. EPR details were as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cells were treated for 24 h with the chelators. a, control K562 cells; b, K562 cells + 300 µM DFO; c, 10 µM ferrioxamine standard solution; d, K562 cells + 900 µM CP94; e, 10 µM Fe3+-CP94 standard solution. Microwave frequency was 9.37 GHz.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Absolute quantitation of the tyrosine radical was obtained by reference to a Cu-EDTA standard (1 mM Cu, 10 mM EDTA). Absolute quantitation of the intracellular high spin ferric chelator complex was obtained by comparing the signal size with a standard curve obtained from the addition of 1-50 µM ferrous sulfate to an excess of the chelator. The ferrioxamine signal was sharper than that from Fe3+-CP94 and Fe3+-CP20, but their double integrals were similar if calculated over a wide enough range. They were also equivalent to those seen from the same concentration of ferric transferrin. Therefore, the zero field splittings of these complexes are such that at the temperature of this study (30 K) the states giving the g = 4.3 and the g = 9 signals were virtually equally populated (31Cammack R. Cooper C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 227: 353-384Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). There was no evidence for spin-spin interactions, which can decrease the signal size when metal ions are frozen in ice. Signal:noise ratios were such that concentrations as low as 1 µM iron could be readily detected. The concentration of EPR-detectable iron, of unknown origin, at g = 4.3 in cells incubated in the absence of added chelators was estimated by comparing the double-integral of the signal with a ferrioxamine standard (the underlying assumption being that at 30 K under nonsaturating conditions any differences in the zero field splitting would not lead to significant discrepancies). All experiments were carried out in duplicate, and average values are plotted in the figures. As is the case with mouse cells (22Nyholm S. Mann G.J. Johansson A.G. Bergeron R.J. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26200-26205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the incubation of iron chelators with K562 cells completely removes the signals at g = 2, due to the tyrosine radical of ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 2). Subtraction of the spectrum of the chelator-treated cells from that of the untreated cells reveals a signal with similar hyperfine couplings and microwave power saturation properties to that seen in hydroxyurea-resistant mouse 3T3 cells (13Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human HL60 cells (32Chitamber C.R. Matthaeus W.G. Antholine W.E. Graff K. O'Brien W.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 1930-1936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), confirming the ability of the technique to detect human ribonucleotide reductase in vivo. Similar signals were observed in K562 cell extracts; treatment with excess hydroxyurea removed the signal. The ease of detection of ribonucleotide reductase tyrosine radical in the K562 and HL60 (32Chitamber C.R. Matthaeus W.G. Antholine W.E. Graff K. O'Brien W.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 1930-1936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells suggests that leukemic cell lines overexpress this enzyme. Furthermore, the addition of 2 mM hydroxyurea to the K562 cells for 24 h did not remove the radical signal, demonstrating significant hydroxyurea resistance. The concentration of the radicals in a packed solution of cells (with <10% intercellular volume) was calculated to be 0.22 µM, corresponding to 600,000 molecules/cell. This is significantly higher than that in wild type mouse 3T6 cells and similar to that in TA3H2 mouse cells selected to overproduce ribonucleotide reductase (21Nocentini G. Federici F. Franchetti P. Barzi A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 19-26PubMed Google Scholar). The value is about 15% of the concentration in an overexpressing strain of mouse 3T6 cells (13Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5711-5715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same EPR samples used to determine the tyrosine radical concentration can also be used to determine the intracellular ferric-chelator concentration (Fig. 3). The majority of intracellular iron in K562 cells is present in ferritin in which the spin coupling observed between the iron atoms yields a broad EPR signal that is not readily detectable under these conditions (33Weir M.

However, low molecular weight iron chelates frequently have sharp EPR signals at g = 4.3 (31Cammack R. Cooper C.E.

Acta. 1992; 1156: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the absence of added chelators a small EPR signal is detected at g = 4.3. The intracellular EPR-detectable iron concentration was calculated to be 3.15 ± 1.05 µM (mean ± S.D., n = 12). Analysis of the growth medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum) revealed a similar concentration of EPR-detectable iron. As expected, the iron in the growth medium had similar spectral features to transferrin, but the intracellular signal was different. This latter signal may be in part due to the cellular low molecular weight iron pool; however, other nonheme iron proteins having g = 4.3 signals may also contribute (31Cammack R. Cooper C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 227: 353-384Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The addition of DFO or CP94 to cells greatly increases the size of the intracellular g = 4.3 signal (Fig. 3). This signal has much greater intensity than the radical and represents chelation of intracellular iron from various sources, not just ribonucleotide reductase. Comparison with the pure chelator-iron complexes revealed that the increase was due to the presence of ferrioxamine and Fe3+-CP94 respectively. The cellular signal had identical EPR structure (g value, line shape) to the pure iron-chelate complexes, strongly indicating that the in vivo complexes formed were ferrioxamine and the 3:1 (Fe3+:CP94) complex. These were readily quantitated by comparing the cellular signal with those of the pure complexes. The addition of iron chelators to the cell growth medium, in the presence or absence of cells, did not result in an increase in EPR-detectable iron in the medium, even after 24 h. However, the spectral shape suggested that most of the iron in the case of CP94 (and some of the iron in the case of DFO) was no longer bound to transferrin. At 30 K, EPR signals were also detected from K562 cells at g = 1.92. These did not interfere with the quantitation of either the ferric chelate complexes or the ribonucleotide reductase radical, nor were they affected by iron chelator treatment. They are likely to be from iron-sulfur centers in the mitochondria, probably succinate dehydrogenase and complex I (35Cammack R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 427-436Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Differences were seen between chelators when the time course of enzyme inhibition and intracellular ferric complexes were compared at 100 µM IBE (Fig. 4). With CP94, the radical was removed rapidly (within 4 h), but a much slower decay was observed with DFO (after 4 h over 50% of the signal remained). The kinetics of the radical decay may have been a consequence of the different rates of chelation of the intracellular iron pools in the two cases. Over 10 µM iron is bound t"

Within the ligand-receptor complex, Trk receptor subunits phosphorylate each other in-trans on specific tyrosine residues. Tyrosine autophosphorylation is required for both the catalytic and signaling activities of the Trk receptors (8Obermeier A. Halfter H. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A.

Biol. 1995; 5: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).Within the TrkA catalytic (SH1) domain, three tyrosines (Tyr-670, Tyr-674, and Tyr-675) 2Tyrosine numbering throughout this text is for TrkA that serves as the primary receptor for NGF (15Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Positionally equivalent tyrosines are conserved in the BDNF receptor and NT4/5 receptor (TrkB) and the NT3 receptor (TrkC) (16Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). have been identified as potential phosphorylation sites based on phosphopeptide analysis (12Stephens R. Loeb D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30370-30377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of Tyr-674 within this three-tyrosine cluster may be especially significant. This tyrosine is the positional equivalent of Tyr-1162 within the insulin receptor β subunit. Crystallographic analysis of the insulin receptor β subunit suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-1162 and its positional equivalent in other receptor tyrosine kinases could be the initial event in receptor activation (19Hubbard S. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar).Outside the catalytic domain, three putative phosphorylation sites have been identified. One of these, Tyr-490 in the juxtamembrane domain of TrkA, is an NPXY motif. Tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at this site indicate that tyrosine (and, by implication, tyrosine phosphorylation) at this site is critical for Shc binding and hence for activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling cascade (10Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stephens R. Loeb D. Copeland T. Pawson T. Greene L. Kaplan D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Another site in the carboxyl-terminal tail of TrkA, Tyr-785, has been shown by mutational analysis to play a functional role in binding phospholipase Cγ to activated NGF receptors (8Obermeier A. Halfter H. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Stephens R. Loeb D. Copeland T. Pawson T. Greene L. Kaplan D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A third site at Tyr-751 is a YXXM motif and thus a candidate recognition site for the SH2 adapter protein p85 that is a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (10Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation at Tyr-751 has not been detected in TrkA overexpression systems that do detect phosphorylation at Tyr-490 and Tyr-785 (12Stephens R. Loeb D. Copeland T. Pawson T. Greene L. Kaplan D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 18Guiton M. Gunn-Moore F.J. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30370-30377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is important to note that the tyrosine autophosphorylation events outlined above have not been observed or analyzed in normal neurons. Since Trks are expressed at low abundance levels in neurons, key autophosphorylation sites have been identified by radioactive phosphopeptide mapping of receptors isolated from non-neuronal cells genetically engineered to overexpress Trk protein. Biological functions of these autophosphorylation sites have been confirmed by mutational analysis in established cell lines. This approach has several limitations. First, radioactive labeling is a stress that can, in and of itself, alter the pattern of phosphorylation. Second, overexpression of a tyrosine kinase in systems such as baculovirus can lead to nonphysiological phosphorylation events. Third, mutational analysis demonstrates that a designated tyrosine is important for proper functioning of the Trk receptor; however, it does not prove that the site is phosphorylated in vivo. Finally, it is not known whether autophosphorylation sites identified in this manner are used in actual neurons.We have used an alternative approach (20Epstein R.J. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Bangalore L. Tanner A.J. Laudano A.P. Stern D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11637-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to study the tyrosine phosphorylation of Trks. Using synthetic tyrosine phosphopeptides as immunogens, we generated a panel of antibodies that report the phosphorylation state of individual tyrosines common to the cytoplasmic domain of the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors. We targeted pY-674 and pY-675 in the catalytic domain. As a representative signal generating tyrosine, we targeted pY-490 in the Shc binding site. Using this approach we determined that the phosphorylation state of individual tyrosine sites is not coordinately controlled following ligand binding. The differential time course of the individual phosphorylation state changes has functional ramifications for neurotrophin-mediated signal transduction in neurons.DISCUSSIONA distinguishing characteristic of the Trk receptors is that they have a small cytoplasmic domain, with few potential sites for tyrosine phosphorylation (16Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). For comparison, the receptor for platelet-derived growth factor has 26 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (29Yarden Y. Escobedo J.A. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T.L. Daniels T.O. Tremble P.M. Chen E.Y. Ando M.E. Harkins R.N. Francke U. Fries V.A. Ullrich A. Williams L.T. Nature. 1986; 323: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), whereas TrkA has only 10 (16Lamballe F. Klein R. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 66: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Thus, the Trks are ideal receptors for analyzing individual tyrosine phosphorylation events. We have used a new approach to analyze Trk autophosphorylation sites. The method is sensitive and nonisotopic. It allows us to resolve the sequence of ligand-induced autophosphorylation events at high resolution. Our data establish that tyrosines within the Trk catalytic domain and a site in the juxtamembrane domain are phosphorylated in primary neurons in response to ligand binding. Finally, we show that the individual tyrosines are not coordinately phosphorylated.In response to receptor activation, phosphorylation state changes within the kinase domain precede those within the Shc binding site. The sequence of phosphorylation appears to be an intrinsic property of Trk receptor. Previous studies have demonstrated that the level and duration of Trk phosphorylation vary as a function of receptor number (22Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and the presence of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (30Barker P. Shooter E. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 31Verdi J. Birren S. Ibanez C. Persson H. Kaplan D. Benedetti M. Chao M. Anderson D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 733-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 32Hantzopoulos P. Suri C. Glass D. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G. Neuron. 1994; 13: 187-201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, we have observed similar patterns of phosphorylation in wild type PC12 cells that express p75 and low levels of TrkA (Fig. 6), in PC12 cells genetically engineered to express a 20-fold excess of Trk (Fig. 4), and in 3T3 cells that express TrkA but not the p75 receptor (data not shown).How is this non-coordinate phosphorylation pattern achieved? In principle, differential utilization of tyrosine residues by the Trk tyrosine kinase or differential utilization of phosphotyrosine residues by cellular phosphatases are possible. Our data suggest that both differential kinase and differential phosphatase activity account for the observed pattern. Studies on a closely related receptor tyrosine kinase, the insulin receptor β subunit, suggest that differential utilization of tyrosines 674/675 as substrate contributes to the non-coordinate phosphorylation. In studies using synthetic peptides as substrates for a soluble form of the insulin receptor, phosphorylation of Tyr-1162 was found to proceed to completion before phosphorylation of Tyr-1163 began (33Levine B. Clack B. Ellis L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3565-3570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr-1162 and Tyr-1163 in the insulin receptor β subunit correspond to 674 and 675 in TrkA (34Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). By analogy, differential utilization of tyrosine residues by the Trk receptor tyrosine kinase is likely to account for our data showing that phosphorylation of Tyr-674 proceeds to completion in vivo before other sites are fully phosphorylated.Substrate preferences of the Trk receptor kinase do not fully account for the non-coordinate pattern of phosphorylation state changes. We used the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate to investigate the role of phosphatases in the observed pattern. As shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, while the activation loop sites are rapidly dephosphorylated after stimulation, phosphorylation at the Shc binding site persists for a longer time. This rapid dephosphorylation of the kinase domain sites can be prevented by vanadate (Fig. 5), suggesting that specific tyrosine phosphatases preferentially dephosphorylate the kinase domain sites.The sequence in which the kinase domain sites and the Shc binding site are phosphorylated may explain the mechanism by which Trk kinase activity is induced following ligand binding. As shown in Fig. 6, the phosphorylation state of the kinase domain sites Tyr-674/Tyr-675 tracks closely with tyrosine kinase activity. This correlation can be interpreted in the context of crystallographic analysis of a related receptor tyrosine kinase. Crystallographic analysis of the insulin receptor β subunit places Tyr-1162 (the positional equivalent of Tyr-674 in TrkA) within a flexible activation loop of amino acids lying near the cleft between the amino-terminal, ATP binding, and the carboxyl-terminal, substrate binding lobes of the kinase (19Hubbard S. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) . A model proposed by Hubbard et al. (19Hubbard S. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) suggests that the activation loop exists in a thermodynamic equilibrium between two conformations. When Tyr-1162 is phosphorylated, the preferred conformation of the activation loop exposes the ATP and substrate binding sites. When Tyr-1162 is dephosphorylated, the preferred conformation of the activation loop occludes the ATP and substrate binding sites, and so decreases enzymatic activity. This model for ligand-induced tyrosine kinase activation predicts that phosphorylation at the critical tyrosines in the activation loop (Tyr-1162/Tyr-1163 for insulin receptor and the corresponding Tyr-674/Tyr-675 for TrkA) would be the initial event in ligand-induced receptor activation and that phosphorylation state of these critical tyrosines would correspond with the level of tyrosine kinase activity. Our data, presented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Table I, show that this is indeed the case. The relationship between phosphorylation state of Tyr-674/Tyr-675 and Trk enzymatic activity also sheds light on previous studies with the Trk oncogene. Amino acid substitutions at Tyr-674 or Tyr-675 in the oncogene decreased transforming capacity and in vitro kinase activity (35Mitra G. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2237-2241PubMed Google Scholar).Phosphorylation at the Tyr-490 site does not correlate with kinase activity (Fig. 6). Instead, the prolonged phosphorylation at the Shc binding site provides an explanation for neurotrophin-dependent sustained activation of Ras, MEK (MAP kinase/Erk kinase), and MAP kinase (36Rosen L. Ginty D. Weber M. Greenberg M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1207-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 37Qiu M. Green S.

Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 39Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 40Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that transient activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway is mitogenic, while sustained activation has a differentiating effect on PC12 cells (37Qiu M. Green S. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 40Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar, 41Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the duration of activation of this pathway reflects prolonged phosphorylation of a specific site on the Trk receptor. Thus the kinetics of MAP kinase activation reflects intrinsic properties of the receptors themselves.Why should Trk receptors have prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling sites, such as the SHC binding site? Perhaps this reflects the special requirements of signal transduction within a neuron. Target-derived neurotrophins bind to and activate Trk receptors present on nerve terminals. However, many cellular responses including survival and neurite elongation require changes in gene expression. Prolonged phosphorylation at sites critical for regulating gene expression may enable the signal to be conveyed along the distance of an axon. INTRODUCTIONThe neurotrophins are a family of soluble peptide factors that can trigger a wide diversity of biological responses in susceptible cells, including proliferation, commitment, differentiation, and survival (1Korsching S.

This tyrosine is the positional equivalent of Tyr-1162 within the insulin receptor β subunit. Crystallographic analysis of the insulin receptor β subunit suggests that phosphorylation of Tyr-1162 and its positional equivalent in other receptor tyrosine kinases could be the initial event in receptor activation (19Hubbard S. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar).Outside the catalytic domain, three putative phosphorylation sites have been identified. One of these, Tyr-490 in the juxtamembrane domain of TrkA, is an NPXY motif. Tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions at this site indicate that tyrosine (and, by implication, tyrosine phosphorylation) at this site is critical for Shc binding and hence for activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling cascade (10Obermeier A.

Kaplan D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Another site in the carboxyl-terminal tail of TrkA, Tyr-785, has been shown by mutational analysis to play a functional role in binding phospholipase Cγ to activated NGF receptors (8Obermeier A. Halfter H. Wiesmuller K.-H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Stephens R. Loeb D. Copeland T. Pawson T. Greene L. Kaplan D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A third site at Tyr-751 is a YXXM motif and thus a candidate recognition site for the SH2 adapter protein p85 that is a component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (10Obermeier A. Lammers R. Wiesmuller K. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22963-22966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation at Tyr-751 has not been detected in TrkA overexpression systems that do detect phosphorylation at Tyr-490 and Tyr-785 (12Stephens R. Loeb D. Copeland T. Pawson T. Greene L. Kaplan D. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 18Guiton M. Gunn-Moore F.J. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30370-30377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).It is important to note that the tyrosine autophosphorylation events outlined above have not been observed or analyzed in normal neurons. Since Trks are expressed at low abundance levels in neurons, key autophosphorylation sites have been identified by radioactive phosphopeptide mapping of receptors isolated from non-neuronal cells genetically engineered to overexpress Trk protein. Biological functions of these autophosphorylation sites have been confirmed by mutational analysis in established cell lines. This approach has several limitations. First, radioactive labeling is a stress that can, in and of itself, alter the pattern of phosphorylation. Second, overexpression of a tyrosine kinase in systems such as baculovirus can lead to nonphysiological phosphorylation events. Third, mutational analysis demonstrates that a designated tyrosine is important for proper functioning of the Trk receptor; however, it does not prove that the site is phosphorylated in vivo. Finally, it is not known whether autophosphorylation sites identified in this manner are used in actual neurons.We have used an alternative approach (20Epstein R.J. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Bangalore L. Tanner A.J. Laudano A.P. Stern D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11637-11641Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) to study the tyrosine phosphorylation of Trks. Using synthetic tyrosine phosphopeptides as immunogens, we generated a panel of antibodies that report the phosphorylation state of individual tyrosines common to the cytoplasmic domain of the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors. We targeted pY-674 and pY-675 in the catalytic domain. As a representative signal generating tyrosine, we targeted pY-490 in the Shc binding site. Using this approach we determined that the phosphorylation state of individual tyrosine sites is not coordinately controlled following ligand binding. The differential time course of the individual phosphorylation state changes has functional ramifications for neurotrophin-mediated signal transduction in neurons."

Weightman A.L. Slater J.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 1755-1762PubMed Google Scholar). L-2-Haloacid dehalogenases (L-DEXs) 1The abbreviations used are: L-DEXL-2-haloacid dehalogenaseL-DEX YLL-2-haloacid dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp. YLHALhaloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10CHSaseN-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase from Arthrobactor sp.Wat-501water molecule labeled 501. have been isolated from several strains and most extensively studied. L-DEXs are very similar to one another in their primary structures (8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu T.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ.

Kurihara T. Esaki N. Soda K. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1994; 58: 1599-1602Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The enzyme (L-DEX YL) has been purified to homogeneity and characterized physicochemically (1Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Hasan A.K.M.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its structural gene has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli (8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu T.-Q. Koshikawa H.

Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of 232 amino acid residues whose sequence has been deduced from the gene sequence, and its molecular weight is 26,179 (8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu T.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme shows several characteristic properties (1Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Hasan A.K.M.Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It acts not only on L-2-haloalkanoic acids with short carbon chains (2-5 carbons) in aqueous solution but also on long chain substrates with up to 16 carbons in organic solvent. Thus the enzyme is useful for the production of various D-2-hydroxyalkanoic acids, which are important as starting materials in the chemical industry. In addition, it is highly thermostable and is not inactivated at all by incubation at 60°C for 30 min. Its optimum temperature is 65°C. The catalytic mechanism of L-DEX YL has been studied by comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis (12Kurihara T. Liu J.-Q. Nardi-Dei V. Koshikawa H. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), 18O incorporation (13Liu J.-Q. Kurihara T. Miyagi M. Esaki N. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18309-18312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and chemical modification with hydroxylamine. 2J.-Q. Liu, T. Kurihara, M. Miyagi, S. Tsunasawa, M. Nishihara, N. Esaki, and K. Soda, submitted for publication. These studies revealed that Asp-10, Thr-14, Arg-41, Ser-118, Lys-151, Tyr-157, Ser-175, Asn-177, and Asp-180 are important for the enzymatic activity, and that Asp-10 plays an essential role as a nucleophile in the enzymatic reaction. Consequently, the following mechanism is proposed for the hydrolytic reaction. The reaction probably starts with a nucleophilic attack by Asp-10 on the α-carbon of the substrate to form an ester intermediate, followed by the hydrolysis of the intermediate by an activated water molecule, and ends with the release of the product and the simultaneous regeneration of the intact enzyme. To confirm this proposal and to obtain a more detailed description of the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme, it is indispensable to investigate at atomic level how the catalytic residues are arranged in the active site of L-DEX YL in order to interact with the substrate molecule.The crystal structure of haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 (HAL) is the only structure of dehalogenase that is available at atomic resolution (14Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Verschueren K.H.G. Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that leads to a proposal of the reaction mechanism based on the crystal structures of the enzyme-substrate complex under two different conditions (16Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). HAL is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family, which has a common characteristic fold comprising an eight-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices and catalytic triad residues on the topologically and sterically equivalent loci on the specific turns and loop: the nucleophile elbow, the acidic turn, and the histidine loop (17Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). The catalytic triad occurs in the primary structure in the invariant order of Nu-Ac-His, where Nu is a nucleophile and Ac is an acidic amino acid residue. The nucleophile elbow has a consensus sequence of Sm-X-Nu-X-Sm-Sm, where Sm is a small amino acid residue and X is an arbitrary residue. Although L-DEXs catalyze a hydrolysis similar to that catalyzed by HAL, L-DEXs show low sequence similarity with HAL (8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu T.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and do not seem to have a similar catalytic triad in the order Nu-Ac-His. Therefore, it seems difficult to predict the roles of the catalytic residues of L-DEXs other than Asp-10, based on the comparison with HAL, although L-DEXs have active site nucleophiles and their reactions proceed via ester intermediates, as HAL does.In order to elucidate the mechanisms of catalysis and stereoselectivity of L-DEXs, we have determined the crystal structure of L-DEX YL at 2.5 Å resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement. This is the first report on the tertiary structure of the L-DEX family.

Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Verschueren K.H.G. Franken S.M. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 856-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that leads to a proposal of the reaction mechanism based on the crystal structures of the enzyme-substrate complex under two different conditions (16Verschueren K.H.G. Seljée F. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Nature. 1993; 363: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). HAL is a member of the α/β hydrolase fold family, which has a common characteristic fold comprising an eight-stranded parallel β-sheet flanked by α-helices and catalytic triad residues on the topologically and sterically equivalent loci on the specific turns and loop: the nucleophile elbow, the acidic turn, and the histidine loop (17Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). The catalytic triad occurs in the primary structure in the invariant order of Nu-Ac-His, where Nu is a nucleophile and Ac is an acidic amino acid residue. The nucleophile elbow has a consensus sequence of Sm-X-Nu-X-Sm-Sm, where Sm is a small amino acid residue and X is an arbitrary residue. Although L-DEXs catalyze a hydrolysis similar to that catalyzed by HAL, L-DEXs show low sequence similarity with HAL (8Nardi-Dei V. Kurihara T. Okamura T. Liu T.-Q. Koshikawa H. Ozaki H. Terashima Y. Esaki N. Soda K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and do not seem to have a similar catalytic triad in the order Nu-Ac-His. Therefore, it seems difficult to predict the roles of the catalytic residues of L-DEXs other than Asp-10, based on the comparison with HAL, although L-DEXs have active site nucleophiles and their reactions proceed via ester intermediates, as HAL does.In order to elucidate the mechanisms of catalysis and stereoselectivity of L-DEXs, we have determined the crystal structure of L-DEX YL at 2.5 Å resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement. This is the first report on the tertiary structure of the L-DEX family. Halogenated organic compounds are widely used as materials for various industrial products such as insecticides and solvents and cause serious environmental problems owing to their persistence and/or toxicity.

It acts not only on L-2-haloalkanoic acids with short carbon chains (2-5 carbons) in aqueous solution but also on long chain substrates with up to 16 carbons in organic solvent.

In addition, it is highly thermostable and is not inactivated at all by incubation at 60°C for 30 min. Its optimum temperature is 65°C.

These studies revealed that Asp-10, Thr-14, Arg-41, Ser-118, Lys-151, Tyr-157, Ser-175, Asn-177, and Asp-180 are important for the enzymatic activity, and that Asp-10 plays an essential role as a nucleophile in the enzymatic reaction. Consequently, the following mechanism is proposed for the hydrolytic reaction. The reaction probably starts with a nucleophilic attack by Asp-10 on the α-carbon of the substrate to form an ester intermediate, followed by the hydrolysis of the intermediate by an activated water molecule, and ends with the release of the product and the simultaneous regeneration of the intact enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2008588972,"Myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by activated phagocytes, may be a catalyst for lipoprotein oxidation in vivo. Active myeloperoxidase is a component of human atherosclerotic lesions, and atherosclerotic tissue exhibits selective enrichment of protein dityrosine cross-links, a well characterized product of myeloperoxidase. Tyrosylation of lipoproteins with peroxidase-generated tyrosyl radical generates multiple protein-bound tyrosine oxidation products in addition to dityrosine. The structural characterization of these products would thus serve as an important step in determining the role of myeloperoxidase in lipoprotein oxidation in the artery wall. We now report the identification and characterization of four distinct tyrosyl radical addition products generated by human phagocytes. Activated neutrophils synthesized three major fluorescent products from L-tyrosine; on reverse phase HPLC, each compound coeluted with fluorescent oxidation products formed by myeloperoxidase. We purified the oxidation products to apparent homogeneity by cation and anion exchange chromatographies and identified the compounds as dityrosine (3,3′-dityrosine), trityrosine (3,3′,5′,3′-trityrosine) and pulcherosine (5-[4′-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)phenoxy]3,3′-dityrosine) by high resolution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Additionally, we have found that dityrosine is a precursor to trityrosine, but not pulcherosine. In a search for a precursor to pulcherosine, we identified isodityrosine (3-[4′-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)phenoxy]tyrosine), a non-fluorescent product of L-tyrosine oxidation by human phagocytes. Our results represent the first identification of this family of tyrosyl radical addition products in a mammalian system. Moreover, these compounds may serve as markers specific for tyrosyl radical-mediated oxidative damage in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory conditions."

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This class of receptors comprises integral membrane proteins that transmit signals into cells in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli such as hormones of a variety of structures, from monoamines to large peptides, and even light or ions. The particular receptors are predicted to have seven transmembrane regions and are believed to interchange between a number of different conformations that can selectively bind agonist or antagonist ligands and activate G proteins with important functional consequences (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 3Rosenkilde M.M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors exploit diverse strategies for ligand recognition, using either the transmembrane domain, the extracellular surface, or even the N-terminal segment. Detailed structural information is important to the understanding of the mechanisms of ligand recognition and activation of G protein-coupled receptors and in the design of therapeutic agents. Obtaining insight into the three-dimensional structure of these receptors represents a formidable task because of the difficulties of obtaining and purifying sufficiently large amounts of protein to produce crystals for high resolution x-ray or electron diffraction. Novel biochemical and biophysical methods are needed not only to overcome the hurdle to explore the molecular architecture of receptors (4Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 566-573Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 5Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8812-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) but also for investigating the dynamics of their interaction with ligands.One powerful approach is the investigation of extrinsic fluorophores incorporated at known sites in the receptor or ligand by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescent labels serve as sensitive indicators of the microenvironment at a given residue as well as structural changes in receptor (6Turcatti G. Vogel H. Chollet A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Time-resolved techniques will permit the study of the structural changes to which a given residue might be submitted during receptor activation in a native membrane environment. Finally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor pair located in the receptor and the ligand will permit intermolecular distances between these labels to be estimated.Introducing fluorescent groups at specific sites in G protein-coupled receptors presents a major challenge. Classical methods such as solid-phase synthesis or chemical modification of reactive side chains have been used in vitro to incorporate unnatural biophysical probes into proteins but few of these approaches are suitable for large membrane proteins (9Ridge K.D. Zhang C. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8804-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the recent years, expansion of the genetic code by suppression of the nonsense stop codon UAG has been developed for the site-directed incorporation of a variety of unnatural amino acids with novel properties into proteins in vitro in cell-free systems (10Cornish V.W. Mendel D. Schultz P.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 621-633Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Bain J.D. Diala E.S. Glabe C.G. Wacker D.A. Lyttle M.H. Dix T.A. Chamberlin A.R.

Only recently has this been extended to heterologous expression of membrane proteins in an intact cell system: the Xenopus oocyte (13Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C.G.

Science. 1995; 268: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).Here we report a novel biophysical approach for understanding the structure and function of a representative G protein-coupled receptor, the tachykinin NK2 receptor. This approach combines the biosynthetic incorporation of extrinsic fluorescent reporter groups into proteins in intact cells with the widely employed technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (14Förster T. Ann. Physiol. (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4844) Google Scholar, 15Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) for distance measurements. Here we use these experimentally determined distances to build a model for the interaction of a peptide ligand with NK2 in a native membrane environment.DISCUSSIONIn this study we present a novel fluorescence spectroscopic approach to obtain structural information on integral membrane proteins as demonstrated for the NK2 neurokinin G protein-coupled receptor. The aim was to use FRET techniques between a fluorescent donor group engineered in the NK2 receptor at known sites, and an acceptor fluorophore in the ligand, for the determination of a structural model for interaction of a peptide ligand with NK2.Site-specific fluorescent labeling of NK2 was accomplished in intact cells by suppression of TAG nonsense codon placed at known sites in NK2 using a suppressor tRNA aminoacylated with the fluorescent L-amino acid analogue NBD-Dap. The key steps in this approach are: 1) the mutation of a selected site in NK2 cDNA to TAG termination codon and the preparation of the cognate cRNA transcript containing the UAG codon; 2) the construction by chemical and enzymatic methods of a misacylated suppressor tRNA that recognize the UAG stop codon and functions biosynthetically as a source of unnatural amino acid; and 3) the heterologous expression of receptor containing unnatural amino acids in Xenopus oocytes. The oocyte cell translation machinery recognizes the exogeneous aminoacylated suppressor tRNA and incorporates the fluorescent residue into the nascent protein at sites preselected by creation of a nonsense codon in the gene. To improve the efficiency of the incorporation, we designed and constructed a synthetic UAG suppressor tRNA (Sup-tRNA-NBD, Fig. 1) derived from yeast tRNA(Phe). This contained the anticodon CUA that recognizes the UAG stop mutation in the cRNA. The fluorescent amino acid NBD-Dap was acylated chemically to the 3′-end and two mutations (G20U and A73G) were introduced to reduce the rate of reacylation with natural amino acids by endogeneous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (28Bruce A.G. Atkins J.F. Wills N. Uhlenbeck O. Gesteland R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7127-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 243: 1363-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). UAG was chosen as a stop codon for controlled suppression because of its low usage as a natural termination codon in oocytes (17%), compared to UAA (36%) or UGA (47%) (32Cherry J.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The yields of suppression were in the 10-30% range. We never detected NBD fluorescence in membranes prepared from oocytes injected with the fluorescent Sup-tRNA-NBD only. This suggests that suppression of UAG stop codons naturally occurring in oocytes by the exogeneously added suppressor tRNA was insignificant in the context of this study.The functional activity of NK2 and fluorescent suppression mutants (Fig. 2) was assayed by activation of Ca2+-dependent chloride currents (24Nemeth K. Chollet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27601-27605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Harada Y. Takahashi Kuno M. Nakyama K. Masu Y. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3265-3273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minor differences observed among the chloride currents profiles represent the degree of variability of response that is normally seen in oocytes. Similar oocyte to oocyte variations were observed for wild type NK2 in the same batch. The data demonstrate that functional NK2 mutant receptors, containing the unnatural NBD-Dap amino acid at either position 103 or 248, were synthesized by oocytes. The only detectable difference between suppression mutants and wild type receptor was the latency of onset of chloride channel opening (Fig. 3) which probably reflects the differences in expression level.Fluorescent NK2 receptors in oocyte membranes were further characterized by saturation binding analysis with the specific NK2 antagonist PhCO-(δ-125I-phenol-3-propionyl)-Orn-Ala-D-Trp-Phe-D-Pro-Pro-Nle-NH2. Kd values for binding of this ligand to oocyte membrane fractions were comparable for wild-type NK2 and R103NBD and F248NBD mutants. Moreover, these Kd values were comparable to those obtained for NK2 receptor stably expressed in CHO cells (Table I), thus indicating that the structural integrity of the mutants was conserved.Fluorescent labels placed at known sites can monitor conformational changes in receptors in response to ligand binding. In that respect, position 248 in the C-terminal part of the third intracellular loop of NK2 is particularly interesting as this region has been shown to be involved in receptor activation and G protein coupling for other 7-transmembrane receptors (38Burstein E.S. Spalding T.A. Hill-Eubanks D. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3141-3146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 39Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We observed no change in the fluorescence of mutant F248NBD during binding of either agonist or antagonist (Fig. 5). Without totally ruling out that this region undergoes conformational change during receptor functioning, this however indicates that there is no detectable change in the hydrophobicity around site 248 because NBD fluorescence depends strongly on the polarity of its environment.Evidence for fluorescence energy transfer was provided by quenching of the NBD-labeled receptor (donor) fluorescence. This quenching was used to quantify the energy transfer because, under the conditions of measurement, there was no evidence for other deactivation process of NBD fluorescence. An important factor influencing the FRET experiments and their interpretation is the dipole orientation factor κ2. In theory, this factor can take any value between 0 and 4. κ2 can be precisely determined only if the positions of the two fluorescent molecules is fixed and known. When the energy donor is free to rotate and the energy acceptor is fixed, κ2 can range from 1/3 compared to 4/3 depending on the angle between the transition moment of the acceptor and the donor-acceptor separation vector (15Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). The error on the calculated R0 due to the uncertainty in the value of κ2 in this range is ±11%. We are making this assumption in the experiments described in this study. From the steady state fluorescence anisotropy experiments, we can deduce that the TMR-labeled ligand bound to NK2 is immobilized. Also it is reasonable to assume that residues 103 and 248 located in loops connecting membrane-spanning domains have some freedom to rotate.In previous spectrofluorometric observations and collisional quenching experiments from our laboratory (6Turcatti G. Vogel H. Chollet A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) we have shown that the antagonist heptapeptide ligand binds the wild type receptor in a hydrophobic pocket on the extracellular side of the transmembrane segments and that the fluorophore is located at the membrane-water interface. The distance between the bound TMR ligand and position 248 estimated by FRET is consistent with a seven transmembrane topology for the NK2 receptor and provides an experimental validation of this model. The membrane bilayer can be viewed as a hydrophobic core region of about 30 Å flanked by two interfacial regions of about 15 Å each (40White S.H. Wimley W.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 79-86Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The acceptor and donor fluorophores are predicted in the interfacial areas on opposite sides of the membrane. Residues Gln109, Cys167, His198, and Gly273 around the extracellular side of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth transmembrane segments, respectively, were found to be critical for peptide antagonist binding to NK2. 2N. Bhogal, D. Donnelly, and J. B. C. Findlay, manuscript submitted for publication. By placing the NK2 residue 248 on the cytoplasmic face, residue 103 in the first extracellular loop, and taking into account the measured FRET distances with the TMR peptide, the position of the ligand becomes defined in space. This consideration resulted in the three-dimensional model of NK2 in Fig. 8 using the projection structure of rhodopsin as a general basis for the G protein-coupled receptors folding (27Schertler G. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). To refine this model, we integrated the FRET experimental distances with the other constraints. Fig. 8 shows the most probable orientation for the fluorescent heptapeptide antagonist bound to NK2, in the context of this model. The fluorescent TMR group lies outside of the bundle formed by the seven membrane spanning domain. Insertion of the peptide ligand between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains suggests that antagonism may be caused by preventing correct packing of the helices required for receptor activation. Future measurement of FRET distances between the fluorescent ligand, or an analogue labeled at a different position, and other labeled sites in NK2 will permit further refining of this model.In conclusion, we presented the first report of the introduction of fluorescent probes at specific sites in a membrane receptor in intact cells by unnatural suppression mutagenesis. We also showed that these labeled receptors can be used to measure intermolecular distances between these sites and bound ligands. By placing the fluorescent probe to different sites in the receptor, it will be possible to improve the structural model of the receptor and its ligands in a native membrane environment. In the future, time-resolved fluorescent measurements will permit the study of rapid dynamic changes in the receptor structure (34Lakowicz J.R. Gryczynski I. Wiczk W. Laczko G. Prendergast F.C.

These methods can now be generally applied to understand the molecular architecture and conformational changes of integral membrane proteins such as channels or receptors as well as to protein-protein or ligand-protein interactions.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This class of receptors comprises integral membrane proteins that transmit signals into cells in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli such as hormones of a variety of structures, from monoamines to large peptides, and even light or ions. The particular receptors are predicted to have seven transmembrane regions and are believed to interchange between a number of different conformations that can selectively bind agonist or antagonist ligands and activate G proteins with important functional consequences (2Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, 3Rosenkilde M.M. Cahir M. Gether U. Hjorth S.A. Schwartz T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28160-28164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptors exploit diverse strategies for ligand recognition, using either the transmembrane domain, the extracellular surface, or even the N-terminal segment. Detailed structural information is important to the understanding of the mechanisms of ligand recognition and activation of G protein-coupled receptors and in the design of therapeutic agents. Obtaining insight into the three-dimensional structure of these receptors represents a formidable task because of the difficulties of obtaining and purifying sufficiently large amounts of protein to produce crystals for high resolution x-ray or electron diffraction. Novel biochemical and biophysical methods are needed not only to overcome the hurdle to explore the molecular architecture of receptors (4Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 566-573Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 5Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8812-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) but also for investigating the dynamics of their interaction with ligands.One powerful approach is the investigation of extrinsic fluorophores incorporated at known sites in the receptor or ligand by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescent labels serve as sensitive indicators of the microenvironment at a given residue as well as structural changes in receptor (6Turcatti G. Vogel H. Chollet A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3972-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Fay S.P. Domalewski M.D. Sklar L.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28268-28275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Time-resolved techniques will permit the study of the structural changes to which a given residue might be submitted during receptor activation in a native membrane environment. Finally, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor pair located in the receptor and the ligand will permit intermolecular distances between these labels to be estimated.Introducing fluorescent groups at specific sites in G protein-coupled receptors presents a major challenge. Classical methods such as solid-phase synthesis or chemical modification of reactive side chains have been used in vitro to incorporate unnatural biophysical probes into proteins but few of these approaches are suitable for large membrane proteins (9Ridge K.D. Zhang C. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8804-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the recent years, expansion of the genetic code by suppression of the nonsense stop codon UAG has been developed for the site-directed incorporation of a variety of unnatural amino acids with novel properties into proteins in vitro in cell-free systems (10Cornish V.W. Mendel D. Schultz P.G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 621-633Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 11Bain J.D. Diala E.S. Glabe C.G. Wacker D.A. Lyttle M.H. Dix T.A. Chamberlin A.R.

Only recently has this been extended to heterologous expression of membrane proteins in an intact cell system: the Xenopus oocyte (13Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C.G.

This approach combines the biosynthetic incorporation of extrinsic fluorescent reporter groups into proteins in intact cells with the widely employed technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (14Förster T. Ann. Physiol. (Leipzig). 1948; 2: 55-75Crossref Scopus (4844) Google Scholar, 15Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) for distance measurements.

https://openalex.org/W2011494098,"Tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins type B and G are zinc-endopeptidases of remarkable specificity. They recognize and cleave a synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin, an essential protein component of the vesicle docking and fusion apparatus. VAMP contains two copies of a nine-residue motif, also present in SNAP-25 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa) and syntaxin, the two other substrates of clostridial neurotoxins. This motif was suggested to be a determinant of the target specificity of neurotoxins. Antibodies raised against this motif cross-react among VAMP, SNAP-25, and syntaxin and inhibit the proteolytic activity of the neurotoxins. Moreover, the various neurotoxins cross-inhibit each other's proteolytic action. The role of the three negatively charged residues of the motif in neurotoxin recognition was probed by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of acidic residues in both copies of the VAMP motif indicate that the first one is involved in tetanus neurotoxin recognition, whereas the second one is implicated in binding botulinum B and G neurotoxins. These results suggest that the two copies of the motif have a tandem association in the VAMP molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2104293738,"The initial step in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the estrogen receptor (ER) is the binding of hormone. Previous studies have suggested that the region between amino acids 515 and 535 near the C terminus of the human ER is likely to be important in ligand binding. In order to explicitly define which amino acids in this region are critical for ligand recognition and binding, we have utilized alanine-scanning mutagenesis over the complete 515-535 region. The ability of these 21 mutants to activate transcription in response to the natural estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), was evaluated in cell co-transfection assays with estrogen-responsive reporter genes. In addition, their ability to bind E2 was also tested. Mutations at four sites in the 521-528 region had the greatest effects on E2-induced transcription, with L525A reducing responsiveness 250-fold, G521A and H524A 35-fold, and M528A 11-fold. Mutations at other sites had either no effect or a 4-fold or lesser reduction in sensitivity to E2 (M517A, Y526A, N532A, and P535A). Three of the mutants most affected in their transcriptional response, G521A, H524A, and M528A, showed a coordinate reduction in E2 binding affinity. E2 binding by the most affected mutant, L525A, could not be detected. Thus, the altered transcriptional response of these ER mutants appears to derive solely from an alteration in their affinity for the ligand E2. The four sites most affected by alanine substitution, 521, 524, 525, and 528, follow an α-helical periodicity, such that they would be positioned on one face of an α-helix. Furthermore, they correspond precisely to residues in an α-helix shown to be in contact with ligand in the recently described x-ray crystal structures of two other members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, namely the retinoic acid receptor- and thyroid hormone receptor-ligand complexes. Our findings, which broaden observations to the steroid receptor family within the superfamily of nuclear receptors, suggest that this region of the estrogen receptor is in contact with its cognate ligand in a similar fashion.

These data suggest that myristoylation is required for specific targeting of Gpa1p to the plasma membrane, where it is needed to interact with the receptor and to regulate the release of Gβγ. The actions of many extracellular stimuli (hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, light) are elicited by signaling cascades that involve a membrane-bound receptor, a regulatory G protein composed of three subunits (α, β, γ), and an effector that propagates the signal. Upon receptor activation, the G protein α subunit releases GDP, binds GTP, and dissociates from the Gβγ subunit complex. The G protein remains in the active dissociated state until GTP is hydrolyzed. In yeast, most components of this signaling cascade were discovered genetically, through gene mutations that block pheromone signaling and mating. Disruption of genes encoding Gβ (STE4) or Gγ (STE18) result in a sterile phenotype. Loss of Gα (GPA1, also known as SCG1) leads to constitutive signaling and mating even in the absence of pheromone. Thus it appears that Gβγ activates the downstream signaling pathway, and the primary role of Gpa1p is to regulate the levels of free Gβγ in the cell (1Kurjan J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1097-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Whiteway M.S. Cunle W. Leeuw T. Clark K. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E.

In order to respond to extracellular signals, G proteins and receptors must associate with the plasma membrane of the cell. Since G proteins are not integral membrane proteins, however, it is not clear how they become attached to the lipid bilayer or how they are targeted specifically to the plasma membrane. One mechanism for controlling protein localization is post-translational modification (4Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that all G protein α subunits undergo some form of fatty acylation. Gsα, Giα, Gqα, G12α, G13α, Goα, and Gzα are palmitoylated (5Parenti M. Vigano M.A. Newman C.M.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), result in constitutive activation of the pheromone response pathway. Thus nonmyristoylated Gpa1p appears unable to bind Gβγ in vivo, even though it remains associated with the cell membrane (11Stone D.E. Cole G.M. de Barros Lopes M. Goebl M. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The ability of myristoylated or nonmyristoylated Gpa1p to bind Gβγ has never been documented, however. Moreover, while nonmyristoylated Gpa1p sediments with the membrane fraction, the type of membrane was never defined (11Stone D.E. Cole G.M. de Barros Lopes M. Goebl M. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus it is not known if myristoylation is necessary for high affinity binding to Gβγ, or for specific binding to the plasma membrane, or both. For example, Gpa1p could be recruited to the plasma membrane via myristoylation-dependent coupling to Gβγ. Conversely, Gpa1p might require myristoylation to reach the plasma membrane, and consequently is able to interact with other plasma membrane proteins such as Gβγ or the receptor. Previous studies have revealed a possible role for Gβγ in targeting Gα to the plasma membrane. Sternweis (23Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 631-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that binding of purified Goα and Giα to lipid vesicles requires co-reconstitution with Gβγ, suggesting that Gβγ can serve as a membrane anchor for the α subunit in mammalian cells. However, other proteins must also be involved since expression of Gα in excess of Gβγ does not prevent membrane association (24Simonds W.F. Collins R.M. Spiegel A.M. Brann M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and disruption of the G protein β and γ genes in yeast (STE4, STE18) does not lead to solubilization of Gpa1p (25Blumer K.J. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Again, the type of membrane was not defined in these experiments, so they do not reveal whether Gβγ can direct Gα to a specific cell membrane compartment. Past studies have also revealed several functional changes associated with the myristoylation of G proteins. For example, myristoylation of Giα promotes binding to Gβγ, direct inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in vitro, as well as binding to cell membranes (16Mumby S.M. Heukeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G.

Myristoylated peptides corresponding to the N-terminal domain of Gtα were found to inhibit binding to Gβγ. In these experiments, a random myristoylated peptide was also an effective inhibitor, suggesting that the lipid moiety can play an important role in Gβγ recognition (14Kokame K. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nature. 1992; 359: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 15Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S. Hurley J.B. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18274-18277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Less direct experiments (e.g. N-terminal deletions or proteolysis) have yielded similar conclusions (reviewed in Ref. 30Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). More recently, Chabre and colleagues have proposed an alternative model for how Gα myristoylation contributes to subunit and membrane interactions. They showed that tight association of purified subunits requires the presence of lipids or detergent, suggesting that acylation contributes indirectly to subunit interaction by restricting their mobility to the two-dimensional plane of the membrane or micelle (31Bigay J. Faurobert E. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These experiments were possible because of the unique ability of Gt to be solubilized even in the absence of detergent. We reasoned that the G protein in yeast would also be useful in this regard, because of the unusual ability of Gpa1p to remain membrane associated even when myristoylation is blocked (11Stone D.E. Cole G.M. de Barros Lopes M. Goebl M. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1969-1981Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus a direct role for myristoylation in subunit binding can be examined without the confounding effects of membrane dissociation. Moreover, strains that bear disruption mutations of G protein subunits are available, so a role for Gβγ expression in Gα trafficking can be tested directly. In this report, we investigate the role of myristoylation in G protein subunit and membrane interactions. These experiments reveal that Gβγ binds to myristoylated and nonmyristoylated Gpa1p with similar affinity, but that myristoylation is required for Gpa1p to reach the plasma membrane where Gβγ is normally located. These findings reveal a role for myristoylation in G protein subcellular localization and highlight the importance of proper membrane localization for normal G protein function. Standard methods for the growth and maintenance of yeast and bacteria were used throughout (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain DH 5α was used for the maintenance of plasmids. Yeast cells were grown in synthetic medium supplemented with amino acids, adenine, and 2% glucose (SCD) or 2% galactose plus 0.2% sucrose (SCG); uracil or leucine were omitted to maintain selection for plasmids. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study were YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801am ade2-101oc trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1), YPH501 (YPH499 MATa/α) (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P.

JGY11 (MATa ste11ts LEU2 ura3-52 lys2 ade2oc trp1 his−) (35Dohlman H.G. Goldsmith P. Spiegel A.M. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The diploid cells were transformed with pBSH/E-GPA1-hisG (XbaI-digested) and sporulated. pBSH/E-GPA1-hisG consists of pBluescript (lacking the EcoRI-HindIII sites), and the XbaI-XbaI fragment of GPA1 (−93 to +1560, from pG1501) (36Miyajima I.

Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Haploid progeny containing the gpa1::hisG-URA3 disruption were selected on SCD-uracil plates. The ste11ts genotype was tested by growing cells at 24 and 34°C. At 24°C, cells will not grow because of the gpa1Δ mutation which results in constitutive signaling; whereas at 34°C cells will grow because the mating pathway is blocked at ste11. The MATa genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (38Huxley C. Green E.D. Dunham I. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The ura3 genotype was obtained by selection on 5-fluoroorotic acid-containing plates (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Standard methods for the manipulation of DNA were used throughout (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). Enzymes and buffers were obtained from New England Biolabs. PCR reagents were from Perkin-Elmer. Sequencing reagents were purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Expression plasmids used in this study were pRS316 (ampr, CEN/ARS, URA3), or pRS316-ADH (pRS316 with ADH1 promoter and terminator from pAD4M, described below) (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or pRS316-GAL. A double epitope tagged version of GPA1 in pBluescript (Stratagene) (pBSH/E-GPA1-myc) was constructed by ligation of two annealed synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-A GCT GAA GAA CAA AAA TTA ATT TCT GAA GAA GAT TTA AA-3′) and the complementary strand (5′-CTT CTT GTT TTT AAT TAA AGA CTT CTT CTA AAT TTT TCG A-3′) in tandem into the unique HindIII site of GPA1. This oligonucleotide encodes an epitope, Ala-Glu-Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu-Lys, recognized by the c-myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (39Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). Replacement of the N-terminal Gly2 codon was achieved by PCR using mismatched primers (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar) with pBSH/E-GPA1 or pBSH/E-GPA1-myc as templates. The forward primers contain a BamHI site and encode Met-Gly-Cys-Thr (5′-GGG GAT CCC ATG GGG TGT ACA-3′), or Met-Ala-Cys-Thr (5′-GGG GAT CCC ATG GCG TGT ACA-3′). The reverse primer (5′-ATC AGA ACC ACC GGC AA-3′) is complementary to nucleotides 398-414 of the GPA1 open reading frame. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII. pRS316-GPA1 and pRS316-GPA1G2A (Gly2→ Ala substitution) were constructed by ligation of the BamHI-HindIII PCR products into the corresponding sites of pBB194 (from J. Gordon, Washington University). pBB194 consists of pRS316 and the full-length XbaI-EcoRI-EcoRI GPA1 product, including an engineered BamHI site at position −10 relative to the initiator ATG (prepared by S. Reed, Scripps Institute). Tagged and untagged versions of GPA1 were also placed under the control of a heterologous constitutive promoter from ADH1. pRS316-ADH was constructed by moving the BamHI-BamHI-BamHI region containing the ADH1 promoter and terminator from pAD4M (from P. McCabe, Onyx Pharmaceuticals) (40Trahey M. Wong G. Halenbeck R. Rubinfeld B. Martin G.A. Ladner M. Long C.M. Crosier W.J. Watt K. Koths K.

Plasmids pRS316-ADH-GPA1 and pRS316-ADH-GPA1G2A were constructed by ligation of the 1750-base pair BamHI-EcoRI fragment of GPA1 into the corresponding sites of pRS316-ADH. For overexpression of GPA1 or gpa1G2A, the 1750-base pair SalI-EcoRI fragment of GPA1 from pRS316-ADH-GPA1 was transferred into pBluescript, then digested with SalI-SacI and ligated to the corresponding sites in pAD4M. The GPA1-GST 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseAEBSF4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride-HClPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. fusion was obtained from K. Blumer (Washington University) and consists of the full-length GPA1 coding region plus an artificial BamHI site at the 3′ end of the open reading frame (prepared by PCR using the oligonucleotide 5′-GCG GAT CCT ATA ATA CCA ATT TTT TTA AGG TTT TGC-3′), ligated to a corresponding in frame BamHI site in GST (prepared by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCG GGA TCC ATC GAA GGT CGT GGG ATG TCC CCT ATA CTA GGT TAT TGG-3′, containing a BamHI site; and 5′-GGG AAT TCT TAT TTT GGA GGA TGG TCG CCA CC-3′ containing an EcoRI site). pRS316-GPA1-GST fusions were constructed by ligation of the 380-base pair SalI-HindIII fragment from pRS316-ADH-GPA1 or pRS316-ADH-GPA1G2A and the 1680-base pair HindIII-EcoRI fragment from GPA1-GST into the SalI and EcoRI sites of pRS316. pAD4M-GPA1-GST was constructed by ligation of the 2060-base pair SalI-SacI fragment from pRS316-GPA1-GST into the SalI and SacI sites of pAD4M. glutathione S-transferase 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride-HCl polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. pRS316-GAL-STE4/18 was constructed by ligation of the EcoRI-SalI fragment from pL19 (containing GAL1/10 and STE4, from M. Whiteway, National Research Council of Canada) (42Whiteway M. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) into pRS316. STE18 was PCR-amplified using M57p4 as a template (from M. Whiteway) and oligonucleotides that flank the open reading frame (GGG AAT TCT AGG ATA GTA GCA ATC GCA, 5′-oligo; GAG GCT CTA CGT AGC AAG, 3′-oligo), digested with EcoRI and SacI, and ligated to the corresponding sites in pRS316-GAL-STE4. The resulting plasmid allows expression of both genes from the bidirectional, galactose-inducible GAL1/10 promoter. The growth inhibition assay (halo assay) was performed as described previously (43Julius D. Blair L. Brake A. Sprague G. Thorner J. Cell. 1983; 32: 839-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 µl from an overnight culture grown at 34°C were diluted with 2 ml of SCD-uracil, followed by the addition of an equal volume of 1% (w/v) dissolved agar (55°C) and poured onto a culture dish of the same medium. Sterile filter discs were spotted with 15 µg of synthetic α-factor and placed on the nascent lawn. The resulting halo of the G1-arrested cells closest to the source of α-factor was documented after 2 days at 24°C. BJ2168 cells expressing pAD4M-GST, pAD4M-GPA1-GST, or pAD4M-GPA1G2A-GST were grown to mid logarithmic phase in selective medium. Approximately 1.3 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with 10 ml of YPD plus 1% ethanol and resuspended at 2.5 × 107 cells/ml in YPD plus 1% ethanol. After 10 min of growth at 30°C, cells were treated with cerulenin (2 µg/ml) to inhibit endogenous fatty acid synthesis 15 min before the addition of 30 µCi/ml [3H]myristic acid (DuPont NEN, ∼39 Ci/mmol) and grown for 1.5 h. Growth was stopped by the addition of NaN3 to 10 mM. All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 0-4°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 10 mM NaN3 and once with lysis buffer A (40 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.15 M NaCl, 2 µM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride-HCl (AEBSF), and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, benzamidine, aprotinin). Cell pellets were resuspended in 300 µl of lysis buffer A and subjected to glass bead vortex homogenization for 4 min. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was treated with 1% Triton X-100 (final concentration) at 4°C for 1 h to solubilize membrane proteins. 100 µl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (20% slurry) was added to the soluble material and mixed at 4°C for 2 h. The resin were washed three times with 20 mM sodium Pi, pH 7.3, 350 mM NaCl. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris·HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) for 10 min. Samples were subjected to a linear gradient of 7-15% SDS-PAGE, and fixed in H2O:isopropanol:acetic acid (65:25:10) (v/v/v) for 30 min. To cleave possible thioester-linked fatty acids, identical gels were soaked either with 1 M hydroxylamine, pH 7.0, at room temperature for 18 h, or with 1 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, as a control. The gels were then fixed again and treated with Amplify (Amersham Corp.) for 30 min, vacuum dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) (44Masterson W.J. Magee A.I. Magee A.I. Wileman T. Protein Targeting: a Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1992Google Scholar). YGS5 cells expressing pRS316-ADH, pRS316-ADH-GPA1-myc, or pRS316-ADH-GPA1G2A-myc were grown and metabolically labeled with [3H]myristic acid as described above. All subsequent manipulations were carried out at 0-4°C. Approximately 2 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with 10 mM NaN3 and once with radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 µM AEBSF, and 10 µg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, benzamidine, aprotinin). Cells were then resuspended in 150 µl of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Acid-washed glass beads were added and the suspension was vortexed at high speed for 4 min. The lysates were centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was precleared by mixing with 10% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) for 30 min, and then immunoprecipitated by mixing with a monoclonal antibody 9E10 for 1 h, followed by the addition of 10% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B for 30 min. The protein A resin was washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 10 min. Samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, fixed in H2O:isopropanol:acetic acid (65:25:10) (v/v/v) for 30 min, treated with Amplify (Amersham) for 30 min, and vacuum dried. To cleave possible thioester-linked fatty acids, gels were soaked with 1 M hydroxylamine, pH 7.0, at room temperature for 18 h, or with 1 M Tris·HCl, pH 7.0, as a control. BJ2168 cells expressing pAD4M-GST, pAD4M-GPA1-GST, or pAD4M-GPA1G2A-GST were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in SCD-leucine medium. Growth was stopped by the addition of NaN3 to 10 mM. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 0-4°C. 5 × 108 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min and washed in lysis buffer A. Cell pellets were resuspended in 350 µl of lysis buffer A, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 µM GDP and subjected to glass bead vortex homogenization for 4 min. The lysate was centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was treated with 1% Triton X-100 (final concentration) at 4°C for 1 h to solubilize membrane proteins. 100 µl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Pharmacia) (20% slurry) was added to the lysate and mixed at 4°C for 2 h. The resin was resuspended in either buffer A containing 3 mM MgCl2, 10 µM GDP, 1% Triton X-100 (GDP buffer), or 50 mM MgCl2, 20 µM GTPγS, 1% Triton X-100 (GTPγS buffer) and mixed at 4°C for 2 h. (Higher magnesium concentrations (50 mM) were initially used to promote subunit dissociation, since these conditions have previously been shown to accelerate guanine nucleotide exchange and binding of GTPγS. Magnesium forms a complex with the bound GTP and is essential for the conformational change leading to Gβγ release (45Higashijima T. Ferguson K.M. Sternweis P.C. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of raising the magnesium concentration varies somewhat depending on the Gα subtype, however, and can even retard exchange in some cases (46Hepler J.R. Biddlecome G.H. Kleuss C. Camp L.A.

Although all of our initial experiments were carried out at high magnesium, in subsequent experiments we found no difference in the extent of Gβγ binding or dissociation at 3 mM versus 50 mM magnesium.)

Here we describe a unique alternative RNA splicing event that occurs during the development of germ cells in the testis, resulting in a translational switch from an mRNA encoding activator CREB to an mRNA encoding novel inhibitor CREB isoforms (I-CREBs). Alternative splicing of an additional exon into the CREB mRNA in mid to late pachytene spermatocytes results in the premature termination of translation and consequent downstream reinitiation of translation producing I-CREBs. The I-CREBs down-regulate cAMP-activated gene expression by inhibiting activator CREB from binding to cAMP response elements. Further, the developmental stage-specific expression of I-CREBs in germ cells of the seminiferous tubules correlates with the cyclical down-regulation of activator CREB, suggesting that I-CREBs repress expression of the cAMP-inducible CREB gene as well as other genes transiently induced by cAMP during the 12-day cycle of spermatogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2058340238,"Expression of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes has been shown previously to increase at the transcriptional level following exposure to interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In this report we have examined the molecular mechanisms involved in the IFN-γ-induced transcription of the human MHC class I gene, HLA-E. Functional analysis of CAT reporter gene constructs under the control of the HLA-E promoter transfected into U937 cells revealed the presence of a distinct IFN-γ-responsive element, termed the interferon response region (IRR), that was necessary and sufficient to mediate the response to IFN-γ. This cis-acting regulatory sequence contains an imperfect inverted repeat; the 5′-half of the IRR resembles the IFN-γ activation site (GAS), and the 3′-half of the IRR resembles the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the IRR bound a single, specific, IFN-γ-induced complex (IRR-AC), which was formed rapidly following treatment with IFN-γ and was independent of protein synthesis. Competition experiments with GAS and ISRE sequences from other IFN-inducible genes showed that GAS sequences competed for the IRR-AC, whereas ISRE sequences did not compete. Mutational analysis demonstrated that point mutations in either the 5′-half or 3′-half of the IRR prevented binding of the complex and abrogated or markedly reduced the IFN-γ responsiveness of reporter gene constructs. Supershift analysis revealed that the IRR-AC contains a factor that was recognized by antibodies specific for the protein STAT1α (signal transducer and activator of transcription). Taken together, these findings suggest that the mechanism of IFN-γ-induced transcription of the HLA-E gene is distinct from that of other MHC class I genes.

DeMaeyer-Guignard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). They are known to mediate these effects, at least in part, by inducing the expression of a number of cellular genes (2Revel M. Chebath J. Trends Biochem.

Progress toward understanding the basic mechanisms of transcriptional activation by IFNs has come through identification of the proteins comprising the JAK-STAT class of signal transduction pathways, which include STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins that bind alone or in combination with other proteins to the DNA regulatory elements present in IFN-inducible genes (reviewed in Refs. 4Darnell Jr., J.E.

The classical MHC class I genes are highly polymorphic and encode transmembrane glycoproteins, known as class I heavy chains, that associate noncovalently with β2-microglobulin (38Ploegh H.L. Orr H.T. Strominger J.L. Cell. 1981; 42: 287-299Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One of the primary functions of MHC class I molecules is to mediate the cellular immune response by presenting antigenic peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (39Townsend A. Bodmer H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 601-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), which results in CTL-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells and tumor cells. In contrast, expression of MHC class I molecules on target cells has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on natural killer cell lytic activity (40Quillet A. Presse F. Marchiol-Fournigault C. Harel-Bellan A. Benbunan M. Ploegh H. Fradelizi D. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 17-20PubMed Google Scholar, 41Storkus W.J. Alexander J. Payne J.A. Cresswell P. Dawson J.R. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3853-3857PubMed Google Scholar). As noted above, MHC class I genes from both humans and mice are among those induced by both types of IFNs, with preferential induction by IFN-γ (2Revel M. Chebath J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 166-170Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 42Wallach D. Fellous M. Revel M. Nature. 1982; 299: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the ISRE present in the 5′-flanking sequences of these genes is necessary for the induction of class I genes by IFN-γ, although in some cases the ISRE may not be sufficient to mediate the full response (22Israel A. Kimura A. Fournier A. Fellous M. Kourilsky P. Nature. 1986; 322: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Hakem R. Le Bouteiller P. Jezo-Bremond A. Harper K. Campese D. Lemonnier F.A. J.

The IRF-1 protein has been identified as an IFN-γ-induced factor that binds to the ISRE which may be involved in the IFN-γ-mediated induction of class I gene expression (44Blanar M.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Flavell R.A. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Chang C.H. Hammer J. Loh J.E. Fodor W.L. Flavell R.A. Immunogenetics. 1992; 35: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The binding of this factor requires ongoing protein synthesis, suggesting that induction of classical MHC class I genes by IFN-γ is not mediated by preexisting proteins (44Blanar M.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Flavell R.A. Sharp P.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1139-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical class I genes, the MHC class I region includes several nonclassical class I genes (reviewed in Refs. 46Stroynowski I. Lindahl K.F. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 47Shawar S.M. Vyas J.M. Rodgers J.R. Rich R.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 839-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The nonclassical class I molecules are generally characterized as having limited polymorphism, restricted tissue expression, and relatively low cell surface expression. The function of these molecules remains unclear; however, emerging evidence suggests that the nonclassical class I molecules may have a specialized role in the immune response by presenting a subset of antigenic peptides (47Shawar S.M. Vyas J.M. Rodgers J.R. Rich R.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 839-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 48Pamer E.G. Wang C.R. Flaherty L. Lindahl K.F. Bevan M.J.

A. 1991; 88: 10475-10479Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Like classical MHC class I genes, the human nonclassical HLA-E (50Koller B.H. Geraghty D.E. Shimizu Y. DeMars R. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 897-904PubMed Google Scholar) gene has been previously shown to be induced by IFN-γ, although the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated (51Ulbrecht M. Honka T. Person S. Johnson J.P. Weiss E.H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2945-2953PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have examined the mechanism of IFN-γ-induced expression of the HLA-E gene and present evidence suggesting that the regulation of the HLA-E gene differs from that previously described for other class I genes. Functional analysis of the HLA-E promoter using reporter gene constructs reveals the presence of a distinct IFN-γ-responsive regulatory element, which we have designated the interferon response region (IRR). The IRR contains an imperfect inverted repeat; the 5′-half of the IRR and 3′-half of the IRR act synergistically to mediate the full response to IFN-γ. Gel mobility shift assays reveal that the IRR binds a single, specific, IFN-γ-induced complex, termed the IRR-activation complex (IRR-AC), which is formed rapidly and independently of protein synthesis. Supershift analysis demonstrates that the IRR-AC contains a factor that is recognized by antibodies specific for the protein STAT1α. Promonocytic U937 cells (ATCC CRL 1593) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 µg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were induced with IFN-γ (R & D Systems) at 250 units/ml for the times indicated. Cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma) was used at 50 µg/ml and added to the cultures 30 min prior to induction with IFN-γ where indicated. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using a rapid nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation method described previously (52Chen E. Karr R.W. Frost J.P. Gonwa T.A. Ginder G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For RNase protection assays, single-stranded, radiolabeled cRNA probes were synthesized using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]GTP (Amersham Corp.) (53Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) with the following templates. For the HLA-E gene, a 702-base pair (bp) PstI-XbaI fragment containing 258 nucleotides from the third exon subcloned into the plasmid SP65 was kindly provided by Harry Orr (54Wei X.H. Orr H.T. Hum. Immunol. 1990; 29: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar); for the triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) gene, a 113-bp EcoRI-SacI fragment from the 5′ region of the full-length cDNA for human TPI (kindly provided by Lynne Maquat) was subcloned into pGEM-3zf(−) (Promega). 5-30 µg of U937 cytoplasmic RNA was hybridized overnight with 5 × 105 cpm of the radiolabeled probe according to Melton et al. (53Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Following digestion with RNase A (40 µg/ml) and RNase T1 (2 µg/ml) at 37°C for 30 min, samples were deproteinated and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel followed by autoradiography. HLA-E induction was quantified by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics), and values were normalized to constitutively expressed TPI mRNA. For the RNase protection assay used to identify the transcription initiation site(s) of the HLA-E gene, the probe was synthesized as described above but with template DNA subcloned into pGEM-3zf(−), which consisted of an HLA-E genomic fragment that included sequence from exon 1 and the 5′-flanking region (positions 615-767 bp, (Ref. 50Koller B.H. Geraghty D.E. Shimizu Y. DeMars R. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 897-904PubMed Google Scholar)), as predicted by alignment with other class I gene sequences. The samples were hybridized and processed as described above and then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gel along with a set of dideoxy sequencing reactions using a 26-nucleotide primer (positions 742-767 bp, (Ref. 50Koller B.H. Geraghty D.E. Shimizu Y. DeMars R. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 897-904PubMed Google Scholar)) and template DNA containing the HLA-E genomic fragment as marker. The pECAT clone contains approximately 1800 bp of 5′-flanking sequence and was generated by sequentially subcloning HindIII-PstI (−1800 to −174) and PstI-AlwNI (−174 to +2) promoter fragments from the HLA 6.2 genomic clone (kindly provided by Harry Orr (50Koller B.H. Geraghty D.E. Shimizu Y. DeMars R. Orr H.T. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 897-904PubMed Google Scholar)) into the HindIII and PstI sites of the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene vector pCAT-Basic (Promega). The 5′-deletion mutants designated pE−386CAT, pE−174CAT, and pE−128CAT were generated by restriction enzyme digestion of larger clones and subsequent religation of the plasmid. The 5′-deletion mutant pE−193CAT was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a primer corresponding to the HLA-E sequence −193 to −181 with the addition of a HindIII site at the 5′-end and a primer corresponding to sequences from the pCAT-Basic plasmid together with pE−386CAT as the template DNA. Following PCR, the product was gel-isolated, digested with HindIII and SalI to make cohesive ends, and ligated into the HindIII and SalI sites of pCAT-Basic. The deletion mutant pE−193del−170/−129CAT contains an internal deletion of bases −170 to −129 and was generated by subcloning the −193 to −171 HindIII-PstI fragment from pE−193CAT upstream of pE−128CAT. The pTKCAT construct was generated by subcloning the sequences from −105 to +51 of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter into the HindIII and XbaI site of pCAT-Basic. The pE−193/−146TKCAT construct was generated by subcloning the HLA-E fragment from −193 to −146 upstream of the TK promoter of pTKCAT. The 5′-half-IRR point mutants were prepared by cloning synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides into the HindIII and PstI sites of pE−174CAT. The 3′-half-IRR point mutant was generated by using PCR overlap extension techniques (55Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) together with the pE−193CAT construct as template DNA. Following PCR, the product containing the point mutations was gel-isolated, digested with HindIII and AccI to make cohesive ends, and ligated into the HindIII and AccI sites of pCAT-Basic. All constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method to verify the deletion end points and mutated sequences. U937 cells were transfected by electroporation in RPMI 1640 medium at 210 V and 900 microfarads using a BTX Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (Biotechnologies & Experimental Research, Inc.). A total of 1.5 × 107 U937 cells were transfected with 40 µg of CAT reporter gene plasmid and 1 µg of the internal control plasmid consisting of the gene encoding β-galactosidase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Cells from four replicate cuvettes were pooled and then divided among four flasks to ensure equal transfection efficiency between duplicate untreated and IFN-γ-treated samples. The cells were incubated for 2 h and then left untreated or treated with IFN-γ and incubated for an additional 8 h. Cell lysates were prepared and CAT assays were performed according to the CAT enzyme assay system protocol (Promega) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 120 µl of 1 × reporter lysis buffer. Following a 15-min incubation, the lysates were subjected to a single freeze/thaw cycle, vortexed, and centrifuged for 2 min at 4°C to pellet cellular debris. The lysates were transferred to a new tube, and an aliqout was heated at 65°C for 10 min prior to determining CAT activity using n-butyryl-coenzyme A and [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham) followed by extraction with mixed xylenes. β-galactosidase activity was determined using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent reporter assay system (Tropix, Inc.). CAT activity was normalized to the internal control β-galactosidase activity. Nuclear protein extracts from U937 cells were prepared according to the method of Dignam (56Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin (10 µg/ml), pepstatin (10 µg/ml), aprotinin (10 µg/ml), and phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay (57Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DNA fragments were labeled by filling in the 5′-protruding ends with Klenow enzyme using [α-32P]dATP (Amersham). Binding reactions (20 µl) contained 10 µg of nuclear extract, 50 fmol of double-stranded DNA probe, and 4 µg of poly(dI-dC) in a buffer consisting of 12 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.12 mM EDTA, 0.06 mM EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM ATP, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in a buffer that consisted of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 3.3 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography or exposure to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) for quantitation. In competition analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated for 10 min with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe. In supershift analysis, antibodies were added to the binding reactions and incubated on ice for 60 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used in supershift analysis and purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: STAT1α (sc-345X), STAT3 (sc-482X), ISGF3γ p48 (sc-496X), IRF-1 (sc-497X), and IRF-2 (sc-498X).

In these animals, GnRH neurons were transformed before they migrated to their final location in the rostral hypothalamus, complicating an analysis of cell-specific expression. To localize regions of the hGnRH promoter that are important for cell-specific expression, we created transgenic mice with various 5′-flanking regions of the hGnRH gene fused to the luciferase reporter gene. When 3828 or 1131 bp of the hGnRH promoter 5′-flanking DNA were used (−3828/+5LUC and −1131/+5LUC, respectively), luciferase expression in adult transgenic mice was observed in the rostral hypothalamus and olfactory tissues, regions which have been shown to be loci of GnRH-expressing neurons. Luciferase expression was not observed in other brain or peripheral tissues. Double-labeled in situ hybridization further demonstrated that luciferase expression was invariably colocalized with GnRH expression. When transgenic animals were created with a construct consisting of 484 bp of the hGnRH 5′-flanking DNA fused to the luciferase gene (−484/+5LUC), luciferase expression was not observed in the hypothalamus or in olfactory tissues.

It has become increasingly clear that the precise coordinated release and expression of GnRH are essential for proper function of the mammalian reproductive system. For example, patients with Kallmann's syndrome do not appear to contain GnRH neurons in the appropriate locations within the hypothalamus due to a failure of the GnRH neurons to migrate from the olfactory placode during development, which manifests as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (1Schwanzel-Fukuda M.

These cells possess a neuronal morphology, express and release GnRH, and respond to secretagogues in a manner consistent with that seen in GnRH neurons in vivo and in vitro. These cell lines have proven to be invaluable for studying the regulation of GnRH expression (16Wetsel W.C. Eraly S.A. Whyte D.B. Mellon P.L.

It is not clear at this time, however, what transcription factors or cis-regulatory elements are important for initiating and regulating the hypothalamic expression of hGnRH. The studies performed by our group using −1131 bp of the hGnRH promoter to target tumorigenesis in transgenic mice had appeared to transform only GnRH neurons (15Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nicols D.K. Nakayama Y. Weintraub B.D. Westphal H. Cutler Jr., G.B. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region of the hGnRH promoter was sufficient to direct gene expression to the GnRH neuron. However, since these neurons may not have completely differentiated before they were transformed and did not migrate to their final location in the forebrain, it was unclear whether this portion of the hGnRH promoter was actually the minimal promoter needed to appropriately direct and regulate the normal expression of GnRH. We therefore sought to target expression of the luciferase reporter gene (22De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar) with fragments of the promoter for the hGnRH gene. The luciferase gene is an extremely sensitive reporter, which is a quality necessary for use in the study of the physiological and developmental regulation of the sparsely distributed GnRH neurons. By linking various portions of the GnRH promoter to a luciferase reporter and creating transgenic animals with these constructs, it has been possible to examine the anatomical pattern of expression of luciferase as an assay of hGnRH promoter activity. Series of anatomical and physiological analyses have illustrated that luciferase expression that is driven by a sufficient segment of the hGnRH promoter is correlated with the expression of the endogenous GnRH gene. These studies localize a cis-regulatory region between −1131 and −484 bp upstream of the GnRH gene, which is essential for the appropriate expression of GnRH in the brain. Additionally, these studies demonstrate that appropriate gonadal steroid regulation of GnRH expression requires gene elements present within 3828 base pairs of the hGnRH gene. Transgenic animals were constructed by injecting a purified linear DNA fragment containing a GnRH/LUC construct free of vector DNA sequences into fertilized mouse oocytes as described previously by Radovick et al. (15Radovick S. Wray S. Lee E. Nicols D.K. Nakayama Y. Weintraub B.D. Westphal H. Cutler Jr., G.B. Wondisford F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The hGnRH promoter fragments contained a variable amount of 5′-flanking DNA, but each had a common 3′ end point at +5 bp. Oocytes were then transferred into pseudo-pregnant foster mothers. Transgenic animals were identified by Southern blot analysis with a 1.2-kilobase pair LUC probe consisting of the coding sequence of the LUC gene using standard procedures. Briefly, EcoRI-digested mouse tail DNA was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred to GeneScreen Plus hybridization transfer membrane (DuPont NEN), UV cross-linked for 1.5 min, and placed into hybridization solution (46% formamide, 0.91 M NaCl, 9.1% dextran sulfate, and 1.8% SDS) for at least 5 h at 42°C. Probe (1,000,000 cpm/ml hybridization solution) was mixed with 100 µg of salmon sperm/ml of hybridization solution, heat denatured for 5 min, and added to the hybridization solution overnight at 42°C. The blots were then rinsed three times with 2 × SSC and washed for 30 min with 2 × SSC and 1% SDS at 65°C. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis and cervical dislocation. The rostral hypothalamus was dissected in a single fragment consisting rostrocaudally of tissue from the anterior edge of the mammillary bodies to a point just anterior of the optic chiasm, 1 mm laterally beyond the lateral aspect of the median eminence and 3 mm dorsally. The olfactory tissue was dissected to include both olfactory bulbs and the tissue rostral to the hypothalamic section; again, the dorsal incision was 3 mm deep. The caudal hypothalamus included the region from the rostral aspect of the mammillary bodies to a point 1 mm caudal to the mammillary bodies and with the same dorsal and lateral parameters as those taken for the rostral hypothalamus. Small sections were taken of the remaining tissues with less care taken to consistently target a specific intra-anatomical location within each organ or tissue. In most cases, however, whole regions were removed for homogenization. Tissues were removed and placed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) homogenized with a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). 300 µl of the homogenate was then removed and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g, and 200 µl of the supernatant was assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase assays were done in a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold Systems Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Samples were injected with 100 µl of luciferin (0.75 mM) and 100 µl of assay buffer (25 mM glycylglycine, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 15 mM KPO4, 3 mM dithiothreitol, and 3 mM ATP), and luminescence was measured for 20 s in relative light units. The relative light units were then normalized for sample size by correcting for protein content. Protein assays were done using a Bio-Rad protein assay and bovine serum albumin standards. Double-labeled in situ hybridization histochemical analyses of the hypothalamus and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) of four different lines of −3828/+5LUC transgenic animals (three males and one female) and two different lines of −1131/+5LUC transgenic animals (one male and one female) were performed using antisense oligonucleotide probes to mouse GnRH and luciferase message. A labeled digoxigenin oligonucleotide (1 µl of digoxigenin/slide) corresponding to the decapeptide portion of the mouse GnRH gene was used to label GnRH mRNA, and three 35S-labeled (250,000 cpm/section, 750,000 cpm/slide) 48-mer oligonucleotides against luciferase (bases 1464-1511, bases 321-368, and bases 1152-1105 (22De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar)) were used as probes to label luciferase expression. Animals were gonadectomized under light avertin anesthesia (100% avertin = 10 mg of tribromyl ethanol in 10 ml of tert-amyl ethanol). In males, the testes were removed through a ventral incision made in the abdomen. Sham castrated animals received a ventral incision, but the testes remained intact. In females, the ovaries were removed through a dorsal incision, and sham ovariectomized animals also received a dorsal incision. Males received a pellet of either testosterone (5 mg/pellet) or cholesterol (5 mg/pellet) while females received a pellet of 17β-estradiol (0.5 mg/pellet) or cholesterol (5 mg/pellet), which was inserted dorsally with a 10-gauge trochar. All steroid pellets and the trochar were obtained from Innovative Research of America (Toledo, OH). The incisions were sutured, and the animals were allowed to recover for 2 weeks. Animals were checked daily to ensure that the wounds were healing properly. Immunoreactive β-estradiol and testosterone were determined by radioimmunoassays using double antibody kits (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). The level of sensitivity of the β-estradiol radioimmunoassay was 10 pg/ml with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (cv) of between 10 and 6% at the levels measured. The level of sensitivity was 100 pg/ml with a cv of 6% at the levels measured. Transgenic mice (−3828/+5LUC and −1131/+5LUC) were sacrificed with CO2 at a variety of time points following birth (see Fig. 5). For prepubertal mice, the entire brain was homogenized and assayed for luciferase expression. For adult mice, luciferase expression from the hypothalamus and the olfactory cortex was combined to give the total value. Dissections were performed as described above. Animal studies were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. Transgenic animals were created using either −3828, −1131, or −484 bp of the hGnRH gene with a common 3′ end point of +5 fused to the luciferase reporter gene (−3828/+5LUC, −1131/+5LUC, and −484/+5LUC, respectively). Table I indicates the number of founder animals from each line that was obtained and the offspring that have been evaluated in this study. At least three founder lines from each construct were obtained, and these lines were bred to generate F1 and later generations. Fig. 1a illustrates the luciferase activity present in selected tissue extracts from a representative animal bearing the −3828/+5LUC transgene. Luciferase activity, when corrected for protein concentration in the tissue extract, was detected in hypothalamic and olfactory tissues but not in cortical, cerebellar, or other non-neural tissues. Expression in the hypothalamus was at least 50-fold greater than in any peripheral tissues. Non-transgenic animals (not shown) had no significant luciferase activity in these same tissues, indicating the specificity of this reporter gene assay for detecting GnRH gene expression in these tissues.TABLE ITable displaying the number of founder animals constructed from each GnRh promoter-luciferase fusion construct, whether each transgenic type demonstrated tissue-specific expression of luciferase, and whether F1 or later generations have yet been evaluated The histology and the effects of the sex steroids were examined in the same −3828/+5LUC founder line.Construct usedNo. of foundersHypothalamic expressionF1, or later, generations examined−3828/+5LUC3YY−1131/+5LUC5YY−484/+5LUC4NY Open table in a new tab Similar results were obtained with the −1131/+5LUC construct. In a representative animal shown in Fig. 1b, both hypothalamic tissue and to a lesser extent olfactory tissue expressed the transgene at levels equal to or greater than the −3828/+5LUC construct. These data indicate that DNA sequences between −3828 and −1131 bp are not required to direct tissue-specific expression of the human GnRH gene to the hypothalamus and also are not required for basal expression of this transgene in mice. In contrast, the −484/+5LUC construct is not expressed in either the hypothalamus or the olfactory lobes, but expression was found in a mesenteric tumor (Fig. 1c). These results indicate that DNA sequences between −1131 and −484 bp of the promoter are essential to direct appropriate tissue-specific expression of the hGnRH gene in transgenic mice to rostral brain regions and suggest that discrete cis-acting regulatory regions controlling GnRH gene expression are located in these DNA sequences. To further localize transgene expression of the −3828/+5LUC construct, the preoptic area, more caudal hypothalamic tissue, and the olfactory lobes were excised and assayed separately. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the majority of expression in either age-matched male or female adult animals was localized to the preoptic area. In keeping with expression of the GnRH gene in the mouse, more caudal regions of the hypothalamus and olfactory cortex also expressed significant luciferase activity. To confirm that luciferase expression was localized to the GnRH neuron, in situ hybridization histochemical analysis of the rostral hypothalamus was performed in transgenic animals. Antisense probes to luciferase and mouse GnRH cDNA were hybridized to tissue sections. Fig. 3 is a representative tissue section through the OVLT of an animal bearing the −3828/+5LUC transgene. Colocalization of GnRH (digoxigenin-labeled probe, purple) and luciferase (35S-labeled probe, silver grains) is demonstrated. Luciferase and GnRH probe hybridization colocalized to neurons in the OVLT and to a lesser extent in the caudal hypothalamus and olfactory lobes, appropriate regions for GnRH expression (5Barry J. Hoffman G.E. Wray S. Björklund Hökfelt T. Handbook of Chemical Neuroanatomy. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1985: 166Google Scholar, 44Silverman A.-J. Livne I. Witkin J.W. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994: 1683Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that luciferase and GnRH mRNA are consistently coexpressed in the same neurons and that physiologically relevant regulation of endogenous GnRH gene transcription can be evaluated by measurement of the luciferase reporter construct expression. 8- to 10-week-old adult mice from the same founder line underwent gonadectomy or sham surgery. 2 weeks after surgery, gonadectomized male and female animals were given replacement testosterone or estrogen, respectively. 14 days after replacement, animals were sacrificed and hypothalamic tissue was assayed for luciferase activity. Fig. 4, a and b, shows hypothalamic luciferase activity from −3828/+5LUC transgenic adult female and male animals, respectively, after sham surgery, gonadectomy, or gonadectomy and sex steroid replacement. Fig. 4a demonstrates that gonadectomy in females is associated with a significant increase in hypothalamic luciferase activity, and chronic estrogen replacement therapy resulted in a suppression of luciferase activity. In the olfactory lobe, gonadectomy also increased luciferase activity, and estrogen replacement returned luciferase activity back to control levels. These data suggest that estrogen, acting either directly on the GnRH neuron or indirectly via interneuronal pathways, can modulate the transcriptional activity of the hGnRH gene. The data also demonstrated that castration of males resulted in some increased luciferase expression when compared with sham castrated males. Testosterone-treated castrated males expressed luciferase at levels not significantly different from those of sham castrated animals. These results suggest that testosterone may have inhibitory effects on GnRH transcription in male mice, but its effects were not as profound as those of estrogen in female animals. This sex difference is unlikely to be attributable to an insufficient efficacy of the testosterone treatment versus the estrogen treatment since radioimmunoassay measurements of serum testosterone and β-estradiol indicate that levels in steroid capsule-treated animals were between 6- and 22-fold higher than those seen in intact animals. To understand how GnRH gene transcription varies with development, hypothalamic expression of luciferase was measured in transgenic animals bearing the −3828/+5LUC or the −1131/+5LUC transgene through development. Fig. 5 demonstrates hypothalamic luciferase activity during development of the −1131/+5LUC animals. Note that luciferase activity rises during the first few days of life and peaks around day 10, approximately 10-15 days before the first external signs of puberty in the mouse. Hypothalamic luciferase activity subsequently falls to adult levels after day 18. Therefore, peak luciferase activity, which is an indirect measure of GnRH gene transcription, is noted significantly before the onset of puberty in these animals. Similar results were obtained in −3828/+5LUC transgenic animals (data not shown). These data indicate that GnRH gene transcription can be modulated during development by as little as a −1131 to +5 bp of the hGnRH promoter and suggest that cis-acting elements mediating these developmental responses are located within this promoter region. The appropriate expression and release of GnRH from neurons in the hypothalamus are vital for the elaboration of normal reproductive function in mammals. In the mouse, presumptive GnRH neurons arise from cells in the olfactory placode. They migrate during development to their final location in the hypothalamus. The initiation of GnRH expression starts during this period of cellular migration at about prenatal day 10 (4Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In the adult, GnRH expression is located primarily in the rostral hypothalamus with additional neurons located in the migratory pathway within olfactory regions. In the present study, we have used the luciferase reporter gene as a cellular marker for expression and fused it to varying segments of the GnRH promoter. Both a −3828 to +5- and a −1131 to +5-bp region of the promoter were essential to direct expression of a luciferase reporter gene to hypothalamic neurons and to a lesser extent to neurons of the olfactory cortex (Fig. 1, a and b, respectively). However, a −484 to +5-bp fragment of the promoter did not target luciferase expression in the hypothalamus or olfactory cortex (Fig. 1c). Therefore, we have demonstrated that tissue-specific expression of the GnRH gene is mediated by a 647-bp fragment (−1131 to −484 bp) of the proximal promoter of the human GnRH gene. Cell-specific expression of the luciferase reporter gene was demonstrated with double-labeled in situ hybridization (Fig. 3). Analysis of histological sections revealed that GnRH expression in the −3828/+5LUC animals and luciferase expression were colocalized in rostral hypothalamic tissue. GnRH staining and luciferase staining were never observed independently of each other. There were very low but detectable levels of luciferase expression in other tissues, and it is possible that expression of luciferase in non-hypothalamic tissue may have occurred in cells that were not expressing GnRH. However, these data confirm that cell-specific expression of hGnRH gene has been obtained in transgenic animals. Recent work in the GT1 cell line, a mouse GnRH cell line that was developed by targeting the SV40 large T antigen to GnRH neurons with the rat GnRH promoter, found that cell-specific expression in the rat may require cis-regulatory regions more 5′ to what is needed to target the GnRH gene using the hGnRH promoter. The results obtained in the GT1 cell line have suggested that a cis-regulatory element located between −1863 and −1571 bp of the rat GnRH gene is necessary for the cell-specific expression of GnRH (26Whyte D.B. Lawson M.A. Belsham D.D. Eraly S.A. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. Mellon P.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 467-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using DNase I footprinting and scanning replacement mutagenesis, several regions were found to be important for in vitro GnRH expression, and it was postulated that several different transcription factors might interact at these sites to regulate gene expression. While the rat enhancer is in a different location than the cell-specific element in the hGnRH gene, there is significant homology (54%) between the cis-regulatory elements in the rat gene and the region of the human GnRH promoter demonstrated in the present studies to be necessary for the cell-specific expression of GnRH (−1131 to −484 bp upstream of the hypothalamic transcriptional start site). It is unclear at this time whether this discrepancy in localization of cell-specific elements between the human and rat GnRH genes represents a species-specific difference. Interestingly, the hGnRH cell-specific element contains several consensus binding sequences for POU homeodomain proteins, which in other systems have been demonstrated to act as cell-specific transcriptional activators (23Ingraham J.A. Albert V.R. Chen R. Crenshaw E.B. Elsholtz H.P. He X. Kapiloff M.S. Mangalam H.J. Swanson L.W. Treacy M.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 773-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 24Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Specifically, Brn-2 and Brn-3 sites were noted between −959 and −493 bp of the hGnRH gene. The corticotropin-releasing factor gene contains several Brn-2 DNA-binding sites, and Brn-2 has been shown to regulate the expression of the corticotropin-releasing factor gene (25Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). There are also two consensus Oct-1/Oct-2-binding sites located between −838 and −735 bp. Oct-1 has been proposed as an activator of immunoglobulin gene expression, and Oct-2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed (27Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 28Muller M.M. Ruppert S. Schaffner W. Matthias P. Nature. 1988; 336: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Recently, Oct-1 has been shown to bind to the enhancer in the rat GnRH gene and increase gene transcription (29Clarke M.E. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6169-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lymphocytes have been reported to express GnRH, and this site may function as a cis-acting element controlling expression in these cells (30Wilson T.M. Yu-Lee L.Y. Kelley M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 44-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At this time, however, it is unclear whether these particular sites are involved in regulating expression of the hGnRH gene. There is great debate concerning the effects of the gonadal steroids on GnRH expression. It has been reported that estradiol inhibits (31Zoeller R.T. Seeburg P.H. Young III, W.S. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2570-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 32Toranzo D. Dupont E. Simard J. Labrie C. Covet J. Labrie F. Pelletier G. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3604-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) on GnRH expression. The variable results in females are most likely due to differences in the experimental paradigms used and to the well characterized positive and negative feedback effects that estradiol has demonstrated to exert on GnRH neurons. However, most studies with chronic estrogen treatment in vivo suggest that GnRH expression is inhibited. Our results in the present study demonstrate that β-estradiol decreased expression of GnRH gene transcription, as measured by the luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase expression in females 2 weeks after ovariectomy was significantly higher than in intact females. When ovariectomized females were treated with estradiol, luciferase expression values were significantly lower than those seen in either gonadectomized or intact animals. These data indicated that estrogen can modulate the hGnRH gene promoter through either a direct action on the GnRH neuron or via other neuronal connections and that estrogen-responsive elements are contained within 3828 base pairs upstream of the hGnRH gene. There has also been a divergence of opinion regarding the effect of testosterone on GnRH expression (32Toranzo D. Dupont E. Simard J. Labrie C. Covet J. Labrie F. Pelletier G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Malik K.F. Silverman A.-J. Morrell J.I. Anat. Rec. 1991; 231: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that testosterone also has a significant effect on luciferase expression in males, although this effect was less profound than the effects of estrogen in the females. It is not clear whether these differences are due to an inherent disparity between androgen- and estrogen-mediated regulation of GnRH. The onset of GnRH expression in the mouse is seen in the olfactory pit between day 10 and day 11 of embryological life (4Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The bulk of GnRH-expressing neurons then migrate to their final location in the rostral forebrain. After birth, GnRH expression in the rat was found to increase sharply some 20 days before the onset of puberty and to decline to more moderate levels thereafter (43Dutlow C.M. Rachman J. Jacobs T.W. Millar R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2496-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Results from the present study indicate that the hypothalamic expression of GnRH gene in the mouse, as expected, has a similar temporal pattern of expression as that of the rat with a sharp transient increase in luciferase expression observed at 10 days, which is about 10-15 days before the beginning of reproductive function of the mice in our colony. Increased expression of GnRH is probably important for the increased production and release of GnRH that may trigger the initiation of reproductive viability. Our results suggest, but do not prove, that the increase in GnRH expression observed prior to puberty may be mediated by an increase in GnRH gene transcription. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that cell-specific in vivo expression of the human GnRH gene can be obtained with a region of the promoter between −1131 and +5 bp. A further deletion of this gene localizes a cell-specific element of the hGnRH gene to a region between −1131 and −484 bp. The elements responsible for the functional regulation of GnRH gene expression within this region have not yet been elucidated, but this region contains several DNA-binding site homologies for Oct-1, Oct-2, Brn-2, and Brn-3. It is tempting to speculate that the POU homeodomain family of transcription factors may have a role in the regulation of GnRH gene expression in the hypothalamus. Further studies will be necessary to prove or disprove this hypothesis.

We find that SSTR1S305F has low affinity for a number of SSTR2-selective hexapeptides, suggesting that these analogs have different binding requirements than SMS-201-995. A correlation is seen between the ability of SSTR1S305F to bind hexapeptide analogs and the presence of a phenylalanine, but not tyrosine, at position two in these small cyclic molecules. Thus, a single hydroxyl group in hexapeptides can play a critical role in determining receptor binding to these receptor mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2008830351,"The gene 59 protein (gp59) of bacteriophage T4 stimulates the activities of gene 41 protein (gp41), the T4 replicative DNA helicase, by promoting the assembly of gp41 onto single-stranded (ss)-DNA molecules that are covered with cooperatively bound gene 32 protein (gp32). This helicase-ssDNA assembly process, which is important for the reconstitution of the primosome component of the T4 DNA replication fork, appears to require both gp59-gp41 and gp59-gp32 protein-protein interactions. In this study we characterize the physical and functional interactions of gp59 with gp32, the T4 ssDNA-binding protein. Experimental results presented herein indicate: 1) that gp59 binds specifically to both free and ssDNA-bound gp32 molecules; and 2) that in both cases binding involves contacts between gp59 and the acidic C-terminal domain of gp32 (the so-called “A-domain”). We further show that single-stranded DNA molecules coated with (gp32-A), a truncated form of gp32 lacking the A-domain, are refractory to gp59-dependent helicase assembly. The data indicate that specific contacts between gp59 molecules and the A-domains of gp32 molecules are essential for gp59-dependent assembly of gp41 onto gp32-ssDNA complexes. Our results are consistent with a model in which gp59 binds to gp32 molecules within the gp32-ssDNA complex and therein forms a target site for helicase-ssDNA assembly.

We further show that single-stranded DNA molecules coated with (gp32-A), a truncated form of gp32 lacking the A-domain, are refractory to gp59-dependent helicase assembly. The data indicate that specific contacts between gp59 molecules and the A-domains of gp32 molecules are essential for gp59-dependent assembly of gp41 onto gp32-ssDNA complexes. Our results are consistent with a model in which gp59 binds to gp32 molecules within the gp32-ssDNA complex and therein forms a target site for helicase-ssDNA assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2029953068,"Ch21, a developmentally regulated extracellular protein expressed in chick embryos and in cultured chondrocytes, was expressed in the baculovirus system, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by gel-filtration chromatography. Separation of two isoforms was achieved on an ion-exchange column. Previous work had shown that Ch21 belongs to the superfamily of lipocalins, which are transport proteins for small hydrophobic molecules. Studies were performed to identify the Ch21 ligand. By analysis of recombinant Ch21 on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by Lipidex assay, the binding of fatty acid to the protein was shown and a preferential binding of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids was observed. Both isoforms had the same behavior. The binding was saturable. Stoichiometry was about 0.7 mol of ligand/mol of protein. The protein binds the ligand in its monomeric form. Calculated dissociation constants were 2 X 10(-7) M for unsaturated fatty acids and 5 X 10(-7) M for stearic acid. The binding was specific; other hydrophobic molecules, as retinoic acid, progesterone, prostaglandins, and long-chain alcohols and aldehydes did not bind to the protein. Short-chain fatty acids did not bind to the protein. Ch21, also present in chicken serum, represents the first extracellular protein able to selectively bind and transport fatty acid in extracellular fluids and serum. We propose to rename the Ch21 protein as extracellular fatty acid-binding protein (Ex-FABP)."

We previously demonstrated that heterologous desensitization of the receptor by protein kinase C correlated with phosphorylation in a 33-amino acid-long segment of the receptor carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Here, we determined that the in vivo sites of phosphorylation are four serine doublets present at positions 431/432, 441/442, 444/445, and 451/452. In vitro phosphorylation of fusion proteins containing mutant receptor C-tails, however, indicated that whereas serines at position 431/432 were good substrates for protein kinase C (PKC), serines 444/445 and 451/452 were poor substrates, and serines 441/442 were not substrates. In addition, serine 416 was phosphorylated on fusion protein but not in intact cells. This indicated that in vivo a different PKC isoform or a PKC-activated kinase may phosphorylate the receptor. The role of phosphorylation on receptor desensitization was assessed using receptor mutants expressed in COS cells or Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts. Mutation of any single serine doublet to alanines reduced the extent of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced desensitization, whereas substitution of any combination of two serine doublets suppressed it. Our data thus show that the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor can be phosphorylated in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate on four different sites within the cytoplasmic tail. Furthermore, phosphorylation of at least three sites was required for desensitization, although maximal desensitization was only achieved when all four sites were phosphorylated.

[3H]Benziazem reversibly labeled the benzothiazepine (BTZ)-binding domain of partially purified skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels with high affinity (Kd = 12 nM) and photoincorporated into its binding domain with high yield (>66%). Antibody mapping of proteolytic labeled fragments revealed specific labeling of regions associated with transmembrane segments S6 in repeats III and IV. More than 50% of the labeling was found in the tryptic fragment alanine 1023-lysine 1077 containing IIIS6 together with extracellular and intracellular amino acid residues. The remaining labeling was identified in a second site comprising segment S6 in repeat IV and adjacent residues. Unlike for dihydropyridines, no labeling was observed in the connecting IIIS5-IIIS6 linker. The [3H]benziazem photolabeled regions must be in close contact to the drug molecule when bound to the channel. We propose that the determinants for high affinity BTZ binding are located within or in close proximity to segments IIIS6 and/or IVS6.

Therefore the binding domain for BTZs, like for the other main classes of Ca2+ antagonists, must be located in close proximity to pore-forming regions of the channel. Voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels are blocked by different groups of chemically unrelated compounds, termed Ca2+ antagonists. These drugs cause vasodilation and cardiac depression by blocking L-type Ca2+ channels in smooth and cardiac and are used for the therapy of cardiovascular disorders. One of the clinically most widely used Ca2+ antagonist is the benzothiazepine (+)-cis-diltiazem. Like other Ca2+ antagonists (e.g. dihydropyridines and phenylalkylamines (1Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) it interacts with a high affinity binding domain on the pore-forming α1 subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels (2Striessnig J. Scheffauer F.

To gain deeper insight into the mechanisms of L-type channel modulation by Ca2+ antagonists the molecular motifs involved in drug binding must be identified. DHP and PAA interaction sites within the primary structure of L-type α1 subunits were successfully localized by antibody mapping of proteolytic fragments derived from their photoaffinity labeled domains (3Striessnig J.

Within these regions individual amino acid residues participating in drug interaction were then identified using site-directed mutagenesis (6Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J.

As compared to DHPs and PAAs, photoaffinity ligands developed for the BTZ-binding domain display low binding affinity and incorporation yields (2Striessnig J. Scheffauer F. Mitterdorfer J.

Therefore a complete localization of the BTZ-binding domain using photoaffinity labeling and antibody mapping was impossible (10Watanabe T. Kalasz H. Yabana H. Kuniyasu A. Mershon J. Itagaki K.

We report here the synthesis of a novel photoreactive diltiazem derivative (benziazem) that reversibly labels the BTZ-binding domain of partially purified L-type Ca2+ channels with high affinity. Benziazem specifically photoincorporates into the BTZ-binding domain of skeletal muscle α1 subunits with high labeling efficiency. Antibody mapping of photolabeled peptides revealed that the critical determinants of benziazem binding are exclusively localized within regions of α1 that also participate in the formation of the DHP- and PAA-binding domain. Our results suggest that all major classes of Ca2+ antagonists bind within the pore-forming regions of repeats III and IV of L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits. Reagents were obtained from the following sources: L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (TPCK-trypsin, from bovine pancreas), Protein A-Sepharose, and bovine serum albumin (essentially globulin free) from Sigma; endoproteinase Lys-C (Lys-C) from Boehringer Mannheim; prestained molecular weight marker proteins from Bio-Rad (high range) and Life Technologies, Inc. (low range); Amplify from Amersham; digitonin from Biosynth AG (Basel, Switzerland). [3H]Benziazem (Fig. 1) was synthesized by coupling N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-benzoyl dihydrocinnammic acid to the free amino group of a benzazepine precursor ((3R,4R)-cis-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-6-trifluoromethyl-3-hydroxy-1-[[2-[3-aminopropyl]]-2-[1,1,dimethylethoxycarbonyl] amino]ethyl-4-(4-methoxy)phenyl-2H-1-benzazepin-2-one, Ref. 12Brauns T.

The solvent was evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen. To remove the Boc protecting group, 0.1 ml of methylene chloride followed by 0.1 ml of trifluoroacetic acid were added and the mixture incubated for 60 min on ice. Methylene chloride/trifluoroacetic acid were removed under vacuum, the reaction products resuspended in 50 µl of ethanol and then separated on a Silica Gel 60 thin layer plate developed in benzene/methanol/diethylamine (74/25/1). [3H]Benziazem migrated with an RF value of 0.57 ± 0.06 (n = 3). After extraction of the radioactive peak into ethanol more than 50% of the applied radioactivity was recovered as [3H]benziazem. Radioactive benziazem was stored in the dark at −25°C. Polyclonal anti-α1 antisera were raised in rabbits against synthetic Ca2+ channel peptides corresponding to residues 339-354 (α1339-354), 679-692 (α1679-692), 1011-1026 (α11011-1026), 1025-1040 (α11025-1040), 1066-1082 (α11066-1082), 1339-1354 (α11339-1354), and 1382-1400 (α11382-1400) of the skeletal muscle α1 subunit (3Striessnig J.

Fusion proteins were purified by chelate affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA resin, Qiagen) and used for immunization. Binding experiments with [3H]benziazem were performed as described (15Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 513-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin (0.5 ml final assay volume). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 µM Bz-BAZ (for chemical structure, see Ref. 12Brauns T. Cai Z.-W. Kimball D. Kang H.-C. Haugland R.P. Berger W. Berjukov S. Hering S.

For binding inhibition experiments ligand and protein concentrations were 1.2-1.4 nM and 5.6 µg/ml, respectively. After incubation, the assay mixture was cooled on melting ice for 5 min. One mg of bovine serum albumin and γ-globulin were added followed by 4 ml of a solution containing 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 10 mM MgCl2. After precipitation of the labeled complexes for 3 min on ice, free ligand was removed by filtration over GF/C Whatman filters. Filters were washed 5 times with ice-cold buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and then counted for radioactivity. Ca2+ channels were solubilized in digitonin and partially purified by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 4B, as described (16Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 4: 210-229Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One to three milligrams of affinity purified protein was incubated with 3.5-4.5 nM [3H]benziazem in a final volume of 20-40 ml for 90 min at 25°C in the absence or presence of 10 µM unlabeled competitor (Bz-BAZ) to determine nonspecific binding and photolabeling. Reversible binding prior to photolabeling was determined by filtration (15Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 513-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) of 200-µl aliquots of the incubation mixture. Samples were transferred to siliconized glass Petri dishes and irradiated for 90 min at 4°C with ultraviolet light (Philips 38W/TL black light lamp) at a distance of 25 mm. Photolabeled samples were dialyzed against deionized water at room temperature for 12 h and lyophilized. Dialyzed and lyophilized samples were reduced for 15 min at 57°C with 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol in the presence of 1.6% (w/v) SDS and 400 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) in a final volume of 0.425 ml. Freshly prepared iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of 100 mM. After incubation for 30 min at 22°C the sample was separated by HPLC size exclusion chromatography on a TSK4000SW column eluted with 0.04 M sodium phosphate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (pH 7.2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing the radiolabeled α1 subunit were pooled and subjected to proteolytic cleavage and immunoprecipitation. α1 subunits were digested with Lys-C (1.6 units/ml) in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 2.6 M urea for 12-16 h at 37°C. For TPCK-trypsin digestion, photolabeled α1 subunits were incubated with trypsin (10 µg/ml final concentration) in 60 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 0.03% (w/v) SDS for 2 h at 37°C. An aliquot of the digest was removed for direct SDS-PAGE analysis (non-immunoprecipitated control). Digestion was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation experiments the mixtures were boiled in 0.5% (w/v) SDS for 3 min. The samples were then adjusted to 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (w/v) SDS (or 0.5% (w/v) urea), bovine serum albumin (0.5-1 mg/ml), 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Sequence directed antibodies were bound to Protein A-Sepharose 4B by incubating 1-3 volumes of serum with 1 volume of swollen gel in radioimmunoassay buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 22°C. The Sepharose was washed with ice-cold radioimmunoassay buffer before digested or nondigested samples were added. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature immunoprecipitated radioactivity was either determined directly by liquid scintillation counting of the washed Protein A-Sepharose pellet or analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Nondigested α1 subunit was analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels (17Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For separation of the digested fragments the gel system described by Schägger and Jagow (18Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar) (4% stacking gels, 10% spacer gels, and 16.5% separating gels, 3 or 6% cross-linking) was used. Labeled peptides were either detected by fluorography of dried gels after impregnation with Amplify or by gel-slicing (3 mm slices) as described (3Striessnig J. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl.

Analysis of equilibrium and kinetic binding experiments was as described previously (12Brauns T. Cai Z.-W. Kimball D. Kang H.-C. Haugland R.P. Berger W. Berjukov S. Hering S. Glossmann H.

To obtain a photoaffinity ligand we introduced a tritiated photoreactive benzophenone moiety (13Olszewski I.D. Dorman G. Elliott J.T. Hong Y. Ahern D.G. Prestwich G.D.

As shown in Fig. 2, the resulting compound, [3H]benziazem (35 Ci/mmol), bound reversibly and with high affinity (Kd = 11.9 ± 1.85 nM, Bmax = 361 ± 92 pmol/mg protein) to partially purified skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels. Binding was completely blocked by (+)-cis-diltiazem (IC50 = 2.6 ± 1.7 µM, n = 3) and the more potent diltiazem derivative Bz-BAZ (IC50 = 21.0 ± 4.5 nM, n = 3) (12Brauns T. Cai Z.-W. Kimball D.

At 22°C the DHP (+)-isradipine (1 µM) dramatically slowed (10-18-fold, n = 2) [3H]benziazem dissociation kinetics.

Irradiation of [3H]benziazem-channel complexes resulted in efficient photoaffinity labeling under our experimental conditions. More than 66% (n = 8, Fig. 2B) of the reversibly bound ligand was irreversibly incorporated into the α1 subunit after irradiation with ultraviolet light as determined by immunoprecipitation of labeled α1 subunits (Fig. 2B). Labeling was absent when 10 µM unlabeled competitor (Bz-BAZ) were included in the binding reaction (Fig. 2, B and C). SDS-PAGE also revealed that photolabeling occurred into the α1 subunit without labeling of nonspecific bands (Fig. 2C). Taken together, [3H]benziazem represents a novel high affinity probe for the BTZ-binding domain of L-type Ca2+ channels. To localize the sites of photolabeling within the α1 subunit we followed an antibody mapping approach employed previously for the DHP- and PAA-binding domain (3Striessnig J. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10769-10773Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Nakayama H. Taki M. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Catterall W.A. Kanaoka Y. Proc. Natl.

Specifically photolabeled α1 subunits were subjected to proteolytic digestion with specific proteases (endoproteinase Lys-C or TPCK-trypsin). The digested photolabeled fragments were then probed by immunoprecipitation with a series of sequence-directed antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 5) against different regions of α1. The proteolytic digestion of α1 with endoproteinase Lys-C (Lys-C) is illustrated in Fig. 3. Lys-C digestion resulted in labeled fragments migrating around the 29 and 14.3-kDa marker (Fig. 3A). Together these fragments contained 115.8 ± 18% (n = 6) of the α1-associated radioactivity as determined by gel slicing. Labeled 28.6 ± 1.6 (n = 7) and 14.2 ± 0.7 kDa (n = 7) polypeptides were reproducibly observed (Fig. 3A). In some experiments additional labeled bands appeared at about 35 (n = 3, Fig. 3, lane 1) and 22 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 2). 62 ± 7% of the recovered radioactivity was found in the 14.2-kDa peak and 38 ± 7 kDa in the larger peptides. Immunoprecipitation with sequence-directed antibodies revealed that only antibodies directed against epitopes located near segments S6 in repeats III (anti-α11011-1026, anti-α11025-1040, and anti-α11066-1082) and IV (anti-α11339-1354, anti-α11382-1400, and anti-α11290-1356) immunoprecipitated the photolabeled fragments (Fig. 3B). Other antibodies against the S5-S6 linker in domain I (anti-α1219-309), the cytoplasmic side of IS6 (anti-α1339-354), and the cytoplasmic linker between repeats II and III (anti-α1679-692) efficiently bound α1 but failed to immunoprecipitate Lys-C fragments (not shown). In at least three independent experiments about 68-74% of the α1-associated labeling was associated with fragments recognized by anti-α11011-1026 and anti-α11025-1040 (Fig. 3B). The epitopes of these antibodies are located in the IIIS5-IIIS6 linker and do not contain, nor are they separated by, Lys-C cleavage sites. In the same digests the repeat IV antibodies anti-α11339-1354 and anti-α11382-1400 bound 40-46%. The fact that a smaller percentage of radioactivity was recognized by domain IV antibodies suggested that they were immunoprecipitating the 28.6-kDa band. This was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of antibody-bound radioactivity. Anti-α11382-1400 (Fig. 3, A and C) and anti-α11290-1356 (n = 3, not shown) selectively immunoprecipitated the 28.6- and (when present) 22-kDa fragments. As the intracellular α11382-1400 epitope is located within a single Lys-C fragment that also contains IVS6 and extracellular residues these peptides must represent partial digestion products containing segment IVS6 together with adjacent extra- and intracellular sequence stretches. Anti-α11011-1026 (Fig. 3D) failed to recognize the larger fragments but immunoprecipitated the labeled 14.2-kDa polypeptide. A Lys-C fragment of approximately this mass containing the α11011-1026 epitope must result from cleavage at lysines in positions 962 or 976 and lysines 1077 or 1083 (calculated masses 12-14.5 kDa). Such a fragment contains at least half of the IIIS5-IIIS6 linker, IIIS6 and 12-18 cytoplasmic amino acid residues. Antibody anti-α11066-1082 recognized variable amounts of total specific photolabeling (Fig. 3B) in Lys-C digests. This indicates at least partial cleavage at lysine 1077, resulting in removal of a portion of this antibody's epitope. As the Lys-C fragments also contain trypsin cleavage sites the photolabeled α1 subunits were digested with TPCK-trypsin (10 µg/ml) to further restrict the sites of photolabeling. SDS-PAGE revealed two small photolabeled tryptic fragments with apparent molecular masses of 8.8 ± 0.9 and 7.1 ± 0.5 kDa (n = 4). A fluorogram of a gel where these peaks were clearly separated is shown in Fig. 4A. The α1-associated [3H]benziazem photolabeling was quantitatively recovered (n = 3) in these peaks. In experiments with at least three different α1 preparations, tryptic digests revealed no smaller photolabeled polypeptides (Fig. 4, A and C). The larger peptide must be derived from the 22-35-kDa Lys-C fragments as it was selectively immunoprecipitated by anti-α11382-1400 (Fig. 4, A and C). The other repeat IV antibodies (anti-α11339-1354 and anti-α11290-1356) also immunoprecipitated radioactivity from the same tryptic digests to a similar extent (Fig. 4D). The labeled peptide must therefore contain IVS6 together with adjacent extracellular and cytoplasmic amino acid residues resulting most likely from cleavage at lysine 1336 and lysines in positions 1403 or 1414 (calculated molecular masses 7.9-9.2 kDa). In contrast, the 7.1-kDa tryptic fragment was immunoprecipitated by repeat III antibody anti-α11066-1082 (Fig. 4, B and C). Similar fractions of α1 photolabeling were recognized by anti-α11025-1040 (Fig. 4, B and D) whereas anti-α11011-1026 failed to immunoprecipitate significant amounts of peptide-associated labeling after tryptic digestion (as did control antibodies anti-α1219-309 and anti-α1339-354, Fig. 4D). Therefore cleavage occurred at the C-terminal end of epitope α11011-1026 at arginine 1022. According to our molecular mass estimate, the C-terminal cleavage site most likely corresponds to Lys-1083 (calculated molecular mass 7.2 kDa). Fig. 5 shows the approximate position of the smallest photolabeled tryptic fragments within the proposed folding structure of α1. We synthesized [3H]benziazem as a novel photoaffinity probe to selectively label the BTZ-binding domain with high yield. Specifically photolabeled proteolytic fragments derived from this domain contained transmembrane segments S6 of repeats III and IV together with extracellular and intracellular sequence stretches. Residues within these regions must therefore be in close contact with the bound drug molecule. A preliminary study (10Watanabe T. Kalasz H. Yabana H. Kuniyasu A. Mershon J. Itagaki K. Vaghy P.L. Naito K. Nakayama H. Schwartz A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) of photolabeling by azidobutyryl clentiazem, a photoaffinity probe with much lower affinity and labeling efficiency, also implicated the S5-S6 region of repeat IV in benzothiazepine binding, but the labeled peptides could not be specifically identified by SDS-PAGE and characterized because of the low level of specific labeling. Nevertheless, this earlier work adds further support for our conclusion that a component of the benz(othi)azepine receptor site is located in transmembrane segment S6 of domain IV. Previous functional studies revealed that a membrane-permeable diltiazem analogue can access its site only via an extracellular permeation pathway (24Hering S. Savchenko A. Strübing C. Lakitsch M. Striessnig J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 820-826PubMed Google Scholar, 25Seydl K. Kimball D. Schindler H. Romanin C. Pflügers Arch. 1993; 424: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the high affinity BTZ-binding domain is formed by residues within the photolabeled regions that can be accessed from the extracellular surface of the α1 subunit. Investigation of the molecular organization of the local anaesthetic binding domain of voltage-gated Na+-channels has shown that residues not directly involved in high affinity drug binding in segment IVS6 control drug access to the adjacent binding site (26Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). This indicates that drug access involves steric interactions with amino acids near the drug-binding domains. It is therefore possible that [3H]benziazem not only photoaffinity labels high affinity determinants for BTZ interaction but also adjacent residues modifying drug access to the binding domain. As only one high affinity BTZ-binding domain exists on L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits, the photolabeled regions must be located in close proximity to each other in the folded structure of α1. This closely resembles the topology of the DHP-binding domain, where high affinity determinants for drug interaction are also provided by repeats III and IV including the respective S6 segments (3Striessnig J.

Accordingly, the [3H]benziazem labeled fragments were also found to be photolabeled by different DHPs (3Striessnig J. Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10769-10773Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, PAAs only seem to bind to residues within IVS6 (6Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8Döring F. Degtiar V.E. Grabner M. Striessnig J. Hering S. Glossmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11745-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Considering that S6 segments are believed to contribute to the lining of the ion conducting pathway (6Hockerman G.H. Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22119-22122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1724-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), our data indicate that the binding domains for the three major classes of Ca2+ antagonists are located in close proximity to each other within pore-forming regions of L-type channel α1 subunits. Antibody mapping of DHP photolabeled α1 subunit also revealed labeling within the connecting linker between segments S5 and S6 in repeat III resulting in a labeled 3-4-kDa tryptic peptide. Experiments with chimeric α1 subunits recently confirmed the importance of this region to confer DHP sensitivity (7Grabner M. Wang Z. Hering S. Striessnig J. Glossmann H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 207-218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We found no evidence for [3H]benziazem labeling of this fragment that should be recognized by anti-α11011-1026. Similar to the bulky photoreactive side chains of DHP photoligands (27Glossmann H. Ferry D.R. Striessnig J. Goll A. Moosburger K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 95-100Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the relatively flexible (see legend to Fig. 1) photoreactive benzophenone group may reach even more peripheral residues of the BTZ-binding domain. Based on the absence of photolabeling in the IIIS5-IIIS6 linker in repeat III it therefore appears unlikely that this region contains major determinants for high affinity BTZ interaction. Although identical tryptic fragments are photolabeled by DHPs and [3H]benziazem, the respective binding domains are not identical. In radioligand binding studies non-competitive interactions have been described between DHP and BTZ binding that require DHP and BTZ binding to the channel at the same time resulting in the formation of a ternary complex (1Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Allosteric interactions have originally been proposed to account for these effects (1Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 114: 1-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the close association of all three binding domains within pore-forming regions of the channel may also allow steric interactions between these drugs. We have previously obtained evidence for an isosteric interaction between DHPs and BTZs in studies with the fluorescent Ca2+ antagonist DMBODIPY-BAZ (12Brauns T. Cai Z.-W. Kimball D. Kang H.-C. Haugland R.P. Berger W. Berjukov S. Hering S. Glossmann H. Striessnig J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3461-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Brauns T. Striessnig J. Prinz H. Cai Z.-W. Kimball S.D. Kang H.-C. Haugland R.P. Berjukov S. Hering S. Glossmann H. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A258Google Scholar). The effects of the DHP (+)-isradipine on DMBODIPY-BAZ binding and fluorescence suggested that these drugs are located in close proximity to each other when simultaneously bound to the α1 subunit in a ternary complex. Our biochemical findings further support such a model. Taken together we demonstrate that pore-forming regions of L-type Ca2+ channel α1 subunits in repeats III and IV provide a “hot spot” for the binding and action of chemically unrelated Ca2+ antagonists. Refining the structural organization of this region may not only help to provide insight into the molecular mechanism of Ca2+ antagonist action but may also aid in the development of organic channel blockers against other types of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. We thank D. Ostler and E. Penz for expert technical assistance, Dr. T. Brauns for assistance in [3H]benziazem synthesis, Dr. D. Reimer for partially purified Ca2+ channels, Dr. F. F. Moebius for helpful discussion, and H. Glossmann for critical comments on the manuscript and continuous support."

The molecular basis of canine M-PFK deficiency, the only naturally occurring animal homologue, was investigated.

The affected dogs have a chronic compensated hemolytic disorder and exertional myopathy, as is seen in human patients. However, these animals most often present with hemolytic crises due to the high capacity of the dog for aerobic work and the intrinsic alkaline fragility of erythrocytes (7Giger U. Reilly M.P.

Patterson D.F. Giger U. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 168: 275-276Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), making it possible to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of canine M-PFK deficiency. We identified a single nonsense mutation that leads to rapid degradation of an unstable truncated M-PFK protein. Unless otherwise indicated, tissue and blood samples for PFK studies were obtained from a colony of English springer spaniels, founded and maintained at the School of Veterinary Medicine, the University of Pennsylvania. The M-PFK-deficient animals used to create this colony originated from Wisconsin, Maryland, and Indiana. The pedigrees of the three founding families have no common ancestor for at least six generations (11Guixe V. Babul J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All animals were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. Muscle samples for PFK activity assays, protein studies, and RNA isolation were obtained by surgical biopsy of pentobarbital- and halothane-anesthetized dogs or by sterile excision post-mortem. These tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C. Blood samples anticoagulated with EDTA were kept on ice until used for PFK enzyme activity assays and DNA extraction. Animals were considered to be PFK-deficient (affected), carriers (heterozygous asymptomatic), or normal based on erythrocyte and muscle PFK activities and pedigree analysis (9Vora S. Giger U. Turchen S. Harvey J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8109-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunoblots of M-PFK were prepared as described previously (12Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Sebo T. Trapp R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 µg of total protein was run on a 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a 0.45-µm nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk powder and was probed with guinea pig anti-rabbit M-PFK antiserum (12Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Sebo T. Trapp R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Primary canine myoblasts were obtained and cultured from a normal and an M-PFK-deficient dog, as described previously (13Smith B.F. Hoffman R.K. Giger U. Wolfe J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3268-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The myoblasts were plated at high density (approximately 1.25 × 103/mm2) and allowed to differentiate and form myotubes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. The medium was removed, and the adherent cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Minimum essential medium (Eagle's medium-deficient) (Sigma), supplemented with L-leucine, L-lysine, and sodium bicarbonate, but without methionine, was added for 30 min. The medium was removed and deficient medium (above) supplemented with [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) at 5.5 µCi/ml was added for 18 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and either harvested or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was added for periods of up to 24 h. M-PFK was then immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-dog M-PFK antibody as described and visualized by 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by autoradiography (12Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Sebo T. Trapp R. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Mhaskar Y. Giger U. Dunaway G.A.

Total muscle RNA was prepared from a PFK-deficient English springer spaniel and a normal beagle by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi and was subjected to formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis (15Nakajima H. Noguchi T. Yamasaki T. Kono N. Tanaka T. Tarui S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred by capillary action onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Corp.) and fixed to the membrane in a UV light cross-linking apparatus (Stratolinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots of total muscle RNA were probed with the full-length canine M-PFK cDNA (PCRPFKd4) (10Smith B.F. Henthorn P.S. Rajpurohit Y. Stedman H. Wolfe J.H. Patterson D.F. Giger U. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 168: 275-276Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) for 18 h at 55°C, washed at 60°C in 1 × SSC, and exposed to x-ray film. Total muscle RNA prepared as described above was used to make a cDNA library. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Collaborative Research, type III). A cDNA library was constructed using this mRNA in the Lambda ZAP II vector (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 1 × 105 plaques constituting the entire primary plating of the M-PFK-deficient canine cDNA library were lifted on nitrocellulose membranes and screened using a full-length human M-PFK cDNA, HMPFK2, or the 5′ or 3′ EcoRI fragments of HMPFK2 (10Smith B.F. Henthorn P.S. Rajpurohit Y. Stedman H. Wolfe J.H. Patterson D.F. Giger U. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 168: 275-276Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Positive clones were plaque purified and excised in vivo into the plasmid form, according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA from an affected male dog was synthesized using 2 µg of total skeletal muscle RNA prepared as for the Northern blot, or mRNA from the same preparation that was used to construct the cDNA library (15Nakajima H. Noguchi T. Yamasaki T. Kono N. Tanaka T. Tarui S. FEBS Lett. 1987; 223: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Primers with the sequences gaGCGGCCGCtcatgacccatgaagagc (PFKNot) containing the start codon (underlined, lower case, bold), and cgCTCGAGcacagtgaccagttggcat (PFKXho) were designed with homology to M-PFK (lower case, bold) and NotI or XhoI restriction sites (upper case). These primers were used to amplify oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA with a reaction profile of 40 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 3.5 min at 72°C. The PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, electroeluted, serially digested with NotI and XhoI, and ligated into NotI/XhoI-digested Bluescript II phagemid (Stratagene). Sequencing reactions were performed on double-stranded and single-stranded DNA templates according to a modification of the Sanger dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method, both manually and with an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc. model 373A automated sequencer at the DNA Facility, the School of Veterinary Medicine, of the University of Pennsylvania) (16Wills K.N.

In areas covered by PCR-derived clones, sequence from clones representing three separate PCR reactions was obtained. Genomic DNA was harvested from 100 µl of EDTA-anticoagulated blood as described (17Mehta J. Chopra J.S. Mehta S. Nain C.K. Bhagwat A.G. Dhand U.K. Rana S.V. Ann. Nutr. Metab. 1987; 31: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Amplification of 5-10% of this DNA was performed using primers with the sequence ctggggatgcgtaagagggctctgg (PFKexon21) and gaggatgggcctcagcttcaggcac (PFKBan) which correspond to bases 2137-2161 of the coding sequence and bases 2229-2253 of the non-coding strand, respectively. The predicted size of the product of amplification with the PFKexon21/PFKBan primer set was 326 base pairs, based on 116 base pairs in exons 21 and 22 and the rabbit muscle intron length of 210 base pairs (18Roberts S.J. Somero G.N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Newton P.A. Hamer M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 1106-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Following a PCR amplification profile of 9 min at 95°C, 5 cycles of 1 min at 95°C and 1 min at 55°C, and 35 cycles of 1 min at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C, the product of predicted size was purified by sequential phenol and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) extractions. After ethanol precipitation, one-half of the product was digested with the restriction endonuclease BanI and electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide, 1 × TBE gel. The PCR product was visualized on a UV transilluminator after staining with ethidium bromide. Human genomic DNA was not amplified by this primer set under these conditions. SDS-PAGE of skeletal muscle extracts from normal, carrier, and M-PFK-deficient English springer spaniels, as determined by total erythrocyte PFK activity, were prepared and stained for total protein. A band of ∼85 kDa, which was present in normal dogs, was absent in affected dogs (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 3). An 85-kDa band of reduced (approximately one-half) intensity was seen in muscle from carrier dogs (Fig. 1A, lane 2). To determine whether the 85-kDa band corresponded to M-PFK, similar gels were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized with a guinea pig anti-rabbit M-PFK antibody known to cross-react with M-PFK subunits from a variety of mammalian species (20Lee C.P. Kao M.C. French B.A. Putney S.D. Chang S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4195-4199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An 85-kDa protein was present in muscle extracts from normal dogs (Fig. 1B, lane 1). In contrast, no band was detected in affected individuals (Fig. 1B, lane 3), and a band of approximately half-normal intensity was seen in carriers (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Pulse-chase labeling of primary muscle cell cultures followed by immunoprecipitation with an M-PFK-specific antibody indicated that protein was present for at least 24 h (half-life, ∼18 h) in normal dogs (Fig. 1C). No immunoprecipitated protein was seen in myotubes from affected dogs, even immediately after labeling (Fig. 1C, lane 7). A second pulse-chase labeling with 20 times as much label added for only 30 min resulted in a faint band being visible at chase times up to 2 h in affected dogs. A Northern blot of total RNA was performed on muscle samples taken from a normal and an affected dog (Fig. 2). The M-PFK transcript from both normal and affected dogs measured ∼2.8 kilobases, and the amount of M-PFK transcript in affected muscle appeared to be greater than normal. The amount of mRNA was not quantified due to the large number of possible variables affecting gene expression in muscle, such as age, physical condition, and breed. Based on this information, canine M-PFK deficiency was thought to be most likely due to a missense or nonsense mutation within the coding sequence, which would account for the absence of the M-PFK protein and activity and the rapid turnover of the protein. To determine the genetic basis of this disease, a skeletal muscle cDNA library was created from an affected male dog using the Lambda ZAP II vector. Clone PFKd13a was the longest clone isolated from the M-PFK-deficient library, starting at a position corresponding to base 1426 of the human sequence and containing a polyadenylation site and poly(A) tail. Rescreening of this cDNA library failed to yield any additional clones containing the sequence between the first base and the start of PFKd13a. M-PFK clones containing the remaining 5′ region were generated using PCR of affected muscle cDNA and sequenced. Comparison of the sequences of the open reading frames from normal and affected dogs revealed a single difference at position 2228. This alteration, from a guanosine in the normal dog to an adenosine in the affected dog, resulted in an amber codon (UAG) replacing the normal tryptophan codon (UGG) and caused the termination of translation 40 amino acid residues before the normal termination codon (Fig. 3). The mutant canine sequence contained the termination codon TAA at the same location as the normal canine, rabbit, and human stop codon sequences. The mutation in the affected dog neither created nor abolished a known restriction enzyme recognition sequence. For this reason, an allele-specific test was designed for the mutation using the normal base in combination with a PCR primer (PFKBan) that introduced a mismatch to create a restriction enzyme recognition site (Fig. 4A). Genomic DNA from dogs whose PFK status was known from enzyme assay was amplified with the primer set PFKexon21/PFKBan, digested with BanI, and evaluated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The PCR product from normal dogs was completely digested, and it migrated in a position (310 base pairs) ∼25 nucleotides smaller than the undigested product (Fig. 4B, lane 5). In contrast, BanI-digested PCR product from affected individuals showed no change in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Carriers had bands of reduced intensity at both positions, when compared with normal or affected dogs (Fig. 4B, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6). Thus, the PFKexon21/PFKBan assay allowed the number of normal alleles at position 2228 to be determined, thereby permitting carrier animals to be distinguished from normal and affected dogs. Twenty-one of the dogs in our colony for which enzyme activities were available were evaluated utilizing the PFKexon21/PFKBan primer set. Since this colony was derived from three separate families of dogs with no relatives in common for the previous six generations, segregation of this mutation with the disease would strongly support its causative role. Five normal dogs, eight carrier dogs, and eight affected dogs were evaluated, and the correlation between enzyme activity and the number of normal alleles was complete. Fig. 4B shows PCR results from a typical mating between two carriers which produced one affected puppy, one normal puppy, and two carrier puppies. Because M-PFK deficiency is a common inherited disorder in the English springer spaniel (5Giger U. Harvey J.W. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 1987; 191: 453-459PubMed Google Scholar, 6Giger U. Harvey J.W. Yamaguchi R.A. McNulty P.K. Chiapella A. Beutler E. Blood. 1985; 65: 345-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Giger U. Reilly M.P. Asakura T. Baldwin C.J. Harvey J.W. Anim. Genet. 1986; 17: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we examined 35 samples from animals outside of the colony for M-PFK deficiency with the allele-specific PCR-based test. Of these dogs, 23 were English springer spaniels, 3 were American cocker spaniels, and 9 were breeds other than spaniels from which blood samples were submitted as normal controls for PFK enzyme activity assays. Twenty-two of these samples were submitted because the animal had been suffering from chronic or recurrent regenerative anemia and/or exercise intolerance, for breeding evaluation, or because the animal was related to an affected dog. Five English springer spaniels were shown to be homozygous, and three were heterozygous for the G to A mutation. An American cocker spaniel dog, with hemolytic anemia, was examined by this technique and found to have no normal M-PFK alleles (21Trigun S.K. Singh S.N. Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr. 1988; 7: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Subsequent sequencing confirmed that the disease in this American cocker spaniel was due to the same mutation that causes the disease in the English springer spaniel breed (data not shown). Canine M-PFK deficiency represents the only disease model of this autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in humans. The clinicopathological similarities of the exertional myopathy and erythroenzymopathy in both species have been reported (7Giger U. Reilly M.P. Asakura T. Baldwin C.J. Harvey J.W. Anim. Genet. 1986; 17: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Vora S. Giger U. Turchen S. Harvey J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8109-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our studies characterize the molecular basis of M-PFK deficiency in dogs and suggest that canine PFK deficiency is an excellent disease homologue to further investigate pathogenesis and novel therapeutic approaches. When compared with the previously reported cDNA sequence from normal dogs (10Smith B.F. Henthorn P.S. Rajpurohit Y. Stedman H. Wolfe J.H. Patterson D.F. Giger U. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 168: 275-276Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the coding sequence from affected dogs showed only a single base substitution of an A to G at position 2228 which changes a tryptophan codon to a stop codon, thereby truncating the M-PFK subunit by 40 amino acid residues. No other alterations were found in the protein-coding region compared to normal M-PFK. PCR testing of the region of the mutation established an absolute correlation between the number of mutant alleles and normal, intermediate (carrier), and deficient PFK activity in all individuals tested, further supporting the causative nature of this mutation. Thus far, only very few canine and other large animal models have been defined at the molecular genetic level. From among the >50 M-PFK-deficient humans, several mutations have been identified, but none have exactly the same genetic defect as in dogs. A splicing defect that results in recognition of a cryptic splice site within exon 15 and an in frame 75-base pair deletion in the mRNA has been found in a Japanese family (2Nakajima H. Kono N. Yamasaki T. Hotta K. Kawachi M. Kuwajima M. Noguchi T. Tanaka T. Tarui S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9392-9395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Ashkenazi Jews, the most commonly reported mutations are at the splice donor site of intron 5, leading to a precise deletion of exon 5, and a single base deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation in exon 22 and a premature stop codon (3Sherman J.B. Raben N. Nicastri C. Argov C. Nakajima H. Adams E.M. Eng C.M. Cowan T.M. Plotz P.H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 55: 305-313PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to the one we found in deficient dogs. In addition, missense mutations have been reported in French Canadian and Swiss patients (4Raben N. Exelbert R. Spiegel R. Sherman J.B. Nakajima H. Plotz P. Heinisch J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar). The information regarding the enzyme defect at the protein level is very limited in human patients. Generally, M-PFK enzyme activity is nearly completely lacking in muscle tissue and reduced to one-half in erythrocytes, due to the contribution of L-PFK. The amino acid substitution in M-PFK found in a French Canadian patient resulted in a completely inactive protein, whereas the missense mutations in a double-heterozygote Swiss patient only modestly changed the enzyme activity and thermal stability as shown in a yeast expression system (4Raben N. Exelbert R. Spiegel R. Sherman J.B. Nakajima H. Plotz P. Heinisch J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar). No structure-function studies have, thus far, been performed with normal and mutant canine M-PFK. Our data for the dog show that the 40-amino acid deletion caused by the mutation, representing only 5% of the protein, has a profound effect on the assembly and stability of the molecule. The lack of this region apparently leads to the rapid degradation of the entire subunit, since the half-life of the mutant M-PFK was drastically shortened. The region deleted by this mutation corresponds to a sequence that forms an α helix in Bacillus stearothermophilus (22Anneren G. Epstein C.J. Upsala J. Med. Sci. 1988; 93: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), as determined by x-ray crystallography, and is highly conserved in canine (10Smith B.F. Henthorn P.S. Rajpurohit Y. Stedman H. Wolfe J.H. Patterson D.F. Giger U. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 168: 275-276Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and other mammalian (20Lee C.P. Kao M.C. French B.A. Putney S.D. Chang S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4195-4199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sharma P.M. Reddy G.R. Vora S. Babior B.M. McLachlan A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) M-PFKs. In Escherichia coli, this region has been shown to be critical to the stability of the tetramer and the individual subunit (24Le Bras G. Garel J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2490-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When 1 of 4 subunits was truncated by 40 amino acids, the tetramer was no longer stable in the absence of fructose 6-phosphate. The incorporation of two truncated subunits resulted in the loss of allosteric regulation (24Le Bras G. Garel J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2490-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Chou-Fasman analysis of this sequence of human, rabbit, and canine M-PFKs for α-helical content indicates that the mutation interrupts a region which is highly likely to form an α helix in mammalian M-PFK (25Levanon D. Danciger E. Dafni N. Groner Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Trigun S.K. Singh S.N. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1987; 33: 767-774PubMed Google Scholar). No amino acid residues in this terminal α helix correspond to amino acids known to be involved in the active site or effector site (27Lau F.T. Fersht A.R. Hellinga H.W. Evans P.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4143-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Buschmeier B. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. J. Biol.

Genet. 1992; 89: 105-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis of the normal canine amino acid sequence demonstrates that this region is hydrophilic (31Rypniewski W.R. Evans P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 805-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The combination of the potential of this region for α-helical structure and its hydrophilicity and terminal location suggest that it may be involved in subunit recognition or interaction in the formation of tetramers or in subunit stability. In contrast to muscle, partially purified extracts of PFK from the erythrocytes and brains of affected dogs showed very small amounts of a lower molecular weight band that was hypothesized to be the truncated M-PFK subunit (14Mhaskar Y. Giger U. Dunaway G.A. Enzyme. 1991; 45: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which has an apparent molecular mass of 84 kDa (32Crepin K.M. Darville M.I. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Noble N.A. Xu Q.P. Ward J.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 475-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is 3.3 kDa larger than the predicted molecular weight from the DNA sequence; however, the mobility of proteins in polyacrylamide gels may be affected by factors other than molecular weight, such as glycosylation (34Mandarino L.J. Wright K.S. Verity L.S. Nichols J. Bell J.M. Kolterman O.G. Beck Nielsen H. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The reason for the apparent greater stability of the truncated subunit in these tissues than in muscle is unclear; however, the lack of enzymatic M-PFK activity appears to be unaffected by the tissue source. One possible explanation for this apparent difference in stabilities is that erythrocytes and brain contain other subunits, while muscle expresses only M-PFK subunits, and the mutant M-PFK molecular may be partially stabilized by complexing with L- and P-PFK subunits in erythrocytes and brain cells. The low residual PFK activity found in muscle (1-4%) could be caused by the mutant M-PFK. Alternatively, there is expression of other PFK isoforms in skeletal muscle (9Vora S. Giger U. Turchen S. Harvey J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8109-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Mhaskar Y. Giger U. Dunaway G.A. Enzyme. 1991; 45: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), because in vitro experiments with C2-C12 myogenic cell lines have shown that L-PFK and P-PFK are expressed in myoblasts and at low levels even after myotube formation, indicating that a low expression of these other isoforms in muscle may account for the residual PFK activity (35Gekakis N. Gehnrich S.C. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3658-3661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To screen for this M-PFK mutation in dogs, we designed an antisense primer with a mismatched nucleotide, located downstream from the mutation site, that created a restriction enzyme cleavage site for BanI in the PCR fragment from the normal, but not in that derived from the mutant sequence. The same mutation was identified in the three English springer spaniels that originated from different parts of the United States and were not related over six generations. Affected offspring from these dogs were homozygous for this mutation, whereas clinically normal animals with half-normal enzymatic PFK activity in muscle and erythrocytes had one normal and one mutant allele. The complete concordance of this mutation in affected and carrier animals and absence in the normal population confirm that it is in fact the deleterious mutation and not a polymorphism. The availability of this simple PFK-PCR test eliminates the need for enzyme activity assays and allows population screening. The frequency of this disease in the English springer spaniel breed is likely underestimated because the clinical manifestations of myopathy and hemolysis are intermittent and thus may be mistakenly presumed to be due to acquired diseases. We are grateful to Drs. George A. Dunnaway, Robert G. Kemp, Dirk Pette, and Franz Weber for their assistance with immunoblots and immunoprecipitations using antibodies to M-PFK."

While this process has been studied extensively in fungal and mammalian systems, little work has been done in other eukaryotic organisms.

We report here the development of an in vitro import system using crude trypanosome mitochondria and a nuclear encoded, mitochondrial protein. Import of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein subunit of the cytochrome c reductase complex requires a membrane potential, ATP, and a protein component on the mitochondrial surface. The precursor protein is sequentially processed to the mature form in two steps by peptidases that require divalent metal ions for activity. As in other eukaryotic systems, the first processing event occurs inside the inner membrane and is probably catalyzed by a matrix-processing protease. Surprisingly, the second processing activity is located outside the inner membrane. Both processing steps require ATP but are independent of a membrane potential. We suggest that the trypanosome iron-sulfur protein is imported along a “conservative sorting pathway” but that the assembly mechanism of the reductase complex may be unique to trypanosomes.

Most of the proteins associated with the mitochondrion are encoded in the nuclear genome.

Some proteins such as subunit 9 of the F0-ATPase (subunit 9) and the cytochrome c1 and Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) subunits of the cytochrome c reductase complex are imported into the matrix, processed, and then redirected into or across the inner membrane (Mahlke et al., 31Mahlke K.

For subunit 9, ATP is required for the export from the matrix, and a pH gradient is required for the reinsertion of the protein into the inner membrane (Rojo et al., 53Rojo E.E. Stuart R.A.

Precursor proteins imported along this pathway are processed a second time by intermediate peptidases that appear to have different specificities, requirements, and locations. In yeast, the peptidase that cleaves the ISP subunit of the reductase complex, the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), is located on the matrix side of the inner membrane, while the peptidase that cleaves the cytochrome c1 subunit, the inner membrane protease I, is located in the intermembrane space (Fu et al., 8Fu W.

Both peptidases require divalent metal ions for activity, but the metal ion preferences are different (Ramabadran and Beattie, 51Ramabadran R.S. Beattie D.S. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1989; 264: 10156-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the insertion of the iron-sulfur center into the apoprotein is not a prerequisite either for cleavage or for assembly of the ISP into the cytochrome c reductase complex, but heme addition is required for cytochrome c1 maturation (Graham and Trumpower, 11Graham L.A.

During its developmental cycle, Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite of humans and domestic animals, regulates mitochondrial function to coincide with the nutrients available in the mammalian and insect hosts (Vickerman, 67Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We have purified one of the developmentally regulated mitochondrial protein complexes, the cytochrome c reductase, and have cloned two of its subunit proteins, the Rieske ISP and cytochrome c1 (Priest and Hajduk, 46Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20188-20195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1993; 1144: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The trypanosome ISP has a conventional cleaved presequence that may function as a mitochondrial targeting signal, but the cytochrome c1 lacks a presequence (Priest et al., 47Priest J.W. Wood Z.A. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar; Priest and Hajduk, 50Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We suggested that the 17-residue amino-terminal ISP presequence directs import into the trypanosome mitochondrion along a conservative sorting pathway and that it is processed in two steps like the fungal ISP presequences. We report here that a crude mitochondrial fraction prepared from the insect (procyclic) form of T. brucei is able to both import and process in vitro translated trypanosome ISP. The import requires a protein component on the exposed surface of the mitochondrion as well as ATP and a membrane potential. Similar import requirements have recently been reported for T. brucei and Leishmania tarentolae mitochondria following extensive density gradient purification (Hauser et al., 19Hauser R. Pypaert M. Hausler T. Horn E.K. Schneider A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of the import substrates used by Hauser et al., a heterologous yeast mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase and an artificial precursor protein containing the 9-amino acid presequence of the trypanosome dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, were cleaved once (as expected for matrix-localized proteins). However, the cleavage activity was not characterized, nor was its submitochondrial location determined. In our system, the trypanosome ISP precursor is processed in two steps by metalloproteases that reside on opposite sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The processing from the precursor to the mature form does not require a membrane potential but does require a significant amount of ATP in the matrix. The intermembrane space location of the T. brucei ISP intermediate peptidase is different from that described in other eukaryotic systems, suggesting that the assembly pathway of the cytochrome c reductase complex may have some unusual features in trypanosomes. Clone pTbFe/SNsi contains the entire 894-base pair T. brucei Rieske iron-sulfur protein coding sequence as well as 1.3 kilobase pairs of upstream noncoding sequence and 1 kilobase pair of downstream coding sequence (Priest and Hajduk, 50Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ATG initiation codon was moved closer to the plasmid-encoded T7 transcription initiation site by the deletion of a 1.2-kilobase pair HinCII fragment from the 5′-noncoding sequence. A template for transcription of the ISP coding sequence was generated by cleavage of the subclone (pTbFe/SNsiΔHinC) at a BspH I site situated 34 base pair downstream of the termination codon. From this template a 1166-nucleotide RNA was transcribed with a 5′ 7-methyl-GpppG cap (Boehringer Mannheim) using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) (Sambrook et al., 54Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Analysis of the transcript by methyl-mercury-agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrated that essentially all of the RNA was full-length (data not shown). Radiolabeled ISP was synthesized in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte translation system with [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN; approximately 1000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) as directed by the manufacturer (Promega). At an input RNA concentration of 40 ng/µl, each microliter of translation mixture incorporated between 2.9 and 5.7 × 104 cpm into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein. T. brucei procyclic cells (TREU 667) were grown in shaking cultures at 26°C using SSMH medium as described elsewhere (Torri and Hajduk, 62Torri A.F. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar; Priest and Hajduk, 1994a48Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65 (a): 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When the cells reached a density of about 1 × 107 cells/ml, they were collected by centrifugation at 4°C (7100 × g, 15 min) and then washed at 4°C with a buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM glucose, and 20 mM NaH2PO4 at pH 7.4. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4°C unless otherwise indicated. The cells were resuspended at a density of 1 × 109 cells/ml in buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM MOPS/KOH at pH 7.2, and 2 mM EDTA (SME buffer). The cells were equilibrated with 1000 psi N2 for 15 min in a nitrogen cavitation bomb (minibomb cell disruption chamber; Kontes, Vineland, NJ). Release from the bomb resulted in the disruption of greater than 95% of the cells. Dilution of the sample with 1 volume of SME buffer was followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 × g to remove intact cells, cell ghosts, and large cellular debris. A crude mitochondrial fraction was then collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in the original volume of SME buffer and again centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The crude mitochondrial fraction was collected from the 1500 × g supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 3 × 109 cell equivalents/ml (about 2 mg of protein/ml) in storage buffer containing 50% glycerol, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM MOPS/KOH at pH 7.2, and 2 mM EDTA. After homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer (5-10 strokes, B pestle), aliquots were frozen at −70°C. Mitochondrial import activity was stable for several weeks under these conditions. Crude mitochondria in glycerol storage buffer were warmed to 4°C, centrifuged for 3 s at 14,000 × g (12,000 rpm, Sorvall microcentrifuge, Wilmington, DE) to remove aggregated material, and then aliquoted for individual assays. To remove the glycerol storage buffer, crude mitochondria were diluted with 9 volumes of SME buffer and then collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellets were resuspended in import buffer, and the assays were begun by adding radiolabeled rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation mixture. Each 25 µl of assay mixture (final volume) contained the mitochondria from 1.5 × 108 cells (about 100 µg of protein), 5 µl of rabbit reticulocyte translation mixture (20% v/v), and 20 µl of basal import buffer at a final concentration of 0.25 M sucrose, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and 10 mM MOPS/KOH at pH 7.2 (modified from Pfanner and Neupert, 42Pfanner N. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2819-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In most cases additional ATP was provided at a final concentration of 2 mM, and 10 mM creatine phosphate and 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase were added as an ATP regeneration system. In the indicated experiments, 8 mM potassium ascorbate, 0.2 mM N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine, and 5 mM NADH were included to energize the mitochondria and provide reducing equivalents (Pfanner and Neupert, 43Pfanner N. Neupert W. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). “Complete” import buffer contained the additional ATP, the ATP regeneration system, and the reagents to energize the mitochondria. Protein import assays were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Assays were terminated by transfer to 4°C, and the mitochondria-containing fraction was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Where possible, samples that were to be directly compared (i.e. ± proteinase K treatment) were taken from the same import assay mixture with the total volume scaled up appropriately. To remove labeled protein that was bound to the membranes but not imported, the mitochondria-containing pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 3 × 109 cell equivalents/ml in SME buffer, and proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to 30 µg/ml (unless otherwise indicated in the figure legend). Digestion was carried out at room temperature for 15 min. One volume of cold SME buffer containing 4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to terminate the digestion, and the mitochondrial fraction was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting pellet was solubilized by heating for 3 min at 95°C in SDS sample loading buffer with 2 mM PMSF. Mitochondria that were not to be digested with proteinase K were resuspended in cold SME buffer at the same concentration described above. Following dilution with 1 volume of cold SME with 4 mM PMSF, the mitochondrial fraction was collected by centrifugation at 4°C and dissolved in SDS loading buffer as described above. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1972; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Each lane was loaded with the crude mitochondrial protein from 1.2 × 108 cells (80% of the protein from a 25-µl import assay). Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that each lane contained an equivalent protein load. Gels were impregnated with Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL), dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −70°C (X-Omat AR, Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The relative amounts of protected radiolabeled proteins were quantitated by storage phosphor autoradiography using a Molecular Dynamics model 400E PhosphorImager. Protein concentration was measured with the dye binding assay of Bradford (3Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad dye reagent (Richmond, CA). Concentrated stocks of potato apyrase (Grade VIII, 1000 units/ml), fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), and creatine phosphokinase (10 mg/ml) (all from Sigma) were made in 10 mM MOPS/KOH at pH 7.2. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Valinomycin, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), oligomycin, antimycin A, and PMSF were all made as 100-fold concentrated stocks in ethanol. Mitochondria isolation from a kinetoplastid protozoan like T. brucei has been confounded by the fact that each cell has only one large and extensively convoluted mitochondrion (Vickerman, 66Vickerman K. Nature. 1965; 208: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The nitrogen cavitation lysis protocol described in this work was developed to minimize the disruption of the mitochondrion while efficiently lysing the T. brucei procyclic cells. The protocol uses an isotonic buffer to encourage the formation and maintenance of an intact inner mitochondrial membrane during and after lysis, and it is carried out at 4°C to preserve the import competence of the mitochondria. Since the crude mitochondrial fraction from our differential centrifugation was capable of importing between 4 and 22% of the input labeled mitochondrial precursor proteins, further purification was deemed unnecessary. Tubulin from the disrupted flagella was one of the major contaminants in the crude mitochondrial fraction. The tubulin is apparent on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as two large protein bands in the 50-kDa mass range (see Fig. 1A, lane 2). As shown in lane 3 of Fig. 1A, treatment of the mitochondrial fraction with proteinase K at 30 µg/ml removed much of the contamination, yet left many of the other proteins intact. Despite the obvious impurity of our mitochondria, those isolated by our protocol were at least 5-fold more efficient (per mg of protein) at import than mitochondria isolated by the hypotonic lysis and Percoll gradient technique developed earlier in our laboratory (Harris et al., 14Harris M.E. Moore D.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11368-11376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The radiolabeled protein profile of in vitro translated T. brucei Rieske ISP is shown in lane 1 of Fig. 1B. The full-length ISP precursor (35-kDa apparent molecular mass, 33.6 kDa predicted) and a truncation product from translation initiation at an internal methionine (29-kDa apparent molecular mass, 27.6 kDa predicted) were represented in the translation products in approximately a 4:3 ratio (for the sequence of the ISP, see Priest and Hajduk (50Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)). When these proteins were incubated with the mitochondrial fraction described above, both the full-length ISP (p) and the truncation product were recovered with the mitochondria after one wash with buffer (Fig. 1B, lane 2). In addition, two new protein products derived from the full-length ISP precursor were associated with the mitochondria: an intermediate form with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa (i) and a mature form with an apparent molecular mass of 33 (±1) kDa (m). The size of the mature form corresponds to the size of the ISP found in the native cytochrome c reductase complex (32 kDa) and to the 31.6-kDa size predicted from the sequence of the ISP minus the 17-residue cleaved presequence (Priest and Hajduk, 1994a, 1995). Following treatment of the mitochondrial fraction with proteinase K at 30 µg/ml (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 3′), only the two new proteins and a small amount of the precursor remained. The truncated ISP form was completely sensitive to external protease. A total of 7% of the input full-length ISP precursor was recovered in the precursor, intermediate, and mature proteins after protease digestion. The recovery of labeled ISP following incubation with mitochondria cannot be attributed to nonspecific trapping, incomplete protease digestion, or the innate resistance of ISP to digestion. Nonspecific vesicle trapping can be ruled out, since neither the ISP truncation product (which completely lacks the 17-residue cleaved amino-terminal presequence) nor radiolabeled luciferase (data not shown) were protected from protease digestion under the same import conditions. The recovery was also not a result of incomplete protease digestion. An increase in the proteinase K concentration from 30 to 60 µg/ml resulted in only a 15% reduction in the amount of recovered ISP precursor and products (6% overall recovery) (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Lowering the proteinase K to concentration to 15 µg/ml (Fig. 1C, lane 1) increased the recovery of labeled protein from 7 to 11% without changing the ratio of precursor to intermediate and mature forms. The truncated ISP was not apparent even at this lower protease concentration. Since the two smaller products are only generated upon import (see Fig. 4), this result suggests that some of the mitochondria are unstable after extensive manipulation and become permeable to proteinase K. Thus, the estimate of the level of protein import may, in fact, be low. Solubilization of the mitochondrial membranes with CHAPS detergent rendered the ISP precursor and products sensitive to protease digestion even at a proteinase K concentration (15 µg/ml) lower than that routinely used in the import experiments (Fig. 1D, lane 2). The apparent decrease in the recovery of the mature ISP form in the import assay lacking detergent (Fig. 1, compare panel D, lane 1, with panel C, lane 1) is probably an artifact of the acetone precipitation technique used to recover the protein in this experiment. Fig. 2A demonstrates that the accumulation of labeled ISP within a protease-inaccessible compartment of the mitochondrion is time-dependent. Total ISP import (sum of precursor, intermediate, and mature forms) had a t1/2 of approximately 6.5 min and reached a maximum at about 20 min. Although this t1/2 is considerably longer than the t1/2 reported for ISP in yeast (<2 min) (Fu et al., 1990), it is similar to that found for other T. brucei mitochondrial proteins in this system. 2J. W. Priest and S. L. Hajduk, unpublished observations. The order and kinetics of appearance of the precursor ISP and of the two processed products as determined from the gel in Fig. 2A by storage phosphor image quantitation (Fig. 2B) suggest a linear sequence of conversion from precursor to intermediate to mature forms. The precursor began to accumulate immediately after the import reaction was initiated (<1 min), while the intermediate and mature forms were not apparent until after 2.5 min and 5 min of incubation with the mitochondria, respectively. The t1/2 values for the accumulation of the individual ISP forms were 4.5 min for the precursor, 8 min for the intermediate form, and 12 min for the mature form. The t1/2 of the mature form may be an underestimate, since processing continued after 30 min even though import had ceased. These results are consistent with a pathway of precursor ISP import and subsequent two-step processing within the T. brucei mitochondrion. In order to determine if an exposed surface component is required for import, the crude mitochondrial fraction was treated with proteinase K prior to incubation with the labeled ISP precursor. The activity of the protease was modulated by performing the pretreatment at either 4°C (mild digestion) or at 25°C (extensive digestion). As controls, crude mitochondria were also preincubated at these two temperatures in the absence of protease. The protein profiles of the 4°C (Fig. 3A, lane 1) and the 25°C (Fig. 3A, lane 2) controls are identical and are similar to the profile observed earlier without any preincubation (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Preincubation at 4°C in the absence of protease also did not affect the ability of the mitochondria to bind ISP (Fig. 3B, lane 1, −Prot. K) or to import and process ISP precursor to the intermediate and mature forms (Fig. 3B, lane 5, +Prot. K). However, preincubation at 25° C (Fig. 3B, lane 6, +Prot. K) did slightly reduce the overall imp"

https://openalex.org/W2077701369,"Shc has two distinct domains, amino-terminal and SH2 domain, which can interact with activated growth factor receptors. Shc interacts with insulin receptor via Shc-amino-terminal (N) domain, whereas Shc associates with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor through both Shc-N and -SH2 domains. In accordance with the different functional roles between insulin and EGF receptors, EGF stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc faster than insulin. To clarify the functional importance of three distinct Shc domains on insulin and EGF signaling, we microinjected glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the amino terminus plus collagen homology domain (NCH), collagen homology domain (CH), and Src homology 2 domain (SH2) into Rat1 fibroblasts expressing insulin receptors (HIRc). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation into newly synthesized DNA was subsequently studied to assess the importance of the three distinct domains of Shc. Microinjection of the NCH-GST fusion protein inhibited BrdUrd incorporation induced by both EGF and insulin, whereas microinjection of the SH2-GST fusion protein inhibited EGF, but not insulin stimulation of DNA synthesis. Neither EGF- nor insulin-induced BrdUrd incorporation was inhibited by the CH-GST fusion protein. Following EGF or insulin stimulation, Shc is phosphorylated on single Tyr-317 residue serving as a docking site for Grb2. Microinjection of Shc-N+CH GST fusion protein with Tyr-317 → Phe replacement (Y317F) also inhibited insulin stimulation of DNA synthesis. Next, we stably overexpressed wild-type Shc or Y317F mutant Shc into HIRc cells. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was compared among the transfected cell lines, since IRS-1 and Shc could competitively interact with insulin receptor. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was decreased in both WT-Shc and Y317F-Shc cells compared with that in HIRc cells. Furthermore, overexpression of the Shc-SH2 domain or Shc-N+CH domain with Y317F mutation interfered with EGF-stimulated endogenous Shc phosphorylation. These results suggest that the amino terminus domain of Shc is functionally important in insulin- and EGF-induced cell cycle progression and that the phosphorylation of Shc Tyr-317 residue is independent of Shc interaction with these receptors.

However, identification of the amino acid(s) of 2-5A synthetase directly interacting with ATP is crucial to the elucidation of the mechanism of the enzymatic conversion of ATP to 2′,5′-oligoadenylates by 2-5A synthetase. Recombinant human 40-kDa 2-5A synthetase has been expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity in milligram quantities. The azido photoprobe, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, has been used to identify the ATP binding domain of the recombinant human 40-kDa 2-5A synthetase. Specific covalent photoincorporation of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP into the 2-5A synthetase, tryptic digestion of the covalently 32P-labeled enzyme, isolation of the photolabeled phosphopeptide by metal (Al3+) chelate chromatography, and high pressure liquid chromatography identified a 32P-pentapeptide, which has been assigned to the ATP binding domain of 2-5A synthetase. The radioactive pentapeptide has the sequence D196FLKQ200 in which the photoprobe, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, chemically modified the amino acid lysine 199. The catalytic importance of Lys199 was further established by mutation of lysine 199 to arginine 199 and histidine 199 using site-directed mutagenesis. The K199R and K199H recombinant human 40-kDa 2-5A synthetase mutants bind 8-azido-ATP and the allosteric activator, poly(I)·poly(C) but are enzymatically inactive. These photoaffinity labeling and mutation data strongly suggest that lysine 199 is essential for the formation of a productive 2-5A synthetase-ATP-double-stranded RNA complex for the enzymatic conversion of ATP to 2-5A.

Specific covalent photoincorporation of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP into the 2-5A synthetase, tryptic digestion of the covalently 32P-labeled enzyme, isolation of the photolabeled phosphopeptide by metal (Al3+) chelate chromatography, and high pressure liquid chromatography identified a 32P-pentapeptide, which has been assigned to the ATP binding domain of 2-5A synthetase. The radioactive pentapeptide has the sequence D196FLKQ200 in which the photoprobe, 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, chemically modified the amino acid lysine 199. The catalytic importance of Lys199 was further established by mutation of lysine 199 to arginine 199 and histidine 199 using site-directed mutagenesis. The K199R and K199H recombinant human 40-kDa 2-5A synthetase mutants bind 8-azido-ATP and the allosteric activator, poly(I)·poly(C) but are enzymatically inactive. These photoaffinity labeling and mutation data strongly suggest that lysine 199 is essential for the formation of a productive 2-5A synthetase-ATP-double-stranded RNA complex for the enzymatic conversion of ATP to 2-5A."

The major initiation site was determined at T located 49 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site by primer extention with mRNA from HepG2 and Hep3B cells. There was no TATA sequence in this region. Transient transfection assay with 5′-deletion constructs showed that the transcription of this gene was regulated by positive and negative regulatory elements (PRE and NRE). The PRE (−34 to +2) was essential for the maximal transcription of this gene, and the NRE (−141 to −34) appeared to be responsible for the tissue-specific expression of the gene. The PRE contained the CCAAT sequence and a mutation from CCAAT to CTGAT resulted in a significant loss of the transcriptional activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that two different proteins bound to the PRE (MSP-PRE-binding protein-1 (MSP-PREB1) and 2). MSP-PREB1 and 2 were detected in various cell types, and the CCAAT sequence was involved in these bindings. These findings indicate that MSP-PREB1 and 2 are positive regulators. Further characterization also revealed that MSP-PREB2 was identical to CCAAT binding transcription factor, also known as NF-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2027519482,"Integration host factor (IHF) activates transcription from the ilvPG promoter by severely distorting the DNA helix in an upstream region of a supercoiled DNA template in a way that alters the structure of the DNA in the downstream promoter region and facilitates open complex formation. In this report, the in vivo and in vitro influence of DNA supercoiling on transcription from this promoter is examined. In the absence of IHF, promoter activity increases with increased DNA supercoiling. In the presence of IHF, the same increases in superhelical DNA densities result in larger increases in promoter activity until a maximal activation of 5-fold is obtained. However, the relative transcriptional activities of the promoter in the presence and absence of IHF at any given DNA superhelical density remains the same. Thus, IHF and increased DNA supercoiling activate transcription by different mechanisms. Also, IHF binds with equal affinities to its target site on linear and supercoiled DNA templates. Therefore, IHF binding does not activate transcription simply by increasing the local negative supercoiling of the DNA helix in the downstream promoter region or by differential binding to relaxed and supercoiled DNA templates.

Therefore, IHF binding does not activate transcription simply by increasing the local negative supercoiling of the DNA helix in the downstream promoter region or by differential binding to relaxed and supercoiled DNA templates. The chromosomal DNA of the bacterium Escherichia coli is highly compacted and negatively supercoiled (1Drlica K. Mol.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The supercoiled state of the E. coli chromosome is primarily maintained by the opposing activities of two topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I. DNA gyrase, composed of two subunits encoded by the gyrA and gyrB genes, introduces negative supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent manner; whereas, DNA topoisomerase I, the product of the topA gene, removes negative supercoils from DNA by an ATP-independent mechanism (1Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The supercoiled state of the chromosome is known to effect the activity of many promoters. The activity of some promoters is greatly diminished when DNA is relaxed, while the activity of others is unaffected or even enhanced (1Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The ilvGMEDA operon of E. coli is required for the biosynthesis of the branch chained amino acids, L-isoleucine and L-valine (4Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1987: 302Google Scholar). This operon is preceded by a strong σ70-promoter, ilvPG. Transcription from this promoter is activated by two upstream activating sequences, UAS1 and UAS2 (Fig. 1). UAS2 contains an “UP” element (5Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L.

IHF forms a higher-order protein-DNA complex in UAS1 that facilitates unwinding of the DNA helix in the −10 hexanucleotide region of the downstream ilvPG promoter, and this binding is accompanied by an increase in the rate of open-complex formation (7Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These and other observations (see “Discussion”) coupled with the observations that IHF-mediated activation occurs in the absence of specific protein interactions between IHF and RNA polymerase, and that IHF-mediated activation requires a negatively supercoiled DNA template, support the hypothesis that IHF activates transcription from this promoter by an allosteric DNA mechanism that is influenced by the superhelical state of the DNA template (7Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this report, we examine the effects of DNA supercoiling on IHF-mediated activation. We show that the activity of the ilvPG promoter increases with increased negative supercoiling and that this sensitivity to superhelical density is enhanced in the presence of IHF. We further show that IHF and DNA supercoiling influence transcription from this promoter by different mechanisms, and that activation is not the consequence of differential binding of IHF to relaxed and supercoiled DNA templates.

Cell growth was arrested by chilling the culture on ice. β-Galactosidase activities were assayed by measuring o-nitrophenyl β-D-galactoside hydrolysis in SDS-chloroform permealized cells. β-Galactosidase activities were measured at four different time points and two extract concentrations under conditions where the assay was linear with respect to time and extract concentration.

The binding affinity of IHF to its target site in the ilvPG promoter regulatory region was determined on a linear DNA template by gel mobility shift assays.

The radiolabeled DNA (1 × 10−11 M final concentration) was preincubated with purified IHF in a 20-µl assay mixture (40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mM MgCl2, 70 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 25 µg/ml herring sperm DNA). The free IHF concentration in each sample was assumed to be the same as the total IHF concentration since the DNA template concentration was significantly lower than that of the total protein concentration. The DNA fragments and IHF were incubated at 25°C for 20 min and the free and IHF-bound DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (4.83% acrylamide, 0.17% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (14Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Free and IHF-bound DNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography following the exposure of the dried gels to Kodak XAR-5 film at −70°C in the presence of a Cronex Quanta III intensifying screen (DuPont). Quantitation of band intensity on autoradiographic film was performed utilizing the public domain NIH IMAGE gel quantitation software (ftp://zippy.nimh.nih.gov). Determination of equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) was performed as described by Brenowitz et al. (17Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). According to this method the binding curve is described by the Langmuir isotherm, Y = k[P]/1+k[P]. The equilibrium binding data were analyzed by a non-linear least squares parameter estimation method. The algorithm for this analysis (18Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (511) Google Scholar) uses a variation of the Gauss-Newton procedure (19Hildebrand F.B. Introduction to Numerical Analysis. McGraw-Hill Publishing Corp., New York1956Google Scholar) to determine the best fit, model-dependent, parameter values corresponding to a minimum in the variance of each data point. The confidence levels for the curve fits reported correspond to approximately 1 standard deviation (65% confidence). In fitting the data to the equations, the substitution, ΔG = -RTln K, was made so that the ΔG values for each experiment were the actual curve fit parameters. Quantitative DNase I footprinting assays were performed to determine the binding affinity of IHF to its target site on a negatively supercoiled DNA template. Supercoiled plasmid DNA (1 × 10−11 M final concentration) was incubated for 20 min at 25°C with purified IHF in the same assay mixture used for the gel mobility shift assays. The IHF-DNA mixture was treated with 5 ng of DNase I for exactly 2 min to insure single-hit kinetic conditions (17Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 132-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). DNase I reactions were stopped by placing the samples in boiling water for 5 min. The sites of protection from DNase I cleavage were mapped by primer extension using Taq DNA polymerase and an ilv-specific oligonucleotide, OL-132 (40 pmol), that anneals to ilv bp positions −155 to −132 (16Lawther R.P.

Thirty cycles of primer extension were performed in a Perkin Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler Model 480 (1 min at 95°C (denaturing), 1 min at 55°C (reannealing), and 1 min at 72°C (extension)). The amplified primer extension products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.6% acrylamide, 0.4% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8 M urea in TBE buffer (90 mM Tris borate (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (14Ausubel F.

For quantitation, the band intensities in the protected region of each lane were normalized to the intensity of the band at bp −69. The equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by the methods of Brenowitz et al. (17Brenowitz M. Senear D.F. Shea M.A. Ackers G.K.

RNA polymerase-plasmid DNA complexes were formed by preincubating 0.5 units (1.2 pmol) of RNA polymerase and 250 ng of plasmid DNA (0.1 pmol) in a 45-µl reaction mixture (0.04 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M KCl, 0.01 M MgCl2, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 200 µM CTP, 20 µM UTP, 10 µCi (3,000 Ci/mmol) of [α-32P] UTP, 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 40 units of RNasin) for 10 min at 25°C. Transcription reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 µl of a 2 mM ATP, 2 mM GTP solution. Reactions were terminated after 3 and 6 min by removing a 15-µl sample and adding it to 15 µl of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol). The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.6% acrylamide, 0.4% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8 M urea in TBE buffer (14Ausubel F.

Each plasmid DNA sample was extracted three times with phenol to remove the ethidium bromide, precipitated with 2 volumes of isopropyl alcohol, and resuspended in 20 µl of water. The plasmid DNA topoisomers were resolved by electrophoresis on four, 1.4%, agarose gels in TAE buffer (14Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar) containing 0.006, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.08 µg/ml of ethidium bromide, respectively. The average linking number difference of the DNA plasmid in each sample (ΔLk) was determined by the band counting methods of Keller (21Keller W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4876-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) and Singleton and Wells (22Singleton C.K. Wells R.D. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The average superhelical density (σ) was calculated using the equation σ = −10.5ΔLk/N, where N is the number of bp in the plasmid (pDHΔwt contains 4203 bp). A set of DNA topoisomers of the plasmid pDHΔwt (Table I), which ranged in average linking number deficiencies (ΔLk) from 0 to −48, corresponding to negative superhelical densities of σ = −0.00 to −0.14, were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 2). The transcriptional activity of the ilvPG promoter on DNA templates with different superhelical densities was determined by measuring the rate of ilv specific transcript production in an in vitro transcription reaction (Fig. 3). The in vitro transcription reactions were performed with a minimally saturating concentration of RNA polymerase under conditions where the rate of transcript formation was directly proportional to the DNA template concentration (data not shown). Under these experimental conditions, the transcriptional activity of the ilvPG promoter is below detectable levels on a completely relaxed DNA template (σ = −0.00), is detectable at a superhelical DNA density of about σ = −0.01, increases in the physiological range of superhelical DNA densities from σ = −0.03 to −0.09, and reaches a maximal transcription rate at a superhelical DNA density of about σ = −0.09 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the transcriptional activity of the ilvPG promoter is intrinsically sensitive to the superhelical density of the DNA template.Fig. 3In vitro transcriptional analysis of ilvPG promoter activity in the absence and presence of IHF at various superhelical densities.Show full captionIn vitro transcriptions were performed in the presence (+IHF; 20 nM) or absence (−IHF) of IHF with plasmid DNA template, pDHΔwt, of various superhelical densities as described under “Materials and Methods.” Transcription reactions were terminated after 3 and 6 min and the 157-nucleotide ilvPG2 (referred to as ilvPG in this work) and 229 nucleotide ilvPG1 transcripts were isolated by electrophoresis on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea and visualized by autoradiography as described under “Materials and Methods.” The ilvPG1 transcripts arises from a fortuitous in vitro promoter in the A+T-rich UAS1 region (7Parekh B.S.

All measurements were obtained from autoradiogram exposures where the band intensities were linear with respect to time. The values presented are the mean ± S.D. of four separate experiments. When a nearly saturating concentration of IHF (20 nM) was included in in vitro transcription reactions, the effect of superhelical DNA density on the rate of transcription from the ilvPG promoter was similar to that observed in the absence of IHF. That is, the superhelical DNA density that produced half-maximal promoter activity in the presence of IHF was the same as the superhelical DNA density that produced half-maximal promoter activity in the absence of IHF (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). However, in the presence of IHF, increases in superhelical DNA densities resulted in larger increases in promoter activity until a maximal activation of 5-fold was obtained at a superhelical DNA density of σ = −0.09 (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). At higher superhelical DNA densities, no further activation was observed and at superhelical DNA densities below σ = −0.03 little, if any, IHF-mediated activation was apparent. These data suggest that IHF does not affect the overall response of the ilvPG promoter to changes in superhelical DNA density; rather, in the presence of IHF, promoter activity is more sensitive to small changes in the superhelical density of the DNA template in the physiological range of σ = −0.03 to −0.09. Furthermore, the observation that in the absence of IHF, transcriptional activity did not continue to increase beyond a superhelical DNA density of σ = −0.09 (Fig. 4) suggests that the activation role of IHF cannot be replaced simply by increasing the superhelical density of the DNA template. Thus, IHF and increased negative supercoiling activate transcription from the ilvPG promoter by different mechanisms.Fig. 6Effect of superhelical DNA density"

In a previous communication (Himawan, J., and Richardson, C. C. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 89, 9774-9778), we reported that an E. coli strain encoding a Gly-74 to Asp-74 (G74D) thioredoxin mutation could not support wild-type T7 growth and that in vivo, six mutations in T7 gene 5 could individually suppress this G74D thioredoxin defect. In the present study, we report the purification and biochemical characterization of the G74D thioredoxin mutant and two suppressor gene 5 proteins, a Glu-319 to Lys-319 (E319K) mutant of gene 5 protein and an Ala-45 to Thr-45 (A45T) mutant. The suppressor E319K mutation, positioned within the DNA polymerization domain of gene 5 protein, appears to suppress the parental thioredoxin mutation by compensating for the binding defect that was caused by the G74D alteration. We suggest that the Glu-319 residue of T7 gene 5 protein and the Gly-74 residue of E. coli thioredoxin define a contact point or site of interaction between the two proteins. In contrast, the A45T mutation in gene 5 protein, located within the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain, does not suppress the G74D thioredoxin mutation by simple restoration of binding affinity. Based upon our understanding of the mechanisms of suppression, we propose a model for the T7 gene 5 protein-E. coli thioredoxin interaction.

Based upon our understanding of the mechanisms of suppression, we propose a model for the T7 gene 5 protein-E. coli thioredoxin interaction. The concept of using genetic or suppressor analysis to investigate protein-protein interaction can be described as follows. If two proteins form a complex, then there must exist a contact point, or more likely, several contact points between them. These contact points would be defined by certain amino acid residues of one protein that must be physically adjacent to certain amino acid residues of the other protein. If a contact point amino acid from one protein is structurally altered significantly by mutation, then complex formation with the second protein would be destroyed. Theoretically, a productive complex could be formed once again by an alteration in the second protein that structurally compensates for the original mutation. Therefore, by mutating one protein of a complex and selecting for extragenic suppressor mutations in the second protein, one should be able to identify the contact points between the two proteins. We (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have used extragenic suppressor analysis to investigate the interactions between two proteins that are involved in DNA replication in Escherichia coli infected with bacteriophage T7. Similar to our studies, other workers have also used suppressor analysis to study protein-protein interactions in the E. coli DNA replication system (2Walker J.R. Ramsey J.A. Haldenwang W.G. Proc.

Thioredoxin also greatly stimulates the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of T7 gene 5 protein on double-stranded DNA (7Adler S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

We have focused our studies on the interactions between T7 gene 5 protein and thioredoxin in order to understand how thioredoxin confers processivity upon gene 5 protein. Unlike other more complex DNA replication systems, such as those of bacteriophage T4, E. coli, and eukaryotes (15O'Donnell M. Onrust R. Dean F.B. Chen M. Hurwitz J.

In this work, we have complemented our previous genetic analysis of the interaction between T7 gene 5 protein and E. coli thioredoxin (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with a biochemical analysis of the same interaction. We began our previous investigation by using E. coli thioredoxin mutants that were unable to support wild-type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WTwild typePCRpolymerase chain reaction. T7 growth to select for suppressor strains of phage T7 that contained a compensating mutation in gene 5. We found that an E. coli strain containing a glycine 74 to aspartate 74 substitution (G74D) in thioredoxin could not support the growth of WT T7 phage. Furthermore, we found that six different mutations in T7 gene 5 could individually suppress the G74D alteration in thioredoxin. Three of the six suppressor mutations (E319K, E319V, Y409C) were positioned within the putative DNA polymerization domain of T7 gene 5 protein, and the other three suppressor mutations (A45T, V3I, V32A) were positioned within the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease domain. In this paper, we have attempted to explain, at a biochemical level, the mechanism of suppression for two representative suppressor mutations (E319K and A45T). wild type polymerase chain reaction. E. coli JH20 (ΔtrxA307,pcnB80), E. coli HMS231 (trxA+,pcnB+), E. coli SB2111 (a strain harboring the plasmid pBR325trxA11), E. coli MV1190 (F′,supE), WT bacteriophage T7, phage T7trx5 (a T7 phage that has a WT thioredoxin gene inserted in its genome), phage T7-5-E319K, phage T7-5-A45T, bacteriophage P1vir, and plasmid pBR325trxA11 (a plasmid encoding a Gly-74 to Asp-74 thioredoxin mutant) were described previously (1Himawan J.S.

Plasmids pGP5-5-E319K and pGP5-5-A45T, both derivatives of pGP5-5, were constructed as described below. E. coli AN1 (ΔtrxA307,pcnB+) was constructed by using phage P1vir to transduce the ΔtrxA307 allele from JH20 into HMS231. The presence of the thioredoxin deletion (ΔtrxA307) within AN1 was verified by several methods. First, AN1 was unable to support the growth of WT T7 but was able to support the growth of T7trx5, indicating a defect in the thioredoxin gene. Second, amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the chromosomal DNA surrounding the thioredoxin gene showed the presence of a deletion of the appropriate size. Third, restriction enzyme analysis of the PCR-generated DNA fragment confirmed that the deletion was positioned correctly. E. coli AN1(pBR325trxA11), the strain used to purify the Gly-74 to Asp-74 thioredoxin (G74DTrxA), was constructed by purifying the plasmid pBR325trxA11 from E. coli SB2111 and by transforming pBR325trxA11 into E. coli AN1. Strain SB2111 was not used for the production of the G74DTrxA, because the pcnB− mutation within SB2111 reduces the intracellular copy number of plasmid pBR325trxA11 (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consequently, SB2111 produces less G74DTrxA than AN1(pBR325trxA11).

Following overnight growth, the cell culture was centrifuged to collect the cells, and the cells (wet weight of 10 g) were resuspended in ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.2, 20 mM EDTA, 10% sucrose. The solution of resuspended cells was frozen by treatment with liquid nitrogen, and the frozen cells were thawed by an overnight incubation at 0°C. This freeze-thaw procedure selectively releases thioredoxin from the cells (34Lunn C.A. Pigiet V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11424-11430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation to produce fraction I (freeze-thaw supernatant). Residual amounts of DNA were removed from fraction I (35 ml) by the addition of streptomycin sulfate (4% final concentration), allowing selective precipitation of the DNA by centrifugation to generate fraction II (streptomycin sulfate supernatant). Ammonium sulfate was added to fraction II (3.5 g/35 ml) to precipitate proteins, generating fraction III (ammonium sulfate supernatant). Fraction III (35 ml) was dialyzed against 2 liters of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) and was applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column (4.9 cm2× 8 cm) that was equilibrated with buffer A. Bound G74D thioredoxin was eluted by a 250-ml continuous gradient of NaCl (25 mM to 500 mM) in buffer A. The fractions containing thioredoxin were pooled (70 ml), concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation (33 g/70 ml), and dissolved in 1 ml of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (buffer B) to generate fraction IV. Fraction IV (1 ml) was subjected to gel filtration through a Sephadex G-50 column (1.8 cm2× 50 cm) that was equilibrated in buffer B, and fractions that contained thioredoxin were pooled (5 ml) to generate fraction V. Using the fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system from Pharmacia, fraction V (5 ml in buffer B) was loaded unto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (1-ml bed volume) that was equilibrated in buffer B. Thioredoxin bound to the Mono Q matrix and was eluted by a continuous gradient of NaCl (10-300 mM) in buffer B. Under these conditions, thioredoxin (fraction VI) eluted at 85 mM NaCl, and the G74D thioredoxin was greater than 95% pure, as estimated by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining (data not shown). During purification of WT thioredoxin, the presence of the protein can be detected quantitatively by its ability to reduce certain substrates (35Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or by its ability to stimulate the DNA polymerase activity of T7 gene 5 protein (T7 DNA polymerase) (6Hori K. Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11591-11597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the G74D mutant thioredoxin had negligible reduction activity (19Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could stimulate T7 DNA polymerase only at relatively high (10 µM) concentrations (36Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, during the purification process, the presence of the G74D thioredoxin was detected by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A purification table was constructed retrospectively by using the purified G74D thioredoxin (fraction VI) to estimate the amount of mutant thioredoxin that was present in the earlier fractions. In summary, we estimate that fraction I contained 350 mg of total protein with 1170 units of activity (specific activity of 3 units/mg), and fraction VI contained 3 mg of protein with 180 units of activity (specific activity of 60 units/mg), resulting in approximately a 15% total yield and a 20-fold purification. One unit of thioredoxin activity was defined arbitrarily as the amount of thioredoxin required to stimulate the T7 DNA polymerase-mediated incorporation of 10 nmol of deoxynucleotides into DNA in a standard DNA polymerase assay containing 5 nM of WT T7 DNA polymerase. DNA from the mutant T7 phage strain T7-5-E319K, a T7 phage encoding a glutamate to lysine substitution at amino acid residue 319 of its gene 5 protein (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was purified. The purified T7-5-E319K DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes SapI and PshAI, and the resulting 11 DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis through an agarose gel. The DNA fragment that contained the E319K mutation (E319K mutant fragment) was purified. Similarly, the plasmid pGP5-5 was incubated with the same two restriction enzymes to generate two DNA fragments, and the DNA segment (vector fragment) that did not contain the Glu-319 residue was purified. This vector fragment was incubated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and the dephosphorylated vector fragment, unable to self-ligate, was covalently attached to the E319K mutant fragment by incubation with T4 DNA ligase, generating the plasmid pGP5-5-E319K. The presence of the E319K mutation, a guanine to adenine transition (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) at base number 15,307 of the T7 DNA sequence (37Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), within pGP5-5-E319K was verified by DNA sequencing (data not shown). The DNA sequence surrounding the cloning junctions was also determined and revealed no other mutations. Plasmid pGP5-5-E319K was transformed into E. coli A307, ompT and the mutant E319K gene 5 protein (E319Kg5P) was purified from this strain. E. coli A307, ompT− had three characteristics that made it particularly suitable as a source for the purification of T7 gene 5 protein. First, its thioredoxin gene was deleted (19Russel M. Model P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to enable the purification of gene 5 protein alone, unbound to thioredoxin (12Modrich P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5515-5522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, this strain harbored a mutation in the OmpT endoprotease, which proteolytically cleaves T7 RNA polymerase during purification (38Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Recent work suggested that the OmpT protease may also cleave the WT T7 gene 5 protein (39Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15330-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during purification. 2S. Tabor, personal communication. Third, this strain was a HfrC strain and was sensitive to phage M13 infection. This third trait was required, because the overexpression of the E319K gene 5 was induced by infection with phage M13mGP1-2 in the presence of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 1.14.1-1.15.5Google Scholar). The E319Kg5P was purified from E. coli A307, ompT(pGP5-5-E319K) using a method that deviated slightly from a previously described procedure (8Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteriophage M13mGP1-2 was propagated by infecting E. coli MV1190 and was purified as described (24Yamamoto K.R. Alberts B.M. Benzinger R. Lawhorne L. Treiber G. Virology. 1970; 40: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Five liters of E. coli A307, ompT(pGP5-5-E319K) cells were grown with vigorous aeration and stirring (350 rpm) in a Magnaferm fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc.) in rich media (2% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, 0.2% dextrose, 0.2% casamino acids, 10 mM NaOH, 20 mM KPO4, pH 7.4) at 37°C. At a cellular concentration of approximately 109 cells/ml (A590 = 4), aeration was reduced, and the speed of the stirring drive was lowered to 100 rpm. These alterations in culture conditions were necessary to allow the cells to generate pili, required for M13 attachment. After 30 min of cell growth in conditions of low aeration and stirring, the temperature of the culture was lowered to 34°C, and the overexpression of E319Kg5P was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside and M13mGP1-2 at a multiplicity of infection of 50. After another 30 min to allow for phage adsorption and penetration, the amount of aeration and stirring was returned to initial levels. The cells were harvested (35 g wet weight) 2.5 h later as described (8Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the mutant E319Kg5P was as described previously (8Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the last purification step (hydroxyapatite chromatography) was omitted. The purification of the E319K gene 5 protein is summarized in Table I. The mutant E319K gene 5 protein was purified approximately 50-fold from the crude extract with a 4% total yield. Fraction V was greater than 90% pure, as estimated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by silver staining.TABLE IPurification of the E319K and the A45T mutant gene 5 proteins from E. coli A307, ompT(pGP5-5-E319K) and A307, ompT(pGP5-5-A45T) cells, respectively The amount of protein and the units of DNA polymerase activity were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fraction and stepProteinUnitsSpecific activityRecoverymg×103units/mg%Purification of the E319K gene 5 proteinI.

DNA from the mutant T7-5-A45T, a T7 phage harboring an alanine to threonine substitution at amino acid residue 45 of its gene 5 protein (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was purified. The T7-5-A45T DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme SnaBI to generate 14 DNA segments, which were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The DNA fragment encoding the A45T mutation was purified (A45T mutant fragment). Plasmid pGP5-5 DNA was also digested with SnaBI to generate two segments, and the DNA fragment that did not contain the Ala-45 residue (vector fragment) was purified. This vector fragment and the A45T mutant fragment were joined by incubation with T4 DNA ligase, producing plasmid pGP5-5-A45T. The A45T mutation, a guanine to adenine transition at base number 14,485 of the T7 DNA sequence (1Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9774-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was located within the recognition site (5′-GCGC-3′) of the restriction enzyme HhaI (the altered base is underlined). This made it possible to verify the presence of the A45T mutation within pGP5-5-A45T by simply detecting the appropriate HhaI restriction fragment length polymorphism. Additionally, restriction enzyme analysis was used to verify that the A45T fragment was inserted into the vector fragment in the correct orientation and to verify that the cloning procedure did not generate unwanted mutations at the ligation junctions. Plasmid pGP5-5-A45T was then transformed into E. coli A307, ompT to generate the strain E. coli A307, ompT(pGP5-5-A45T), and the A45T gene 5 protein was purified from this strain. The expression and purification of the mutant A45Tg5P were performed by the same procedure described for the E319Kg5P. A 2-liter culture of E. coli A307"

https://openalex.org/W2159223801,"The biological consequences of O6-methylguanine (m6G) in DNA are well recognized.

DNA polymerases are predicted to encounter m6G in three DNA environments: 1) in single- or short nucleotide gaps formed during short patch DNA repair, 2) in lengthy single-stranded regions formed by long patch repair, and 3) at replication forks. Single-nucleotide gaps may be produced by short patch mismatch repair activity that is normally directed to the repair of G:T mispairs that are the result of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) deamination (4Wiebauer K. Jiricny J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5842-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The enzyme that initiates this repair process is a DNA G:T mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase that removes the mispaired thymine from G:T DNA to generate an apyrimidinic site (5Neddermann P. Jiricny J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21218-21224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A G:T thymine-DNA glycosylase also initiates the removal of thymine from m6G:T base pairs (6Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7998-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The abasic site is further processed to generate a single-nucleotide gap across from guanine for G:T mismatches and across from m6G for m6G:T mismatches. While pol β can efficiently fill in single-nucleotide and small gaps across from undamaged DNA templates (7Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pol β activity on single-nucleotide gaps across from m6G has not been reported. Pol β replication is blocked, however, by template m6G in long single-stranded DNA templates (8Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B. Widen S.T. Notario V. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Long patch mismatch repair also appears to act on m6G:T base pairs. The model proposed by Karran and Marinus (9Karran P. Marinus M.G. Nature. 1982; 296: 868-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), Scudiero et al. (10Scudiero D.A. Meyer S.A. Clatterbuck B.E. Mattern M. Ziolkowski C.H.J. Day III, R.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) is that mismatch repair enzymes recognize m6G base pairs in DNA as mismatches and produce long excision tracks in the non-m6G strand. Replication of the single-stranded region can result in incorporation of dTMP across from m6G to again produce the m6G:T base pair. Several studies demonstrate that m6G templates the preferential incorporation of dTMP in vivo (11Coulondre C. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 117: 577-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 12Loechler E.L. Green C.L. Essigmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1984; 259: 8095-8100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Singer B. Chavez F. Goodman M.F. Essigmann J.M. Dosanjh M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The resulting m6G:T mispair is again recognized by long patch repair enzymes, and the process of excision followed by replication is repeated. These futile cycles of excision and resynthesis are predicted to produce persistent discontinuities in the DNA that are thought to contribute to the cytotoxic effects of m6G in DNA. This model is supported by the observation that at least some cell lines that lack methyltransferase, but are tolerant to MNNG, also lack long patch mismatch repair (17Branch P. Aquillina G. Bignami M. Karran P. Nature. 1993; 362: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18Kat A. Thilly W.G. Fang W.-H. Longley M.J. Li G.-M. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6424-6428Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). In addition to replication associated with the repair of m6G-containing DNA, tolerant cells must be able to replicate chromosomes in preparation for cell division. Although several DNA polymerases have been shown to have some bypass activity, trans-lesion replication is poor (14Snow E.T. Foote R.S. Mitra S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8095-8100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In view of these numerous reports that demonstrate that m6G in DNA inhibits replication by many DNA polymerases but that m6G-containing DNA is replicated, nevertheless, in tolerant cells, experiments were designed to measure the ability of repair and replicative DNA polymerases to replicate m6G-containing DNA. The two DNA polymerases studied were 1) a mammalian repair DNA polymerase, pol β, and 2) a replicative DNA polymerase, bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase with its accessory protein, the product of gene 45 (gp45) which clamps the DNA polymerase to the DNA template. The T4 DNA polymerase-gp45 complex is functionally analogous to the human pol δ-PCNA complex (19Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although replication of m6G-containing substrates by several DNA polymerases including pol β and the T4 DNA polymerase have been examined previously, studies presented here attempted to approximate in vivo conditions more closely. Thus, while pol β was reported to have no trans-lesion replication activity on a single-stranded m6G-containing DNA template (8Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B. Widen S.T. Notario V. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we observed pol β m6G trans-lesion activity on short gapped templates, the optimal substrates for pol β replication activity (7Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, T4 DNA polymerase trans-lesion replication was dependent upon association with the gp45 accessory protein and on DNA templates that resemble DNA replication forks or long, single-stranded repair tracks. In addition to the highly purified recombinant pol β and T4 DNA polymerases, preparations of pol β from m6G-sensitive and m6G-tolerant cell lines were tested on the m6G-containing substrates in order to determine if tolerant cells encoded a mutant pol β with increased ability to replicate m6G-containing DNA. Mutant T4 DNA polymerases with reduced 3′→ 5′-exonuclease activity or increased intrinsic processivity were also examined for trans-lesion replication. Recombinant rat pol β was provided by S. Wilson and purified as described (20Kumar A. Widen S.G. Williams K.R. Keder P. Karpel R.L. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2124-2131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human pol β was partially purified from human glioma cell lines A1235 and A1235MR4 (1Day III, R.S. Ziolkowski C.H.J. Scudiero D.A. Meyer S.A. Lubiniecki A.H.J. Girardi A.J. Galloway S.M. Bynum G.D.

Both A1235 cell lines lack O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity, but the A1235MR4 cells are tolerant to the cytotoxic effects of m6G in DNA, whereas the A1235 cells are hypersensitive. Extracts from 10 confluent 100-mm tissue culture plates were prepared as described (22Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 23Sibghat-Ullah Husain I. Carlton W. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4471-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The extracts were chromatographed on a Mono Q HR5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and a salt gradient from 25 to 500 mM NaCl. Fractions eluting at 240 mM NaCl contained DNA pol β activity as determined by several criteria: high activity on short gapped DNA substrates, but low activity on primed single-stranded DNA templates; and inhibition by dideoxy-NTPs, but resistance to aphidicolin. A second set of fractions containing DNA polymerase activity eluted at a higher salt concentration (>0.4 M NaCl). This polymerase activity was different from pol β activity in the following ways: high activity on long, single-stranded DNA templates compared to short gapped DNA substrates, inhibition by ddNTPs, and sensitivity to aphidicolin. These properties are characteristic of eukaryotic replicative DNA polymerase, pol α, δ, and ϵ. The fractions containing apparent pol β activity were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The dialyzed fractions were stored at −80°C. This partially purified pol β fraction was used in the assays described below. Purification and characterization of wild type and mutant recombinant bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerases have been described (24Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. Stocki S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 60-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27100-27108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The T4 DNA polymerase accessory protein, the gene 45 protein (gp45), was purified from the expression vector constructed by Lin et al. (27Lin T.-C. Rush J.R. Spicer E.K. Konigsberg W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7000-7004Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and purified by a modification of the procedure described by Morris et al. (28Morris C.F. Hama-Inaba H. Mace D. Sinha N.K. Alberta B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6787-6796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A crude extract was prepared, and the extract was applied to a 75-ml, 5-cm diameter Q-Sepharose column. The gp45 bound to the column, and fractions containing gp45 eluted at 210 mM NaCl from a gradient of 50-500 mM NaCl in Ao buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). These fractions were pooled and further purified by chromatography through a 55-ml hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad, HTP) 5-cm diameter column in buffer containing 50-200 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM β mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. Fractions containing gp45 eluted at 135 mM potassium phosphate. The single major contaminating band was then removed by chromatography on a 1-ml Mono-Q column (Pharmacia) with a 20-ml linear gradient of 50-350 mM NaCl in Ao buffer. The gp45 eluted at 200 mM NaCl as an apparently homogeneous protein. Gapped and single-stranded DNA templates were made using combinations of synthetic oligonucleotides (Fig. 1). The 45-mer template strand had either a G or m6G residue as indicated. A three-nucleotide gapped substrate was formed by annealing a 24-mer that was complementary to the template DNA sequence upstream from the m6G residue plus an 18-mer primer that was complementary to template sequence downstream from the m6G residue (Fig. 1, panel A). A single-nucleotide gapped substrate was prepared by annealing a 20-mer primer (Fig. 2, panel B) in place of the 18-mer oligonucleotide. A two-nucleotide gapped substrate that allowed measurement of incorporation across from m6G or G as well as extension was prepared by annealing the 20-mer primer upstream and a 23-mer downstream of the template m6G (Fig. 1 panel C). “Gaps” were flanked by a 3′-OH group for extension of the 18- or 20-mer primers and a 5′-phosphate (P) in the upstream 23- or 24-mers. Primer extension DNA templates did not have a downstream oligomer (Fig. 1B).Fig. 2DNA pol β activity on gapped and single-stranded DNA substrates. Pol β was incubated with the three-nucleotide gapped substrate, with template G or m6G (panel A) or with the single-stranded DNA substrate, with template G or m6G (panel B). As in Fig. 1, m6G is indicated by a * over the G residue. All four dNTPs, each at 100 µM, were present. Reactions were incubated for 15 s, and the products were resolved by gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The amount of gap-filling or primer extension was quantitated by densitometer scanning. The values for extension are relative to the amount of labeled DNA. Reactions without heparin are indicated by a minus sign, whereas reactions with heparin are indicated by the plus sign. Detailed reaction conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The DNAs used were prepared by automated DNA synthesis. The m6G-containing DNA was synthesized by the Regional DNA Synthesis Laboratory at the University of Calgary as described by Sibghat-Ullah and Day (6Sibghat-Ullah Day III, R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7998-8008Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Approximately 65-70% of the m6G-containing template could be replicated and templated the preferential incorporation of dTMP in the complementary strand; the remainder of this template was refractory as a DNA template in any of the in vitro replication assays. We inferred from these observations that 65-70% of the template was authentic m6G-containing DNA. The 18-nucleotide primer (Fig. 1, A and B) and the 20-nucleotide primer (Fig. 1, B and C) were labeled with 32P at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) and standard reaction conditions (29Maniatis T. Fritach E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). The labeled primers were annealed with the other oligonucleotides illustrated in Fig. 1 by combining equal concentrations of each oligonucleotide (45 nM) in 50 µl of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The mixtures were heated at 70°C for 5 min and gradually cooled in the water bath to room temperature over 2 h. DNA polymerase reactions were done in two steps. The first step was a 5-min preincubation at 37°C with all reaction components except for Mg2+. The final concentrations of reaction components were 16.7 mM (NH4)2SO4, 72 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 200 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 µM dNTPs, 1.5 mM DTT, 8.3% glycerol, 0.15 mM EDTA, 3.75 nM DNA substrate, and 6.25 nM T4 DNA polymerase. For reactions with gp45, the same reaction conditions were used with the addition of 7.5% polyethylene glycol (Carbowax PEG-8000, Fisher) and 8 µM gp45 monomer. The ratio of DNA substrate to DNA polymerase to gp45 hexamer was 0.6:1.0:213. The high concentrations of gp45 and polyethylene glycol allowed formation of the DNA polymerase-gp45 complex without the additional accessory proteins (30Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second step was to start the reactions by the addition of Mg2+, or Mg2+ and heparin, to give a final concentration of 6.7 mM MgCl2. Heparin, when added, was at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and was sufficient to trap all free DNA polymerase. The total reaction volume was 12 µl. The conditions for producing an effective heparin trap for T4 DNA polymerase were described previously (26Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5635-5643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated at 37°C for the indicated times. The reactions were stopped with an equal volume (12 µl) of gel loading solution (92% deionized formamide, bromphenol blue, and xylene cyanol blue markers in TBE (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 100 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA)) and placed on ice. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide gels with 8 M urea in TBE buffer using 45 watts constant power for 80 min. The 32P-labeled products were visualized by autoradiography with Kodak X-Omat AR film. Reaction products were quantitated by densitometry using a Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer. Several film exposures were used to keep the signal within the linear range of the film. Analysis of image data was done using the Molecular Analyst software program (version 1.4) provided by Bio-Rad. The rate constant was determined as the slope of the intensity versus time. DNA pol β reactions were also done in two steps. Reaction components, 35 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM DTT, 200 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 µM dNTPs, 6.3% glycerol, 3.75 nM DNA substrate, and 6.25 nM pol β, were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C. The reactions were then started with either Mg2+ or a mixture of Mg2+ and heparin at the same concentrations used for T4 DNA polymerase. The conditions for producing an effective heparin trap for pol β were found to be identical to the conditions used for the T4 DNA polymerase. Reactions products were processed as described for the T4 DNA polymerase reactions. The concentration of pol β activity in preparations from human glioma cells was determined by comparing activity with the homogeneously purified rat pol β and the nonmodified gapped DNA substrate. In studies of short patch repair of m6G-T base pairs, we observed efficient replication of single-nucleotide gaps across from template m6G by partially purified pol β from human glioma cell lines (discussed below). This result was unexpected from earlier reports of pol β activity on an m6G-containing single-stranded DNA substrate that demonstrated that pol β could not incorporate nucleotides across from m6G (8Abbotts J. SenGupta D.N. Zmudzka B. Widen S.T. Notario V. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These earlier studies, however, did not use what is now known to be the optimal DNA substrate for pol β activity, substrates with small gaps (7Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to verify that pol β can incorporate nucleotides across from m6G in gapped substrates but not on substrates with long single-stranded regions, a homogeneous preparation of recombinant rat pol β was tested with the DNA substrates shown in Fig. 1. One of the gapped substrates used was the three-nucleotide gapped substrate illustrated in Fig. 1, panel A. With no m6G in the template, 44% of the primer was fully extended in 15 s to the +3 position, and significant displacement synthesis was observed to the +4 position (Fig. 2, panel A, lane 1). Heparin was used to measure the processivity of pol β DNA replication. When pol β dissociates from the DNA template, the enzyme is effectively trapped by heparin. A burst of replication was observed in the presence of the heparin trap; 12% of the primer was fully extended without dissociation (Fig. 2, panel A, lane 2). When these experiments were repeated with the m6G-substrate (lanes 3 and 4), most of the primer extended terminated one nucleotide before the template m6G residue, with or without the heparin trap. Thus, the burst of processive DNA replication by pol β was limited primarily to a two-nucleotide extension in the presence of template m6G. Without the heparin trap, the enzyme could cycle back onto the +2 extended primer for repeated attempts at trans-lesion replication (Fig. 2, panel A, lane 3). Similar results were observed with single- and double-nucleotide gapped substrates (data presented below). For all short gapped substrates, with or without m6G, efficient replication by pol β required a 5′-terminal phosphate on the downstream oligomer (data not shown). Requirement for the downstream 5′-phosphate for optimal pol β activity was reported previously (7Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pol β activity was reduced considerably with single-stranded DNA templates (Fig. 1B). Reaction conditions were the same as those used for the gapped DNA substrates. With no m6G in the primer extension template, only 7% of the primer was extended (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Pol β replication on the single-stranded substrate was also dissociative as indicated by the “ladder” pattern of products (Fig. 2B, lane 1) and the absence of replication with the heparin trap (Fig. 2B, lane 2). With the m6G substrate (Fig. 2B, lane 3), 7% of the primer was again extended, but all of the products terminated one position before the template m6G residue. No trans-lesion replication was observed with the heparin trap (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Because pol β first converted the three-nucleotide gapped substrate into a single-nucleotide gapped substrate before replication of template m6G (Fig. 2A, lane 4), the specificity of nucleotide incorporation across from m6G was investigated with a preformed single-nucleotide gap positioned directly across from either G or m6G. This substrate was formed by annealing the 24-mer plus the 20-mer primer to the template 45-mer (Fig. 1). The reactions contained either 100 µM dCTP, 100 µM dTTP, or both nucleotides each at 100 µM. The rate of incorporation of dTMP was 20-fold higher for the m6G template than for the nonmodified G template that verifies the mutagenic mistemplating of m6G (Table I and Fig. 3). Incorporation of dCMP across from m6G was also detected, but the rate was 5-fold less than that of dTMP.TABLE I.Replication of m6G DNA substrates by DNA pol β Rates of nucleotide extension were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reactions were incubated for 15 s, 1, 10, and 20 min.

Open table in a new tab In the cell, however, both dCTP and dTTP as well as dATP and dGTP are present. The rate of nucleotide incorporation in reactions with both 100 µM dCTP and dTTP and the single-nucleotide gapped substrate was comparable with the rate of dTMP incorporation in reactions that contained only dTTP (Table I and Fig. 3). Whether dCMP or dTMP was incorporated can be determined by the mobility of the +1 product in DNA sequencing gels. The 3′-terminal nucleotide has a significant effect on mobility (31Bowling J.M. Bruner K.L. Cmarik J.L. Tibbets C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3089-3097Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The primer extended with dCMP has a greater mobility than the primer extended with dTMP (Fig. 3). In reactions with both 100 µM dCTP and dTTP, primarily the slower moving 3′-dTMP-terminated primer was detected (Fig. 3).

Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This effect represents a feedback inhibitory mechanism that limits further antibody secretion. To inhibit B cell proliferation, the suppressive antibody must bind specific antigen and bear an intact Fc domain (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIB1)-sIg co-crosslinking generates a dominant negative signal that prevents B cell proliferation (4Phillips N.E.

It has been proposed that blocking of antibody-mediated FcγRIIB1-sIg crosslinking by FcγRIIB1-binding rheumatoid factors may play an etiological role in autoimmune diseases by disrupting this inhibitory mechanism, thereby facilitating continuous autoantibody production (3Sinclair M.R.

PTK activation leads to, among other events, tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2; Refs. 15Hempel W.M. Schatzman R.C. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3021PubMed Google Scholar and 16Coggeshall K.M. McHugh J.C. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1985; 134: 101PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ransom J.T. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 66PubMed Google Scholar). B cells deficient in p72syk expression demonstrated an inability to undergo receptor-mediated PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation, IP3 formation, and calcium mobilization (19Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO. J. 1994; 13: 1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), suggesting that p72syk mediates its action via tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2.It is notable that the activation events blocked by FcγRIIB1-sIg co-crosslinking, i.e. production of IP3 and increased intracellular Ca2+, are directly or indirectly dependent on the prior activation of PLC and that PLC activation is dependent on prior activation of PTKs. This fact raises the possibility that the FcγRIIB1-derived negative signal may be due to the abrogation of sIg-mediated PTK activation and/or of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ2. Here, we examined these possibilities in murine ex vivo B cells by immunoprecipitation of the various PTKs or PLCγ2 and in vitro assays of their enzymatic activity or tyrosine phosphorylation status. The data indicated that, under stimulatory conditions using F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig, Syk and Lyn were activated and PLCγ2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated. Under inhibitory conditions of FcγRIIB1-sIg co-crosslinking, the kinase activity of Syk and Lyn were likewise activated; however, and in contrast to activating conditions, PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated. These findings are able to account for previous reports (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Choquet D. Partiseti M. Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Korn H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) of inhibition of PLC activation under FcγRIIB1-sIg co-crosslinking conditions and are discussed in the context of current knowledge of lymphocyte antigen receptor-mediated activation events.DISCUSSIONNegative signaling in B cells is important in the maintenance of immune regulation. Co-crosslinking sIg and FcγRIIB1 was proposed to represent a negative feedback mechanism by bridging sIg and FcγRIIB1 via surface-bound antigen or via anti-idiotype antibodies and thereby preventing continuous production of antibodies (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fc receptor function in B cells may therefore be important for immune regulation via antigen-antibody complexes by inhibiting B cell proliferation and maturation into antibody secreting cells. Furthermore, rheumatoid factor, an IgM anti-Ig Fc antibody, was been proposed to prevent normal negative signaling by binding the Fc portion of secreted Ig, thereby potentially playing an etiological role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Previous studies regarding the biochemical nature of the aborted activation process demonstrated transient formation of IP3 when B cells are treated under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), indicating a short-lived PLC activation. In contrast, B cells stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig showed a more sustained IP3 formation, as well as later changes in cell activation (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, cell cycle progression induced upon sIg crosslinking with F(ab′)2 anti-Ig antibodies may be at least in part the result of increased IP3 and intracellular calcium, two important intracellular second messengers (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Choquet D. Partiseti M. Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Korn H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lack of these intracellular mediators under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions likely contribute to the observed inhibitory effect. Recently, two reports (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed decreased calcium flux upon treating A20 cells, a murine B cell lymphoma, with intact Ig antibodies. Additional experiments indicated that negative signaling required an intact immunoreceptor tyrosine-based Inhibitory motif (ITIM) within FcγRIIB1; furthermore, phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the ITIM was necessary for negative signaling (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, defective activation of A20 under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions could not be accounted for by the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and Syk; both these activation events were induced by intact anti-Ig (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Our data indicated that the activating signal under co-crosslinking conditions is identical to that induced by sIg crosslinking alone, i.e. both Syk and Lyn are activated and the B cells display similar increases in a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We observed the induction of a ∼35-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein in cells stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig that appeared to be absent from cells stimulated with intact anti-Ig. The precise nature of this band is not clear; however, preliminary studies established that Ig-α is tyrosine-phosphorylated under both conditions of stimulation. We have not examined the status of Ig-β under either stimulation condition. However, despite the essentially equivalent activation of upstream PTKs and increased tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation appeared only transiently (Fig. 3) in samples stimulated under negative signaling conditions. This finding can account for the previous reports that IP3 production and Ca2+ influx are transient events under co-crosslinking conditions (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as account for the obstruction of cell cycle progression.Recently it has been shown that tyrosine 309 in the ITIM motif of FcγRIIB1 associates with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTP1C (25D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). PTP1C is an intracellular phosphotyrosine phosphatase with two tandem N-terminal SH2 domains (26Shen S.H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 27Matthews R.J. Bowne D.B. Flores E. Thomas M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 28Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Rosemberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Kit (29Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and the β chain of interleukin-3 receptor (30Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via interaction of their SH2 domains. In B cells, the association and activation of PTP1C with FcγRIIB1 was detected upon co-crosslinking sIg with FcγRIIB1 and was dependent on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 309 on the ITIM (25D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The decreased or abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 observed upon sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking and reported here can be accounted for by the phosphatase activity of PTP1C. We therefore propose that upon sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking, tyrosine 309 in the ITIM of FcγRIIB1 is phosphorylated and PTP1C binds to FcγRIIB1 via its SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosine 309. This binding induces activation of PTP1C phosphatase activity, as reported (25D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Activated PTP1C then selectively dephosphorylates PLCγ2, while tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Syk and Lyn activation are not affected. This model is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This effect represents a feedback inhibitory mechanism that limits further antibody secretion. To inhibit B cell proliferation, the suppressive antibody must bind specific antigen and bear an intact Fc domain (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that Fcγ receptor (FcγRIIB1)-sIg co-crosslinking generates a dominant negative signal that prevents B cell proliferation (4Phillips N.E.

It has been proposed that blocking of antibody-mediated FcγRIIB1-sIg crosslinking by FcγRIIB1-binding rheumatoid factors may play an etiological role in autoimmune diseases by disrupting this inhibitory mechanism, thereby facilitating continuous autoantibody production (3Sinclair M.R.

Such antibodies inhibit B cell proliferation (5Phillips N.E. Parker D.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 627PubMed Google Scholar, 6Klaus G.G.B. Harylowicz C.M. Holman M. Keeler K.D.

The molecular basis of the FcγRIIB1-mediated inhibition of PLC activation and the generation of the intracellular mediators diacylglycerol and IP3 are poorly understood.Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the Src family, namely, p56blk, p58lyn, and p59fyn (9Burkhardt A.L.

B cells deficient in p72syk expression demonstrated an inability to undergo receptor-mediated PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation, IP3 formation, and calcium mobilization (19Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A.

This fact raises the possibility that the FcγRIIB1-derived negative signal may be due to the abrogation of sIg-mediated PTK activation and/or of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ2. Here, we examined these possibilities in murine ex vivo B cells by immunoprecipitation of the various PTKs or PLCγ2 and in vitro assays of their enzymatic activity or tyrosine phosphorylation status. The data indicated that, under stimulatory conditions using F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig, Syk and Lyn were activated and PLCγ2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated. Under inhibitory conditions of FcγRIIB1-sIg co-crosslinking, the kinase activity of Syk and Lyn were likewise activated; however, and in contrast to activating conditions, PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation was abrogated.

DISCUSSIONNegative signaling in B cells is important in the maintenance of immune regulation. Co-crosslinking sIg and FcγRIIB1 was proposed to represent a negative feedback mechanism by bridging sIg and FcγRIIB1 via surface-bound antigen or via anti-idiotype antibodies and thereby preventing continuous production of antibodies (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fc receptor function in B cells may therefore be important for immune regulation via antigen-antibody complexes by inhibiting B cell proliferation and maturation into antibody secreting cells. Furthermore, rheumatoid factor, an IgM anti-Ig Fc antibody, was been proposed to prevent normal negative signaling by binding the Fc portion of secreted Ig, thereby potentially playing an etiological role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Previous studies regarding the biochemical nature of the aborted activation process demonstrated transient formation of IP3 when B cells are treated under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), indicating a short-lived PLC activation. In contrast, B cells stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig showed a more sustained IP3 formation, as well as later changes in cell activation (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, cell cycle progression induced upon sIg crosslinking with F(ab′)2 anti-Ig antibodies may be at least in part the result of increased IP3 and intracellular calcium, two important intracellular second messengers (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Choquet D. Partiseti M. Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Korn H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lack of these intracellular mediators under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions likely contribute to the observed inhibitory effect. Recently, two reports (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z.

Additional experiments indicated that negative signaling required an intact immunoreceptor tyrosine-based Inhibitory motif (ITIM) within FcγRIIB1; furthermore, phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the ITIM was necessary for negative signaling (23Muta T.

PTP1C is an intracellular phosphotyrosine phosphatase with two tandem N-terminal SH2 domains (26Shen S.H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chretien P.

A. 1992; 89: 1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Kit (29Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and the β chain of interleukin-3 receptor (30Yi T. Mui A.L. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via interaction of their SH2 domains. In B cells, the association and activation of PTP1C with FcγRIIB1 was detected upon co-crosslinking sIg with FcγRIIB1 and was dependent on the phosphorylation of tyrosine 309 on the ITIM (25D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The decreased or abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 observed upon sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking and reported here can be accounted for by the phosphatase activity of PTP1C. We therefore propose that upon sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking, tyrosine 309 in the ITIM of FcγRIIB1 is phosphorylated and PTP1C binds to FcγRIIB1 via its SH2 domain to phosphorylated tyrosine 309. This binding induces activation of PTP1C phosphatase activity, as reported (25D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Activated PTP1C then selectively dephosphorylates PLCγ2, while tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Syk and Lyn activation are not affected. This model is currently under investigation in our laboratory. Negative signaling in B cells is important in the maintenance of immune regulation. Co-crosslinking sIg and FcγRIIB1 was proposed to represent a negative feedback mechanism by bridging sIg and FcγRIIB1 via surface-bound antigen or via anti-idiotype antibodies and thereby preventing continuous production of antibodies (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Fc receptor function in B cells may therefore be important for immune regulation via antigen-antibody complexes by inhibiting B cell proliferation and maturation into antibody secreting cells. Furthermore, rheumatoid factor, an IgM anti-Ig Fc antibody, was been proposed to prevent normal negative signaling by binding the Fc portion of secreted Ig, thereby potentially playing an etiological role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (3Sinclair M.R. Panokaltsis A. Immunol. Today. 1987; 6: 76Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies regarding the biochemical nature of the aborted activation process demonstrated transient formation of IP3 when B cells are treated under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), indicating a short-lived PLC activation. In contrast, B cells stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig showed a more sustained IP3 formation, as well as later changes in cell activation (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, cell cycle progression induced upon sIg crosslinking with F(ab′)2 anti-Ig antibodies may be at least in part the result of increased IP3 and intracellular calcium, two important intracellular second messengers (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 8Choquet D. Partiseti M. Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Fridman W.H. Korn H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 355Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The lack of these intracellular mediators under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions likely contribute to the observed inhibitory effect. Recently, two reports (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed decreased calcium flux upon treating A20 cells, a murine B cell lymphoma, with intact Ig antibodies. Additional experiments indicated that negative signaling required an intact immunoreceptor tyrosine-based Inhibitory motif (ITIM) within FcγRIIB1; furthermore, phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within the ITIM was necessary for negative signaling (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, defective activation of A20 under sIg-FcγRIIB1 co-crosslinking conditions could not be accounted for by the decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and Syk; both these activation events were induced by intact anti-Ig (23Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 369: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicated that the activating signal under co-crosslinking conditions is identical to that induced by sIg crosslinking alone, i.e. both Syk and Lyn are activated and the B cells display similar increases in a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. We observed the induction of a ∼35-kDa phosphotyrosine-containing protein in cells stimulated with F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-Ig that appeared to be absent from cells stimulated with intact anti-Ig. The precise nature of this band is not clear; however, preliminary studies established that Ig-α is tyrosine-phosphorylated under both conditions of stimulation. We have not examined the status of Ig-β under either stimulation condition. However, despite the essentially equivalent activation of upstream PTKs and increased tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation appeared only transiently (Fig. 3) in samples stimulated under negative signaling conditions. This finding can account for the previous reports that IP3 production and Ca2+ influx are transient events under co-crosslinking conditions (7Bijsterbosch M.K. Klaus G.G.B. J. Exp.

AP7 binding is minimally influenced by the conformational state of this receptor, whereas PAC1.1 binds preferentially to the activated state of the receptor induced by platelet agonists. To study the molecular basis for this functional difference, we replaced the AP7 H3 loop (HPFYRGDGGN) with all or segments of the analogous sequence from PAC1.1 (RSPSYYRGDGAGP). AP7 Fd (VH domain + Cγ1 domain) segments containing these H3 loop sequences were expressed as active Fab molecules by coinfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cell lines with recombinant baculoviruses containing Fd and AP7 κ chain cDNA. Replacement of the entire AP7 H3 loop with that from PAC1.1 generated the mutant AP7.3 Fab molecule, which bound selectively to either activated, gel-filtered platelets or to purified αIIbβ3 in a manner identical to that of PAC1.1. Identical results were obtained when solely the sequences flanking the amino side of RGD within the respective H3 loops were exchanged. AP7.3 and PAC1.1 exhibited saturable but submaximal binding to activated gel-filtered platelets. Relative to AP7, the number of AP7.3 or PAC1.1 Fab molecules bound per platelet was 17% in the presence of 1 mM Ca2++ 1 mM Mg2+ or 40% in the presence of 10 µM Mn2+. The ratio of Fab molecules bound after versus before activation (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) was: for AP7.3, 9.8 ± 0.6; for PAC1.1, 8.8 ± 0.3; and for AP7, 1.4 ± 0.2. In addition, AP7 bound to the stably expressed integrin mutant αIIbβ3(S123A), whereas AP7.3 and PAC1 did not. Because AP7.3 behaves in every respect like PAC1.1, we conclude that the ability of RGD-based ligands to distinguish activated from resting conformations of the integrin αIIbβ3 can be regulated by limited amino acid sequences immediately adjacent to the RGD tripeptide. Furthermore, those Fab molecules that exhibit increased selectivity for the activated conformation of αIIbβ3 bind to a subpopulation of this integrin on platelets that is modulated by divalent cations.

Mammalian ribonucleotide reductase is composed of two dissimilar dimeric protein components, proteins R1 and R2, which are required to catalyze the direct reduction of ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides, a rate-limiting step in the synthesis and repair of DNA (1Wright J.A.

The present study was intended to define the unique TPA-responsive cis-element in the 3′-UTR that leads to alterations in R2 mRNA stability. Mouse BALB/c 3T3, 10T1/2, COS7, C1 and C2 fibrosarcoma, human HeLa S3, and cells transfected with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) R2 3′-UTR hybrid plasmids were routinely cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (19Blomanis R.

For determining CAT/R2 3′-UTR hybrid mRNA levels and the cis-element binding activity, exponentially growing cells were treated for different times with various concentrations of TPA (Sigma), okadaic acid (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Me2SO was used to dissolve TPA and OKA; control cells received medium containing 0.01% Me2SO alone. Cells were also treated with 10 µg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) to block transcription and were harvested as described previously (20Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. Biochem.

Cells transferred to Eppendorf tubes were briefly centrifuged for 1 min, resuspended in hypotonic buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mM EDTA), and lysed by repetitive cycles of freeze-thaw.

In brief, run-off RNA transcripts were produced by T7 polymerase activity (Boehringer Mannheim) from 1 µg of digested cDNA plasmids as described previously (21Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B.S.

However, 50 units of RNase T1 (Boehringer Mannheim) were added when the R2 3′-UTR was used (but not for binding reactions with the 3′-end-labeled oligoribonucleotides). In some assays cytoplasmic extracts were preincubated with compounds such as diamide and N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min before the addition of the riboprobe. RNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described above. Following the addition of heparin, samples were placed in microtiter wells placed on ice and UV-cross-linked for 10 min in a Stratalinker Chamber (Stratagene), at a 250-mJ energy level. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (21Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B.S. Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. Bunn H.F. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16594-16598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA-protein complexes may dissociate to some degree during electrophoresis, resulting in a diffuse banding pattern (23Clerch B.L. Massaro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2853-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from drug-treated and untreated mouse BALB/c 3T3 transfectants by a rapid method of RNA preparation (24Gough N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). For half-life measurements, the cells were treated with 10 µg/ml actinomycin D. RNA was isolated at different times and analyzed for CAT and CAT/R2 3′-UTR hybrid transcripts. Twenty µg of total cellular RNA was electrophoresed through 1% formamide-agarose gels and blotted onto Nytran nylon membranes. The blots were prehybridized and probed with the 32P-labeled HindIII-BanI fragment of CAT cDNA, derived from the plasmid pSVlacOCAT (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of sample loading was performed by probing with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (5Hurta R.A.R. Samuel S.K. Greenberg A.H. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24097-24100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mRNA half-life was estimated as described previously (7Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4803-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4796-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCAT and the pCAT/R2 3′-UTR hybrid construct were similarly derived as described previously (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the notable exception that in this study the expression vector pECE polyadenylation signal fragment (25Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth E.A. Rutter N.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) was not deleted. This confers an increased half-life upon the pCAT transcript. Transfection of mouse BALB/c 3T3 cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar), using the plasmid pSV2neo as a selectable marker. Northern blot analysis (7Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4803-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4796-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and CAT assays (27Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) were performed to screen for permanently transfected cell lines. The PCR (40 cycles) was performed in a 100-µl total volume, and the reacting mixtures contained 50 ng of DNA template, 40 pmol of DNA primers, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The samples were gel-purified and subsequently digested with the restriction endonucleases, SalI/XbaI. Digests were heat-inactivated at 65°C for 15 min and ligated into the pCAT plasmid to generate pCAT/R2 normal and pCAT/R2 mutant. The nucleotide sequence of these fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sequenase). The wild-type DNA fragment (R2 normal) containing 154 base pairs of the 3′-UTR of R2 mRNA (nt positions 1224-1378), with the putative R2 binding protein complex (R2BP) cis-element, was generated by PCR with the plasmid pCD10 (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), harboring the R2 cDNA and the overlap extension primers, 5′-ACACACGTCGACGCTGACTTCTAAGTAACTC-3′ and 5′-CGACACATCGATGCAGTCAGCACAGATCTACACAC-3′. Similarly, oligonucleotides, 5′-ACACACGTCGACGCTGACTTCTAAGTAACTGATCATATACTCTTCG-3′ and 5′-CGACACATCGATGGAGTCAGGACAGATCTACACAC-3′ were used as primers to generate the 154-base pair DNA fragment of the R2 3′-UTR containing the mutated cis-element (R2 mutant). The underlined sequences shown above represent the SalI and XbaI linker sequences. To locate the binding site sequence within the 20-nt (FokI-HgiA) fragment of the 3′-UTR of R2 mRNA that forms the 45-kDa R2BP, we generated a series of synthetic oligoribonucleotides corresponding to different segments of the 20 nt. These RNA fragments were 3′-end-labeled and used in standard gel shift assays. The data summarized in Fig. 1, indicate that the 20-nt fragment forms similar RNA-protein complex shifts as the full-length 3′-UTR of R2 mRNA (Fig. 1C). The RNA fragment, 5′-UCGUGUGCU-3′, is identified as the only binding site within the 20-nt fragment, shown by the formation of the RNA-protein complex, when the corresponding riboprobe was incubated with cytoplasmic extracts from BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 1D, lane 6). This putative cis-element appears to be unique, since it does not resemble any known, previously described RNA cis-element, such as the AU-rich pentamer (11Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the iron response element (28Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), the amyloid precursor protein mRNA 29-nt stability element (13Zaidi S.H.E. Denman R. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24000-24006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the ribonucleotide reductase R1 mRNA cis-element (10Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4796-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, to determine the minimal cis-element sequence, formation of the R2BP was not observed for shorter oligoriboprobes under the same conditions that lead to binding activity with the entire 9-nt cis-element (Fig. 1E). Although it is possible that under other experimental conditions, such as higher RNA concentrations, these partial sequences may exhibit some binding activity, these results do suggest that the entire 9-nt sequence is optimal for binding. To determine if the binding factor was a protein, cytosolic extract from mouse BALB/c 3T3 cells was incubated with the 3′-end-labeled putative cis-element fragment in the presence of proteinase K (40 units/ml). This completely abolished R2BP formation (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The cis-element binding activity was not detected in nuclear extracts but was observed in cytosolic extracts (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that the complex detected in these experiments is composed of RNA and polypeptides and that the mechanism involved in the regulation of R2 mRNA stability is likely a postnuclear event. Using the 20-nt and full-length R2 3′-UTR RNA transcript as specific competitors in gel shift assays with the cis-element sequence as a riboprobe led to inhibition of the formation of the R2BP (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). The addition of 100 M excess of the human c-myc mRNA 3′-UTR fragment (12Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) did not prevent the RNA-protein complex formation (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Since the c-myc mRNA 3′-UTR used in this experiment contains four copies of the AU-rich cis-element (11Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), this result demonstrates the sequence-specific binding of protein(s) to the cis-element. RNA gel shift assays were performed with 30 µg of cytosolic protein extract from BALB/c 3T3 cells, 10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts, C1 and C2 mouse fibrosarcoma cells derived from 10T1/2 cells following T24-H-ras transfection (29Egan S.E. McClarty G.A. Jarolim L. Wright J.A. Spiro I. Hager G. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 830-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), human HeLa S3 cells, or COS7 monkey kidney fibroblasts. Fig. 2C shows that regardless of the origin and species of cells, the cis-element formed similar patterns of RNA-protein complex band shifts. This suggests that we have identified a widely distributed cellular protein(s) capable of interacting with the R2 3′-UTR cis-element. There are precedents in the literature for redox-sensitive binding of protein to nucleic acid (23Clerch B.L. Massaro D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2853-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that there were similar interactions with the R2 9-nt cis-element. We carried out a study of the effects of various reducing and oxidizing agents on the formation of R2BP in standard gel shift assays. Incubation of mouse BALB/c 3T3 cell extract with increasing concentrations of the reductant dithiothreitol significantly altered the cis-element binding activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 2-4). When 2-mercaptoethanol was added in increasing amounts, the intensity of the bands further increased (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). These observations suggest that BALB/c 3T3 cell extract had some ribonucleotide reductase R2 RNA-binding protein in the oxidized form that could be reduced to achieve greater RNA binding. However, this binding activity was abolished with the preincubation of the cell extract with N-ethylmaleimide (which alkylates and thus blocks free sulfhydryl groups). Treatment of the cell extract with increasing concentrations of diamide (which catalyzes the oxidation of free sulfhydryls) inhibits formation of the cis-element-protein complex. This inhibition by diamide was dose-dependent (Fig. 3B, lanes 2-4). However, inhibition produced by 100 mM diamide was slightly reversed by 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, whereas the binding activity was completely restored by 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, after preincubation of cytosolic extract with 50 mM diamide (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6). We noted that computer-generated analysis of a 77-nt base sequence (nt positions 1225-1302) of the R2 3′-UTR mRNA containing the 9-nt cis-element predicts one possible structure (Fig. 4B). The binding site is along one shaft of a stem-loop in the secondary structure. The effects of various mutations in the 9-nt 5′-UCGUGUGCU-3′ cis-element protein binding site were assessed by monitoring the formation of the R2BP in standard gel shift assays. Mutations within the cis-element of mouse R2 3′-UTR mRNA (bases 1245-1253) (30Amara F.M. Hurta R.A.R. Huang A. Wright J.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4503-4506PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that certain disruptions completely prevented R2BP formation (Fig. 4C). For example, mutation of any one of the core U residues to an A residue completely abolished binding activity, but mutation of the flanking U residues to A, G, or C residues did not prevent binding activity. In addition, mutations of C residues to G residues and vice versa within this motif abolished binding activity (Fig. 4C). These results are consistent with UV cross-linking data. For example, results from UV cross-linking analyses showed that the 9-nt cis-element (5′-UCGUGUGCU-3′) formed a 45-kDa R2BP (Fig. 4D) but not the mutant fragment, 5′-UCGAGAGCU-3′ (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, to examine cytosolic protein loading, a 3′-end-labeled human GM-CSF 3′-UTR (20-nt) fragment (12Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was added to the binding reaction mixtures. The results from the cross-linking analyses showed that RNA-protein complexes with migration bands of 30 and 35 kDa were cross-linked to the GM-CSF 3′-UTR, as previously reported (12Bohjanen P.R. Petryniak B. June C.H. Thompson C.B. Lindsten T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and that the loading in the various lanes appeared to be approximately equal, as determined by densitometry (Fig. 4D). To assess directly the functional role of the R2BP in the degradation of R2 mRNA, a 154-base pair R2 DNA PCR fragment (nt positions 1224-1378) carrying the wild-type cis-element (R2/N) or a mutant fragment (R2/M) containing a series of G → A mutations within the binding site that eliminates binding (Fig. 5, A and B), were inserted next to the CAT coding gene (Fig. 5C). Plasmid DNAs carrying these hybrid genes (CAT/R2N, CAT/R2M), and pCAT were transfected into mouse BALB/c 3T3 cells. These transfectants were exponentially grown, followed by the addition of actinomycin D (10 µg/ml) to inhibit transcription. The half-lives of the corresponding transcripts were determined as we have previously described (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4796-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The results showed that the CAT hybrid mRNA containing the normal cis-element binding site exhibited a half-life markedly shorter than that of the mRNA with the mutated insert. For example, the half-life of CAT/R2M was increased about 3-fold relative to CAT/R2N (Fig. 5C). The half-life of CAT/R2N mRNA was 1.6 h compared with that of CAT/R2M mRNA of 4.9 h. As expected, there was no significant difference between the half-life of the CAT transcript (5.3 h) and CAT/R2M (4.9 h) (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrated an inverse relationship between R2BP formation and in vivo message stability. TPA treatment decreases the binding activity of the R2BP (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since TPA is a potent stimulator of protein kinase C and a tumor promoter (31Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schönthal A. Tsukitani Y. Feramusco J.R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that a phosphorylation pathway is critically involved in mediating the TPA effects on the R2 3′-UTR mRNA binding activity. Cells were treated for various times with TPA or okadaic acid, whereas the control experiments included the treatment of cells with Me2SO. Unlike phorbol ester tumor promoters, which activate protein kinase C, okadaic acid specifically inhibits the phosphoserine/phosphothreonine protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (32Schönthal A. Tsukitani Y. Feramusco J.R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). The gel shift experiments showed that TPA treatment dramatically decreased the cis-element binding activity with time (Fig. 6A), in agreement with previous studies (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar to the TPA effect, okadaic acid treatment also significantly decreased the binding activity (Fig. 6B). Moreover, in the control experiments, Me2SO had no effect on the RNA-binding activity (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that a relationship exists between the increase in cellular protein phosphorylation in vivo and the R2 cis-element binding activity. If TPA and okadaic acid altered RNA-protein binding activity and message stability properties, presumably through a phosphorylation signal pathway, then their effects should be concentration-dependent. Fig. 6, D and E, shows that this is the case. For example, increasing the concentration of TPA and okadaic acid led to corresponding reductions in the 9-nt cis-element binding activity. On the other hand, increasing the concentration of Me2SO to as high as 50 µM did not affect protein binding to the cis-element (Fig. 6F). We have previously shown that the 3′-UTR is implicated in the destabilization of R2 mRNA and contains TPA-responsive elements that may be associated with R2 message stabilization (8Amara F.M. Chen F.Y. Wright J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6709-6715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a putative novel 9-nt cis-element, 5-UCGUGUGCU-3′ in the 3′-UTR of R2 mRNA, which interacts with a cytosolic protease-sensitive factor(s) to form a 45-kDa R2BP. The binding activity of the cis-element was sequence-specific. Similar to several previously published mRNA cis-elements (33Manzella J.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7077-7082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is only one copy of the 9-nt cis-element within the R2 message. The cis-element binding site showed a similar band shift complex in a variety of cells of different species, suggesting a common pathway for the regulation of R2 mRNA degradation. Mutagenesis studies indicated that there are relatively stringent primary sequence requirements for formation of the R2BP. Our results indicate that the cis-element binding activity is redox-sensitive, because formation of the cis-element-protein complex was abolished by treatment of cell extracts with N-ethylmaleimide and diamide; however, the inhibition of RNA-protein complex formation by diamide was reversed by 2% mercaptoethanol, suggesting a possible sulfhydryl switch mechanism. The present study connects, for the first time, the action of the tumor promoters TPA and okadaic acid and phosphorylation signal-controlled pathway(s) in a mechanism(s) leading to message stability that is associated with down-regulation of the R2BP activity. As expected, treatment of cells with okadaic acid, which exerts its effects by causing a net increase in the prevailing levels of phosphorylated proteins, resulted in the down-regulation of the cis-element binding activity. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the posttranscriptional regulation of ribonucleotide reductase R1 mRNA stabilization (20Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that insertion of a PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing the wild type protein binding site into a heterologous CAT gene caused message destabilization, whereas mutations introduced into the normal cis-element that eliminated formation of the R2BP had no significant effect on the stability of the CAT hybrid RNA. This result is consistent with the idea that the in vivo message destabilization of the R2 mRNA is mediated by the R2BP in cells, and down-regulation of the binding activity of this complex leads to a decrease in the degradation of R2 mRNA. We conclude that the cis-element functions as a destabilizing sequence.

CF1 likely contains six nucleotide binding sites (2Girault G. Berger G. Galmiche J.-M. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14690-14695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not all of which are catalytic (2Girault G. Berger G. Galmiche J.-M. Andre F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14690-14695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These binding sites have been partially characterized (3Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 4Shapiro A.B. Huber A.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two sites are dissociable. There are two noncatalytic sites that are tight binding only for ATP and only in the presence of Mg2+, while the two remaining sites will also bind ADP tightly and do not require Mg2+ for tight binding. “Tight” binding is used as an operational definition meaning the bound nucleotide is not removed by gel filtration or dialysis. The dissociable sites are termed “loose.” None of these sites binds AMP or adenosine. Alternation of site properties between loose and tight has been observed and appears to be induced by nucleotide binding (5Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4340-4347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One proposed model for the mechanism of catalysis (6Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 3. 1989; : 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) involves at least two catalytic sites that alternate properties. The binding of nucleotide to a loose site causes it to become a tight binding site, whereas a site containing tightly bound nucleotide becomes dissociable. Catalysis occurs when the substrate is tightly bound. Of the two sites that bind ADP tightly, one will exchange its bound ADP easily for medium TNP-ADP, while the other will not (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Until now, studies of both the activity of CF1 and the exchange of tightly bound ADP or TNP-ADP from the site that exchanges easily have been done with ADP present in the tight binding site that does not exchange easily (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The depletion of the endogenous nucleotide from CF1 would help to elucidate the function of tightly bound nucleotide and other aspects of the mechanism of catalysis. Nucleotide depletion of the CF1 homologues in Escherichia coli (8Senior A.E. Lee R.S.F. Al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and in beef heart mitochondria (9Garrett N.E. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6640-6647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been achieved. These studies have shown no change in the catalytic activity of the enzyme complex following depletion. Mitochondrial F1 was found to be less stable after nucleotide depletion (9Garrett N.E. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6640-6647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide-depleted CF1 has not been prepared previously. Procedures used to deplete the bound nucleotide contents of bacterial or mitochondrial F1, including gel filtration of CF1 in the presence of 50% glycerol (9Garrett N.E. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6640-6647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were not effective in removing ADP from CF1. This paper describes a reproducible method for nucleotide depletion of CF1 that has little effect on either ATPase activity or the stability of the enzyme. The initial binding of medium nucleotide to catalytic sites has been examined in control and nucleotide-depleted CF1. Also, the effects of tightly bound ADP on the exchange of TNP-ADP at a separate site and on Mg2+ inhibition of ATP hydrolysis were determined. The rate of the initial exchange of tightly bound TNP-ADP was compared with the change in the ATPase activity of CF1-ϵ, and the rate of increase of the activity with time was found to correspond to the amount of TNP-ADP that was released. The presence of a comparable rate of increase in activity with time in the nucleotide-depleted enzyme demonstrated that both exchange and the activity are induced by some separate event. These results help to clarify the catalytic mechanism and the interactions between nucleotide binding sites in the enzyme. Reduced CF1-ϵ was prepared from market spinach by the procedure described in Shapiro and McCarty (5Shapiro A.B. McCarty R.E. J. Biol.

Before use, CF1-ϵ was desalted by passing it consecutively through two, 3-ml Sephadex G-50 columns (11Penefsky H.S. J. Biol.

Incubation of CF1-ϵ in 10 mM EDTA for 4 h at room temperature facilitates nucleotide exchange (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). EDTA inhibits alkaline phosphatase activity and must be removed from solution by passage through two consecutive 3-ml Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl (TN buffer). This and all subsequent buffers were passed through a column of Chelex 100 resin to remove residual Mg2+ and were stored in plastic. CF1-ϵ concentration was determined by the Lowry method (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by absorbance, using an extinction coefficient of ϵ = 0.483 cm2/mg of CF1 at 277 nm (3Bruist M.F. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6298-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CF1-ϵ (15 mg) was diluted to 5 mg/ml with TN buffer, and 280 units of Stratagene calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (catalog number 600015) were added. Samples were incubated 18-20 h at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase was removed from the CF1-ϵ by DEAE-cellulose chromatography at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase was eluted from the column (0.1-ml column volume/mg of CF1 used) with 15 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, followed by elution with 45 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl. Nucleotide-depleted CF1-ϵ was eluted by 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 400 mM NaCl and was collected in 0.5-ml fractions. The CF1-ϵ fractions were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity by following p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis at 410 nm at 25°C. The fractions that contained most of the CF1-ϵ were then combined and desalted by two consecutive Sephadex G-50 columns equilibrated with TN buffer. The phosphatase activity of the CF1-ϵ-NT was 1 nmol min−1 mg CF1−1 or less. ATPase activity of CF1-ϵ in the presence of Ca2+ was assayed by the incubation of 10 µg of CF1-ϵ for 3-5 min at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM ATP, and 5 mM CaCl2. The amount of Pi produced was determined colorimetrically (13Taussky H.H. Schorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity of CF1-ϵ in the presence of Mg2+ was measured with a coupled enzyme assay at 25°C. CF1 (50 µg) was added to a mixture of 1 ml total volume containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phospho(enol)pyruvate, 5 mM ATP, 20 units each of Sigma lactate dehydrogenase (catalog number L-1254), Sigma pyruvate kinase (catalog number P-9136), and 0.25 mM NADH. The decrease in NADH concentration was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. The cold stability of CF1-ϵ-NT was monitored by loss of ATPase activity upon incubation at 0°C in the manner of Hightower and McCarty (14Hightower, K. E., McCarty, R. E., Biochemistry, 35, 4852–4857.Google Scholar). CF1-ϵ-NT was incubated at 15 µg/ml in Chelex 100-treated 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 0 and 25°C. At various times, 200-µl aliquots were taken for the assay of Ca2+- ATPase activity for 3 min at 25°C. The concentration of Pi produced was determined by the sensitive malachite green assay (15Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannerts G.P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) with modifications described elsewhere (14Hightower, K. E., McCarty, R. E., Biochemistry, 35, 4852–4857.Google Scholar). The analysis of nucleotide bound to CF1 was performed with ion-pairing high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bound nucleotides were released from CF1 by methanol precipitation (16Moal J. Le Coz J.R. Samain J.F. Daniel J.Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 93: 307-316Google Scholar). The relationship between the integrated peak area and the nucleotide quantity was determined for each experiment using nucleotide standards of known concentration. CF1-ϵ and CF1-ϵ-NT were loaded with TNP-ADP by incubation in 0.5 mM TNP-ADP for 40 min. Excess and loosely bound TNP-ADP were removed by passage of the enzyme through two consecutive Sephadex G-50 columns. The extent of TNP-ADP loading was determined by the absorbance of tightly bound TNP-ADP at 418 nm using an extinction coefficient of 2.51 × 104 mol−1 cm−1 (17Cerione R.A. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and blanked against CF1-ϵ at the same concentration that had not been loaded with TNP-ADP. Binding of TNP-ADP as well as exchange of tightly bound TNP-ADP were observed by measuring the TNP-ADP fluorescence. The fluorescence of TNP-ADP has been shown to increase linearly with the amount that is bound to CF1-ϵ (10Soteropoulos P. Ong A.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made using an OLIS-modified SLM/Aminco SPF-500 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 418 nm and the emission wavelength 560 nm. Exchange was initiated by the addition of free nucleotide into the stirred sample medium. In one experiment, exchange was initiated by stopped-flow mixing. As prepared, CF1-ϵ, stored as an (NH4)2SO4 precipitate in the presence of EDTA, contains 1.2-2 mol of tightly bound ADP/mol of CF1. Tightly bound ADP is released into the medium at a slow rate and is re-bound at a fast rate (10Soteropoulos P. Ong A.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19810-19816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase cleaves ADP to AMP and then to adenosine. Neither AMP nor adenosine binds to CF1. In principle, therefore, alkaline phosphatase should promote the removal of bound ADP from CF1, simply by pulling the equilibrium toward the dissociation of bound nucleotide. Although the mechanism of alkaline phosphatase-induced release of bound ADP has not been investigated in detail, results of preliminary experiments suggest that alkaline phosphatase attacks ADP that had dissociated from CF1. Alkaline phosphatase added to the outside of a dialysis bag containing CF1 enhanced ADP removal (data not shown). This method has been routinely effective in producing nucleotide-depleted CF1 with an ADP content determined by HPLC (Fig. 1) over 11 trials to be 0.094 ± 0.04 mol/mol of CF1-ϵ compared with an untreated control content of 1.2 ± 0.2 mol of ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ. In more recent trials, the CF1-ϵ used had a tightly bound ADP content in the range of 1.6-1.8 mol of ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ and the bound nucleotide content after depletion was correspondingly higher, in the range 0.18-0.32 mol/mol of CF1-ϵ. The nucleotide-depleted enzyme was stored in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with and without 20% glycerol, with and without 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, at 25 or 4°C and, for samples without ammonium sulfate, at −80°C. Overnight storage in 20% glycerol proved most conducive to retaining Ca2+ATPase activity, with storage at 25°C and −80°C equally effective. CF1-ϵ-NT fully retains its Ca2+ATPase activity for up to 3 weeks in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol at −80°C. Nucleotide depletion appears to have no effect on the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis activity of the enzyme. The ATPase activity of CF1-ϵ-NT was equivalent to that of CF1-ϵ with endogenous nucleotide (Table I). p-Nitrophenylphosphatase assays revealed no significant residual alkaline phosphatase activity in the CF1-ϵ-NT. To ensure that the ATPase activity measured was that of CF1-ϵ and not of residual alkaline phosphatase, Ca2+ATPase assays were also performed in the presence of tentoxin, a potent inhibitor of the ATPase activity of CF1 but not of alkaline phosphatase. The ATPase activity of CF1-ϵ-NT was fully inhibited by µM concentrations of tentoxin.TABLE ICa2+ATPase activity of nucleotide-depleted CF1-ϵ The Ca2+ATPase activity at 37°C of CF1-ϵ and CF1-ϵ-NT was averaged over 10 different preparations, and the activity of the same samples was assayed in the presence of 1 µM tentoxin to demonstrate the lack of alkaline phosphatase activity.Enzyme preparationSpecific activityµmol/min/mgCF1-ϵ14.7 ± 5.1CF1-ϵ-NT16.1 ± 5.2CF1-ϵ+ tentoxin (1 µM)0CF1-ϵ-NT + tentoxin (1 µM)0 Open table in a new tab Nucleotide depletion also has no effect on the cold stability of the enzyme. CF1 loses its ATPase activity upon exposure to low temperatures (0°C), a result of at least a partial dissociation of the complex (18McCarty R.E. Racker E. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 1966; 19: 202-214PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotides in the medium protect from the loss of ATPase activity in the cold (18McCarty R.E. Racker E. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 1966; 19: 202-214PubMed Google Scholar, 19Posorske L. Jagendorf A.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 177: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-depleted CF1-ϵ lost its ATPase activity at 0°C at a rate identical to that for CF1-ϵ (Fig. 2). The CF1-ϵ used contained 1.8 mol of tightly bound ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ, and the nucleotide-depleted enzyme contained 0.20 mol of ADP tightly bound/mol of CF1-ϵ. Measurements were taken of the effect of bound ADP on the loading of the enzyme with TNP-ADP. CF1-ϵ-NT containing 0.05 mol of bound nucleotide/mol of CF1-ϵ-NT was prepared in TN buffer. Half was loaded with ADP by incubation in 5 mM ADP for 1 h. Excess ADP was removed by passage through two consecutive Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns. TNP-ADP binding to both the nucleotide-depleted and the ADP-loaded enzyme was measured as the increase in fluorescence of TNP-ADP as it binds to the enzyme in solution (Fig. 3). When 1 µM TNP-ADP was added to 0.5 µM CF1-ϵ-NT essentially all of the TNP-ADP bound to the enzyme resulting in 1.95 mol of bound TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ. The binding was complete within 1 min. The ADP-loaded enzyme in contrast bound 1.1 mol of TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ, at these concentrations, and binding took close to 10 min to complete. When the concentration of TNP-ADP was increased to 4 µM with 0.5 µM CF1-ϵ, the nucleotide-depleted enzyme bound 2.5 mol of TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ, and the ADP-loaded enzyme bound 1.6 mol of TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that a nonexchanging or slowly exchanging tight ADP binding site exists, although it is possible that the site may be made to exchange at higher concentrations of TNP-ADP. TNP-ADP binding was studied using stopped-flow fluorescence in order to resolve the phases of binding to CF1-ϵ-NT. In this case, either CF1-ϵ-NT containing 0.20 mol of tightly bound ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ or CF1-ϵ which contained an endogenous 1.81 mol of tightly bound ADP/CF1-ϵ-NT were mixed in the stop-flow with TNP-ADP in TN buffer to a final concentration of 0.4 µM CF1-ϵ and 1.6 µM TNP-ADP (Fig. 3B). The resulting scans of fluorescence intensity versus time showed two distinct phases and were fit to Equation 1: F(t)=F1*(1−exp(−k1*t))+F2*(1−exp(−k2*))+F0(Eq. 1) where F(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t, F1 and F2 are the extent of the two phases, and k1 and k2 are their rate constants. F0 is the base-line fluorescence of the unlabeled sample with the unbound TNP-ADP. As can be seen in Table II, in the case of binding to CF1-ϵ that contains endogenous nucleotide, there is one rapid phase, the extent of which corresponds well to the filling of the 0.19 mol of empty ADP tightly bound site/mol of CF1-ϵ, and a second, much slower phase whose rate constant is a good match for those observed for exchange of tightly bound TNP-ADP (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the nucleotide-depleted sample, at these concentrations, a total of 1.4 sites are filled per CF1-ϵ, and two rate constants are observed, one equivalent to the fast rate constant from the sample with endogenous ADP, and one 9 times faster. Close to one site filled at the fast rate, with the remaining 0.5 nucleotide binding at the slower rate.TABLE IIThe rate and extent of TNP-ADP binding to CF1-ϵ and CF1-ϵ-NT Numbers represent the rate and extent of TNP-ADP binding to CF1-ϵ-NT and CF1-ϵ as defined by Equation 1, when TNP-ADP or TNP-ADP together with MgCl2 are added to a final concentration of 1.6 µM in 0.4 µM enzyme.k1k2s−1s−1CF1-ϵ+ TNP-ADP0.110.100.410.0039CF1-ϵ+ Mg2+, TNP-ADP0.180.100.350.0045CF1-ϵ-NT + TNP-ADP0.520.110.880.93CF1-ϵ-NT + Mg2+, TNP-ADP0.360.061.120.53 Open table in a new tab The measurements were repeated, mixing the enzyme solution with a mixture of MgCl2 and TNP-ADP for a final concentration of 1.6 µM for each. The sample of CF1-ϵ with its endogenous nucleotide showed an increase in its slower rate constant. The rate of exchange of bound nucleotide has been shown to be faster for medium MgADP then for ADP alone (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), a further indication that the slow rate constant represents exchange of bound ADP for medium TNP-ADP. There was a drop of about half for both rate constants for the nucleotide-depleted sample showing that binding of MgTNP-ADP to either empty site is slower than binding of TNP-ADP without Mg2+. It has previously been suggested that both of the tight ADP binding sites will exchange for medium ADP in the absence of Mg2+ (4Shapiro A.B. Huber A.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis, CF1-ϵ-NT containing 0.05 mol of ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ was loaded with TNP-ADP. This resulted in CF1-ϵ with 1.44 mol of TNP-ADP tightly bound/mol of CF1-ϵ. Exchange of the bound TNP-ADP was observed in the presence of 5 mM ADP and 5 mM EDTA for more than 10 min and fit accurately to Equation 2: F(t)=F1*exp(−k1*t)+F2*exp(−k2*)+Fmin(Eq. 2) Here F1 and F2 are the extents of a biphasic decay, and k1 and k2 are the rate constants, with Fmin = F(t = ∞). The extent of exchange was calculated from the fit, and from a base line obtained by addition of 0.1% SDS to remove all bound nucleotides. Of 1.44 tightly bound TNP-ADP, 1.1 would exchange, suggesting that if the second tight ADP site does exchange, it does so only very slowly. Mg2+ inhibits the ATPase activity of CF1 and is believed to inhibit through the formation of a tightly bound Mg2+ADP complex (20Du Z. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 402-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hochman Y. Carmeli C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6287-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether ADP was a requirement of Mg2+-induced inhibition, the activity as a function of time of CF1-ϵ-NT was observed at 25°C by the coupled enzyme assay, with and without prior exposure of the enzyme to Mg2+. The CF1-ϵ-NT contained 0.18 mol of tightly bound nucleotide/mol of CF1-ϵ, and the control was CF1-ϵ which contained 1.6 mol of tightly bound nucleotide/mol of CF1-ϵ. The activity was observed by monitoring the absorbance of NADH at 340 nm with respect to time, with the rate of change of the absorbance with respect to time giving the activity of the enzyme. The activity as a function of time fit to the empirical Equation 3: Activity (time) =ΔA(1−exp(−k1*t))−k2*t+A0(Eq. 3) where ΔA and k1, are the extent and the rate constant, respectively, of the initial increase in activity; k2 is the rate constant for a slow inhibition that underlies the first term, and A0 is the activity at t = 0, when the enzyme was added to the reaction mixture. In order to avoid the error introduced by numerical differentiation, the absorbance scans were fit to the integral of Equation 3, and the activity as a function of time was calculated from the fit. Excellent fits were obtainable by this method. As can be seen from the plots of activity versus time (Fig. 4A), incubation of the nucleotide-depleted enzyme with Mg2+ prior to the initiation of activity had relatively little effect, particularly in contrast to the enzyme containing its endogenous ADP. More can be learned from the rate constants presented in Table III. There is only slight variation in the rate constant of the initial increase in activity; however, the activity has a lower maximum value in the Mg2+-pretreated case, and the rate k2 of the underlying inhibition was much less. In contrast, in the sample of CF1-ϵ that retained its endogenous ADP, incubation with Mg2+ caused a large decrease in k1. In this case, the sample pretreated with Mg2+ showed no competing inhibitory term.TABLE IIIRate constants for the change in activity with time The rate constants as defined by Equation 3 describing the change with time of the ATPase activity of CF1-ϵ-NT and CF1-ϵ with and without incubation of the enzyme in 1 mM MgCl2 for 1 h prior to initiation of exchange by addition of the enzyme to the reaction mixture. k1 has units of min−1, and k2 has unit of µmol of Pi produced per min2/mg CF1-ϵ.CF1-ϵ-NTCF1-ϵ-NT + MgCF1-ϵCF1-ϵ+ Mgk16.22E-015.94E-018.85E-011.48E-02k21.04E-039.51E-064.21E-03−4.40E-03TNP-ADP loadedk15.07E-015.32E-016.17E-015.95E-02k28.89E-041.47E-041.70E-03−1.95E-03 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of the rate constant k1 by Mg2+ pretreatment is clearly dependent on the presence of tightly bound ADP. The inhibitory term k2 is also affected by Mg2+, but the dependence of k2 on ADP is less clear. The lower maximum activity and extremely low k2 of the nucleotide-depleted sample when pretreated with Mg2+ suggests that this inhibitory process is mostly complete in this case relative to the sample without Mg2+ pretreatment. This difference in k2 values in the nucleotide-depleted sample may result in some fashion from the remaining 0.18 mol of ADP/mol of enzyme or it may be evidence of an interaction between the enzyme and Mg2+ in solution that does not require the presence of bound nucleotide. It is interesting to note that the activity of CF1-ϵ that retained its endogenous ADP reaches a higher maximum activity then that of the nucleotide-depleted sample before falling, relatively rapidly, to the same level. The sample of CF1-ϵ had been stored as a precipitate in 50% saturated ammonium sulfate with 5 mM EDTA for several days prior to use. This procedure has been shown to produce CF1-ϵ effectively free of bound Mg2+ (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These data suggest that tightly bound ADP actually transiently enhances the activity in the absence of bound Mg2+. In order to ensure that the lag in activity described by the rate constant k1 was not the result of the coupling enzymes rather than the CF1, ADP was added directly to the reaction mix in the absence of CF1. No such lag was observed. CF1-ϵ from the same batch as the preceding experiment was loaded with ADP by incubation for 1 h in 5 mM ADP with an additional 5 mM EDTA to prevent Mg2+ binding. Excess and loosely bound ADP were removed by passage through two consecutive Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns. Both it and the CF1-ϵ-NT (0.18 mol of ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ) were loaded with TNP-ADP by incubation with a substoichiometric amount of TNP-ADP, with excess and loosely bound TNP-ADP removed by more Sephadex G-50 centrifuge columns. This resulted in a sample with 0.86 mol of TNP-ADP and 0.18 mol of ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ, and one with 0.55 mol of TNP-ADP and 1.36 mol of ADP/CF1-ϵ. The activities were measured as before both with and without Mg2+ pretreatment (Table III and Fig. 4B). Despite the presence of tightly bound TNP-ADP, there is remarkably little difference from the previous measurements. The exchange of the tightly bound TNP-ADP for medium nucleotide was observed in both samples, and 90% of the bound TNP-ADP exchanged showing that the TNP-ADP was bound mainly in the easily exchanging ADP tight-binding site. Thus, it must be the second ADP tight-binding site, the one which exchanges slowly if at all, that is responsible for the Mg2+-induced delay in the onset of ATPase activity. The fact that the easily exchanging site fills fastest is evidence that the fast phase of binding of TNP-ADP to CF1-ϵ-NT that was observed represents binding to the easily exchanging site. When tightly bound ADP was removed from CF1-ϵ, preincubation of the enzyme with Mg2+ no longer inhibited the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Whether tightly bound ADP had a similar effect on Mg2+ inhibition of the exchange of bound nucleotide for medium nucleotide was determined. CF1-ϵ-NT and CF1-ϵ were loaded with substoichiometric amounts of TNP-ADP, and the initial rate of exchange (v0) of tightly bound TNP-ADP for medium nucleotide was measured (Table IV). v0 is determined by fitting the TNP-ADP fluorescence to Equation 2 and is described by the apparent first order rate constant for exchange multiplied by the extent of exchange. Exchange under catalytic conditions (both Mg2+ and ATP present) was triphasic and fit to a suitably expanded version of Equation 2. For the purpose of comparison v0 values were scaled by the amount TNP-ADP bound to each sample when calculating the ratio of v0 for the two samples.TABLE IVThe effect of tightly bound ADP on the initial rates of exchange of bound TNP-ADP for medium nucleotide The units of v0 are nmol of TNP-ADP exchanged per min/mg Cf1-ϵ. The samples with prior Mg2+ incubation were incubated ∼1 h in 5 mM MgCl2 prior to the addition of ADP.

Thus loaded, the CF1-ϵ contained 1.09 mol of ADP and 0.85 mol of TNP-ADP per mol of CF1-ϵ. The nucleotide-depleted enzyme started with 0.16 mol of nucleotide/mol of CF1-ϵ-NT and after TNP-ADP loading contained 1.03 mol of TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ. Samples used to study exchange with medium ATP rather than ADP were the same TNP-ADP-loaded samples used for the measurements of activity as a function of time. The fraction of tightly bound TNP-ADP that would exchange was the same for sample with and without endogenous nucleotide when initiated with the same nucleotide mix, typically around 80-90%, again showing that TNP-ADP was bound mainly at the same exchangeable site in each sample. Tightly bound ADP affected exchange rates of bound TNP-ADP only in the presence of Mg2+. The variations produced in exchange rates by Mg2+, EDTA, sulfite, and Pi are comparable with what has been observed previously, with MgADP causing faster exchange than ADP, and MgADP + Pi, or MgATP and sulfite being faster still (7Digel J.G. McCarty R.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14482-14489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that Mg2+ incubation reduces the rate of exchange of the nucleotide-depleted samples both for medium ADP and ATP. It was suggested by the activity of Mg2+-incubated CF1-ϵ-NT that Mg2+ is coordinated with the enzyme prior to ADP addition. If so, the Mg2+ coordination combined with the very rapid binding of ADP shown in Fig. 3 may result in rapid inhibition of the Mg2+-pretreated enzyme in the presence of ADP. However, these samples still contained 0.18 or 0.26 mol of ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ which may be enough by itself to account for the decrease. The ability to measure both activity and exchange as a function of time provides an opportunity to compare them directly. CF1-ϵ was prepared with 0.9 mol of ADP and 1.1 mol of TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ, and from CF1-ϵ-NT a sample was prepared with 0.27 mol of nucleotide with an additional 1.3 mol of TNP-ADP/mol of CF1-ϵ. The activity of these samples was monitored using the coupled enzyme assay at 25°C, and the exchange of tightly bound TNP-ADP was observed by fluorescence using the same assay mix and sample volumes and concentrations as the activity assay also done at 25°C. The only exception was that the exchange measurements were done without NADH, the fluorescence of which interferes with the determination of TNP-ADP fluorescence. The exchange of TNP-ADP under these circumstances had three phases, one of which was faster than that which could be observed in the coupled enzyme assay, where the sample cuvette had to be mixed by inversion prior to measurement. The extent of this rapid phase as a fraction of the total observed exchange corresponds well to the earliest observed activities as a fraction of the maximum activity (A0 and the fast phase extent of Table V). This suggests that there may be a faster, unobserved phase to the increase in the ATPase activity with time and that the actual initial activity of the enzyme is much closer to zero. The maximum rate of exchange observed of the bound TNP-ADP is the initial rate (v0), as only the very first exchange turnover is observed. This rate is much less than the maximum ATPase activity of the enzyme, and even in the case of the TNP-ADP-loaded sample of CF1-ϵ-NT, it is only 10% of the initially observed activity (Table V).TABLE VComparison between exchange and the increase in activity as a function of time CF1-ϵ-NT and CF1-ϵ refer to the TNP-ADP-loaded enzyme. Amax has units of nmol of Pi/min/mg CF1-ϵ and v0 units of nmol of TNP-ADP exchanged per min/mg CF1-ϵ.

Umbach A. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 75-85Google Scholar). It was then shown that under the conditions where this exchange was observed, the initial ATPase activity was much less than the steady-state activity and that the steady-state activity was reached only after much of the tightly bound Mg[3H]ADP was released (23Du Z. Boyer P.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Using a quenched-flow apparatus it was shown that when CF1 reaches a steady-state ATPase activity, then the exchange rate also reaches a steady state that is comparable with the rate of ATP hydrolysis (24Leckband D. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2306-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As measured here it can be seen (Fig. 5) that the loss of tightly bound ADP corresponds well to the increase in ATPase activity with time. The maximum activity was considered to be the sum of A0 and ΔA of Equation 3. The actual maximum activity was slightly less owing to the underlying inhibition. The fact that the activity reaches its maximum when the exchange is only about 85% complete may be a result of the maximum activity being higher than the eventual steady-state activity. Our results show that CF1-ϵ with markedly decreased bound nucleotide may be obtained by treatment of the enzyme with alkaline phosphatase for at least 18 h. This nucleotide-depleted enzyme had rates of Ca2+- and Mg2+ATPase activity (Table I and Fig. 3) equivalent to those of CF1-ϵ with endogenous ADP. These findings are consistent with the results obtained from nucleotide-depleted E. coli and mitochondrial F1. The initial presence of tightly bound nucleotide was not required for catalysis in E. coli F1, and mitochondrial F1 exhibited no loss of ATPase activity following depletion of tightly bound nucleotide. However, bound nucleotide appears to stabilize mitochondrial F1, as the presence of 50% glycerol is required throughout the depletion and further procedures to prevent protein denaturation (9Garrett N.E. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6640-6647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our depletion procedure as well as all our assays are conducted in the absence of glycerol. Our cold inactivation data (Fig. 2) demonstrated that the absence of bound nucleotide has no significant effect on the structural stability of CF1-ϵ. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of mitochondrial or bacterial F1 may be an effective way in which to deplete these enzymes of bound nucleotide. If so, this method for gentle removal of bound nucleotide would be preferred over the more laborious chromatographic methods. In mitochondrial F1, Mg2+ forms a complex with bound ADP that inhibits catalytic activity (25Drobinskaya I.Y. Kozlov I.A. Muratliev M.B. Vulfson E.N. FEBS Lett. 1985; 182: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This has been suspected to be the case for CF1-ϵ. Due to the unavailability of nucleotide-depleted CF1-ϵ, it has not been proven conclusively that Mg2+ inhibits ATPase activity by forming a complex with bound ADP. Although Mg2+ binding to CF1 has been shown to inhibit its catalytic activity (26Carmeli C. Lifshitz Y. Gutman M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3940-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the necessity of bound ADP had not previously been demonstrated. Our studies of Mg2+ inhibition of ATPase activity (Fig. 3) of CF1 demonstrate that the neither the presence of ADP nor of Mg2+ alone is sufficient to inhibit. The presence of Mg2+ and bound ADP combined is responsible for the observed inhibition. Earlier studies of the exchange of tightly bound ADP with nucleotide in the medium (27Feldman R.I. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13088-13094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that CF1 contains one tight binding site for ADP that exchanges and whose exchange is inhibited by Mg2+. This site was considered to be the location of the endogenous ADP found in freshly prepared CF1. More recent studies have shown that there are two tight ADP binding sites (4Shapiro A.B. Huber A.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4194-4200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It now seems clear that the two tight binding sites for ADP have quite different properties. One will exchange easily for medium nucleotide and the second exchanges very slowly, if at all. This is shown in two ways. CF1-ϵ that contained endogenous tightly bound ADP would not exchange about 1 of the bound ADP for TNP-ADP, and CF1-ϵ that contained 1.44 tightly bound TNP-ADP, but no bound ADP, exchanged only about 1 of the bound TNP-ADP. A similar result has been seen in rat liver mitochondrial F1 that has been shown to contain two ADP binding sites, one of which exchanges with medium nucleotide and the second of which does not (28Pedersen P.L. Hullihen J. Bianchet M. Amzel L.M. Lebowitz M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1775-1784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is this nonexchanging, or poorly exchanging, site that appears to enable Mg2+ to inhibit the exchange of bound nucleotide from the exchangeable site, as well as being the principle source of Mg2+ inhibition of the ATPase activity. It has been suggested before (29Malyan A.N. Sov. Sci. Rev. D. Physicochem. Biol. 1994; 12: 1-98Google Scholar) that an ADP binding site separate from the catalytic site is responsible for Mg2+-induced inhibition of the ATPase activity, although it has not yet been demonstrated that the poorly exchanging site is not catalytic. In all cases in which Mg2+ was present in the exchange medium, the rate of exchange of tightly bound TNP-ADP was inhibited in samples with bound ADP relative to those with little bound ADP. It is even possible that the nonexchanging ADP site is the only site at which a bound MgADP complex inhibits exchange, although this is not yet clear due both to the residual bound ADP in the preparation and the ability of TNP-ADP to bind to the nonexchanging site when it is vacant. The exchange of TNP-ADP from the tight, easily exchanging ADP site was seen to correlate with an increase in the ATPase activity of the enzyme. The data presented in Fig. 5 and Table V might then suggest that it is the exchange of tightly bound ADP from the easily exchanging ADP tight binding site that activates the enzyme. However, it has also been seen (Fig. 4 and Table III) that nucleotide-depleted CF1-ϵ, which has no bound nucleotide to exchange, shows the same increase in activity with time. Therefore, it must be that some separate occurrence activates the enzyme, stimulating the exchange of the tightly bound TNP-ADP at the same time as the ATPase activity. Since the activity is initiated by the addition of Mg2+ and ATP to the enzyme, it seems likely that the filling of an additional nucleotide binding site is responsible. CF1-ϵ that has both of its tight ADP sites filled still shows this increase in activity over time. Thus, it would be one of the remaining sites, either the noncatalytic MgATP binding sites or the loose sites. It was shown by Milgrom et al. (30Milgrom Y.M. Ehler L.L. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18725-18728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that an increase in the ATPase activity of CF1 is correlated with an increase in MgATP bound to the enzyme. It is also possible that the first turnover of the enzyme results in some conformational change that makes the succeeding turnovers faster. We thank Kendra E.

In the present study, estrogen (E2) induction of pS2 mRNA levels was significantly reduced within 6 h following cotreatment with RA. In transient transfection experiments, RA repressed transactivation from a vitellogenin E2-responsive element by approximately 50% and wild-type RA receptor α (RARα) or RARβ enhanced this inhibition. Transfection of truncated RARα mutants terminating before or at amino acid 412 markedly decreased RA inhibition of E2-induced reporter gene activity.

Along with the E2 receptor (ER), many breast cancer cell lines express nuclear receptors for retinoic acid (RA). Retinoic acid has been shown to inhibit the growth of hormone-dependent breast cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (3Fontana J.A. Exp. Cell Biol. 1987; 55: 136-144PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ueda H.

Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1977-1982PubMed Google Scholar). Non-additive inhibition has been demonstrated between retinoids and anti-estrogens, wherein the combination of RA and anti-estrogen produced a 75% inhibition of breast cancer cell growth compared with a 50% inhibition when either agent was used alone (3Fontana J.A. Exp. Cell Biol. 1987; 55: 136-144PubMed Google Scholar, 6Koga M. Sutherland R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that each agent may produce common anti-estrogenic effects. Retinoids have been shown to decrease the production of the mRNA and protein for the progesterone receptor in MCF-7 ER+ breast cancer cells (7Clarke C.L. Roman S.D. Graham J. Koga M. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12694-12700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Clarke C.L. Graham J. Roman S.D. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol.

A distinct protein of Mr 39,000 has also been identified in breast cancer cells whose synthesis and secretion are inhibited by RA (5Fontana J.A. Miranda D. Burrows-Mezu A.

The retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family which includes the nuclear receptors for vitamin D3, E2, and thyroid hormone (9Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6276) Google Scholar). Well described properties of retinoic acid (RA) include its activity as a morphogen and a teratogen during development (see Ref. 10Gudas J.L. Cell Growth & Diff. 1992; 3: 655-662PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). This metabolite of vitamin A can also induce the differentiation of embryonal carcinoma cells as well as promyelocytic leukemia cells (11Pratt M.A.C. Kralova J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6445-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Breitman T.R. Collins S.J. Keene B.R. Blood. 1981; 57: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the biological effects of RA are thought to be mediated through the nuclear RARs, which are ligand-inducible transcription factors. Like other members of the nuclear receptor family, RARs modify the activity of associated promoters by binding to enhancer sequences in the regulatory regions of inducible genes (10Gudas J.L. Cell Growth & Diff. 1992; 3: 655-662PubMed Google Scholar, 13Freedman L.P. Luisi B.F J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Six functional domains have been described in members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Regions A and B nearest the N terminus contain a ligand-independent transcription function denoted AF-1, while region C consists of well conserved zinc finger motifs involved in DNA binding and sequence recognition (14Green S. Chambon P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). The role of regions D and F are not understood. Region E has several functions including heterodimerization, ligand binding, and ligand dependent transactivation (AF-2) (15Leid M. Kastner P. Chambon P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). There are several types of RARs including the α, β, and γ subtypes, which bind the ligands all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA and the α, β, and γ subtypes of the RXR, which bind only 9-cis-RA. The RXRs have been shown to be heterodimerization partners for RARs, thyroid hormone receptors, and vitamin D3 receptors and their presence enhances by severalfold the binding of these receptors to their preferred response elements (reviewed in Ref. 16Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Kakizuka A. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1993; 48: 99-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A compendium of genes responsive to different nuclear receptors and their ligands has been assembled, and the close similarity between these enhancer elements has become clear. The consensus DNA sequence motif to which the retinoid, vitamin D3, and estrogen receptors bind contains the half-site GGTCA in the form of a palindrome or as a direct repeat with varying numbers of spacer nucleotides (17Naar A.M. Boutin J.-M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1267-1279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 18Umesono Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). While there is clearly some selectivity with respect to receptor/enhancer identities, there is also a degree of promiscuity between receptors and enhancers (19Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J.-Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since RA inhibits the growth of E2-dependent breast cancer cells, we set out to determine if RA could inhibit E2-induced transcription and the mechanism by which this occurs. In addition, we wished to investigate the contribution of RA-induced transcriptional inhibition of the ER to the growth inhibitory activity of RA. The pS2 gene is expressed in hormone-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells in an estrogen-responsive manner, and an estrogen response element (ERE) has been identified in its 5′ regulatory sequences (20Brown A.M.C. Jeltsch J.-M. Roberts M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6344-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have shown that treatment of MCF-7 cells with RA inhibits E2-induced increases in pS2 mRNA as well as transcription from a vitellogenin-ERE (Vit-ERE). Cotransfection of wild-type RARα into MCF-7 cells increases the inhibition of E2-induced transcription, while transfection of receptors lacking the AF-2 region of the RARα markedly reduce this inhibition. The results are consistent with ligand-dependent transcriptional interference between the AF-2 region of the RARα and the ER and suggest that inhibition of the E2-responsive gene expression by RA may play a role in RA-mediated growth inhibition in ER+ breast cancer cells. RNA was extracted using the LiCl/urea procedure (21Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). RNA was separated on 1% agarose 1.1 M formaldehyde gels then transferred and cross-linked to Hybond N (Amersham Corp.). Hybridization was carried out with multi-prime labeled cDNA probes for pS2 (22Jakolew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowsky P. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and tubulin to control for loading equivalency. MCF-7 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 0.3% glucose, and 5% fetal bovine serum. For experiments involving E2 induction, MCF-7 cells were grown for 7 days to 80% confluence in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% 2 × dextran/charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. The medium was changed 12 h before the addition of ligands. For transfection experiments MCF-7 cells were grown to 90% confluence in α-minimal essential medium, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium changed to phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% 2 × stripped fetal bovine serum. The following day the cells were split and allowed to grow for 48 h in E2-free medium as described above before transfection. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitate method (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Routinely, 5 µg each of vitellogenin-thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (Vit-CAT), cytomegalovirus-LacZ, and either pcDNA3 or expression plasmids for the RARα and C-terminal mutants of the RARα were cotransfected for 6-8 h, after which the DNA-CaPO4 precipitate was removed and the cells shocked with 20% glycerol. Fresh E2-free media containing the appropriate ligands or vehicle alone were added, and the cells incubated for an additional 36 h. CAT assays were performed as described (25Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and results presented have been normalized to β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiencies. For stable transfections, cells were grown to 90% confluence after removal of the precipitate, then trypsinized and plated into fresh dishes for selection in 50 µg/ml G418. Individual colonies were picked and expanded prior to Northern analysis of total RNA to assay for expression of the transfected gene. Triplicate cultures of MCF-7 cells or MCF-7(RARα′) cells were plated at low density in six-well dishes and cultured for 18 h prior to the addition of vehicle or RA (10−6 M). Medium and drug were changed on day 3 of all experiments. Viable cells were enumerated by trypan blue exclusion. Typically cells remained 90-95% viable after treatment. Receptor plasmids were linearized and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), then translated into cold protein in reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Protein amounts were estimated by performing parallel translations in the presence of [35S]methionine and subjecting the labeled protein to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as well as scintillation counting of incorporated [35S]methionine. The sequences of the Xenopus vitellogenin A ERE (26Klein-Hitpass L. Schorpp M. Wagner U. Ryffel G.U. Cell. 1986; 46: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) oligonucleotides used as probes were: 5′-CTAGAAAGTCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGATCAAT-3′ (sense) and 5-′ATTGATCAGGTCACT GTGACCTGACTTTCTAG-3′ (antisense). The RARE sequences were based on the RAREβ enhancer (27Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and were: 5′-AAGGGGATCCGGGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGAAGATCTCGAGTGAACTTTCGGTGAACCCTACCC-3′ (antisense). The sense and antisense strands were labeled separately with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase, then annealed and incubated with in vitro translated proteins in the presence of 100 µg/ml poly(dI·dC) and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in a total volume of 20 µl for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-bound oligonucleotide was separated from free probe in a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in low ionic strength buffer, and the dried gel was subjected to autoradiography at −70°C for 2 h. The pS2 cDNA and RXRβ were the gifts of Dr. Pierre Chambon. The RARα cDNA was provided by Dr. Vincent Giguere and the vitellogenin-thymidine kinase-ERE-CAT plasmid was obtained from Dr. Martin Petkovich. The RARα′ expression plasmid was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment containing the entire coding sequence for RARα′ (11Pratt M.A.C. Kralova J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6445-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing the cytomegalovirus promoter. RARα414Δ′ and RARα404Δ′ terminate at these amino acid residues and were generated by exonuclease III and mung bean nuclease digestion of the hRARα in pTZ18R, followed by insertion into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Fig. 1). RARα mutants 412Δ and 419Δ (28Tate B.F. Grippo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) terminate at these residues and were digested with EcoRI and HindIII, blunted, and the receptor fragments subcloned into pcDNA3. The mutant receptors E415A/E418A and ML413,414Δ, which contain alanine replacement of specific residues or deletion of residues respectively in RARα 419Δ (28Tate B.F. Grippo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pcDNA3 for expression in MCF-7 cells. These plasmid constructs contain in-frame stop codons (28Tate B.F. Grippo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and dideoxy sequencing. The pS2 gene encodes a secreted polypeptide with homology to a pancreatic protein, which inhibits gastrointestinal motility and acid secretion (22Jakolew S.B. Breathnach R. Jeltsch J.M. Masiakowsky P. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and is expressed under the control of E2 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. To study the effect of RA on an endogenous E2-inducible gene, Northern blot analysis of pS2 gene expression was performed on MCF-7 cells treated for up to 8 h with 10−8 M E2 with or without 10−7 or 10−6 M RA. The results in Fig. 2 show that, as expected, cells grown in phenol red-free medium and 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 7 days did not produce pS2 mRNA, while cells treated for 24 h with E2 expressed the pS2 transcript. After 3 h of exposure to E2, there was little difference between cells treated with either concentration of RA. However, by 6 h of E2/RA exposure, there was markedly less pS2 transcript level in cells treated with 10−6 M RA compared with untreated cells, and by 8 h this decrease was more pronounced and also evident in cells treated with 10−7 M RA. To determine if RA inhibition of E2-induced transcription might be due to inhibition of ER binding to the ERE, we performed in vitro binding experiments. The result in Fig. 3 shows the gel mobility shift analysis obtained when equimolar amounts of the RARα, mutant RARα′, and RXRβ were incubated individually or together with the ERE oligonucleotide. As expected, only the ER bound with high efficiency to the ERE as a homodimer. The RARα and RARα′ both bound the ERE as heterodimers with the RXRβ, although with much reduced efficiency compared with the ER, and did not compete with the ER when present in equimolar amounts. In addition, we have not observed RA-mediated decreases in the expression of the ER (data not shown). Under the conditions used for binding and electrophoresis, we did not observe binding of the RXRβ to the ERE. In contrast, the RARα·RXRβ heterodimer bound with high efficiency to an RARE oligonucleotide derived from the direct repeat RARβ-2 enhancer (RAREβ), while the ER alone or in combination with RXRβ did not. The results above indicated that RA can inhibit the E2 induction of an endogenous E2-responsive mRNA. In order to test whether or not this inhibition occurred at the transcriptional level, a reporter gene construct containing the Xenopus vitellogenin ERE linked to CAT was transfected into MCF-7 cells and the cells were treated with E2 or E2 and RA. Fig. 4 shows the results of a typical experiment. Addition of E2 to the cells resulted in an approximate 6-fold induction of CAT activity, while the simultaneous addition of RA decreased the activation of this promoter by about 50% (Fig. 4 and Table I). To evaluate the role of the RARα on RA-mediated inhibition of E2-dependent transcription, an RARα expression plasmid was cotransfected into the cells with the Vit-CAT reporter gene construct. Transfection of wild-type RARα into MCF-7 cells resulted in an approximate 30% increase in the fold induction of CAT activity as a result of a decrease in control background levels of transcription (Fig. 4). The presence of transfected RARα in these cells also resulted in significantly greater inhibition of E2-induced transcription following treatment with RA. As our results showed that the liganded RARα could function to inhibit E2-induced transcription, we set out to determine which part of the receptor mediates this effect. Since the C terminus of the RAR has been shown to be important for ligand-dependent transcriptional activation (29Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner Durand B. Nakshatri H Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 30Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of introduction of a C-terminally truncated mutant of the RARα on RA inhibition of the E2 response. MCF-7 cells were transfected with a truncated mutant of the RARα called RARα′, which is missing 70 amino acids from the C terminus such that all of the of the F domain and a small fraction of the ligand binding domain are deleted. This receptor has been shown previously to be a dominant repressor of RA-induced transcription from RA response elements (11Pratt M.A.C. Kralova J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6445-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Table I shows that, in contrast with the wild-type RARα, E2 induction of gene transcription was only weakly inhibited by addition of RA. To further delineate the region of the RARα necessary for interference with the ER, we cotransfected mutants of the RAR downsteam of the RARα′ truncation into MCF-7 cells along with the Vit-CAT reporter gene (Table I and Fig. 4). Slightly better RA inhibition was obtained following transfection with the RARα C-terminal deletion mutants 404Δ′ and 412Δ, although it still remained below 30%. Transfection of RARα deletion mutants 414Δ′ and 419Δ resulted in recovery of RA-induced inhibition of the E2-induced Vit-CAT activity to wild-type levels. To define this region more precisely, we transfected the RARα mutants, ML413,414Δ and E415A/E418A, both of which terminate at amino acid 419, into MCF-7 cells along with the Vit-CAT reporter gene. The RARα ML413,414Δ prevented RA inhibition of E2-induced CAT activity to the same extent as 412Δ and the other larger deletions while RARα E415A/E418A produced wild-type levels of inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that either one or both of the AF-2 region amino acid residues 413 and 414 are essential for mediating RA-dependent inhibition of ER transactivation.TABLE IRA inhibition of E2-induced transcription in MCF-7 cells expressing C-terminal deletions of the RARαExpression plasmidInhibition%pcDNA350.1 ± 2.4RARα′18.4 ± 8.8RARα404Δ′29.0 ± 4.2RARα414Δ′61.4 ± 9.4RARα65.4 ± 2.0RARβ74.3 ± 4.5pcDNA3(T-47D)28.6 ± 1.8 Open table in a new tab Interference with E2-induced Transcription by RA Is a Dominant Effect In order to determine whether RA inhibition of E2-responsive transcription is RARα concentration-dependent, we transfected various concentrations of the RARα mutant Δ412 into MCF-7 cells.

Transfection of as little as 0.25 µg of 412Δ significantly reduced RA-mediated inhibition of E2-induced ERE activation, an effect that remained almost constant for all transfected expression plasmid concentrations up to 2.5 µg. As noted for all RARα expression plasmid transfections, the control background levels of CAT activity decreased in an RARα concentration-dependent manner, resulting in a net increase in overall fold induction in the presence of E2. In order to assign a role for the RARα in RA antagonism of E2-induced growth, we have stably transfected MCF-7 cells with RARα′ expression plasmids. Four high expressing clones were obtained, two transfected with pcDNA3-RARα′, and two with CMX-RARα′ (Fig. 6, A and B, respectively) as assessed by Northern blot analysis. These clones were then assayed for growth inhibition by RA. The results shown in Fig. 7 (A and B) indicate that treatment of with 10−6 M RA over a 5-day period resulted in an 70% growth inhibition of untransfected MCF-7 cells and a clone of transfected MCF-7 cells, which did not express the CMX-RARα′ expression vector. In contrast, both clones of MCF-7(pcDNA3-RARα′) cells were less than 30% growth inhibited at the end of the treatment period (Fig. 7, C and D) and the MCF-7 (CMX-RARα′) cells were completely refractory to growth inhibition (Fig. 7, E and F). In addition, while growth-inhibited clones underwent a characteristic change in morphology consisting of increases in intercellular spaces and the formation of processes, no such changes were observed in the MCF-7 (CMX-RARα′) clones (data not shown).Fig. 7RA-mediated growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells.

Exp. Cell Biol. 1987; 55: 136-144PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ueda H. Takenawa T. Millan J.C. Gesell M.S. Brandes D. Cancer. 1980; 46: 2203-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Fontana J.A. Miranda D. Burrows-Mezu A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1977-1982PubMed Google Scholar), however the molecular basis of inhibition is yet to be defined. One way in which retinoids could antagonize the effects of E2 on growth is by preventing E2-induced transcription. Previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding the ability of RA to inhibit E2-induced transcription in MCF-7 cells; however, it has been suggested that the discrepancies may be due to clonal variations in the expression of the RARs and ERs (31Van der Burg B. Vander Leede B.M. Kwakkenbos-Isbrucker L. Salverds S. de Laat S.W. van der Saag P.T. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 91: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that RA inhibits E2 induction of the endogenous pS2 gene as well as a transfected E2-responsive promoter reporter gene construct in MCF-7 ER-positive breast cancer cells. Fontana et al. (32Fontana J.A. Nervi C. Shao Z.-M. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3938-3945PubMed Google Scholar) and Demirpence (33Demirpence E. Pons M. Balaguer P. Gagne D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Demirpence E. Belaguer P. Trousse F. Nicolas J.C. Pons M. Gagne D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1458-1464PubMed Google Scholar) have both shown that retinoids antagonize the E2 induction of pS2 mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells after 24 and 12 h of RA treatment, respectively. In the present study, we have shown that RA significantly inhibits E2 induction of pS2 mRNA within 6 h of treatment with both ligands. The reason for this delay in inhibition is not clear but may be due to a lower affinity of the RAR·RXR complex for an ER coactivator molecule(s) (see discussion below) and/or the requirement for the expression of additional RARs such as the RARβ to achieve transcriptional inhibition. Potential mechanisms of RA-induced transcriptional inhibition include the possibility that RA bound to transcriptionally inactive RARα·RXRβ heterodimers on the ERE might directly block transactivation by the ER. In this scenario the RARα′·RXR heterodimers would be deficient in binding to the ERE when compared with wild-type RARα:RXR heterodimers. However, the results of the gel shift analysis suggests that this is not the case since both wild-type RARα·RXRβ and RARα′·RXRβ heterodimers bind equally weakly to the ERE. This weak binding may be responsible for the detected ligand independent inhibition of E2-induced transcription upon transfection of both the wild-type RARα and mutant RARs, which decreased the relative levels of both background and E2-induced transcription. Demirpence et al. (34Demirpence E. Belaguer P. Trousse F. Nicolas J.C. Pons M. Gagne D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1458-1464PubMed Google Scholar) used chimeric receptors containing a GAL4 DNA binding domain and ER C-terminal domain to show that the DEF region of the ER is insufficient to confer RA-sensitivity to E2-induced transactivation and suggested that RA inhibits ER transactivation by direct interference at the level of the ERE in MCF-7 cells. They did not, however, show that RA increases the binding of RAR complexes to the ERE, which would be a requirement in a model of ligand-induced transcriptional inhibition. A second possibility is that the ligand bound RAR·RXR complex titrates out a common auxiliary factor, which is necessary for transactivation by both retinoid receptors and ERs. Transcriptional interference between the steroid receptors for E2, progesterone, and glucocorticoid has been shown to involve both the N terminus and the hormone binding domain of these receptors (35Meyer M.E. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Bocquel-Tasset D. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 57: 433-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Danielian et al. (36Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) have suggested that the C terminus of the hormone binding domain in steroid hormone receptors contains sequences necessary for ligand dependent transcriptional activation. Supported by earlier structure/function studies of the ER and RAR (37Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 39Gronemeyer H.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) have found that the region between residues 404 and 419 in the RARα contains the C-terminal transactivation function. Notably, three of the residues in this region (Glu-412, Met-413, and Leu-414) are conserved in the AF-2 region of the ER (36Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Similar inhibition of the E2 response following transfection of the RARβ-2 is consistent with the involvement of this part of the AF-2 region, as it is also conserved in this receptor (36Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The observation that mutant RARα receptors in which amino acids 413 (Met) and 414 (Leu) are deleted effectively prevent the RA inhibition of E2-stimulated gene transcription demonstrates the participation of the AF-2 in ligand-dependent transcriptional interference with the ER. This observation supports that of Barettino (41Barettino D. Vivanco Ruiz M.M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3039-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), who showed that the glucocorticoid receptor can interfere with the activity of the RAR, while the glucocorticoid receptor mutant M770A/L771A cannot. Recent evidence has suggested that the C terminus of the ER binds several factors (42Cavaillès V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), which may include the proteins ERAP160 (43Halachmi S. Mardon E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M. Science. 1994; 264: 1455-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) and RIP140 (44Cavailles V. Dauvois S. L'Horset F. Lopez G. Hoare S. Kushner P.J. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3741-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), both of which modulate ER activity. Notably, the RAR can also bind ERAP 160 (43Halachmi S. Mardon E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M. Science. 1994; 264: 1455-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Another candidate for such a factor is the mammalian homologue of S. cerevisiae SW12/SNF2 and Drosophila brahma (45Khavari P.A. Peterson C.L. Tamkun J.W. Mendel D.B. Crabtree J.R. Nature. 1994; 366: 170-174Crossref Scopus (531) Google Scholar) called BRG-1, which has been shown to be a cooactivator for both the ER and RAR (46Chiba H. Muramatsu M. Nomoto A. Kato H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1815-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The yeast SNF protein, SPT6, also enhances ER activity and binds to the AF-2 region of the ER (47Baniahmad C. Nawaz Z. Baniahmad A. Gleeson M.A.G. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 34-43PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of mutant receptors to repress RA inhibition of E2-induced gene transcription is independent of ligand binding, since while 412Δ, ML413,414Δ and 414Δ′ can all bind all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA, the RARα′ is predicted to be incapable of binding either all-trans-or 9-cis-RA (28Tate B.F. Grippo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20258-20263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Since the inhibition of RA-mediated repression of E2-induced transcription by AF-2 region mutants was a dominant effect, we suggest that RA inhibition requires heterodimerization with limiting amounts of RXR in MCF-7 cells. To this end, we 2M. A. C. Pratt and D. Novosad, unpublished data. and others (48Segars J.H. Marks M.S. Hirschfeld S. Driggers P.H. Martinez E. Grippo J.F. Wahli W. Ozato K. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have shown that MCF-7 cells express low levels of all RXRs compared with RARα levels. Interestingly, we found a much reduced RA-mediated inhibition of the E2 response in T-47D cells, which may reflect differences in relative levels of RARs, RXRs, and ERs between these two cell lines. These cells may also harbor a different complement of ER coactivator(s), which do not bind with high affinity to the RAR. ER− cells transfected with the RAR acquire sensitivity to retinoid-mediated growth inhibition (50Sheikh M.S. Shao Z.-M. Li X.-S. Dawson M. Jetten A.M. Wu S. Conley B.A. Garcia M. Rochefort H. Fontana J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21440-21447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, while inhibition of E2-induced transcription might contribute to RA inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth, it is likely that RA-responsive transcriptional activation or inhibition also contributes to growth inhibition of MCF-7 cells. Pretreatment of mammary carcinoma cells with retinol inhibits the growth response to transforming growth factor-α (51Halter S.A. Winner A.R. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and RA antagonizes gene expression from the AP-1 and serum response elements (52Schüle R. Rangarajan P. Yang N. Kliewer S. Ransone L.J. Bolado J. Verma I.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6092-6096Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 53Busam K.J. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19971-19977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoid treatment of breast cancer cell lines also reduces AP-1 activity (54van der Burg B. Slager-Davidov R. van der Leede B. de Laat S.W. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The RARα′ acts as a dominant inhibitor of RA-responsive gene transcription (11Pratt M.A.C. Kralova J. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6445-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus we cannot rule out the possibility that the significant reduction in growth inhibition observed in RA-treated MCF-7(RARα′) clones may be the result of both the lack of inhibition of E2-induced transcription as well as the negative effect on RA-responsive genes. Because we have mapped the region of the RARα that interferes with ER transactivation to the AF-2 region, it is not possible to generate an RARα mutant that inhibits ER transactivation and is not a dominant negative mutant with respect to RA-induced transcription. Our data suggest that RA inhibition of the ER-mediated transactivation of E2-responsive genes involves the binding of a common transcriptional accessory factor by retinoid receptors. The ability of AF-2 region mutants to prevent RA inhibition of E2-induced transcription in a dominant manner supports the notion that ER interference requires the formation of RAR·RXR heterodimers. In this respect, heterodimer formation between RARs and RXRs has been shown to be required for dominant negative activity (30Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 55Saitou M. Narumiya S. Kakizuka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19101-19107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our results support a model wherein expression of an RARα lacking the AF-2 motif results in the recruitment of RXR molecules into complexes with mutant RARα, which are unable to bind an accessory transcription factor(s) regardless of whether or not they bind ligand. Future studies will focus on identifying one or more of these common transcriptional accessory factors in MCF-7 cells. We are grateful to Balwant Tuana for encouragement and helpful discussion."

We report the presence and characterization of a soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) distinct from a membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase (mAC) that is also present in Sf9 cells. sAC was purified 3,500-fold to near homogeneity; a single band at 25 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis correlated well with adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity. The purified enzyme had a catalytic activity of 0.1 µmol/min·mg and the Km of 0.55 mM for the substrate ATP. In contrast to mAC, sAC was heat-stable. Enzymatic activity of sAC was not stimulated by forskolin and was inhibited by salts at high concentrations. sAC utilized both manganese- and magnesium-ATP as substrate. Di- or triphosphate-containing nucleotides, such as GTP and GDP, as well as pyrophosphate, noncompetitively inhibited sAC. Our data suggest that the physical and biochemical characteristics of sAC are different from those of mAC in Sf9 cells as well as from those of other known forms of adenylyl cyclase in animal cells; sAC in Sf9 cells may constitute a new member of adenylyl cyclase found in animals.

It is well known that cAMP plays a widespread role in the control of gene expression and the integration of hormonal stimulation (1Gilman A.G. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1990; 24: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase is widely expressed in many organisms from bacteria to animals (2Peterkofsky A. Reizer A. Reizer J. Gollop N. Zhu P. Amin N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Danchin A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 109-162PubMed Google Scholar). Although this enzyme invariably converts ATP to cAMP, its other biochemical and physical properties vary among species. In bacteria, adenylyl cyclase exists within the bacterial body to integrate metabolic function (the enterobacterial form). In some bacteria, such as Bacillus anthracis (4Leppla S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar), adenylyl cyclase is secreted as a toxin and is activated by calmodulin in the host cell, facilitating the bacterial invasion of the target animal cell (the calmodulin-activated toxin form). In animals, on the other hand, adenylyl cyclase exists in a membrane-bound form to integrate hormonal stimulation. Typically, this membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase has tandem repeats of a six-transmembrane structure and a cytoplasmic catalytic domain similar to a transporter or ion channel (5Greenberger L. Ishikawa Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1994; 4: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Regulation of this membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase by the receptor/G protein and the production of cAMP as a second messenger within the cell are the two common features conserved in both non-vertebrates and vertebrates. A calmodulin-sensitive form of adenylyl cyclase from Drosophila, unlike the bacterial form, shares the same membrane topology and the amino acid sequence in the catalytic domain with a calmodulin-sensitive form of adenylyl cyclase found in mammalian brains (type I). This Drosophila adenylyl cyclase is also capable of coupling to the endogenous mammalian G protein when overexpressed in mammalian cells (6Levin L.R. Han P.-L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L. Reed R.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 479-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Thus, the properties of adenylyl cyclase in animals, including its structure and its functional interaction with other signal components, are well conserved between non-vertebrates and vertebrates. The germ cells of animals, however, contain an additional form of adenylyl cyclase that displays physical and functional properties markedly different from those of the membrane-bound form (7Braun T. Dods R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Neer E.J. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 9: 69-83PubMed Google Scholar, 9Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5808-5812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This adenylyl cyclase is not stimulated by G protein or forskolin. It is active only in the presence of manganese, but not magnesium, and is unaffected by fluoride or gonadotropic hormones (10Kornblihtt A.R. Flawia M.M. Torres H.N. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 11Braun T. Frank H. Dods R. Sepsenwol S. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus this adenylyl cyclase is regulated differently from the hormonally regulated adenylyl cyclase found in somatic cells; its physical properties are similar to those of adenylyl cyclase found in bacteria, an indication that the adenylyl cyclase in germ cells may be an ancestral form of mammalian adenylyl cyclase. However, attempts to characterize this soluble adenylyl cyclase have been hampered by its limited availability in germ tissues; in the absence of a cultured cell line to study this adenylyl cyclase, sperm has so far provided the only source. Sf9 cell, an ovarian cell from Spodoptera frugiperda, or fall armyworm, has been widely used as a host cell of baculovirus to express recombinant proteins. We and others have successfully overexpressed the membrane-bound form of mammalian adenylyl cyclase in this cell (13Feinstein P.G. Schrader K.A. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 7290-7296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sf9 cells, like other animal cells, have an endogenous membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase that is stimulated by GTP and forskolin (16Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have noticed that there is an additional form of adenylyl cyclase that is exclusively expressed in the cytosolic fraction of this cell. In this study, we attempt to answer two questions. First, what are the physical properties of this soluble adenylyl cyclase in Sf9 cells as compared with those of the membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase? Second, how are the biochemical characteristics of this adenylyl cyclase different? Our data suggest that the adenylyl cyclase found in Sf9 cells is similar to the bacterial form of adenylyl cyclase, as well as to the form of adenylyl cyclase found in mammalian germ cells; it may constitute a new member of the adenylyl cyclase family found in animals. We obtained S. frugiperda Sf9 cells from the American Tissue Culture Collection (CRL 1711) or Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Cells were grown in Grace medium containing 4% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 µg/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). For harvesting, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and stored at −70°C until use. We performed adenylyl cyclase assays by incubation at 30°C in a reaction buffer containing 20 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM cAMP, 1 mM creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.1 mM [α-32P]ATP (about 1 µCi/assay tube), unless otherwise specified. After 20 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2% SDS. We measured the production of cAMP as described previously (19Ishikawa Y. Katsushika S. Chen L. Halnon N.J. Kawabe J. Homcy C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13553-13557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined either by the method described by Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215608) Google Scholar) or by staining with Amido Black (21Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. All purification steps were performed at 4°C. We thawed frozen cells (about 5 × 109) in 100 ml of a homogenization buffer containing 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units of egg white trypsin inhibitor, 20 µg/ml L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 20 µg/ml 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 2 µg/ml aprotinin). The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation (800 p.s.i., 30 min). Cavitated cells were centrifuged at 500 × g to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the homogenization buffer and used as “the membrane fraction.” The supernatant was passed through a 0.45-µm filter membrane and was used as “the cytosolic fraction.” We also purified adenylyl cyclase protein from this fraction. The cytosolic fraction was loaded onto a DEAE-MemSep-1500 column (Millipore) at 10 ml/min using the ConSep LC100 system (Millipore). The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 20 mM NaCl, followed by elution with 15-min gradient from 20 to 200 mM NaCl in buffer A. The adenylyl cyclase activity typically eluted at 100 mM NaCl (Fig. 1A, top). These fractions with high adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity were concentrated to 2-3 ml by use of a Centricon 30 (Amicon). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Sephacryl-200 HR column (1 × 80 cm, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mM NaCl. Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Fractions with adenylyl cyclase activity were pooled in a final KPO4 concentration of 20 mM. We then loaded the pooled samples onto four hydroxyapatite columns (1 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad), equilibrated with buffer B (20 mM KPO4, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Each column was washed with 10 ml of buffer B (40 mM KPO4). Gravity elution was performed in 5-ml increments with increasing KPO4 concentrations (50, 60, 70, 80, and 100 mM in buffer B). Adenylyl cyclase activity usually eluted between 60 and 70 mM KPO4. These fractions were concentrated by use of a Centricon 30. The concentrated samples were applied again onto a Sephacryl-200 HR column under the same conditions described above. The fractions with high adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity were pooled (Fig. 1A, middle) and applied onto an ATP-Sepharose column (1 × 8 cm, Sigma) equilibrated with buffer C (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer C at a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and eluted with 20-min gradient from 0 to 2 mM ATP in buffer C (Fig. 1A, bottom). Fractions with high catalytic activity were pooled (2.5 ml), and ATP was repeatedly removed at different dilutions and concentrations by use of a Centricon 30. The active fractions were pooled and stocked at −70°C. We first noticed the presence of adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity in the cytosol of Sf9 cells when we purified a recombinant membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase (14Kawabe J. Ebina T. Ismail S. Kitchen D. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24906-24911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This catalytic activity ceased during the purification process, indicating that the physical properties of this putative adenylyl cyclase were different from those of the membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase. We further investigated the adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity present in the cytosol of Sf9 cells. We used the cytosolic fraction obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, followed by filtration through a 0.45-µm filter membrane. The pellet was used as the membrane-bound form of adenylyl cyclase in Sf9 cells (mAC). 1The abbreviations used are: mACmembrane-bound adenylyl cyclasesACsoluble adenylyl cyclaseGTPγSguanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Table I summarizes the characterization of adenylyl cyclase from the cytosolic fraction (sAC). sAC had a basal activity 2-fold greater than that of mAC. sAC was insensitive to GTPγS (∼100 µM) or forskolin (∼100 µM) stimulation that in the same conditions increased the catalytic activity of mAC 3-4-fold. When the membrane and cytosolic fractions were mixed and assayed in the presence of GTPγS (100 µM), the enhancement of catalytic activity was similar to that of the membrane fraction alone (data not shown), a finding that suggests membrane-associated GTP-binding proteins do not affect the catalytic activity of sAC. sAC was also insensitive to the purified GTPγS-Gsα. The Km for the substrate ATP was different; sAC had a 4-fold greater Km value and thus a lower affinity for ATP. With a relatively high intracellular concentration of ATP (∼10−3 M), we estimate that more than 80% of all catalytic activity takes place in the cytosolic fraction of Sf9 cells under nonstimulated conditions.TABLE I.Effects of forskolin and GTPγS on adenylyl cyclases from Sf9 cells The cytosolic and membrane fractions of Sf9 cells (5-10 µg) were assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of 100 µM GTPγS or 100 µM forskolin. In order to obtain Km values, adenylyl cyclase assays were performed in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and an increasing concentration of ATP (0.02 to 2 mM) (14Kawabe J. Ebina T. Ismail S. Kitchen D. Homcy C.J. Ishikawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24906-24911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

It is possible, although unlikely, given our findings, that the cytoplasmic adenylyl cyclase is released from mAC by proteolysis. Several examples of this mechanism are known (22Anderson W.B. Jaworski C.J. Vlahakis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2921-2926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Marshak D.R. Neer E.J. J. Biol.

However, we did not find more of the enzyme in the cytosol when there was a delay in processing the cells even though the delay left more time for proteolysis to take place than when cell disruption and centrifugation occurred without delay. The specific activity of sAC was not altered by the methods of cell disruption (sonication, nitrogen cavitation, or homogenization with a Polytron). When mammalian mAC was overexpressed, the catalytic activity in the cytosolic fraction did not increase over that in nonoverexpressing cells. In addition, High Five cells, another insect germ cell line derived from Trichoplusia ni egg cell homogenates, possessed a similar adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity in the cytosol (data not shown). Our characterization indicated that sAC is a cytoplasmic enzyme distinct from mAC. We therefore decided to purify and further characterize this novel soluble adenylyl cyclase from Sf9 cells. Fig. 1A shows a purification profile described under “Experimental Procedures” that is summarized in Table II. We obtained good yields in the first three steps with a 30-fold purification, whereas in the last three steps, in which a further 100-fold purification was achieved, we obtained rather poor yields. The overall recovery of the enzymatic activity after ATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography was 2%. We typically obtained 1-2 µg of protein from 500 mg of cytosol proteins. Fig. 1B shows a SDS-PAGE analysis of the final product with a Coomassie staining, as well as an example of how intensity of the different protein bands correlates with adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity at each step of the purification process. The fractions from the ATP-Sepharose column with the highest activity showed a single band of molecular mass = 25 kDa. The intensity of this band always and exclusively correlated with adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity; we therefore concluded that this band of molecular mass = 25 kDa is likely to encode sAC. Based upon the intensity of staining, we estimate the purity of the final product to be at least 90%. Thus, a 3500-fold purification was required to obtain enzyme that is >90% pure. Taking our purification data from the profile, we calculate that adenylyl cyclase represents 0.025% of the total cytosolic protein in Sf9 cells. It is unlikely that we underestimated the purification as a result of inactivation during purification because sAC was, unlike adenylyl cyclase in Escherichia coli (25Yang J.K. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3750-3758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), very stable. Indeed, even when the crude cytosolic fraction was left at room temperature overnight, a significant portion of adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity was retained. We did not obtain more than 100% recovery in any step, which indicates that serious overestimation is also unlikely.TABLE IIPurification of soluble adenylyl cyclase (AC) from Sf9 cells Soluble adenylyl cyclase was purified from 500 mg of cytosolic proteins of Sf9 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For adenylyl cyclase assays, aliquots from each fraction were incubated in a reaction buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2 for 15 min at 30°C.StepVolumeAC activityProteinTotal ACYieldPurificationmlpmol/min · mgmg/mlpmol/min%foldCytosol94.0314.88014,1291001DEAE-MemSep3.232110.02011,26075111st Sephacryl 2009.08831.0508,3465929Hydroxyapatite9.53,0290.1103,16522982nd Sephacryl 2006.55,3090.0421,44910172ATP Sepharose2.2109,8930.00122023568 Open table in a new tab To measure the molecular mass of sAC in its native condition, partially purified fractions, after undergoing DEAE-MemSep chromatography, were loaded on a Sephacryl-200 column and the elution profile was obtained using protein molecular mass standards. The activity eluted in a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 40 kDa (Fig. 2). The apparent size difference between SDS-PAGE and gel chromatography may be due to the structural nature of sAC, the formation of dimer in native condition, or a protein-matrix interaction in the gel. This size (40 kDa) was unchanged when fractions from different purification steps, such as the initial crude cytosolic fraction and eluate from the hydroxyapatite column, were similarly analyzed by gel filtration, which indicates that the size difference is not due to degradation of sAC during purification. When eluate from the hydroxyapatite column was subjected to a microfiltration membrane, Centricon 30, with the molecular mass cutoff of 30 kDa, the adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity was completely retained, a finding that suggests the size of sAC in native condition is greater than 30 kDa. The size of sAC in Sf9 cells is apparently different from that of sAC in mammalian testis, which shows a molecular mass = 52 kDa on SDS-PAGE and 50 kDa by gel filtration (26Braun T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). sAC in Sf9 cells is much smaller than many bacterial adenylyl cyclases (80-200 kDa) and membrane-bound forms of adenylyl cyclase (100-120 kDa) (3Danchin A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 109-162PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, sAC in Sf9 cells is likely the smallest adenylyl cyclase so far identified in animal cells, although we await the results of a future cloning study to determine the exact size. The small size of sAC in Sf9 cells is similar to that found in Rhizobium meliloti (20 kDa) (27Lathigra R. O'Regan M. Kiely B. Boesten B. O'Gara F. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both NaCl and KCl inhibited the catalytic activity of sAC at high concentrations (Fig. 3); the potency of inhibition was similar for both salts at the IC50 value of 500 mM. This inhibition was reversible; catalytic activity recovered completely and rapidly after the salts were extracted. Similar salt-mediated inhibition was reported in the adenylyl cyclase of E. coli. (25Yang J.K. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3750-3758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also examined the hypothesis that salt inhibition was due to disassociation of the putative homodimer (40 kDa) into monomers (25 kDa). Fractions from 5 to 150 kDa were obtained by gel filtration (Sephacryl-200) in the presence of 500 mM NaCl. When diluted to 50 mM NaCl, the 40-kDa fraction recovered adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity, whereas the 25 kDa fraction did not. Thus it is very unlikely that the inhibition of sAC catalytic activity by salts is the result of disassociation. In contrast to the potent inhibitory effect of salts, no change in the catalytic activity of sAC was not detected in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol at 0-50 mM (Fig. 4). Therefore, disulfide links do not seem important in maintaining its catalytic activity. sAC was resistant to heat inactivation (Fig. 5). After 1-h incubation at 37°C, the catalytic activity of sAC decreased by 10%, whereas that of mAC decreased 40%; at 55°C for 1 h, mAC was totally inactivated while sAC was mostly (>60%) alive. The presence of manganese was not an absolute requirement to maintain the catalytic activity of sAC in Sf9 cells (Fig. 6). However, the increase of catalytic activity of sAC was manganese and magnesium concentration-dependent and reached its maximum at 1 mM for both cations. The maximal activity was higher by 30% with magnesium than manganese. This property is similar to that of mAC (28Pieroni J.P. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), adenylyl cyclase from E. coli (25Yang J.K. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3750-3758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and adenylyl cyclase from yeast (29Heideman W. Casperson G.F. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7087-7091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast with the sAC found in mammalian testis, which is stimulated by manganese, but not by magnesium (9Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5808-5812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kornblihtt A.R. Flawia M.M. Torres H.N.

Acta. 1977; 481: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Adenosine and its analog, deoxyadenosine, inhibited the catalytic activity of mAC, but not of sAC (Fig. 7). At 100 µM adenosine or deoxyadenosine, 40-50% of catalytic activity was inhibited in mAC while no inhibition was seen in sAC. This finding suggests that sAC, unlike mAC, lacks P-site regulatory sites, although it remains possible that activated sAC is sensitive to P-site inhibition. This is in contrast to mammalian testicular sAC, which is readily inhibited by P-site inhibitors upon stimulation with forskolin (30Onoda J.M. Braun T. Wrenn S.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1907-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The inhibition of catalytic activity of sAC by GTP at higher concentrations (>0.1 mM) was dose-dependent. Kinetics studies revealed that this inhibition by GTP was noncompetitive (Fig. 8) with the Ki of 0.98 mM. This inhibition was not unique to GTP; di- or triphosphate analogs of ATP or its related reagents also inhibited sAC. The assays were performed using partially purified adenylyl cyclase in the absence of the ATP regeneration system. At 5 mM, the order of inhibition potency was pyrophosphate > GTP > NADP = GDP = ADP (Table III). AMP, cAMP, and adenosine showed no inhibition. Notably, pyrophosphate, but not monophosphate, inhibited sAC. This finding is similar to that obtained from the adenylyl cyclase in E. coli; PPi releasing from the enzyme-product complex is slow and a rate-limiting step (25Yang J.K. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3750-3758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).TABLE III.Effects of nucleotides on adenylyl cyclase activity Catalytic activities of the purified soluble adenylyl cyclase from the second Sephacryl 200 chromatography (1-5 µg) were measured in the presence of various nucleotides (5 mM). The reaction buffer contained 0.2 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCl2 but not the ATP regeneration system. The value of adenylyl cyclase activity is shown as a percentage of control in the absence of nucleotide.AgentsAdenylyl cyclase activity% of controlGTP47GDP79ADP83NADP82AMP99cAMP99AdenosineaTested at 1 mM.97Pyrophosphate9Monophosphate97a Tested at 1 mM. Open table in a new tab We also examined the effects of calcium/calmodulin, protein kinase C, and nitroprusside; none showed an effect on sAC activity (data not shown). Similarly, no guanylyl cyclase-like activity was detected when cGMP formation was measured by the use of the purified enzyme (data not shown). The above data suggest that, having such a high enzyme catalytic activity and without any apparent stimulators, sAC is regulated, unlike mAC, in an inhibitory manner, rather than in a stimulatory manner. Candidates for the putative physiological regulator of sAC may include nucleotides and salts, as shown in our study. sAC in Sf9 cells is clearly distinct in physical properties from mAC in Sf9 cells, and has more in common with sAC found in mammalian testis. The enzyme catalytic activity was, like that of sAC in testis, stable and nonresponsive to forskolin (26Braun T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several biochemical properties of sAC in Sf9 cells, such as pyrophosphate inhibition, sensitivity to salts, and probable lack of P-site inhibition, are similar to those of bacterial adenylyl cyclase. These data suggest that sAC in Sf9 cells is a form of adenylyl cyclase that shares some properties with both bacterial adenylyl cyclase and the mammalian sAC found in germ cells. sAC from Sf9 cells may be a novel animal form of adenylyl cyclase; it may also serve as a good experimental model to study how the cAMP signal is regulated nonhormonally in animal cells.
