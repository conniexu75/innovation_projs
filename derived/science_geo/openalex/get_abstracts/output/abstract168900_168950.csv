https://openalex.org/W2042463129,Federal courts are increasingly being called upon to adjudicate disputes involving controversial new biomedical technologies or government efforts to control environmental and health risks. The authors cite some examples and examine various proposals that have been made to better equip the courts to deal with these complex disputes. They conclude that the proposals fall seriously short by focusing on questions of technical competence without addressing the basic moral and public policy implications of modern science and technology.
https://openalex.org/W2040519348,"A detailed account of the John Darsee fraud case at the Harvard Medical School is presented, describing the nature of Darsee's work at Harvard and his relationships with colleagues and mentors both before and after his confession to fabrication of data. University authorities took little action against Darsee during the six months before NIH questioning of discrepancies in one of Darsee's studies led to public disclosure. Committees at Harvard and NIH will investigate."

https://openalex.org/W2078223937,"Efforts to regulate technological activities have led to confusing and inconsistent government actions, delays in realizing the benefits from scientific advances, huge financial burdens, and doubtful protection. In the absence of a clear decision-making authority on technological issues, appeal from regulations is frequently sought in the courts. A new approach to regulation is proposed in which the tasks of investigating a technological activity and of making decisions are separated. The former would be carried out by an investigatory agency charged with and enabled to determine the negative aspects of the technological activity, the latter by politically appointed decision boards. The boards would consider the negative evidence presented by the investigatory agency and balance it against the benefits of the proposed activity."

https://openalex.org/W1651590122,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) decided earlier this year to require special prior approval for all future grant requests from Dr. Martin Cline, of the University of California at Los Angeles, because of his unauthorized experiments on human patients involving the use of recombinant DNA techniques. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, one of three NIH institutes funding research by Cline, has now taken the further step of prematurely terminating its current grant to Cline."

https://openalex.org/W2039515522,The tardiness of actions by Harvard officials when faced with confessed fraudulent research conducted by John Darsee is contrasted with the more rapid responses by authorities in the cases of William T. Summerlin (Sloan-Kettering) and Vijay Soman (Yale).
