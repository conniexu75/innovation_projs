Previous work suggested that Abhd5, a protein activator of Atgl, coordinates with Plin in controlling basal and stimulated lipolysis; however, the underlying mechanism is controversial. The present experiments investigated protein trafficking and interactions among Plin, Atgl, and Abhd5 in live cells. The results demonstrate that Plin binds Abhd5 with high affinity and thereby suppresses the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl. Sequestration of Abhd5 appears to a major mechanism by which Plin reduces basal lipolysis. Phosphorylation of Plin on serine 492 or serine 517 rapidly releases Abhd5 from Plin, allowing Abhd5 to directly interact with Atgl. Imaging experiments demonstrated that the Plin-dependent interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl occurs mainly, but not exclusively, on lipid droplets that contain Plin.

For example, phosphorylated Plin provides a docking site by which phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) gains access to substrates at the surface of LDs (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P.

Adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl, also known as desnutrin, Pnpla2) also participates in protein kinase A (PKA)-stimulated lipolysis (6.Zechner R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R.

Unlike HSL, Atgl is not a direct target of PKA phosphorylation, and therefore, the mechanism of its activation must be indirect. One model whereby Plin could indirectly regulate Atgl activity is by controlling availability of its co-activator, Abhd5 (also known as CGI-58), in a manner that depends on PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Plin (3.Granneman J.G.

According to this “sequestration-release” model, Plin sequesters Abhd5 in the basal state, thereby preventing activation of Atgl and suppressing basal lipolysis. PKA activation leads to Plin phosphorylation, release of Abhd5, and subsequent activation of Atgl. This mechanism is supported by biochemical and dynamic imaging experiments demonstrating that Abhd5 binds Plin in the unstimulated state, and PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Plin leads to rapid release of Abhd5 from Plin (3.Granneman J.G.

Although these data are consistent with the general model, there are no data demonstrating that 1) the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl is mutually exclusive (that is, Plin suppresses the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl) or that 2) phosphorylation of Plin promotes the physical interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl. In fact, an alternative model has been described whereby Atgl regulates basal but not stimulated lipolysis (1.Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). According to this model, basal lipolysis is stimulated by a ternary complex containing Plin, Abhd5, and Atgl. Furthermore, the model proposes that Abhd5 is not involved in PKA-stimulated activation of Atgl because it is released into the cytoplasm upon Plin phosphorylation. In the experiments detailed below, we examined the functional interactions among Plin, Abhd5, and Atgl using RNA interference as well as a panel of dynamic protein-protein interaction assays. Results from these experiments indicate the interaction of Plin and Abhd5 regulates basal and stimulated lipolysis. Protein complementation assays indicate that the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl is mutually exclusive and that its interaction with Plin predominates in the basal state. We identify the PKA phosphorylation sites on Plin that are necessary for releasing Abhd5 and further demonstrate that phosphorylation of these sites mediates the PKA-dependent interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl. Finally, we show that the PKA-dependent interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl occurs mainly on lipid droplets containing Plin. Construction and validation of fluorescently tagged proteins and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) partners have been described (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L.

The generation of Gaussia princeps luciferase protein complementation constructs (15.Remy I. Michnick S.W. Nat.

Mutation of PKA phosphorylation sites 1–4 (Ser-81, Ser-222, Ser-276, Ser-433) and site 5 (Ser-492) and site 6 (Ser-517) in Plin was performed by PCR. Cos7 were transfected with Plin-EYFP, Abhd5-Cherry, and ECFP-Atgl, incubated with oleic acid (200 μm complexed to bovine serum albumin) overnight to promote lipid droplet formation, and imaged live the next day. Cos7 or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were grown in 24-well plates and transfected in quadruplicate with N- and C-luciferase fragments fused to Atgl and Abhd5 along with wild type- or phosphorylation-defective Plin or various controls as specified in the figure legends. For competition experiments, N and C complementation probes were cotransfected with competitors (ECFP-Adrp or ECFP or Plin-ECFP) at a plasmid ratio of 2:2:1. After transfection, cells were cultured for 18–24 h in media containing oleic acid. For experiments examining the effects of PKA activation, media was replaced with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking phenol red, and cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle control) or with a mixture of forskolin/IBMX (2 μm/200 μm final concentration) for 1 h. Luciferase activity was determined as previously described (16.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Mottillo E.P. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3049-3057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). FRET analysis was performed as previously described (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3T3-L1 cells were transfected with ECFP-Abhd5 and wild type or mutant Plin-EYFP, then loaded with oleic acid overnight. Experiments were performed at room temperature in HEPES-buffered Krebs-Ringer solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Images were captured one time per min under basal conditions and after application of forskolin and IBMX to yield a final concentration of 2 and 200 μm. Cos7 were transfected with complementary BiFC fragments fused to Atgl and Abhd5 along with wild type or phosphorylation-defective Plin-ECFP. In some experiments cells were transfected with complementary BiFC fragments fused to Atgl and E262K Abhd5 in the presence of wild type Plin-ECFP. Cells were incubated overnight at 30 °C in media supplemented with oleic acid, then transferred to a recording chamber containing Krebs buffer and bovine serum albumin. Cells were recorded at time = 0 and at 15-min intervals after stimulation with forskolin/IBMX. Images were acquired with an Olympus IX-81 microscope equipped with a spinning disc confocal unit. Images were captured using a 60× 1.2 NA plan apo water immersion lens and a Hamamatsu ORCA cooled CCD camera. The following Chroma filter sets were used for the indicated fluorophores: mCherry, 41043; EYFP and Venus BiFC, 31044; ECFP, 41028; EYFP FRET, exciter from 41028 and the dichroic/emitter from 31044. Microscope control and data acquisition were performed using IPlabs (Scanalytics, BD Biosciences) software. FRET was performed using the three-filter method and net FRET calculated using the FRET extension of IPlabs software as previously described (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To quantify the BiFC signals, the subcellular domain containing Plin-ECFP LDs was defined for each frame using the autosegmentation tool of IPlabs, and the net (total minus background) fluorescence intensities of those pixels in the EYFP (BiFC) channel was summed for each frame. Background fluorescence was determined by the mean fluorescence intensity of an area immediately adjacent to the cell of interest. Total intensities were normalized to basal BiFC value for each cell, then averaged for presentation. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were maintained and differentiated in 10-cm plates as previously described (13.Moore H.P. Silver R.B. Mottillo E.P. Bernlohr D.A. Granneman J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43109-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Four days after induction of differentiation, cells were trypsinized and replated (1.5 × 105 cells/well; 3–6 wells/siRNA) in collagen-coated 24-well plates containing media and 100 nm siRNA and DharmaFECT Duo Reagent (Dharmacon). For single gene knockdown, cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA (siCon, Dharmacon D-056623-04) or Abhd5 siRNA (siAbhd5, Dharmacon D-04227-01/04, mixed 1:1). For double knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with 50 nm siCon or siAbhd5 or siPlin and 50 nm siGlo (Dharmacon D001600-01) or 50 nm each of siAbhd5 and siPlin for double knockdown. Transfection media was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum on the following day, and cells were incubated for 3 days before testing. For experiments examining the effects of Abhd5 and Plin siRNA on basal lipolysis, cells were washed and incubated in Krebs-Ringer buffer with 10 mm HEPES and 2% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin containing 3 nm phenylisopropyladenosine. For experiments examining the effects of Abhd5 siRNA on Atgl activity, cells were incubated with 3 nm phenylisopropyladenosine (basal) or 10 μm forskolin and 1 mm IBMX (stimulated) in the presence of 2 μm BAY59–9435, a selective HSL inhibitor. The medium was collected at 3 h, and triplicate wells analyzed for free fatty acid content using a Wako reagent kit. Immunoblotting for Abhd5 (16.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Mottillo E.P. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3049-3057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and Plin (13.Moore H.P. Silver R.B. Mottillo E.P. Bernlohr D.A. Granneman J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 43109-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) was performed on the same wells used in lipolysis assay to confirm the level of knockdown. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance, and group means were compared by the Bonferroni test. Previous immunochemical analyses have shown that endogenous Plin and Abhd5 are colocalized on LDs in the basal state, whereas Atgl is found both in the cytosol and on LDs (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9.Subramanian V. Rothenberg A. Gomez C. Cohen A.W. Garcia A. Bhattacharyya S. Shapiro L. Dolios G. Wang R. Lisanti M.P. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 30490-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKA activators reduce the colocalization of Abhd5 with Plin while improving its colocalization with Atgl. Although these morphological results are generally consistent with the sequestration-release model, they did not provide proof for the model because they fail to address specific protein-protein interactions at the molecular level. Thus, many key tenets and predictions of the sequestration-release model remain untested. In this study we generated a panel of fluorescently tagged proteins and devised sensitive protein-protein interaction assays to investigate the interactions of Plin, Abhd5, and Atgl in live cells. Cos7 cells were triple-transfected with Plin, Abhd5, and lipase-inactive (S47A) Atgl that had been tagged with distinct fluorescent proteins. Wild type and lipase-inactive Atgl are targeted identically (16.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Mottillo E.P. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3049-3057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 17.Smirnova E. Goldberg E.B. Makarova K.S. Lin L. Brown W.J. Jackson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas use of inactive Atgl avoids confounding effects of lipase activity on intracellular lipid droplet content (16.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Mottillo E.P. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3049-3057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As expected from previous analysis of endogenous proteins, Plin-EYFP and Abhd5-Cherry were highly colocalized on LDs (Fig. 1A). In contrast, ECFP-Atgl was both cytosolic and on LDs; however, its colocalization with Abhd5-Cherry was very poor. Thus, although Abhd5 can interact with both Plin and Atgl, its interaction with Plin predominates in cells. To explore this directly, we compared binary interaction of Abhd5 with Plin or Atgl using a luciferase protein complementation assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, the interaction of Abhd5 and Plin reconstituted 6 times more activity than did the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl (p < 0.001) and reflected differences in the subcellular colocalization of the fluorescent proteins. The above results indicate that the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin predominates over its interaction with Atgl under basal conditions and suggests that the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl might be mutually exclusive. If the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl is mutually exclusive, then expression of Plin should reduce the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl. If, however, Abhd5 can bind Plin and Atgl simultaneously, then the presence of Plin should not influence Abhd5-Atgl interactions. We tested the mode of Abhd5 interactions using luciferase and fluorescence complementation assays in transfected Cos7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of Plin-ECFP suppressed Abhd5-Atgl luciferase complementation by 72% compared with the lipid droplet protein Adrp (p < 0.01). Similarly, Plin-ECFP suppressed Abhd5-Atgl fluorescence complementation by 85% compared with ECFP (Fig. 1D, p < 0.01). These data strongly indicate that the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl is mutually exclusive in cells. Plin phosphorylation rapidly decreases the molecular proximity between Plin and Abhd5 on LDs, as determined by FRET (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Mouse PlinA has six consensus PKA phosphorylation sites that are thought to contribute to various aspects of Plin function (1.Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 4.Miyoshi H. Souza S.C. Zhang H.H. Strissel K.J. Christoffolete M.A. Kovsan J. Rudich A.

To gain further insight into this regulation, we mutated specific PKA phosphorylation sites on Plin and examined the effects on Plin-Abhd5 interactions in live cell 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, forskolin/IBMX rapidly decreased energy transfer between ECFP-Abhd5 and Plin-EYFP. Mutation of PKA sites 1–4 had no effect on forskolin-induced disruption of FRET between Abhd5 and Plin, indicating involvement of PKA sites 5 and/or 6. Independent mutation of site 5 or 6 had no effect on forskolin-induced inhibition of FRET; however, forskolin-induced changes in energy transfer were absent when both sites were mutated. These results identify sites 5 or 6 of PlinA as necessary and likely sufficient determinants of PKA-dependent regulation of Plin-Abhd5 interaction. The sequestration-release model predicts that phosphorylation-dependent release of Abhd5 by Plin will facilitate the interaction of Abhd5 with its target lipase. This hypothesis was tested in protein complementation assays using wild type and phosphorylation-defective Plin mutants as well as a mutant Abhd5 (E262K) that has greatly reduced interaction with Plin (Ref. 10.Yamaguchi T. Omatsu N. Matsushita S. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30490-30497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S1). As shown in Fig. 3A, forskolin/IBMX treatment increased the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl by nearly 3-fold (p < 0.001). The effect of PKA activation was absent in cells expressing Plin that cannot be phosphorylated by PKA as well as in cells expressing E262K Abhd5, which binds poorly to Plin. These data demonstrate that the PKA-dependent regulation requires the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and the phosphorylation of one or more PKA sites on Plin. We next investigated the Plin phosphorylation sites that mediate the increase in Abhd5-Atgl interaction and found that single mutation of sites 5 or 6 had no effect, whereas mutation of both of these sites prevented stimulation of Abhd5-Atgl interaction by forskolin/IBMX (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in which FRET experiments were performed (supplemental Fig. S2). These data demonstrate a common molecular basis for the PKA-induced dissociation of Abhd5 from Plin, as determined by FRET, and its association with Atgl, as determined by luciferase complementation. It is not known where the PKA-induced interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl takes place, and hypothetical models that address this point disagree (1.Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 19.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 19: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Attempts to observe FRET between tagged Abhd5 and Atgl were not successful. Therefore, we turned to BiFC, which is highly sensitive because the complemented fluorescence, indicative of Abhd5-Atgl interaction, is nearly irreversible and, thus, accumulates over time (20.Hu C.D. Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Cos7 cells were transiently transfected with Plin-ECFP and complementary fragments of Venus fused to Abhd5 and Atgl (Fig. 4A). Cells in the resting state had low levels of Venus fluorescence, and increased fluorescence complementation was detected within 15 min of forskolin/IBMX stimulation and accumulated and linearly over time (see supplemental Video 1). Although some fluorescence complementation was observed in the cytoplasm, the greatest increase in BiFC was observed on LDs containing Plin, as determined by line scans (Fig. 4A, lower). Forskolin/IBMX-induced Abhd5-Atgl BiFC was absent in cells expressing phosphorylation-defective Plin (Fig. 4B, left). Furthermore, PKA-induced Abhd5-Atgl BiFC was significantly reduced (but not completely eliminated) in cells expressing the E262K Abhd5 which poorly interacts with Plin (Fig. 4B, right). The experiments above indicate that Plin is a negative regulator of basal lipolysis due to its ability to sequester Abhd5. To validate this prediction in adipocytes, we examined the effects of single and double siRNA knockdown of Abhd5 and Plin on lipolysis in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 5A, knockdown of Plin greatly increased basal lipolysis. Knockdown of Abhd5 reduced basal lipolysis somewhat in the presence of Plin. Importantly, Abhd5 knockdown largely eliminated the rise in lipolysis produced by loss of Plin, indicating that Abhd5 lies downstream of Plin in the control of basal lipolysis. Plin phosphorylation is required for PKA-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes, and this effect appears to involve both Atgl and HSL (4.Miyoshi H. Souza S.C. Zhang H.H. Strissel K.J. Christoffolete M.A. Kovsan J. Rudich A. Kraemer F.B. Bianco A.C. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol.

Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 996-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To better gauge the role of Abhd5/Atgl during PKA activation we examined lipolysis in the presence of BAY59–9435, a selective and potent inhibitor of HSL that does not inhibit Atgl (21.Mottillo E.P. Shen X.J. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E1188-E1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, knockdown of Abhd5 reduced both basal and stimulated lipolysis (p = 0.007), with the greatest absolute reduction occurring under stimulated conditions. Together, these results indicate that Plin regulates adipocyte lipolysis in part through reversible interactions with Abhd5. Growing evidence indicates Plin plays a central role in organizing lipolytic effector proteins and directing their interactions in a PKA-dependent fashion (19.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 19: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 22.Brasaemle D.L. Subramanian V. Garcia A. Marcinkiewicz A. Rothenberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 326: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Loss of function experiments have clearly demonstrated the importance of Atgl and Abhd5 in the control of basal and stimulated lipolysis (11.Yamaguchi T. Omatsu N. Morimoto E. Nakashima H. Ueno K.

Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 309-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar); nonetheless, the mechanisms involved are not understood as the specific interactions among molecular effectors of lipolysis have not been directly investigated in cells. We previously proposed a model whereby Plin indirectly regulates Atgl activity by controlling accessibility of its co-activator, Abhd5, in a manner that depends on PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Plin (supplemental Fig. S3). According to this model, Abhd5 is sequestered by Plin in the basal state, thereby preventing activation of Atgl and reducing basal lipolysis. PKA activation leads to Plin phosphorylation, release of Abhd5, and subsequent activation of Atgl. This model is consistent with several observations (19.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 19: 3-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), including the demonstration that Abhd5 is a potent activator of Atgl and that Plin binds Abhd5 in the basal state and releases it after phosphorylation. Nonetheless, several key elements and predictions of the proposed model have not been established. In fact, an alternative model has been described whereby Atgl regulates basal but not hormone-sensitive lipolysis (1.Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 22.Brasaemle D.L. Subramanian V. Garcia A. Marcinkiewicz A. Rothenberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 326: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). According to this model, basal lipolysis is stimulated by a ternary complex containing Plin, Abhd5, and Atgl. Furthermore, the model proposes that Abhd5 is not involved in PKA-stimulated activation of Atgl because it is released into the cytoplasm upon Plin phosphorylation. The present work explored specific mechanistic relationships among lipolytic effectors with a panel of fluorescent reporters and novel cellular protein-protein interaction assays. Protein complementation assays established that interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl in live cells is mutually exclusive and that the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin predominates under basal conditions. It is well known that Plin suppresses lipolysis (24.Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), although the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. The results of protein interaction assays predict that Plin suppresses lipolysis in part by sequestering Abhd5 from Atgl. We verified that knockdown of Plin greatly increases basal lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Importantly, this increase in lipolysis was nearly eliminated by knockdown of Abhd5, indicating that Abhd5 acts downstream of Plin in the control of basal lipolysis. These data do not support a model in which basal lipolysis is mediated by a ternary complex of Plin, Abhd5, and Atgl as loss of Plin promotes basal lipolysis and the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin and Atgl is mutually exclusive. Previous investigations of the dynamic interactions between Plin and Abhd5 by FRET demonstrated that PKA activation rapidly decreases the molecular proximity between Abhd5 and Plin in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation of one or more PKA sites in Plin (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Plin is a multifunctional protein, and recent work indicates that phosphorylation of specific sites controls distinct functional responses (1.Brasaemle D.L. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2547-2559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). For example, of the six consensus PKA sites, site 5 (Ser-492) is thought to control lipase-independent droplet fragmentation (25.Marcinkiewicz A. Gauthier D. Garcia A. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11901-11909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), whereas site 6 (Ser-517) is required for full lipase activation (8.Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H. Stancheva Z.S. Kraemer F.B. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 996-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The present experiments indicate that phosphorylation of either site 5 or 6 of Plin is sufficient to release Abhd5. Although release occurs with similar kinetics, it is unclear whether these sites constitute independent means of decreasing the interaction of Abhd5 with Plin. Regardless, identification of these critical PKA sites provided a powerful means of testing whether dissociation from Plin is mechanistically linked to its association with Atgl. We tested whether Plin phosphorylation controls the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl using PKA-defective Plin mutants as well as a mutant of Abhd5 that does not bind Plin. The results establish that PKA activation promotes the interaction of Abhd5 with Atgl, and this effect requires the initial interaction of Abhd5 with Plin as well as the phosphorylation of Plin. Importantly, the molecular requirements of phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of Abhd5 from Plin, as measured by FRET, are exactly those required for association of Abhd5 with Atgl, as measured by luciferase complementation. The observation that mutation of PlinA Ser-517 did not affect release of Abhd5 or its binding to Atgl was somewhat surprising as this mutation has been reported to disrupt activation of lipolysis in transfected differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (8.Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H. Stancheva Z.S. Kraemer F.B. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 996-1002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This indicates that phosphorylation of Plin Ser-517 might perform another function required for lipolysis in addition to promoting the binding of Abhd5 to Atgl. It is also possible that cell background is important; for example, Plin-dependent activation of hormone-sensitive lipase appears to require Atgl in some cells but not others (8.Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. Souza S.C. Shen W.J. Zhang H.H. Stancheva Z.S. Kraemer F.B. Obin M.S. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol.

Previous immunofluorescence analyses have detailed PKA-induced changes in the subcellular colocalization of endogenous lipolytic effectors (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar); however, interpretation of these results was tentative as immunofluorescence analysis was performed on fixed cells and did not detect specific interactions. In contrast, BiFC allows continuous imaging of specific protein-protein interactions in live cells and is, thus, a powerful means of identifying the subcellular sites of PKA-induced, Plin-dependent Abhd5-Atgl interactions. We established that Abhd5-Atgl BiFC signals were inhibited by Plin in the basal state and that the PKA-dependent interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl required phosphorylation of Plin as well as the initial interaction of Abhd5 with Plin. The PKA-dependent interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl was detected on intracellular structures that lack Plin as well as lipid droplets containing Plin; however, the greatest increase in that interaction occurred on lipid droplets that contain Plin. Thus, although Atgl is mostly cytosolic in the basal state and sustained PKA activation disperses Abhd5 from Plin-containing LDs, PKA activation clearly increases the interaction of Abhd5 and Atgl at the LD surface. PKA-stimulated lipolysis involves activation of both HSL and Atgl, which together constitute nearly all triglyceride lipase activity in fat cells (27.Schweiger M. Schreiber R. Haemmerle G. Lass A.

Previous investigators reported that knockdown of Abhd5 reduced lipolysis mediated by these lipases in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (11.Yamaguchi T. Omatsu N. Morimoto E. Nakashima H. Ueno K. Tanaka T. Satouchi K. Hirose F. Osumi T. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1078-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that knockdown of Abhd5 reduced stimulated fatty acid efflux when HSL was inhibited. The magnitude of the reduction reflected the partial knockdown achieved, reinforcing the conclusion that Abhd5 plays a critical role in PKA-activated lipolysis independent of HSL. In addition, Abhd5 contributes to basal lipolysis as its knockdown also reduced HSL-independent fatty acid efflux from unstimulated cells. This is likely due to a small fraction of Abhd5 that is not sequestered by Plin in the basal state. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that expression of Plin did not completely abolish Abhd5-Atgl interaction. The present work probed the organization and interaction of lipolytic effectors by overexpressing specific reporter constructs. Although this may be viewed as a limitation, we note that the subcellular targeting of the reporters in transfected cells corresponds closely to that of the endogenous counterparts in adipocytes (3.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5726-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the functional impact of these interactions has been verified here and recently elsewhere (12.Bezaire V. Mairal A. Ribet C. Lefort C. Girousse A. Jocken J. Laurencikiene J. Anesia R.

Chem. 2009; 284: 18282-18291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) using RNA interference of endogenous lipolytic effectors. How the interactions of Abhd5 and Atgl are regulated in tissues lacking Plin, like muscle and liver, is an important area of future research. Available evidence suggests that specific members of the Plin protein family could contribute to cell-specific regulation of stored triglyceride. In this regard, we have recently shown that Plin5 (also known as MLDP and LSDP5) binds Abhd5 in muscle and coordinates its interaction with Atgl (16.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Mottillo E.P. Zhu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3049-3057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This interaction appears to promote basal lipolysis but may not be involved in stimulated lipolysis as forskolin does not affect FRET between Abhd5 and Plin5. 3J. G. Granneman, unpublished information. In summary, our results demonstrate that Plin regulates the molecular interaction of Abhd5 with its target lipase, Atgl, in a fashion that depends on PKA-dependent Plin phosphorylation. The sequestration of Abhd5 by Plin appears to be a major means by which Plin suppresses lipolysis, and we speculate that compounds capable of interfering with this interaction would mimic Plin phosphorylation and, thus, promote lipolysis in fat cells. Efforts are under way to identify such compounds, as they might serve as leads for novel anti-obesity therapeutics. We thank Z. Zhu, L. Zhou, and R.

https://openalex.org/W2040847783,"Polyketides are a class of natural products with diverse structures and biological activities. The structural variability of aromatic products of fungal nonreducing, multidomain iterative polyketide synthases (NR-PKS group of IPKSs) results from regiospecific cyclizations of reactive poly-beta-keto intermediates. How poly-beta-keto species are synthesized and stabilized, how their chain lengths are determined, and, in particular, how specific cyclization patterns are controlled have been largely inaccessible and functionally unknown until recently. A product template (PT) domain is responsible for controlling specific aldol cyclization and aromatization of these mature polyketide precursors, but the mechanistic basis is unknown. Here we present the 1.8 A crystal structure and mutational studies of a dissected PT monodomain from PksA, the NR-PKS that initiates the biosynthesis of the potent hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B(1) in Aspergillus parasiticus. Despite having minimal sequence similarity to known enzymes, the structure displays a distinct 'double hot dog' (DHD) fold. Co-crystal structures with palmitate or a bicyclic substrate mimic illustrate that PT can bind both linear and bicyclic polyketides. Docking and mutagenesis studies reveal residues important for substrate binding and catalysis, and identify a phosphopantetheine localization channel and a deep two-part interior binding pocket and reaction chamber. Sequence similarity and extensive conservation of active site residues in PT domains suggest that the mechanistic insights gleaned from these studies will prove general for this class of IPKSs, and lay a foundation for defining the molecular rules controlling NR-PKS cyclization specificity."

In addition, PKB has been proposed to modulate the canonical Wnt signaling through direct stabilization and nuclear localization of β-catenin.

Developmental signaling cascades typically transduce signals from the cell surface onto regulatory sequences of nuclear target genes. In the simplest model, signals transduced through different pathways are integrated at the level of the regulatory elements of individual genes. Such regulatory elements may be viewed as assemblies of cis-acting response elements that are tailored to create the unique expression pattern for each gene. However, numerous studies propose that signaling pathways may interact at any stage between the plasma membrane and the nucleus. One mechanism by which such cross-talk may occur involves the sharing of a common component between two different pathways. It is often tacitly assumed that such shared components are equally accessible to all pertinent pathways. Glycogen synthase kinase 3-α and -β, collectively termed GSK3, are constitutively active serine/threonine kinases (1.Kockeritz L. Doble B. Patel S. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Drug Targets. 2006; 7: 1377-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). GSK3 features in two signaling pathways that are of particular importance in cancer. GSK3 is a downstream component of the phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) 2The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseAPCadenomatous polyposis coli proteinPKBprotein kinase BBRAFv-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1PTENphosphatase and tensin homologTCFT cell factor. pathway (2.Cully M.

Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). Growth signals, activated Ras proteins, or loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) all activate PI3K, which in turn phosphorylates and activates protein kinase B (PKB) (3.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). Active PKB phosphorylates GSK3α on Ser-21 (4.Sutherland C. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and GSK3β on Ser-9 (5.Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), in both cases leading to inhibition of the constitutive kinase activity. GSK3 is also a component of the Wnt cascade (6.Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar). GSK3 is bound by Axin (Axis inhibition protein) (7.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylates β-catenin, thus targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Wnt signaling is assumed to block GSK3-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation, leading to the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (6.Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how the Wnt cascade controls the activity of the dedicated Axin1-bound GSK3 pool. A recent genetic experiment has demonstrated that removal of the inhibitory serines from the two GSK3 proteins has no effect on Wnt signaling (8.McManus E.J. Sakamoto K. Armit L.J. Ronaldson L.

Although an early study proposed that the two pathways do not cross-talk at the level of GSK3 (9.Ding V.W. Chen R.H. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32475-32481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), a multitude of papers have since appeared that are based on the premise that a single pool of GSK3 is targeted by both signals (see supplemental Table S1). Moreover, direct stabilization of β-catenin by the PI3K/PKB pathway has been claimed in several additional studies (see supplemental Table S1). Mutational activation of the Wnt pathway through loss of adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC), Axin1/2, or through point mutations in β-catenin occurs in a limited diversity of cancers, most notably of the intestine (6.Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar), and it is characterized by stabilized β-catenin and constitutive transcriptional activity of β-catenin-TCF complexes in the nucleus. This can be readily read out by the constitutive activity of β-catenin/TCF reporters such as pTOPFlash (10.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar). Mutational activation of the PI3K pathway occurs in a wide variety of tumors through mutational activation of any of the Ras genes, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), PI3K, or loss of PTEN (3.Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). If GSK3 would indeed represent a focal point of cross-talk between the two pathways, β-catenin/TCF-driven transcription would be activated in tumors harboring PI3K-activating mutations. This has major implications for our thinking on the molecular pathogenesis of cancer. The final positions of the Q descendants was scored using a mec-7::gfp (muIs32) reporter transgene (11.Ch'ng Q.

Niehrs), mutated β-catenin (S33A) (kind gift from K. Kinzler), and Wnt1 and Wnt3a (both kind gifts from R. Nusse) were subjected to PCR amplification and then cloned into pcDNA4TO. HCC1937, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-468, SUM159, SUM185, UACC893, and LNCaP were transfected with FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science); BT483, BT549, MDA-MB-415, SK-BR-7, PC3, and 293T were transfected with polyethyleneimine (Polysciences); and ZR-75-1 was transfected with electroporation. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant (250 ng/well in 24-well plate for FuGENE HD or polyethyleneimine transfection and 1.1 μg/well in 6-well plates for electroporation) by the addition of an appropriate amount of empty expression vector, pCDNA4TO, and the ratio of reporter plasmid (TOP10 or FOP10) with internal control plasmid (pCMV-Renilla) was kept constant at 10:1. 16 h after TOPFlash transfection, the cells were treated with condition medium or inhibitors (wortmannin and Akt inhibitor IV and Akt inhibitor VIII were both from Sigma), and the measurements were performed 12–16 h later. All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated at least twice. The expression construct for human FLAG-tagged Axin1 was produced by PCR amplification of the coding region using the IMAGE clone ID 5809104 as a cDNA template, and this PCR product was cloned into pCDNA3. HEK293T cells were cultured to 80% confluence and starved at least 12 h before treatment with 10 mg/liter insulin (Invitrogen) for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h or with 200 nm wortmannin for 30 min, 1 h, and 4 h except control (0 min). Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture tablets (EDTA-free) (Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 (Sigma). A cycle of freeze-thawing was used for lysis. After clarification by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C), equal amounts of the total protein from each sample were incubated with anti-Axin1 antibody or mouse IgG immobilized on Protein G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. After washing the immune complexes with cold lysis buffer six times, they were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. Immunoblottings were done by reprobing the same blot after stripping (Pierce) using anti-phospho-GSK3β (S9) (Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-PKB (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling), anti-GSK3β (Cell Signaling), anti-PKB (Cell Signaling), and anti-Axin antibodies. FLAG-tagged mouse Axin2/Conductin was a gift from Jürgen Behrens, and FLAG-tagged human Axin2 was cloned from IMAGE clone ID4053244 to pCDNA4TO vector by PCR. Antibodies directed against Axin were produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with the N-terminal part (amino acid 3–326) of mouse Axin1. Hybridomas were generated using standard procedures. When we screened a large panel of breast cancer cell lines for constitutive β-catenin/TCF reporter (pTOPFlash) activity, the hallmark of active Wnt signaling, we found only a single positive cell line to be responsive to Wnt (12.van de Wetering M. Barker N. Harkes I.C. van der Heyden M. Dijk N.J. Hollestelle A. Klijn J.G. Clevers H. Schutte M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 278-284PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line, DU4475, turned out to carry a mutation in the Wnt pathway tumor suppressor APC, a mutation typically found almost exclusively in colon cancers. We have since determined the mutational status of the three RAS genes (KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS), the BRAF kinase gene, the PTEN gene, and PI3K (PIK3CA) in a much larger panel of breast cancer cell lines (13.Hollestelle A. Elstrodt F. Nagel J.H. Kallemeijn W.W. Schutte M. Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We conducted Tcf reporter assays for the entire breast cancer cell line panel. Moreover, we subjected two well defined prostate cancer cell lines, both of which harbor inactivating PTEN mutations (14.Vlietstra R.J. van Alewijk D.C. Hermans K.G. van Steenbrugge G.J. Trapman J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2720-2723PubMed Google Scholar). No TOPFlash activity was observed in any of the cell lines. LiCl is a well established inhibitor of GSK3 kinase activity and as such represents a pharmacological activator of the Wnt cascade at the level of GSK3 (15.Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nine of 13 cell lines subjected to LiCl treatment responded by a potent activation of the TOPFlash reporter, indicating the presence of an intact intracellular Wnt pathway. Table 1 displays the identities of the mutations present in the individual cell lines, the presence of a constitutively active or inactive Wnt pathway as measured in the TOPFlash assay, as well as the inducibility of the Wnt pathway by LiCl which was tested in a subset of the cell lines. The underlying TOPFlash values are given in Table S2. We next investigated the presence of a complete and functional Wnt pathway in the PTEN-mutant prostate cancer cell line PC3 and in the PTEN-mutant breast cancer cell line BT549 by transfection of Wnt1 or Wnt3A. Although modest responses were observed in the PC3 cells, the BT549 responded vigorously to the Wnt proteins (Fig. 1, A and B, top panels). We concluded that these two cell lines harbored fully functional Wnt pathways, which were not affected by the mutational status of the PI3K pathway but could readily be activated by Wnt proteins. To examine the effect of inhibition of the PI3K pathway on Wnt-induced transcriptional activity, we applied the pharmacological PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Western blot analysis of phospho-PKB and phospho-GSK3β confirmed efficient inhibition of the PI3K pathway in these cell lines in response to wortmannin treatment (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom panels). TOPFlash reporter assays revealed no effect of wortmannin on Non-Wnt-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, A and B, top panels) or on Wnt1 or Wnt3A-stimulated cells (Fig. 1, A and B, top panels). In an independent experiment, we applied the PKB inhibitors AKT inhibitor IV and VIII. Although these inhibitors readily blocked phosphorylation of PKB and GSK3β (supplemental Fig. 1), no statistically significant differences were noted on LiCl-stimulated TOPFlash reporter activity in BT549 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). We extended these results by examining the effect of PI3K pathway inhibition on Wnt-induced transcription in two other prostate and breast cancer cell lines, LNCaP and MDA-MB-468, respectively. Both cell lines were transcriptionally induced in response to β-catenin/TCF4 expression or LiCl treatment (Fig. 1, C and D, top panels). However, addition of PI3K pathway inhibitors wortmannin and AKT inhibitor IV, at concentrations that efficiently blocked PKB and GSK3 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, C and D, bottom panels), had no significant effect on LiCl or TCF4/β-catenin induced transcriptional activation. Comparison of differences between TOPFlash activities was performed using two-tailed Student's t test (where equal variance between groups was assumed). We further confirmed our observations in an in vivo system, the nematode C. elegans. In the nematode C. elegans, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates the left-right asymmetric migration of the Q descendants (16.Silhankova M. Korswagen H.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17.Korswagen H.C. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). On the left side, egl-20 triggers the expression of the Hox gene mab-5, which directs the migration of the Q descendants (QL.d) toward the posterior (18.Salser S.J. Kenyon C. Nature. 1992; 355: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). On the right side, mab-5 is not expressed, and as a result the QR descendants (QR.d) migrate in the default anterior direction. Mutations that disrupt Wnt/β-catenin signaling, such as mutations in mig-1/Fz, bar-1/β-catenin, or pop-1/Tcf, lead to loss of mab-5 expression in QL and anterior migration of the QL.d (17.Korswagen H.C. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19.Maloof J.N. Whangbo J. Harris J.M. Jongeward G.D. Kenyon C. Development. 1999; 126: 37-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Harris J. Honigberg L. Robinson N. Kenyon C. Development. 1996; 122: 3117-3131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, mutation of negative regulators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, such as pry-1/Axin, leads to ectopic expression of mab-5 in QR and posterior migration of the QR.d (19.Maloof J.N. Whangbo J. Harris J.M. Jongeward G.D. Kenyon C. Development. 1999; 126: 37-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Korswagen H.C. Coudreuse D.Y. Betist M.C. van de Water S. Zivkovic D. Clevers H.C. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The final positions of the Q descendants therefore provide a sensitive measure of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity. We investigated whether mutation of the C. elegans PTEN ortholog daf-18 (22.Ogg S. Ruvkun G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 887-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) affects Q descendant migration. The deletion allele daf-18(ok480) is expected to represent a strong loss of function or the null phenotype. We found that daf-18(ok480) has no effect on either QL.d or QR.d migration compared with wild type (Table 2; in each case, n = 50), indicating that loss of PTEN does not affect Wnt/β-catenin signaling in C. elegans.TABLE 2Knock-out of daf-18 in C. elegans has no effect on the Wnt/β-catenin pathwayGenotypeEffect on Q descendant migrationControl (muls32(mec-7::gfp))100% wild type, n = 50Daf-18(ok480); muls32,2100% wild type, n = 50Daf-18(ok480); muls32,13100% wild type, n = 50Daf-18(ok480); muls32,16100% wild type, n = 50 Open table in a new tab We then turned to a physiological model for insulin/PI3K signaling. HEK293T cells respond to insulin by activating PI3K, which phosphorylates and activates PKB/AKT (2.Cully M. You H. Levine A.J. Mak T.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 184-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), leading to inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9. As shown in Fig. 2, B and C, addition of insulin leads to a rapid phosphorylation of total cellular PKB and GSK3β (input, compare 1st 3 lanes). Inhibition of PI3K abolished PKB and GSK3β phosphorylation at 30 min (Fig. 2B, input, compare 1st with 4th lanes) and 1 and 4 h post-wortmannin treatment (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 1–3). To study a potential effect of PI3K/PKB pathway activation on Wnt/β-catenin target gene expression in HEK293T cells, we used the pTOPFlash Wnt reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 3, Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not influenced by PI3K/PKB pathway activation but could readily be blocked by the soluble Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 in HEK293T cells. Axin is believed to be the central scaffolding component in the cytoplasmic destruction complex of the Wnt cascade, as it carries independent interaction domains for the Wnt pathway components APC, GSK3, CK1, Dsh, and β-catenin (6.Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar, 7.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it is by far the least abundant core component of the Wnt pathway (23.Lee E. Salic A. Krüger R. Heinrich R. Kirschner M.W. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E10Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The pool of GSK3β that is dedicated to Wnt signaling is stably bound to Axin (6.Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar, 7.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To be able to investigate whether the endogenous Axin-bound pool of GSK3β was targeted by insulin-activated PKB, we generated monoclonal antibodies against Axin (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B (9th to 12th lanes) demonstrates the results obtained with immunoprecipitations of endogenous AXIN from the same lysates as used in input lanes. Endogenous GSK3β readily co-immunoprecipitated with AXIN (Fig. 2B, 9th to 12th lanes. This AXIN-GSK3 complex was robust, as it even resisted 3% Nonidet P-40/Triton X-100 (data not shown). From multiple experiments, we estimate that 3–5% of total cellular GSK3β resides within the AXIN complex. When the blots were probed with anti-phospho-GSK3β antibodies, the phosphorylation level was found to remain unchanged upon both insulin signaling (Fig. 2, B and C) and treatment with wortmannin (Fig. 2, B and D). Furthermore, (phospho-) PKB was not co-precipitated. We conclude that, although insulin rapidly activated the PI3K pathway as evidenced by sequential phosphorylation of PKB and GSK3β, the small AXIN-bound pool of GSK3β is protected from activated PKB. Thus, activation or inhibition of PI3K/PKB does not target the Axin-bound GSK3β pool. These results were further confirmed in PC3 prostate cancer cells, which have previously been used to implicate a role for PI3K signaling in the Wnt pathway (supplemental Fig. 3) (24.Persad S. Troussard A.A. McPhee T.R. Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This result supports the hypothesis that different pools of GSK3 kinases exist in cells, participating separately in the PI3K/PKB pathway or the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as originally proposed by Frame and Cohen (25.Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The existence of Axin-GSK3 complexes appears to serve two functions. First, the Axin complex allows GSK3 to target β-catenin specifically by providing docking sites for both proteins (6.Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar). Second, when GSK3 is complexed to Axin, it is shielded from activated PKB. This molecular arrangement allows Wnt and PI3K inputs to have independent effects on the biological outputs of the cells that receive these signals. These findings also help to clarify why mutations in canonical Wnt components (i.e. APC, Axin/conductin, or β-catenin) are mutually exclusive in colorectal cancer, although individual cases of colorectal cancer frequently combine an activating Wnt pathway mutation with a mutation in a component of the PI3K pathway (26.Sjöblom T.

Similar observations are made for ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma, for example (27.Wu R. Hendrix-Lucas N. Kuick R. Zhai Y. Schwartz D.R. Akyol A. Hanash S. Misek D.E. Katabuchi H. Williams B.O. Fearon E.R. Cho K.R. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 321-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). If activating PI3K pathway mutations would activate the Wnt pathway, such mutations should not occur in combination with activating Wnt pathway mutations in cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2027692436,"Background Mutations in LRRK2 gene represent the most common known genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methodology/Principal Findings We used metabolomic profiling to identify biomarkers that are associated with idiopathic and LRRK2 PD. We compared plasma metabolomic profiles of patients with PD due to the G2019S LRRK2 mutation, to asymptomatic family members of these patients either with or without G2019S LRRK2 mutations, and to patients with idiopathic PD, as well as non-related control subjects. We found that metabolomic profiles of both idiopathic PD and LRRK2 PD subjects were clearly separated from controls. LRRK2 PD patients had metabolomic profiles distinguishable from those with idiopathic PD, and the profiles could predict whether the PD was secondary to LRRK2 mutations or idiopathic. Metabolomic profiles of LRRK2 PD patients were well separated from their family members, but there was a slight overlap between family members with and without LRRK2 mutations. Both LRRK2 and idiopathic PD patients showed significantly reduced uric acid levels. We also found a significant decrease in levels of hypoxanthine and in the ratios of major metabolites of the purine pathway in plasma of PD patients. Conclusions/Significance These findings show that LRRK2 patients with the G2019S mutation have unique metabolomic profiles that distinguish them from patients with idiopathic PD. Furthermore, asymptomatic LRRK2 carriers can be separated from gene negative family members, which raises the possibility that metabolomic profiles could be useful in predicting which LRRK2 carriers will eventually develop PD. The results also suggest that there are aberrations in the purine pathway in PD which may occur upstream from uric acid."

https://openalex.org/W2031601225,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in several cell death processes, including cerebral ischemic injury. We found that glutamate-induced ROS accumulation and the associated cell death in mouse hippocampal cell lines were delayed by pharmacological inhibition of autophagy or lysosomal activity. Glutamate, however, did not stimulate autophagy, which was assessed by a protein marker, LC3, and neither changes in organization of mitochondria nor lysosomal membrane permeabilization were observed. Fluorescent analyses by a redox probe PF-H(2)TMRos revealed that autophagosomes and/or lysosomes are the major sites for basal ROS generation in addition to mitochondria. Treatments with inhibitors for autophagy and lysosomes decreased their basal ROS production and caused a burst of mitochondrial ROS to be delayed. On the other hand, attenuation of mitochondrial activity by serum depletion or by high cell density culture resulted in the loss of both constitutive ROS production and an ROS burst in mitochondria. Thus, constitutive ROS production within mitochondria and lysosomes enables cells to be susceptible to glutamate-induced oxidative cytotoxicity. Likewise, inhibitors for autophagy and lysosomes reduced neural cell death in an ischemia model in rats. We suggest that cell injury during periods of ischemia is regulated by ROS-generating activity in autophagosomes and/or lysosomes as well as in mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2081737697,"Factor H (FH) regulates the activation of C3b in the alternative complement pathway, both in serum and at host cell surfaces. It is composed of 20 short complement regulator (SCR) domains. The Y402H polymorphism in FH is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein that binds Ca(2+). We established the FH-CRP interaction using improved analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and synchrotron x-ray scattering methods. Physiological FH and CRP concentrations were used in 137 mM NaCl and 2 mM Ca(2+), in which the occurrence of denatured CRP was avoided. In solution, AUC revealed FH-CRP binding. The FH-CRP interaction inhibited the formation of higher FH oligomers, indicating that CRP blocked FH dimerization sites at both SCR-6/8 and SCR-16/20. SPR confirmed the FH-CRP interaction and its NaCl concentration dependence upon using either immobilized FH or CRP. The SCR-1/5 fragment of FH did not bind to CRP. In order of increasing affinity, SCR-16/20, SCR-6/8 (His-402), and SCR-6/8 (Tyr-402) fragments bound to CRP. X-ray scattering showed that FH became more compact when binding to CRP, which is consistent with CRP binding at two different FH sites. We concluded that FH and CRP bind at elevated acute phase concentrations of CRP in physiological buffer. The SCR-16/20 site is novel and indicates the importance of the FH-CRP interaction for both age-related macular degeneration and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2101771613,"Ectopic expression of defined sets of genetic factors can reprogram somatic cells to create induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. The capacity to direct human iPS cells to specific differentiated lineages and to their progenitor populations can be used for disease modeling, drug discovery, and eventually autologous cell replacement therapies. During mouse cardiogenesis, the major lineages of the mature heart, cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells arise from a common, multipotent cardiovascular progenitor expressing the transcription factors Isl1 and Nkx2.5. Here we show, using genetic fate-mapping, that Isl1(+) multipotent cardiovascular progenitors can be generated from mouse iPS cells and spontaneously differentiate in all 3 cardiovascular lineages in vivo without teratoma. Moreover, we report the identification of human iPS-derived ISL1(+) progenitors with similar developmental potential. These results support the possibility to use patient-specific iPS-generated cardiovascular progenitors as a model to elucidate the pathogenesis of congenital and acquired forms of heart diseases.-Moretti, A., Bellin, M., Jung, C.

https://openalex.org/W2168013023,"Aminopyridines such as 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) are widely used as voltage-activated K(+) (Kv) channel blockers and can improve neuromuscular function in patients with spinal cord injury, myasthenia gravis, or multiple sclerosis. Here, we present novel evidence that 4-AP and several of its analogs directly stimulate high voltage-activated Ca(2+) channels (HVACCs) in acutely dissociated neurons. 4-AP, 4-(aminomethyl)pyridine, 4-(methylamino)pyridine, and 4-di(methylamino)pyridine profoundly increased HVACC, but not T-type, currents in dissociated neurons from the rat dorsal root ganglion, superior cervical ganglion, and hippocampus. The widely used Kv channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium, alpha-dendrotoxin, phrixotoxin-2, and BDS-I, did not mimic or alter the effect of 4-AP on HVACCs. In HEK293 cells expressing various combinations of N-type (Cav2.2) channel subunits, 4-AP potentiated Ca(2+) currents primarily through the intracellular beta(3) subunit. In contrast, 4-AP had no effect on Cav3.2 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, blocking Kv channels did not mimic or change the potentiating effects of 4-AP on neurotransmitter release from sensory and motor nerve terminals. Thus, our findings challenge the conventional view that 4-AP facilitates synaptic and neuromuscular transmission by blocking Kv channels. Aminopyridines can directly target presynaptic HVACCs to potentiate neurotransmitter release independent of Kv channels."
https://openalex.org/W1988293824,"Inflammatory stimulants such as bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) are known to induce tissue damage and injury partly through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although it is recognized that the induction of ROS in macrophages by LPS depends upon the expression and activation of NADPH oxidase, as well as the suppression of antioxidative enzymes involved in ROS clearance, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly defined. In this study, we examined the contribution of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) to LPS-induced generation of ROS. We observed that LPS induced significantly less ROS in IRAK-1−/− macrophages, indicating that IRAK-1 is critically involved in the induction of ROS. Mechanistically, we observed that IRAK-1 is required for LPS-induced expression of NOX-1, a key component of NADPH oxidase, via multiple transcription factors, including p65/RelA, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ. On the other hand, we demonstrated that IRAK-1 associated with and activated small GTPase Rac1, a known activator of NOX-1 oxidase enzymatic activity.

On the other hand, we also observed that IRAK-1 is required for LPS-mediated suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and PGC-1α, nuclear factors essential for the expression of antioxidative enzymes such as GPX3 and catalase.

The generation of ROS is modulated by two families of opposing enzymes, oxidative enzymes such as NADPH oxidase and antioxidative enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. Bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) selectively induce the expression and activation of oxidative enzymes, while decreasing the expression of antioxidative enzymes (1.Wiesel P.

Most of the published studies regarding NADPH oxidase have been specifically focused on the regulation and activation of NOX-2, the enzymatic NADPH oxidase component primarily expressed in neutrophils (3.Singh A. Zarember K.A. Kuhns D.B. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6410-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4.Raad H. Paclet M.H. Boussetta T. Kroviarski Y. Morel F. Quinn M.T. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Dang P.M. El-Benna J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). NOX-2 protein is constitutively expressed and is not regulated transcriptionally (3.Singh A. Zarember K.A. Kuhns D.B. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6410-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). LPS challenge causes rapid translocation of the functional NOX-2 containing NADPH oxidase to the membrane complex, leading to its activation (3.Singh A. Zarember K.A. Kuhns D.B. Gallin J.I. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6410-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, NOX-1, the primary NADPH oxidase in macrophages, can be both transcriptionally induced and post-transcriptionally activated by LPS. However, the molecular mechanism for LPS-induced expression and activation of NOX-1 is poorly defined. Based on studies done in other cell types (5.Qin L. Li G. Qian X. Liu Y. Wu X. Liu B. Hong J.S. Block M.L. Glia. 2005; 52: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6.Chéret C. Gervais A. Lelli A. Colin C. Amar L. Ravassard P. Mallet J. Cumano A. Krause K.H. Mallat M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12039-12051Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that LPS may contribute to the activation of NOX-1 containing NADPH oxidase via the small GTPase Rac1 in macrophages (7.Bokoch G.M. Zhao T. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 1533-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying LPS-mediated activation of Rac1 in macrophages is not known. On the other hand, LPS treatment decreases the levels of nuclear receptor family transcription factors such as PPARα and PGC-1, which are responsible for the sustained expression of antioxidative enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and catalase (8.Feingold K.R.

Collectively, the LPS-triggered up-regulation of oxidative enzymes and concurrent down-regulation of antioxidases leads to the generation and accumulation of ROS and tissue damage. IRAK-1 is one of many intracellular signaling components downstream of the LPS receptor (TLR4) (12.Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6669) Google Scholar, 13.O'Neill L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 14.Li L. Curr.

A series of studies have revealed that IRAK-1 positively contributes to the activation of NFκB, STAT1/3, and IRF5/7, while negatively regulating the activities of nuclear factor of activated T-cells and nuclear receptors (15.Uematsu S.

Despite the prominent role that IRAK-1 plays within the TLR4 signaling pathway, its involvement in LPS-mediated ROS production in macrophages has never been defined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that IRAK-1 may activate the transcription of NOX-1 via NFκB and other related transcription factors and suppress the transcription of antioxidative enzymes through nuclear receptors. Furthermore, we tested whether IRAK-1 may facilitate LPS-mediated activation of the small GTPase Rac1, a key factor involved in the activation of NOX-1-containing NADPH oxidase. The generation of ROS following LPS challenge was measured both in vivo and in vitro using wild type (WT) and IRAK-1−/− mice and cells. LPS (Escherichia coli O111:B4) was obtained from Sigma. The antibodies against catalase, Nox-1, PPARα, PGC1α, C/EBPδ, C/EBPβ, LaminB, and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The primer sets were obtained from IDT. The primer sequences are as follows: Nox-1(+), 5′-TCCATTTCCTTCCTGGAGTGGCAT-3′, and Nox-1(−), 5′-GGCATTGGTGAGTGCTGTTGTTCA-3′; Gpx3(+), 5′-GCCAGCTACTGAGGTCTGACAGA-3′, and Gpx3(−), 5′-CAAATGGCCCAAGTTCTTCTTG-3′; catalase(+), 5′-TTCAGAAGAAAGCGGTCAAGAAT-3′, catalase(−), 5′-GATGCGGGCCCCATAGTC-3′; and Gapdh(+), 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGGGCTC-3′, and Gapdh(−), 5′-TGGAAGAGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTGA-3′. Wild type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Charles River Laboratories. IRAK1−/− mice with C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Dr. James Thomas from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. All mice were housed and bred at Derring Hall Animal Facility in compliance with approved Animal Care and Use Committee protocols at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were harvested and cultured as we have described previously (21.Wang D. Fasciano S. Li L. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 3902-3908Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Isolation of whole cell lysates was performed as described earlier (18.Huang Y. Li T. Sane D.C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51697-51703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated or treated BMDMs and MEFs were rinsed in PBS and then lysed on ice in 1× SDS lysis buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 50% glycerol) containing protease inhibitor mixture. Western blot analysis of the protein samples was performed as described previously. Immunoblots were developed by using the Amersham Biosciences ECL Plus chemiluminescent detection system (GE Healthcare). The intensities of the bands were quantified using the Fujifilm MultiGauge software and then normalized against β-actin levels. Total RNA was extracted from untreated or treated BMDM and MEF cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Similar protocol was followed to isolate total RNA from small pieces of mouse liver and kidney tissues (50–100 μg) using TRIzol. Reverse transcription was carried out using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems), and subsequent real time RT-PCR analyses were performed using the SYBR green supermix on an IQ5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad). The relative levels of transcripts were calculated using the ΔΔCt method after normalizing with Gapdh as the internal control. To monitor the net intracellular accumulation of ROS, the fluorescent probe chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used. WT and IRAK1−/− BMDM cells (5 × 105 cells/well on 12-well plates) were treated with LPS 10 ng/ml overnight in phenol-free medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and then rinsed with PBS containing calcium and magnesium followed by addition of 10 μm chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove any extracellular dye. The formation of fluorescent product, dichlorofluorescein, was analyzed using a fluorescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelength of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. DCFDA undergoes deacetylation and reacts quantitatively with intracellular radicals (mainly H2O2) and is converted to its fluorescent product, dichlorofluorescein, which is retained within the cells and thus provides an index of cell cytosolic oxidation. The extent of lipid peroxidation in plasma was determined by commercially available colorimetric assay kit BIOXYTECH® LPO-586 (OXIS Research, Portland, OR). Plasma samples were collected from WT and IRAK1−/− mice 16 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Samples were then diluted with 3.25 volumes of diluted R1 reagent (10.3 mm N-methyl-2-phenylindole in acetonitrile) and mixed by gentle vortexing. After addition of 75 μl of 37% (v/v) HCl, the mixtures were incubated at 45 °C for 60 min, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The absorbance of the clear supernatant was analyzed at 586 nm. The activity of Rac1 was measured by the affinity precipitation assay based on the specific interaction of activated Rac with its downstream effectors using the Active Rac1 detection kit (Thermo Scientific). For the Rac activity assay, BMDM cells were lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). GST-p21-activated protein kinase binding domain beads were used for affinity precipitation assays, and the activated Rac was detected by immunoblotting using an anti-Rac1 antibody. MAT4 cells (HeLa cells stably transfected with TLR4 and MD2) were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as described previously (22.Su J. Xie Q. Wilson I. Li L. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1596-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the wild type pFLAG-IRAK-1 plasmid, the N-terminal deletion pFLAG-IRAK-1-ΔN plasmid, the C-terminal deletion pFLAG-IRAK-1ΔC plasmids, or the pFLAG-IRAK-1 mutant plasmids (L167A/W168A) as described previously (23.Hu J. Jacinto R. McCall C. Li L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3910-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours after the transfection, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 5 min. Total cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 100× protease inhibitors, and 800 μg of cell lysate was used to perform immunoprecipitation with an anti-Rac1 antibody or an isotype control antibody from the same company (Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitates were separated on SDS-PAGE and probed for the presence of various IRAK-1 forms and Rac1 using specific antibodies as described in the figure legends. GPX activity in LPS-treated MEF and BMDM cells was assessed using a commercially available colorimetric kit (Cayman Chemical), which measures GPX3 activity indirectly by a coupled reaction with glutathione reductase. 170 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 μl of cell lysates from BMDM or MEF cells, 100 μl of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm EDTA), and 50 μl of co-substrate (5.0 mm GSH, 0.1 mm NADPH, 0.1 unit of glutathione reductase) was added in a 96-well plate. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of 0.2 mm cumene hydroperoxide. The oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ leading to a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded at 1-min intervals for 5 min. The rate of decrease in the absorbance is directly proportional to the GPX activity in the sample. The enzyme activity was expressed as nanomoles of NADPH oxidized per min/ml/mg protein. The catalase activity in BMDM cells was determined using a commercially available colorimetric kit (Cayman Chemical) based on the peroxidation function of catalase for determination of enzyme activity. The amount of formaldehyde produced was measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm with the assistance of Purpald®, a chromogen that generates a purple color upon reaction with an aldehyde. WT and IRAK1−/− BMDM cells were either untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml for 2 h followed by cross-linking with 1% formaldehyde in complete media for 15 min with gentle rocking at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and treated with glycine solution for 5 min to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were then lysed in buffer containing SDS and protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were sonicated six times with 30-s pulses at 4 °C followed by centrifugation to collect the sheared chromatin. The sheared chromatin was used to set up immunoprecipitation reactions with the indicated antibodies using the CHIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The immunoprecipitated DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR using the primers spanning the binding sites of the specified transcription factors on the murine Nox-1 promoter. For siRNA interference, WT BMDM cells (2 × 106 cells) were plated in 6-well plates and transfected the following day by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the indicated siRNA oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After 36 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time points followed by DCFDA staining. Whole cell extracts were prepared for Western blot analysis using the specified antibodies. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The log-rank test was performed to evaluate the statistical significance of the mice mortality. To determine whether IRAK-1 is involved in LPS-induced production of ROS, we measured the intracellular levels of ROS induced by LPS in BMDMs harvested from WT and IRAK-1−/− mice. Following LPS treatment, the cells were stained with the ROS-selective fluorescent dye DCFDA. The fluorescent intensities reflecting the levels of intracellular ROS were measured with a fluorescent plate reader. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, LPS treatments induced a significant increase in ROS production in WT BMDM (20% increase after 15 min of treatment; 60% increase after 16 h of treatment). In contrast, there was no significant induction of ROS following either LPS treatment in IRAK-1−/− BMDM. To further confirm the specificity and involvement of IRAK-1 in LPS-induced ROS expression, we performed siRNA experiments to knock down the expression of IRAK-1 in WT BMDMs. As shown in Fig. 1C, IRAK-1-specific siRNA results in significant knockdown of IRAK-1 protein expression as compared with the control siRNA (lower panel). The transfected cells were either untreated or treated with LPS for 15 min followed by the measurement of intracellular ROS levels. Consistent with the previous data using IRAK1−/− BMDMs, LPS treatment failed to induce ROS levels in IRAK-1 siRNA-transfected cells as compared with the control siRNA (Fig. 1C). LPS is known to induce the expression of NOX-1, although the underlying mechanism is not well understood (24.Qin L. Liu Y. Wang T. Wei S.J. Block M.L. Wilson B. Liu B. Hong J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1415-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The induction of NOX-1 contributes to the generation of ROS following LPS treatment. Because our study indicates that IRAK-1 deficiency ablates the induction of ROS following LPS treatments, we tested the hypothesis that IRAK-1 may be required for LPS-induced expression of NOX-1. WT and IRAK-1−/− BMDM were stimulated with LPS for 2 h. Total RNAs were harvested and used to measure the levels of Nox-1 messages by real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2A, the induction of Nox-1 by LPS was significantly lower in IRAK-1−/− BMDM (3-fold induction in IRAK-1−/− BMDM compared with 6-fold induction in WT BMDM). Similarly, the protein levels of NOX-1 were significantly higher in WT as compared with IRAK-1−/− BMDMs in response to LPS (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the levels of Nox-2 remain constant with or without LPS challenge in WT or IRAK-1 cells (data not shown). Although the transcriptional mechanism for NOX-1 expression is not known, previous studies have identified putative C/EBP-binding sites within the proximal promoter of Nox-1 (25.Adachi Y. Shibai Y. Mitsushita J. Shang W.H. Hirose K. Kamata T. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 4921-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the status of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ in WT and IRAK-1−/− macrophages. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS treatment led to a significant induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ levels in the nuclear lysates from WT cells. Strikingly, LPS-mediated C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ induction was significantly impaired in IRAK1−/− cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we examined the in vivo binding of C/EBPδ to the proximal promoter of Nox-1 in WT and IRAK-1−/− BMDMs using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. As shown in Fig. 3C, there was no basal interaction of C/EBPδ with Nox-1 promoter. LPS treatment led to a significant recruitment of C/EBPδ to the endogenous Nox-1 promoter in WT BMDMs. In contrast, the binding of C/EBPδ to the Nox-1 promoter in response to LPS treatment in IRAK-1−/− BMDMs was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3C). It is increasingly recognized that cooperation among multiple transcription factors is required for inducible gene expression. Besides the C/EBP-binding site, we also observed a putative binding site for NFκB within the Nox-1 proximal promoter region (Fig. 3B). We subsequently examined whether LPS may induce the association of p65/RelA to the Nox-1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 3C, LPS induced a significant recruitment of p65/RelA to the Nox-1 promoter in WT BMDM but not in IRAK-1−/− BMDMs. Our data revealed that LPS induces a combinatorial effect of multiple transcription factors in the regulation of Nox-1 expression. Once the NOX-1 protein is expressed, its enzymatic activity can be activated by LPS through the small GTPase Rac1 (26.Cheng G. Diebold B.A. Hughes Y. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17718-17726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 27.Kawahara T. Kohjima M. Kuwano Y. Mino H. Teshima-Kondo S. Takeya R. Tsunawaki S. Wada A. Sumimoto H. Rokutan K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C450-C457Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, we further tested whether IRAK-1 also participates in LPS-induced activation of Rac1. Using the Rac1 activation assay, we observed that LPS treatment for 5 min resulted in significant activation of Rac1 in WT but not in IRAK-1−/− BMDM (Fig. 4, A and B). To examine the molecular mechanism for the IRAK-1-mediated activation of Rac1, we examined whether IRAK-1 and Rac1 may form a close complex following LPS treatment. WT BMDM cells were stimulated with LPS for 5 min, and IRAK-1-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with IRAK-1-specific antibody (Upstate, Millipore). An isotype-matched control antibody from the same company was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 5A, LPS treatment induced dramatic co-immunoprecipitation of IRAK-1 and Rac1. We further studied the protein domain(s) required for the interaction between IRAK-1 and Rac1. FLAG-tagged WT and mutant IRAK-1 plasmids were transiently transfected into MAT4 cells (HeLa cells stably transfected with TLR4 and MD2) (Fig. 5B). Transfected cells were treated with LPS for 5 min. Co-immunoprecipitation analyses were performed using the anti-FLAG antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An isotype-matched control antibody purchased from the same company was used as a negative control. The resulting immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blotted with either the anti-FLAG antibody (detecting various IRAK-1 forms) or the anti-Rac1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5C, LPS treatment led to co-immunoprecipitation of Rac1 with the full-length FLAG-IRAK-1 and the FLAG-IRAK-1ΔC. Particularly, Rac1 interacted strongly with the FLAG-IRAK-1ΔC mutant, suggesting that the C terminus may inhibit the interaction of Rac1 and the full-length IRAK-1. On the other hand, we observed that the FLAG-IRAK-1ΔN failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Rac1. Therefore, our data indicate that the N-terminal region of IRAK-1 molecule is required to interact with Rac1. We further noticed that the IRAK-1 N terminus contains a novel LWPPPP motif. Interestingly, similar L(W/F/Y)PPPP motifs are present in proteins involved in cytoskeletal re-arrangement that recruit small GTPases such as CDC42 and Rac1. Intriguingly, we found that the FLAG-IRAK-1(L167A/W168A) mutant also failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Rac1 (Fig. 5C). The levels of intracellular ROS are not only regulated by the activities and levels of NADPH oxidase but also by the levels of antioxidases. LPS is known to suppress the expression of antioxidases such as GPX and catalase through suppressing nuclear receptor-mediated gene transcription (8.Feingold K.R. Wang Y. Moser A. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2179-2187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Because IRAK-1 participates in LPS-mediated suppression of nuclear receptor (20.Maitra U. Parks J.S. Li L. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2009; 29: 5989-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we tested whether IRAK-1 may also contribute to the suppression of antioxidases by LPS. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, LPS treatment led to a significant reduction of both GPX3 and catalase in WT BMDM (∼60% reduction for both GPX3 and catalase). In contrast, their expression levels were not significantly altered by LPS treatment in IRAK-1−/− BMDM. To test whether the reduced expression correlates with the actual activities of GPX3 and catalase, we performed activity assays as shown in Fig. 6C. LPS treatment led to a significant decrease in the activities of both GPX and catalase in WT but not IRAK-1−/− BMDMs. LPS is known to reduce the levels of nuclear receptors such as PPARα and co-activators like PGC-1α (8.Feingold K.R. Wang Y. Moser A. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2179-2187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which are involved in the transcription of GPX and catalase (9.Chung S.S. Kim M. Youn B.S. Lee N.S. Park J.W. Lee I.K. Lee Y.S. Kim J.B. Cho Y.M. Lee H.K. Park K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11.Girnun G.D. Domann F.E. Moore S.A. Robbins M.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2793-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We then tested whether IRAK-1 participates in LPS-mediated suppression of PPARα and PGC-1α. As shown in Fig. 7, LPS treatment led to a 70% reduction of PPARα and a 50% reduction of PGC-1α in WT BMDM. In contrast, their levels remained unchanged following similar LPS treatment in IRAK-1−/− BMDM. We subsequently tested the in vivo consequence of IRAK-1 gene deletion using WT and IRAK-1−/− mice. To determine whether IRAK-1 contributes to LPS-induced mortality via elevated generation of ROS and oxidative damage, we examined the plasma levels of lipid peroxidation from WT and IRAK-1−/− mice injected with LPS. As shown in Fig. 8, 16 h after the LPS injection, there was a significant increase in plasma lipid peroxidation in WT mice but not in IRAK-1−/− mice. In this study, we have defined the molecular mechanism underlying the complex regulation of LPS-induced ROS generation in macrophages. We identified that IRAK-1 is critically involved in this process by inducing both the expression and activation of NOX-1 and suppressing the expression of antioxidative enzymes, GPX3 and catalase. Collectively, IRAK-1−/− cells and mice exhibit reduced ROS production following LPS challenge. Our data provide first-hand evidence revealing the molecular mechanism responsible for the transcriptional regulation of Nox-1 by LPS in macrophages. In particular, we demonstrate that multiple transcription factors, including p65 and C/EBPβ/δ, are coordinately involved in the LPS-induced transcription of Nox-1. Historically, p65/NFκB is the most extensively studied transcription factor downstream of TLR4. However, it has been increasingly recognized that p65/NFκB alone is usually not sufficient for effective transcription of selected target genes. Instead, cooperation among multiple transcription factors, co-activators, and/or co-repressors is essential for precise control of gene transcription (28.Pietilä T.E. Veckman V. Lehtonen A. Lin R. Hiscott J. Julkunen I. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29.Lu Y.C. Kim I. Lye E. Shen F. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Gerondakis S. Akira S. Gaffen S.L. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P.S. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 7212-7221Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our study also confirms a recent report demonstrating that the TLR4 pathway leads to the activation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ and indicates that IRAK-1 is necessary for LPS-induced activation of C/EBPβ/δ. Further work is warranted to clarify how p65 and C/EBPs cooperate in inducing the ordered transcription of Nox-1 by LPS in macrophages. Besides transcriptional regulation, our study indicates that IRAK-1 also facilitates the activation of NOX-1 through activating the small GTPase Rac1 (Fig. 9). Rac1 is a well known activator for the NOX-1 enzyme, and LPS is known to induce Rac1 activation (27.Kawahara T. Kohjima M. Kuwano Y. Mino H. Teshima-Kondo S. Takeya R. Tsunawaki S. Wada A. Sumimoto H. Rokutan K. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: C450-C457Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using transfection assays and dominant negative constructs, O'Neill and co-workers (30.Jefferies C. Bowie A. Brady G. Cooke E.L. Li X. O'Neill L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4544-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) initially reported that dominant negative IRAK-1 antagonizes the function of Rac1. This study confirms and expands upon that finding and provides the first biochemical evidence indicating that IRAK-1 physically associates with Rac1 upon LPS challenge and is upstream of Rac1 activation. Furthermore, our data confirm that the novel N-terminal LWPPPP motif of IRAK-1 is required for its interaction with Rac1. The surrounding region near the LWPPPP of IRAK-1 has been shown to be highly phosphorylated following LPS treatment (31.Cooke E.L. Uings I.J. Xia C.L. Woo P. Ray K.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32.Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, its functional implication is still poorly understood. Our study indicates that LPS-induced IRAK-1 phosphorylation near its LWPPPP motif may be required for the subsequent recruitment and activation of Rac1 in macrophages. In addition, our data reveal enhanced interaction between Rac1 and IRAK-1ΔC suggesting that the C terminus of IRAK-1 may negatively regulate its interaction with Rac1. Intriguingly, our data also demonstrate that IRAK-1 further contributes to LPS-induced ROS formation by suppressing the expression of antioxidases such as GPX3 and catalase. IRAK-1 suppresses their expression by decreasing the levels of nuclear receptors such as PPARα and PGC-1α (8.Feingold K.R. Wang Y. Moser A. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 2179-2187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism underlying IRAK-1-mediated suppression of these nuclear receptors is not clear yet, it is interesting to note that IRAK-1 is distributed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (18.Huang Y. Li T. Sane D.C. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51697-51703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33.Böl G. Kreuzer O.J. Brigelius-Flohé R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, IRAK-1 can interact with Tollip, a molecule implicated in protein ubiquitination, sumoylation, and trafficking (34.Neumann D. Kollewe C. Resch K. Martin M.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35.Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat.

Ambrosetti D. Melli M. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is therefore plausible that IRAK-1, together with Tollip, may selectively regulate the protein stability and/or trafficking of nuclear receptors such as PPAR and PGC-1 following LPS treatment. Future biochemical studies are warranted to test such hypothesis. Collectively, our study reveals the potential mechanism underlying the beneficial effects observed in animal models with IRAK-1 gene deletion (14.Li L. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm.

This study further revealed that the IRAK-1-deficient mice undergo significantly less plasma lipid peroxidation following lethal LPS injection. Our data provide compelling evidence indicating that IRAK-1 is not only a key mediator for LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines but also regulates the generation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative damages. Taken together, we postulate that IRAK-1 can serve as a viable target for future intervention of inflammatory diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2053850578,"The presence of full-length complements of viral genomic RNA is a hallmark of RNA virus replication within an infected cell. As such, methods for detecting and measuring specific strands of viral RNA in infected cells and tissues are important in the study of RNA viruses. Strand-specific quantitative real-time PCR (ssqPCR) assays are increasingly being used for this purpose, but the accuracy of these assays depends on the assumption that the amount of cDNA measured during the quantitative PCR (qPCR) step accurately reflects amounts of a specific viral RNA strand present in the RT reaction. To specifically test this assumption, we developed multiple ssqPCR assays for the positive-strand RNA virus o'nyong-nyong (ONNV) that were based upon the most prevalent ssqPCR assay design types in the literature. We then compared various parameters of the ONNV-specific assays. We found that an assay employing standard unmodified virus-specific primers failed to discern the difference between cDNAs generated from virus specific primers and those generated through false priming. Further, we were unable to accurately measure levels of ONNV (-) strand RNA with this assay when higher levels of cDNA generated from the (+) strand were present. Taken together, these results suggest that assays of this type do not accurately quantify levels of the anti-genomic strand present during RNA virus infectious cycles. However, an assay permitting the use of a tag-specific primer was able to distinguish cDNAs transcribed from ONNV (-) strand RNA from other cDNAs present, thus allowing accurate quantification of the anti-genomic strand. We also report the sensitivities of two different detection strategies and chemistries, SYBR(R) Green and DNA hydrolysis probes, used with our tagged ONNV-specific ssqPCR assays. Finally, we describe development, design and validation of ssqPCR assays for chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the recent cause of large outbreaks of disease in the Indian Ocean region."
https://openalex.org/W1980189947,"Background Fluorescence microscopy is the standard tool for detection and analysis of cellular phenomena. This technique, however, has a number of drawbacks such as the limited number of available fluorescent channels in microscopes, overlapping excitation and emission spectra of the stains, and phototoxicity. Methodology We here present and validate a method to automatically detect cell population outlines directly from bright field images. By imaging samples with several focus levels forming a bright field -stack, and by measuring the intensity variations of this stack over the -dimension, we construct a new two dimensional projection image of increased contrast. With additional information for locations of each cell, such as stained nuclei, this bright field projection image can be used instead of whole cell fluorescence to locate borders of individual cells, separating touching cells, and enabling single cell analysis. Using the popular CellProfiler freeware cell image analysis software mainly targeted for fluorescence microscopy, we validate our method by automatically segmenting low contrast and rather complex shaped murine macrophage cells. Significance The proposed approach frees up a fluorescence channel, which can be used for subcellular studies. It also facilitates cell shape measurement in experiments where whole cell fluorescent staining is either not available, or is dependent on a particular experimental condition. We show that whole cell area detection results using our projected bright field images match closely to the standard approach where cell areas are localized using fluorescence, and conclude that the high contrast bright field projection image can directly replace one fluorescent channel in whole cell quantification. Matlab code for calculating the projections can be downloaded from the supplementary site: http://sites.google.com/site/brightfieldorstaining"
https://openalex.org/W2090084341,"TNF alpha blockade agents like infliximab are actually the treatment of choice for those rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who fail standard therapy. However, a considerable percentage of anti-TNF alpha treated patients do not show a significant clinical response. Given that new therapies for treatment of RA have been recently approved, there is a pressing need to find a system that reliably predicts treatment response. We hypothesized that the analysis of whole blood gene expression profiles of RA patients could be used to build a robust predictor to infliximab therapy.We performed microarray gene expression analysis on whole blood RNA samples from RA patients starting infliximab therapy (n = 44). The clinical response to infliximab was determined at week 14 using the EULAR criteria. Blood cell populations were determined using flow cytometry at baseline, week 2 and week 14 of treatment. Using complete cross-validation and repeated random sampling we identified a robust 8-gene predictor model (96.6% Leave One Out prediction accuracy, P = 0.0001). Applying this model to an independent validation set of RA patients, we estimated an 85.7% prediction accuracy (75-100%, 95% CI). In parallel, we also observed a significantly higher number of CD4+CD25+ cells (i.e. regulatory T cells) in the responder group compared to the non responder group at baseline (P = 0.0009).The present 8-gene model obtained from whole blood expression efficiently predicts response to infliximab in RA patients. The application of the present system in the clinical setting could assist the clinician in the selection of the optimal treatment strategy in RA."
https://openalex.org/W2055975107,"Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in many biological processes, such as platelet biology, angiogenesis and in the aetiopathology of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of the most important receptors of the innate immune system. Their main function is the recognition of conserved structure of microorganisms. This recognition triggers signaling pathways that activate transcription of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules which participate in the generation of an immune response against microbes. In particular, TLR2 has been shown to recognize a broad range of ligands. Recently, we showed that CD36 serves as a co-receptor for TLR2 and enhances recognition of specific diacylglycerides derived from bacteria.Here, we investigate the mechanism by which CD36 contributes to ligand recognition and activation of TLR2 signaling pathway. We show that the ectodomain of murine CD36 (mCD36ED) directly interacts with negatively charged diacylglycerol ligands, which explains the specificity and selectivity of CD36 as a TLR2 co-receptor. We also show that mCD36ED amplifies the pro-inflammatory response to lipoteichoic acid in macrophages of wild-type mice and restores the pro-inflammatory response of macrophages from mice deficient in CD36 (oblivious), but not from mice deficient in cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) (heedless). CONCLUSION/ SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that the CD36 ectodomain is the only relevant domain for activation of TLR2 signaling pathway and that CD36 and CD14 have a non-redundant role for loading ligands onto TLR2 in the plasma-membrane. The pro-inflammatory role of soluble CD36 can be relevant in the activation of the immune response against pathogens, as well as in the progression of chronic diseases. Therefore, an increased level of soluble forms of CD36, which has been reported to be increased in type II diabetic patients, could accelerate atherosclerosis by increasing the pro-inflammatory response to diacylglycerol ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2078030982,"Northern-blot hybridization and low-scale sequencing have revealed that plants infected by viroids, non-protein-coding RNA replicons, accumulate 21–24 nt viroid-derived small RNAs (vd-sRNAs) similar to the small interfering RNAs, the hallmarks of RNA silencing. These results strongly support that viroids are elicitors and targets of the RNA silencing machinery of their hosts. Low-scale sequencing, however, retrieves partial datasets and may lead to biased interpretations. To overcome this restraint we have examined by deep sequencing (Solexa-Illumina) and computational approaches the vd-sRNAs accumulating in GF-305 peach seedlings infected by two molecular variants of Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) inciting peach calico (albinism) and peach mosaic. Our results show in both samples multiple PLMVd-sRNAs, with prevalent 21-nt (+) and (−) RNAs presenting a biased distribution of their 5′ nucleotide, and adopting a hotspot profile along the genomic (+) and (−) RNAs. Dicer-like 4 and 2 (DCL4 and DCL2, respectively), which act hierarchically in antiviral defense, likely also mediate the genesis of the 21- and 22-nt PLMVd-sRNAs. More specifically, because PLMVd replicates in plastids wherein RNA silencing has not been reported, DCL4 and DCL2 should dice the PLMVd genomic RNAs during their cytoplasmic movement or the PLMVd-dsRNAs generated by a cytoplasmic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), like RDR6, acting in concert with DCL4 processing. Furthermore, given that vd-sRNAs derived from the 12–14-nt insertion containing the pathogenicity determinant of peach calico are underrepresented, it is unlikely that symptoms may result from the accidental targeting of host mRNAs by vd-sRNAs from this determinant guiding the RNA silencing machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1971184412,"There is functional evidence that polycystin-2 (TRPP2) interacts with other members of the transient receptor potential family, including TRPC1 and TRPV4.

The molecular volumes of both Myc-tagged TRPP2 and V5-tagged TRPC1 isolated from singly transfected tsA 201 cells indicated that they assembled as homotetramers. The molecular volume of the protein isolated from cells expressing both TRPP2 and TRPC1 was intermediate between the volumes of the two homomers, suggesting that a heteromer was being formed. The distribution of angles between pairs of anti-Myc antibodies bound to TRPP2 particles had a large peak close to 90° and a smaller peak close to 180°, consistent with the assembly of TRPP2 as a homotetramer. In contrast, the corresponding angle distributions for decoration of the TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer by either anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibodies had predominant peaks close to 180°.

Intriguingly, data have recently been presented indicating that TRPP2 exists in the plasma membrane as a trimer, which is then able to interact with polycystin-1 to form a heteromer with a 3:1 stoichiometry (19.Yu Y. Ulbrich M.H. Li M.H. Buraei Z. Chen X.Z. Ong A.C. Tong L. Isacoff E.Y. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11558-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). It is puzzling that TRPP2 appears to behave differently from all other TRP channels, and the stoichiometry of the TRPP2 homomer must be regarded as controversial. The structure of the TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer has also recently been examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (20.Zhang P. Luo Y. Chasan B. González-Perrett S. Montalbetti N. Timpanaro G.A.

However, the images presented had some unusual features; for instance, the molecular volumes of the proteins were much larger than expected. It is fair to say, therefore, that the molecular architecture of this protein complex is also still unclear. We have developed a method, based on AFM imaging, for determining the arrangement of subunits within multimeric proteins (13.Barrera N.P. Shaifta Y. McFadzean I. Ward J.P. Henderson R.M.

This method involves engineering specific epitope tags, including His6, onto each subunit and expressing the proteins in a suitable cell line (e.g. tsA 201). Crude membrane fractions from the transfected cells are solubilized in detergent, and the proteins are isolated through binding to Ni2+-agarose beads. The isolated proteins are then imaged by AFM, and their mean molecular volume is compared with the molecular volume expected for the protein, based on its molecular mass. In this way, assembled multimers can be distinguished from unassembled subunits. The proteins are incubated with antibodies to the tags, and the resulting multimer-antibody complexes are imaged by AFM. Multimers with two bound antibodies are identified, and the angles between the antibodies are measured. A frequency distribution of these angles then reveals the architecture of the multimer. Here, we have used this method to study the stoichiometry of the TRPP2 homomer and the interaction of TRPP2 with TRPC1. We show that TRPP2 assembles a homotetramer and that TRPP2 and TRPC1 form a heterotetramer with a 2:2 stoichiometry and an alternating subunit arrangement. tsA 201 cells (a subclone of human embryonic kidney-293 cells stably expressing the SV40 large T-antigen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, air. DNA encoding human TRPP2 was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His vector (Invitrogen), which produces a protein tagged at its C terminus with Myc and His6 epitopes. Human TRPC1 DNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), which produces a protein tagged at its C terminus with V5 and His6 epitopes (13.Barrera N.P. Shaifta Y. McFadzean I. Ward J.P. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the sequence encoding the His6 tag was deleted from this construct to enable the expression of a protein containing only the V5 epitope. Transient transfections of tsA 201 cells with DNA were carried out using the CalPhosTM mammalian transfection kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 200 μg of DNA was used to transfect cells in five 162-cm2 culture flasks. When cells were doubly transfected, 100 μg of DNA for each construct was used. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C to allow protein expression. Protein expression and intracellular localization were checked using immunofluorescence analysis of small scale cultures. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, anti-V5, and anti-His6, all from Invitrogen; mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG, from Sigma; and rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc, from Abcam), followed by either Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat secondary antibodies (Sigma). Cells were imaged by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The solubilization/purification procedure was as described previously (24.Barrera N.P. Ormond S.J. Henderson R.M. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, a crude membrane fraction prepared from the cells was solubilized in 1% (w/v) CHAPS, and the solubilized material was incubated with Ni2+-agarose beads (Probond, Invitrogen). The beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting, using mouse monoclonal antibodies against Myc (TRPP2) or V5 (TRPC1). Isolated channels were imaged either alone or following overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 1:2 molar ratio (∼0.2 nm channel protein concentration) of anti-epitope tag monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen). Proteins were diluted to a final concentration of 0.04 nm, and 45 μl of the sample was allowed to adsorb to freshly cleaved, poly-l-lysine-coated mica disks. After a 10-min incubation, the sample was washed with Biotechnology Performance Certified-grade water (Sigma) and dried under nitrogen. Imaging was performed with a Veeco Digital Instruments Multimode AFM controlled by a Nanoscope IIIa controller. Samples were imaged in air, using tapping mode. The silicon cantilevers used had a drive frequency of ∼300 kHz and a specified spring constant of 40 newtons/m (Olympus). The applied imaging force was kept as low as possible (As/A0 ∼ 0.85). The molecular volumes of the protein particles were determined from particle dimensions based on AFM images. After adsorption of the channels onto the mica support, the particles adopt the shape of a spherical cap. As described previously (24.Barrera N.P. Ormond S.J. Henderson R.M. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the heights and radii were measured from multiple cross-sections of the same particle, and the molecular volume was calculated using the following equation, Vm=(πh/6)(3r2+h2)(Eq. 1) where h is the particle height and r is the radius. Molecular volume based on molecular mass was calculated using the equation, Vc=(M0/N0)(V1+dV2)(Eq. 2) where M0 is the molecular mass, N0 is Avogadro's number, V1 and V2 are the partial specific volumes of particle (0.74 cm3/g) and water (1 cm3/g), respectively, and d is the extent of protein hydration (taken as 0.4 g of water/g of protein). tsA 201 cells were transiently transfected with DNA encoding Myc/His6-tagged TRPP2, V5/His6-tagged TRPC1, or both constructs. Protein expression and localization was confirmed by immunofluorescence, using appropriate anti-tag antibodies. The staining signals with either anti-Myc or anti-His6 antibodies in cells transfected with DNA encoding TRPP2-Myc/His6 showed the expression of the channel (Fig. 1A, upper panels). In contrast, use of an anti-V5 antibody as a negative control produced only a background immunofluorescence signal. Conversely, cells transfected with TRPC1-V5/His6 gave positive immunofluorescence signals with anti-V5 and anti-His6 antibodies but not with anti-Myc (Fig. 1A, center panels). Cells transfected with both TRPP2-Myc/His6 and TRPC1-V5/His6 gave positive immunofluorescence signals with anti-Myc, anti-V5, and anti-His6 antibodies, indicating the presence of the two proteins (Fig. 1A, lower panels). As shown, the anti-Myc and anti-V5 signals in doubly labeled cell populations extensively overlapped, indicating that the majority of transfected cells expressed both TRPP2 and TRPC1. An anti-FLAG antibody gave only a background signal. The reticular staining patterns suggest that both TRPP2 and TRPC1 were localized predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum, as has been reported previously (5.Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A.

Crude membrane fractions prepared from cells expressing TRPP2-Myc/His6, TRPC1-V5/His6, or both proteins were solubilized in CHAPS detergent (1% (w/v)), and proteins were isolated through the binding of the His6 tags to Ni2+-agarose beads. Both the membrane fractions and the isolated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using either anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibodies. Anti-Myc labeled a band of molecular mass 110 kDa in fractions prepared from cells expressing TRPP2, and anti-V5 antibody labeled a band at 85 kDa in fractions from cells expressing TRPC1 (Fig. 1B). These bands are consistent with the expected sizes of the two subunits, with their epitope tags. Both immunoreactive bands were detected on immunoblots of fractions from cells expressing both proteins. Hence, the Ni2+-agarose beads successfully captured the appropriate proteins from the transfected cells. Proteins isolated from cells expressing TRPP2, TRPC1, and TRPP2-TRPC1 were imaged by AFM. A representative low magnification AFM image of particles isolated from TRPP2-expressing cells is shown in Fig. 2A. The image shows a homogenous spread of particles, indicating the presence of a single major protein species. Similar images were obtained from samples prepared from TRPC1-expressing and TRPP2-TRPC1-expressing cells (not shown). Frequency distributions of molecular volumes were produced for the three types of particles (Fig. 2, B–D). The mean ± S.E. molecular volumes were 847 ± 62 nm3 (n = 195) for TRPP2 (Fig. 2B), 797 ± 59 nm3 (n = 399) for TRPP2-TRPC1 (Fig. 2C), and 598 ± 24 nm3 (n = 111) for TRPC1 (Fig. 2D). The molecular volumes predicted for TRPP2 and TRPC1 subunits on the basis of their molecular masses are 209 and 161 nm3, respectively; hence, tetramers would have predicted molecular volumes of 836 nm3 (TRPP2) and 644 nm3 (TRPC1). The measured volumes, therefore, indicate a tetrameric structure in both cases, as already demonstrated for TRPC1 (13.Barrera N.P. Shaifta Y. McFadzean I. Ward J.P. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The size order of the three proteins is TRPP2 > TRPP2-TRPC1 > TRPC1. The observation that co-transfection with TRPP2 and TRPC1 produces particles of mean volume intermediate between the volumes of the two homomers is consistent with the possibility that TRPP2 and TRPC1 are interacting to form a heteromeric complex. However, given that the volume distributions are quite broad, a combination of TRPP2 and TRPC1 homomers might give a similar result. It should also be pointed out that measurement of molecular volumes by AFM is complicated by factors such as the convolution introduced by the geometry of the scanning tip. Hence, the measured volume is not by itself a reliable indicator of the stoichiometry of the channel. To conclusively establish the stoichiometry of the channels, they were imaged after antibody decoration. TRPP2 was imaged after incubation with the anti-Myc antibody (of the immunoglobulin G class), which should decorate the C-terminal Myc epitope tag present on each subunit. A low magnification AFM image of TRPP2-antibody complexes is shown in Fig. 3A. Several large particles can be seen, some of which have been decorated by either one (arrowhead) or two (arrows) smaller particles. The small particles had a molecular volume of around 260 nm3, close to the expected volume of 285 nm3 for an immunoglobulin G molecule, of molecular mass 150 kDa. Hence these particles represent anti-Myc antibodies bound to the Myc epitopes on the TRPP2 channel. A gallery of undecorated and singly and doubly decorated large particles is shown in Fig. 3B, along with an example of a triply decorated large particle. Of 888 large particles imaged, 520 (58.6%) were undecorated, 325 (36.6%) were singly decorated, 40 (4.5%) were doubly decorated, and three (0.3%) were triply decorated. No quadruply decorated channels were seen. This antibody decoration profile is similar to that predicted by the binomial distribution for a 12% occupancy of all potential binding sites (calculated assuming that the channel is a tetramer). We identified TRPP2 channels that had been decorated by two or three antibodies and measured the angles between the bound antibodies. This was done in each case by joining the highest point on the central particle (the TRPP2 channel) to the highest points on the peripheral particles (the antibodies) by lines and then determining the angle between the two lines. The frequency distribution of angles obtained is shown in Fig. 3C. The angle distribution has two peaks: a large peak at 87 ± 2° and a smaller peak at 170 ± 23°. The ratio of the numbers of particles within the two peaks is 2.8:1. For a homotetramer, the expected result is a distribution with peaks at 90 and 180° in the ratio 2:1, close to the observed ratio. In contrast, a trimer would give a single angle peak at 120° (24.Barrera N.P. Ormond S.J. Henderson R.M. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Edwardson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10759-10765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), whereas a pentamer would give equally sized peaks at 72 and 144° (21.Barrera N.P. Betts J. You H. Henderson R.M. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, the antibody decoration profile confirms that TRPP2 assembles as a homotetramer, as we have previously shown for TRPC1, using a similar experimental approach (13.Barrera N.P. Shaifta Y. McFadzean I. Ward J.P. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When proteins isolated from cells expressing both TRPP2-Myc/His6 and TRPC1-V5/His6 were incubated with anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibodies and then imaged by AFM, antibody-decorated large particles were again seen. A gallery of zoomed images of undecorated particles and particles that had been singly or doubly decorated by either anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibodies is shown in Fig. 4A. Of 1,267 large particles imaged, 27 (2.1%) were doubly decorated by anti-Myc antibodies. The extent of double decoration is therefore smaller than that seen with the TRPP2 homomer (above), indicating a reduced availability of antibody binding sites on each multimer. Similarly, of 745 large particles imaged, 38 (5.1%) were doubly decorated by anti-V5 antibodies, in comparison with 9.3% for the TRPC1 homomer under the same conditions (13.Barrera N.P. Shaifta Y. McFadzean I. Ward J.P. Henderson R.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 358: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No triply or quadruply decorated particles were seen for either anti-Myc or anti-V5 antibodies. The angles between the pairs of bound antibodies were measured and used to construct frequency distributions. As for the TRPP2 homomer, both distributions had two peaks (Fig. 4B). However, in marked contrast to the results for the homomer, the smaller peak was at 82 ± 4° for anti-Myc and 82 ± 3° for anti-V5, whereas the larger peak was at 165 ± 3° for anti-Myc and 165 ± 10° for anti-V5. The ratios of the number of particles within the two peaks were 1:2.4 for anti-Myc and 1:1.9 for anti-V5. These distributions show a strong preference for decoration of the TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer at around 180°, indicating a predominantly alternating subunit arrangement, as illustrated in Fig. 4C. The TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer showed small antibody decoration peaks at 90°, for both Myc and V5 epitope tags. These peaks could result from the isolation of minor populations of TRPP2 and TRPC1 homomers from the TRPP2-TRPC1-transfected cells. Alternatively, they could indicate that the architecture of the heteromer is not invariant and that some of the heteromers assemble with a TRPP2-TRPP2-TRPC1-TRPC1 arrangement. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we expressed a combination of TRPP2-Myc/His6 and TRPC1-V5 (lacking a His6 tag) in the tsA 201 cells. The normal isolation procedure was then used to produce protein complexes containing TRPP2-Myc/His6. Isolated proteins were then incubated with anti-V5 antibodies, which would decorate only heteromeric complexes containing TRPC-V5. A gallery of doubly decorated protein complexes is shown in Fig. 5A. All of the angles were now around 180°. Gaussian fitting showed that the frequency distribution of angles between pairs of bound antibodies (Fig. 5B) had only a single peak, at 165 ± 38° (n = 38); the peak at about 90° seen previously was not present. This result indicates that the heteromer assembles with the exclusive subunit arrangement TRPP2-TRPC1-TRPP2-TRPC1 and that the 90° peak was a result of the presence of a minority of homotetramers in the isolates from cells expressing both TRPP2-Myc/His6 and TRPC1-V5/His6. Our results demonstrate that the TRPP2 homomer assembles as a homotetramer, as has been shown previously for a number of other TRP channel family members (13.Barrera N.P. Shaifta Y. McFadzean I.

Chem. 2007; 282: 36961-36970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This finding directly contradicts the conclusion of a recent report that TRPP2 in the plasma membrane is a trimer (19.Yu Y. Ulbrich M.H. Li M.H. Buraei Z. Chen X.Z. Ong A.C. Tong L. Isacoff E.Y. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11558-11563Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The evidence presented in the previous report is 3-fold. First, TRPP2 migrated as three distinct bands on both blue native polyacrylamide gels and on conventional gels after chemical cross-linking; these bands were suggested to represent monomer, dimer, and trimer. Second, a coiled-coil domain present in the C-terminal region of TRPP2 crystallized as a trimer. Third, single-molecule fluorescence studies revealed that upon bleaching, the fluorescence of the molecules declined in a series of three steps. We suggest that is difficult to determine the precise molecular mass of proteins running close to the top of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (and above the largest molecular mass marker); indeed, the molecular mass of the largest cross-linked band was reported to be 400 kDa, between the values of 330 and 440 kDa expected for trimers and tetramers). Hence, the three bands seen could actually represent monomer, dimer, and tetramer. In addition, the behavior of a short (63-amino acid) peptide sequence in crystallographic studies might not reflect the behavior of the intact protein in the context of the plasma membrane. Finally, the possibility that in oocytes, exogenous TRPP2 associates with another endogenous protein to form a 3:1 complex cannot be excluded. In fact, the authors specifically mention endogenous TRPC1 as a possible binding partner. The formation of such a complex could account for the observed three-step bleaching pattern. The ability of different TRP channels, and especially different members of the TRPC subfamily, to interact physically and functionally is well known (e.g. see Refs. 26.Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar and 27.Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). These interactions have been detected by co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer and through the demonstration that co-expression of two different subunits produces channels with properties distinct from those formed after expression of either subunit alone (26.Strübing C. Krapivinsky G. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 27.Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 7461-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). None of these methods formally proves that the subunits form a heteromeric channel. It is equally possible that individual homomers interact together in such a way as to produce channels with novel properties. Such interactions have in fact been demonstrated for P2X receptors, which form signaling complexes not only with neighboring P2X receptors but also with Cys-loop receptors (28.Khakh B.S. Zhou X. Sydes J. Galligan J.J. Lester H.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and with channels belonging to the gap junction family (29.Pelegrin P. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5071-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Within the P2X receptor family itself, there is considerable evidence for a functional interaction between different subunits. For instance, it has been suggested that the P2X4 and P2X7 subtypes form a heteromeric receptor (30.Guo C. Masin M. Qureshi O.S. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, it has recently been demonstrated that the predominant assembly pathway of these two subunits, in at least two cell types, leads to the production of separate P2X4 and P2X7 homomers (31.Boumechache M. Masin M. Edwardson J.M. Górecki D.C. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13446-13454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TRPP2 has been shown to interact with both TRPC1 (10.Bai C.X. Giamarchi A. Rodat-Despoix L. Padilla F. Downs T. Tsiokas L. Delmas P. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and TRPV4 (11.Köttgen M. Buchholz B. Garcia-Gonzalez M.A. Kotsis F. Fu X. Doerken M. Boehlke C. Steffl D. Tauber R. Wegierski T. Nitschke R. Suzuki M. Kramer-Zucker A. Germino G.G. Watnick T. Prenen J. Nilius B. Kuehn E.W. Walz G. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The earliest evidence for an interaction between TRPP2 and TRPC1 involved co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation of the two subunits (32.Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This interaction was mapped to two regions of TRPP2: the cytosolic C terminus and a larger region, including transmembrane regions 2–6 and the connecting loops. Functional evidence for a TRPP2-TRPC1 interaction includes the production of a channel with novel physiological and pharmacological characteristics after co-expression of the two subunits (10.Bai C.X. Giamarchi A. Rodat-Despoix L. Padilla F. Downs T. Tsiokas L. Delmas P. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The channels formed by co-expression of TRPP2 and TRPC1 had single-channel conductance and ion permeability properties distinct from those observed in cells expressing either TRPP2 or TRPC1 alone. Further, the channels had distinct sensitivities to stimulation via the M1-muscarinic receptor and to blockade by amiloride. TRPP2 and TRPC1 were shown to be co-localized at the primary cilium and to be co-immunoprecipitated from kidney cell membranes. In these cells, manipulation of the levels of the two proteins produced functional effects that again indicated an interaction between TRPP2 and TRPC1. These results were taken to indicate the generation of a heteromeric TRPP2-TRPC1 channel; however, the presence of such a heteromer was not directly demonstrated. Recently, a detailed analysis of the channels generated by expression of TRPP2, TRPC1, and TRPP2 plus TRPC1 provided corroborative evidence for an interaction between the two proteins (20.Zhang P. Luo Y. Chasan B. González-Perrett S. Montalbetti N. Timpanaro G.A. Cantero M.del R. Ramos A.J. Goldmann W.H. Zhou J. Cantiello H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1238-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This study also included an attempt to visualize the heteromer directly using AFM. Purified TRPP2 and TRPC1 were reconstituted into liposomes either singly or together, and the liposomes were used to produce supported lipid bilayers for AFM imaging. When TRPP2 alone was imaged, the particles observed had a mean molecular volume of 3663 nm3, approximately 4 times larger than the particles detected in the present study and, significantly, 4 times larger than expected for a TRPP2 homotetramer. In contrast, the TRPC1 homomer appeared to be much smaller (mean molecular volume 1053 nm3), but was still almost twice the size that we report (and almost twice the volume expected for a homotetramer). It was reported that the contribution of TRPP2 and TRPC1 monomers to the heterotetramers could be distinguished on the basis of particle heights within the imaged complexes. Tetrameric features were seen, composed of two large and two small particles. On the basis of these images, it was concluded that the heterotetramer has a stoichiometry of 2 TRPP2:2 TRPC1. Although not explicitly stated, the subunit arrangement implied by the geometry of the complexes was TRPP2-TRPP2-TRPC1-TRPC1. The fact that the protein particles detected in this previous study (especially TRPP2) were so much larger than would be expected may give some cause for concern about what they actually represent. Furthermore, the generation of TRPP2-TRPC1 complexes after mixing of independently isolated proteins would necessitate the efficient disassembly of the two homotetramers and reassembly of heterotetramers. We feel that this process, if it occurs at all, is likely to be highly inefficient. For instance, in our previous studies of the architecture of 5-HT3 (21.Barrera N.P. Betts J. You H. Henderson R.M. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the GABAA receptor (22.Barrera N.P. Herbert P. Henderson R.M. Martin I.L. Edwardson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we have seen no evidence for rearrangement of multisubunit protein complexes after their isolation. In contrast to the results of Zhang et al. (20.Zhang P. Luo Y. Chasan B. González-Perrett S. Montalbetti N. Timpanaro G.A. Cantero M.del R. Ramos A.J. Goldmann W.H. Zhou J. Cantiello H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 1238-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the isolated channels imaged in our study have the expected molecular volumes. The multimeric structure of the channels was not directly visible in our AFM images, a phenomenon that we have reported previously for other multisubunit proteins of approximately the same size, such as the 5-HT3 receptor (21.Barrera N.P. Betts J. You H. Henderson R.M. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M. Edwardson J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the GABAA receptor (22.Barrera N.P. Herbert P. Henderson R.M. Martin I.L. Edwardson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Instead, we revealed the tetrameric structure of both the TRPP2 homomer and the TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer using imaging of antibody-decorated complexes. The ratio of 90°/180° angles for pairs of antibodies bound to the TRPP2 homomer (2.8:1) is close to the predicted value of 2:1. In contrast, the decoration profiles for both epitope tags on the TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer strongly favor the 180° angle, indicating that the subunit stoichiometry is 2:2 and that the subunit distribution around the channel pore is TRPP2-TRPC1-TRPP2-TRPC1. In our experiments, we used equal amounts of DNA for the two constructs when expressing the TRPP2-TRPC1 heteromer. Although there is not necessarily a direct relationship between the amount of DNA used and the relative level of protein expression, our method probably favors the generation of heteromers containing equal numbers of the two subunits. The possibility remains that the subunit stoichiometry of the heteromer is not fixed but rather can be manipulated by changing the relative expression levels of the two subunits, as we have previously found for the P2X2-P2X6 receptor heteromer (23.Barrera N.P. Henderson R.M. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Edwardson J.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 505-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The method described here will allow us to study the interaction of TRPP2 with other proteins. For instance, we should be able to test whether TRPP2 and TRPV4 form a heteromer with the same subunit stoichiometry and arrangement as that reported here for TRPP2 and TRPC1. In addition, we should be able to determine the architecture of the complex formed between TRPP2 and polycystin-1 and to ascertain how clinically significant mutations in TRPP2 affect its ability to interact with its protein partners. We are optimistic that this approach will shed light on the etiology of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. We thank A. Stewart for help with the immunofluorescence experiments and S. Carnally and N. Barrera for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2083552104,"The sex determination transcription factor SRY is a cell fate-determining transcription factor that mediates testis differentiation during embryogenesis. It may function by repressing the ovarian determinant gene, RSPO1, action in the ovarian developmental pathway and activates genes, such as SOX9, important for testis differentiation at the onset of gonadogenesis. Further, altered expression of SRY and related SOX genes contribute to oncogenesis in many human cancers. Little is known of the mechanisms by which SRY regulates its target genes. Recently a KRAB domain protein (KRAB-O) that lacks a zinc finger motif has been demonstrated to interact with SRY and hypothesized to function as an adaptor molecule for SRY by tethering the KAP1-NuRD-SETDB1-HP1 silencing machinery to repress SRY targets. We have critically examined this hypothesis by reconstituting and characterizing SRY-KRAB-O-KAP1 interactions. These recombinant molecules can form a ternary complex by direct and high affinity interactions. The KRAB-O protein can simultaneously bind KAP1 and SRY in a noncompetitive but also noncooperative manner. An extensive mutagenesis analysis suggests that different surfaces on KRAB-O are utilized for these independent interactions. Transcriptional repression by SRY requires binding to KRAB-O, thus bridging to the KAP1 repression machinery. This repression machinery is recruited to SRY target promoters in chromatin templates via SRY. These results suggest that SRY has co-opted the KRAB-O protein to recruit the KAP1 repression machinery to sex determination target genes. Other KRAB domain proteins, which lack a zinc finger DNA-binding motif, may function in similar roles as adaptor proteins for epigenetic gene silencing.

The KRAB-O protein can simultaneously bind KAP1 and SRY in a noncompetitive but also noncooperative manner. An extensive mutagenesis analysis suggests that different surfaces on KRAB-O are utilized for these independent interactions. Transcriptional repression by SRY requires binding to KRAB-O, thus bridging to the KAP1 repression machinery. This repression machinery is recruited to SRY target promoters in chromatin templates via SRY. These results suggest that SRY has co-opted the KRAB-O protein to recruit the KAP1 repression machinery to sex determination target genes. Other KRAB domain proteins, which lack a zinc finger DNA-binding motif, may function in similar roles as adaptor proteins for epigenetic gene silencing. Analysis of the human genome sequence revealed 423 independent KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) domains of KRAB-zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) 4The abbreviations used are: ZFPzinc finger proteinKAP1KRAB-associated protein 1RBCC domainRING finger, B boxes, and Coiled-coil regionGSTglutathione S-transferaseIVTin vitro translatedHMGhigh mobility groupBRGbridgehhumanmmouseHAhemagglutininChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationWTwild typeTKthymidine kinase. genes, yielding alternative transcripts that altogether predict at least 742 structurally distinct proteins (1.Huntley S.

The KRAB domain is mainly found in the NH2 termini of Krüppel-related ZFPs, and it is classically divided into an A box and a B box encoded by separate exons (see Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). By comparing the amino acid sequences of the KRAB domain, KRAB-ZFPs can be classified into several subfamilies: KRAB(AB), KRAB(Ab), and KRAB(AC) (2.Peng H. Gibson L.C. Capili A.D. Borden K.L.

Most of the KRAB-ZFPs contain tandem zinc finger modules in their COOH termini. These zinc finger modules can number from 3 to upwards of 40 in a single protein and presumably participate in DNA recognition. KRAB-mediated gene silencing is absolutely dependent on binding to its co-repressor protein, KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) (3.Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P.

Most KRAB domain proteins harbor zinc finger motifs; however, there are a few exceptions. One of them is KRAB-O (KRAB only), which is an alternatively spliced transcript from Zfp748 gene (formerly called Zfp208, a mouse homologue of the human ZNF208); the second is the VHLaK (pVHL-associated KRAB-A), which is an alternatively spliced transcript from Znf197 gene; and the third is MIF1 (mouse inhibitor of four 1) (11.Oh H.J.

Commun. 2006; 348: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The functional relationship between KRAB domain proteins with or without zinc finger motifs is currently unknown. It has been postulated that KRAB domain proteins without zinc fingers may act as dominant negative regulators for those with zinc fingers, or alternatively these different splice variants might function independently of each other. KRAB-O was identified as an SRY (sex-determining region Y)-interacting protein through the yeast two-hybrid screen (11.Oh H.J. Li Y. Lau Y.F. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). KRAB-O and KRAB-ZFP748 contain KRAB-A and KRAB-B boxes, and their transcripts are expressed in embryonic gonads. ZFP748 does not interact with SRY under the same experimental conditions used for KRAB-O interaction analysis. KRAB-O co-localizes with SRY and KAP1 directly and with HP1 indirectly in the nuclei of transfected cultured cells and mouse fetal gonadal cells, suggesting that SRY might use the KRAB-KAP1-mediated repression complexes to regulate the transcription of its target genes. A recent study from the Koopman group (14.Polanco J.C. Wilhelm D. Mizusaki H. Jackson A. Browne C. Davidson T. Harley V. Sinclair A. Koopman P. Biol. Cell. 2009; 101: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) shows that more than 100 KRAB genes were found to be expressed in mouse developing gonads, including 19 transcripts encoded by the KRAB-O cluster that were found to be expressed in somatic cells at 11.5 days post-coitum. The knockdown of KRAB genes decreases expression of SOX9 (SRY-related HMG-box 9) in a gonadal cell line stably expressing SRY, suggesting a important role for KRAB-O and other KRAB-ZNF genes in mediating SRY function. SRY/Sry encodes a putative transcription factor with a HMG DNA-binding domain. The mouse SRY contains an HMG box at its NH2 terminus, a bridge region (BRG) at its central region, and a glutamine-rich domain at its COOH terminus (see Fig. 2A). The human SRY (hSRY) contains additional domains with unknown functions at both the NH2 terminus and the COOH terminus, but not the Q-domain (see Fig. 2A). The HMG box is the only evolutionarily conserved domain among all of the mammalian SRY genes analyzed so far. It binds and bends DNA in vitro in a sequence-specific manner (15.Harley V.R.

These properties are essential for SRY as a sex-determining factor because mutations that change these activities are shown to cause gonadal dysgenesis in humans (18.Mitchell C.L. Harley V.R. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 77: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant expression of SRY and other SOX (SRY box-containing) genes is associated with the development and/or progression of certain cancers. SOX17-mediated gene silencing is associated with DNA hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region. The CpG island methylation-dependent silencing of SOX17 occurs in 100% of colorectal cancer cell lines, 86% of colorectal adenoma, 100% of stage I and II colorectal cancer, and other cancers (19.Zhang W. Glöckner S.C. Guo M. Machida E.O. Wang D.H. Easwaran H. Van Neste L. Herman J.G. Schuebel K.E. Watkins D.N. Ahuja N. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Hence understanding how the SRY and SOX transcription factors regulate their target genes may be important in elucidating the molecular mechanism(s) by which these developmental genes exert their effects on oncogenesis. SRY has been hypothesized to function as a transcriptional repressor for ovarian differentiation and activator for testicular differentiation during gonadogenesis (11.Oh H.J. Li Y. Lau Y.F. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20.Oh H.J. Lau Y.F. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2006; 247: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although SRY has been demonstrated to repress WNT signaling associated with RSPO1, the ovarian determinant (21.Parma P. Radi O. Vidal V. Chaboissier M.C. Dellambra E. Valentini S. Guerra L. Schedl A.

Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 25.Sekido R. Lovell-Badge R. Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), the exact mechanisms by which SRY and SOX genes exert their transcriptional regulation functions on their target genes are uncertain. Our initial observations are that the BRG of SRY is necessary and sufficient for binding to the KRAB-O protein and that the HMG box can optimize this binding (11.Oh H.J. Li Y. Lau Y.F. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 72: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We postulate that SRY interactions with other co-regulators, particularly KRAB-O, are essential for its functions as either a transactivator or repressor of its target genes. We have performed a systematic analysis for the interaction of SRY/KRAB domains from the KRAB-ZFPs and have characterized these proteins and protein complexes using a biochemical approach. We define the detail of direct interactions between the KRAB-O/KRAB domain and the SRY proteins. The KRAB-O/KRAB domain directly and simultaneously interacts with SRY and KAP1 through specific binding surfaces that support the hypothesis that KRAB-O functions as a bridging molecule between KAP1 and SRY proteins. We also demonstrated that the KRAB-O/KRAB-KAP1-mediated repression complex could down-regulate the hSRY-mediated transcriptional activation of a reporter gene. Therefore, this study provides the biochemical and biological functional evidence to support a working model involving KRAB-O/KRAB-KAP1 interactions for SRY action(s) on sex determination and differentiation. For details of plasmids, see the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” [35S]Methionine-labeled, in vitro translated (IVT) mSRY and hSRY proteins were made using the TNT SP6/T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The KRAB-O protein was prepared from a GST-KRAB-O fusion protein by thrombin digestion as previous described (2.Peng H. Gibson L.C. Capili A.D. Borden K.L. Osborne M.J. Harper S.L. Speicher D.W.

The His-tagged KAP1-RBCC protein was purified at 4 °C under native conditions as recommended by manufacturer (Qiagen) (26.Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W.

Fifty μl of [35S]methionine-labeled, mSRY (IVT) protein, KRAB-O protein, and KRAB-O-mSRY protein complex were analyzed by gel filtration with a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.0) with 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine. The column was at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The proteins or protein complex from each fraction was concentrated by deoxycholate-trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The precipitated proteins were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1 m NaOH. Twenty μl of the resuspended protein sample were resolved on NuPAGE (Invitrogen), and the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain and autoradiography. The preparation of the GST fusion proteins and the GST association assays were performed essentially as described previously (27.Ryan R.F. Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Singh P.B. Friedman J.R.

Briefly, 5 μg of freshly prepared GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 20 μl of IVT SRY proteins or/and with 10 μg of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-purified recombinant His-tagged KAP1-RBCC protein in 0.5 ml of BB500 buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The protein complexes were washed four times with BB750 buffer, followed by two times with BB500 buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in 5× Laemmli buffer, resolved by NuPAGE, and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain and autoradiography. Ten μg of freshly prepared GST-KRAB fusion protein was first immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose, followed by the binding of IVT SRY and purified KAP1-RBCC proteins under three different binding conditions: 1) Equilibrium: 20 μl of IVT SRY was premixed with 40 μg of purified KAP1-RBCC protein in 0.5 ml of BB500 buffer, and then the mix proteins were added into the GST-KRAB fusion protein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature; 2) GST-KRAB fusion protein was first saturated with KAP1-RBCC protein: 40 μg of purified KAP1-RBCC protein was added to the GST-KRAB fusion protein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then 20 μl of IVT SRY was added into the reaction and incubated for additional 1 h; and 3) GST-KRAB fusion protein was first saturated with SRY protein: 20 μl of IVT SRY was added to the GST-KRAB fusion protein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and the 40 μg of purified KAP1-RBCC protein was added to the reaction and incubated for additional 1 h. The protein complexes were washed and eluted in 5× Laemmli buffer, resolved by NuPAGE, and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain and fluorography. Two cell lines (HEK 293 and U2OS) and three reporter systems (GAL4-TK-Luc, LexA-TK-Luc, and 10xSRY-TK-Luc) were used in transient transfection, respectively. HEK 293 cells or U2OS cells were transiently transfected with one of the reporter plasmids described above, the pcDNA3-β-galactosidase expression plasmids, and the effector plasmids. At 40–72 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized with β-galactosidase activity (Pierce). The cytoplasmic fraction from these cells was prepared in Tween 20 lysis buffer for β-galactosidase and Luciferase assay as described (29.Klenova E. Chernukhin I. Inoue T. Shamsuddin S. Norton J. Methods. 2002; 26: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The nuclear pellet was resuspended in Tween 20 lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. The nuclear fraction was used for Western blot analyses with anti-GAL4 (DNA-binding domain) rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz), LexA D19 goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz), FLAG-M2 monoclonal IgG (Sigma), and HA monoclonal IgG (Covance) to detect the expressed proteins. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot, the nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with HA antibody (agarose immobilized rabbit anti-HA; ICL Lab) in Tween 20 lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were washed with the same buffer three times and eluted in 5× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies as indicated above. ChIP was performed as described in the supplemental “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and analyzed by quantitative PCR on the CPTICON2 (MJ Research Inc.) using SYBR Green technology. The domain structure of the KRAB-O protein is similar to the subclass of KRAB (AB)-ZFPs containing a classical A box and a classical B box except that it has an additional four amino acids at its COOH terminus (Fig. 1A). The amino acids in the A and B boxes are highly conserved between KRAB-O and the other KRAB domains (Fig. 1A) except for the variance of a few amino acids. Previous studies have mapped the amino acids in the KRAB domain that are important for its transcription repression function (30.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H. Thiesen H.J. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 31.Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Leaf A. Onaldi D. Bonventre J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 4514-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Whether these highly conserved amino acids in the context of KRAB-O are critical for its repression function remains to be determined. Previous studies indicate that the A box of a KRAB domain is sufficient for repression function and KAP1-RBCC binding (2.Peng H. Gibson L.C. Capili A.D. Borden K.L. Osborne M.J. Harper S.L. Speicher D.W. Zhao K. Marmorstein R. Rock T.A. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 269-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K. Vissing H.

We sought to examine the role of KRAB domain-containing proteins, not only KRAB-O, but also other KRAB-ZFPs, in the regulation of SRY through the formation of a ternary complex with KAP1. Because the amino acid sequence of the BRG region in mSRY and in hSRY is highly conserved, we tested whether KRAB-O/KRAB proteins interact with these proteins with similar affinity. GST association assays were carried out with GST-KRAB-O/KRAB proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) and IVT SRY proteins (Fig. 2A). All of the KRAB domain-containing proteins directly interacted with both mSry and hSRY proteins (Fig. 1B). The KRAB-O protein showed a higher affinity for SRY proteins compared with the other KRAB domains. The KOX1-KRAB DV-AA mutant protein, which cannot interact with KAP1, still bound to mSRY and hSRY proteins (Fig. 1B), suggesting that SRY molecules may utilize different binding surfaces on KRAB domains than KAP1. The amino acid sequences of HMG and BRG domains of SRYs among mammalian species are highly conserved. However, there is no significant similarity of the amino acid sequences between the BRG domain of SRY and the RBCC domain of KAP1. Thus, it is suspected that the BRG domain and the RBCC domain recognize different amino acids in a KRAB domain-containing molecule so that the KRAB domain can interact with BRG domain and the RBCC domain simultaneously. To test this hypothesis, the KAP1-RBCC, mSRY, and hSRY proteins were expressed (Fig. 2A), and we examined whether both SRY and KAP1-RBCC proteins were able to bind KRAB-O and KRAB simultaneously without interference. The known interacting proteins for KAP1, mSRY, and hSRY are summarized in Fig. 2A. These data suggest that two proteins known to associate with KRAB domain-containing proteins, KAP1 and SRY, may form a ternary complex with KRAB family members in a manner that does not require zinc finger motifs. We previously employed biochemical and biophysical analyses of the KRAB domains and in a complex with the KAP1-RBCC domain (2.Peng H. Gibson L.C. Capili A.D. Borden K.L. Osborne M.J. Harper S.L. Speicher D.W. Zhao K. Marmorstein R. Rock T.A. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 269-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28.Peng H. Begg G.E. Harper S.L. Friedman J.R. Speicher D.W. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18000-18010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain is predominantly monomeric either alone or in a complex with the KAP1-RBCC protein. Gel filtration chromatography was used to test whether the KRAB-O and SRY protein form a stable complex in vitro. Under physiological buffer conditions, the IVT mSRY protein alone (calculated molecular mass of the monomer is 25.3 kDa) eluted in a single peak of ≥44 kDa, suggesting that it may be either a dimer or an extended monomer (Fig. 2B). The purified KRAB-O protein alone (calculated molecular mass of the monomer is 9.5 kDa) eluted in a single peak of ≤44 kDa, consistent with either a dimeric form of the protein or a monomeric form with asymmetric shape of protein (Fig. 2B). We then tested whether KRAB-O and SRY proteins form a stable complex in vitro. GST-KRAB-O was immobilized in GST resin and incubated with IVT mSRY. The protein complex was washed intensively, followed by thrombin digestion. The eluted protein complex was loaded on to a Superdex 75 column. Both proteins co-eluted in the same fractions from the column, suggesting that KRAB-O formed a stable complex with SRY (Fig. 2C). The elution of the KRAB-O protein was shifted one fraction up in complex form, as compared with the pattern when it was eluted alone (Fig. 2, B and C, compare fraction 10; B, bottom panel to fraction 9, and C, top panel). Mouse SRY protein was eluted in the same fraction of the column with or without association with KRAB-O (Fig. 2, B and C, compare fractions 9 and 10; B, top panel to fraction 9 and 10, and C, bottom panel). Taken together, these data suggest that KRAB-O forms a stable complex with mSRY protein, and this complex can be sustained under vigorous chromatography conditions. To test whether KRAB domain-containing proteins can form a ternary complex with SRY and KAP1, a competition assay was performed with GST-KRAB-O and IVT SRY protein in the presence or absence of KAP1-RBCC protein. KRAB-O, SRY, and KAP1-RBCC proteins formed a ternary protein complex (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the binding of KAP1-RBCC did not interfere with the ability of KRAB-O to bind to SRY, and vice versa, as evidenced by comparing the retention of SRY in the presence (+) and absence (−) of the KAP1-RBCC protein in the competition assay (Fig. 3A). These findings suggest that SRY association with KRAB-O is not dependent on KAP1. To determine whether there is direct interaction between SRY and KAP1, GST association assay was performed with GST-KAP1 and IVT SRY. As expected, the KRAB-O protein directly binds to SRY protein (supplemental Fig. S2). In contrast, no binding of SRY protein to GST or GST-KAP1 was detected (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that SRY does not directly interact with KAP1. To determine whether other KRAB domains can form a ternary complex with SRY and KAP1, a competition assay was performed with GST-KOX1-KRAB (WT and DV-AA mutant) proteins and IVT SRY proteins in the presence or absence of the KAP1-RBCC protein. The DV-AA mutation in the KRAB domain prevents its ability to associate with KAP1. The binding of KAP1-RBCC did not interfere the ability of KOX1-KRAB to bind to SRY (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the DV-AA mutant of GST-KOX1-KRAB still exhibited an ability to bind SRY protein, suggesting that the SRY association with KOX1-KRAB is not dependent on KAP1 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that KRAB domains can bind KAP1 and SRY simultaneously, and these proteins form a ternary complex in vitro. To examine whether KRAB domains interact with SRY and KAP1 via different binding surfaces, KRAB-O as well as other KRAB domains (WT and mutant) from other ZFPs were used in competition assays, which were performed under three different conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures”: 1) equilibrium (Fig. 3C), 2) GST-KRAB fusion proteins first saturated with KAP1-RBCC protein (supplemental Fig. S3A), and 3) GST-KRAB fusion proteins first saturated with SRY protein (supplemental Fig. S3B). The KRAB-O and KRAB domains of other KRAB-ZFPs interacted with SRY and KAP1 proteins simultaneously. The KRAB-O protein showed a higher binding affinity for SRY protein than other KRAB domains under these experimental conditions (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3). These data indicate that KRAB, SRY, and KAP1 formed a ternary complex. Although it did not bind to the KAP1 under all of these experimental conditions, the KOX1-KRAB DV-AA mutant protein still interacted with SRY proteins (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3). These data, when taken together, suggest that KRAB domains associate with SRY and KAP1 via different binding surfaces. Moreover, SRY interacts with the KRAB domains of numerous KRAB-ZFPs in addition to KRAB-O. To define the molecule binding surfaces on KRAB-O that are specific for KAP1 and SRY, we made deletions and mutations in KRAB-O (Fig. 1A). The deletions were made of either the A box or the B box (Fig. 1A, blue). All of the mutations were made by the substitution of the conserved and the nonconserved amino acids to alanines. The effects of these mutations on KAP1 and SRY binding are summarized in Fig. 1A (red and green, respectively). Mutations that do not affect KAP1 and SRY binding are also noted (Fig. 1A, yellow). The KRAB-O (deletion and mutant) proteins were expressed as a GST fusion, purified in Escherichia coli, and then analyzed for KAP1-RBCC and SRY protein binding (Fig. 4). Previous studies indicated that the A box of KRAB domain is necessary for binding to KAP1 in a manner in which it confers its repression function, whereas the B box facilitates this binding and optimizes the repression function (2.Peng H.

Using a combined stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-proteomics methodology, we identified the cytoplasmic scaffold protein p62 as the molecular target of IDR-1.

In addition, IDR-1 induced p38 MAPK activity in a p62-dependent manner and increased CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein β activity, whereas NF-κB activity was unaffected. Collectively, these results demonstrate that IDR-1 binding to p62 specifically affects protein-protein interactions and subsequent downstream events.

In addition, IDR-1 enhances production of some monocyte-produced chemokines, including MCP-1 and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10. IDR-1 also suppresses production of Toll-like receptor-induced proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 and TNFα (1.Scott M.G. Dullaghan E. Mookherjee N. Glavas N. Waldbrook M. Thompson A.

Previously, the effects of IDR-1 were postulated to impact several intracellular pathways, including MAPK p38 and C/EBP, but the preceding molecular events remained unknown.In this study, the cytoplasmic protein sequestosome-1 (p62) was identified as a molecular target of IDR-1. p62 is a multidomain scaffold (adaptor) protein, with many known interacting partners, including PKCζ (2.Moscat J.

The ubiquitin-associated domain is also considered the basis for the association between p62 and protein trafficking to the proteasome (9.Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Wooten M.W.

Thus, p62 functions as a nodal point in cellular signaling pathways, particularly in the regulation of NF-κB (11.Duran A. Linares J.F. Galvez A.S. Wikenheiser K. Flores J.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J.

This binding event selectively stabilized TNFα-induced p62-RIP1 complex formation, but not TNFα-induced p62-PKCξ complex formation, and specifically modulated the downstream signaling pathways by activating MAPK p38 and C/EBPβ but not NF-κB. These studies provide new evidence for p62 as an important component of the immune system and demonstrate that IDR-1 can be used for the interrogation of the molecular events governing these innate responses.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExperimental Procedures are detailed in the supplemental material.DISCUSSIONThe intracellular signaling network in host cells allows for efficient communication between the sensing of an incoming pathogen and the initiation of anti-infective responses. The p62 protein is emerging as one of the central signaling hubs of the cell, controlling this process (8.Jin Z. Li Y. Pitti R. Lawrence D. Pham V.C. Lill J.R. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2009; 137: 721-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 9.Seibenhener M.L. Geetha T. Wooten M.W.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).The data presented here demonstrate direct binding of IDR-1 to p62 and provide evidence that this binding has specific consequences on protein-protein interactions, as well as on downstream signaling pathways. p62 was discovered as the intracellular target of IDR-1 by an unbiased, non-hypothesis-driven proteomics approach. Due to high affinity of IDR-1 for p62, it is likely that p62 is the most physiologically relevant target. Although we identified XIAP-4 in the SILAC experiments, strong direct binding of IDR-1 to XIAP was not detected in human cell lysates, nor was binding to XIAP detected with other related IDR peptides that did bind p62. Another IDR-1 weak binding partner, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was also recently described (22.Mookherjee N. Lippert D.N. Hamill P. Falsafi R. Nijnik A. Kindrachuk J. Pistolic J. Gardy J. Miri P. Naseer M. Foster L.J. Hancock R.E. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Human p62 was confirmed as the IDR-1 target using binding assays and pulldown experiments from both endogenous and p62-overexpressing cell lysates. IDR-1 binding to both human and mouse p62, which share 99% amino acid sequence identity, was demonstrated. Through the investigation of p62 deletion mutants, we discovered that IDR-1 binds to the ZZ domain of p62, a zinc-binding protein interaction domain. Most compounds that act on protein-protein interactions antagonize or inhibit complex formation, but IDR-1 addition to cells led to a surprisingly specific effect; the TNFα-dependent receptor signaling complex of RIP1 and p62, which occurs at the ZZ domain, was stabilized, whereas the p62-PKCζ complex, which occurs at the PB1 domain proximal to the RIP1 binding region, was not affected.The specific modulation of p62 signaling complexes by IDR-1 appears to have a corresponding effect on the downstream signaling. On one hand, p62 has been described as an activator of NF-κB due to its receptor-induced signaling complex formation with PKCζ (11.Duran A. Linares J.F. Galvez A.S. Wikenheiser K. Flores J.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 343-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12.Durán A. Serrano M. Leitges M. Flores J.M. Picard S. Brown J.P. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 303-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), but IDR-1 treatment did not modulate NF-κB activity downstream of TNFα, consistently with the p62-PKCζ complex formation being unaffected. On the other hand, p38 MAPK activation downstream of TNFα is regulated by RIP1 (23.Lee T.H. Huang Q. Oikemus S. Shank J. Ventura J.J. Cusson N. Vaillancourt R.R. Su B. Davis R.J. Kelliher M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8377-8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the increase of RIP1-p62 interaction by IDR-1 may explain the previously reported role of IDR-1 in p38-mediated signaling pathways (1.Scott M.G. Dullaghan E. Mookherjee N. Glavas N. Waldbrook M. Thompson A. Wang A. Lee K. Doria S. Hamill P. Yu J.J. Li Y. Donini O. Guarna M.M. Finlay B.B. North J.R. Hancock R.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This is further strengthened by the observation that IDR-1-mediated activation of p38 is dependent on p62. The IDR-1-induced activation of C/EBPβ, downstream of p38, is also consistent with these and previous findings. Thus, we propose that the specific effects on intracellular signaling presented here contribute to the previously described IDR-1-modulated cytokine profile (Fig. 3F).IDR-1 has been demonstrated to prevent and treat infections and reduce associated inflammation (1.Scott M.G. Dullaghan E. Mookherjee N. Glavas N. Waldbrook M. Thompson A. Wang A. Lee K. Doria S. Hamill P. Yu J.J. Li Y. Donini O. Guarna M.M. Finlay B.B. North J.R. Hancock R.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies report that p62 expression contributes to regulating macrophage-mediated (21.Kim J.Y. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 2131-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and cancer-associated inflammation (11.Duran A. Linares J.F. Galvez A.S. Wikenheiser K. Flores J.M. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Blood. 2009; 113: 4894-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), raising the question as to whether IDR-1 might also affect inflammatory responses in the absence of pathogen stimulation. The discovery that p62 is the target of IDR-1 highlights the importance of p62 in innate immunity and reveals p62 as a potential therapeutic target for anti-infective therapy without induction of harmful inflammation, and conversely, potential anti-inflammatory therapy with added anti-infective function.

https://openalex.org/W1990912999,"In metabolomics researches using mass spectrometry (MS), systematic searching of high-resolution mass data against compound databases is often the first step of metabolite annotation to determine elemental compositions possessing similar theoretical mass numbers. However, incorrect hits derived from errors in mass analyses will be included in the results of elemental composition searches. To assess the quality of peak annotation information, a novel methodology for false discovery rates (FDR) evaluation is presented in this study. Based on the FDR analyses, several aspects of an elemental composition search, including setting a threshold, estimating FDR, and the types of elemental composition databases most reliable for searching are discussed.The FDR can be determined from one measured value (i.e., the hit rate for search queries) and four parameters determined by Monte Carlo simulation. The results indicate that relatively high FDR values (30-50%) were obtained when searching time-of-flight (TOF)/MS data using the KNApSAcK and KEGG databases. In addition, searches against large all-in-one databases (e.g., PubChem) always produced unacceptable results (FDR >70%). The estimated FDRs suggest that the quality of search results can be improved not only by performing more accurate mass analysis but also by modifying the properties of the compound database. A theoretical analysis indicates that FDR could be improved by using compound database with smaller but higher completeness entries.High accuracy mass analysis, such as Fourier transform (FT)-MS, is needed for reliable annotation (FDR <10%). In addition, a small, customized compound database is preferable for high-quality annotation of metabolome data."
https://openalex.org/W2128353875,"Human placental multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hPMSCs) can be isolated from term placenta, but their angiogenic ability and the regulatory pathways involved are not known. hPMSCs were shown to express integrins αv, α4, α5, β1, β3, and β5 and could be induced to differentiate into cells expressing endothelial markers. Increases in cell surface integrins α5 and β1, but not α4, αvβ3, or αvβ5, accompanied endothelial differentiation. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A augmented the effect of fibronectin in enhancing adhesion and migration of differentiated hPMSC through integrin α5β1, but not αvβ3 or αvβ5. Formation of capillary-like structures in vitro from differentiated cells was inhibited by pre-treatment with function-blocking antibodies to integrins α5 and β1. When hPMSCs were seeded onto chick chorioallantoic membranes (CAM), human von Willebrand factor-positive cells were observed to engraft in the chick endothelium. CAMs transplanted with differentiated hPMSCs had a greater number of vessels containing human cells and more incorporated cells per vessel compared to CAMs transplanted with undifferentiated hPMSCs, and overall angiogenesis was enhanced more by the differentiated cells. Function-blocking antibodies to integrins α5 and β1 inhibited angiogenesis in the CAM assay. These results suggest that differentiated hPMSCs may contribute to blood vessel formation, and this activity depends on integrin α5β1."
https://openalex.org/W1967397050,"Isoform-specific protein kinase C (PKC) activators may be useful as therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Three new epsilon-specific PKC activators, made by cyclopropanation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been developed. These activators, AA-CP4, EPA-CP5, and DHA-CP6, activate PKCepsilon in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike PKC activators that bind to the 1,2-diacylglycerol-binding site, such as bryostatin and phorbol esters, which produce prolonged down-regulation, the new activators produced sustained activation of PKC. When applied to cells expressing human APPSwe/PS1delta, which produce large quantities of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), DCP-LA and DHA-CP6 reduced the intracellular and secreted levels of Abeta by 60-70%. In contrast to the marked activation of alpha-secretase produced by PKC activators in fibroblasts, the PKC activators produced only a moderate and transient activation of alpha-secretase in neuronal cells. However, they activated endothelin-converting enzyme to 180% of control levels, suggesting that the Abeta-lowering ability of these PKCepsilon activators is caused by increasing the rate of Abeta degradation by endothelin-converting enzyme and not by activating nonamyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein metabolism."

DEAD-box mHel61 (also termed REH1) is the only predicted helicase known to impact RNA editing (28Missel A. Souza A.E. Nörskau G. Göringer H.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins are likely to have additional roles outside editing. RNA helicases are common across species and typically multifunctional; however, only a few examples have been studied in mitochondria. This work characterized the protein and RNA interactions of a factor REH2 (Tb927.4.1500) that we initially found in native editing complexes of Trypanosoma brucei. REH2 has a conserved dsRNA-binding (dsRBD) and DExH-helicase domains and forms novel ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) containing helicase activity, gRNA, and a protein array that overlaps with MRB-related complexes. The integrity of REH2 RNPs as well as their helicase and gRNA binding activities require the dsRBD. REH2 associates, via RNA, with RECC, a battery of accessory editing factors, and mitochondrial ribosomes; thereby, we propose that REH2 RNPs are integral components of RNA-linked supramolecular networks that orchestrate the expression of the mitochondrial genome. A TAP-REH2 construct was made by PCR amplification of the entire open reading frame from procyclic genomic DNA using a proofreading thermostable polymerase mix (AccuTaq, Sigma) and cloning into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pLew79-ada-TAP. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed directly on this plasmid to alter the helicase motif I with oligonucleotides F-REH2-mI and R-REH2-mI and to delete the dsRBD with oligonucleotides F-dsRBD-Δ and R-dsRBD-Δ. An RNAi construct was obtained by cloning an REH2 fragment of 1665 bp into p2T7-177 (29Wickstead B. Ersfeld K. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, linearized with NotI, and transfected in procyclic 29-13 trypanosomes (30Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). REH2-TAP expression and RNAi were induced with tetracycline at 1 μg/ml. Native editing complexes were purified by ion-exchange chromatography from mitochondrial extracts (3Rusché L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4069-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Hernandez A. Panigrahi A. Cifuentes-Rojas C. Sacharidou A. Stuart K. Cruz-Reyes J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and TAP purifications were performed essentially as reported (31Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Sedimentation fractions were obtained from freshly made mitochondria or whole-cell extracts in 10–30% glycerol gradients. Although our protocols to prepare the extracts include DNase I, a sample indicated in the text was subjected to an extra DNase treatment (DNA-free kit, Ambion) prior to sedimentation. Catalase and thyroglobulin were used as ∼10 S and ∼20 S markers, and Western blots of Tbmp45 (formerly termed REAP1) were used to determine the ∼40 S region (32Cruz-Reyes J. Sollner-Webb B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8901-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified REH2 antibodies were produced against the peptide CSHTPTTSAEAGGDS (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc). Immunoprecipitations of endogenous and ectopic REH2 used antibody-conjugated protein A-Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Ectopic REH2 was specifically immunopurified using anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads (Invitrogen). All washes were performed at 150 mm KCl. For mass spectrometry analyses, the antibodies were cross-linked to the beads with 25 mm dimethyl pimelimidate in 0.2 m triethanolamine, pH 8.2. The conditions and substrates to assay for full-round (33Cruz-Reyes J. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 424: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and precleaved (1Carnes J. Stuart K.D. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 424: 25-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) editing were as described. Photoreactive substrates containing a single thio-U and 32P at the editing site were prepared (33Cruz-Reyes J. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 424: 107-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 34Sacharidou A. Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Hernandez A. Dangott L.J. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. RNA. 2006; 12: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and gRNA labeling was performed as reported (35Blum B. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 62: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). RNA helicase assays used a dsRNA substrate consisting of the pre-mRNA fragment A6-tag annealed to the cognate gRNA gA6[14] (9Seiwert S.D. Stuart K. Science. 1994; 266: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylated mRNA was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with a 10-fold excess of gRNA in RNA folding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm EDTA) by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by a gradual return to room temperature over the course of 2 h. The annealed form was purified by native gel electrophoresis in an 8% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE supplemented with 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. The standard RNA helicase assay consisted of 50 cps (∼10 fmol) of dsRNA in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 22 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 1 mm ATP, 50 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, a 20-fold excess of an unlabeled trap single strand RNA that complements ∼33 bp of gRNA, and 10 μl of beads in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated for 30–60 min at 26 °C with constant flicking to mix the beads. This was followed by addition of 4 μl of 6× stop solution as follows: 0.12% xylene cyanol, 0.12% bromphenol blue, 3% SDS, 125 ng/μl proteinase K, 17% glycerol, and incubation was at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were then loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel, 1× TBE supplemented with 10 mm Mg(OAc)2. Protein RNA photocross-linking was performed as described (34Sacharidou A. Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Hernandez A. Dangott L.J. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. RNA. 2006; 12: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) except that it was scaled up 10-fold. Denaturation of complexes was accomplished by the addition of SDS to 1% final and sequential incubations at 95 °C for 10 min and at 70 °C for 30–60 min. After allowing the sample to reach room temperature, Triton-X-100 was added to 5% and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then passed through a gel filtration spin column (Bio-spin 6, Bio-Rad 732 6221) according to the manufacturer's instructions and immunoprecipitated as above. Samples coupled to Dynabeads were treated with the following nucleases as indicated in the text at the given final concentration: RNase A (0.1 unit/μl), T1 (0.125 unit/μl), V1 (0.001/μl), and micrococcal nuclease (0.03 unit/μl) for 60 min in ice. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were resuspended in digestion buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 8 m urea) and digested by the sequential addition of Lys-C and trypsin proteases as described previously (36Florens L. Carozza M.J. Swanson S.K. Fournier M. Coleman M.K. Workman J.L. Washburn M.P. Methods. 2006; 40: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Digested samples were fractionated using a five-step on-line separation method during which peptides were eluted directly into an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) in which tandem mass spectra were collected (37Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates 3rd, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar, 38Wohlschlegel J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 497: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Wolters D.A. Washburn M.P. Yates 3rd, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). SEQUEST and DTASelect algorithms were used to identify peptide sequences from tandem mass spectra (40Eng J. McCormack A. Yates J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5315) Google Scholar, 41Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). Proteins were considered present in a sample if at least two peptides were identified per protein using a peptide level false-positive rate of 5% as determined using a decoy data base strategy (42Elias J.E. Gygi S.P. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Detailed protocols and oligonucleotide sequences used during this work are available upon request. In a mass spectrometric analysis of native editing complexes purified from T. brucei mitochondria, we detected multiple unique peptides of most RECC subunits and the accessory MRP factors (6Hernandez A. Panigrahi A. Cifuentes-Rojas C. Sacharidou A. Stuart K. Cruz-Reyes J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, we also found a single peptide for a 241-kDa protein, termed REH2, with highly conserved DExH-helicase domains, a dsRBD, and an N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses clearly detected an ∼250-kDa protein in native but not in TAP-isolated editing complexes (Fig. 1B), although a weak signal was apparent in TAP-REL1 complexes (see the middle panel). This suggested a transient interaction of REH2 with RECC that is disrupted during high stringency affinity purifications. Silver staining of native editing complexes did not evidently detect components near 250 kDa suggesting that REH2 may be substoichiometric relative to RECC subunits (Fig. 1C). To confirm the physical interaction of REH2 with editing subunits, we expressed in procyclic trypanosomes the complete 6504-nucleotide REH2 gene with a C-terminal TAP tag (31Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Séraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar) under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (Fig. 2A). REH2 mRNA and protein increased 5- and 2–3-fold, respectively, at day 3 of induction (Fig. 2, B and C), and a slight reduction in cell growth was seen at day 5 (Fig. 2D). Consistent with its predicted mitochondrial localization (supplemental Fig. S1), REH2 was enriched in a mitochondrial lysate (Fig. 2E) (43McManus M.T. Shimamura M. Grams J. Hajduk S.L. RNA. 2001; 7: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). REH2 antibodies reacted well with purified native editing complexes and mitochondrial lysates but weakly with TAP pulldowns due to a partial occlusion of the tag and consequent low purification efficiency from mitochondrial lysates. A small amount of RECC was detected in both TEV (Fig. 3A) and concentrated EGTA eluates (Fig. 3B) but not in mock pulldowns from empty vector control cells (last lane in each panel). Interestingly, this low level of RECC in the eluates was resistant to a pretreatment with RNases A and T1 and micrococcal nuclease (MN). In a converse approach, REH2 was detected in mitochondrial extract pulldowns of several RECC subunits (Fig. 3C). Also, REH2 antibodies immunoprecipitated a small fraction of preisolated native editing complexes after an extensive RNase-MN treatment including the dsRNA-specific RNase V1. However, most RECC remained in the unbound fraction (Fig. 3D), suggesting that relatively few purified complexes were stably bound to REH2.FIGURE 3REH2 co-purification with RECC is largely sensitive to extensive nuclease treatments. REH2 TAP purification and detection of editing subunits before or after (+/−) treatments with RNases A, T1 (and V1 as indicated), and micrococcal nuclease (MN). A, TEV (T) eluates from IgG-Sepharose. B, EGTA (ET) eluates from calmodulin-agarose. Control lanes include native editing complex (N), diluted whole-cell lysate (L) and empty-vector controls (TE or ETE; last lane). EGTA eluates were concentrated by acetone precipitation. Immunoblots of REH2 and editing subunits and auto-adenylylation of REL ligases are shown. ATPases in whole-cell lysates often inhibit the latter activity (e.g. A, lane 2). MP63 may co-migrate with antibody cross-reacting bovine serum albumin added as precipitation carrier (see the ETE control lane). REH2 fragmentation (*) is observed in the eluates. C, mitochondrial lysate immunoprecipitated (IP) pulldowns with antibodies to RECC subunits (MP81, MP63, REL1, and MP42) or a mock reaction without antibodies. D, REH2 pulldowns from purified native editing complexes. E, REH2 pulldowns from mitochondrial (M) lysate (Mito lysate). Mock reactions used pre-immune serum. An unaccounted band near MP52 is visible in the lysate lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Besides the above examination of affinity-purified eluates and isolated native editing complexes, we further analyzed the REH2/RECC association in mitochondrial lysates. Importantly, although RECC subunits were present in nuclease-treated REH2 pulldowns, most RECC was released by the treatment (Fig. 3E). This suggests that the transient association observed is largely mediated by RNA. Also, in line with transient contacts, REH2 purifications exhibited some precleaved but not full-round editing activity, which is less sensitive due to a limiting cleavage step (supplemental Fig. S2). Sedimentation analyses of mitochondrial lysates showed significant heterodispersion of REH2 with a broad peak at ∼20–30 S. Western blots of these fractions with REH2 antibodies and the peroxidase anti-peroxidase reagent (to score ectopic REH2 only) showed that the tag does not affect the sedimentation of REH2 (Fig. 4A, top and middle panels). The RECC subunit MP63 was also dispersed, but in contrast to REH2 it was not detected in light fractions (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). Interestingly, REH2 at ∼20 S and >40 S co-immunopurified with RECC subunits (see Fig. 4D). A pretreatment of the mitochondrial lysate with RNases/MN disrupted most high S value REH2 complexes generating a discrete peak at ∼15 S, whereas a significantly sharpened peak of editing complexes remained at ∼20 S (Fig. 4B). As described above, RNase treatment eliminated most REH2 association with RECC (Fig. 3E). To examine the relevance of the conserved dsRBD, we expressed a construct with a deletion of the entire motif (dsRBD-Δ) (see supplemental Fig. S3). Notably, this construct severely compromised cell growth (Fig. 2D) and reduced the sedimentation of both endogenous and ectopic REH2 to an extent comparable with the RNase treatment (Fig. 4C). Finally, we established that DNA does not largely contribute to the observed broad sedimentation of REH2 in a sample treated with DNase (“Experimental Procedures”; data not shown). Thus, REH2 forms heterodisperse particles that include editing complexes and are stabilized by RNA and the dsRBD, as well as relatively low density particles that resist RNase. Weng et al. (23Weng J. Aphasizheva I. Etheridge R.D. Huang L. Wang X. Falick A.M. Aphasizhev R. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 198-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) recently reported that GRBC complexes, which co-purified with REH2, bind gRNA. We determined whether REH2 immunopurified complexes associate with gRNA, and we further examined the importance of conserved domains of this protein. To this end, we analyzed IgG-Dynabead pulldowns of ectopically expressed REH2 wild type and mutant dsRBD-Δ or motif I (GK-to-AQ) (Fig. 1A). The motif I mutated residues have been associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis in other DExH proteins (44Jankowsky E. Nature. 2007; 449: 999-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although a significant amount of total gRNA co-purified with wild-type REH2, little if any was associated with either mutant (Fig. 5, A and B). It is of interest, however, that relatively large RNA species accumulated in both mutants. Furthermore, as shown by Hashimi et al. (22Hashimi H. Cicová Z. Novotná L. Wen Y.Z. Lukes J. RNA. 2009; 15: 588-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), RNAi down-regulation of REH2 decreased the steady-state levels of gRNA (Fig. 5, C and D). Importantly, REH2 pulldowns from wild-type cells contained gRNA, demonstrating that endogenous REH2 RNPs bind gRNA and that this association is not an artifact of overexpression (Fig. 5, E and F). Thus, gRNA binding by REH2 RNPs requires the dsRBD and wild-type motif I of REH2. We examined the REH2 immunoprecipitated pulldown from mitochondrial extracts for possible RNA helicase activity and RNA photocross-linking. Notably, a model A6 pre-edited mRNA, preannealed with cognate gRNA, was efficiently unwound by the REH2 pulldown in a reaction requiring ATP hydrolysis at its β-γ phosphodiester linkage (Fig. 6A). Although the dsRNA substrate in these assays was gel-isolated, some dissociation is visible in input and mock lanes in the absence of REH2 complexes. A continuous duplex with 3′-overhangs was also unwound (Fig. 6B) but not an identical helix with 5′- or no overhangs (data not shown), consistent with the substrate specificity of the vast majority of SF2 RNA helicases with the exception of DEAD-box proteins (45Bleichert F. Baserga S.J. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 339-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Importantly, REH2 pulldowns from the dsRBD-Δ and motif I cell lines had no detectable unwinding activity (Fig. 6C). We analyzed the sedimentation distribution of this helicase activity relative to REH2 and the DEAD-box helicase REH1. Interestingly, most helicase activity sedimented in fractions containing REH2 but away from REH1, which localizes at the top of the gradient in fractions 1–3 (Fig. 6, D–F) (28Missel A. Souza A.E. Nörskau G. Göringer H.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4895-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An REH2 pulldown of fraction 8 exhibited unwinding activity (data not shown). Together with our above studies of REH2 mutants, these data suggest that REH2 is linked with the observed RNA helicase activity. To examine the possibility that REH2 may directly bind RNA, we cross-linked a protein fraction enriched in RECC (3Rusché L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4069-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) with the pre-mRNA/gRNA substrate described above but substituted with a photoreactive thio-U and 32P at the editing site (34Sacharidou A. Cifuentes-Rojas C. Halbig K. Hernandez A. Dangott L.J. De Nova-Ocampo M. Cruz-Reyes J. RNA. 2006; 12: 1219-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This protein fraction produced a cross-link at ∼250 kDa (Fig. 7A, lane 1) that was enriched in a pulldown with REH2 but not REL1 antibodies (lanes 2 and 3). Importantly, REH2 pulldowns of cross-linked reactions that were treated with SDS and increasing temperature to dissociate the RNPs further enriched the ∼250-kDa cross-link (Fig. 7A, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that the reacting protein is REH2. As a proof of concept for the above denaturation protocol (Fig. 7B), we isolated the RNA photocross-linked RECC subunits REL1 (lane 2) and reported MP63 (lane 3) (6Hernandez A. Panigrahi A.

Additional studies are needed to confirm that the ∼250-kDa cross-link represents direct binding by REH2, but these data suggest that REH2 contacts the RNA duplex near the photoreactive moiety in the model editing site (≤4 Å) (46Fabre A.

https://openalex.org/W2000708514,"Several species of wild raptors have been found in Eurasia infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1. Should HPAIV (H5N1) reach North America in migratory birds, species of raptors are at risk not only from environmental exposure, but also from consuming infected birds and carcasses. In this study we used American kestrels as a representative species of a North American raptor to examine the effects of HPAIV (H5N1) infection in terms of dose response, viral shedding, pathology, and survival. Our data showed that kestrels are highly susceptible to HPAIV (H5N1). All birds typically died or were euthanized due to severe neurologic disease within 4–5 days of inoculation and shed significant amounts of virus both orally and cloacally, regardless of dose administered. The most consistent microscopic lesions were necrosis in the brain and pancreas. This is the first experimental study of HPAIV infection in a North American raptor and highlights the potential risks to birds of prey if HPAIV (H5N1) is introduced into North America."
https://openalex.org/W2112638132,"The chaperone/usher system is one of the best characterized pathways for protein secretion and assembly of cell surface appendages in Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, this pathway is used for biogenesis of the P pilus, a key virulence factor used by uropathogenic Escherichia coli to adhere to the host urinary tract. The P pilus individual subunits bound to the periplasmic chaperone PapD are delivered to the outer membrane PapC usher, which serves as an assembly platform for subunit incorporation into the pilus and secretion of the pilus fiber to the cell surface. PapC forms a dimeric, twin pore complex, with each monomer composed of a 24-stranded transmembrane β-barrel channel, an internal plug domain that occludes the channel, and globular N- and C-terminal domains that are located in the periplasm. Here we have used planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology to characterize the pore properties of wild type PapC and domain deletion mutants for the first time. The wild type pore is closed most of the time but displays frequent short-lived transitions to various open states. In comparison, PapC mutants containing deletions of the plug domain, an α-helix that caps the plug domain, or the N- and C-terminal domains form channels with higher open probability but still exhibiting dynamic behavior. Removal of the plug domain results in a channel with extremely large conductance. These observations suggest that the plug gates the usher channel closed and that the periplasmic domains and α-helix function to modulate the gating activity of the PapC twin pore.

Some of these complexes also participate in the assembly of surface-exposed appendages, such as flagella and pili (fimbriae). One of the most thoroughly studied secretion systems is the chaperone/usher pathway, responsible for the biogenesis of a superfamily of virulence-associated surface structures, including P and type 1 pili (3.Sauer F.G. Remaut H. Hultgren S.J. Waksman G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These pili play essential roles in the pathogenesis of uropathogenic Escherichia coli by providing a tool for attachment of the bacteria to host urothelial cells (4.Sharon N.

P pili, encoded by the chromosomal pap gene cluster, are critical virulence factors for infection of the kidney by uropathogenic E. coli and the development of pyelonephritis. The P pilus is composed of multiple subunits of PapA, which form a rigid helical rod. A thin linear tip fibrillum is located at the distal end of the pilus and is made of four different subunits (PapK, PapF, PapE, and the adhesin PapG) that assemble in a precise order and stoichiometry (3.Sauer F.G. Remaut H. Hultgren S.J. Waksman G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1694: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The minor pilin, PapH, anchors the pilus rod to the cell surface (7.Båga M.

Curtiss 3rd, R. Microbes. Infect. 2000; 2: 1061-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Once in the periplasm, the subunits form binary complexes with the PapD chaperone. The details of the binding interaction between the chaperone and subunits were revealed by crystal structures of chaperone-subunit complexes (9.Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S.

The actual assembly of the subunits into a pilus and secretion of the pilus fiber to the cell surface is mediated by the OM usher, PapC (12.Norgren M. Båga M. Tennent J.M. Normark S. Mol. Microbiol. 1987; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The usher recruits chaperone-subunit complexes from the periplasm and provides a platform for polymerization of the subunits in a precise order (13.Saulino E.T. Thanassi D.G. Pinkner J.S. Hultgren S.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 14.Dodson K.W. Jacob-Dubuisson F. Striker R.T. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 3670-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The energy for pilus formation at the OM is thought to be provided by the polymerization itself, and the details of the interactions between subunits during the polymerization process are well understood (11.Zavialov A.V.

Science. 2008; 320: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, how the usher facilitates polymerization and how fiber growth is coupled to translocation are two currently unresolved questions. The PapC usher is a dimer where each monomer is composed of four domains: 1) a N-terminal periplasmic domain (∼135 residues), 2) a β-barrel domain (residues 135–640), 3) a plug domain (residues 257–332) located within the β-barrel domain, and 4) a periplasmic C-terminal domain (residues 641–809) (17.Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18.Capitani G. Eidam O. Grütter M.G.

Cell. 2008; 133: 640-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of the usher has been implicated in the recognition and initial binding of chaperone-subunit complexes (20.Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5321-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21.Nishiyama M. Horst R. Eidam O. Herrmann T. Ignatov O. Vetsch M. Bettendorff P. Jelesarov I. Grütter M.G. Wüthrich K. Glockshuber R. Capitani G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2075-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain participates in the binding of chaperone-subunit complexes and is required for further assembly (17.Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22.So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A major breakthrough in our understanding of the chaperone/usher system came with the elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of the usher translocation channel (19.Remaut H. Tang C. Henderson N.S. Pinkner J.S. Wang T. Hultgren S.J. Thanassi D.G. Waksman G. Li H. Cell. 2008; 133: 640-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a 55-kDa fragment corresponding to the predicted transmembrane domain (residues 130–640) revealed that the pore is a kidney-shaped β-barrel of 24 strands (see Fig. 1A, blue), the largest number of strands identified for OM proteins so far. The inner dimensions of the pore are extremely large (25 × 45 Å), and it is likely that a gaping pore of such dimensions would be deleterious to the cell. Thus, not surprisingly, the pore is occupied by a plug domain, formed by the region between strands β6 and β7, which adopts a six-stranded β sandwich fold (see Fig. 1A, orange). The plug domain appears to be held in place by a hairpin loop between strands β5 and β6 (see Fig. 1A, magenta). Finally, another salient feature of the PapC pore is the presence of an α-helix (residues 448–465) that interacts with the β5–6 hairpin and is positioned over the hairpin and plug domain on the extracellular side of the barrel lumen (see Fig. 1A, aqua). There is evidence that PapC indeed functions as a dimer during pilus biogenesis. PapC was shown to assemble as a dimeric twin pore complex in the lipid bilayer by cryo-EM (23.Li H. Qian L. Chen Z. Thibault D. Liu G. Liu T. Thanassi D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and in solution by crystallography (19.Remaut H. Tang C. Henderson N.S.

In addition, complementation of defective PapC mutants was achieved by expression of the homologous FimD usher used in type 1 pilus biogenesis (17.Thanassi D.G. Stathopoulos C. Dodson K. Geiger D. Hultgren S.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6260-6269Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22.So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and PapC-FimD interactions were demonstrated (22.So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, a type 1 pilus intermediate was isolated, and a snapshot of the pilus biogenesis process was captured by cryo-EM of this complex (19.Remaut H. Tang C. Henderson N.S. Pinkner J.S. Wang T. Hultgren S.J. Thanassi D.G. Waksman G. Li H. Cell. 2008; 133: 640-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The images revealed electron densities for the FimD usher that corresponded to the crystal structure of the PapC dimer. In addition, the images revealed that the assembling pilus fiber appears to utilize only one of the usher monomers for secretion. Based on the structural and biochemical information obtained so far on both the P pilus and the type 1 pilus systems, a model for pilus assembly at the usher was presented (19.Remaut H. Tang C. Henderson N.S. Pinkner J.S. Wang T. Hultgren S.J. Thanassi D.G. Waksman G. Li H. Cell. 2008; 133: 640-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) whereby the periplasmic N-terminal domains of both usher monomers alternate in delivering the subunits to an assembly platform provided by the usher dimer, whereas translocation through the OM occurs via a single pore. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of the usher during pilus assembly and secretion, we have initiated an electrophysiological analysis of the pore function of PapC. Here we used the planar lipid bilayer technique to investigate the channel properties of the PapC usher and some of its mutants. The comparison of the functional properties of the wild type and mutant proteins allowed us to gain insight into the role of various domains in the basal activity of the usher channel and set the stage for using electrophysiology as a functional assay for secretion. Dodecyl-maltopyranoside and lauryl(dimethyl)amine oxide were purchased from Anatrace, and N-octyl-oligo-oxyethylene was from Axxora. Thrombin was from Novagen. The pentane and hexadecane used in planar lipid bilayer experiments were from Burdick and Jackson and TCI, respectively. Other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisher. E. coli strains DH5α (24.Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) and the multi-porin mutant BL21(DE3)Omp8 (25.Prilipov A. Phale P.S. Van Gelder P. Rosenbusch J.P. Koebnik R. FEMS. Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for plasmid construction and PapC purification, respectively. Bacteria were grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with aeration. For protein expression, PapC was induced at an A600 of 0.6 for 2–2.5 h by the addition of 0.1% l-arabinose. Plasmid pDG2 encoding wild type PapC with a thrombin cleavage site and a His6 tag added to the C terminus was previously described (23.Li H. Qian L. Chen Z. Thibault D. Liu G. Liu T. Thanassi D.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1397-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). New plasmids were constructed from pDG2 to engineer the various mutations. A detailed description of the strategies and the primer sequences are given in supplemental Fig. S1. All of the PapC mutants were checked for proper construction by DNA sequencing. The OM fraction from bacteria induced for expression of one of the PapC constructs was isolated by French press disruption and Sarkosyl extraction, as described (22.So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The OM was solubilized by resuspending into 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.12 m NaCl, and 1% dodecyl-maltopyranoside and rocking overnight at 4 °C. The extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), imadazole was added to 20 mm to the supernatant fraction, and this fraction was run over a nickel affinity column (HisTrap; GE Healthcare) using an Akta fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (GE Healthcare). The bound PapC protein was eluted using an imidazole step gradient in buffer A, which is 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.12 m NaCl, and 10 mm lauryl(dimethyl)amine oxide. Fractions containing PapC were pooled, and the His6 tag was cleaved off PapC by overnight digestion at room temperature with 1.5 units of thrombin/mg of PapC while dialyzing against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 0.12 m NaCl. The thrombin was inhibited by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the mixture was subjected to a second round of nickel affinity chromatography in buffer A. In this case, the thrombin-cleaved PapC came off the column in the flow-through fraction. The collected flow-through material was concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal concentrator (molecular mass cut-off, 50 kDa) and applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in buffer A. The peak fraction containing PapC was collected from the gel filtration column and concentrated using the centrifugal concentrator as described above. Purified protein was stored frozen in aliquots. Each of the PapC mutant constructs was compared with the wild type PapC for expression level in the OM by immunoblotting with anti-His6 tag (Convance) or anti-PapC antibodies. Proper folding of the PapC constructs in the OM was checked by resistance to denaturation by SDS, as determined by heat-modifiable mobility on SDS-PAGE. These procedures were performed as described (20.Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5321-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22.So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ability of each of the PapC mutants to complement a ΔpapC pap operon for assembly of P pili was determined by hemagglutination assay and purification of pili from the bacterial surface as described (22.So S.S. Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The release of pilus subunits into culture supernatant fractions was analyzed as follows. Bacteria expressing WT PapC or one of the PapC mutants together with a ΔpapC pap operon as described above were grown to mid-log phase and placed on ice. Five ml of each culture was centrifuged (3,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to separate the bacteria from the culture supernatant. The supernatant was removed to a new tube, centrifuged again (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore) to remove any remaining bacteria. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris (8.0), and an aliquot of the resuspended bacteria was mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. The cell-free culture supernatant was precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid and incubation on ice for 30 min. The precipitate was pelleted (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), washed twice with acetone, resuspended in 100 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 10 min. Twelve μl of the whole bacterial sample (representing 0.06 ml of the original culture) and 5 μl of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated culture supernatant (representing 0.5 ml of the original culture) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and chaperone-subunit complexes were detected by immunoblotting with anti-PapDG or anti-PapDE antibodies. A 100-μm-diameter hole was formed in a 0.01-mm-thick Teflon film and pretreated with a 1% solution of hexadecane in pentane. The Teflon film was sandwiched between two Teflon chambers filled with 1.5 ml of 1 m KCl, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2). Fifty μg of soybean phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine Type II-S; Sigma) in pentane (5 mg/ml) were added to both chambers. A lipid bilayer was formed over the hole by lowering and raising the level of buffer in one chamber. An aliquot of pure protein was added to one chamber only (cis-side), from a 5–100-fold dilution of the purified protein (0.3- 0.6 mg/ml) in a 1% N-octyl-oligo-oxyethylene solution in the 1 m KCl buffer. If no spontaneous insertion of channels occurred within 10 min, the membrane was broken and formed again, and/or more protein was added. The amount of protein added varied considerably depending on the success of insertion (10–7,000 ng added to the chamber). Currents were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions with an Axopatch 1D amplifier connected to a CV-4B headstage (Axon Instruments). The voltages given are those of the cis-compartment with respect to the trans compartment (ground). The currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized every 100 μs (Instrutech). The data were stored on a PC computer using the Acquire software (Bruxton) and analyzed with pClamp. We constructed a series of mutations in PapC to investigate the roles of major domains and features in pilus biogenesis and channel function. The following regions were deleted either alone or in combination (Fig. 1B): the N- and C-terminal domains (ΔNΔC), the plug domain (Δplug), the β5–6 hairpin that interacts with the plug (Δhairpin), and the α-helix that caps the hairpin (Δhelix). The PapC ΔNΔC mutant corresponds to the usher translocation domain for which the structure was recently determined (Fig. 1A) (19.Remaut H. Tang C. Henderson N.S. Pinkner J.S. Wang T. Hultgren S.J. Thanassi D.G. Waksman G. Li H. Cell. 2008; 133: 640-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Each of the PapC mutants was compared with the wild type protein for expression level in the OM and resistance to denaturation by SDS, which provides an indication of proper folding and stability of the β-barrel domain (26.Sugawara E. Steiert M. Rouhani S. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6067-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β5–6 hairpin appears to be important for the overall stability of the usher, because the expression levels of the Δhairpin mutant and a combined ΔhairpinΔhelix mutant in the OM were very low (Table 1). In addition, a triple mutant deleted for the N- and C-terminal domains and the plug domain (ΔNΔCΔplug) had very low expression and no longer exhibited SDS resistance (Table 1), indicating that the combined absence of these three domains prevents proper folding of the usher in the OM.

As expected based on previous studies (20.Ng T.W. Akman L. Osisami M. Thanassi D.G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5321-5331Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21.Nishiyama M. Horst R. Eidam O.

Thanassi D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 364-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), deletion of the N- and C-terminal domains abolished the ability of the usher to assemble pili. The Δplug mutant was also unable to assemble pili, demonstrating an essential functional role for this domain. In contrast, the mutation affecting the β5–6 hairpin (Δhairpin) had only mild effects on pilus biogenesis, and the Δhelix mutant behaved essentially as WT (Table 1). However, the combined ΔhelixΔhairpin mutant was completely defective for assembly on the bacterial surface. The ability of the Δhairpin mutant to assemble pili was surprising giving its low expression level (Table 1). This mutant may be stabilized by interactions with chaperone-subunit complexes and the assembling pilus fiber. Although the ΔNΔC, Δplug, and ΔhelixΔhairpin PapC mutants were unable to assemble pili on the bacterial surface, these mutants, particularly Δplug, might allow release of unassembled pilus subunits into the extracellular milieu. However, comparison of culture supernatant fractions from bacteria expressing WT PapC or one of the deletion mutants together with a ΔpapC pap operon did not show increased release of pilus subunits (data not shown). The channel properties of purified wild type and mutant PapC proteins were investigated with the planar lipid bilayer technique. The Δhairpin, ΔhairpinΔhelix, and the ΔNΔCΔplug mutants were not analyzed for channel formation because of their effects on protein stability and/or expression. In the planar lipid bilayer technique, a phospholipid bilayer is formed over a 100-μm-diameter hole in a Teflon film separating two buffer-filled chambers, and an aliquot of purified protein in detergent is added to one chamber only (the cis-side). Gentle stirring of the chamber promotes the spontaneous insertion of single pore-forming protein. Under voltage-clamp conditions, such insertion events are typically witnessed by a change in the amount of current passing through the bilayer and a change in the pattern of current fluctuations. Some proteins are more prone to rapid insertion; the E. coli porin OmpF, for example, inserts within a few minutes. We found that the wild type and mutant PapC proteins were relatively reluctant to insertion. An allowance of up to 10 min was set for insertions, and often several attempts were necessary, even with amounts 7,000 times larger than those typically used for OmpF porin (∼1 ng). We attribute this intrinsic reluctance to the complex structural organization of the usher protein, with two subunits comprising a 24-stranded β-barrel domain and large N- and C-terminal domains. Despite this technical difficulty, we were able to obtain multiple recordings of each protein investigated here. We have not yet been able to experimentally determine the orientation of the inserted proteins, but we assume that the protein inserts with the extracellular side going in first, because it is unlikely that the hydrophilic N- and C-terminal domains would be able to go through the bilayer. Fig. 2 shows typical recordings of the spontaneous activity of the wild type PapC and the ΔNΔC, Δplug, and Δhelix mutants. The recordings were made in buffer containing 1 m KCl, which is a typical composition for the initial characterization of pore-forming proteins when using this technique, because it stabilizes the membrane and provides a good signal-to-noise ratio because of the large currents at high ionic concentration. The four protein types have very distinct kinetic signatures, which were found repeatedly in different experiments (>15 for wild type PapC, 5 for ΔNΔC, 9 for Δplug, and 8 for Δhelix). The fact that each protein has a characteristic activity pattern underscores that the observed activity is not artifactual and does not originate from the instability of the membrane. All four channels show spontaneous opening and closing transitions that are seen as spiky deflections of the current traces. These recordings were made at a clamped potential of −30 mV, and by convention openings are shown as downward spikes (marked by the downward arrows in Fig. 2, A and B). It is noteworthy that, in the same conditions, the Δplug channel passes a huge amount of current, with a maximum current level of several hundreds of pA at this relatively low voltage (for comparison, the current passing through the three channels of a trimeric OmpF porin is about 120 pA at 30 mV) (27.Baslé A. Iyer R. Delcour A.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1664: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In fact, we found that we need to maintain the membrane potential below 50 mV and limit the recordings to no more than 30 s to avoid difficulties in clamping the membrane potential. The Δhelix channel shows bursts of activity comparable with that of the Δplug channel, although the size of the events is smaller. Another remarkable trait is that none of these channels is either completely closed or completely open, as might have been expected for the wild type and Δplug PapC, respectively, and all show a substantial amount of dynamic behavior. In the text below, we describe the activities in further detail. The trace in Fig. 2A shows that the current through the wild type channel remains at a base-line level that is close to the zero current level but displays frequent short-lived transitions to open states of va"
https://openalex.org/W2098447055,"Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are members of the MAPK family and participate in the transduction of stimuli in cellular responses. Their long-term actions are accomplished by promoting the expression of specific genes whereas faster responses are achieved by direct phosphorylation of downstream effectors located throughout the cell. In this study we determined that hERK1 translocates to the mitochondria of HeLa cells upon a proliferative stimulus. In the mitochondrial environment, hERK1 physically associates with (i) at least 5 mitochondrial proteins with functions related to transport (i.e. VDAC1), signalling, and metabolism; (ii) histones H2A and H4; and (iii) other cytosolic proteins. This work indicates for the first time the presence of diverse ERK-complexes in mitochondria and thus provides a new perspective for assessing the functions of ERK1 in the regulation of cellular signalling and trafficking in HeLa cells."

The cleavage products could be reproduced by incubation of the antibody with H2O2 and featured complementary ladders of the C- and N-terminal residues (Asp226–Lys227–Thr228–His229–Thr230) in the heavy chain of the Fab domain and the upper hinge of one of the Fc domains, respectively. Two adducts of +45 and +71 Da were also observed at the N-terminal residues of some Fc fragments and were identified as isocyanate and α-ketoacyl derivatives generated by radical cleavage at the α-carbon position through the diamide and α-amidation pathways. We determined that the hinge cleavage was initiated by radical-induced breakage of the disulfide bond between the two hinge cysteines at position 231 (Cys231-Pro-Pro-Cys-Pro), followed by the formation of a thiyl radical (Cys231-S•) on one cysteine and sulfenic acid (Cys231-SOH) on the other. The location of the initial radical attack and the critical role of Cys231 were demonstrated by the observation that 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide only reacted with the Cys231 radical and completely blocked hinge cleavage, suggesting the necessity of an electron/radical transfer from the Cys231 radical to the hinge residues where cleavage was observed.

These observations were further supported by a more recent observation that the light chains (three κ and three λ types) from the urine of six patients who had multiple myeloma and light chain proteinuria were found capable of generating H2O2 (13.Wang P.X.

It has been demonstrated that H2O2-mediated redox chemistry can regulate the biological function of proteins through interactions with specific residues such as cysteine (Cys) (20.Stamler J.S. Hausladen A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21.Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D.

Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) have proposed a continuum of H2O2-mediated Cys–SH modifications that constitute important biological signaling events on the one hand and irreversible hallmarks of oxidative stress on the other. Quite commonly, Cys–SH reacts with H2O2 and yields oxidized forms of reversible or irreversible modified residues; reversible modified groups can be stabilized within the protein environment and recycled (21.Salmeen A.

Irreversible oxidation can lead to the degradation of proteins via a hydroxyl radical mediated mechanism to cleave a peptide bond at the α-carbon position through either the diamide or α-amidation pathways (24.Garrison W.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 381-398Crossref Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 25.Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Amino Acids. 2003; 25: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 26.Berlett B.S.

Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 50-120Google Scholar). Although extensive studies have been conducted, because of the transient nature of a radical reaction and unstable intermediate products, the mechanisms underlying the formation of some specific reaction products is still not fully understood. It is well known that Cys residues of an IgG molecule form the intrachain or interchain disulfide bonds (1.Carter P.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 5.Jefferis R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar); thus, the effect of H2O2-mediated Cys redox chemistry on the structure and stability of a human antibody remains unclear. A lot of the trace reactions involving H2O2 in vivo are also believed to occur in cell-based cell culture systems, and there is convincing evidence linking them to the same pathways of either H2O2 generation or H2O2-mediated cellular signaling (28.Shen H.M. Pervaiz S. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1589-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29.Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7412) Google Scholar, 30.Martindale J.L.

Most recombinant mAb are produced by large scale bioreactor cell cultures in three principal mammalian cell lines, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and murine myeloma lines SP2/0 and NS0. The bioreactor cell culture is the industrial standard platform for the production of the mAbs, where the conditions mimic the physiological environment, providing in vivo-like conditions. Here, we describe the degradation of a recombinant human IgG1 antibody that was purified from CHO cells cultured in a bioreactor, and we present evidence for a specific H2O2-mediated radical cleavage in the hinge region of the antibody. The cleavage led to the loss of one Fab domain and a heavily oxidized partial molecule. The mechanism for the formation of this partial molecule could be mimicked by H2O2 treatment of the intact IgG1, which resulted in the breakage of the first interchain disulfide bond in the hinge region and the formation of sulfenic acid (Cys231–SOH) on one cysteine and a thiyl radical (Cys231–S•) on the other. The thiyl radical initializes an electron transfer/radical transfer to the hinge residues, which gives rise to backbone cleavage on a one radical cleavage per molecule basis to generate one free Fab domain fragment with a ladder of the C-terminal heavy chain residues complementary to the N-terminal ladder of one of the heavy chains of the Fc domain in the truncated IgG1 mAb. We propose that the observed sequential hinge cleavage of an IgG1 resulted from a hydroxyl radical reaction mechanism. The antibody used in this study is a recombinant fully human antibody of the IgG1 subclass. The molecule was expressed in CHO cells and chromatographically purified using conventional techniques, including protein A, cation-exchange chromatography, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (31.Shukla A.A. Hubbard B. Tressel T. Guhan S. Low D. J. Chromatogr. B. 2007; 848: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The partial antibody was separated by SEC on a TSK G3000SWxl dual column (Tosoh Bioscience LLC, Montgomeryville, PA), 7.8 × 300 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Eluting protein was monitored at 220 nm. The SEC running buffer contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.8. The cleavage was measured by the relative percentage of integrated peak area of partial molecules (C1 and C2, see text for details). SEC fractionation was carried out on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a fraction collector. Purified fractions were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation in Millipore Centriprep YM-30 filter units with a 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The above procedure was repeated as necessary to ensure greater than 95% fraction purity. A reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 10 mg of IgG1 antibody in a buffer containing 10 mm glutamic acid at pH 5.2 was incubated at 25 °C with 20 mm H2O2. To remove H2O2, the samples were buffer-exchanged by centrifugation in filter units as described above. Purified partial molecules were reduced and alkylated as described previously (31.Shukla A.A. Hubbard B. Tressel T. Guhan S. Low D. J. Chromatogr. B. 2007; 848: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Briefly, antibody was diluted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (Sigma), with a final concentration of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (Mallinckrodt, Hazelwood, MO). A 0.5 m dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma) stock solution was added to give a final concentration of 5 mm, and the reaction mixture was placed for 30 min at 55 °C. The protein solution was cooled to room temperature, and a 0.5 m iodoacetamide (IAM, Sigma) stock solution was added to reach a final concentration of 15 mm IAM. The alkylation was performed at room temperature for 40 min in the dark. Then, a 0.5 m DTT stock solution was added to obtain a final concentration of 15 mm DTT to quench the alkylation. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed on an Agilent 1200 HPLC system. The mobile phase included water with 0.11% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile (Honeywell Burdick & Jackson) with 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid as solvent B. An Agilent Zorbax SB300 C8 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), 2.1 × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size column was used for the RP-HPLC time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. The column eluent was analyzed by UV detection at 214 nm and then directed in-line to a TOF mass spectrometer. The initial mobile phase was 25% solvent B for 5 min, and then a two-stage gradient was applied of 1.4% solvent B per min from 25 to 32% solvent B, followed by a second gradient of 0.24% solvent B per min from 32 to 38% solvent B. The separation was performed at 75 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Peak areas were calculated using ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) by applying a tangent skimming technique for the integration of incompletely resolved peaks. Electrospray ionization TOF/MS was performed on an Agilent 6210 liquid chromatography-TOF/MS spectrometer equipped with an Agilent 1200 HPLC system. The electrospray ionization-TOF/MS system was set to run in positive ion mode with a capillary voltage of 5,000 V, and an m/z range of 50–3,500. The electrospray ionization mass spectra were analyzed using Agilent BioConfirm protein deconvolution software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Prior to digestion, samples were buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant proteomics grade trypsin (Roche Applied Science), or sequencing grade Lys-C or Asp-N (Roche Applied Science) was added to samples at an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w). Digestion occurred for 4 h at 37 °C for which aliquots at different time points were frozen away at −20 °C until analysis. In some cases, prior to reduction and alkylation, any unpaired cysteine residues were blocked by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) according to Martinez et al. (33.Martinez T. Guo A. Allen M.J. Han M. Pace D. Jones J. Gillespie R. Ketchem R.R. Zhang Y. Balland A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7496-7508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Analytical peptide maps consisted of loading 50 μg of the digest onto a Phenomenex Jupiter Proteo C12 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA), 2.0 × 250 mm, 4-μm particle size, 90-Å pore size column, heated to a temperature of 60 °C. The separation was performed by gradient elution on an Agilent HP 1200 HPLC system. The column was held at the initial condition of 0.5% solvent A (0.11% trifluoroacetic acid in water) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min for 5 min, and the digest was then eluted with a linear gradient to 60% solvent B (0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 160 min. Peptides were identified by data-dependent MS2 and MS3 fragmentation using a Thermo LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). We evaluated the heterogeneity of a recombinant human IgG1 mAb by measuring its apparent size using SEC. The SEC profile was characterized by a homogeneous major peak eluting between 32 and 33 min and two minor peaks eluting at 27 and 34.5 min, respectively (Fig. 1A). The minor peak with the retention time of 34.5 min represented a smaller size, partial molecule (Fig. 1A, P1). This minor heterogeneity could not be explained by variation in glycosylation, as deglycosylation of the IgG1 did not affect the SEC profile. The heterogeneous SEC profile of the IgG1 was consistent between lots and found in other IgG1 molecules (data not shown), suggesting that the formation of this partial form is inherent in the nature of the IgG1 mAb or the cell culture production process or both. To further study this partial molecule (P1), SEC was used to separate and enrich P1 to a purity of greater than 95% according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified P1 was reduced with 5 mm DTT, alkylated with 15 mm IAM, and then subjected to RP-HPLC-TOF/MS analysis. The results showed that P1 was a heavily oxidized partial molecule, which was lacking one of the Fab domains and contained a truncated Fc domain, in which one of the Fc domain heavy chains (Fc-HC) were characterized by a unique N-terminal ladder consisting of the hinge residues DKTHT (Table 1 and Fig. 2).TABLE 1The average masses of the P1 and C1 fragments generated by DTT reduction and IAM alkylation, followed by RP-HPLC-TOF/MS analysisPeakResidues (start to end)Theoretical massObserved massMass differenceAssignmentDaDaDaIgG1LC1Glu1–Cys21523,679.323,678.5−0.8HC2pE1–Gly45151,373.9 (G0)51,373.9 (G0)0.0P1Fc1Thr228–Gly45126,997.6 (G0)27,029.3 (G0)31.72 OLys227–Gly45127,125.5 (G0)27,156.6 (G0)31.12 OAsp226–Gly45127,240.6 (G0)27,270.6 (G0)30.02 OAsp226–Gly45127,240.6 (G0)27,315.9 (G0)75.345 Da adduct +2 OAsp226–Gly45127,402.7 (G1)27,433.4 (G1)30.72 O2Thr230–Gly45126,759.4 (G0)26,774.5 (G0)15.11 OThr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)26,937.1 (G1)15.51 OThr228–Gly45126,997.6 (G0)26,996.2 (G0)−1.4Thr228–Gly45127,159.8 (G1)27,158.8 (G1)−1.13Thr230–Gly45126,759.4 (G0)26,758.4 (G0)−1.0Thr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)26,920.0 (G1)−1.6Thr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)26,993.7 (G1)72.171-Da adductThr230–Gly45127,083.8 (G2)27,082.1 (G2)−1.7Thr230–Gly45126,759.4 (G0)26,774.9 (G0)15.51 OThr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)26,937.1 (G1)15.51 OLC4Glu1–Cys21523,679.323,710.030.72 O5Glu1–Cys21523,679.323,678.4−0.9HCpE1–Gly45151,373.9 (G0)51,420.5 (G0)46.63 OpE1–Gly45151,373.9 (G0)51,436.9 (G0)63.04 OpE1–Gly45151,373.9 (G0)51,453.6 (G0)79.75 OC1Fc1Thr228–Gly45126,997.6 (G0)27,045.2 (G0)47.63 OThr228–Gly45127,159.8 (G1)27,206.2 (G0)46.43 OLys227–Gly45127,125.5 (G0)27,172.5 (G0)47.03 OAsp226–Gly45127,240.6 (G0)27,288.1 (G0)47.53 OAsp226–Gly45127,240.6 (G0)27,334.4 (G0)93.845-Da adduct + 3 OAsp226–Gly45127,402.7 (G1)27,449.2 (G1)46.53 O2Thr230–Gly45126,759.4 (G0)26,806.6 (G0)47.23 OThr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)26,968.4 (G1)46.83 OThr228–Gly45126,997.6 (G0)27,014.9 (G0)17.31 OThr228–Gly45127,159.8 (G1)27,177.3 (G1)17.21 O3Thr230–Gly45126,759.4 (G0)26,776.8 (G0)17.41 OThr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)26,939.1 (G1)17.51 OThr230–Gly45126,759.4 (G0)26,877.9 (G0)118.671 Da adduct + 3 OThr230–Gly45126,921.6 (G1)27,040.0 (G1)118.471 Da adduct + 3 OLC4Glu1–Cys21523,679.323,709.830.52 O5Glu1–Cys21523,679.323,677.4−1.8HC6pE1–Gly45151,373.9 (G0)51,470.9 (G0)96.06 O7pE1–Gly45151,373.9 (G0)51,436.9 (G0)63.04 O Open table in a new tab H2O2 is widely produced in healthy cells (16.Rhee S.G.

Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar); thus, the formation of the partial IgG1 molecule P1 and its heavily oxidized nature may suggest the involvement of H2O2 from the cell culture production. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of H2O2 on the stability of the IgG1 and employed SEC to measure any potential degradation products. SEC analysis of an IgG1 sample with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml that was incubated at 25 °C for 8 h at pH 5.2 in the presence of less than 20 mm H2O2 did not detect any cleavage or other degradation products (data not shown). A H2O2 concentration of at least 20 mm, equal to a molar ratio of 1:300, was necessary to generate two smaller fragments (C1 and C2) with the retention times of 34.5 and 40 min, respectively (Fig. 1B). The fact that incubation for 21 days under the given conditions resulted in the time-dependent linear growth of only two distinct fragments (Fig. 1B), suggested that the cleavage reaction follows a specific mechanism. It was intriguing to observe that C1 and P1, originating from different preparations, elute with the same retention times. To investigate whether this phenomenon is possibly due to similar structural properties in regard to the nature and location of the cleavage, the IgG1 was incubated at 25 °C with H2O2, pH 5.2, for 2 and 6 weeks, and the generated C1 and C2 fragments were purified by SEC. The purified C1 and P1 samples were reduced by 5 mm DTT in the presence of 4 m guanidine hydrochloride, alkylated by 15 mm IAM, and analyzed by RP-HPLC-TOF/MS. Both C1 and P1 showed similar profiles that were composed of intact HC (peaks 6 and 7), intact LC (peaks 4 and 5), and a single truncated HC of the Fc domain (Fc-HC, peaks 1–3), whereas the untreated control contained only intact LC and HC (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The molar ratio of the three components, Fc-HC, LC, and HC, in P1 and C1 was estimated to be 1:1:1 according to the integrated UV peak area, indicating that P1 and C1 represent a partial antibody lacking one Fab domain. In addition, each Fc-HC showed a heterogeneous RP-HPLC profile with at least three components, a front peak (peak 1), middle peak (peak 2), and back peak (peak 3). TOF/MS analysis (Fig. 3) suggested that peaks 1–3 were derived from single Fc-HC fragments starting from different N-terminal upper hinge residues (Asp226, Lys227, Thr228, and Thr230) and ending at the C-terminal residue Gly451. These Fc-HC fragments composed the typical distribution of Fc glycan structures with various degrees of oxidation (Table 1). In addition, two adducts of +45 and +71 Da were observed on some Fc-HC fragments. These are not commonly observed adducts and are not consistent with known modifications. Mass analysis showed that peaks 4 and 5 for both P1 and C1 represented two LC components. One was consistent with the theoretical mass of intact LC (peak 5) and the other with oxidized intact LC because of a mass increase of 32 Da. Peaks 6 and 7 represented two HC components that were both oxidized. Peak 6 was characterized by molecular masses corresponding to a G0 glycan moiety (5.Jefferis R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar)-containing species, which were 48 and 96 Da heavier than the calculated mass, suggesting the presence of oxidation in the HC. The HC component represented by peak 7 included various degrees of oxidation (+16 Da (P1) and +64 Da (C1) (see Table 1 and supplemental material for more details). Analysis of C1 generated by a 6-week incubation at 25 °C in the presence of 20 mm H2O2, pH 5.2, demonstrated that longer H2O2 treatment did not result in the formation of new cleavage products but in a higher degree of the specific cleavage products C1 and C2 (see below) and higher oxidation levels, ∼25–40% for LC and ∼30–50% for HC (Fig. 2, data not shown), resulting from the oxidative condition induced by H2O2. Collectively, these results demonstrated that H2O2 was capable of inducing both oxidation of amino acid side chains and backbone fragmentation specifically in the IgG1 hinge region, and these results led us conclude that H2O2-induced hinge fragmentation is the likely cause for the formation of the partial IgG1 molecule P1 during cell culture. The inability of isolating the missing Fab domain fragment from the cell culture prevented further evaluation of its structural properties. However, the available C2 fragment derived from the SEC fractionation (Fig. 1B) allowed further investigation of the mechanism underlying H2O2-induced hinge fragmentation. To this end, RP-HPLC-TOF/MS analysis of reduced and alkylated C2 was conducted to determine the structural properties of this species (Fig. 4). The C2 was found to represent a heavily oxidized Fab domain fragment, composed of the LC components (Fig. 4A, peaks 1 and 2) and HC component, the Fab portion of the heavy chain of the fragment (Fig. 4A, peaks 3 and 4). Among the LC components, one was consistent with the mass of intact unmodified LC (peak 2) and the other with the mass of intact LC that is heavier by 32 Da (peak 1), suggesting oxidization (data not shown). The Fd components (peak 3 and 4) were found to be heavily oxidized as well, with either one (+16 Da, peak 4, Fig. 4C) or three (+48 Da, peak 3, Fig. 4B) additional oxygen atoms. Furthermore, both Fd components contained a ladder of the C-terminal upper hinge residues, Cys225, Asp226, Lys227, Thr228, His229, and Thr230 (see supplemental Table S1 for more details). Combining these results with the results from the C1 and P1 analyses, it seems that H2O2 treatment resulted in upper hinge cleavage, which generated two fragments (C1 and C2) with complementary ladders of the C-terminal HC residues in the Fab domain fragment (C2) and N-terminal HC residues in the Fc domain (Fig. 5, C1). Collectively, these results suggested that the partial IgG1 antibody component P1 could be a degradation product of H2O2-mediated hinge fragmentation generated by a specific cleavage mechanism.FIGURE 5Schematic illustration of the major cleavage sites in the IgG1. H2O2-mediated cleavage of the hinge region, as indicated by the arrows, resulted in the generation of complementary ladders of C- and N-terminal hinge residues (Asp226, Lys227, Thr228, His229, and Thr230) and the release of the C1 and C2 fragments via a one radical per molecule cleavage mechanism (see text for details). Solid lines indicate disulfide bonds.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The similar profiles and the same cleavage sites between the P1 and C1 suggested that the partial form that was purified from the bioreactor CHO cell culture could be mimicked in vitro by incubation of the molecule with H2O2. It has been shown that H2O2 can regulate the biological function of proteins through a radical-induced oxidation pathway. Hydroxyl radicals (HO•) can be generated from H2O2 and are involved in various chemical reactions that result in the degradation of proteins (20.Stamler J.S. Hausladen A. Nat. Struct.

Here we describe a large genetic isolate from the North West Apennines, the mountain range that runs through Italy from the North West Alps to the South. Methodology/Principal Findings The study involved 1,803 people living in 7 villages of the upper Borbera Valley. For this large population cohort, data from genealogy reconstruction, medical questionnaires, blood, anthropometric and bone status QUS parameters were evaluated. Demographic and epidemiological analyses indicated a substantial genetic component contributing to each trait variation as well as overlapping genetic determinants and family clustering for some traits. Conclusions/Significance The data provide evidence for significant heritability of medical relevant traits that will be important in mapping quantitative traits. We suggest that this population isolate is suitable to identify rare variants associated with complex phenotypes that may be difficult to study in larger but more heterogeneous populations."
https://openalex.org/W2160715592,"Recently, a few fish proteins have been described with a high homology to B-type lectins of monocotyledonous plants. Because of their mannose binding activity, they have been ascribed a role in innate immunity. By screening various fish venoms for their integrin inhibitory activity, we isolated a homologous protein from the fin stings and skin mucus of the scorpionfish (Scorpaena plumieri). This protein inhibits alpha1beta1 integrin binding to basement membrane collagen IV. By protein chemical and spectroscopic means, we demonstrated that this fish protein, called plumieribetin, is a homotetramer and contains a high content of anti-parallel beta strands, similar to the mannose-binding monocot B-lectins. It lacks both N-linked glycoconjugates and common O-glycan motifs. Despite its B-lectin-like structure, plumieribetin binds to alpha1beta1 integrin irrespective of N-glycosylation, suggesting a direct protein-protein interaction. This interaction is independent of divalent cations. On the cellular level, plumieribetin failed to completely detach hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells and primary arterial smooth muscle cells from the collagen IV fragment CB3. However, plumieribetin weakened the cell-collagen contacts, reduced cell spreading, and altered the actin cytoskeleton, after the compensating alpha2beta1 integrin was blocked. The integrin inhibiting effect of plumieribetin adds a new function to the B-lectin family, which is known for pathogen defense."
https://openalex.org/W2089426978,"The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E plays a critical role in the control of translation initiation through binding to the mRNA 5' cap structure. eIF4E is also a component of processing bodies and stress granules, which are two types of cytoplasmic RNA granule in which translationally inactivated mRNAs accumulate. We found that treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin leads to a substantial reduction in the number of HeLa cells that contain processing bodies. In contrast, stress granules are not disrupted but seem to be only partially affected by the inhibition of Hsp90. However, it is striking that eIF4E as well as its binding partner eIF4E transporter (4E-T), which mediates the import of eIF4E into the nucleus, are obviously lost from stress granules. Furthermore, the amount of eIF4G that is associated with the cap via eIF4E is reduced by geldanamycin treatment. Thus, the chaperone activity of Hsp90 probably contributes to the correct localization of eIF4E and 4E-T to stress granules and also to the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, both of which may be needed for eIF4E to acquire the physiological functionality that underlies the mechanism of translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2003183310,"Heparan sulfate (HS) chains bind and modulate the signaling efficiency of many ligands, including members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor families. We previously reported the structure of HS synthesized by embryonic fibroblasts from mice with a gene trap mutation of Ext1 that encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in HS chain elongation. The gene trap mutation results in low expression of Ext1, and, as a consequence, HS chain length is substantially reduced. In the present study, Ext1 mutant and wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts were analyzed for the functional consequences of the Ext1 mutation for growth factor signaling and interaction with the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to FGF2 stimulation was markedly decreased in the Ext1 mutant fibroblasts, whereas neither PDGF-BB nor FGF10 signaling was significantly affected. Furthermore, Ext1 mutants displayed reduced ability to attach to collagen I and to contract collagen lattices, even though no differences in the expression of collagen-binding integrins were observed. Reintroduction of Ext1in the Ext1 mutant fibroblasts rescued HS chain length, FGF2 signaling, and the ability of the fibroblasts to contract collagen. These data suggest that the length of the HS chains is a critical determinant of HS-protein interactions and emphasize the essential role of EXT1 in providing specific binding sites for growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins."

A model is provided by proinsulin, whose misfolding is associated with β-cell dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. An insulin analogue containing a subtle core substitution (LeuA16 → Val) is biologically active, and its crystal structure recapitulates that of the wild-type protein.

Substitutions elsewhere in the core similarly destabilize the native state but, unlike ValA16, preserve folding efficiency.

Although to date clinical mutations (excluding insertion or removal of cysteines) have clustered in the B-domain, our results demonstrate that the A-domain is also required for efficient folding. The aberrant properties of [ValA16]proinsulin thus provide a model for the molecular genetics of a disease of protein misfolding. Insulin was provided by Eli Lilly and Co.; S-sulfonate B-chain derivatives were obtained by oxidative sulfitolysis (51.Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G.

HEK293T cells were cultured at 37 °C in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin with 5% CO2.

Plasmid DNA (2 μg) was transfected into each well using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For studies of the unfolded protein response (UPR), cells were seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before transfection. Plasmid DNAs containing proinsulin (wild type or variant) were co-transfected with plasmids (provided by R. Kaufman) encoding luciferase (driven by BiP promoter) and β-galactosidase (driven by CMV promoter) at 5:2:1 ratio using Lipofectamine; assays were performed in triplicate. At 40 h post-transfection, cells were preincubated in methionine/cysteine-deficient medium for 30 min, metabolically labeled in the same medium containing 35S-labeled Met and Cys for 1 h, washed once with complete medium, and chased for the indicated times. To examine degradation, labeled cells were chased for 4 h with or without 20 μm MG132 or lactacystin. After chase media were collected, cells were lysed in 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Lysates and chase media were immunoprecipitated with guinea pig anti-insulin antiserum (LINCO Diagnostics, Inc.) and analyzed by Tris-Tricine/urea-SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (33.Liu M.

The UPR assay (see supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Table S1) was performed as described previously (56.Tirasophon W. Welihinda A.A. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1812-1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At 40 h post-transfection cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in luciferase assay buffer, and transferred to a 96-well plate; luminometry was performed in a Turner Biosystems plate luminometer using the Dual-Light assay system (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis employed a randomized block design analysis of variance model after checking for appropriateness of a normality assumption on errors using a Q-Q plot with Wilk-Shapiro test. Testing (two-tailed) was done at a significance level of α = 0.05. When significant findings were discovered, a nonparametric version of analysis of variance was run to ensure consistency. CD spectra, obtained using an Aviv spectropolarimeter equipped with a titration unit for denaturation studies, were measured at a protein concentration of 5 μm at 4 °C (57.Hua Q.X. Chu Y.C. Jia W.

CD-detected guanidine denaturation data (222 nm) were fitted by nonlinear least squares to a two-state model (supplemental Table S2) as described previously (58.Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, CD data, θ(x), were fitted by a nonlinear least-squares program according to Equation 1, θ(x)=θA+θBe(-ΔGH2O0-mx)/RT1+e(-ΔGH2O0-mx)/RT(Eq. 1) where x is the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride, and where θA and θB are base-line values in the native and unfolded states. These base lines were approximated by pre- and post-transition lines θA(x) = θAH2O + mAx and θBH2O + mBx. Fitting the original CD data and base lines simultaneously circumvents artifacts associated with linear plots of DG as a function of denaturant according to ΔG0(x) = ΔGH2O0 + m0x (for reviews see Refs. 58.Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 59.Pace C.N. Shaw K.L. Proteins. 2000; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion with a 1:2.5 ratio of Zn2+ to protein monomer and 3.7:1 ratio of phenol to protein monomer (49.Wan Z. Xu B. Huang K. Chu Y.C. Li B. Nakagawa S.H. Qu Y. Hu S.Q. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 16119-16133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Drops consisted of 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 0.02 m HCl) mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.05 m sodium citrate, 5% acetone, 0.03% phenol, and 0.01% zinc acetate (pH 8.0)). Crystals (space group R3) were obtained at room temperature after 2 weeks. Data were collected from single crystals flash-frozen to 100 K. Reflections from 22.58 to 1.8 Å were measured using synchrotron radiation (Chess, Cornell University). Data were processed with programs DENZO (version 1.9.6) and SCALEPACK (version 1.9.6). The structure was determined by molecular replacement using CNS; initial model was the wild-type TRf dimer (PDB identifier 1RWE) following removal of water, zinc, and chloride ions. A translation-function search was performed following rotation-function analysis of data between 15.0 and 4.0 Å. Rigid-body refinement using CNS, employing overall anisotropic temperature factors and bulk-solvent correction, yielded values of 0.31 and 0.30 for R and Rfree, respectively, for data between 19.2 and 3.0 Å resolution. Between refinement cycles, 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc maps were calculated using data to 3.0 Å resolution; zinc, chloride ions, and phenol molecules were built using O (60.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12931) Google Scholar). Water molecules were calculated and checked using DDQ (61.van den Akker F. Hol W.G.

LeuA16, inaccessible in the native state (Fig. 2A, red), adjoins TyrA19 and CysA20 (Fig. 2B, blue and gold, respectively) along the inner surface of the A12–A19 α-helix and projects between CysA11 and LeuB15 (gold and gray). Hydrophobic collapse of these side chains in the nascent polypeptide is proposed to orient CysA20 and CysB19 for initial pairing (20.Narhi L.O. Hua Q.X. Arakawa T. Fox G.M. Tsai L. Rosenfeld R.

Science. 1966; 154: 1509-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction leads to native disulfide pairing, demonstrating that information required for proinsulin folding is contained within the A and B sequences (71.Tang J.G. Tsou C.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 429-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yield is limited by off-pathway products under kinetic control (disulfide-linked cyclic A-chains, cyclic B-chains, B-chain dimers, and B-chain polymers). The robustness of chain combination to amino acid substitutions has enabled synthesis of hundreds of analogues in past decades. As an initial test of the importance of LeuA16 in disulfide pairing, we prepared a variant A-chain containing ValA16. Reactions employed 80 mg of wild-type A-chain and 40 mg of B-chain (each as S-sulfonate derivatives). Whereas this protocol ordinarily yields 8–9 mg of wild-type insulin (following purification by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (51.Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P.

Because the threshold of HPLC detection is <40 μg, the efficiency of chain combination was reduced by >200-fold. Refolding of proinsulin is more efficient than chain combination (73.Steiner D.F. Diabetes. 1978; 27: 145-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we sought to prepare ValA16-human proinsulin (position 81 of the polypeptide) by recombinant expression in E. coli. Bacterial expression gave rise to inclusion bodies containing reduced and unfolded proinsulin; following purification, oxidative refolding ordinarily yields native disulfide pairing (52.Mackin R.B. Choquette M.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 74.Frank B.H. Chance R.E. MMW Munch. Med. Wochenschr. 1983; 125: S14-S20Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type and variant polypeptides within inclusion bodies achieved similar levels; the reduced polypeptides were purified in similar yield. Although refolding of wild-type proinsulin was robust (52.Mackin R.B. Choquette M.H. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 27: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), however, the yield of [ValA16]proinsulin was negligible. The refolding mixture gave rise to a broad and inhomogeneous HPLC elution profile, suggesting the presence of multiple products.

https://openalex.org/W2040565970,"The antiinflammatory protein annexin-1 (ANXA1) and the adaptor S100A10 (p11), inhibit cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2alpha) by direct interaction. Since the latter is responsible for the cleavage of arachidonic acid at membrane phospholipids, all three proteins modulate eicosanoid production. We have previously shown the association of ANXA1 expression with that of CFTR, the multifactorial protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. This could in part account for the abnormal inflammatory status characteristic of this disease. We postulated that CFTR participates in the regulation of eicosanoid release by direct interaction with a complex containing ANXA1, p11 and cPLA2alpha. We first analyzed by plasmon surface resonance the in vitro binding of CFTR to the three proteins. A significant interaction between p11 and the NBD1 domain of CFTR was found. We observed in Calu-3 cells a rapid and partial redistribution of all four proteins in detergent resistant membranes (DRM) induced by TNF-alpha. This was concomitant with increased IL-8 synthesis and cPLA2alpha activation, ultimately resulting in eicosanoid (PGE2 and LTB4) overproduction. DRM destabilizing agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin induced further cPLA2alpha activation and eicosanoid release, but inhibited IL-8 synthesis. We tested in parallel the effect of short exposure of cells to CFTR inhibitors Inh172 and Gly-101. Both inhibitors induced a rapid increase in eicosanoid production. Longer exposure to Inh172 did not increase further eicosanoid release, but inhibited TNF-alpha-induced relocalization to DRM. These results show that (i) CFTR may form a complex with cPLA2alpha and ANXA1 via interaction with p11, (ii) CFTR inhibition and DRM disruption induce eicosanoid synthesis, and (iii) suggest that the putative cPLA2/ANXA1/p11/CFTR complex may participate in the modulation of the TNF-alpha-induced production of eicosanoids, pointing to the importance of membrane composition and CFTR function in the regulation of inflammation mediator synthesis."

We have previously reported that RhoE also inhibits cell cycle progression and Ras-induced transformation, specifically preventing cyclin D1 translation. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying those observations. RhoE inhibits the phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 in response to extracellular stimuli. However, RhoE does not affect the activation of mTOR, the major kinase regulating 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, as indicated by the phosphorylation levels of the mTOR substrate S6K, the dynamics of mTOR/Raptor association, and the observation that RhoE, as opposed to rapamycin, does not impair cellular growth. Interestingly, RhoE prevents the release of the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4E from 4E-BP1, inhibiting cap-dependent translation. Accordingly, RhoE also inhibits the expression and the transcriptional activity of the eIF4E target c-Myc. Consistent with its crucial role in cell proliferation, we show that eIF4E can rescue both cell cycle progression and Ras-induced transformation in RhoE-expressing cells, indicating that the inhibition of eIF4E function is critical to mediate the anti-proliferative effects of RhoE.

https://openalex.org/W2124909139,"The light-activated enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) catalyzes an essential step in the synthesis of the most abundant pigment on Earth, chlorophyll. This unique reaction involves the sequential addition of a hydride and proton across the C17=C18 double bond of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) by dynamically coupled quantum tunneling and is an important model system for studying the mechanism of hydrogen transfer reactions. In the present work, we have combined site-directed mutagenesis studies with a variety of sensitive spectroscopic and kinetic measurements to provide new insights into the mechanistic role of three universally conserved Cys residues in POR. We show that mutation of Cys-226 dramatically alters the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme. In contrast to wild-type POR, the characteristic charge-transfer intermediate, formed upon hydride transfer from NADPH to the C17 position of Pchlide, is absent in C226S variant enzymes. This suggests a concerted hydrogen transfer mechanism where proton transfer only is rate-limiting. Moreover, Pchlide reduction does not require the network of solvent-coupled conformational changes that play a key role in the proton transfer step of wild-type POR. We conclude that this globally important enzyme is finely tuned to facilitate efficient photochemistry, and the removal of a key interaction with Pchlide in the C226S variants significantly affects the local active site structure in POR, resulting in a shorter donor-acceptor distance for proton transfer."

Methodology/Principal Findings In an effort to replicate these results in a different population, rs5848 was genotyped in 256 FTLD cases and 1695 controls from the Netherlands. Single SNP gender-adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed no significant association between variation at rs5848 and FTLD. Fisher's exact test, failed to find any significant association between rs5848 and a subset of 23 pathology confirmed FTLD-TDP cases. Conclusions/Significance The evidence presented here suggests that variation at rs5848 does not contribute to the etiology of FTLD in the Dutch population."
https://openalex.org/W1966227891,"Background Adrenomedullin (AM) is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer and stimulates pancreatic cancer cells leading to increased tumor growth and metastasis. The current study examines the role of specific AM receptors on tumor and cells resembling the tumor microenvironment (human pancreatic stellate - HPSC, human umbilical vein – HUVEC and mouse lung endothelial cells - MLEC). Methods and Findings AM receptors ADMR and CRLR were present in HPSC, HUVEC and MLECs while PDAC cells possessed only ADMR receptors as assessed by RT-PCR and western blotting. All cell lines expressed and secreted AM as indicated by ELISA. The growth of each of the cell lines was stimulated by exogenous AM and inhibited by the antagonist AMA. AM also stimulated in vitro angiogenesis assessed by polygon formation of endothelial cell lines. SiRNA-mediated silencing of ADMR, but not CRLR, reduced basal growth of all cells examined and reduced polygon formation of endothelial cells in vitro. Orthotopic tumors developed with shADMR bearing cancer cells had dramatically reduced primary tumor volume (>90%) and lung and liver metastasis compared to shControl bearing cells. To validate ADMR as a potential therapeutic target, in vivo studies were conducted using neutral nanoliposomes to systemically deliver human siRNA to ADMR to silence human cancer cells and mouse siRNA to ADMR to silence mouse tumor stromal cells. Systemic silencing of both human and mouse ADMR had no obvious adverse effects but strongly reduced tumor development. Conclusion ADMR mediates the stimulatory effects of AM on cancer cells and on endothelial and stellate cells within the tumor microenvironment. These data support the further development of ADMR as a useful target treatment of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1972427623,"Background Leprosy was common in Europe eight to twelve centuries ago but molecular confirmation of this has been lacking. We have extracted M. leprae ancient DNA (aDNA) from medieval bones and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typed the DNA, this provides insight into the pattern of leprosy transmission in Europe and may assist in the understanding of M. leprae evolution. Methods and Findings Skeletons have been exhumed from 3 European countries (the United Kingdom, Denmark and Croatia) and are dated around the medieval period (476 to 1350 A.D.). we tested for the presence of 3 previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 aDNA extractions. M. leprae aDNA was extracted from 6 of the 10 bone samples. SNP analysis of these 6 extractions were compared to previously analysed European SNP data using the same PCR assays and were found to be the same. Testing for the presence of SNPs in M. leprae DNA extracted from ancient bone samples is a novel approach to analysing European M. leprae DNA and the findings concur with the previously published data that European M. leprae strains fall in to one group (SNP group 3). Conclusions These findings support the suggestion that the M. leprae genome is extremely stable and show that archaeological M. leprae DNA can be analysed to gain detailed information about the genotypic make-up of European leprosy, which may assist in the understanding of leprosy transmission worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2045441997,"Human movement can be guided automatically (implicit control) or attentively (explicit control). Explicit control may be engaged when learning a new movement, while implicit control enables simultaneous execution of multiple actions. Explicit and implicit control can often be assigned arbitrarily: we can simultaneously drive a car and tune the radio, seamlessly allocating implicit or explicit control to either action. This flexibility suggests that sensorimotor signals, including those that encode spatially overlapping perception and behavior, can be accurately segregated to explicit and implicit control processes.We tested human subjects' ability to segregate sensorimotor signals to parallel control processes by requiring dual (explicit and implicit) control of the same reaching movement and testing for interference between these processes. Healthy control subjects were able to engage dual explicit and implicit motor control without degradation of performance compared to explicit or implicit control alone. We then asked whether segregation of explicit and implicit motor control can be selectively disrupted by studying dual-control performance in subjects with no clinically manifest neurologic deficits in the presymptomatic stage of Huntington's disease (HD). These subjects performed successfully under either explicit or implicit control alone, but were impaired in the dual-control condition.The human nervous system can exert dual control on a single action, and is therefore able to accurately segregate sensorimotor signals to explicit and implicit control. The impairment observed in the presymptomatic stage of HD points to a possible crucial contribution of the striatum to the segregation of sensorimotor signals to multiple control processes."

Previous reports showed that interleukin (IL)-1β up-regulates Pla2g2a gene transcription via C/EBPβ and NFκB. Interestingly, SAA activated smooth muscle cell IL-1β mRNA expression, however, blocking IL-1 receptors had no effect on SAA-mediated activation of sPLA2 expression. Thus, the observed changes in sPLA2 expression were not secondary to SAA-induced IL-1 receptor activation. The association of SAA with high density lipoprotein abrogated the SAA-induced increase in sPLA2 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2170422286,"Since its advent, structural biology has played a major role in the understanding of biological processes at the molecular level. This, in turn, has enabled the progression and development of several fields in biological sciences. As a consequence there has been a continuing demand for faster and more cost-effective determination of protein structures and their in-depth functional, mechanistic and biological analysis. The lack of a well-established process historically meant that structures were been solved in a case-by-case manner, with academic researchers establishing specific protocols over a relatively long period of time that are difficult to implement or inappropriate for high-throughput approaches. As the sequencing of the human genome was completed the gap between known genes and solved protein structures became wider. As a result concerted and systematic technology-driven ‘structural genomics’ (SG) efforts to solve protein structures in a high throughput manner were begun (for thorough reviews see [1], [2]).

First formalised in 1998 [3]–[5], several major SG efforts were subsequently started such as the NIH-funded Protein Structure Initiative (PSI; http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PSI), European initiatives ‘The Protein Structure Factory (PSF; http://www.proteinstrukturfabrik.de) and ‘Structural Proteomics in Europe (SPINE; http://www.spineurope.org) and Japanese Protein 3000 and RIKEN Structural Genomics/Proteomics programs (http://protein.gsc.riken.jp). The majority of these early programmes were tasked with exploring the breadth of the protein structural universe by focussing on prokaryotic targets whilst driving novel structural biology technology for a high-throughput environment [1], [6].

New avenues have been opened by the availability of detailed structural descriptions of proteins and enzymes involved in the normal (or abnormal) functioning of the human body and associated pathogens. In particular, this information provides a better understanding of the basis by which different proteins achieve selectivity and specific binding to their cognate ligands and drugs [1]. Indeed, several marketed drugs in recent years have been developed using structure-based methods, targeting a wide range of disease such as AIDS, leukaemia, cancers and venous thromboembolic events [1], [7]–[10].

Despite these successes, determining the structures of human proteins in a high-throughput manner was seen to be technically challenging relative to those of less complex organisms (e.g. prokaryotes), where issues such as the lack of solubility of expressed proteins in simple bacterial systems pose major bottlenecks to scaling the structure determination process [11]. The SGC (http://www.thesgc.org) was created in 2003 as a response to this challenge.

The SGC is a not-for-profit organisation that aims to solve the three dimensional structures of proteins of medical relevance and place them into the public domain without encumbrance or restriction. The SGC has adopted a protein-family based approach whereby protein targets are chosen from discrete and medically-relevant human protein families. This approach ensures that comparative analysis and “blanket” methods can be applied to members of same family [11]. The SGC is driving the concept of “open-source science” to enable drug discovery by promoting pre-competitive structural biology and medicinal chemistry. This is achieved by combining academic and industrial efforts to create open-access chemical and clinical probes [12]–[14] which might be used in a pre-competitive manner for target validation purposes, for example.

Since the production phase of the SGC began in 2004, we have released the coordinates of over 800 protein structures related to several diseases and metabolic disorders into the public domain of which over 700 are novel and unique. Whilst the SGC focuses primarily on human targets, we also pursue the structure determination of proteins from parasitic organisms associated with neglected diseases, such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. We have deposited more than 70 of these structures into the public domain. These structures are providing a significant impact with the SGC providing 61% of publicly available apicomplexan structures. The SGC has also developed new protocols and methods that are now widely used [15]–[18] and is developing chemical probes [19] and small molecules in areas such as human epigenetics and human protein kinases, to be placed in the public domain [1] as part of the ‘open-source’ science approach.

In this PLoS ONE Collection we present articles covering the structure determination of a number of targets by the SGC along with additional work carried out to further characterise these proteins. Since SG data is intrinsically heterogeneous and not always accessible to non-specialists, all the articles from this collection are available also as an enhanced version using our interactive visualisation platform – known as iSee – which allows the reader to interact and manipulate the 3D scenes prepared by the authors to highlight and support information given in the main text of the article [20]."
https://openalex.org/W2088137321,"Selection methods that require only a single-switch input, such as a button click or blink, are potentially useful for individuals with motor impairments, mobile technology users, and individuals wishing to transmit information securely. We present a single-switch selection method, ""Nomon,"" that is general and efficient. Existing single-switch selection methods require selectable options to be arranged in ways that limit potential applications. By contrast, traditional operating systems, web browsers, and free-form applications (such as drawing) place options at arbitrary points on the screen. Nomon, however, has the flexibility to select any point on a screen. Nomon adapts automatically to an individual's clicking ability; it allows a person who clicks precisely to make a selection quickly and allows a person who clicks imprecisely more time to make a selection without error. Nomon reaps gains in information rate by allowing the specification of beliefs (priors) about option selection probabilities and by avoiding tree-based selection schemes in favor of direct (posterior) inference. We have developed both a Nomon-based writing application and a drawing application. To evaluate Nomon's performance, we compared the writing application with a popular existing method for single-switch writing (row-column scanning). Novice users wrote 35% faster with the Nomon interface than with the scanning interface. An experienced user (author TB, with > 10 hours practice) wrote at speeds of 9.3 words per minute with Nomon, using 1.2 clicks per character and making no errors in the final text."

https://openalex.org/W1976451594,"Background The intrinsically disordered N-ter domain (NTD) of p53 encompasses approximately hundred amino acids that contain a transactivation domain (1–73) and a proline-rich domain (64–92) and is responsible for transactivation function and apoptosis. It also possesses an auto-inhibitory function as its removal results in remarkable reduction in dissociation of p53 from DNA. Principal Findings/Methodology In this report, we have discovered that p53-NTD spanning amino acid residues 1–125 (NTD125) interacted with WT p53 and stabilized its wild type conformation under physiological and elevated temperatures, both in vitro and in cellular systems. NTD125 prevented irreversible thermal aggregation of heat denatured p53, enhanced p21-5′-DBS binding and further restored DBS binding activity of heat-denatured p53, in vitro, in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo ELISA and immunoprecipitation analysis of NTD125-transfected cells revealed that NTD125 shifted equilibrium from p53 mutant to wild type under heat stress conditions. Further, NTD125 initiated nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53 in transcriptionally active state in order to activate p53 downstream genes such as p21, Bax, PUMA, Noxa and SUMO. Conclusion/Significance Here, we showed that a novel chaperone-like activity resides in p53-N-ter region. This study might have significance in understanding the role of p53-NTD in p53 stabilization, conformational activation and apoptosis under heat-stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2068252159,"The protein kinases Mps1 and Polo, which are required for proper cell cycle regulation in meiosis and mitosis, localize to numerous ooplasmic filaments during prometaphase in Drosophila oocytes. These filaments first appear throughout the oocyte at the end of prophase and are disassembled after egg activation.We showed here that Mps1 and Polo proteins undergo dynamic and reversible localization to static ooplasmic filaments as part of an oocyte-specific response to hypoxia. The observation that Mps1- and Polo-associated filaments reappear in the same locations through multiple cycles of oxygen deprivation demonstrates that underlying structural components of the filaments must still be present during normoxic conditions. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we observed triple-helical binding of Mps1 to numerous electron-dense filaments, with the gold label wrapped around the outside of the filaments like a garland. In addition, we showed that in live oocytes the relocalization of Mps1 and Polo to filaments is sensitive to injection of collagenase, suggesting that the structural components of the filaments are composed of collagen-like fibrils. However, the collagen-like genes we have been able to test so far (vkg and CG42453) did not appear to be associated with the filaments, demonstrating that the collagenase-sensitive component of the filaments is one of a number of other Drosophila proteins bearing a collagenase cleavage site. Finally, as hypoxia is known to cause Mps1 protein to accumulate at kinetochores in syncytial embryos, we also show that GFP-Polo accumulates at both kinetochores and centrosomes in hypoxic syncytial embryos.These findings identify both a novel cellular structure (the ooplasmic filaments) as well as a new localization pattern for Mps1 and Polo and demonstrate that hypoxia affects Polo localization in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1999339256,"During the last years gene interaction networks are increasingly being used for the assessment and interpretation of biological measurements. Knowledge of the interaction partners of an unknown protein allows scientists to understand the complex relationships between genetic products, helps to reveal unknown biological functions and pathways, and get a more detailed picture of an organism's complexity. Being able to measure all protein interactions under all relevant conditions is virtually impossible. Hence, computational methods integrating different datasets for predicting gene interactions are needed. However, when integrating different sources one has to account for the fact that some parts of the information may be redundant, which may lead to an overestimation of the true likelihood of an interaction. Our method integrates information derived from three different databases (Bioverse, HiMAP and STRING) for predicting human gene interactions. A Bayesian approach was implemented in order to integrate the different data sources on a common quantitative scale. An important assumption of the Bayesian integration is independence of the input data (features). Our study shows that the conditional dependency cannot be ignored when combining gene interaction databases that rely on partially overlapping input data. In addition, we show how the correlation structure between the databases can be detected and we propose a linear model to correct for this bias. Benchmarking the results against two independent reference data sets shows that the integrated model outperforms the individual datasets. Our method provides an intuitive strategy for weighting the different features while accounting for their conditional dependencies."
