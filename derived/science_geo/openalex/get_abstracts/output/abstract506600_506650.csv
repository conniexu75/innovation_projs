https://openalex.org/W2029641573,"Since the recognition that allopatric speciation can be induced by large-scale reconfigurations of the landscape that isolate formerly continuous populations, such as the separation of continents by plate tectonics, the uplift of mountains or the formation of large rivers, landscape change has been viewed as a primary driver of biological diversification. This process is referred to in biogeography as vicariance. In the most species-rich region of the world, the Neotropics, the sundering of populations associated with the Andean uplift is ascribed this principal role in speciation. An alternative model posits that rather than being directly linked to landscape change, allopatric speciation is initiated to a greater extent by dispersal events, with the principal drivers of speciation being organism-specific abilities to persist and disperse in the landscape. Landscape change is not a necessity for speciation in this model. Here we show that spatial and temporal patterns of genetic differentiation in Neotropical birds are highly discordant across lineages and are not reconcilable with a model linking speciation solely to landscape change. Instead, the strongest predictors of speciation are the amount of time a lineage has persisted in the landscape and the ability of birds to move through the landscape matrix. These results, augmented by the observation that most species-level diversity originated after episodes of major Andean uplift in the Neogene period, suggest that dispersal and differentiation on a matrix previously shaped by large-scale landscape events was a major driver of avian speciation in lowland Neotropical rainforests."
https://openalex.org/W2013779315,"The ribosome is a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis and a major target for small-molecule inhibitors. Compared to the wealth of structural information available on ribosome-targeting antibiotics in bacteria, our understanding of the binding mode of ribosome inhibitors in eukaryotes is currently limited. Here we used X-ray crystallography to determine 16 high-resolution structures of 80S ribosomes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in complexes with 12 eukaryote-specific and 4 broad-spectrum inhibitors. All inhibitors were found associated with messenger RNA and transfer RNA binding sites. In combination with kinetic experiments, the structures suggest a model for the action of cycloheximide and lactimidomycin, which explains why lactimidomycin, the larger compound, specifically targets the first elongation cycle. The study defines common principles of targeting and resistance, provides insights into translation inhibitor mode of action and reveals the structural determinants responsible for species selectivity which could guide future drug development. Whereas previous structural investigation of ribosome inhibitors has been done using the prokaryotic ribosome, this work presents X-ray crystal structures of the yeast ribosome in complex with 16 inhibitors including eukaryotic-specific inhibitors; the inhibitors all bind the mRNA or tRNA binding sites, larger molecules appear to target specifically the first elongation cycle. As the ribosome is a common target of antibiotics, there is a wealth of structural data on the binding of the bacterial ribosome to various inhibitors. Our understanding of inhibitor binding to the larger eukaryotic ribosome is limited. Marat Yusupov and colleagues present the structure of the yeast 80S ribosome bound to 12 eukaryote-specific and 4 broad-spectrum inhibitors. On the basis of structural data and kinetic studies, the authors propose a model for the action of cycloheximide and lactimidomycin that demonstrates that the size of an inhibitor can dictate its accessibility to the ribosome and thus its mechanism of action. This new model suggests general principles for structure-based design of new antibiotics as well as therapeutics against fungal and protozoan infections, cancers and genetic disorders induced by premature stop codons."
https://openalex.org/W2057194569,"Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is essential for oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian mitochondria. It couples electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone with proton translocation across the energy-transducing inner membrane, providing electrons for respiration and driving ATP synthesis. Mammalian complex I contains 44 different nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded subunits, with a combined mass of 1 MDa. The 14 conserved 'core' subunits have been structurally defined in the minimal, bacterial complex, but the structures and arrangement of the 30 'supernumerary' subunits are unknown. Here we describe a 5 Å resolution structure of complex I from Bos taurus heart mitochondria, a close relative of the human enzyme, determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. We present the structures of the mammalian core subunits that contain eight iron-sulphur clusters and 60 transmembrane helices, identify 18 supernumerary transmembrane helices, and assign and model 14 supernumerary subunits. Thus, we considerably advance knowledge of the structure of mammalian complex I and the architecture of its supernumerary ensemble around the core domains. Our structure provides insights into the roles of the supernumerary subunits in regulation, assembly and homeostasis, and a basis for understanding the effects of mutations that cause a diverse range of human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2116811037,"Gibbons are small arboreal apes that display an accelerated rate of evolutionary chromosomal rearrangement and occupy a key node in the primate phylogeny between Old World monkeys and great apes. Here we present the assembly and analysis of a northern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys) genome. We describe the propensity for a gibbon-specific retrotransposon (LAVA) to insert into chromosome segregation genes and alter transcription by providing a premature termination site, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism for the genome plasticity of the gibbon lineage. We further show that the gibbon genera (Nomascus, Hylobates, Hoolock and Symphalangus) experienced a near-instantaneous radiation ∼5 million years ago, coincident with major geographical changes in southeast Asia that caused cycles of habitat compression and expansion. Finally, we identify signatures of positive selection in genes important for forelimb development (TBX5) and connective tissues (COL1A1) that may have been involved in the adaptation of gibbons to their arboreal habitat. The genome of the gibbon, a tree-dwelling ape from Asia positioned between Old World monkeys and the great apes, is presented, providing insights into the evolutionary history of gibbon species and their accelerated karyotypes, as well as evidence for selection of genes such as those for forelimb development and connective tissue that may be important for locomotion through trees. The many species of gibbons are small, tree-living apes from Southeast Asia, most of them listed as 'endangered' or 'critically endangered' on the IUCN list. In their presentation of the genome of the northern white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys) , Lucia Carbone and colleagues provide intriguing insights into the biology and evolutionary history of a group that straddles the divide between Old World monkeys and the great apes. The authors investigate how a novel gibbon-specific retrotransposon might be the source of gibbons' genome plasticity. Rapid karyotype evolution combined with multiple episodes of climate and environmental change might explain the almost instantaneous divergence of the four gibbon genera. Positive selection on genes involved in forelimb development and connective tissue might have been related to gibbons' unique mode of locomotion in the tropical canopy."
https://openalex.org/W2093290764,"Quasars are rapidly accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of massive galaxies. They display a broad range of properties across all wavelengths, reflecting the diversity in the physical conditions of the regions close to the central engine. These properties, however, are not random, but form well-defined trends. The dominant trend is known as 'Eigenvector 1', in which many properties correlate with the strength of optical iron and [O III] emission. The main physical driver of Eigenvector 1 has long been suspected to be the quasar luminosity normalized by the mass of the hole (the 'Eddington ratio'), which is an important parameter of the black hole accretion process. But a definitive proof has been missing. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals that the Eddington ratio indeed drives Eigenvector 1. We also find that orientation plays a significant role in determining the observed kinematics of the gas in the broad-line region, implying a flattened, disk-like geometry for the fast-moving clouds close to the black hole. Our results show that most of the diversity of quasar phenomenology can be unified using two simple quantities: Eddington ratio and orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2067759714,"Molecular 'assembly lines', in which organic molecules undergo iterative processes such as chain elongation and functional group manipulation, are found in many natural systems, including polyketide biosynthesis. Here we report the creation of such an assembly line using the iterative, reagent-controlled homologation of a boronic ester. This process relies on the reactivity of α-lithioethyl tri-isopropylbenzoate, which inserts into carbon-boron bonds with exceptionally high fidelity and stereocontrol; each chain-extension step generates a new boronic ester, which is immediately ready for further homologation. We used this method to generate organic molecules that contain ten contiguous, stereochemically defined methyl groups. Several stereoisomers were synthesized and shown to adopt different shapes-helical or linear-depending on the stereochemistry of the methyl groups. This work should facilitate the rational design of molecules with predictable shapes, which could have an impact in areas of molecular sciences in which bespoke molecules are required."

https://openalex.org/W1965084456,"Sensing chirality is of fundamental importance to many fields, including analytical and biological chemistry, pharmacology, and fundamental physics. Recent developments have extended optical chiral sensing using microwaves, fs pulses, superchiral light, and photoionization. The most widely used methods are the traditional methods of circular dichroism and optical rotation (OR). However, chiral signals are typically very weak, and their measurement is limited by larger time-dependent backgrounds and by imperfect and slow subtraction procedures. Here, we demonstrate a pulsed-laser bowtie-cavity-enhanced polarimeter with counter-propagating beams, which solves these background problems: the chiral signals are enhanced by the number of cavity passes; the effects of linear birefringence are suppressed by a large induced intracavity Faraday rotation; and rapid signal reversals are effected by reversing the Faraday rotation and subtracting signals from the counter-propagating beams. These advantages allow measurements of absolute chiral signals in environments where background subtractions are not feasible: we measure optical rotation from chiral vapour in open air, and from chiral liquids in the evanescent wave (EW) produced by total internal reflection at a prism surface. EW-OR of (+)-maltodextrin and (-)-fructose solutions confirm the Drude-Condon model for Maxwell's equations in isotropic optically active media. In particular, the effective optical rotation path length, near index matching, is equal to the Goos-H\""anchen shift of the EW. The limits of this polarimeter, when using a continuous-wave laser locked to a stable high-finesse cavity, should match sensitivity measurements for linear birefringence ($3\times 10^{-13}$ rad), which is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than current chiral detection limits, transforming the power of chiral sensing in many fields."

https://openalex.org/W2052260682,"The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) controls diverse aspects of plant immunity, growth, and development. The amplitude and duration of JA responses are controlled in large part by the intracellular level of jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-Ile). In contrast to detailed knowledge of the JA-Ile biosynthetic pathway, little is known about enzymes involved in JA-Ile metabolism and turnover. Cytochromes P450 (CYP) 94B3 and 94C1 were recently shown to sequentially oxidize JA-Ile to hydroxy (12OH-JA-Ile) and dicarboxy (12COOH-JA-Ile) derivatives. Here, we report that a third member (CYP94B1) of the CYP94 family also participates in oxidative turnover of JA-Ile in Arabidopsis. In vitro studies showed that recombinant CYP94B1 converts JA-Ile to 12OH-JA-Ile and lesser amounts of 12COOH-JA-Ile. Consistent with this finding, metabolic and physiological characterization of CYP94B1 loss-of-function and overexpressing plants demonstrated that CYP94B1 and CYP94B3 coordinately govern the majority (>95%) of 12-hydroxylation of JA-Ile in wounded leaves. Analysis of CYP94-promoter-GUS reporter lines indicated that CYP94B1 and CYP94B3 serve unique and overlapping spatio-temporal roles in JA-Ile homeostasis. Subcellular localization studies showed that CYP94s involved in conversion of JA-Ile to 12COOH-JA-Ile reside on endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In vitro studies further showed that 12COOH-JA-Ile, unlike JA-Ile, fails to promote assembly of COI1-JAZ co-receptor complexes. The double loss-of-function mutant of CYP94B3 and ILL6, a JA-Ile amidohydrolase, displayed a JA profile consistent with the collaborative action of the oxidative and the hydrolytic pathways in JA-Ile turnover. Collectively, our results provide an integrated view of how multiple ER-localized CYP94 and JA amidohydrolase enzymes attenuate JA signaling during stress responses.

JA-Ile exerts its effects on gene expression by promoting degradation of Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) repressor proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In cells containing low levels of JA-Ile, the activity of transcription factors such as MYC2 that positively regulate JA-responsive genes is repressed by direct binding of JAZ proteins and associated co-repressors (13.Yan Y.

Proteolytic degradation of JAZ substrates via the ubiquitin-proteasome system releases MYC2 and other transcription factors from repression, thereby leading to expression of JA-response genes.

Given the fitness costs associated with expression of JA-regulated defenses, which are energetically demanding and potentially toxic, plants appear to have evolved various strategies to attenuate the strength of these responses (20.Koo A.J.

Several mechanisms to reign in JA responses have recently been elucidated (22.Campos M.L. Kang J.H. Howe G.A. Jasmonate-triggered plant immunity.J. Chem. Ecol. 2014; 40: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar).

Regulation and function of Arabidopsis JASMONATE ZIM-domain genes in response to wounding and herbivory.Plant Physiol. 2008; 146: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing events that remove or weaken the COI1-interacting JAZ degron provide a mechanism to produce JAZ variants that are more resistant to ubiquitin-mediated degradation, thus repressing JA responses in cells containing high JA-Ile levels (24.Moreno J.E.

Niu Y. Browse J. Howe G.A. Top hits in contemporary JAZ: an update on jasmonate signaling.Phytochemistry. 2009; 70: 1547-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Similarly, some full-length JAZ proteins (e.g. JAZ8) have a non-canonical degron that does not interact with COI1 in the presence of JA-Ile (27.Shyu C. Figueroa P. Depew C.L. Cooke T.F. Sheard L.B.

JAZ8 lacks a canonical degron and has an EAR motif that mediates transcriptional repression of jasmonate responses in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2012; 24: 536-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These JAZs therefore accumulate and repress their target transcription factors in the presence of JA-Ile. Another mechanism of negative feedback involves JA-dependent expression of negative-acting bHLH transcription factors that compete with MYC2 for cis-regulatory elements in the promoters of JA-responsive genes (28.Nakata M. Mitsuda N. Herde M. Koo A.J. Moreno J.E. Suzuki K. Howe G.A. Ohme-Takagi M.

Superimposed upon these transcription-based mechanisms for signal attenuation is an independent negative feedback loop involving JA-induced catabolism of JA-Ile. Two major pathways for catabolic inactivation of JA-Ile have recently been described. One pathway is catalyzed by amidohydrolases that cleave JA-Ile to jasmonic acid and Ile (32.Woldemariam M.G.

Here, we report the identification and characterization of CYP94B1 as a third enzyme in the ω-oxidation pathway for JA-Ile catabolism. Our results indicate that CYP94B1 and CYP94B3 work coordinately to catalyze the initial oxidation of JA-Ile in overlapping and distinct tissues of Arabidopsis. We also show that sequential oxidation of JA-Ile by CYP94s occurs on endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and that the 12COOH-JA-Ile product of this pathway fails to promote the formation of COI1-JAZ co-receptor complexes. Collectively, our results provide an integrated view of how ER-localized CYP94 enzymes attenuate JA signaling during stress responses. Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used as the wild-type (WT) for all experiments, and was grown as previously described (41.Koo A.J.K. Chung H.S. Kobayashi Y. Howe G.A.

A complete list of primers used in this study is provided in supplemental Table S1. Nicotiana tabacum (cv Petit Havana) plants used to infiltrate Agrobacterium tumefaciens harboring constructs for subcellular localization studies were grown in a growth chamber maintained under 18 h of light (40 µE m−2 s−1) at 23 °C and 6 h of dark at 18 °C. Transgenic lines overexpressing CYP94B3 (At3g48520) were as described previously (38.Koo A.J. Cooke T.F. Howe G.A.

Binary vector constructs for generating CYP94B1-OE lines were made by PCR-amplifying the full-length CYP94B1 (At5g63450) open reading frame (ORF) from WT genomic DNA template using the primer pair JH3_XbaI F and JH3_XhoI R1 (supplemental Table S1) and ligating the resulting PCR fragment into the XbaI and XhoI sites of a modified pBI121 vector (41.Koo A.J.K. Chung H.S. Kobayashi Y. Howe G.A. Identification of a peroxisomal acyl-activating enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in Arabidopsis.J. Biol.

Transgenic plants expressing β-glucuronidase (GUS) under the control of the respective promoters were generated for the tissue-specific expression study of CYP94B1 and CYP94B3. Promoter regions 1.8 kb and 2.0 kb upstream of CYP94B1 and CYP94B3 translation initiation sites were PCR amplified from Arabidopsis (Col-0) genomic DNA using primers shown in supplemental Table S1 and were cloned in front of uidA gene (GUS) of pBI121 using ClaI and XmaI restriction sites. The resulting 35S:CYP94B1, CYP94B1promoter:GUS and CYP94B3promoter:GUS constructs were transformed first into A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 then to Arabidopsis by the floral dip method. T1 seeds were first screened for their antibiotic resistance on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing kanamycin (50 µg ml−1) and vancomycin (100 µg ml−1), and upon transfer to soil, 20 lines harboring 35S:CYP94B1 (CYP94B1-OE) were analyzed for mRNA expression of the transgene, jasmonate profile, and fertility. Among these, three CYP94B1-OE lines were propagated to obtain homozygous T3 lines. CYP94B1promoter:GUS (B1pro:GUS) and CYP94B3promoter:GUS (B3pro:GUS)lines were selected by staining 20 ∼ 24-d old rosette leaves for GUS activity after either treating with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or mechanically wounding for 24 h. For MeJA treatment, ten microliter of 50 µm MeJA was spotted onto a leaf surface divided into 4∼6 droplets. For wounding, one leaf per plant was crushed twice across the midrib with a hemostat. MeJA treated or wounded leaves were collected after 24 h of treatment for histochemical GUS staining. Control untreated leaves were collected prior to MeJA or wounding treatment. Wounding treatment for JA measurements was conducted on fully expanded rosette leaves of 4∼5-week-old plants just before bolting by wounding twice across the midrib with a hemostat (42.Herde M. Koo A.K. Howe G. Elicitation of jasmonate-mediated defense responses by mechanical wounding and insect herbivory.in: Goossens A. Pauwels L. Jasmonate Signaling. Humana Press, 2013: 51-61Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). At indicated times after wounding (Fig. 2), damaged leaves were harvested, weighed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processed for JA extraction. Root growth inhibition assays were conducted with seedlings grown vertically on MS agar medium (0.8% sucrose) in square Petri plates supplemented with JA (10 µm) or coronatine (0.1 µm). Seedlings were grown for 8∼10 days under continuous light (100 µE m−2 s−1) in a growth chamber maintained at 21 °C. Histochemical detection of GUS activity was as described previously (43.Schilmiller A.L. Koo A.J. Howe G.A. Functional diversification of acyl-coenzyme A oxidases in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and action.Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 812-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Images of flowers were taken with a Leica MZ16 dissecting microscope. Pollen viability was determined with the fluorescein diacetate (FDA)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining procedure (3.McConn M. Browse J. The critical requirement for linolenic acid is pollen development, not photosynthesis, in an Arabidopsis mutant.Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 403-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Between 250 and 500 pollen grains were assessed in four independent trials for each genotype with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot) (excitation at 365 nm, emission at 450 nm longpass). Green fluorescence under UV excitation emitted by de-esterified product of FDA indicates live cells whereas nonviable cells incorporate only PI, which fluoresce red orange under UV light. For subcellular localization studies, ORFs of CYP94B3 and CYP94C1 were PCR amplified from WT genomic DNA using primer sets indicated in supplemental Table S1 and ligated into the XbaI and SalI restriction sites of the binary vector pVKH18En6-mRFP. An internal XbaI restriction site within the CYP94B3 gene was eliminated by using overlapping PCR to introduce a nonsense mutation (primers FBP-3873 and FBP-3874). Similarly, a SalI restriction site within CYP94C1 was removed using FBP-3877 and FBP-3878 primer set. The two gene constructs were transiently expressed in N. tabacum leaves by syringe-infiltrating the culture suspension of Agrobacterium strains harboring each construct. A second strain of Agrobacterium contained a construct encoding a soluble ER marker, GFP-HDEL (44.Brandizzi F. Hanton S. DaSilva L.L. Boevink P. Evans D. Oparka K. Denecke J. Hawes C. ER quality control can lead to retrograde transport from the ER lumen to the cytosol and the nucleoplasm in plants.Plant J. 2003; 34: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and was co-infiltrated to test co-localization. GFP and mRFP fluorescence was analyzed with an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal Microscope using microscope settings described earlier (45.Brandizzi F. Fricker M. Hawes C.

The CYP94B1 ORF was PCR amplified from WT Arabidopsis genomic DNA template using primers JH3_XmaI_F and JH3_XmaI_R (supplemental Table S1). Subsequent ligation into the XmaI site of yeast expression vector pYeDP60 was followed by transformation into Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11 strain (46.Pompon D. Louerat B. Bronine A. Urban P.

We have found that MEDI4893 recognizes a novel epitope in the so-called “rim” domain of AT and exerts its neutralizing effect through a dual mechanism. In particular, MEDI4893 not only sterically blocks binding of AT to its cell receptor but also prevents it from adopting a lytic heptameric trans-membrane conformation."

SeaMaST is a freely available evidence source for use by all connected to the offshore wind industry and will assist statutory agencies in assessing potential risks to seabird populations from planned developments. Data were compiled from offshore boat and aerial observer surveys spanning the period 1979–2012. The data were analysed using distance analysis and Density Surface Modelling to produce predicted bird densities across a grid covering English territorial waters at a resolution of 3 km×3 km. Coefficients of Variation were estimated for each grid cell density, as an indication of confidence in predictions. Offshore wind farm sensitivity scores were compiled for seabird species using English territorial waters. The comparative risks to each species of collision with turbines and displacement from operational turbines were reviewed and scored separately, and the scores were multiplied by the bird density estimates to produce relative sensitivity maps. The sensitivity maps reflected well the amassed distributions of the most sensitive species. SeaMaST is an important new tool for assessing potential impacts on seabird populations from offshore development at a time when multiple large areas of development are proposed which overlap with many seabird species’ ranges. It will inform marine spatial planning as well as identifying priority areas of sea usage by marine birds. Example SeaMaST outputs are presented."

The rotarod and Barnes maze acquisition and probe tests were performed within 2 wk after injury, with another probe test performed 3 mo postinjury. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analyses were performed on lipid extracts from several brain regions and plasma from injured and control mice collected at 3 mo postinjury.

Ether PE levels were lower in the cortices and plasma of injured animals. Polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PC and PE species, particularly ratios of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to arachidonic acid, were lower in the hippocampi and cortices and plasma of injured mice.

However, there are interindividual differences in the analgesic effect of changing the visual body image. We hypothesized that a negative body image associated with changing the visual body appearance causes interindividual differences in the analgesic effect although the relationship between the visual body appearance and analgesic effect has not been clarified. We investigated whether a negative body image associated with changes in the visual body appearance increased pain. Twenty-five healthy individuals participated in this study. To evoke a negative body image, we applied the method of rubber hand illusion. We created an “injured rubber hand” to evoke unpleasantness associated with pain, a “hairy rubber hand” to evoke unpleasantness associated with embarrassment, and a “twisted rubber hand” to evoke unpleasantness associated with deviation from the concept of normality. We also created a “normal rubber hand” as a control. The pain threshold was measured while the participant observed the rubber hand using a device that measured pain caused by thermal stimuli. Body ownership experiences were elicited by observation of the injured rubber hand and hairy rubber hand as well as the normal rubber hand. Participants felt more unpleasantness by observing the injured rubber hand and hairy rubber hand than the normal rubber hand and twisted rubber hand (p<0.001).

CYP2C and CYP3A drug-metabolizing enzymes play a critical role in determining the pharmacokinetics of the majority of prescribed medications. These enzymes are transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear receptors pregnane X receptor (PXR) and hepatic nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α). Expression of CYP2C and CYP3A is decreased in CKD; however, the mechanisms by which this occurs is unknown. We induced CKD in rats by 5/6 nephrectomy and used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine nuclear receptor- and epigenetic alteration-mediated differences in the promoter region of the CYP2C and CYP3A genes. RNA polymerase II and HNF-4α binding was decreased 76 and 57% in the CYP2C11 promotor and 71 and 77% in the CYP3A2 promoter, respectively (P<0.05). ChIP also revealed a 57% decrease in PXR binding to the CYP3A2 promoter in CKD rats (P<0.05). The decrease in PXR and HNF-4α binding was accompanied by diminished histone 4 acetylation in the CYP3A2 promoter (48%) and histone 3 acetylation in the CYP2C11 (77%) and CYP3A2 (77%) promoter loci for nuclear receptor activation (P<0.05).

The crystal structure of CYP142A2 in complex with cholesteryl sulfate revealed a substrate tightly fit into a smaller active site than was previously observed for the complex of CYP125A1 with 4-cholesten-3-one. We propose that the larger CYP125 active site allows for multiple binding modes of cholesteryl sulfate, the majority of which trigger the P450 catalytic cycle, but in an uncoupled mode rather than one that oxidizes the sterol. In contrast, the more unhindered and compact CYP142 structure enables enzymes of this family to readily oxidize cholesteryl esters, thus providing an additional source of carbon for mycobacterial growth.

https://openalex.org/W2091247925,"To prime reverse transcription of Moloney murine leukaemia virus, a transfer RNA molecule must bind two regions of the retroviral RNA, the primer binding site (PBS) and primer activation signal within the U5-PBS; here, the NMR structures of the U5-PBS RNA and tRNA primer are solved, with and without the retroviral nucleocapsid protein, which remodels these regions. Retroviruses preferentially use specific host tRNAs as primers for the first step of reverse transcription. Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MLV) uses tRNAPro, which binds to two regions of the retroviral RNA (U5-PBS and PAS). Victoria D'Souza and colleagues have solved NMR structures of the U5-PBS RNA and tRNA primer, with and without retroviral nucleocapsid protein, to understand how it remodels these regions as part of the priming process. In contrast to other ATP-independent nucleocapsid chaperones that bind many RNA sites with low affinity, this retroviral protein uses an entropy-driven capture-and-release remodelling mechanism where few sites are bound with high affinity. This results in local destabilization of the regions specifically required for the intermolecular interaction. To prime reverse transcription, retroviruses require annealing of a transfer RNA molecule to the U5 primer binding site (U5-PBS) region of the viral genome1,2. The residues essential for primer annealing are initially locked in intramolecular interactions3,4,5; hence, annealing requires the chaperone activity of the retroviral nucleocapsid (NC) protein to facilitate structural rearrangements6. Here we show that, unlike classical chaperones, the Moloney murine leukaemia virus NC uses a unique mechanism for remodelling: it specifically targets multiple structured regions in both the U5-PBS and tRNAPro primer that otherwise sequester residues necessary for annealing. This high-specificity and high-affinity binding by NC consequently liberates these sequestered residues—which are exactly complementary—for intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, NC utilizes a step-wise, entropy-driven mechanism to trigger both residue-specific destabilization and residue-specific release. Our structures of NC bound to U5-PBS and tRNAPro reveal the structure-based mechanism for retroviral primer annealing and provide insights as to how ATP-independent chaperones can target specific RNAs amidst the cellular milieu of non-target RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2046400987,"Ral GTPases are critical effectors of Ras, yet the molecular mechanism by which they induce malignant transformation is not well understood. In this study, we found the expression of K-Ras, RalB, and sometimes RalA, but not AKT1/2 and c-Raf, to be required for maintaining low levels of p53 in human cancer cells that harbor mutant K-Ras and wild-type p53. Down-regulation of K-Ras, RalB, and sometimes RalA increases p53 protein levels and results in a p53-dependent up-regulation of the expression of p21(WAF). K-Ras, RalA, and RalB depletion increases p53 stability as demonstrated by ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase activation, increased Ser-15 phosphorylation, and a significant (up to 6-fold) increase in p53 half-life. Furthermore, depletion of K-Ras and RalB inhibits anchorage-independent growth and invasion and interferes with cell cycle progression in a p53-dependent manner. Depletion of RalA inhibits invasion in a p53-dependent manner. Thus, expression of K-Ras and RalB and possibly RalA proteins is critical for maintaining low levels of p53, and down-regulation of these GTPases reactivates p53 by significantly enhancing its stability, and this contributes to suppression of malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2015502798,"Recently, salusin-β has been reported to have pro-atherosclerotic effects, but salusin-α has anti-atherosclerotic effects. Our previous study has shown that salusin-β but not salusin-α promotes vascular inflammation in apoE-deficient mice. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we observed the effect of salusins on inflammatory responses and the MAPK-NF-κB signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).HUVECs were incubated with different concentrations of salusin-α and salusin-β. The levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expressions of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein expressions of VCAM-1, MCP-1, I-κBα, NF-κB, p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK were measured using western blotting analysis. Our results showed that in HUVECs, salusin-β could up-regulate the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and MCP-1, promote I-κBα degradation and NF-κB activation, and increase the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAPK. These effects could be inhibited by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and/or JNK inhibitor SP600125. In contrast, salusin-α could selectively decrease VCAM-1 protein, but did not show any effect on the expressions of VCAM-1 mRNA, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, I-κBα, NF-κB, p-JNK or p-p38 MAPK.Salusin-β was able to promote inflammatory responses in HUVECs via the p38 MAPK-NF-κB and JNK-NF-κB pathways. In contrast, salusin-α failed to show any significant effects on the inflammatory responses in HUVECs. These results provide further insight into the mechanisms behind salusins in vascular inflammation and offer a potential target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2054844019,"The catalytic activity of cytochrome c (cyt c) to peroxidize cardiolipin to its oxidized form is required for the release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria, and for execution of the subsequent apoptotic steps. However, the structural basis for this peroxidation reaction remains unclear. In this paper, we determined the three-dimensional NMR solution structure of yeast cyt c Y67H variant with high peroxidase activity, which is almost similar to that of its native form. The structure reveals that the hydrogen bond between Met80 and residue 67 is disrupted. This change destabilizes the sixth coordination bond between heme Fe3+ ion and Met80 sulfur atom in the Y67H variant, and further makes it more easily be broken at low pH conditions. The steady-state studies indicate that the Y67H variant has the highest peroxidase activities when pH condition is between 4.0 and 5.2. Finally, a mechanism is suggested for the peroxidation of cardiolipin catalyzed by the Y67H variant, where the residue His67 acts as a distal histidine, its protonation facilitates O-O bond cleavage of H2O2 by functioning as an acidic catalyst."

Skin prick test (SPT) and ELISA were performed using a panel of inhalant, fruit and nut allergens. ELISA and ELISA inhibition studies were performed in order to analyse the sensitization patterns.Thirty-five cases (43.2%) had OAS and 46 (56.8%) GS. SPT showed a significantly higher number of positive results with peach, cherry and hazelnut in those with GS. ELISA showed a significantly high percentage of positive cases to rMal d 3, rMal d 4, rPru p 3 and Pho d 2 in patients with OAS and GS compared to controls, and to rBet v 1 in patients with OAS vs controls and between OAS and GS patients. Three different patterns of recognition were detected: positive to LTP (rMal d 3 or rPru p 3), positive to profilin (rMal d 4 and Pho d 2), or positive to both. There were also patients with rMal d 1 recognition who showed cross-reactivity to rBet v 1.In an apple allergy population with a high incidence of pollinosis different patterns of sensitization may occur. LTP is most often involved in those with GS. Profilin, though more prevalent in patients with OAS, has been shown to sensitise patients with both types of symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2024490794,"DNA methylation is a well-characterized epigenetic modification that plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. There is growing evidence on the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in disease onset, including cancer. Environmental factors seem to induce changes in DNA methylation affecting human health. However, little is known about basal methylation levels in healthy people and about the correlation between environmental factors and different methylation profiles. We investigated the effect of seasonality on basal methylation by testing methylation levels in the long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) and in two cancer-related genes (RASSF1A and MGMT) of 88 healthy male heavy smokers involved in an Italian randomized study; at enrolment the subjects donated a blood sample collected in different months. Methylation analyses were performed by pyrosequencing. Mean methylation percentage was higher in spring and summer for the LINE1, RASSF1A and MGMT genes (68.26%, 2.35%, and 9.52% respectively) compared with autumn and winter (67.43%, 2.17%, and 8.60% respectively). In particular, LINE-1 was significantly hypomethylated (p = 0.04 or 0.05 depending on the CpG island involved) in autumn and winter compared with spring and summer. Seasonality seems to be a modifier of methylation levels and this observation should be taken into account in future analyses."

We applied computer-assisted scanning and analytic approaches to immuno-stained CIN lesion sections to more accurately delineate disease states and decipher cell proliferation impacts from HPV and smoking within individual epithelial layers. A patient cohort undergoing cervical screening was identified (n = 196) and biopsies of varying disease grades and with intact basement membranes and epithelial layers were obtained (n = 261). Specimens were sectioned, stained (Mib1), and scanned using a high-resolution imaging system. We achieved semi-automated delineation of proliferation status and epithelial cell layers using Otsu segmentation, manual image review, Voronoi tessellation, and immuno-staining. Data were interrogated against known status for HPV infection, smoking, and disease grade. We observed increased cell proliferation and decreased epithelial thickness with increased disease grade (when analyzing the epithelium at full thickness). Analysis within individual cell layers showed a ≥50% increase in cell proliferation for CIN2 vs. CIN1 lesions in higher epithelial layers (with minimal differences seen in basal/parabasal layers). Higher rates of proliferation for HPV-positive vs. -negative cases were seen in epithelial layers beyond the basal/parabasal layers in normal and CIN1 tissues. Comparing smokers vs. non-smokers, we observed increased cell proliferation in parabasal (low and high grade lesions) and basal layers (high grade only). In sum, we report CIN grade-specific differences in cell proliferation within individual epithelial layers. We also show HPV and smoking impacts on cell layer-specific proliferation. Our findings yield insight into CIN progression biology and demonstrate that rigorous, semi-automated imaging of histopathological specimens may be applied to improve disease grading accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2026170022,"Research in host-parasite evolutionary ecology has demonstrated that environmental variation plays a large role in mediating the outcome of parasite infection. For example, crowding or low food availability can reduce host condition and make them more vulnerable to parasite infection. This observation that poor-condition hosts often suffer more from parasite infection compared to healthy hosts has led to the assumption that parasite productivity is higher in poor-condition hosts. However, the ubiquity of this negative relationship between host condition and parasite fitness is unknown. Moreover, examining the effect of environmental variation on parasite fitness has been largely overlooked in the host-parasite literature. Here we investigate the relationship between parasite fitness and host condition by using a laboratory experiment with the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni and its viral pathogen, AcMNPV, and by surveying published host-parasite literature. Our experiments demonstrated that virus productivity was positively correlated with host food availability and the literature survey revealed both positive and negative relationships between host condition and parasite fitness. Together these data demonstrate that contrary to previous assumptions, parasite fitness can be positively or negatively correlated with host fitness. We discuss the significance of these findings for host-parasite population biology."
https://openalex.org/W2049224195,"The Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex contains multiple copies of three enzymatic components, E1p, E2p, and E3, that sequentially carry out distinct steps in the overall reaction converting pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Efficient functioning requires the enzymatic components to assemble into a large complex, the integrity of which is maintained by tethering of the displaced, peripheral E1p and E3 components to the E2p core through non-covalent binding. We here report the crystal structure of a subcomplex between E1p and an E2p didomain containing a hybrid lipoyl domain along with the peripheral subunit-binding domain responsible for tethering to the core. In the structure, a region at the N terminus of each subunit in the E1p homodimer previously unseen due to crystallographic disorder was observed, revealing a new folding motif involved in E1p-E2p didomain interactions, and an additional, unexpected, flexibility was discovered in the E1p-E2p didomain subcomplex, both of which probably have consequences in the overall multienzyme complex assembly. This represents the first structure of an E1p-E2p didomain subcomplex involving a homodimeric E1p, and the results may be applicable to a large range of complexes with homodimeric E1 components. Results of HD exchange mass spectrometric experiments using the intact, wild type 3-lipoyl E2p and E1p are consistent with the crystallographic data obtained from the E1p-E2p didomain subcomplex as well as with other biochemical and NMR data reported from our groups, confirming that our findings are applicable to the entire E1p-E2p assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2095110809,"Many bacteria exist in a state of feast or famine where high nutrient availability leads to periods of growth followed by nutrient scarcity and growth stagnation. To adapt to the constantly changing nutrient flux, metabolite acquisition systems must be able to function over a broad range. This, however, creates difficulties as nutrient concentrations vary over many orders of magnitude, requiring metabolite acquisition systems to simultaneously balance ligand specificity and the dynamic range in which a response to a metabolite is elicited. Here we present how a gene duplication of a periplasmic binding protein in a mannose ATP-binding cassette transport system potentially resolves this dilemma through gene functionalization. Determination of ligand binding affinities and specificities of the gene duplicates with fluorescence and circular dichroism demonstrates that although the binding specificity is maintained the Kd values for the same ligand differ over three orders of magnitude. These results suggest that this metabolite acquisition system can transport ligand at both low and high environmental concentrations while preventing saturation with related and less preferentially metabolized compounds. The x-ray crystal structures of the β-mannose-bound proteins help clarify the structural basis of gene functionalization and reveal that affinity and specificity are potentially encoded in different regions of the binding site. These studies suggest a possible functional role and adaptive advantage for the presence of two periplasmic-binding proteins in ATP-binding cassette transport systems and a way bacteria can adapt to varying nutrient flux through functionalization of gene duplicates."
https://openalex.org/W2037198875,"Nuclear RNA degradation pathways are highly conserved across eukaryotes and play important roles in RNA quality control. Key substrates for exosomal degradation include aberrant functional RNAs and cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs). It has recently been reported that the nuclear exosome is inactivated during meiosis in budding yeast through degradation of the subunit Rrp6, leading to the stabilisation of a subset of meiotic unannotated transcripts (MUTs) of unknown function. We have analysed the activity of the nuclear exosome during meiosis by deletion of TRF4, which encodes a key component of the exosome targeting complex TRAMP. We find that TRAMP mutants produce high levels of CUTs during meiosis that are undetectable in wild-type cells, showing that the nuclear exosome remains functional for CUT degradation, and we further report that the meiotic exosome complex contains Rrp6. Indeed Rrp6 over-expression is insufficient to suppress MUT transcripts, showing that the reduced amount of Rrp6 in meiotic cells does not directly cause MUT accumulation. Lack of TRAMP activity stabilises ∼1600 CUTs in meiotic cells, which occupy 40% of the binding capacity of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). CBC mutants display defects in the formation of meiotic double strand breaks (DSBs), and we see similar defects in TRAMP mutants, suggesting that a key function of the nuclear exosome is to prevent saturation of the CBC complex by CUTs. Together, our results show that the nuclear exosome remains active in meiosis and has an important role in facilitating meiotic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2171006813,"Purinergic signaling comprises one key pathway in modulating bladder smooth muscle (BSM) contractility, disorders of which become highly prevalent with aging. ADP was first observed to modulate BSM contractility >40 yr ago, yet the underlying molecular mechanism still remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate, using myography, that ADP and ADPβS dose-dependently induce mouse BSM contraction, and ADP-induced BSM contraction is blocked by a selective P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R) antagonist, PSB 0739 (25 μM), but is unaffected by P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptor antagonists. P2Y12R in BSM exhibits distinct pharmacological properties that are different from P2Y12R in platelets. After an immediate contraction, prolonged exposure to ADP causes BSM to become refractory to further ADP-mediated contraction. However, in mice lacking ectonucleotidases Entpd1 (ATP→ADP→AMP) or Nt5e (AMP→adenosine), or by inhibiting adenosine signaling, the refractory response was altered, resulting in repeated BSM contractions in response to repeated ADP (0.1-1 mM) stimulation. Our data indicate that P2Y12R undergoes slow desensitization; ADP-P2Y12 signaling is tightly regulated by Entpd1/Nt5e activity and adenosine receptors; and ADP-adenosine signaling play an important role in modulating P2X-mediated BSM contraction. The identification of P2Y12R in BSM, and the current clinical availability of P2Y12R inhibitors, such as clopidogrel, offers potentially novel treatment strategies for bladder contractility disorders.—Yu, W., Sun, X., Robson, S.

The rationale for using NFAI subjects is dual: i) their baseline hormone profiles do not differ from those of healthy subjects and ii) hormone levels after stimulation tests are available.The carriers (N = 27) of a well-defined CYP21A2 haplotype cluster (c5) had significantly elevated levels of cortisol (p = 0.0110), and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (p = 0.0001) after ACTH stimulation, and 11-deoxycortisol after metyrapone administration (p = 0.0017), but the hormone values were in normal ranges. In addition, the carriers (N = 33) of the C allele of the rs6462 polymorphism had a higher baseline aldosterone level (p = 0.0006). The prevalence of these genetic variants of CYP21A2 did not differ between NFAI and healthy subjects.The common CYP21A2 variants presumably exert the same effect on hormone levels in the healthy and disease-affected populations.

https://openalex.org/W1985454782,"The use of microfluidics in live cell imaging allows the acquisition of dense time-series from individual cells that can be perturbed through computer-controlled changes of growth medium. Systems and synthetic biologists frequently perform gene expression studies that require changes in growth conditions to characterize the stability of switches, the transfer function of a genetic device, or the oscillations of gene networks. It is rarely possible to know a priori at what times the various changes should be made, and the success of the experiment is unknown until all of the image processing is completed well after the completion of the experiment. This results in wasted time and resources, due to the need to repeat the experiment to fine-tune the imaging parameters. To overcome this limitation, we have developed an adaptive imaging platform called GenoSIGHT that processes images as they are recorded, and uses the resulting data to make real-time adjustments to experimental conditions. We have validated this closed-loop control of the experiment using galactose-inducible expression of the yellow fluorescent protein Venus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that adaptive imaging improves the reproducibility of gene expression data resulting in more accurate estimates of gene network parameters while increasing productivity ten-fold."

Two isoforms of the β4-GalNAc-transferases, T3 and T4 (β4GalNAc-T3, β4GalNAc-T4), were described to be responsible for protein-specific LacdiNAc synthesis (17.Sato T. Gotoh M. Kiyohara K. Kameyama A.

The group of Baenziger and co-workers (2.Miller E. Fiete D. Blake N.M. Beranek M. Oates E.L. Mi Y. Roseman D.S. Baenziger J.U. A necessary and sufficient determinant for protein-selective glycosylation in vivo.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1985-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) provided evidence that for induction of β4GalNAc-T3 and -T4 activities, a 19-meric peptide sequence within the target protein (LRRFIEQKITKRKKEKYWP) is necessary and sufficient. This determining cis-located peptide is characterized by a high content of basic amino acids and an α-helical structure. It is located at the C terminus of carbonic anhydrase VI and could induce the modification of N-linked chains on a normally unmodified protein (transferrin) after recombinant translocation of the peptide. We recently obtained evidence that the human Trefoil factor 2 (hTFF2 or TFF2) expressed in gastric mucosal secretions carries exclusively fucosylated LacdiNAc antennae on a biantennary N-linked chain located at Asn-38 in loop 1 of the N-terminal P1 TFF domain (19.Hanisch F.-G. Ragge H. Kalinski T. Meyer F. Kalbacher H. Hoffmann W. Human gastric TFF2 peptide contains an N-linked fucosylated N,N′-diacetyllactosediamine (LacdiNAc) oligosaccharide.Glycobiology. 2013; 23: 2-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). No obvious microheterogeneity of N-glycosylation became apparent at this site except for a minor under-fucosylation of the LacdiNAc moieties pointing to a LacdiNAc inducing determinant with high stringency. Strikingly, the amino acid sequences of TFF2 downstream or upstream of the N-glycosylation site lack any similarities on the level of primary and secondary structures with the previously published LacdiNAc synthesis-inducing determinant. Based on this observation we hypothesized that a conformationally stabilized determinant, forming a structural part of TFF domains, may have LacdiNAc-inducing capacities. To prove this assumption we expressed TFF2 as a recombinant full-length probe in HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells represent a well established cellular model in the context of LacdiNAc biosynthesis (20.Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D.

These two enzymes do not compete with other β4GalNAc-Ts, the isoenzymes T1 and T2, which are involved in ganglioside biosynthesis by converting GM2 to GD2 (β4GalNAc-T1) or in the Sda/Cad blood-group synthesis (β4GalNAc-T2). However, a competition with β4Gal-T1 (lactose synthase), the enzyme involved in LacNAc synthesis, has certainly to be expected as this enzyme uses the same substrates. Besides a full-length wild type probe (hTFF2-Fl), we generated a series of truncation probes in HEK-293 cells corresponding to the N-terminal TFF domain P1 (N-P1, carrying the natural N-glycosylation site) or to the C-terminal TFF domain P2 (C-P2*, carrying a designed new N-glycosylation site). Moreover, we generated and expressed the Cys/Gly mutant variants with defective TFF domains TFF2-Fl-(C52G) and TFF2-Fl-(C42G) and a double point mutant lacking aromatic residues within a putative hydrophobic patch N-P1-(W68Q/F59Q). Based on these glycosylation probes and mass spectrometric analyses of their N/O-glycoprofiles, we could provide evidence that the LacdiNAc-inducing capacity is actually confined to conformationally intact TFF domains and that this capacity is strictly dependent on highly conserved aromatic residues in loop 3 of the TFF domains, which form essential components of a hydrophobic cleft with putative protein binding capacity. The applied chemicals were generally purchased from Sigma. The quality was for analysis. Deviations are indicated. DNA, primers, and proteins were handled at +4 °C or on ice, and long time storage was at −20 °C or −80 °C. The template for the generation of TFF2 constructs was a plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the 129-amino acid comprising human TFF2 precursor protein (GenBankTM accession number BC032820.1). The full-length recombinant construct (TFF2-Fl, p24- p129), the N-terminal TFF domain P1 (N-P1, p24-p78), and the C-terminal TFF domain P2 (C-P2, p74-p129) were generated as secretory fusion proteins without their endogenous N-terminal signal peptide (p1-p23) using the following primers (BioTeZ, Berlin, Germany): full-length and N-P1, C-P2 constructs: Fwd1, AATTCTAGAAGAGAAACCCTCCCCCTGCCAG; Fwd2, AATTCTAGAACCAAAGCAAGAGTCGGATCAG; Rev1, TGTAGATCTGTAATGGCAGTCTTCCACAGA; Rev2, TGTAGATCTCGACTCTTGCTTTGGGAGGGG. PCR amplification was conducted by utilizing overhang primers with a non-complimentary 3′-extension including recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes XbaI and BglII. The digested PCR products were cloned into the eukaryotic pCEP-Pu vector V59 designed for the expression of C-terminally tagged (octa-His and STREP) secretory fusion proteins. Site-directed mutations were introduced with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. Cys-42 and Cys-52, respectively, were exchanged for Gly in TFF2-Fl, and a novel N-glycosylation site was generated in the otherwise N-glycosylation-negative P2 domain by mutation of Asp-87 to Asn-87 and Arg-89 to Thr-89 in one step using the following primers: TFF2-Fl-(C42/G), Fwd CATAACAGGACGAACGGCGGCTTCCCT; TFF2-Fl-(C52G), Fwd ATCACCAGTGACCAGGTGTTTGACAAT; C-P2*-(D87N/R89T), Fwd TGCGTCATGGAGGTCTCAAACCGAACAAACTGTGGCTACC. The construct N-P1-(W68Q/F59Q) was synthesized by GeneArt-Life Technologies (Invitrogen, Regensburg, Germany) and ligated into V59 vector as above. A schematic view of the generated glycosylation probes is given in Fig. 1. Culture media and cell culture flasks were purchased from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 (Invitrogen) was cultivated at 37 °C and 5% CO2, humidified in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM), and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) was utilized for all transfection procedures. Selection of transfected cells was established with 5 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma) as an additional culture media supplement. At a confluence of ∼80% cells were triple rinsed with PBS and kept in culture for 3 days in medium lacking FCS. Supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until purification of recombinant protein via affinity tag. 500 ml of supernatants were centrifuged for 15 min at 10000 rpm, +4 °C. 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm imidazole, 25 µl of PMSF (1 m in DMSO) were added. The pH was adjusted to 8.0 at +4 °C with HCl. Supernatant was then passed through a cellulose filter and applied to the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column twice in a row. For detailed description of the procedure refer to Breloy et al. (16.Breloy I. Pacharra S. Ottis P. Bonar D. Grahn A. Hanisch F.-G.

Eluted fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled then concentrated and desalted via Amicon centrifugation units, molecular mass cutoff 10 kDa (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Aliquots of the recombinantly expressed fusion proteins were treated before Western blot analysis by thrombin digestion to remove the strep tag. Proteins in 5–20% or 15% SDS gels were either stained with silver or blotted onto nitrocellulose (Protran BA 83, Schleicher & Schüll) in a wet blot transfer cell (Bio-Rad) for antibody detection or onto PVDF membranes in a semidry blot chamber (both from Bio-Rad) for lectin detection (16.Breloy I.

Modification with LacdiNAc was tested either with the monoclonal mouse antibody 273–372 (kindly provided by Dr. C. H. Hokke, Leiden University Medical Clinic, Leiden, The Netherlands; 1:5 diluted culture supernatant, 2 h at ambient temperature) or with biotinylated Wisteria floribunda lectin (Sigma, 10 µg/ml, 2 h at ambient temperature). Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) was applied as a secondary antibody or Strep-tactin-HRP (IBA) for staining of lectin binding. Immunolabeled protein was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Applied Science). An aliquot of the full-length probe hTFF2-Fl was pretreated with 0.1 m aqueous TFA at 80 °C for 1 h to chemically desialinate and partially defucosylate the glycoprotein before W. floribunda (WFA) staining. Intact probes (1 µg of protein) were digested with chymotrypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 4 h using an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w). After heat denaturation of the protease (10 min at 90 °C), the resulting peptide mixture was further digested with trypsin (both enzymes were sequencing grade from Promega (Mannheim, Germany)) in the same buffer at 37 °C overnight using a 1:50 enzyme substrate ratio (w/w). After reduction of disulfides and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues, peptides were analyzed by LC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as described (22.Albert T.K. Laubinger W. Müller S.

Trypsin was inactivated at 95 °C for 5 min. Digested sample was dried by vacuum centrifugation and solubilized in 50 µl of 50 mm NH4HCO3. An aliquot of 0.5 µl of peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) was added, and N-deglycosylation was performed at 37 °C for at least 16 h. Liberated N-glycans were separated from peptides by solid-phase extraction on C18 cartridges (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). N-Glycans in the flow-through were dried by vacuum rotation and in a desiccator for 1 h in the presence of P2O5/KOH. Methylation was performed in 100 µl of water-free DMSO containing finely dispersed NaOH (30 min at 22 °C) followed by the addition of 50 µl of methyliodide (30 min at 22 °C). After methylation, 300 µl of chloroform was added, and the sample was repeatedly extracted with 200 µl of water. The chloroform phase was dried under N2, and methylated glycans were solved in 20 µl of methanol. The glycan chains were released from the protein by reductive β-elimination. For this purpose the glycoproteins were incubated with 1.0 m NaBH4 in 50 mm NaOH for 18 h at 50 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 µl of acetic acid. Salt was removed with 100 µl of Dowex 50WX8 aqueous suspension (Bio-Rad) in a batch procedure. Excessive borate was co-distilled as methyl ester in a stream of nitrogen by adding several 0.1-ml aliquots of 1% acetic acid in methanol. Permethylation of the glycan chains was performed as described above and in Breloy et al. (16.Breloy I. Pacharra S. Ottis P. Bonar D. Grahn A. Hanisch F.-G.

Peptide samples were analyzed after co-crystallization of aqueous solutions in 0.1% TFA, 50% acetonitrile and a saturated matrix solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in the same solvent. Analyses were performed by positive ion detection in the reflectron mode. Ionization of co-crystallized analytes was induced with a pulsed Smart-beam laser (accumulation of ∼5000 shots), and the ions were accelerated in a field of 20 kV and reflected at 23 kV. MALDI-MS/MS was performed by analysis of post-source decay fragments in the laser-induced dissociation mode. Fragment annotation of glycans was assisted by application of the GlycoWorkbench tool (23.Ceroni A. Maass K. Geyer H. Geyer R. Dell A. Haslam S.M.

The sample was separated on an analytical C18 column (75 µm × 10 cm) using gradient runs from 0 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA during 30 min. Ions were scanned with 8100 atomic mass units/s in a range from m/z 300 to 2500 in MS mode and m/z 200 to 3000 in MS/MS mode. MS/MS spectra were generated by collision-induced dissociation fragmentation (16.Breloy I. Pacharra S. Ottis P. Bonar D. Grahn A. Hanisch F.-G.

This implies that an ideal vaccine should induce protective immune responses both at systemic and mucosal sites to counteract invasive mucosal pathogens. We evaluated the in vivo systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune response induced in mice by intramuscular administration of an integrase defective lentiviral vector (IDLV) carrying the ovalbumin (OVA) transgene as a model antigen (IDLV-OVA), either alone or in combination with sublingual adjuvanted OVA protein. Mice immunized intramuscularly with OVA and adjuvant were compared with IDLV-OVA immunization. Mice sublingually immunized only with OVA and adjuvant were used as a positive control of mucosal responses. A single intramuscular dose of IDLV-OVA induced functional antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in spleen, draining and distal lymph nodes and, importantly, in the lamina propria of the large intestine. These results were similar to those obtained in a prime-boost regimen including one IDLV immunization and two mucosal boosts with adjuvanted OVA or vice versa. Remarkably, only in groups vaccinated with IDLV-OVA, either alone or in prime-boost regimens, the mucosal CD8+ T cell response persisted up to several months from immunization. Importantly, following IDLV-OVA immunization, the mucosal boost with protein greatly increased the plasma IgG response and induced mucosal antigen-specific IgA in saliva and vaginal washes. Overall, intramuscular administration of IDLV followed by protein boosts using the sublingual route induced strong, persistent and complementary systemic and mucosal immune responses, and represents an appealing prime-boost strategy for immunization including IDLV as a delivery system."
https://openalex.org/W2136017890,"Background Neonatal trials remain difficult to conduct for several reasons: in particular the need for study sites to have an existing infrastructure in place, with trained investigators and validated quality procedures to ensure good clinical, laboratory practices and a respect for high ethical standards. The objective of this work was to identify the major criteria considered necessary for selecting neonatal intensive care units that are able to perform drug evaluations competently. Methodology and Main Findings This Delphi process was conducted with an international multidisciplinary panel of 25 experts from 13 countries, selected to be part of two committees (a scientific committee and an expert committee), in order to validate criteria required to perform drug evaluation in neonates. Eighty six items were initially selected and classified under 7 headings: “NICUs description - Level of care” (21), “Ability to perform drug trials: NICU organization and processes (15), “Research Experience” (12), “Scientific competencies and area of expertise” (8), “Quality Management” (16), “Training and educational capacity” (8) and “Public involvement” (6). Sixty-one items were retained and headings were rearranged after the first round, 34 were selected after the second round. A third round was required to validate 13 additional items. The final set includes 47 items divided under 5 headings. Conclusion A set of 47 relevant criteria will help to NICUs that want to implement, conduct or participate in drug trials within a neonatal network identify important issues to be aware of. Summary Points 1) Neonatal trials remain difficult to conduct for several reasons: in particular the need for study sites to have an existing infrastructure in place, with trained investigators and validated quality procedures to ensure good clinical, laboratory practices and a respect for high ethical standards. 2) The present Delphi study was conducted with an international multidisciplinary panel of 25 experts from 13 countries and aims to identify the major criteria considered necessary for selecting neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) that are able to perform drug evaluations competently. 3) Of the 86 items initially selected and classified under 7 headings - “NICUs description - Level of care” (21), “Ability to perform drug trials: NICU organization and processes (15), “Research Experience” (12), “Scientific competencies and area of expertise” (8), “Quality Management” (16), “Training and educational capacity” (8) and “Public involvement” (6) - 47 items were selected following a three rounds Delphi process. 4) The present consensus will help NICUs to implement, conduct or participate in drug trials within a neonatal network."
https://openalex.org/W2013324131,"We have carried out a systematic computational analysis on a representative dataset of proteins of known three-dimensional structure, in order to evaluate whether it would possible to 'swap' certain short peptide sequences in naturally occurring proteins with their corresponding 'inverted' peptides and generate 'artificial' proteins that are predicted to retain native-like protein fold. The analysis of 3,967 representative proteins from the Protein Data Bank revealed 102,677 unique identical inverted peptide sequence pairs that vary in sequence length between 5-12 and 18 amino acid residues. Our analysis illustrates with examples that such 'artificial' proteins may be generated by identifying peptides with 'similar structural environment' and by using comparative protein modeling and validation studies. Our analysis suggests that natural proteins may be tolerant to accommodating such peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2074004742,"To investigate the genetic mechanism of mercury accumulation in maize (Zea mays L.), a population of 194 recombinant inbred lines derived from an elite hybrid Yuyu 22, was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mercury accumulation at two locations. The results showed that the average Hg concentration in the different tissues of maize followed the order: leaves > bracts > stems > axis > kernels. Twenty-three QTLs for mercury accumulation in five tissues were detected on chromosomes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10, which explained 6.44% to 26.60% of the phenotype variance. The QTLs included five QTLs for Hg concentration in kernels, three QTLs for Hg concentration in the axis, six QTLs for Hg concentration in stems, four QTLs for Hg concentration in bracts and five QTLs for Hg concentration in leaves. Interestingly, three QTLs, qKHC9a, qKHC9b, and qBHC9 were in linkage with two QTLs for drought tolerance. In addition, qLHC1 was in linkage with two QTLs for arsenic accumulation. The study demonstrated the concentration of Hg in Hg-contaminated paddy soil could be reduced, and maize production maintained simultaneously by selecting and breeding maize Hg pollution-safe cultivars (PSCs)."

That shape is not only the product of genetic design and of the physical and biochemical environment, but it is also subject to inheritance. However, the nature and contribution of cell shape inheritance to morphogenetic control is mostly ignored. Here, we investigate morphogenetic inheritance in the cylindrically-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Focusing on sixteen different ‘curved’ mutants - a class of mutants which often fail to grow axially straight – we quantitatively characterize their dynamics of cell shape inheritance throughout generations. We show that mutants of similar machineries display similar dynamics of cell shape inheritance, and exploit this feature to show that persistent axial cell growth in S. pombe is secured by multiple, separable molecular pathways. Finally, we find that one of those pathways corresponds to the swc2-swr1-vps71 SWR1/SRCAP chromatin remodelling complex, which acts additively to the known mal3-tip1-mto1-mto2 microtubule and tea1-tea2-tea4-pom1 polarity machineries."
https://openalex.org/W1994320795,"We investigated the relationships between the ALOX5AP gene rs10507391 and rs4769874 polymorphisms, serum levels of leukotriene (LT) B4, and risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).A total of 709 participants, comprising 508 ACS patients (ACS group) and 201 noncoronary artery disease patients with chest pain (control group) were recruited from the Han population of the Changwu region in China. Two polymorphic loci were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Serum LTB4 level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Serum LTB4 levels were significantly higher (P<0.001) in the ACS group (median/interquartile range, 470.27/316.32 pg/ml) than in the control group (233.05/226.82 pg/ml). No statistical differences were observed between genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies for the tested loci in either the ACS group or the control group, even after adjustments were made for conventional risk factors by multivariate logistic regression. This suggests there is no association between the ALOX5AP rs10507391 and rs4769874 polymorphisms and ACS risk. Elevated serum LTB4 level was closely linked to ACS risk, and may be independent of traditional risk factors as a risk factor for ACS (P<0.001). There was no significant association between serum LTB4 levels and the two variants in either the ACS group or the control group.Rs10507391, rs4769874 and its haplotypes in ALOX5AP are unrelated to ACS risk in the Chinese Han population of Changwu, but elevated serum LTB4 level is strongly associated with ACS risk. Serum LTB4 level is not subject to the influence of either the rs10507391, rs4769874 or the haplotype."
https://openalex.org/W2054154026,"Our goal is to understand the neural basis of functional impairment in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to be able to characterize clinically significant decline and assess therapeutic efficacy. We used frequency-tagged ERPs to word and motion stimuli to study the effects of stimulus conditions and selective attention. ERPs to word or motion increase when a task-irrelevant 2nd stimulus is added, but decrease when the task is moved to that 2nd stimulus. Spectral analyses show task effects on response power without 2nd stimulus effects. However, phase coherence shows both 2nd stimulus and task effects. Thus, power and coherence are dissociably modulated by stimulus and task effects. Task-dependent phase coherence successively declines in aging and AD. In contrast, task-dependent spectral power increases in aging, only to decrease in AD. We hypothesize that age-related declines in signal coherence, associated with increased power generation, stresses neurons and contributes to the loss of response power and the development of functional impairment in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2085272187,"Generalized estimating equation (GEE) algorithm under a heterogeneous residual variance model is an extension of the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method for continuous traits to discrete traits. In contrast to mixture model-based expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm, the GEE algorithm can well detect quantitative trait locus (QTL), especially large effect QTLs located in large marker intervals in the manner of high computing speed. Based on a single QTL model, however, the GEE algorithm has very limited statistical power to detect multiple QTLs because of ignoring other linked QTLs. In this study, the fast least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is derived for generalized linear model (GLM) with all possible link functions. Under a heterogeneous residual variance model, the LASSO for GLM is used to iteratively estimate the non-zero genetic effects of those loci over entire genome. The iteratively reweighted LASSO is therefore extended to mapping QTL for discrete traits, such as ordinal, binary, and Poisson traits. The simulated and real data analyses are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method to simultaneously identify multiple QTLs for binary and Poisson traits as examples."
