Here we investigated the detailed network organization of four individuals each scanned 24 times using MRI. We discovered that the distributed network known as the default network is comprised of two separate networks possessing adjacent regions in eight or more cortical zones. A distinction between the networks is that one is coupled to the hippocampal formation while the other is not. Further exploration revealed that these two networks were juxtaposed with additional networks that themselves fractionate group-defined networks. The collective networks display a repeating spatial progression in multiple cortical zones, suggesting that they are embedded within a broad macroscale gradient. Regions contributing to the newly defined networks are spatially variable across individuals and adjacent to distinct networks, raising issues for network estimation in group-averaged data and applied endeavors, including targeted neuromodulation.

The cerebral cortex possesses a complex tapestry of networks that interact and compete in the service of information processing. Building on a history of assigning specialized functions to brain regions, early seminal work by Norman Geschwind, Marsel Mesulam, and others proposed ideas about how distributed regions might interact to perform high-level tasks (e.g., Geschwind, 1965aGeschwind N.

Neurol. 1990; 28: 597-613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A leap in progress occurred when networks began to be conceptualized within the framework of anatomical connectivity patterns in the macaque, following the availability of both retrograde (Mesulam et al., 1977Mesulam M.M.

For example, by charting the laminar pattern of anatomical projections, a hierarchical pathway emerged from areas involved in visual perception through to areas enabling motor actions (Maunsell and van Essen, 1983Maunsell J.H. van Essen D.C.

This canonical distributed network comprises primary and secondary visual areas, parietal association areas, and motor areas. These interconnected areas form a partially modular distributed network that interacts with, but is anatomically distinguishable from, other processing hierarchies (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991Felleman D.J.

Neurol. 2014; 522: 225-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Notably, this canonical network involves areas distributed across temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. As will be illustrated below, this distributed pattern is a general motif that is apparent across multiple large-scale networks (see Goldman-Rakic, 1988Goldman-Rakic P.S. Topography of cognition: parallel distributed networks in primate association cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Human neuroimaging studies are particularly useful for characterizing distributed networks because they survey the whole brain at once. Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M. Shulman G.L. Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar highlighted a network currently known as the “dorsal attention network” (dATN) in the human neuroimaging literature, which is likely homologous to later-stage components of the sensory-motor hierarchy described above in the macaque (Vincent et al., 2007Vincent J.L. Patel G.H. Fox M.D. Snyder A.Z. Baker J.T. Van Essen D.C. Zempel J.M. Snyder L.H. Corbetta M. Raichle M.E.

Network analysis based on intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) consistently reveals the dATN (e.g., Fox et al., 2006Fox M.D. Corbetta M. Snyder A.Z. Vincent J.L. Raichle M.E.

Investigations into resting-state connectivity using independent component analysis.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2005; 360: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis in relation to retinotopic areas recapitulates, to first approximation, the full hierarchical pathway described in the macaque (Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D. Hollinshead M. Roffman J.L. Smoller J.W. Zöllei L. Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). Thus, while there are caveats to interpreting networks observed by FC (Buckner et al., 2013Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M.

Group-based studies using FC suggest that association cortex comprises about five major distributed networks (e.g., Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D.

Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 2753-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These networks have sufficiently modular properties to be consistently identified as isolated networks, even when constraints are relaxed to emphasize interactions between networks (Yeo et al., 2014Yeo B.T.T.

Estimates of segregation and overlap of functional connectivity networks in the human cerebral cortex.Neuroimage. 2014; 88: 212-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Among these, the “default network” (DN) has been extensively studied. The DN is anatomically separate from the dATN and is estimated to have expanded in hominin evolution (Buckner and Krienen, 2013Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M.

Similar patterns of cortical expansion during human development and evolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 13135-13140Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Regions across the DN are correlated to a level akin to the local sensory and motor networks despite being widely distributed (Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E.

Tracer studies suggest that the DN discovered in the human may have an anatomically connected homolog in the macaque (Buckner et al., 2008Buckner R.L. Andrews-Hanna J.R. Schacter D.L.

The evolution of distributed association networks in the human brain.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2013; 17: 648-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Several other networks, near the dATN and DN, each have their own distributed organization (Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D. Hollinshead M. Roffman J.L. Smoller J.W. Zöllei L. Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J.

Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 2753-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Several principles emerge through examining relations among multiple large-scale networks. First, the distributed networks all have an organization that is similar to the dATN and DN, with each network possessing frontal, temporal, posterior parietal, frontal midline, and posterior midline components. Depending on how the network is estimated, certain components can be underemphasized, e.g., the dATN is sometimes described without a frontal midline component, especially when “winner-take-all” network assignments are used (e.g., Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D. Hollinshead M. Roffman J.L. Smoller J.W. Zöllei L. Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). Targeted analyses often reveal there is a midline component (e.g., Figure 5 in Fox et al., 2006Fox M.D. Corbetta M. Snyder A.Z. Vincent J.L. Raichle M.E. Spontaneous neuronal activity distinguishes human dorsal and ventral attention systems.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10046-10051Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar; Figure 32 in Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D. Hollinshead M. Roffman J.L. Smoller J.W. Zöllei L. Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). The distributed networks follow a general motif that is roughly conserved even though each network contains spatially distinct regions. Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E. Functional network organization of the human brain.Neuron. 2011; 72: 665-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar further noted that the networks have similar spatial arrangements at their interfaces in multiple zones of cortex (e.g., temporal, parietal, frontal). That is, if a network lies side by side with another network in parietal cortex, it is also likely to do so in frontal cortex. This echoes features proposed by Goldman-Rakic, 1988Goldman-Rakic P.S. Topography of cognition: parallel distributed networks in primate association cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 137-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar (her Figure 4) and Mesulam, 1981Mesulam M.M. A cortical network for directed attention and unilateral neglect.Ann. Neurol. 1981; 10: 309-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar (his Figure 4) based on anatomical data. Second, while the broad architecture follows a general motif, there are differences that distinguish the networks. For example, while the dATN is coupled to visual and motor regions, the DN is instead coupled to the hippocampal formation, perhaps reflecting a mnemonic functional anchor (Greicius et al., 2004Greicius M.D. Srivastava G. Reiss A.L. Menon V. Default-mode network activity distinguishes Alzheimer’s disease from healthy aging: evidence from functional MRI.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4637-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar, Vincent et al., 2006Vincent J.L. Snyder A.Z. Fox M.D. Shannon B.J. Andrews J.R. Raichle M.E. Buckner R.L.

Functional-anatomic fractionation of the brain’s default network.Neuron. 2010; 65: 550-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). The discovery that cerebral association cortex possesses multiple distributed networks is a major milestone for the field. However, reliance on group-averaged estimates raises questions. A first open question concerns whether the present convergence on major networks reflects the correct level of description. Similarities between human neuroimaging and monkey anatomical findings suggest that the major networks described to date capture true organizational features. Nonetheless, several reports note distinctions that fractionate the larger major networks, either locally within a region or in complex ways across distributed regions. For example, Smith et al., 2013Smith S.M. Beckmann C.F. Andersson J. Auerbach E.J. Bijsterbosch J. Douaud G. Duff E. Feinberg D.A. Griffanti L. Harms M.P. et al.WU-Minn HCP ConsortiumResting-state fMRI in the Human Connectome Project.Neuroimage. 2013; 80: 144-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar presented a clustering analysis that illustrated both high-level structure that recapitulated the major networks and a substructure that included spatial distinctions between nearby regions of cortex (see also Smith et al., 2012Smith S.M. Miller K.L. Moeller S. Xu J. Auerbach E.J. Woolrich M.W. Beckmann C.F. Jenkinson M. Andersson J. Glasser M.F. et al.Temporally-independent functional modes of spontaneous brain activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 3131-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the study by Yeo et al., 2011Yeo B.T.T. Krienen F.M. Sepulcre J. Sabuncu M.R. Lashkari D. Hollinshead M. Roffman J.L. Smoller J.W. Zöllei L. Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, they showed that the major networks broke down further when more fine-grained network structure was examined (their 17-network parcellation). Power et al., 2011Power J.D. Cohen A.L. Nelson S.M. Wig G.S. Barnes K.A. Church J.A. Vogel A.C. Laumann T.O. Miezin F.M. Schlaggar B.L. Petersen S.E.

In detailed analysis of the DN, there have been several proposed schemes to delineate subnetworks (e.g., Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010Andrews-Hanna J.R. Reidler J.S. Sepulcre J. Poulin R. Buckner R.L.

Echoes of the brain: local-scale representation of whole-brain functional networks within transmodal cortex.Neuroscientist. 2015; 21: 540-551Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We do not attempt to integrate these various findings here but point out that analyses of group data have always possessed features that are not fully accommodated by assuming a small number of major networks. A second open question is whether there are global properties of organization that span across the networks. Margulies et al., 2016Margulies D.S. Ghosh S.S. Goulas A. Falkiewicz M. Huntenburg J.M. Langs G. Bezgin G. Eickhoff S.B. Castellanos F.X. Petrides M. et al.Situating the default-mode network along a principal gradient of macroscale cortical organization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: 12574-12579Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar recently proposed a macroscale organization of networks that moves outward from sensory-motor networks on one end to the DN on the other end. This echoes an idea advanced by Mesulam, 1998Mesulam M.M. From sensation to cognition.Brain. 1998; 121: 1013-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar that the cortex exhibits a hierarchical organization progressing from unimodal areas to integrative transmodal areas (see also Jones and Powell, 1970Jones E.G. Powell T.P. An anatomical study of converging sensory pathways within the cerebral cortex of the monkey.Brain. 1970; 93: 793-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The repeating motif and spatial juxtaposition of multiple networks suggest that the macroscale organization of the distributed networks might be partially explained by developmental anchors or gradients (Buckner and Krienen, 2013Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M. The evolution of distributed association networks in the human brain.Trends Cogn.

Human association cortex: expanded, untethered, neotenous, and plastic.in: Evolution of Nervous Systems 2e. Volume 4. Elsevier, 2017: 169-183Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of cortical network architecture may provide evidence for or against macroscale gradients that span networks. To make progress on these questions, we need to move from group-level description to the finer spatial scale that is accessible when studying organization within the individual. The majority of the literature on network architecture is based on averaging data from groups of spatially normalized individuals. Group averaging was necessary in positron emission tomography (PET) studies as radiation places severe restrictions on repeat imaging. A major technical breakthrough came with the ability to average brain volumes across individuals to boost signal to noise (e.g., Fox et al., 1985Fox P.T. Perlmutter J.S. Raichle M.E.

Functional variability refers to the spatial arrangement of functional zones on the cortical surface. Functional organization is likely derived from microscopic anatomical features, such as areal organization or anatomical subdomains that possess distinct connections.

https://openalex.org/W2737853846,"Progranulin (GRN) and TMEM106B are associated with several common neurodegenerative disorders including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). A TMEM106B variant modifies GRN-associated FTLD risk. However, their functional relationship in vivo and the mechanisms underlying the risk modification remain unclear. Here, using transcriptomic and proteomic analyses with Grn-/- and Tmem106b-/- mice, we show that, while multiple lysosomal enzymes are increased in Grn-/- brain at both transcriptional and protein levels, TMEM106B deficiency causes reduction in several lysosomal enzymes. Remarkably, Tmem106b deletion from Grn-/- mice normalizes lysosomal protein levels and rescues FTLD-related behavioral abnormalities and retinal degeneration without improving lipofuscin, C1q, and microglial accumulation. Mechanistically, TMEM106B binds vacuolar-ATPase accessory protein 1 (AP1). TMEM106B deficiency reduces vacuolar-ATPase AP1 and V0 subunits, impairing lysosomal acidification and normalizing lysosomal protein levels in Grn-/- neurons. Thus, Grn and Tmem106b genes have opposite effects on lysosomal enzyme levels, and their interaction determines the extent of neurodegeneration."

We developed a 3D wide-field second harmonic microscope that employs structured illumination. We image pH induced chemical changes on the curved and confined inner and outer surfaces of a cylindrical glass micro-capillary immersed in aqueous solution. The image contrast reports on the orientational order of interfacial water, induced by charge-dipole interactions between water molecules and surface charges. The images constitute surface potential maps. Spatially resolved surface pKa,s values are determined for the silica deprotonation reaction. Values range from 2.3<pKa,s<10.7, highlighting the importance of surface heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field are also imaged. With this approach, real time movies of surface processes that involve flow, heterogeneities and potentials can be made, which will further developments in electrochemistry, geology, catalysis, biology, and microtechnology."
https://openalex.org/W2738295531,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a loss of intestinal barrier function and dysregulated immune responses. It has been shown that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are protective in IBD and that GPR43 mediates the protective effects of SCFAs. In this study, we investigated the effects of SCFAs in comparison to highly specific GPR43 agonists on human intestinal epithelial and immune cells. Our results confirm that SCFAs are enhancers of barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. Additionally, SCFAs also displayed potent immunoregulatory properties based upon the ability to inhibit LPS-induced cytokine production in PBMC, and human T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to the current belief, specific GPR43 agonists failed to exhibit similar barrier enhancing and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings demonstrate that SCFA possess broad protective functions in IBD and agonizing GPR43 alone is unlikely to be beneficial in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2738868872,"In Australia only 2.2% of published health research has focused on multi-cultural health despite the increase of culturally and linguistically diverse populations. Research on the perceptions and experiences of health care professionals (HCPs) in engaging with refugee and migrant women is also lacking. Given the integral role of HCPs in providing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care for these populations, an understanding of the challenges they experience is required. Therefore, this study sought to examine the perspectives and practices of Australian HCPs with regard to the provision of SRH care for refugee and migrant women.Employing qualitative methods, twenty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with HCPs representing various professions, work experiences, cultural backgrounds, age and healthcare sectors. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and the socio-ecological model was utilised to interpret the data.The complexities of HCP's engagement with refugee and migrant women were identified in three major themes: Being a Migrant; Gender Roles and SRH Decision-making; and Women in the Healthcare System. HCPs discussed the impact of accessing SRH care in women's country of origin and the influence of re-settlement contexts on their SRH knowledge, engagement with care and care provision. Perception of gender roles was integral to SRH decision-making with the need to involve male partners having an impact on the provision of women-centred care. Barriers within the healthcare system included the lack of services to address sexual functioning and relationship issues, as well as lack of resources, time constraints, cost of services, and funding.Australian HCPs interviewed reported that migrant and refugee women do not have appropriate access to SRH care due to multifaceted challenges. These challenges are present across the entire socio-ecological arena, from individual to systemic levels. Multiple and multidimensional interventions are required to increase SRH utilisation and improve outcomes for refugee and migrant women."
https://openalex.org/W2736720042,"Glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is closely associated with protein folding and quality control. We recently described a non-canonical ER quality control mechanism for folding of thrombospondin type 1 repeats by protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2). Epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats are also small cysteine-rich protein motifs that can be O-glycosylated by several ER-localized enzymes, including protein O-glucosyltransferase 1 (POGLUT1) and POFUT1. Both POGLUT1 and POFUT1 modify the Notch receptor on multiple EGF repeats and are essential for full Notch function. The fact that POGLUT1 and POFUT1 can distinguish between folded and unfolded EGF repeats raised the possibility that they participate in a quality control pathway for folding of EGF repeats in proteins such as Notch. Here, we demonstrate that cell-surface expression of endogenous Notch1 in HEK293T cells is dependent on the presence of POGLUT1 and POFUT1 in an additive manner. In vitro unfolding assays reveal that addition of O-glucose or O-fucose stabilizes a single EGF repeat and that addition of both O-glucose and O-fucose enhances stability in an additive manner. Finally, we solved the crystal structure of a single EGF repeat covalently modified by a full O-glucose trisaccharide at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the glycan fills up a surface groove of the EGF with multiple contacts with the protein, providing a chemical basis for the stabilizing effects of the glycans. Taken together, this work suggests that O-fucose and O-glucose glycans cooperatively stabilize individual EGF repeats through intramolecular interactions, thereby regulating Notch trafficking in cells.

Oligosaccharyltransferase modifies newly synthesized proteins as they emerge in the lumen of the ER with N-glycans that are trimmed and recognized by calnexin/calreticulin chaperones, allowing a round of protein folding. Folded proteins move on, and unfolded proteins are recognized and re-glucosylated by the UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) to allow another folding cycle. In addition to this well-known pathway, we recently identified a non-canonical quality control pathway for folding of thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) (3Vasudevan D. Takeuchi H. Johar S.S.

Nonetheless, the effects of eliminating these enzymes in model systems have shown a variety of effects on the trafficking of Notch to the cell surface, which seem to vary with cell type or system. Early studies in flies showed that the Drosophila form of POFUT1 (Ofut1) has chaperone activity that is independent of its fucosyltransferase activity and required for proper cell-surface expression of Notch (28Okajima T. Xu A. Lei L. Irvine K.D. Chaperone activity of protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 promotes notch receptor folding.Science. 2005; 307: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast, Notch receptors, although non-functional, are expressed on the cell surface of mouse embryonic stem cells that lack Pofut1 (29Stahl M. Uemura K. Ge C. Shi S. Tashima Y. Stanley P.

A recent study in flies suggested that POGLUT1 and POFUT1 cooperate in folding and trafficking of the Notch receptor (31Ishio A. Sasamura T. Ayukawa T. Kuroda J. Ishikawa H.O. Aoyama N. Matsumoto K.

This would help to explain some of the variability seen in different systems described above. Here, we examine whether this is the case in mammalian cells. Using CRISPR/CAS9, we generated POGLUT1 and POFUT1 single or double knock-out cells to examine effects on Notch cell-surface expression. In addition, we used in vitro EGF stability assays to evaluate whether addition of O-glucose or O-fucose stabilizes EGF repeats similar to how O-fucose stabilizes TSRs. Finally, we solved the structure of an EGF repeat with a full O-glucose trisaccharide structure to reveal how the glycans interact with the underlying protein to offer a structural basis for the stabilizing effects of the glycan. To examine the effects of loss of O-fucose and O-glucose glycans on Notch1 functions, we genetically deleted POFUT1 or POGLUT1, which are solely responsible for the initial attachment of O-fucose or O-glucose to EGF repeats, respectively, in HEK293T cells. We previously reported that Notch1 is endogenously expressed on the cell surface of HEK293T cells, and that Notch1 produced in HEK293T cells is modified with O-fucose and O-glucose glycans at high stoichiometries at many EGF repeats (Fig. 1A) (13Kakuda S.

Chem. 2011; 286: 31623-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Successful bi-allelic mutations at the expected regions in POFUT1 or POGLUT1 were confirmed by genomic DNA sequencing (supplemental Fig. S1A). As expected, POFUT1 KO cells (clone KB8) or POGLUT1 KO cells (clone OD3) did not show any residual enzymatic POFUT1 or POGLUT1 activities, respectively, in in vitro assay with cell extracts (supplemental Fig. S1B). Flow cytometric analysis showed that the levels of endogenous Notch1 on the cell surface were reduced by a factor of 2 in either POFUT1 or POGLUT1 KO cells compared with the control wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis showed that these single KO cells contained slightly higher levels of full-length Notch1 proteins than that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). Because full-length Notch1 has not been processed by furin in the Golgi, this observation suggests an increased level of Notch1 in the ER in these cells. These results demonstrated that POFUT1 and POGLUT1 are required for efficient Notch1 trafficking from the ER to the cell surface in HEK293T cells. We next generated POFUT1 and POGLUT1 double KO cells using the above POFUT1 single KO cells. We confirmed their genotypes by genomic sequencing (supplemental Fig. S1A) and in vitro enzymatic assays (supplemental Fig. S1B). Double KO cells showed further reduction in the cell-surface expression of Notch1 compared with POFUT1 or POGLUT1 single KO cells (Fig. 1B). Of note, Western blot analysis showed increased full-length Notch1 proteins in the double KO cell lysates compared with the single KO cells (Fig. 1C). These results strongly suggested that both O-fucose and O-glucose glycans are required for proper Notch1 trafficking in HEK293T cells and that they function in a non-redundant, additive manner. To demonstrate that the requirement for POFUT1 and POGLUT1 localizes to the EGF repeats in the extracellular domain of Notch1, we performed cell-based secretion assays with a Notch1 construct encoding EGF(1–36) (N1(1–36)) (Fig. 1D). N1(1–36) was expressed at comparable levels in cell lysates of all cells except the empty vector controls. In wild-type control cells, N1(1–36) was secreted to the culture media. In POFUT1 or POGLUT1 single KO cells, N1(1–36) was not secreted, whereas a control protein without EGF repeats, IgG, was unaffected. In POFUT1 KO cells, co-transfection of POFUT1 rescued this secretion defect, whereas co-transfection of POGLUT1 did not. Likewise, in POGLUT1 KO cells, co-transfection of POGLUT1 rescued the secretion defect, whereas co-transfection of POFUT1 did not. These results support the above notion that addition of O-fucose by POFUT1 and O-glucose by POGLUT1 to the EGF repeats in the Notch1 extracellular domain are both required for efficient protein folding and secretion in HEK293T cells. Our recent studies suggested that POFUT2 is required for secretion of TSR-containing proteins because addition of O-fucose stabilizes the folded TSRs in the ER (3Vasudevan D. Takeuchi H. Johar S.S. Majerus E. Haltiwanger R.S. Peters plus syndrome mutations disrupt a noncanonical ER quality-control mechanism.Curr. Biol. 2015; 25: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether O-fucose and O-glucose perform a similar function on EGF repeats, we adapted the unfolding assay used in the TSR study to measure the effects of the sugars on the stability of EGF repeats. We used the first EGF repeat from human coagulation factor 9 (hFA9) as a model because it contains similar numbers of amino acids as Notch EGF repeats, contains consensus sequences for both O-fucose and O-glucose modifications, and is endogenously modified with these types of O-glycans (32Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. O-Linked fucose and other post-translational modifications unique to EGF modules.Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). As with TSRs, folded and denatured hFA9 EGF can be separated by reverse-phase HPLC, and monitoring UV absorbance allows us to quantitate the amounts of each species (supplemental Fig. S2). Dithiothreitol (DTT) unfolded hFA9 EGF by reducing the disulfide bonds, although it was not unfolded in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) alone (supplemental Fig. S2, A and C). GdnHCl accelerated the rate of unfolding by DTT (supplemental Fig. S2B). We also compared DTT sensitivities of several EGF repeats from hFA9 and mouse Notch1 (33Takeuchi H. Kantharia J. Sethi M.K. Bakker H. Haltiwanger R.S. Site-specific O-glucosylation of the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch: efficiency of glycosylation is affected by proper folding and amino acid sequence of individual EGF repeats.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 33934-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3). These EGF repeats showed differential sensitivities to DTT at a specific time point, suggesting different EGF repeats have distinct stabilities. Nonetheless, these results clearly indicated that this assay can be used to monitor the stability of EGF repeats in the presence of DTT. To examine the effect of O-fucose and O-glucose modifications on the stability of EGF repeats, we modified hFA9 EGF with O-fucose and/or O-glucose glycans by in vitro glycosylation. Successful addition of O-glycans to the EGF repeat was confirmed by mass spectrometry (supplemental Table S1). The resulting glycosylated and unglycosylated EGF repeats were subjected to unfolding assays (Fig. 2A and supplemental Figs. S4 and S5). Addition of O-glucose monosaccharide slowed the unfolding of the EGF repeat compared with that of the unglycosylated EGF repeat. Exogenous free glucose did not show any effect on the unfolding of unglycosylated and Glc-EGF (data not shown), suggesting that the glucose attached covalently to the Ser in the O-glucose consensus stabilizes the folded EGF. We also examined whether elongation of O-glucose by xylose residues affects stability of EGF repeats (Fig. 2A, top row). Interestingly, addition of the first xylose canceled the stabilizing effect of O-glucose monosaccharide (i.e. it destabilized the EGF repeat). Addition of the second xylose stabilized the folding of EGF somewhat compared with Xyl-Glc-EGF. Next, we examined how the addition of O-fucose affected the stability of the hFA9 EGF repeat (Fig. 2A, bottom row). Addition of O-fucose also slowed the unfolding of the EGF repeat compared with that of the unglycosylated hFA9 EGF repeat. Addition of both O-fucose and O-glucose unfolded more slowly than either alone, indicating that O-fucose and O-glucose monosaccharides stabilize single EGF repeats in an additive manner. Addition of xyloses to the O-fucose/O-glucose-modified EGF had similar effects to that seen for the O-glucose alone. hFA9 EGF repeat has a calcium-binding motif (34Handford P.A. Baron M. Mayhew M. Willis A. Beesley T. Brownlee G.G. Campbell I.D. The first EGF-like domain from human factor IX contains a high-affinity calcium binding site.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and binding of a calcium ion stabilizes EGF repeats (35Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. The structure of a Ca2+-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain: its role in protein–protein interactions.Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We confirmed the stabilizing effect of calcium using our unfolding assay (compare Fig. 2B with 2A). We examined whether O-fucose or O-glucose glycans can further stabilize the hFA9 EGF repeat that has been stabilized by calcium. All EGF repeats in the presence of calcium unfolded more slowly than those in the absence of calcium (Fig. 2B compared with 2A). The O-glycan modifications showed similar effects on unfolding of hFA9 EGF repeat in the absence and presence of calcium ions (Fig. 2B compared with 2A). We previously reported that O-glucosylation at EGF28 is required for Delta-like 1-induced Notch1 signaling in NIH3T3 cell-based assays (14Rana N.A. Nita-Lazar A. Takeuchi H. Kakuda S. Luther K.B. Haltiwanger R.S. O-Glucose trisaccharide is present at high but variable stoichiometry at multiple sites on mouse Notch1.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 31623-31637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In vitro enzymatic assays suggested that EGF28 of mouse Notch1 is a poorer substrate for POGLUT1, suggesting the efficiency of modification on EGF28 could vary depending on the levels of POGLUT1 in a particular cell (33Takeuchi H. Kantharia J. Sethi M.K. Bakker H. Haltiwanger R.S. Site-specific O-glucosylation of the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats of Notch: efficiency of glycosylation is affected by proper folding and amino acid sequence of individual EGF repeats.J.

Our mass spectral approach revealed that the vast majority of O-glucose glycans attached to EGF28 of mouse Notch1 from NIH3T3 cells was a monosaccharide species (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S6). These data indicated that the attachment of an O-glucose monosaccharide to mouse Notch1 EGF28 is important for its Delta-like 1-mediated activation. We then examined whether addition of O-glucose glycans to EGF28 of mouse Notch1 changes protein stability. Because EGF28 of mouse Notch1 does not have a calcium-binding motif, we performed a s"
https://openalex.org/W2737052624,"How cell-type-specific physiological properties shape neuronal functions in a circuit remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), a higher olfactory circuit, where neurons belonging to distinct glomeruli in the antennal lobe feed excitation to three types of intrinsic neurons, α/β, α'/β', and γ Kenyon cells (KCs). Two-photon optogenetics and intracellular recording revealed that whereas glomerular inputs add similarly in all KCs, spikes were generated most readily in α'/β' KCs. This cell type was also the most competent in recruiting GABAergic inhibition fed back by anterior paired lateral neuron, which responded to odors either locally within a lobe or globally across all lobes depending on the strength of stimuli. Notably, as predicted from these physiological properties, α'/β' KCs had the highest odor detection speed, sensitivity, and discriminability. This enhanced discrimination required proper GABAergic inhibition. These results link cell-type-specific mechanisms and functions in the MB circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2736984476,"Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan flagellate that is transmitted by tsetse flies into the mammalian bloodstream. The parasite has a huge impact on human health both directly by causing African sleeping sickness and indirectly, by infecting domestic cattle. The biology of trypanosomes involves some highly unusual, nuclear-localised processes. These include polycistronic transcription without classical promoters initiated from regions defined by histone variants, trans-splicing of all transcripts to the exon of a spliced leader RNA, transcription of some very abundant proteins by RNA polymerase I and antigenic variation, a switch in expression of the cell surface protein variants that allows the parasite to resist the immune system of its mammalian host. Here, we provide the nuclear proteome of procyclic Trypanosoma brucei, the stage that resides within the tsetse fly midgut. We have performed quantitative label-free mass spectrometry to score 764 significantly nuclear enriched proteins in comparison to whole cell lysates. A comparison with proteomes of several experimentally characterised nuclear and non-nuclear structures and pathways confirmed the high quality of the dataset: the proteome contains about 80% of all nuclear proteins and less than 2% false positives. Using motif enrichment, we found the amino acid sequence KRxR present in a large number of nuclear proteins. KRxR is a sub-motif of a classical eukaryotic monopartite nuclear localisation signal and could be responsible for nuclear localization of proteins in Kinetoplastida species. As a proof of principle, we have confirmed the nuclear localisation of six proteins with previously unknown localisation by expressing eYFP fusion proteins. While proteome data of several T. brucei organelles have been published, our nuclear proteome closes an important gap in knowledge to study trypanosome biology, in particular nuclear-related processes."
https://openalex.org/W2737260216,"Shifting cultivation is the main land-use system transforming landscapes in riverine Amazonia. Increased concentration of the human population around villages and increasing market integration during the last decades may be causing agricultural intensification. Studies have shown that agricultural intensification, i.e. higher number of swidden-fallow cycles and shorter fallow periods, reduces crop productivity of swiddens and the regrowth capacity of fallows, undermining the resilience of the shifting cultivation system as a whole. We investigated the temporal and spatial dynamics of shifting cultivation in Brazilian Amazonia to test the hypotheses that (i) agriculture has become more intensive over time, and (ii) patterns of land-use intensity are related to land accessibility and human population density. We applied a breakpoint-detection algorithm to Landsat time-series spanning three decades (1984–2015) and retrieved the temporal dynamics of shifting cultivation fields, which go through alternating phases of crop production (swidden) and secondary forest regrowth (fallow). We found that fallow-period length has decreased from 6.4 to 5.1 years on average, and that expansion over old-growth forest has slowed down over time. Shorter fallow periods and higher frequency of slash and burn cycles are practiced closer to residences and around larger villages. Our results indicate that shifting cultivation in riverine Amazonia has gone through a process of agricultural intensification in the past three decades. The resulting landscape is predominantly covered by young secondary forests (≤ 12 yrs old), and 20% of it have gone through intensive use. Reversing this trend and avoiding the negative consequences of agricultural intensification requires land use planning that accounts for the constraints of land use in riverine areas."

We are often faced with situations in which multiple sources of information need to be combined to make good decisions. Multi-sensory integration provides an attractive model system in which to explore the neural mechanisms by which multiple sensory signals are combined to make perceptual decisions (Alais et al., 2010Alais D.

Stanford T.R. Multisensory integration: current issues from the perspective of the single neuron.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), a detailed understanding of the neural computations underlying multisensory integration remains elusive. A diverse array of empirical observations has been usefully characterized as a set of empirical principles of multisensory integration (Meredith and Stein, 1986Meredith M.A. Stein B.E.

Multisensory integration: current issues from the perspective of the single neuron.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). For example, multisensory neurons in cat superior colliculus often show super-additive integration of weak visual and auditory inputs, whereas they show additive or sub-additive summation for stronger inputs; this is known as the principle of inverse effectiveness (Meredith and Stein, 1986Meredith M.A. Stein B.E.

As another example, the spatial/temporal principle holds that multisensory stimuli need to be congruent in space and time for cross-modal enhancement of neural responses to occur; otherwise, cross-modal suppression may occur, a phenomenon in which the multisensory response of a neuron is less than its response to the stronger unisensory input (Kadunce et al., 1997Kadunce D.C.

These empirical principles generally involve non-linear interactions between inputs from different modalities, but experimental evidence that can distinguish among different possible types of nonlinearities has remained very limited. We previously proposed a divisive normalization model of multisensory integration that accounts naturally for many of the key empirical principles of multisensory integration (Ohshiro et al., 2011Ohshiro T. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. A normalization model of multisensory integration.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The model is based on a few well-established neural operations: linear summation of inputs (Ferster, 1994Ferster D.

Thus, normalization may be a canonical neural computation (Carandini and Heeger, 2011Carandini M. Heeger D.J. Normalization as a canonical neural computation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 13: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). We showed previously that a divisive normalization model of multisensory integration makes a critical prediction that can distinguish it from other models: specifically, a non-optimal stimulus for one modality, which activates a neuron when presented alone, should be able to suppress the response to a near-optimal stimulus of the other modality when the cues are combined (Ohshiro et al., 2011Ohshiro T. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. A normalization model of multisensory integration.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here, we provide a direct test of this prediction by recording from multisensory neurons in the dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) area that combine visual and vestibular signals regarding self-motion (Duffy, 1998Duffy C.J. MST neurons respond to optic flow and translational movement.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1816-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, Gu et al., 2006Gu Y. Watkins P.V. Angelaki D.E.

Neurons in area MSTd have been previously linked to perceptual integration of visual and vestibular heading cues (Gu et al., 2008Gu Y. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. Neural correlates of multisensory cue integration in macaque MSTd.Nat.

Here, we show that responses of MSTd neurons fulfill the critical prediction of the normalization model with regard to cross-modal suppression. We also demonstrate that the normalization model, fit simultaneously to data from our entire population of MSTd neurons, accounts better for the data than an alternative model based on subtractive inhibition. If cross-modal suppression is a diagnostic feature of a multisensory stage of normalization, then it should not be seen in relevant unisensory areas. MSTd receives its primary visual input from the adjacent MT area (Born and Bradley, 2005Born R.T. Bradley D.C. Structure and function of visual area MT.Annu. Rev.

Thus, we also probed for the existence of cross-modal suppression in area MT and did not find any evidence for it. Together, our findings provide strong experimental support for the proposal that divisive normalization, operating at the level of multisensory integration, can account for many of the empirical principles of multisensory integration exhibited by single neurons (Ohshiro et al., 2011Ohshiro T. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. A normalization model of multisensory integration.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The divisive normalization model of visual-vestibular cue integration (Figure 1A) assumes that MSTd neurons receive heading-selective vestibular and visual (optic flow) inputs, with heading preferences that may be matched or mismatched to varying degrees (Gu et al., 2006Gu Y. Watkins P.V. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. Visual and nonvisual contributions to three-dimensional heading selectivity in the medial superior temporal area.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Each neuron performs a weighted linear sum of its visual and vestibular inputs, with weights dvest and dvis that are fixed for that neuron. The result is then passed through a power-law non-linearity, after which its output gain is multiplicatively modulated by a function of the pooled spiking activity of other neurons in the population (“feedback normalization”; Heeger, 1992bHeeger D.J. Normalization of cell responses in cat striate cortex.Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 9: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar; see Discussion). Note that the semi-saturation constant in the model (α in Equations 5, 6, and 7) produces responses that rise gradually and saturate as a function of stimulus intensity. Note also that, while this type of normalization model can produce averaging behavior under some circumstances (e.g., Busse et al., 2009Busse L. Wade A.R. Carandini M. Representation of concurrent stimuli by population activity in visual cortex.Neuron. 2009; 64: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it more generally produces a range of possible interactions depending on the relative strengths of the stimuli and input weights. More specifically, simulated responses of a typical model neuron show cross-modal enhancement when both cues are presented together at the visual and vestibular heading preferences of the neuron (Figure 1B, left). However, the same neuron shows a paradoxical cross-modal suppression when one of the two cues (cue2) is presented at a non-preferred heading (Figure 1B, middle): the non-preferred cue2 activates the model neuron when presented alone, but suppresses responses when presented together with the preferred cue1. This diagnostic cross-modal suppression only occurs at large stimulus intensities and only within a narrow heading range for the non-preferred cue. If the heading of cue2 is further from the cell’s heading preference, then this non-optimal input can become suppressive on its own (Figure 1B, right). In such a case, cross-modal suppression is trivially explained by summation of an activating input with a suppressive input. Thus, to test for operation of divisive normalization at the level of multisensory integration, we seek evidence of this narrow regime in which the non-optimal input drives a response on its own but induces cross-modal suppression. To summarize these relationships graphically, we plot the combined response (Rcomb) to both cues against the response to the non-preferred cue (Rcue2), with both values normalized by the response to the preferred cue (Rcue1). In this representation (Figure 1C), values above and below unity on the ordinate indicate cross-modal enhancement and suppression, respectively, and values greater than zero on the abscissa indicate that the non-preferred input activates the unit above baseline response. Thus, the critical prediction of multisensory normalization is that data should fall within the lower-right quadrant for some offsets (Δ) of cue2 from the preferred heading for that modality. Indeed, predicted responses of the model neuron move from the top-right quadrant through the lower-right quadrant as Δ is increased (Figure 1C, circles). Eventually, as Δ is further increased, data points enter the lower-left quadrant, corresponding to the case of trivial cross-modal suppression. Ursino et al., 2009Ursino M. Cuppini C. Magosso E. Serino A. di Pellegrino G. Multisensory integration in the superior colliculus: a neural network model.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2009; 26: 55-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar proposed an alternative model of multi-sensory integration that accounts for the principle of inverse effectiveness and other key properties of multisensory integration in the superior colliculus (Cuppini et al., 2010Cuppini C. Ursino M. Magosso E. Rowland B.A. Stein B.E. An emergent model of multisensory integration in superior colliculus neurons.Front. Integr. Nuerosci. 2010; 4: 6PubMed Google Scholar). This alternative model, which is based on subtractive inhibition, makes a distinct prediction from the normalization model with regard to cross-modal suppression (Ohshiro et al., 2011Ohshiro T. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. A normalization model of multisensory integration.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For the alternative (subtractive) model (Figure 1C, triangles), cross-modal suppression only occurs when the non-preferred cue is suppressive on its own. As a result, the predictions of this class of model do not pass through the lower-right quadrant of Figure 1C. We further demonstrate mathematically that this class of alternative model, in which the multisensory input to each neuron is subtractively modulated by the pooled spiking activity of other neurons, does not predict non-trivial cross-modal suppression under a realistic set of assumptions (see STAR Methods). Therefore, cross-modal suppression by an activating non-preferred input is a diagnostic indicator of multisensory divisive normalization. We sought to demonstrate the diagnostic form of cross-modal suppression by recording from MSTd neurons in macaques that were trained to fixate a visual target while multisensory (visual/vestibular) stimuli were presented using a projector mounted on a motion platform (see STAR Methods for details). We recorded from a total of 165 MSTd neurons in two animals; among these, we obtained sufficient data (at least five repetitions of each stimulus) from a group of 101 neurons (42 from monkey A and 59 from monkey B), which forms the main database for this study. Of the remaining 64 neurons, isolation was lost for 55 neurons before the protocol was completed, and 9 neurons were discarded because they showed no heading selectivity for visual or vestibular cues. Among the 101 MSTd cells studied in detail, 68 were multisensory neurons (26 from monkey A and 42 from monkey B) that showed clear heading selectivity for both visual and vestibular cues, as well as firing rates that increased with stimulus amplitude. We first examine cross-modal suppression in these multisensory neurons. The remaining 33/101 cells (16 from monkey A and 17 from monkey B) were unisensory neurons that responded reliably only to optic flow. These neurons are analyzed separately in a later section. Once an action potential was isolated, we first characterized the 3D heading selectivity of the neuron (Gu et al., 2006Gu Y. Watkins P.V. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. Visual and nonvisual contributions to three-dimensional heading selectivity in the medial superior temporal area.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and determined its heading preferences for each modality (Figure 2A, white crosses). For most multisensory neurons, we used a “search” protocol (Figure 2B) to estimate the range of headings over which a non-preferred input might elicit cross-modal suppression while activating the neuron on its own. The heading for one modality (visual in this example) was offset by 30° steps in elevation from its preferred heading (white dots in Figure 2A) while the heading of the other modality (vestibular) was fixed at the preferred value. As expected, visual responses of this neuron peaked at zero offset (Δ = 0°) and declined with the absolute value of the offset, |Δ| (Figure 2B, red). The combined response (black) was suppressed below the vestibular response (cyan) for |Δ| > 30°. This cross-modal suppression is of the trivial form for |Δ| > 90° because visual responses are below baseline activity (gray) for this range of Δ, suggesting that the visual cue becomes suppressive. Critically, within a narrow range of Δ values around ± 60°, this neuron shows cross-modal suppression along with significant visual activation, consistent with the diagnostic prediction of the divisive normalization model. To quantify these effects in detail, we tested each neuron with a range of stimulus intensities and a substantial number of stimulus repetitions (5–15; median, 8). Stimulus intensity was manipulated by varying the amplitude of self-motion, which followed a Gaussian velocity profile (see STAR Methods; Figure S1). Each neuron was tested with stimuli having Δ = 0°, as well as at least one non-zero Δ value chosen to probe for cross-modal suppression (many cells were tested with multiple non-zero values of Δ; see STAR Methods). For the example neuron, vestibular and visual responses rose monotonically with self-motion amplitude for Δ = 0°, and combined responses exceeded unisensory responses for all amplitudes (Figure 2C, left). Offsetting the visual heading by Δ = +60° (Figure 2C, middle) greatly reduced visual responses, but these responses were still significantly greater than baseline activity for each non-zero motion amplitude (p < 1.8 × 10−4 for each amplitude, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests). Critically, at this offset, the combined response was significantly suppressed below the vestibular response for the two largest stimulus amplitudes (p < 1.8 × 10−4 for amplitudes of 4.4 and 11.8 cm, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests). Very similar observations were made for Δ = −60° (Figure 2C, right). These results demonstrate clearly that a non-optimally presented cue, which activates the neuron when presented alone, can suppress the response to an optimal stimulus of the other modality, as predicted by the divisive normalization model. Data from a few additional example neurons are illustrated in Figure 3. These include another neuron for which a non-preferred visual stimulus suppressed the combined response below the level of the vestibular response (Figure 3A), as well as two additional neurons for which the vestibular stimulus was offset from the preferred heading and caused a suppression of the visual response (Figures 3B and 3C). Note that the example neurons in Figures 3A and 3C had mismatched visual and vestibular heading preferences (“opposite cells”; Gu et al., 2006Gu Y. Watkins P.V. Angelaki D.E. DeAngelis G.C. Visual and nonvisual contributions to three-dimensional heading selectivity in the medial superior temporal area.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For such neurons, a combined stimulus with the preferred heading for each modality has different directions of motion for visual and vestibular cues. These examples illustrate that non-preferred stimuli of either modality can elicit cross-modal suppression while still producing responses on their own. This symmetry of the interaction between vestibular and visual inputs is expected from linear summation of tuned unisensory inputs, combined with multisensory normalization. All 68 multisensory neurons were tested with Δ = 0° and with either the visual or the vestibular stimulus at a non-preferred heading (non-zero Δ), and eight neurons were tested with multiple non-preferred headings. For nine neurons, an additional block of trials was run in which the other sensory modality was set to a non-preferred heading. In total, 86 datasets were collected with preferred headings for both modalities, and 97 datasets were collected with a combination of preferred and non-preferred headings. To summarize our findings and pool data across conditions, we defined cue1 to be the cue that was held fixed at the neuron’s preferred heading and cue2 to be the cue for which heading was varied from preferred to non-preferred directions. To quantify cross-modal suppression, we fit the amplitude-response curves for each neuron with a sigmoidal function (see STAR Methods; Equation 1), and we quantified the strength of activity using the response gain parameter (G). These fits provided an excellent description of the data (e.g., Figures 4A and 4B ), with a median R2 value of 0.97 across the population. We adopt a notation in which G(cue1, cue2) indicates the response gain for a particular combination of cue1 and cue2, while p and n denote whether each cue was preferred or non-preferred. Thus, G(p,p) represents the response gain when both cue1 and cue2 have preferred directions, G(p,n) denotes gain for a preferred cue1 and a non-preferred cue 2, G(p,0) indicates gain for a unisensory preferred cue1 stimulus, and G(0,p) or G(0,n) represent gains for unisensory stimuli with preferred or non-preferred headings for cue 2, respectively. We then computed the ratio of the combined response gain (G(p,p) or G(p,n)) to that of the modality presented at the preferred heading (G(p,0)). This ratio indicates w"

Here we show that VCAM1, a transmembrane protein previously found in quiescent adult NSCs, is expressed by a subpopulation of embryonic RGCs, in a temporal and region-specific manner. Loss of VCAM1 reduced the number of active embryonic RGCs by stimulating their premature neuronal differentiation while preventing quiescence in the slowly dividing RGCs. This in turn diminished the embryonic origin of postnatal NSCs, resulting in loss of adult NSCs and defective V-SVZ regeneration. VCAM1 affects the NSC fate by signaling through its intracellular domain to regulate β-catenin signaling in a context-dependent manner. Our findings provide new insight on how stem cells in the embryo are preserved to meet the need for growth and regeneration."

Cilia are thin rod-like microtubule-based organelles, which are found on most mammalian cell types. Cilia can be classified as either motile or non-motile (more commonly referred to as primary) cilia. Motile cilia function mainly as motor organelles, and primary cilia are mainly sensory organelles (1.Badano J.L. Mitsuma N. Beales P.L. Katsanis N.

An open question is whether primary ciliogenic programs, such as exocyst-related ciliary trafficking, are conserved across organs and species. Here, we build on our previous data on exocyst-dependent renal ciliopathy and extend this to retinal ciliopathy, comparing zebrafish and mice. The vertebrate retina is organized into three distinct laminae: the outer nuclear layer (ONL), 2The abbreviations used are: ONL, outer nuclear layer; E, embryonic day; ERG, electroretinography; hpf, hours post-fertilization; INL, inner nuclear layer; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; P, postnatal; PKD, polycystic kidney disease; OPL, outer plexiform layer; RPE, retina pigmented epithelium; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TGN, trans-Golgi network; dpf, days post-fertilized; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)- propane-1,3-diol; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PNA, peanut agglutinin. 2The abbreviations used are: ONL, outer nuclear layer; E, embryonic day; ERG, electroretinography; hpf, hours post-fertilization; INL, inner nuclear layer; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; P, postnatal; PKD, polycystic kidney disease; OPL, outer plexiform layer; RPE, retina pigmented epithelium; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; TGN, trans-Golgi network; dpf, days post-fertilized; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)- propane-1,3-diol; ANOVA, analysis of variance; PNA, peanut agglutinin. the inner nuclear layer (INL), and the ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor cells in the ONL have a specialized morphology consisting of an inner and outer segment that is linked by a connecting cilium and are highly polarized and light-sensitive cells. The inner segment, where protein synthesis occurs, is connected by the cilium to the outer segment, which consists of a microtubule-based axoneme and membrane disc stacks containing opsin required for phototransduction (11.Besharse J.C.

Zebrafish are vertebrates, and zebrafish eyes are well laminated structures that are functionally very similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, including humans. Eye morphogenesis in the zebrafish starts at 11.5 h post-fertilization (hpf), and the eyecup is well-formed by 24 hpf. By 48 hpf, most of the retina is subdivided into its characteristic sublaminae (14.Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E. Early retinal development in the zebrafish, Danio rerio: light and electron microscopic analyses.J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 515-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The connecting cilia and basal body in the inner segment are observed at 50 hpf, and the outer segment is visible by 54 hpf. The first visual responses can be elicited around 70 hpf, and photoreceptor cells reach adult size by 576 hpf (24 days) (14.Schmitt E.A. Dowling J.E.

In mice, eye development begins at embryonic day 8 (E8), and evidence of retinal development is seen at E13.5. At about the same time, E13, rod photoreceptor cells can be observed, with the peak production of rod photoreceptors occurring at postnatal day 1 (P1). In contrast, cone photoreceptors are all generated between E12 and E18. At birth, these newly formed photoreceptor precursors occupy the distal half of the retina forming a mantle of poorly differentiated cells. By P10, the differentiating photoreceptors have migrated into the ONL, after which they start their final process of maturation, the growth of the outer segment, and the establishment of functional synapses within the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Formation of the OPL, a layer of synapses between dendrites of bipolar and horizontal cells from the inner nuclear layer, and photoreceptor terminal axons from the ONL, is complete by P14 (16.Graw J. Eye development.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2010; 90: 343-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). All cells in the retina are ciliated; however, here we paid particular attention to photoreceptor cells. In photoreceptor cells, vesicles containing proteins that are destined for the outer segment traffic from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the base of the connecting cilium via vesicular transport (17.Deretic D.

One of the central proteins implicated in vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the cilium in photoreceptors is the small GTPase, Rab8 (20.Nachury M.V. Loktev A.V. Zhang Q. Westlake C.J. Peränen J.

We previously demonstrated that the exocyst is required for ciliogenesis in canine renal tubule cells, due to its role in targeting and docking vesicles carrying ciliary proteins (21.Zuo X. Guo W.

We also showed that Cdc42, another small GTPase, localizes the exocyst to the primary cilium and biochemically and genetically interacts with exocyst complex member Exoc5 (also known as Sec10) (22.Zuo X.

Chem. 2011; 286: 22469-22477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found in zebrafish, using antisense morpholinos, that knockdown of exoc5 resulted in small eyes (23.Fogelgren B. Lin S.Y. Zuo X. Jaffe K.M. Park K.M. Reichert R.J. Bell P.D.

Chacon-Heszele M.F. Huang L. McKenna S. Wilson F.P. Zuo X. Lipschutz J.H. Cdc42 deficiency causes ciliary abnormalities and cystic kidneys.J. Am. Soc.

Kim S.H. Dunaief J.L. Lipschutz J.H. Cdc42 and sec10 are required for normal retinal development in zebrafish.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2015; 56: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the role of exoc5 in eye development using mutant exoc5 zebrafish, photoreceptor-specific Exoc5 mouse knockouts, histology, immunohistology, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These data show that there exists a conserved ciliogenic program across species and organs. We previously showed that antisense morpholino knockdown of exoc5 (also known as sec10) in zebrafish is associated with ciliary defects, including upward tail curvature and cardiac malformations as well as smaller eyes and increased cell death in the retina, the latter suggesting that exoc5 plays a critical role in retinal cell development and maintenance (23.Fogelgren B. Lin S.Y. Zuo X. Jaffe K.M. Park K.M. Reichert R.J. Bell P.D. Burdine R.D. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst protein Sec10 interacts with polycystin-2 and knockdown causes PKD-phenotypes.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1001361Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given the concerns about off-target effects of morpholinos in experiments designed to further characterize the physiologic role of exoc5 in retinal cell development and homeostasis, we utilized an exoc5 mutant zebrafish line from the Zebrafish International Resource Consortium (ZIRC), exoc5 sa23168. By sequencing of the mutants, we first confirmed that a single point mutation (CGA→TGA) at codon 377 led to a premature stop codon (Fig. 1, A and B), which previously had been shown to result in a truncated (at amino acid 376) and non-functional Exoc5 protein. By light microscopy, we observed that the gross phenotype of exoc5 mutants was similar to other zebrafish mutants or morphants with defects in cilia formation and function (26.Bizet A.A. Becker-Heck A. Ryan R. Weber K. Filhol E. Krug P. Halbritter J. Delous M. Lasbennes M.C. Linghu B. Oakeley E.J. Zarhrate M. Nitschké P. Garfa-Traore M.

A mutation in VPS15 (PIK3R4) causes a ciliopathy and affects IFT20 release from the cis-Golgi.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13586Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At 3.5 dpf, all exoc5 mutants had an upward tail curvature, smaller eyes, pericardial edema, and hydrocephalus (Fig. 1, D and F), when compared with wild-type (WT) siblings (Fig. 1, C and E). The morphologic phenotype was consistently observed in ∼25% of the progeny from crosses of heterozygous parents as would be expected for Mendelian inheritance of a recessive mutation, with exoc5 mutants surviving to at least 4 dpf. By Western blot analysis, we confirmed that Exoc5 protein was undetectable in exoc5 mutant larvae, when compared with their WT siblings (Fig. 1G). The exocyst is thought to act as a holocomplex, and we previously showed that knockdown of Exoc5 in MDCK cells resulted in the disruption of the exocyst and loss of other exocyst complex members, most likely by degradation in the proteasome, as the exocyst complex disintegrates in the absence of Exoc5 (21.Zuo X. Guo W. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst protein Sec10 is necessary for primary ciliogenesis and cystogenesis in vitro.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 2522-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To confirm this observation in vivo, we probed for Exoc4 protein expression in the exoc5 mutants. Wild-type 3.5 dpf larvae showed strong expression of Exoc4 protein. In contrast, knockout of exoc5 resulted in significantly depleted levels of Exoc4 protein (Fig. 1G). Interestingly, knockout of exoc5 resulted in an increase in Mob1 phosphorylation (pMOB1), consistent with activation of the Hippo pathway (Fig. 1, G and H), a pathway known to be involved in restraining organ growth (28.Badouel C. Garg A. McNeill H. Herding Hippos: regulating growth in flies and man.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 837-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29.Happé H. van der Wal A.M. Leonhard W.N. Kunnen S.J. Breuning M.H. de Heer E. Peters D.J. Altered Hippo signalling in polycystic kidney disease.J. Pathol. 2011; 224: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To confirm that the ciliary defects observed in exoc5 mutants were caused specifically by loss of exoc5, we performed rescue experiments by injecting wild-type human EXOC5 mRNA into control and exoc5 mutant embryos at the 1–2-cell stage. At 3.5 dpf, we found that low dose (100 pg) reconstitution of EXOC5 mRNA, in exoc5 mutant embryos, partially rescues the heart and eye phenotype, whereas high dose (250 pg) EXOC5 mRNA fully rescues the exoc5 mutant phenotype (Fig. 1I). To ensure that the loss of exoc5 was causing the phenotype, another exoc5 mutant, using CRISPR gene editing, was generated, and the resulting phenotype was observed to be virtually identical to the exoc5 mutant phenotype described above, as well as to our previously described exoc5 morphants (supplemental Fig. 1) (23.Fogelgren B. Lin S.Y. Zuo X. Jaffe K.M. Park K.M. Reichert R.J. Bell P.D. Burdine R.D. Lipschutz J.H. The exocyst protein Sec10 interacts with polycystin-2 and knockdown causes PKD-phenotypes.PLoS Genet. 2011; 7: e1001361Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These data show that loss of functional Exoc5 protein in zebrafish leads to gross pathology indicative of ciliopathy in the heart, brain, and eye. Histologic analysis was completed to examine retinal morphology in exoc5 mutant zebrafish larvae at 3.5 dpf. In transverse sections, all exoc5 mutants exhibited smaller eyes and abnormal retinal lamination (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, the photoreceptor/ONL layer in exoc5 mutants was incompletely formed and severely disorganized (Fig. 2, A and B). Disorganization and lack of photoreceptor outer segments was more obvious by TEM of exoc5 mutant larvae at 3.5 dpf. In WT siblings, cone photoreceptor outer segments extended toward the retina pigmented epithelium (RPE) in a parallel and organized manner and exhibited well-stacked discs in the outer segments (indicated by white arrows in Fig. 2C). In contrast, the cone outer segments in exoc5 mutants were significantly fewer in number, shorter in length, and disorganized (Fig. 2D). Such abnormalities were never observed in retinal sections of WT siblings. Taken together, these results indicate that eye development, proper retinal lamination, and outer segment morphogenesis requires exoc5 function. We next used immunohistochemistry to determine whether localization and trafficking of photoreceptor outer segment proteins occurred normally in exoc5 mutants. At 3.5 dpf, rhodopsin localized normally to the rod outer segments of WT fish (Fig. 3A). In exoc5 mutants, rudimentary outer segment localization of rhodopsin was observed, together with some rhodopsin being mislocalized to the inner segments (Fig. 3B). To quantify the lengths of the outer segments, we used rhodopsin immunoreactivity as a surrogate, determining the extent of rhodopsin staining along the proximal–distal axis of the outer segments. In WT siblings, outer segments were 7.9 ± 0.45 μm in length (n = 20 embryos, 130 outer segments), whereas exoc5 mutant outer segment were 3.2 ± 0.23 μm in length (60.5% shorter, p < 0.001; n = 12 embryos, 60 outer segments) (Fig. 3G). To determine whether these shortened outer segments correlated with cilia formation, we labeled retina sections with antibodies against acetylated α-tubulin, a marker that is required and sufficient to determine the presence of photoreceptor cilia (30.Liu Q. Zuo J. Pierce E.A. The retinitis pigmentosa 1 protein is a photoreceptor microtubule-associated protein.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6427-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although retina sections in WT zebrafish showed the presence of cilia, we could not detect cilia in the retina sections of exoc5 mutants (Fig. 3, C and D). We next examined cone morphology, the predominant photoreceptor cell type in the zebrafish retina, by immunolabeling with peanut agglutinin lectin (PNA-488), which labels the interphotoreceptor matrix surrounding cone outer segments and, to some extent, the retinal plexiform layers (31.Gargini C. Terzibasi E. Mazzoni F. Strettoi E. Retinal organization in the retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mutant mouse: a morphological and ERG study.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 222-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Peanut agglutinin lectin staining revealed that the exoc5 mutant cone outer segments were significantly shorter (5.8 ± 0.33 μm in WT versus 2.2 ± 0.24 μm in mutants; p < 0.001), disorganized, and misshapen (Fig. 3, E, F, and H). Additionally, the number of cone outer segments was significantly fewer in number in exoc5 mutants compared with WT siblings (Fig. 3, E and F), which suggested that loss of exoc5 results in defective cone outer segment morphogenesis. These data demonstrate that exoc5 is indispensable for cilia and subsequent photoreceptor outer segment formation in zebrafish. Photoreceptor-specific knockout of Exoc5 in mice was accomplished by crossing the Exoc5 fl/fl mouse line, which we made using embryonic stem (ES) cells from the European conditional mouse mutagenesis (EUCOMM) consortium (clone number DEPD00521_3) (32.Fogelgren B. Polgar N. Lui V.H. Lee A.J. Tamashiro K.K. Napoli J.A. Walton C.B. Zuo X. Lipschutz J.H. Urothelial defects from targeted inactivation of exocyst Sec10 in mice cause ureteropelvic junction obstructions.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0129346Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), with a rhodopsin-Cre driver line. The conditional target mouse line, designated as Exoc5fl/fl;Rho-Cre+, was confirmed by PCR-based genotyping (supplemental Fig. 2). Histologic analyses in frozen sections of retinas from WT and Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ mice revealed severe thinning of the outer retina in postnatal day 30 (P30) mice (Fig. 4B), when compared with WT animals (Fig. 4A). Disorganization and lack of photoreceptor outer segments were more obvious by transmission electron microscopy of conditional Exoc5 knock-out animals. In WT siblings at P30, photoreceptor outer segments extended toward the RPE in a parallel and organized manner, giving a palisade pattern (Fig. 5, A and C). In contrast, the photoreceptor outer segments in Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ mice were significantly fewer in number, shorter in length, and disorganized (Fig. 5, B and D). We further examined the structure of the photoreceptor sensory cilium components in WT and Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ retinas. The stacks of nascent discs were organized and were oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the axoneme that extended from the basal body and transition zone in WT mice (Fig. 5E). In contrast, we did not observe connecting cilia components in Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ retinas (Fig. 5F). Taken together, these results indicate that outer segment morphogenesis requires Exoc5 function, and Exoc5 is necessary for photoreceptor ciliogenesis in mice.Figure 5Ultrastructural analysis of wild-type and conditional Exoc5 knock-out mouse photoreceptors. Transmission electron microscopy provided ultrastructural views of wild-type (WT) and Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ mice photoreceptor cells.

In contrast, Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ mouse retinas exhibited significantly decreased levels of rhodopsin, and the rhodopsin was not specifically localized to the outer segments (Fig. 6B). Indeed, in Exoc5 fl/flRho-Cre+ mice, rhodopsin was aberrantly distributed to the inner portion of the ONL (cell bodies), as well to the inner segments of photoreceptors, indicating a defect in cilia trafficking (Fig. 6B). As we did for zebrafish retinas, rhodopsin immunoreactivity along the axis of the outer segment was used to document a shortened outer segment length in mutant mice (Fig. 6G). Photoreceptor degeneration, as indicated by a thinning of the ONL, was observed in retinas from Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ mice by P30, a time at which the ONL was only ∼2–3 cells thick (Fig. 6, A–F). To determine whether this ONL cell loss correlated with an absence of cilia, we labeled retinal sections with antibodies against acetylated α-tubulin. Although many cilia were detected in retinal sections in WT animals throughout the ONL, no cilia were seen in the retinal sections of Exoc5 fl/fl;Rho-Cre+ mice at P30 (Fig. 6, C and D).

https://openalex.org/W2738852905,"The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) TYRO3, AXL and MERTK (TAM) have well-described oncogenic functions in a number of cancers. Notwithstanding, TAM RTKs are also potent and indispensable inhibitors of inflammation. The combined deletion of Axl and Mertk in mice enhances chronic inflammation and autoimmunity, including increased inflammation in the gut and colitis-associated cancer. On the other hand, deletion of Tyro3 increases the risk of allergic responses. Therefore, the indiscriminate inhibition of these TAM RTKs could result in undesirable immunological diseases. Here we show that AXL, but not MERTK or TYRO3 expression is enhanced in late stage colorectal cancer (CRC) and AXL expression associates with a cell migration gene signature. Silencing AXL or the inhibition of AXL kinase activity significantly inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion. These results indicate that the selective inhibition of AXL alone might confer sufficient therapeutic benefit in CRC, while preserving at least some of the beneficial, anti-inflammatory effects of MERTK and TYRO3 RTKs."

In contrast, we have recently shown that expression of erythropoietin in a GnTI knock-out, FUT8-overexpressing cell line results in the production of fully core-fucosylated glycoforms of the oligomannose substrate Man5GlcNAc2, suggesting that FUT8 can catalyze core fucosylation of N-glycans lacking an α1,3-arm GlcNAc in cells. Here, we revisited the substrate specificity of FUT8 by examining its in vitro activity toward an array of selected N-glycans, glycopeptides, and glycoproteins. Consistent with previous studies, we found that free N-glycans lacking an unmasked α1,3-arm GlcNAc moiety are not FUT8 substrates. However, Man5GlcNAc2 glycan could be efficiently core-fucosylated by FUT8 in an appropriate protein/peptide context, such as with the erythropoietin protein, a V3 polypeptide derived from HIV-1 gp120, or a simple 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate-protected Asn moiety.

Recently, Wang and co-workers (19.Calderon A.D. Liu Y. Li X. Wang X. Chen X. Li L. Wang P.G. Substrate specificity of FUT8 and chemoenzymatic synthesis of core-fucosylated asymmetric N-glycans.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2016; 14: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) performed a comprehensive analysis using a library of 77 N-glycans, and the study demonstrated that FUT8 strictly requires the presence of a free GlcNAc moiety to the α1,3-arm in the N-glycan for the fucose transfer, whereas the requirement for the 1,6-arm is relaxed. Nevertheless, in contrast to those in vitro analysis, several previous reports have implicated a GnTI-independent fucosylation pathway in mammalian cells. Haltiwanger and co-workers (20.Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S.

Later, Crispin et al. (21.Crispin M. Harvey D.J. Chang V.T. Yu C. Aricescu A.R. Jones E.Y. Davis S.J. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M.

Recently, our group has reported that expression of several glycoproteins, including ectodomain of FcγIIIa receptor, GM-CSF, and erythropoietin (EPO), in a GnTI knock-out HEK293T cell line in suspension culture produced a significant amount (3–50%) of the corresponding core-fucosylated Man5GlcNAc2 (M5) glycoforms (6.Yang Q.

Chem. 2016; 291: 11064-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the FUT8 gene in this cell line led to full core fucosylation of EPO-M5, whereas knockdown of this gene resulted in production of EPO glycoforms without core fucosylation, confirming that FUT8 is the sole enzyme responsible for core fucosylation (6.Yang Q. Wang L.X. Mammalian α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) is the sole enzyme responsible for the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-independent core fucosylation of high-mannose N-glycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 11064-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The apparently contradictory in vitro and in vivo results prompted us to revisit the substrate specificity of FUT8. We noticed that the acceptors used in those in vitro assays were either free glycans (with or without simple derivatization) or very small glycopeptide (produced from glycoproteins by intensive Pronase treatment). In contrast, all of the core fucosylations of oligomannose glycan detected in vivo are from glycoproteins. This led us to hypothesize that in addition to the N-glycan part, the peptide portion of certain glycoprotein (such as EPO) may also interact with FUT8 to facilitate the catalysis of core fucosylation of the N-glycans that otherwise have only low activity toward FUT8 (Fig. 1B). To test this hypothesis, we examined different substrates, including the Man5GlcNAc2 glycoforms of EPO and ribonuclease B (EPO-M5 and Rb-M5), HIV-1 V3 glycopeptides carrying a Man5GlcNAc2 or a complex type N-glycan (V3-M5 and V3-CT), free M5, and Fmoc-labeled Man5GlcNAc2-Asn (M5-Asn-Fmoc). We found that FUT8 could efficiently core-fucosylate the M5 in the context of EPO and the HIV-1 V3 polypeptide, without the need of an α1,3-arm GlcNAc moiety. FUT8 was also found to fucosylate the Man5GlcNAc2-Asn-Fmoc and even the complex type N-glycan in the context of the V3 peptide, albeit at relatively low efficiency. To test our hypothesis that the peptide portion of EPO may enhance the fucosylation by FUT8, we performed the in vitro reaction with EPO-M5, following the procedures described by Wang and co-workers (Fig. 2) (19.Calderon A.D. Liu Y. Li X. Wang X. Chen X. Li L. Wang P.G. Substrate specificity of FUT8 and chemoenzymatic synthesis of core-fucosylated asymmetric N-glycans.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2016; 14: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a human FUT8 (Thermo Fisher). We prepared the EPO-M5 by α1,2-mannosidase treatment of the high-mannose glycoform of EPO that is produced from the HEK293T cell line. As shown in Fig. 3A, LC-MS analysis of EPO-M5, the starting material, displayed a major peak of 23,008 Da (calculated mass = 23,011 Da), with a minor peak of 23,153 (addition of one fucose) that is derived from in vivo core fucosylation. After a 5-h reaction (Fig. 3B), three new major species emerged, with a molecular mass of 23,153, 23,300, and 23,447 Da, respectively (deconvolution data). The difference between the three species was 146 Da (a fucose moiety, suggesting the addition of 1–3 fucose moieties to the EPO glycoforms). The most abundant species corresponded to the addition of three fucose moieties to the Man5GlcNAc2-EPO (measured 23,447 Da, calculated mass = 23,449 Da). An extended incubation (24 h) of the reaction mixture with FUT8 (at a low concentration of 0.05 mg/ml), without replenishing any enzyme or GDP-fucose, converted the intermediates into this fully fucosylated glycoform of EPO (estimated 90%). (Fig. 3C). This result provided direct evidence that FUT8 was able to core-fucosylate Man5GlcNAc2 glycan in vitro in the context of EPO, lacking an unmodified GlcNAc moiety at the α1,3-arm. This experiment also confirms our previous in vivo experimental observation that FUT8 is the sole enzyme responsible for core fucosylation of high-mannose N-glycans of glycoproteins. To confirm that fucose is specifically transferred to M5 glycan, the whole glycan was released from the transferred product and analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. 3D, the major N-glycan (>90% in relative intensity), with a molecular mass of 1403.6 Da, matches well with the expected molecular mass of Man5GlcNAc2Fuc (M5F; calculated molecular mass = 1403.4 Da).Figure 3Mass spectrometry analysis of FUT8-catalyzed fucosylation of EPO-M5.

The Rb-M5 was prepared by trimming of the commercially available bovine ribonuclease B (mixtures of Man5–9GlcNAc2 glycoforms) with α1,2-mannosidase to give the pure Man5GlcNAc2-RNase glycoform (found, 14,898 Da, calculated mass = 14,899 Da) (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, incubation of Rb-M5 with FUT8 (0.05 mg/ml) under the same conditions as for EPO-M5, resulted in almost no core fucosylation of the Rb-M5 (Fig. 4B), which was in sharp contrast to that of EPO-M5. This result suggests that an appropriate protein context is important to facilitate in vitro core fucosylation by FUT8. We have shown previously that different glycoproteins gave different levels of core fucosylation in 293GnTI−/−cells. Whereas expression of EPO-M5 resulted in >50% core fucosylation, expression of the FcγIIIa receptor gave only 3% of the core-fucosylated glycoforms (6.Yang Q. Wang L.X. Mammalian α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) is the sole enzyme responsible for the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-independent core fucosylation of high-mannose N-glycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 11064-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We next tested an HIV-1 V3 glycopeptide (33 amino acid residues) carrying a glycan (V3-M5) and also simple Man5GlcNAc2 derivatives. The results are summarized in Table 1. We observed significant core fucosylation of glycopeptide V3-M5 by FUT8 (0.05 mg/ml), giving ∼30 and 50% core fucosylation within a 5- and 24-h incubation, respectively (Fig. 4D). On the other hand, we also found that an Fmoc-modified Man5GlcNAc2 glycan, M5-Asn-Fmoc, could also serve as a substrate of FUT8, albeit with lower reactivity than the V3-M5. 24-h incubation of M5-Asn-Fmoc (Fig. 4E) with FUT8 led to the formation of ∼30% of the fucosylated product (Fig. 4F). In comparison, we confirmed that the free N-glycan Man5GlcNAc2 was not a substrate of FUT8, because incubation of Man5GlcNAc2 with FUT8 under the same conditions as for M5-Asn-Fmoc and M5-V3 did not give a detectable fucosylated product (Fig. 4H). This result is consistent with previous reports.TABLE 1The structures of various substrates/products and the estimated efficiency of FUT8-catalyzed core fucosylationa Calculated on the basis of HPLC quantification of the released N-glycans after tagging with Fmoc.b Calculated by HPLC monitoring and quantification.c 2-h incubation.

To compare the contribution of the α1,3-arm GlcNAc for core fucosylation, we synthesized the corresponding α1,3-arm GlcNAc derivatives by GnTI-catalyzed transfer of a GlcNAc moiety to V3-M5, M5-Asn-Fmoc, and M5, respectively, and tested their reactivity to FUT8. We found that all of the α1,3-arm GlcNAc modified derivatives were excellent substrates of FUT8. Under the same enzymatic reaction conditions as above, 100% core fucosylation of the α1,3-arm GlcNAc modified derivatives were achieved within a 2-h incubation (Fig. 5 and Table 1). This result verified the previous conclusion that N-glycans with an unmodified GlcNAc attached to the α1,3 mannose arm are preferred substrates for FUT8. A previous study showed that FUT8 was unable to transfer fucose to complex type N-glycan in which the α1,3-arm GlcNAc was capped by a galactose or was chemically modified (15.Voynow J.A. Kaiser R.S. Scanlin T.F. Glick M.C.

Substrate specificity of FUT8 and chemoenzymatic synthesis of core-fucosylated asymmetric N-glycans.Org. Biomol. Chem. 2016; 14: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our study, we tested whether FUT8 could transfer fucose to Gal2GlcNA2Man3GlcNAc2 (CT) in the context of the V3 peptide (Fig. 6). We found that incubation of V3-CT with FUT8 (0.05 mg/ml) for 5 days did result in core fucosylation, giving the core-fucosylated V3 glycopeptide, albeit at a slow transformation (∼30% conversion). A new species at m/z 5482.3, an addition of 146 Da to the starting V3-CT, appeared in LC-MS analysis, suggesting an addition of a fucose moiety to the V3-CT (Fig. 7, A and B). To verify that the fucose was attached to the innermost GlcNAc moiety of the N-glycan, we performed Endo-F3 and PNGase F treatment of the reaction product. Endo-F3 specifically cleaves core-fucosylated N-glycans between the two GlcNAc moieties, whereas PNGase F removes the whole N-glycan from the glycopeptide by hydrolyzing the glycosylamide linkage. As illustrated in Fig. 7C, treatment of the product with Endo-F3 revealed a new peak of 4261.9 Da in LC-MS analysis, which corresponds to V3 peptide plus a GlcNAc and a fucose moiety. The V3-CT peak remained intact. This result indicated that the fucose was attached specifically at the innermost GlcNAc of the glycopeptide. Treatment of the product with PNGase F showed a single peak of 3913.8 Da, matching well the V3 peptide backbone where the Asn is converted to Asp after removal of the whole N-glycan (Fig. 7D). This result indicated that the fucose is specifically transferred to the N-glycan, not the peptide portion. Taken together, the data clearly confirmed that fucose was specifically transferred to the innermost GlcNAc of the complex type V3 glycopeptide by the FUT8.Figure 7LC-MS analysis of in vitro fucosylation of V3-CT.

When no GlcNAc was added to the α1,3-mannose arm, no transfer of fucose was detected, suggesting a requirement of a free GlcNAc moiety on the α1,3-mannose arm for FUT8-catalyzed fucosylation.

All of these studies have reached the same conclusion that FUT8 is unable to perform in vitro core fucosylation of N-glycans lacking the α1,3-arm GlcNAc or the N-glycans in which the α1,3-arm GlcNAc is masked or modified. These in vitro studies appeared to be contradictory to the detection of core-fucosylated high-mannose type glycoforms in GnTI knock-out CHO cell lines (20.Lin A.I. Philipsberg G.A. Haltiwanger R.S.

More recently, we have shown that FUT8 is the sole enzyme responsible for the full core fucosylation of the Man5GlcNAc2 glycoform of EPO in a GnTI knock-out and FUT8-overexpressing HEK293T cell line (6.Yang Q. Wang L.X. Mammalian α1,6-fucosyltransferase (FUT8) is the sole enzyme responsible for the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I-independent core fucosylation of high-mannose N-glycans.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 11064-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The apparently contradictory results from the previous in vitro and in vivo studies prompted us to test a hypothesis that in addition to the α1,3-arm GlcNAc moiety, the protein context of the substrate could also play a role in promoting FUT8-catalyzed core fucosylation. Indeed, except for the first report in 1968, all of the in vitro characterization of FUT8 used either free glycans, glycans with simple labeling, or glycans linked to very short peptides. We notice that all in vivo core fucosylation occurred in the context of proteins. In the present study, we provided the first examples indicating that FUT8 was able to core-fucosylate Man5GlcNAc2 glycan in vitro when it was placed in the context of an appropriate protein, such as the EPO, a peptide, such as the V3 domain peptide, and even an Fmoc-tagged Asn moiety. We also found that the glycosylation efficiency was dependent on the context, with the EPO protein being the most effective to promote the FUT-catalyzed fucosylation. Interestingly, we also found that the FUT8 could also fucosylate a full-length complex type N-glycan in the context of the V3 peptide, although at a much lower efficiency compared with the Man5GlcNAc2-V3 glycopeptide. These results suggest that in addition to an α1,3-arm GlcNAc moiety in the glycan, FUT8 could also interact favorably with a suitable peptide portion, as in the case of EPO, or maybe even a simple hydrophobic motif, as exemplified by the Fmoc-tagged M5, to promote the fucosylation. More studies, including detailed structural analysis of enzyme FUT8 or of FUT8 in complex with selected acceptor substrates, as well as testing of additional, specifically modified N-glycan substrates, should be performed to further characterize the nature of the enzyme–substrate interactions for enhanced catalytic efficiency. EPO-M5 was produced by trimming EPO with high mannose glycan (EPO-HM) with α1,2-mannosidase from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (22.Zhu Y. Suits M.D. Thompson A.J. Chavan S. Dinev Z. Dumon C. Smith N.

In the experiments, 100 μg of the EPO-HM or ribonuclease B was mixed with 0.5 μg of α1,2-mannosidase in 10 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.6, containing 5 mm of calcium chloride and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The biotinylated V3-M5 glycopeptide with one M5 glycan on position Asn-332 was synthesized as reported (24.Amin M.N. McLellan J.S. Huang W. Orwenyo J. Burton D.R. Koff W.C. Kwong P.D. Wang L.X.

The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight to reach completion. All substrate was dialyzed to MES buffer, pH 7. All reactions were carried out on a 10-μl scale at 37 °C. For glycoprotein substrate EPO-M5 or Rb-M5, ∼0.6 nmol of substrate was mixed with 1 mm GDP-fucose (Carbosynth USA, San Diego, CA) and 0.05 μg/μl human FUT8 enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the presence of 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 7. For other substrates (V3-M5, M5-Asn-Fmoc, M5, V3-GnM5, GnM5-AsnF-Fmoc, GnM5, and V3-CT), 3 nmol of material was used. The reaction was monitored by LC-MS analysis of reaction fractions collected at certain time points. To characterize the processes, each enzymatic reaction was analyzed by an ExactivePlus Orbitrap LC-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The evaluation of protein reactions was performed with an XbridgeTM BEH300 C4 column (3.5 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm, Waters), under a 6-min linear gradient of 5–90% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. For glycans, Fmoc-Asn-glycans, and glycopeptide, assessments were carried out by an XbridgeTM C18 column (3.5 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm; Waters) under the same gradient and flow rate as for the C4 column. To confirm that fucose was specifically transferred to M5 glycan on EPO, glycan was released from EPO-M5 fucosylation product by PNGase F. Purified glycans were then analyzed by a Bruker UltrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer in positive reflector mode. 100 mg/ml 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) matrix was prepared in a 1:1 H2O/ACN solution, with an additional 20 μl of N,N-dimethylaniline (Sigma-Aldrich) (28.Snovida S.I.

https://openalex.org/W2736331890,"Introduction The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is increasing and several studies suggested an involvement of DNA methylation in the development of these metabolic diseases. This study was designed to investigate if differential DNA methylation in blood can function as a biomarker for T2D and/or MetS. Methods Pyrosequencing analyses were performed for the candidate genes KCNJ11, PPARγ, PDK4, KCNQ1, SCD1, PDX1, FTO and PEG3 in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) from 25 patients diagnosed with only T2D, 9 patients diagnosed with T2D and MetS and 11 control subjects without any metabolic disorders. Results No significant differences in gene-specific methylation between patients and controls were observed, although a trend towards significance was observed for PEG3. Differential methylation was observed between the groups in 4 out of the 42 single CpG loci located in the promoters regions of the genes FTO, KCNJ11, PPARγ and PDK4. A trend towards a positive correlation was observed for PEG3 methylation with HDL cholesterol levels. Discussion Altered levels of DNA methylation in PBLs of specific loci might serve as a biomarker for T2D or MetS, although further investigation is required."

We evaluated, for the first time in an Afro-Caribbean population, the distribution of APOE polymorphisms and their associations with coronary artery disease (CAD), the lipid profile and other cardio-metabolic risk factors.We studied 712 Afro-Caribbean subjects including 220 with documented CAD and 492 healthy subjects. TaqMan assays were performed to genotype rs7412 and rs429358, the two variants that determine the APOE alleles ε2, ε3 and ε4. The association between APOE genotype and the lipid profile was analysed by comparing ε2 carriers, ε3 homozygotes and ε4 carriers.The frequencies of ε2, ε3 and ε4 in the overall sample were 8%, 70% and 22%, respectively. CAD was not associated with APOE polymorphism. The total cholesterol level was higher in ε4 carriers compared with ε2 carriers: 5.07 vs 4.59 mmol/L (P = 0.016). The LDL-cholesterol level was lower in APOE ε2 carriers compared with ε3 homozygotes and ε4 carriers: 2.65 vs 3.03 and 3.17 mmol/L, respectively (p = 0.002). The total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios were similar in the three allelic groups. APOE polymorphism was not associated with diabetes, hypertension, waist circumference or body mass index.Our results indicate that APOE gene polymorphism is associated with the lipid profile but not with CAD in Afro-Caribbean people. This lack of association with CAD may be explained by the low atherogenic profile observed in ε4 carriers, which may warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2738914183,"New Caledonia is a biodiversity hotspot, with an extremely high number of endemic species with narrow distribution ranges that are at high risk of extinction due to open-cast nickel mining, invasive species and seasonal man-induced fires. Mentions of micro-endemism permeate the literature on the biota of this archipelago. However, so far there has been no research comparing distribution range in different animal groups. The aim of this study is to examine the implication of different sampling effort variables in order to distinguish micro-endemicity from data deficiency, and evaluate the distribution range, frequency, and extent to which micro-endemism is common to several groups of organisms. We compiled a dataset derived from publications in Zoologia Neocaledonica, comprising 1,149 species, of which 86% are endemic to New Caledonia. We found that the sampling effort variables that were best correlated with distribution range were the number of sampling dates and the number of collectors per species. The median value of sampling dates was used to establish a cut-off point for defining adequately sampled species. We showed that, although only 52% of species were sampled adequately enough to determine their distribution range, the number of species with a very narrow distribution range was still high. Among endemics from New Caledonia, 12% (116 species) have ranges ≤5.2km2 and 3.9% (38 species) have ranges between 23 and 100 km2. Surprisingly, a similar trend was observed in non-endemic species: 22% occurred in areas ≤ 5.2 km2, and 8% in areas 23–100 km2, suggesting that environmental dissimilarity may play an important role in the distribution of these species. Micro-endemic species were predominant in 18 out of 20 orders. These results will contribute to a re-assessment of the IUCN red list of species in this archipelago, indicating that at least 116 species are probably critically endangered."
https://openalex.org/W2737715241,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether the tumor infiltrative growth pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was associated with blood inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein; CRP and Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio; NLR) and survival in patients with high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods The cohort for this retrospective study included 81 patients with a mean age of 63 years. The tumor depth was superficial or deep in 15 and 66 patients, respectively. The mean CRP and NLR were 1.31 mg/dL and 2.81, respectively. The assessment of a peripheral growth pattern which divided into three patterns on MRI was based on the largest midsection of the tumor. Results On MRI scans, diffuse-type, focal-type, and pushing-type growth patterns were observed in 18, 33, and 30 patients, respectively. Superficial high-grade STS were prone to show a focal-type pattern on MRI. There were no correlations between growth pattern type and clinicopathological factors such as age, sex, tumor size, and histological grade. However, the incidence of infiltrative growth was significantly higher in patients with elevated CRP (p = 0.0002). In multivariate analysis, growth pattern and CRP were independent prognostic factors for disease-specific survival, metastasis-free survival. Growth pattern was also related to local tumor control. Conclusions There were significant associations between the tumor growth pattern and CRP levels in patients with high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma. An infiltrative growth pattern and elevated CRP may be associated with inferior disease-specific and metastasis-free survival rates in these patients. Therefore, careful post-treatment follow-up should be conducted in such patients."
https://openalex.org/W2737887181,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) experienced by pregnant and post-partum women has negative health effects for women, as well as the foetus, and the new-born child. In this study we sought to assess the prevalence and factors associated with recent IPV amongst post-partum women in one clinic in eThekwini Municipality, South Africa, and explore the relationship between IPV, depression and functional limitations/disabilities. Past 12 month IPV-victimisation was 10.55%. Logistic regression modelled relationships between IPV, functional limitations, depressive symptoms, socio-economic measures, and sexual relationship power. In logistic regression models, overall severity of functional limitations were not associated with IPV-victimisation when treated as a continuous overall score. In this model relationship power (aOR0.22, p = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (aOR1.26, p = 0.001) were significant. When the different functional limitations were separated out in a second model, significant factors were relationship power (aOR0.20, p = 0.001), depressive symptoms (aOR1.20, p = 0.011) and mobility limitations (aOR2.96, p = 0.024). The study emphasises that not all functional limitations are associated with IPV-experience, that depression and disability while overlapping can also be considered different drivers of vulnerability, and that women’s experience of IPV is not dependent on pregnancy specific factors, but rather wider social factors that all women experience."
https://openalex.org/W2737888225,"Background A phase 1 trial of a clade B HIV vaccine in HIV-uninfected adults evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA prime co-expressing GM-CSF (Dg) followed by different numbers and intervals of modified vaccinia Ankara Boosts (M). Both vaccines produce virus-like particles presenting membrane-bound Env. Methods Four US sites randomized 48 participants to receiving 1/10th the DNA dose as DgDgMMM given at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 months, or full dose DgDgM_M or DgDgMM_M regimens, given at 0, 2, 4, and 8 months, and 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 months, respectively. Peak immunogenicity was measured 2 weeks post-last vaccination. Results All regimens were well tolerated and safe. Full dose DgDgM_M and DgDgMM_M regimens generated Env-specific IgG to HIV-1 Env in >90%, IgG3 in >80%, and IgA in <20% of participants. Responses to gp140 and gp41 targets were more common and of higher magnitude than to gp120 and V1V2. The gp41 antibody included reactivity to the conserved immunodominant region with specificities known to mediate virus capture and phagocytosis and did not cross-react with a panel of intestinal flora antigens. The 3rd dose of MVA increased the avidity of elicited antibody (7.5% to 39%), the ADCC response to Bal gp120 (14% to 64%), and the one-year durability of the IgG3 responses to gp41 by 4-fold (13% vs. 3.5% retention of peak response). The co-expressed GM-CSF did not enhance responses over those in trials testing this vaccine without GM-CSF. Conclusion This DNA/MVA prime-boost regimen induced durable, functional humoral responses that included ADCC, high antibody avidity, and Env IgG1 and IgG3 binding responses to the immunodominant region of gp41. The third, spaced MVA boost improved the overall quality of the antibody response. These products without co-expressed GM-CSF but combined with protein boosts will be considered for efficacy evaluation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01571960"
https://openalex.org/W2738458187,"Background Whether cigarette smoking and moderate drinking are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)has not been fully described. This study investigated the separate and joint effects of smoking and moderate drinking on Chinese men with NAFLD. Methods Across-sectional assay from DFTJ Cohort study was performed with a size of 9432 elderly Chinese men excluding excessive alcohol consumption (<210g/week). Fatty liver was diagnosed by standardized ultrasonographic inspection. The odds ratio (OR) of alcohol consumption and smoking for the prevalence of NAFLD were analyzed using multiple logistic regression with multiple adjustments. Results The prevalence of NAFLD in current smokers (pack-year≥40) and drinkers (80~210g/week or drinking duration≥35years) was significantly higher than that in non-smokers and non-drinkers, respectively. The combination of current smoking (pack-year≥40) and drinking (80~210g/week) was associated with the highest risk of NAFLD (OR 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–2.68;P<0.01). The similar combined effect was found in participants with pack-year≥40 and drinking duration≥35 years (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.26–2.34;P<0.01). Moreover, an interaction was observed between current smoking and moderate drinking in NAFLD. Conclusions In elderly Chinese men, cigarette smoking and moderate alcohol consumption exerts an evident joint effect and interaction on the prevalence of NAFLD, although both are significantly and independently associated with NAFLD prevalence. Such findings highlight particular significance of avoidance of cigarette and alcohol on NAFLD prevention."

We employ frames that emphasize national security, human rights, and environmental importance about the consequences of climate change. We find no evidence that issue frames have an overall effect on opinions about the importance of climate change policy. We do find some evidence that the effect of issue frames varies across ideological and partisan groups. Most notably, issue frames can lead Republicans and those on the political right to view climate change policy as less important. We conclude by discussing our findings relative to extant literature and considering the implications of our findings for those who seek to address the issue of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2738629404,"Bartonellae are phylogenetically diverse, intracellular bacteria commonly found in mammals. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats have a high prevalence and diversity of Bartonella infections globally. Isolates (n = 42) were obtained from five bat species in four provinces of Thailand and analyzed using sequences of the citrate synthase gene (gltA). Sequences clustered into seven distinct genogroups; four of these genogroups displayed similarity with Bartonella spp. sequences from other bats in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Thirty of the isolates representing these seven genogroups were further characterized by sequencing four additional loci (ftsZ, nuoG, rpoB, and ITS) to clarify their evolutionary relationships with other Bartonella species and to assess patterns of diversity among strains. Among the seven genogroups, there were differences in the number of sequence variants, ranging from 1–5, and the amount of nucleotide divergence, ranging from 0.035–3.9%. Overall, these seven genogroups meet the criteria for distinction as novel Bartonella species, with sequence divergence among genogroups ranging from 6.4–15.8%. Evidence of intra- and intercontinental phylogenetic relationships and instances of homologous recombination among Bartonella genogroups in related bat species were found in Thai bats."
https://openalex.org/W2739266994,"Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) translocate hydrophilic nucleosides across cellular membranes and are essential for salvage nucleotide synthesis and purinergic signaling. Unlike the prototypic human ENT members hENT1 and hENT2, which mediate plasma membrane nucleoside transport at pH 7.4, hENT3 is an acidic pH-activated lysosomal transporter partially localized to mitochondria. Recent studies demonstrate that hENT3 is indispensable for lysosomal homeostasis, and that mutations in hENT3 can result in a spectrum of lysosomal storage-like disorders. However, despite hENT3's prominent role in lysosome pathophysiology, the molecular basis of hENT3-mediated transport is unknown. Therefore, we sought to examine the mechanistic basis of acidic pH-driven hENT3 nucleoside transport with site-directed mutagenesis, homology modeling, and [3H]adenosine flux measurements in mutant RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes. Scanning mutagenesis of putative residues responsible for pH-dependent transport via hENT3 revealed that the ionization states of Asp-219 and Glu-447, and not His, strongly determined the pH-dependent transport permissible-impermissible states of the transporter. Except for substitution with certain isosteric and polar residues, substitution of either Asp-219 or Glu-447 with any other residues resulted in robust activity that was pH-independent. Dual substitution of Asp-219 and Glu-447 to Ala sustained pH-independent activity over a broad range of physiological pH (pH 5.5–7.4), which also maintained stringent substrate selectivity toward endogenous nucleosides and clinically used nucleoside drugs. Our results suggest a putative pH-sensing role for Asp-219 and Glu-447 in hENT3 and that the size, ionization state, or electronegative polarity at these positions is crucial for obligate acidic pH-dependent activity.

However, the precise mechanism of disease pathogeneses and possible treatment interventions for these disorders is not understood largely due to a lack of information on the hENT3 structural and functional characteristics. We undertook this project to determine the mechanistic basis of acidic pH-dependent activity of hENT3 to better understand the subcellular transport characteristics of nucleosides. Here, we report the ionization states of Asp-219 and Glu-447 in hENT3 to determine the pH-dependent transport permissible-impermissible conformational states of the transporter by acting as pH sensors of the transport microenvironment. Transportability of hENT1 and -2 is generally tested at the physiological blood pH (pH 7.4), which is representative of the pH at the cell surface and within the interstitium. However, secondary localization in intracellular organelles is reported for many hENTs including hENT1 and hENT2, where the pH could vary significantly from pH 7.4 (10.Baldwin S.A. Yao S.Y. Hyde R.J.

To test the functionality of hENTs in a wide range of physiologically relevant pH values, [3H]adenosine transport levels of hENT cRNA injected Xenopus oocytes were analyzed using extracellular solutions buffered between pH 4.5 and 8.5 (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the total flux of tritiated [3H]adenosine of hENT1- or hENT2-injected oocytes was robust even at a low pH. In fact, transport was not significantly different throughout the entire pH range tested (pH 4.5 to pH 8.5) (Fig. 1A). To investigate transport of hENT3, we utilized the Δ36hENT3 construct in which the N-terminal 36 amino acids of hENT3 are deleted to enable cell-surface localization of an otherwise intracellular transporter (10.Baldwin S.A.

Conversely to the results with hENT1 and hENT2, the [3H]adenosine transport maxima of Δ36hENT3 was seen at pH 5.5 and was reduced drastically in transport solutions with pH values >6.5 (Fig. 1A). The transport maximum for hENT4 was observed at pH 5.5–6.5 as reported earlier (Fig. 1A) (18.Barnes K. Dobrzynski H. Foppolo S. Beal P.R. Ismat F. Scullion E.R. Sun L. Tellez J. Ritzel M.W.

Res. 2006; 99: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The maximal flux of adenosine in oocytes varied significantly among hENTs, which is likely due to differences in affinities of hENTs to adenosine (Km effect) and their expression levels on the oocyte cell surface (Vmax effect) (Fig. 1A). To relate to the pH-dependent activities of hENTs, we utilized an R-value (defined as the ratio of the transport flux at pH 7.4 to that of at pH 5.5) as reported earlier for an Escherichia coli acidic pH-dependent arginine-agmatine antiporter (33.Wang S. Yan R. Zhang X. Chu Q. Shi Y. Molecular mechanism of pH-dependent substrate transport by an arginine-agmatine antiporter.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111: 12734-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). If the R value is close to 1, the transporter is completely pH independent, and if the R value is close to 0 the transporter is completely pH-dependent. The estimated R values (in parenthesis) for hENTs demonstrated a rank order of hENT3 (0.07) > hENT4 (0.63) > hENT2 (1.02) > hENT1 (1.02). This indicates that hENT3 is the strongest pH-dependent member of the family followed by hENT4, and hENT1 and hENT2 are pH-independent members (Fig. 1B). Similar to hENT3, the mouse ortholog, mENT3, is also an acidic pH-driven transporter (10.Baldwin S.A. Yao S.Y. Hyde R.J. Ng A.M. Foppolo S. Barnes K. Ritzel M.W. Cass C.E. Young J.D.

However, the fungal ortholog of ENT3, Fun26, which localizes to acidic vacuoles analogous to lysosomes in mammals, was reported to be a pH-independent transporter (34.Boswell-Casteel R.C.

These findings suggested a possible functional divergence of the pH-dependent transport activity within the mammalian ENT families. In search of the amino acid changes responsible for this divergence, we performed sequence identity and similarity comparisons among the human, mouse, and rat ENT family members using Clustal Omega and constructed a phylogenetic tree using Genebee Services (Fig. 1C). These analyses showed hENT4 has the highest sequence identity (20.175) and similarity (165) with hENT3, the only other pH-sensitive member of the family (supplemental Fig. S1). The analysis also suggested that the amino acids conferring pH dependence would be conserved in more similar members (hENT3 and hENT4) than in distant (hENT1 an"

We have previously reported the presence of choroidal γδ T cells in a model of chronic degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The goals of the current study were to further define the functions of choroidal γδ T cells and to explore the underlying mechanisms of their action. Our data demonstrate that choroidal γδ T cells are activated by RPE injury in response to NaIO3 treatment, and that they express genes that encode immunosuppressive cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10. γδ-T-cell–deficient mice developed profound RPE and retinal damage at doses that caused minimal effects in wild-type mice, and adoptive transfer of γδ Tcells prevented sensitization. Intravitreal injection of IL-4 and IL-10 ameliorated RPE toxicity that was induced by NaIO3. Ex vivo coculture of γδ T cells with RPE explants activated the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines via an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent mechanism. AhR deficiency abolished the protective effects of γδ Tcells after adoptive transfer. Collectively, these findings define important roles for choroid γδ T cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis in the outer retina.—Zhao, Z., Liang, Y., Liu, Y., Xu, P., Flamme-Wiese, M.

https://openalex.org/W2738905132,"The stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-mediated DNA-sensing pathway plays an important role in the innate immune response to pathogen infection, autoimmunity, and cancer; however, its regulatory mechanism has not been fully elucidated, and we do not yet know whether the STING pathway is counter-regulated by other innate immune pathways. Here, we show that the NLRP3-activating agonists, ATP and nigericin, prevent STING pathway activation in association with mitochondrial fragmentation; however, the suppression of the STING pathway and mitochondria fission were not dependent on NLRP3 or potassium efflux. Although nigericin-induced mitochondria fission was rescued by knockdown of either dynamin-related protein 1 or TBC1 domain family member 15 (TBC1D15), which are two distinct mitochondria fission regulators, only TBC1D15 restored the activity of the STING pathway, which indicates that inflammasome-activating signals curtail STING pathway activation via TBC1D15. Finally, we found that deficiency of mitofusin (MFN) 1, a mediator of mitochondrial fusion, inhibited STING pathway activation, which leads to a decrease in the induction of IFN-β and its inducible gene, ISG56, in conjunction with diminished activation of the signaling molecules, TANK-binding kinase 1 and IFN regulatory factor 3, that are downstream of STING. These results highlight the crucial role of MFN1 in maintaining the competency of the STING pathway. Collectively, our findings reveal that mitochondrial dynamics regulators modulate the activation of the STING signaling pathway.—Kwon, D., Park, E., Kang, S.-J.

https://openalex.org/W2736828995,"The very effective anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) is known to have cardiotoxic side effects, which could be accompanied by autonomic modulation. Autonomic disbalance might even be an initiating mechanism underlying DOX-induced cardiotoxicity and can be studied noninvasively by the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). A number of strategies have been assessed to predict chemotherapy-induced cardiac dysfunction while HRV, a potential detecting tool, has not yet been tested. Thus, we aimed to determine the effect of DOX treatment on HRV in a rat model of colorectal cancer. While pretreatment with fullerenol (Frl) acts protectively on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, we aimed to test the effect of Frl pretreatment on DOX-induced HRV alterations. After the induction of colorectal cancer, adult male Wistar rats were treated with saline (n = 7), DOX (1.5 mg/kg per week, n = 7) or DOX after pretreatment with Frl (25 mg/kg per week, n = 7) for three weeks (cumulative DOX dose 4.5 mg/kg). One week after treatment rats were anaesthetized, standard ECG was measured and HRV was analyzed in time and frequency domain. During autopsy the intestines and hearts were gathered for biochemical analysis and histopathological examination. DOX treatment significantly decreased parasympathetically mediated high-frequency component (p<0.05) and increased the low-frequency component of HRV (p<0.05), resulting in an increased LF/HF ratio (p<0.05) in cancerous rats. When pretreated with Frl, DOX-induced HRV alterations were prevented: the high-frequency component of HRV increased (p<0.01), the low-frequency decreased (p<0.01), LF/HF ratio decreased consequently (p<0.01) compared to DOX only treatment. In all DOX-treated animals, disbalance of oxidative status in heart tissue and early myocardial lesions were found and were significantly reduced in rats receiving Frl pretreatment. Autonomic modulation accompanied the development of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rat model of colorectal cancer and was prevented by Frl pretreatment. Our results demonstrated the positive prognostic power of HRV for the early detection of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2738911449,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is often associated with activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase, Flt3, including internal tandem duplications (ITDs) within the regulatory juxtamembrane region. Previous studies have linked Flt3-ITD to the activation of the Fes protein tyrosine kinase in AML, and RNAi-knockdown studies suggest that Fes may be required for Flt3 function. In this study, we tested Fes inhibitors from three different chemical classes for their growth-suppressive activity against Flt3-ITD+ myeloid leukemia cell lines (MV4-11, MOLM-13 and MOLM-14) vs. myeloid cells with wild-type Flt3 (THP-1). All Fes inhibitors selectively inhibited the growth of Flt3-ITD+ AML cells, with IC50 values for diaminopyrimidine and pyrrolopyridine inhibitors ranging from 19 to 166 nM. In contrast, a pyrazolopyrimidine inhibitor was less potent in Flt3-ITD+ AML cells, with IC50 values in the 1.0 μM range. In vitro kinase assays showed that the most potent inhibitors of Flt3-ITD+ AML cell proliferation blocked both Fes and Flt3-ITD kinase activity, while the pyrazolopyrimidine was more selective for Fes vs. Flt3-ITD. All three inhibitors induced significant apoptosis in Flt3-ITD+ AML cells, with potency equivalent to or greater than the established Flt3-ITD inhibitor, tandutinib. Transformation of TF-1 cells with Flt3-ITD resulted in constitutive activation of endogenous Fes, and rendered the cells highly sensitive to all three Fes inhibitors with IC50 values in the 30–500 nM range. The pyrrolopyridine compound also induced apoptotic responses in patient-derived Flt3-ITD+ AML bone marrow cells but not in normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that Fes kinase activity contributes to Flt3-ITD signaling in AML, and suggests that dual inhibition of both Flt3 and Fes may provide a therapeutic advantage for the treatment of Flt3-ITD+ AML."
https://openalex.org/W2736434028,"It is conceivable that contemporary valvular heart disease (VHD) is affected largely by an age-dependent atherosclerotic process, which is similar to that observed in coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a comorbid condition of VHD and CAD has not been precisely examined. The first objective of this study was to examine a possible comorbid condition. Provided that there is no comorbidity, the second objective was to search for the possible reasons by using conventional risk factors and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) because BNP has a potentiality to suppress atherosclerotic development.The study population consisted of 3,457 patients consecutively admitted to our institution. The possible comorbid condition of VHD and CAD and the factors that influence the comorbidity were examined by covariance structure analysis and multivariate analysis.The distribution of the patients with VHD and those with CAD in the histograms showed that the incidence of VHD and the severity of CAD rose with seniority in appearance. The real statistical analysis was planned by covariance structure analysis. The current path model revealed that aging was associated with VHD and CAD severity (P < 0.001 for each); however, as a notable result, there was an inverse association regarding the comorbid condition between VHD and CAD (Correlation coefficient [β]: -0.121, P < 0.001). As the second objective, to clarify the factors leading to this inverse association, the contribution of conventional risk factors, such as age, gender, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, obesity and dyslipidemia, to VHD and CAD were examined by multivariate analysis. However, these factors did not exert an opposing effect on VHD and CAD, and the inverse association defied explanation. Since different pathological mechanisms may contribute to the formation of VHD and CAD, a differentially proposed path model using plasma BNP revealed that an increase in plasma BNP being drawn by VHD suppressed the progression of CAD (β: -0.465, P < 0.001).The incidence of VHD and CAD showed a significant conflicting relationship. This result supported the likely presence of unknown diverse mechanisms on top of the common cascade of atherosclerosis. Among them, the continuous elevation of plasma BNP due to VHD might be one of the explicable factors suppressing the progression of CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2737513288,"Ginseng, Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, is one of the most important medicinal plants for human health and medicine. It has been documented that over 80% of genes conferring resistance to bacteria, viruses, fungi and nematodes are contributed by the nucleotide binding site (NBS)-encoding gene family. Therefore, identification and characterization of NBS genes expressed in ginseng are paramount to its genetic improvement and breeding. However, little is known about the NBS-encoding genes in ginseng. Here we report genome-wide identification and systems analysis of the NBS genes actively expressed in ginseng (PgNBS genes). Four hundred twelve PgNBS gene transcripts, derived from 284 gene models, were identified from the transcriptomes of 14 ginseng tissues. These genes were classified into eight types, including TNL, TN, CNL, CN, NL, N, RPW8-NL and RPW8-N. Seven conserved motifs were identified in both the Toll/interleukine-1 receptor (TIR) and coiled-coil (CC) typed genes whereas six were identified in the RPW8 typed genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the PgNBS gene family is an ancient family, with a vast majority of its genes originated before ginseng originated. In spite of their belonging to a family, the PgNBS genes have functionally dramatically differentiated and been categorized into numerous functional categories. The expressions of the across tissues, different aged roots and the roots of different genotypes. However, they are coordinating in expression, forming a single co-expression network. These results provide a deeper understanding of the origin, evolution and functional differentiation and expression dynamics of the NBS-encoding gene family in plants in general and in ginseng particularly, and a NBS gene toolkit useful for isolation and characterization of disease resistance genes and for enhanced disease resistance breeding in ginseng and related species."

Results Median FLT3-L expression increased from MGUS (58.77 pg/ml in bone marrow; 80.40 pg/ml in peripheral blood) to NDMM (63.15 pg/ml in bone marrow; 85.05 pg/ml in peripheral blood) and was maximal in RRMM (122 pg/ml in bone marrow; 160.47 pg/ml in peripheral blood; NDMM vs. RRMM p<0.001). A cut-off value of FLT3-L >92 pg/ml in bone marrow and >121 pg/ml in peripheral blood was associated with relapse or refractoriness in MM patients. FLT3-L was found to be a high predictive marker for discrimination between NDMM and RRMM as well in bone marrow as in peripheral blood (AUC 0.75 in bone marrow; vs 0.84 in peripheral blood). Conclusion High levels of FLT3-L in bone marrow and peripheral blood of MM patients identify patients with progressive disease and are associated with relapse or refractoriness in MM patients. FLT3-L could be useful as a marker to identify RRMM patients and should be evaluated as target for future therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2737928423,"To cope with environmental stresses, bacteria have evolved various strategies, including the general stress response (GSR). GSR is governed by an alternative transcriptional σ factor named σS (RpoS) that associates with RNA polymerase and controls the expression of numerous genes. Previously, we have reported that posttranslational regulation of σS in the aquatic bacterium Shewanella oneidensis involves the CrsR-CrsA partner-switching regulatory system, but the exact mechanism by which CrsR and CrsA control σS activity is not completely unveiled. Here, using a translational gene fusion, we show that CrsR sequesters and protects σS during the exponential growth phase and thus enables rapid gene activation by σS as soon as the cells enter early stationary phase. We further demonstrate by an in vitro approach that this protection is mediated by the anti-σ domain of CrsR. Structure-based alignments of CsrR orthologs and other anti-σ factors identified a CsrR-specific region characteristic of a new family of anti-σ factors. We found that CrsR is conserved in many aquatic proteobacteria, and most of the time it is associated with CrsA. In conclusion, our results suggest that CsrR-mediated protection of σS during exponential growth enables rapid adaptation of S. oneidensis to changing and stressful growth conditions, and this ability is probably widespread among aquatic proteobacteria.

To cope with environmental changes or stresses, bacteria develop various strategies, and among them, the general stress response (GSR) 3The abbreviations used are: GSR, general stress response; CrsA-P, phosphorylated CrsA; TMAO, trimethylamine oxide; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; GHKL, gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase, and MutL. 3The abbreviations used are: GSR, general stress response; CrsA-P, phosphorylated CrsA; TMAO, trimethylamine oxide; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; GHKL, gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase, and MutL. is essential for survival. GSR is governed by an alternative transcriptional σ factor named σS (RpoS) that associates with the RNA polymerase and thus controls the expression of numerous genes; for example, its regulon contains more than 500 genes in Escherichia coli. As a consequence, σS availability is tightly regulated at transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational levels, leading to an increase of σS in response to stresses or signals like, for instance, starvation and pH modifications and conversely to a decrease of this σ factor under favorable conditions (1.Hengge R.

Microbiol. 2011; 65: 189-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the posttranslational regulation of σS is driven by the ClpXP machinery in concert with the adaptor protein RssB. During exponential phase, RssB binds to σS and addresses it to the protease complex (3.Hengge R. Proteolysis of σS (RpoS) and the general stress response in Escherichia coli.Res. Microbiol. 2009; 160: 667-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To counteract the role of RssB when σS is required, the anti-adaptor proteins IraD, IraM, and IraP interact with RssB and prevent the degradation of σS (4.Battesti A. Hoskins J.R. Tong S. Milanesio P. Mann J.M. Kravats A. Tsegaye Y.M. Bougdour A. Wickner S. Gottesman S. Anti-adaptors provide multiple modes for regulation of the RssB adaptor protein.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 2722-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The posttranslational regulation of σB controlling the GSR has been extensively studied in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. σB is posttranslationally regulated by the RsbWV partner-switching mechanism. RsbW is an anti-σ factor that sequesters σB and phosphorylates RsbV when bacteria are under favorable conditions, and RsbV is an anti-σ factor antagonist that binds RsbW and frees σB under stressful conditions (5.Dufour A. Haldenwang W.G. Interactions between a Bacillus subtilis anti-σ factor (RsbW) and its antagonist (RsbV).J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1813-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6.Price C.W.

American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Press, Washington, D. C.2011: 301-318Google Scholar). In the latter case, dephosphorylation of RsbV is triggered by specific phosphatases (RsbU and RsbP). In a recent study, we have shown that in Shewanella oneidensis, a Gram-negative bacterium, σS posttranslational regulation is also controlled by a partner-switching mechanism involving CrsR and CrsA (see Fig. 1) (7.Bouillet S. Genest O. Jourlin-Castelli C. Fons M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. The general stress response σS is regulated by a partner switch in the Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26151-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CrsR is a three-domain response regulator comprising a receiver domain (D1), a phosphatase domain (D2), and a kinase/anti-σ factor domain (D3), and CrsA is an anti-σ factor antagonist. In the absence of signal, σS is sequestered because it is bound to the anti-σ factor domain D3 of CrsR that phosphorylates the anti-σ factor antagonist CrsA (CrsA-P). When a stress arises, the phosphatase activity of CsrRD2 dephosphorylates CrsA-P; CrsA can thus bind to the third domain of CrsR (CrsRD3) and liberates σS, which can in turn interact with the RNA polymerase to allow the adaptation of bacteria to their environment. CrsR belongs to the GHKL ATPase/kinase superfamily that comprises proteins with little primary sequence homology aside from the conserved Bergerat motif (N, G1, and G2 boxes) and similar structural fold (8.Dutta R. Inouye M. GHKL, an emergent ATPase/kinase superfamily.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Among its members, bacterial anti-σ factor proteins or domains such as SpoIIAB, CrsRD3, and RsbW constitute a subfamily of kinases that presents the conserved Bergerat ATP-binding site and a defined region of dimerization (9.Campbell E.A. Masuda S. Sun J.L. Muzzin O. Olson C.A. Wang S. Darst S.A.

Moreover, the anti-σ factor can be a protein per se (RsbW and SpoIIAB in B. subtilis) or a domain of a more complex protein (the first domain of SypE in Vibrio fisheri or the third domain of CrsR in S. oneidensis and HsbR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa) (7.Bouillet S.

In our previous study, we have unveiled the posttranslational regulation of S. oneidensis σS by detailing the successive steps of the CrsR-CrsA partner-switching mechanism. Here, we show that this mechanism allows a rapid bacterial adaptation in versatile environments by protecting σS from proteolysis, and thus σS remains available when necessary. In addition, we reveal that CrsRD3 belongs to a new family of anti-σ factor domains widespread in aquatic proteobacteria. The question we posed is: what happens to σS when S. oneidensis is under favorable conditions? In a previous work, we have clearly identified the protein CrsR as a σS anti-σ factor. Indeed, it was shown that CrsR is bound to σS when the bacterium is in a favorable environment, whereas under stressful conditions CrsR frees RpoS and binds the anti-σ factor antagonist CrsA (Fig. 1). σS can thus act as a transcriptional regulator for its regulon. σS activity can be followed in vivo by using the dps-lacZ fusion as shown previously (7.Bouillet S. Genest O. Jourlin-Castelli C. Fons M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. The general stress response σS is regulated by a partner switch in the Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26151-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). During exponential growth, the transcription level of the dps-lacZ fusion is at a basal level, whereas at stationary phase it increases drastically (Fig. 2). Moreover, we had observed that during exponential growth the level of transcription of the fusion was lower in the absence of CrsR (strain ΔcrsR harboring dps-lacZ fusion) than in its presence (strain WT harboring dps-lacZ fusion). Thus, we wondered whether σS could be protected by CrsR during the exponential growth of the bacterium to be quickly available in case a stress signal arises. To answer this question, an in vivo experiment measuring σS activity was performed. To this end, a dps-lacZ chromosomal fusion, previously shown to be σS-dependent (Ref. 7.Bouillet S. Genest O. Jourlin-Castelli C. Fons M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. The general stress response σS is regulated by a partner switch in the Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26151-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A), was introduced in a crsR-deleted strain (Fig. 2). As a control, the mutated strain was complemented by a chromosomal insertion of the wild-type copy of crsR. As expected, during exponential growth, a basal level of β-galactosidase activity was measured in the three strains with that of the crsR-deleted strain as low as that of the rpoS mutant. At early stationary phase (10 h), the activity increased strongly under the control of σS in the wild-type and complemented strains, whereas in the ΔcrsR strain a significant increase of β-galactosidase activity was observed only at late stationary phase (Fig. 2A) with it reaching a plateau of lower value (Fig. 2A). This result indicates that, in the absence of CrsR, σS activity is delayed. In contrast, in the presence of CrsR, the adaptation of the bacteria is probably faster because the σS-dependent regulation is more rapidly effective. Moreover, when the crsR deletion was complemented, no time shift was detected, and induction levels were similar to that of the wild-type strain. It is noteworthy that the growth of the three strains was similar and that the delay in the activity was thus not correlated to the growth stage of the bacteria (Fig. 2B). This result is in support of a protective role of CrsR toward σS (Fig. 2A), and we therefore wanted to look at the level of σS in the presence or absence of CrsR. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect σS by Western blotting in the wild-type strain during exponential phase. We thus decided to overproduce σS. For this purpose, σS was produced from a plasmid introduced in wild-type S. oneidensis (MR1), ΔcrsR, and ΔcrsA strains. The crude extracts of the three exponentially grown strains were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of σS was revealed by Western blotting. A band corresponding to σS was observed for each strain, but the amounts of σS are much higher for the wild-type and ΔcrsA strains than that obtained in the absence of CrsR (Fig. 3A). To confirm these results, we then tested the stability of σS by an in vitro approach. Purified σS was incubated with the crude extract of strain MR1 carrying either the control vector (ptac) or the pCrsR plasmid allowing the overproduction of CrsR, and σS stability was followed as a function of time by Western blotting. We found that after 2 h of incubation, the band corresponding to σS almost disappeared when σS was incubated with the control crude extract, whereas the intensity of the band was less reduced when σS was incubated with the extract overproducing CrsR (Fig. 3B). Because in E. coli σS degradation depends on the Clp machinery, we tested whether in S. oneidensis the Clp proteases are also involved in σS stability. Purified σS was incubated with the crude extract of MR1 or ΔclpP strains, and stability of σS was followed as above (Fig. 3C). It appears that under these conditions there are no differences in the pattern of degradation in the presence or absence of the ClpP protease. This suggests that another protease is involved in S. oneidensis σS proteolysis. Altogether, these experiments confirm that CrsR protects σS against degradation (Fig. 3). To determine whether the novel regulation of σS we found in S. oneidensis could be conserved in other bacteria, we searched for CrsR-like proteins in bacterial genomes. This bioinformatics analysis revealed more than 600 CrsR homologs, all sharing the same domain organization (i.e. a receiver, a phosphatase domain, and a kinase/anti-σ factor domain). Strikingly, all of the CrsR homologs were found in Proteobacteria with the exception of five homologs belonging to the Nitrospirae (one) and the Deferribacteres (four). These CrsR homologs were mainly present in the γ-Proteobacteria class, although several representatives also appeared in the α-, β-, δ-, and ϵ-Proteobacteria classes. Interestingly, no CrsR homolog was identified in the Enterobacteriales. Indeed, they were rather found in several other orders of the γ-Proteobacteria with three of them containing about 80% of the CrsR homologs (namely the Alteromonadales to which the Shewanellaceae belongs, the Pseudomonadales, and the Vibrionales). A phylogenetic tree was then constructed using a subset of representative CrsR homologs (see “Experimental procedures”) (Fig. 4). The genetic environment (DNA length ≤20 kb) of the corresponding crsR genes was then analyzed seeking for crsA. We identified genes encoding CrsA homologs nearby the crsR genes in the majority of the bacterial genomes analyzed (45 of 59 CrsR homologs; Fig. 4). These results led us to propose that the CrsR-CrsA partner-switching system is widespread among the Proteobacteria and thus to suggest that this mechanism of posttranslational regulation of σ is almost general in aquatic proteobacteria. When searching for CrsR homologs in the sequence data bank as we did for the phylogenic study, the well studied anti-σ factors such as SpoIIAB, RsbW, and SypE were not hits. A possible explanation for this is that SpoIIAB and RsbW are organized as a single domain, and the organization of the three domains of SypE is different from that of CrsR. In fact, analysis of the sequence alignment of CrsRD3 with these three anti-σ factors and CrsRD3 homologs obtained from the phylogenic tree highlights an additional region present in CrsRD3. Interestingly, this region is conserved in anti-σ factor domains of CrsR homologs presented in Fig. 4 (Fig. 5A). The extra region stretches from Leu-469 to Ser-496 (S. oneidensis CrsR numbering) between the N and G1 boxes, which are conserved motifs of the GHKL ATPase/kinase superfamily (Fig. 5A). On the basis of solved structures of anti-σ factor proteins, the predictive model of the 3D structure of CrsRD3 was designed using the I-TASSER program (14.Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4691) Google Scholar). The structural organization of the stretch of 28 amino acids described above was simulated as an unfolded loop (from Leu-469 to Asp-488) followed by a short α-helix (from Ser-489 to Arg-493) at the surface of the protein (Fig. 5B). This additional region defines a new class of anti-σ factors. We have recently shown that σS is regulated by a partner switch in S. oneidensis (7.Bouillet S. Genest O. Jourlin-Castelli C. Fons M. Méjean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. The general stress response σS is regulated by a partner switch in the Gram-negative bacterium Shewanella oneidensis.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 26151-26163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). CrsRD3 is an anti-σ factor domain that sequesters σS in the absence of stress. In starvation condition (stationary phase), σS is released from CrsR due to the binding of the anti-σ factor antagonist CrsA to CrsRD3. Phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of CrsA results from the action of either the kinase of CrsRD3 or the phosphatase of CrsRD2, respectively (Fig. 1). In the absence of stress, CrsRD2 is inactive, CrsA is phosphorylated by CrsRD3, and CrsA-P cannot bind CrsR. In this study, we show that CrsR protects σS against proteolysis under no-stress condition. We also observed that σS induced dps during the early stationary phase (Fig. 2), and the induction level remains constant from early to late stationary phases. This result strongly suggests that the entire pool of σS is released from CrsR when cells enter stationary phase. It will be interesting to confirm this possible on/off mechanism using other σS-dependent genes and various stresses, although transcriptional regulation could partially contribute to σS regulon induction. Another striking point is that dps is also induced in a ΔcrsR mutant, but the induction level increased slightly during the stationary phase, and it did not reach that of the wild-type strain. We thus propose that an additional regulatory mechanism operates during the stationary phase, possibly by inactivating the protease targeting σS or by protecting σS with a specific escort protein produced during the stationary phase. In contrast to σS of E. coli, σS of S. oneidensis is not degraded by the Clp protease in our experimental condition. These data confirm that the posttranslational regulations of σS of E. coli and S. oneidensis have no similarity. In E. coli, σS is degraded in the absence of stress. Therefore, σS must be synthesized de novo during stressful conditions, and the response is thus delayed, reaching its maximum during the late stationary phase (1.Hengge R.

The response regulator RssB, a recognition factor for σS proteolysis in Escherichia coli, can act like an anti-σS factor.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In S. oneidensis, σS is always available and can quickly activate the target genes in the presence of a stress, allowing an efficient cell adaptation. We suppose that, when the stress disappears, CrsR could again sequester σS. If true, this partner switch allows a rapid and reversible answer with a low energy cost. Interestingly, the protective role of an anti-σ factor was previously described for σT in the Gram-positive Streptomyces coelicolor (16.Mao X.-M. Ren N.-N. Sun N. Wang F. Zhou R.-C. Tang Y. Li Y.-Q. Proteasome involvement in a complex cascade mediating SigT degradation during differentiation of Streptomyces coelicolor.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The preservation of the σ factor even when no signal is present could be an efficient way to adapt for bacteria living in versatile biotopes. A similar effect was also observed for the flagellar σ factor FliA, which is protected by the anti-σ factor FlgM (17.Barembruch C. Hengge R. Cellular levels and activity of the flagellar σ factor FliA of Escherichia coli are controlled by FlgM-modulated proteolysis.Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 76-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified a large family of proteobacterial proteins homologous to CrsR of S. oneidensis. It is striking that among the analyzed bacteria, including Shewanella sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Vibrio sp., many live in aquatic environments and have to deal with a wider range of stresses than E. coli and other enterobacteria that live in more restricted habitats. In addition, the CrsR-CrsA partner switch homologs could be involved in the regulation of other alternative σ factors. Indeed, although α-Proteobacteria do not possess a σS homolog, but instead have a σEcfG factor, CrsR-CrsA partner switch is conserved in some of them (18.Österberg S. del Peso-Santos T. Shingler V. Regulation of alternative σ factor use.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2011; 65: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19.Fiebig A. Herrou J. Willett J. Crosson S.

The general stress response in Alphaproteobacteria.Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23: 164-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For example, Magnetococcus marinus MC1 does not encode the NepR-PhyR proteins that usually regulate σEcfG but possesses crsA and crsR homologs (Fig. 4). Taken together, these data suggest that the CrsR-CrsA partner switch is a widespread regulatory system involved in the posttranslational regulation of GSR σ factors. Finally, in this study, we identified a region of the D3 domain specific to anti-σ factors of the CrsR family comprising a loop between the N and G1 conserved boxes found in kinase sequences (Fig. 5A). This 28-amino acid loop is characteristic of CrsR homologs presenting the same three-domain organization and thus could be the trademark of a new family of anti-σ factors found in various classes of the phylum Proteobacteria (Fig. 4). The structure prediction of this region suggests no particular fold, whereas the rest of the domain can be modeled following SpoIIAB structure (9.Campbell E.A. Masuda S. Sun J.L. Muzzin O. Olson C.A. Wang S. Darst S.A. Crystal structure of the Bacillus stearothermophilus anti-σ factor SpoIIAB with the sporulation σ factor σF.Cell. 2002; 108: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This potentially disordered extension located on the surface of the domain is reminiscent of that observed in NepR of α-Proteobacteria; however, although NepR and CrsR are both anti-σ factor proteins, they are not related. The disordered region of NepR was shown to participate in the binding of its substrates (PhyR and σEcfG) (19.Fiebig A. Herrou J. Willett J. Crosson S. General stress signaling in the Alphaproteobacteria.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2015; 49: 603-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21.Herrou J. Willett J.W. Crosson S. Structured and dynamic disordered domains regulate the activity of a multifunctional anti-σ factor.mBio. 2015; 6: e00910-e00915Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether the additional extension is also involved in the binding of CrsR partners. Unfortunately, so far any modification of this region leads to instable variants, allowing no conclusion about the role of this extra region. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the role of CrsR toward σS during the exponential phase of bacterial growth. Indeed, it is now clear that, in the absence of stress, the interaction between the two proteins leads to protection of σS. The latter can be released from CrsR as soon as CrsA is dephosphorylated when an environmental stress signal is detected by a yet unknown signal transduction pathway. This mechanism, which is highly conserved among proteobacteria, could allow a faster adaptation of the bacteria under versatile conditions. Strains were routinely grown in LB medium at 28 and 37 °C for S. oneidensis and E. coli, respectively (22.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

When appropriate, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 25 μg/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml; and chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml.

The coding sequence of crsR (SO2119) was then cloned in-frame after a consensus σ70 promoter sequence (TTGACAN17TATAAT) and a consensus ribosome-binding site sequence (AGGAGA) into modified pKNG101, introduced into E. coli CC118λpir, and then transferred to ΔcrsR as described before for deletion mutants (7.Bouillet S.

The pKNG101 vector containing the dps-lacZ fusion was then transferred to ΔcrsR/crsR strain by conjugation as described previously (7.Bouillet S. Genest O. Jourlin-Castelli C. Fons M. Méjean V.

The following plasmids were used in this study. pBrpoS corresponds to the pBAD33 vector carrying the rpoS (SO3432) coding sequence in-frame with an N-terminal StrepTagII sequence. pETσS-52 vector corresponds to the pET-52b vector carrying the rpoS (SO3432) sequence (7.Bouillet S.

To follow the activity of the dps-lacZ fusion in stationary phase, the strains were grown at 28 °C anaerobically in LB medium supplemented with trimethylamine oxide (TMAO; 10 mm) as the final electron acceptor (26.Lemaire O.N. Honoré F.A. Jourlin-Castelli C. Méjean V. Fons M. Iobbi-Nivol C. Efficient respiration on TMAO requires TorD and TorE auxiliary proteins in Shewanella oneidensis.Res.

Samples of cultures were collected at different times, and β-galactosidase activities were measured in Miller units as described previously (22.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). CrsR protein was produced from MR1-R strains containing the plasmids p33Tac and pTCrsR. At an A600 of 0.4, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added to overproduce the protein. Cells were then grown for an additional 2 h, collected by centrifugation, washed with Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, and lysed by adding 1:10 PopCulture® reagent (Novagen®) and lysozyme (1 mg/ml final concentration). The crude extracts were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min (27.Thibodeau S.A. Fang R. Joung J.K. High-throughput β-galactosidase assay for bacterial cell-based reporter systems.BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 410-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MR1-R and ΔclpP strains were harvested during exponential growth, and crude extracts were prepared as above. Crude extracts were then diluted to 5 mg/ml total proteins in Tris-HCl pH 7.6 buffer, and reactions were started by adding 0.5 μm σS protein. Samples were incubated at 25 °C, and aliquots were collected at times 0 and 2 h or 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h. Loading buffer was added, and samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before migration by electrophoresis using a BoltTM 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were then visualized after Western blotting using StrepTactin probe HRP-conjugated antibody (IBA). σS protein was produced from MR1-R, ΔcrsR, and ΔcrsA strains containing the plasmid pBRpoS. Cells were grown for 1 h before 0.02% arabinose was added, and cells were incubated for 2 h under shaking. The crude extracts were prepared and treated as described above. σS was visualized after Western blotting using anti-σS rabbit antibody (a gift from Susan Gottesman) followed by anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The proteins sharing homologies with CrsR were found in the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database using the protein BLAST search tool. For phylogenetic tree construction, the searches were made independently on the different classes of Proteobacteria (α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ϵ-Proteobacteria) as well as on bacteria with the exclusion of the Proteobacteria. For the γ-Proteobacteria, the searches were made separately on each order comprising this class. One representative sequence for each genus was subsequently selected except for Shewanella, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas. We chose the proteins sharing the highest E-value with CrsR on the whole length of the proteins. For the phylogenetic analysis, we used Phylogeny.fr software in the “one-click” mode, i.e. with the default parameters optimized by the authors (28.Dereeper A. Guignon V. Blanc G. Audic S. Buffet S.

The main steps performed by this software correspond to multiple alignments of the CrsR homologs using the MUSCLE version 3.8.31 method, alignment curation by GBlocks version 0.9b, and phylogeny using the PhyML version 3.1 method using 100 bootstrap replicates. For the tree rendering step, we used the software FigTree version 1.4.2 (29.Drummond A.J. Suchard M.A. Xie D. Rambaut A. Bayesian phylogenetics with BEAUti and the BEAST 1.7.Mol. Biol.

After the first phylogenetic analysis, we manually removed the unnecessary sequences, and a second phylogenetic analysis was performed. The neighborhood of the genes coding for the CrsR homologs was extracted from the databases using NCBI, Microbial Genome Annotation and Analysis Platform (MaGe) (30.Vallenet D. Calteau A.

HATPase domains from these proteins and SypE (from V. fisheri) and RsbW and SpoIIAB (from B. subtilis) were aligned using the Clustal Omega program (European Molecular Biology Laboratory), and the highlighted and conserved amino acid residues were generated using the BoxShade (ExPASy) server. The secondary structure of CrsRD3 was predicted using the PSIRED server (32.Jones D.T. Protein secondary structure prediction based on position-specific scoring matrices.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4460) Google Scholar) (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/).4 The structure of CrsRD3 was predicted using the I-TASSER server, and the model having the highest C-score (−1.14) was annotated and is shown in Fig. 5B (14.Roy A.

Metabolic compensation allows circadian oscillators to run with a constant speed at different substrate levels and, therefore, is a substantial criterion of a robust rhythm in a changing environment. Because previous data have suggested a central role of RAS2-mediated signaling in the adaptation of yeast to different nutritional environments, we examined the involvement of RAS2 in the metabolic regulation of the clock in the circadian model organism Neurospora crassa. We show that, in a ras2-deficient strain, the period is longer than in the control. Moreover, unlike in the WT, in Δras2, operation of the circadian clock was affected by glucose; compared with starvation conditions, the period was longer and the oscillation of expression of the frequency (frq) gene was dampened. In constant darkness, the delayed phosphorylation of the FRQ protein and the long-lasting accumulation of FRQ in the nucleus were in accordance with the longer period and the less robust rhythm in the mutant. Although glucose did not affect the subcellular distribution of FRQ in the WT, highly elevated FRQ levels were detected in the nucleus in Δras2. RAS2 interacted with the RAS-binding domain of the adenylate cyclase in vitro, and the cAMP analogue 8-bromo-cyclic AMP partially rescued the circadian phenotype in vivo. We therefore propose that RAS2 acts via a cAMP-dependent pathway and exerts significant metabolic control on the Neurospora circadian clock.

Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated at the cellular level. Core clock mechanisms control rhythmic expression of a large set of genes, which, in turn, regulate various biological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. An important feature of the circadian clock is the ability to display an endogenous rhythm with a constant period length under different environmental conditions. Among these adaptation mechanisms, the most intensively investigated process is temperature compensation. Although a tight interaction between metabolism and the circadian clock has been shown at almost all levels of organisms (1.Eckel-Mahan K. Sassone-Corsi P.

Dunlap J.C. The circadian system as an organizer of metabolism.Fungal Genet. Biol. 2016; 90: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), it is still poorly understood how molecular timekeeping is compensated against changes in nutrient availability. Neurospora crassa belongs to the most extensively examined model systems in the field of circadian research and has served as a useful tool for the investigation of different aspects of circadian regulation, including metabolic compensation of the circadian clock (4.Sancar G.

Monitoring the conidiation rhythm, the time-dependent formation of asexual spores, allows easy study of the effect of genetic changes or pharmacologic manipulations on the output of the circadian oscillator (5.Borkovich K.A.

Other important regulators of the molecular oscillator include kinases, phosphatases, exosome components, and factors controlling the chromatin status (e.g. Refs. 8.Cha J. Zhou M. Liu Y.

FRQ undergoes several steps of phosphorylation that affect distinct functions of the protein (15.Larrondo L.F. Olivares-Yañez C. Baker C.L. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C.

Cell. 2011; 43: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Shortly after its synthesis, low levels of hypophosphorylated FRQ forms are accumulated in the nucleus and are efficient in negative feedback. In later phases of the circadian cycle, hyperphosphorylation of FRQ interferes with nuclear import of the protein, and the cytoplasmic FRQ supports accumulation of the WCC, thereby forming the positive feedback loop. Hyperphosphorylated FRQ interacts with F-box/WD-40 repeat-containing protein (FWD-1), which facilitates ubiquitination and, thus, degradation of the protein (18.He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. He Q. Yu H. Liu Y. FWD1-mediated degradation of FREQUENCY in Neurospora establishes a conserved mechanism for circadian clock regulation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4421-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). When FRQ is cleared from the nucleus, the WCC is gradually released from inhibition, and a new cycle starts. The WCC is also the main photoreceptor of Neurospora, controlling transcription of light-inducible genes and transducing light inputs to the circadian oscillator (19.Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Magrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G.

In light/dark cycles, the light-inducible blue light receptor VIVID inhibits the light-activated WCC by forming an additional negative feedback loop (23.Chen C.H. DeMay B.S. Gladfelter A.S.

Regarding the interconnections between metabolism and circadian timekeeping, the period of the Neurospora clock was shown to be independent of the glucose concentration of the medium, and conidial separation 1 (SCP-1), an important regulator of energy metabolism, was characterized as a key component of the adaptation of clock function to different sugar availabilities (4.Sancar G. Sancar C. Brunner M. Metabolic compensation of the Neurospora clock by a glucose-dependent feedback of the circadian repressor CSP1 on the core oscillator.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). According to the model of metabolic compensation proposed by Sancar et al. (4.Sancar G. Sancar C. Brunner M. Metabolic compensation of the Neurospora clock by a glucose-dependent feedback of the circadian repressor CSP1 on the core oscillator.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), glucose generally increases the rate of protein synthesis and, thus, translation of WC-1, the limiting subunit of the WCC. Glucose-dependent suppression of wc-1 transcription by CSP1, however, compensates for the translation elevation, resulting in glucose-independent expression of the WCC and, thus, stabilization of the period. Recently, PERIOD 1 (PRD-1), an RNA helicase, was also found to control cycle length in the presence of glucose (26.Emerson J.M. Bartholomai B.M. Ringelberg C.S. Baker S.E. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. period-1 encodes an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that influences nutritional compensation of the Neurospora circadian clock.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In yeast, the RAS-mediated pathway is central in the signal transduction of glucose sensing. This pathway controls the transcription of at least one hundred genes and thus contributes to the adaptation of cellular functions to changes in the metabolic environment (28.Conrad M. Schothorst J. Kankipati H.N. Van Zeebroeck G. Rubio-Texeira M. Thevelein J.M. Nutrient sensing and signaling in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38: 254-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 29.Santangelo G.M. Glucose signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 253-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Because yeast cells and N. crassa express similar RAS proteins (30.Lee N. Kronstad J.W. ras2 controls morphogenesis, pheromone response, and pathogenicity in the fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis.Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the Neurospora clock is thoroughly characterized at the molecular level, Neurospora may represent a good tool for the investigation of the interactions between RAS signaling and metabolic regulation of the circadian clock. RAS small G proteins are universal eukaryotic signal transducers that belong to the superfamily of small monomeric GTPases. In most organisms, several RAS isoforms are expressed. Although they share common sets of upstream regulators and downstream effectors, various experimental data support the functional specificity of the different RAS isoforms (31.Castellano E. Santos E. Functional specificity of ras isoforms: so similar but so different.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2: 216-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). RAS proteins play a critical role in the regulation of metabolism, cell growth, proliferation, and oncogenic transformation (32.Buday L. Downward J. Many faces of Ras activation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 178-187PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Weeks G. Spiegelman G.B. Roles played by Ras subfamily proteins in the cell and developmental biology of microorganisms.Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 901-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), all representing processes that are interlinked with the circadian rhythm. Indeed, an increasing body of evidence suggest interconnections between RAS-mediated pathways and the circadian clock in different organisms. Expression of RAS family members was found to be regulated by the circadian clock in some mammalian tissues (34.Duffield G.E. Best J.D. Meurers B.H. Bittner A. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C.

In Neurospora, activating mutation of RAS-1 (present in the band (bd) strain) enhances the conidiation rhythm and light-induced transcription of the positive factor WC-1 (46.Belden W.J. Larrondo L.F.

Reactive oxygen species can modulate circadian phase and period in Neurospora crassa.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2013; 58: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although, in most cases, the molecular basis is not well understood, RAS GTPases seem to be involved in clock control mechanisms in higher organisms as well. In Drosophila, RAS regulates the activity of the positive clock factor CLOCK/CYCLE (48.Weber F. Hung H.C. Maurer C. Kay S.A.

In mice, the dexamethasone-induced RAS protein 1 (DEXRAS1) is suggested to be an input factor of the circadian clock (49.Bouchard-Cannon P. Cheng H.Y.

Both experimental data and bioinformatic analysis suggest that oncogenic RAS proteins are involved in deregulation of the circadian clock in cancer cells (53.Relógio A. Thomas P. Medina-Pérez P. Reischl S. Bervoets S. Gloc E. Riemer P. Mang-Fatehi S. Maier B. Schäfer R. Leser U. Herzel H. Kramer A. Sers C. Ras-mediated deregulation of the circadian clock in cancer.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004338Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Finally, it was recently shown that RAS signaling affects the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of mice, acting, at least partially, via ERK and glycogen synthase kinase, thereby fine-tuning the circadian period (54.Serchov T. Jilg A. Wolf C.T. Radtke I. Stehle J.H. Heumann R. Ras activity oscillates in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus and modulates circadian clock dynamics.Mol. Neurobiol. 2016; 53: 1843-1855Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our goal in this study was to investigate whether RAS2 is involved in metabolic compensation of the circadian clock of N. crassa. Our results indicate that stability of the molecular clock function against changes in glucose availability is dependent on RAS2. We show that both phosphorylation and subcellular localization of FRQ are dependent on RAS2. We propose that RAS2, acting via a cAMP-dependent pathway, links the molecular oscillator to the glucose-sensing pathway and therefore is an important component of the nutritional compensation of the circadian period. To study the possible interplay between the RAS2-mediated signal transduction pathway and the circadian clock, we aimed to examine the circadian behavior of the ras2 deletion strain. Δras2 (FGSC 12467) was generated during the Neurospora Genome Project (55.Colot H.V. Park G. Turner G.E. Ringelberg C. Crew C.M. Litvinkova L. Weiss R.L. Borkovich K.A. Dunlap J.C. A high-throughput gene knockout procedure for Neurospora reveals functions for multiple transcription factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10352-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) and had a phenotype similar to that of the smco7 mutant described earlier (56.Kana-uchi A. Yamashiro C.T. Tanabe S. Murayama T. A ras homologue of Neurospora crassa regulates morphology.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). On agar slants, Δras2 formed less aerial hyphae than the WT and, accordingly, produced relatively few conidia, located primarily in a crescent form at the upper top of the medium (Fig. 1A). When inoculated in liquid medium, Δras2 grew slowly compared with the WT and produced mycelia dominantly in colonial form (small balls) instead of mycelial mats (supplemental Fig. S1A). To confirm that deletion of ras2 is responsible for the morphological defects of the mutant, we generated a strain expressing a tagged form of RAS2 under the control of the cpc-1 promoter in the Δras2 background. Comparable ras2 transcript levels were detected in Δras2, cpc-1-ras2 and the WT, and an anti-FLAG antibody recognized a protein band with the expected molecular mass (29.5 kDa) in the total cell lysates of Δras2, cpc-1-ras2 but detected no signal in the lysates prepared from either Δras2 or WT cells (Fig. 1B). Expression of RAS2FLAG rescued the morphological defects observed in the mutant, indicating that the fusion protein is functionally active and that the altered morphology was a consequence of ras2 deficiency (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1A). To analyze the conidiation rhythm of Δras2, race tube assays were performed under constant conditions (Fig. 1C). Similar to the smco7 mutant (56.Kana-uchi A. Yamashiro C.T. Tanabe S. Murayama T. A ras homologue of Neurospora crassa regulates morphology.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Δras2 had a reduced growth rate compared with the WT. In accordance with literature data (7.Gyöngyösi N. Káldi K. Interconnections of reactive oxygen species homeostasis and circadian rhythm in Neurospora crassa.Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2014; 20: 3007-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 46.Belden W.J. Larrondo L.F. Froehlich A.C. Shi M. Chen C.H. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. The band mutation in Neurospora crassa is a dominant allele of ras-1 implicating RAS signaling in circadian output.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1494-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), WT Neurospora did not display a conidiation rhythm on minimal medium but showed sustained banding when the reactive oxygen species generator menadione was present. In Δras2, however, no conidiation rhythm was detected, even when high concentrations (100 μm) of menadione were applied, suggesting that deletion of ras2 affects the rhythmic output. Because entrained conditions generally support conidiation rhythm (47.Gyöngyösi N. Nagy D. Makara K. Ella K. Káldi K. Reactive oxygen species can modulate circadian phase and period in Neurospora crassa.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2013; 58: 134-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we incubated race tube cultures in 12/12-h light/dark cycles. Under these conditions, Δras2 also displayed sustained banding for several days (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, when the phase of conidiation was thoroughly analyzed and compared with that of the WT, a significant delay was observed in Δras2, suggesting that RAS2 activity also affects clock function under entrained conditions (Fig. 1D). In Δras2, cpc-1-ras2, the phase of banding was similar to the phase detected in the WT, indicating that expression of RAS2FLAG in the mutant background results in rescue of the clock function. To further analyze the effect of ras2 deficiency on clock function, we generated a Δras2 strain that expressed luciferase under the control of the frq promoter. In the first experiments, we used a medium containing no glucose and followed the rhythm of frq promoter activity in constant darkness (Fig. 2A, top panel). Although a robust rhythm was detected in both the Δras2 and the WT background, the circadian period was significantly longer in the mutant than in the control strain, suggesting that RAS2-mediated signaling interacts with the molecular clock (Fig. 2B). As expected from earlier data (4.Sancar G. Sancar C. Brunner M. Metabolic compensation of the Neurospora clock by a glucose-dependent feedback of the circadian repressor CSP1 on the core oscillator.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), addition of glucose to the medium did not affect either the robustness or period of the rhythm in the WT (Fig. 2, A, bottom panel, and B). In the ras2-deficient strain, however, a dampening in the amplitude was observed, and the period was more than 2 h longer compared with the WT. These data indicate that compensation of the oscillator function against glucose requires the action of RAS2. Next, we examined whether expression of ras2 is controlled by the circadian clock in the WT. As shown in Fig. 3, although frq levels displayed rhythmic changes in our samples, ras2 mRNA did not oscillate, indicating that ras2 is not a clock-controlled gene in Neurospora. In the"

Fifty-three rats were randomized to 6 groups according to diet and training regimen as follows: CD and sedentary (CS, n = 11), CD and ME (CME, n = 8), CD and HI (CHI, n = 8), HFD and sedentary (HS, n = 10), HFD and ME (HME, n = 8), and HFD and HI (HHI, n = 8). All exercise groups were trained for 10 weeks and had matched running distances. Dietary intake, body composition, blood metabolites, and corticosterone levels were measured. Histological lipid droplets were observed in the livers. The HFD led to hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and higher body fat (all, P < 0.01, η2 > 0.06), as well as higher corticosterone levels (P < 0.01, η2 = 0.09) compared with the CD groups. Exercise training improved fat weight, glucose, and lipid profiles, and reduced corticosterone levels (P < 0.01, η2 = 0.123). Furthermore, body and fat weight, serum glucose and triglycerides, lipid content in the liver, and corticosterone levels (P < 0.05) were lower with HI training compared to ME training. Reductions in HFD-induced body weight gain, blood glucose and lipid profiles, and corticosterone levels, as well as improvements in QUICKI were better with HHI compared to HME. Correlation analyses revealed that corticosterone levels were significantly associated with phenotype variables (P < 0.01). Corticosterone level was inversely correlated with QUICKI (r = −0.38, P < 0.01). Altogether, these results indicate that HFD may elicit an exacerbated basal serum corticosterone level and thus producing a metabolic imbalance. Compared with ME training, HI training contributes to greater improvements in metabolic and corticosterone responses, leading to a greater reduction in susceptibility to HFD-induced disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2738527595,"Active Hexose Correlated Compound (AHCC) has been shown to have many immunostimulatory and anti-cancer activities in mice and in humans. As a natural product, AHCC has potential to create safer adjuvant therapies in cancer patients. Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the least curable and second-most common leukemia in adults. AML is especially terminal to those over 60 years old, where median survival is only 5 to 10 months, due to inability to receive intensive chemotherapy. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of AHCC on AML cells both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that AHCC induced Caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in AML cell lines as well as in primary AML leukopheresis samples. Additionally, AHCC induced Caspase-8 cleavage as well as Fas and TRAIL upregulation, suggesting involvement of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In contrast, monocytes from healthy donors showed suppressed Caspase-3 cleavage and lower cell death. When tested in a murine engraftment model of AML, AHCC led to significantly increased survival time and decreased blast counts. These results uncover a mechanism by which AHCC leads to AML-cell specific death, and also lend support for the further investigation of AHCC as a potential adjuvant for the treatment of AML."

However, it is unknown whether a surgeon's research productivity could be related to outcomes. The main aim of this study is to investigate the association between the surgeon's academic productivity and clinical outcomes following neurosurgical clipping of ruptured aneurysms.We performed a post-hoc analysis of 3567 patients who underwent clipping of ruptured intracranial aneurysms in the randomized trials of tirilazad mesylate from 1990 to 1997. These trials included 162 centers and 156 surgeons from 21 countries. Primary and secondary outcomes were: Glasgow outcome scale score and mortality, respectively. Total publications, H-index, and graduate degrees were used as academic indicators for each surgeon. The association between outcomes and academic factors were assessed using a hierarchical logistic regression analysis, adjusting for patient covariates.Academic profiles were available for 147 surgeons, treating a total of 3307 patients. Most surgeons were from the USA (62, 42%), Canada (18, 12%), and Germany (15, 10%). On univariate analysis, the H-index correlated with better functional outcomes and lower mortality rates. In the multivariate model, patients under the care of surgeons with higher H-indices demonstrated improved neurological outcomes (p = 0.01) compared to surgeons with lower H-indices, without any significant difference in mortality. None of the other academic indicators were significantly associated with outcomes.Although prognostication following surgery for ruptured intracranial aneurysms primarily depends on clinical and radiological factors, the academic impact of the operating neurosurgeon may explain some heterogeneity in surgical outcomes."

In this setting we would like to gauge physicians' knowledge, acquaintance with and attitude to include PrEP in their clinical practice. A cross sectional survey was conducted among Italian physicians expert on antiretroviral therapy. Out of 146 physicians, 35% of participants declared to be familiar with PrEP but only 46% of them believed that, currently, there are not enough reasons to make it available in Italy. 51% of physicians have already been attracted to prescribe it and 63.4% have been openly asked about PrEP. The main concerns noticed were: the risk of acquire other sexual transmitted diseases (STDs) (70% of physicians feared that PrEP could favor STDs spread), the potential harmful of PrEP if not adequately implemented and, especially the risk of possible side effects if not properly used. Nevertheless, 55.9% of participants believed that Health Authorities face an ethical obligation to make PrEP available as part of the strategies to protect from HIV transmission and half of the respondents asked for further researches to better define the role for PrEP. Attitudes regarding PrEP impact on Italian National Health Organization were also very interesting: 57.5% of participants did not believe that investing in PrEP would be an appropriate use of healthcare resources, while 70.6% affirmed that PrEP's financial coverage should not be funded by the Italian National System of Health (SSN). This survey showed a high awareness of PrEP potential among Italian physicians coupled with a great deal of skepticism about how and if implementing it in clinical practice."

An analysis of the chromosomal banding patterns of 607 larvae of S. guianense s. l. revealed a high level of variation involving 83 macrogenomic rearrangements across 25 populations in Brazil, French Guiana, and Venezuela. The 25 populations were assigned to 13 cytoforms (A1, A2, B1–B4, C, D, E1–E4, and F), some of which are probably valid species. Based on geographical proximity, a member of the B group of cytoforms probably represents the name-bearing type specimen of S. guianense and the primary vector in the last-remaining onchocerciasis foci in the Western Hemisphere. Cytoform B3 in Amapá State is implicated as an anthropophilic simuliid in an area currently and historically free of onchocerciasis. Distributions of cytoforms are associated with geography, elevation, and drainage basin, and are largely congruent with ecoregions. Despite extraordinarily large larval populations of S. guianense s. l. in big rivers and consequent production of female flies for dispersal, the cytoforms maintain their chromosomal distinction within individual rivers, suggesting a high degree of fidelity to the specialized breeding habitats—rocky shoals—of the natal rivers."
https://openalex.org/W2736464999,"Kalman filtering methods have long been regarded as efficient adaptive Bayesian techniques for estimating hidden states in models of linear dynamical systems under Gaussian uncertainty. Recent advents of the Cubature Kalman filter (CKF) have extended this efficient estimation property to nonlinear systems, and also to hybrid nonlinear problems where by the processes are continuous and the observations are discrete (continuous-discrete CD-CKF). Employing CKF techniques, therefore, carries high promise for modeling many biological phenomena where the underlying processes exhibit inherently nonlinear, continuous, and noisy dynamics and the associated measurements are uncertain and time-sampled. This paper investigates the performance of cubature filtering (CKF and CD-CKF) in two flagship problems arising in the field of neuroscience upon relating brain functionality to aggregate neurophysiological recordings: (i) estimation of the firing dynamics and the neural circuit model parameters from electric potentials (EP) observations, and (ii) estimation of the hemodynamic model parameters and the underlying neural drive from BOLD (fMRI) signals. First, in simulated neural circuit models, estimation accuracy was investigated under varying levels of observation noise (SNR), process noise structures, and observation sampling intervals (dt). When compared to the CKF, the CD-CKF consistently exhibited better accuracy for a given SNR, sharp accuracy increase with higher SNR, and persistent error reduction with smaller dt. Remarkably, CD-CKF accuracy shows only a mild deterioration for non-Gaussian process noise, specifically with Poisson noise, a commonly assumed form of background fluctuations in neuronal systems. Second, in simulated hemodynamic models, parametric estimates were consistently improved under CD-CKF. Critically, time-localization of the underlying neural drive, a determinant factor in fMRI-based functional connectivity studies, was significantly more accurate under CD-CKF. In conclusion, and with the CKF recently benchmarked against other advanced Bayesian techniques, the CD-CKF framework could provide significant gains in robustness and accuracy when estimating a variety of biological phenomena models where the underlying process dynamics unfold at time scales faster than those seen in collected measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2736604955,"Lignin is a major obstacle for cost-effective conversion of cellulose into fermentable sugars. Non-productive adsorption onto insoluble lignin fragments and interactions with soluble phenols are important inhibition mechanisms of cellulases, including β-glucosidases. Here, we examined the inhibitory effect of tannic acid (TAN), a model polyphenolic compound, on β-glucosidases from the bacterium Thermotoga petrophila (TpBGL1 and TpBGL3) and archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (PfBGL1). The results revealed that the inhibition effects on β-glucosidases were TAN concentration-dependent. TpBGL1 and TpBGL3 were more tolerant to the presence of TAN when compared with PfBGL1, while TpBGL1 was less inhibited when compared with TpBGL3. In an attempt to better understand the inhibitory effect, the interaction between TAN and β-glucosidases were analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Furthermore, the exposed hydrophobic surface areas in β-glucosidases were analyzed using a fluorescent probe and compared with the results of inhibition and ITC. The binding constants determined by ITC for the interactions between TAN and β-glucosidases presented the same order of magnitude. However, the number of binding sites and exposed hydrophobic surface areas varied for the β-glucosidases studied. The binding between TAN and β-glucosidases were driven by enthalpic effects and with an unfavorable negative change in entropy upon binding. Furthermore, the data suggest that there is a high correlation between exposed hydrophobic surface areas and the number of binding sites on the inhibition of microbial β-glucosidases by TAN. These studies can be useful for biotechnological applications."

https://openalex.org/W2739454457,"Molting is an important physiological process in the larval stage of Bombyx mori and is controlled by various hormones and peptides. The silkworm mutant that exhibits the phenotype of non-molting in the 2nd instar (nm2) is incapable of molting in the 2nd instar and dies after seven or more days. The ecdysone titer in the nm2 mutant is lower than that in the wildtype, and the mutant can be rescued by feeding with 20E and cholesterol. The results of positional cloning indicated that structural alteration of BmCPG10 is responsible for the phenotype of the nm2 mutant. To explore the possible relationship between BmCPG10 and the ecdysone titer as well as the genes affected by BmCPG10, digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis was conducted in the nm2 mutant, with the wildtype strain C603 serving as the control. The results revealed 1727 differentially expressed genes, among which 651 genes were upregulated and 1076 were downregulated in nm2. BLASTGO analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes were involved in various biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. KEGG analysis indicated an enrichment of these differentially expressed genes in 240 pathways, including metabolic pathways, pancreatic secretion, protein digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption and glycerolipid metabolism. To verify the accuracy of the DGE results, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed, focusing on key genes in several related pathways, and the results were highly consistent with the DGE results. Our findings indicated significant differences in cuticular protein genes, ecdysone biosynthesis genes and ecdysone-related nuclear receptors genes, but no significant difference in juvenile hormone and chitin biosynthesis genes was detected. Our research findings lay the foundation for further research on the formation mechanism of the nm2 mutant."
https://openalex.org/W2611355934,"We study how large functional networks can grow stably under possible cascading overload failures and evaluated the maximum stable network size above which even a small-scale failure would cause a fatal breakdown of the network. Employing a model of cascading failures induced by temporally fluctuating loads, the maximum stable size $n_{\text{max}}$ has been calculated as a function of the load reduction parameter $r$ that characterizes how quickly the total load is reduced during the cascade. If we reduce the total load sufficiently fast ($r\ge r_{\text{c}}$), the network can grow infinitely. Otherwise, $n_{\text{max}}$ is finite and increases with $r$. For a fixed $r\,(<r_{\text{c}})$, $n_{\text{max}}$ for a scale-free network is larger than that for an exponential network with the same average degree. We also discuss how one detects and avoids the crisis of a fatal breakdown of the network from the relation between the sizes of the initial network and the largest component after an ordinarily occurring cascading failure."

Biologists Vicki Lundblad, 64, and Katherine Jones, 62, said in a pair of lawsuits filed in California Superior Court in San Diego on 11 July that their employer pressured them to downsize their labs, disparaged their work, and prevented them from being considered for lucrative grants. “Salk has allowed an ‘old boys club’ culture to dominate, creating a hostile work environment for the Salk tenured women professors,” Lundblad alleges. Salk’s female president, Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn, said the lawsuits “misrepresented” the institute. “I would never preside over an institute that in any way condoned, openly or otherwise, the marginalizing of female scientists,” she wrote in a statement. Blackburn also approved the institute’s release of statements attacking each woman’s scientific productivity and noting that neither had published in the top journals Cell, Nature, or Science in the last decade. Despite “millions of dollars” in Salk support, the statements argue, each woman has “consistently rank[ed] below her peers in producing high quality research and attracting the grants that could advance that research.” The personal attacks drew infuriated reactions on social media and in unsolicited emails to Science from prominent biologists, including four Nobel laureates."
