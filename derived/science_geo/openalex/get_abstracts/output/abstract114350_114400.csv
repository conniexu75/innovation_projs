https://openalex.org/W2108689038,"The structure of beta-amyloid (beta A) from Alzheimer disease brains was examined to determine if post-translational modifications might be linked to the abnormal deposition of this peptide in the diseased tissue. The beta A peptides were isolated from the compact amyloid cores of neuritic plaques and separated from minor glycoprotein components by size-exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). This parenchymal beta A has a maximal length of 42 residues, but shorter forms with ragged NH2 termini are also present. Tryptic peptide analysis revealed heterogeneity in the beta A1-5 and beta A6-16 peptides, each of which eluted as four peaks on reverse phase HPLC. Amino acid composition and sequence analyses, mass spectrometry, enzymatic methylation, and stereoisomer determinations revealed that these multiple peptide forms resulted from structural rearrangements of the aspartyl residues at beta A positions 1 and 7. The L-isoaspartyl form predominates at each of these positions, whereas the D-isoaspartyl, L-aspartyl, and D-aspartyl forms are present in lesser amounts. beta A purified from the leptomeningeal microvasculature contains the same structural alterations as parenchymal beta A, but is 2 residues shorter at its COOH terminus. Using two different purification protocols, and using a synthetic beta A1-42 peptide as a control, we show that these modifications arose endogenously and were not caused by the experimental manipulations. The abundance of structurally altered aspartyl residues may profoundly affect the conformation of the beta A protein within plaque cores and thus significantly impact normal catabolic processes designed to limit its deposition. These alterations may therefore contribute to the production and stability of beta-amyloid deposits in Alzheimer brain tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1545965226,"We have characterized a new selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase, GSHPx-GI, by expressing a GSHPx-GI cDNA isolated from human hepatoma HepG2 cells in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells, which have virtually undetectable expression of either the classical cellular enzyme, GSHPx-1, or GSHPx-GI at the protein level. One of the G418-resistant clones, neo-D1, expresses the transfected GSHPx-GI cDNA. This is based on 1) the presence of an additional GSHPx-GI DNA restriction fragment detected by Southern analysis; 2) the presence of a 1.9-kilobase (kb) GSHPx-GI mRNA in addition to the 1.0-kb endogenous mRNA by Northern analysis; and 3) the appearance of a 22-kDa 75Se-labeled protein which is absent in parental MCF-7 cells revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GSHPx-GI expressed in neo-D1 is a tetrameric protein localized in cytosol. GSHPx-GI does not cross-react with antisera against human GSHPx-1 or human plasma glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx-P). Similar substrate specificities are found for GSHPx-1 and GSHPx-GI; they both catalyze the reduction of H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide with glutathione, but not of phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. GSHPx-GI mRNA was readily detected in human liver and colon, and occasionally in human breast samples, but not other human tissues including kidney, heart, lung, placenta, or uterus. In rodent tissues, GSHPx-GI mRNA is only detected in the gastrointestinal tract, and not in other tissues including liver. In fact, GSHPx-GI appears to be the major glutathione-dependent peroxidase activity in rodent GI tract. This finding suggests that GSHPx-GI could play a major role in protecting mammals from the toxicity of ingested lipid hydroperoxides. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that GSHPx-GI is the fourth member in the selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase family, in addition to GSHPx-1, GSHPx-P, and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX)."
https://openalex.org/W1554535382,"We have analyzed the cellular processing pathways which produce the 4-kDa amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) and a 3-kDa derivative (p3) of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) found in conditioned media of tissue culture cells and in cerebrospinal fluid. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that both peptides are secreted in parallel with soluble beta APP (APPs); no precursor-product relation between A beta and p3 was found. The protease inhibitor leupeptin did not influence the production of either peptide. In contrast, the weak base ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) showed a dose-dependent inhibition of A beta production with less decrease in p3. A similar effect was observed using the monovalent ionophore monensin. Brefeldin A completely inhibited the generation of both peptides, indicating that proteases located in the endoplasmic reticulum or early Golgi are not sufficient for the production of the small peptides. Deletion of the beta APP cytoplasmic domain, which removes a consensus sequence that probably mediates reinternalization, caused an increase in secretion of both APPs and p3 and did not abolish A beta production. These observations suggest that completely mature beta APP within the late Golgi and/or at the cell surface is a prerequisite for A beta production but processing within the lysosome might not be directly required. p3 appears to derive from the 10-kDa C-terminal stub of beta APP following secretion of APPs."
https://openalex.org/W1501566065,"Apoptosis is a major form of cell death, characterized morphologically by chromatin condensation and biochemically by endonuclease cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments. Recently, we reported that zinc arrested dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in thymocytes at an early stage, as characterized morphologically by condensation of heterochromatin into clumps abutting the nuclear membrane. In this study, we show that zinc completely inhibits endonuclease cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments but does not prevent the cleavage of DNA into high molecular weight fragments. These results indicate that the formation of these high molecular weight fragments, which correlates with the very early morphological features of apoptosis, is a critical event in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. The formation of these high molecular weight fragments, despite the inhibition by zinc of the endonuclease cleavage of DNA, suggests that key enzyme(s), other than the Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease, are involved at the earliest stages of induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1601157315,"The lymphoid-specific transcription complex, NF-AT, is involved in early gene activation in T cells and is assembled from a pre-existing, T cell restricted cytoplasmic factor and an inducible ubiquitous nuclear component within 30 min after activation through the antigen receptor. Recent studies have implicated the family of AP1 factors as components of the murine NF-AT complex. Evidence is provided here that the nuclear component of human NF-AT contains the phorbol ester-inducible transcription factor AP1 (Jun/Fos). We further characterize which AP1 family members can assume this role. Antisera to Fos inhibits NF-AT DNA binding as does an oligonucleotide containing a binding site for AP1. Constitutive expression in vivo of Fos, and to a lesser extent Fra-1, eliminates the requirement for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, leaving NF-AT-directed transcription responsive to calcium ionophore alone. Overexpression of cJun or JunD, but not JunB, also eliminates the requirement for PMA, indicating that many but not all Jun- and Fos-related proteins functionally activate NF-AT-dependent transcription in the presence of the cytoplasmic component. NF-AT DNA binding can be reconstituted in vitro using semi-purified AP1 proteins mixed with cytosol from T lymphocytes. Fos proteins are not needed for this reconstitution, and although JunB is not functional, it can participate in the NF-AT DNA binding complex. Finally, we have partially purified the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT and show by elution and renaturation from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels that it has a molecular mass between 94 and 116 kDa and may have multiple differentially modified forms."
https://openalex.org/W2580627695,"Phi 29 DNA polymerase is able to catalyze two different synthetic reactions: protein-primed initiation and DNA polymerization. We have studied the fidelity of phi 29 DNA polymerase when carrying out these two reactions. Global fidelity was dissected into three steps: insertion discrimination, mismatch elongation, and proofreading. The insertion discrimination of phi 29 DNA polymerase in DNA polymerization ranged from 10(4) to 10(6). The efficiency of mismatch elongation was 10(5)-10(-6)-fold lower than that of a properly paired primer terminus. These factors indicate that DNA polymerization catalyzed by phi 29 DNA polymerase is a highly accurate process. Conversely, the insertion fidelity of protein-primed initiation was quite low, the insertion discrimination factor being about 10(2). Mismatch elongation discrimination was also rather low: mismatched terminal protein (TP).dNMP complexes were elongated from 2- to 6-fold more slowly than the correct TP.dNMP complex. Even more, the 3‘–>5‘ exonuclease activity of phi 29 DNA polymerase was unable to act on the TP.dNMP initiation complex, precluding the possibility that a wrong dNMP covalently linked to TP could be excised and corrected. Therefore, protein-primed initiation can be predicted as a quite inaccurate reaction. The problem of maintaining the sequence at the DNA ends is discussed in the context of a recently described model for protein-primed initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1565827383,"Since plasma protein S serves an anticoagulant function by mechanisms which are not completely understood, its possible interaction with Factor Va was investigated. Human protein S bound to immobilized human Factor Va in a calcium-dependent, saturable, and reversible manner and Factor Va bound similarly to immobilized protein S. Binding of protein S to immobilized Factor V was greatly enhanced by pretreatment of the surface-bound Factor V with increasing doses of thrombin up to 1 unit/ml. Binding of protein S to Factor Va was also demonstrated in fluid phase with a Kd of 33 +/- 9 nM. Biotin-labeled heavy chain of Factor Va bound to immobilized protein S, and this binding was reversed by a 17-fold molar excess of intact unlabeled Factor Va. Protein S competed efficiently with prothrombin for binding to immobilized Factor Va. The prothrombinase activity in a reaction mixture of purified clotting factors was inhibited by protein S and exhibited a pattern of mixed inhibition. The concentration of protein S needed for 50% inhibition of the prothrombinase activity of a mixture containing 1 nM Factor Xa, 20 pM Factor Va, and 50 microM phospholipids was about 16 nM. Since not all protein S preparations exhibited this degree of prothrombinase inhibitory activity, extensive control experiments were performed to verify that the inhibitory activity was associated with protein S during immunoaffinity chromatography and was not caused by traces of activated protein C in the protein S preparations. These data show that protein S has an anticoagulant function which is independent of activated protein C and, at least in part, that this is because of its competition with prothrombin for direct binding to Factor Va."
https://openalex.org/W1592007354,"Abstract N-Ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) is an essential component for protein transport between Golgi cisternae. Sequence analysis and proteolytic dissection reveal that NSF contains two tandem ATP domains, each containing the consensus sequence for the binding of nucleotide. When Escherichia coli-produced Chinese hamster ovary NSF is purified, it exhibits a low, but significant, ATPase activity. The ATPase activity of NSF is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and influenced by monoclonal antibodies against recombinant NSF."
https://openalex.org/W1497131246,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) markedly stimulates the synthesis and secretion of immunoreactive nerve growth factor (NGF) in quiescent mouse fibroblasts, which is a result of increase in the NGF mRNA level. NGF produced by TNF-treated fibroblasts has a molecular mass of 13 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which is consistent in size with the subunit of mouse beta-NGF, and induces neurite outgrowth in paravertebral sympathetic neurons. Several peptide growth factors such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth factor also stimulate NGF production in the cells, but not platelet-derived growth factor. The dose responses of TNF and bFGF to stimulate NGF production in the cells are, respectively, similar to those to induce cell proliferation. However, no correlation is observed between the ability of these growth factors to stimulate NGF production and that to induce cell proliferation. Thus, the stimulation of NGF production in the cells seems to be a specific activity of TNF and some other growth factors. TNF stimulates the synthesis and secretion of NGF also in other cells such as human glioblastoma cells. These findings suggest that TNF plays a role in regulating neuronal cell function through an indirect mechanism by which it stimulates NGF production in glial cells and fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1574510052,"Rat plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) mRNAs were examined by S1 nuclease protection (isoform 1) and polymerase chain reaction (isoforms 1, 2, 3, and 4) and the corresponding genes were analyzed to determine the tissue-specific splicing patterns involving exons encoding the calmodulin-binding domains and C termini. Splicing of PMCA1 involves a single 154-nucleotide exon that can be either included or excluded; when the exon is included four different splice donor sites, at positions 87, 114, 152, and 154, can be utilized. PMCA2 mRNAs are generated either by the inclusion of a 172-nucleotide exon, by the inclusion of both the 172-nucleotide exon and a 55-nucleotide exon, or by the exclusion of both exons. Four PMCA3 mRNAs arise by alternative splicing of a 154-nucleotide exon, in patterns that are analogous to those of PMCA1, and additional mRNAs are generated by the inclusion of a 68-nucleotide exon immediately before the 154-nucleotide exon. The simplest splicing pattern occurs in PMCA4, where a single 175-nucleotide exon is either included or excluded. The alternative mRNAs for each of the four genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and encode enzyme variants with different combinations of calmodulin-binding domains and C termini."
https://openalex.org/W1497342202,"Casein kinase II (CKII) is a highly conserved ubiquitous serine/threonine kinase composed of two catalytically active (alpha and/or alpha') and two regulatory (beta) subunits. It has been suspected that, among numerous other cellular functions, CKII might play a role in the control of mitogenic signaling. To test for such a role and its mechanism in intact cells, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated against CKII beta using a recombinant protein containing amino acids 20-200 of human CKII beta. The CKII beta-specific mAb with the highest reactivity, mAb IVG6 (classified as IgG1 with kappa light chains), was purified to homogeneity. It recognized a CKII beta epitope comprising the amino acids 140-156, a basic and highly conserved region. In addition, polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) were raised and made monospecific by affinity purification. pAbs-mediated quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy of human IMR-90 fibroblasts and/or Western blots of cell fractions revealed (i) CKII beta was present in exponentially growing cells at a 2-3-fold higher level than in quiescent cells, (ii) CKII beta was localized predominantly in the nucleus of cells (3-15-fold cytoplasmic level depending on cellular state and assay used), and (iii) the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of CKII beta was higher by a factor of 2 in exponentially growing cells. Consequently, mitogenic stimulation of quiescent cells by fetal calf serum doubled the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of CKII beta. The increase occurred within the 1st h of stimulation. The translocation of CKII beta into the nucleus was inhibited when mAb IVG6 was injected into the cytoplasm at the time of mitogenic stimulation. This microinjection also significantly inhibited the cell proliferation. The data imply that cytoplasmic CKII participates in the transmission of mitogenic signals by translocation into the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1483136397,"A protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) containing two SH2 domains (PTP1C) was purified to near homogeneity from an adenovirus expression system by a two-step chromatographic procedure with a yield of 67%. The purified enzyme behaves as a monomer of 68 kDa on gel filtration and is totally specific for phosphotyrosyl residues. Its optimal pH is around neutrality for protein substrates such as reduced, carboxyamidomethylated, maleylated (RCM)-lysozyme and myelin basic protein but below 5 for low molecular weight compounds such as para-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) and phosphotyrosine. Furthermore, with the protein substrates, it displays an activity less than 1% of that obtained with other known PTPs but comparable activities toward p-NPP and phosphotyrosine. Its responsiveness toward the usual PTP activators (e.g. spermine) or inhibitors (e.g. vanadate, molybdate, heparin, or Zn2+) varied considerably with the nature of the substrates involved. Limited digestion with trypsin caused the cleavage of a C-terminal segment of the enzyme, giving rise to a 63-kDa fragment; this cleavage resulted in an approximately 20- and 10-fold activation of the enzyme toward RCM-lysozyme and myelin basic protein, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1504775902,"Interleukin (IL)-1 refers to a group of three polypeptide hormones with a wide range of cellular targets. Two types of IL-1 receptor have been identified and characterized by cDNA cloning. Both human type I and type II IL-1 receptors contain extracellular domains of approximately 310 residues and a single membrane-spanning region. The type I receptor contains a cytoplasmic domain of 213 residues. The cytoplasmic region of the type II receptor is 29 residues in length. It has been found recently that a number of cells express both forms of receptor. By analogy with other cytokine receptor systems, the two IL-1 receptors might be expected to form a heterodimeric complex, the type II receptor being an alpha-chain-like structure, functioning only to bind ligand, and associating with the type I receptor (a beta-chain-like structure) which would transduce signals. In this report we show that this is not the case, but rather that IL-1, when complexed to type II receptor, cannot bind type I receptors, and vice versa. These data show that the complex patterns often observed for IL-1 binding to cells cannot be accounted for by the same type of mechanism that underlies the behavior of, for example, the IL-2 system."
https://openalex.org/W1574880565,"2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase, an enzyme of the biphenyl biodegradation pathway that cleaves the first of the aromatic rings, was purified to apparent homogeneity from Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400 that had been engineered to hyperexpress the bphC gene. The enzyme had a subunit molecular mass of 33.2 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Kinetic studies indicate a KM of 7 +/- 1 microM for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by substrate (Kss = 300 +/- 10 microM). Catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol were cleaved less efficiently and showed weaker substrate inhibition. 3,4-Dihydroxybiphenyl was not a substrate for the enzyme. Ammonium sulfate and polyethylene glycol 6000 were used as precipitants to obtain two different crystal forms. Crystals grown from ammonium sulfate and polyethylene glycol 6000 had space groups of P4(2)2(1)2 and I222, respectively. Electron microscopy indicates that the enzyme is an octamer (265 kDa) consisting of subunits arranged in two planar tetramers in a staggered conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1570419937,"The 49-kDa poly(A)-binding protein II (PAB II) was purified to homogeneity from calf thymus. The 70-kDa poly(A)-binding protein I (PAB I) was obtained in different fractions of the same preparation. Whereas PAB II stimulated poly(A) polymerase, PAB I was an inhibitor. In analytical ultracentrifugation, the predominant form of PAB II was a monomer of 50.3 kDa. A sedimentation constant of only 2.2 S indicated a distinctly non-spherical shape. Binding was specific for single-stranded purine polyribonucleotides. The dependence of the dissociation constant on the length of oligoriboadenylate indicated a binding site size of 12 nucleotides. A single site was bound with a KD of 2 x 10(-9) M, as determined by nitrocellulose filter binding assays. From fluorescence quenching and gel retardation experiments, the packing ratio on poly(A) was estimated as 23 nucleotides/protein monomer."
https://openalex.org/W1576992587,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a newly identified member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family (FGF-7). KGF is expressed by stromal fibroblasts and acts on epithelial cells in a paracrine mode. To facilitate structure/function studies, we utilized the T7 prokaryotic expression system to synthesize this growth factor. Recombinant KGF (rKGF) was mitogenic with a specific activity around 10-fold higher than native KGF. By in vitro mutagenesis, we generated a series of KGF mutants with sequential deletions of the amino-terminal domain, the most divergent region among different FGF members. Mutant proteins, produced in bacteria, were tested for their ability to bind heparin, bind and activate the KGF receptor, and induce DNA synthesis. Heparin binding properties were preserved with deletion of up to 28 amino-terminal residues of the mature KGF but lost by the deletion of an additional 10 residues. Biological activity of mutants with deletions of up to 10 residues was comparable to that of rKGF. However, deletion of 29 residues resulted in significantly reduced ability to stimulate KGF receptor tyrosine-kinase activity and DNA synthesis, although this mutant bound the receptor at high affinity. These characteristics of a partial agonist may be useful in the development of competitive antagonists of KGF action."
https://openalex.org/W1582678267,"Growth factors for rat primary glial cells were identified in conditioned medium of a human glioma-derived cell line. The factors, designated glia-activating factors (GAFs), were purified to homogeneity by a combination of heparin affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and high performance liquid chromatography on a heparin affinity column and a C4 reversed-phase column. GAFs could be resolved into three peaks by C4 column chromatography. The M(r) values of these three proteins were estimated to be 30,000, 29,000, and 25,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. These M(r) values were in good agreement with the value of 26,000 +/- 3,000 estimated from the elution volume upon gel filtration chromatography under nondenaturing conditions. These data suggested that each of the GAFs consists of a single polypeptide chain and has no subunit structures. These three purified GAFs had almost the same growth-stimulating effect on glial cells in vitro, and the half-maximal dose was around 10(-11) M. Concanavalin A staining and glycopeptide N-glycosidase treatment of GAFs indicated that an asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chain(s) was attached to these three kinds of GAFs. Microsequencing of each GAF revealed a single amino-terminal sequence with no significant homology to any known protein, and the amino-terminal sequence of the 30-kDa GAF included that of the 29-kDa GAF. GAFs also stimulated the cell growth of oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte progenitor cells, BALB/c3T3 fibroblasts, and PC-12 cells but not that of human umbilical vein endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1560218046,"In a Jurkat cell model of T-cell activation an interleukin-2 promoter/reporter gene construct was activated by antigen receptor agonism in combination with the lymphokine interleukin-1. Antigen receptor signals could be mimicked by suboptimal activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol esters in combination with calcium mobilization by an ionophore. In cotransfection experiments, oncogenic rats obviated the need for PKC stimulation but did not replace either the calcium signal or interleukin-1. Activated ras expression also replaced the requirement for PKC stimulation in activation of the T-cell transcription factor NF-AT. A dominant inhibitory ras mutant specifically blocked antigen receptor agonism, indicating that ras activity is required for antigen receptor signaling. In addition, an inhibitor of PKC blocked both activated ras and phorbol ester stimulation, suggesting a role for ras upstream of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1532143214,"The possibility that a 7-day period of ethanol exposure could regulate expression of specific GTP-binding regulatory proteins was investigated in two distinct brain regions from two different lines of ethanol-sensitive mice. Following ethanol treatment, plasma membranes were prepared from cerebellum and pons of short and long sleep mice. Studies of membranes were performed to assess hormone-sensitive adenylylcyclase activity and to quantify expression of G-protein subunits. Immunoblot analysis showed that levels of Gi alpha(1) and Gi alpha(2) were markedly increased in cerebellar and pons membranes from ethanol-exposed mice compared to controls. Treatment of short sleep mice with ethanol enhanced ADP-ribosylation of both a 41- and a 39-40 kDa protein catalyzed by pertussis toxin. Ethanol did not alter expression of Gs alpha as assessed by immunoblot analysis, cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation, or by the ability of detergent extracted Gs alpha to reconstitute a functional adenylylcyclase in membranes from S49 cyc- murine lymphoma cells, a cell line which genetically lacks Gs alpha. Moreover, ethanol exposure did not influence levels of G(o) alpha or G beta 35-36 in either cerebellar or pons membranes. Cerebellar and pons membranes from ethanol-exposed short sleep mice demonstrated significantly less adenylylcyclase activity following stimulation with GTP, GTP gamma S, AlF, forskolin, and stimulatory ligands for three distinct receptors which couple to Gs alpha. Pretreatment of membranes with pertussis toxin reversed the ethanol-induced inhibition in adenylylcyclase activity. These observations were not limited to one line of mice but were also documented in a second line of ethanol-sensitive mice (e.g. long sleep). We conclude that ethanol exposure enhances expression of Gi alpha(1) and Gi alpha(2) in ethanol-sensitive mice, and is associated with decreased adenylylcyclase activity. Enhanced expression of Gi alpha(1) and Gi alpha(2) may contribute to impaired signal transduction in the central nervous system, and reduce the efficacy of neurotransmitters which signal through the adenylylcyclase system."
https://openalex.org/W1605952099,"Previously, we have reported a novel proliferative action of pancreatic group I phospholipase A2 (PLA2-I) via a specific binding site in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, and chondrocytes. In this study, we characterized the PLA2-I specific binding site in osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1 cells) with an equilibrium binding constant (Kd) value of 1.13 nM and maximum binding capacity of 40.1 fmol/10(6) cells. PLA2-I stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in a concentration-dependent manner in MC3T3-E1 cells, and its EC50 value was similar to the Kd value for PLA2-I binding. This effect of PLA2-I was type-specific and did not depend on its hydrolytic activity. PLA2-I increased the activity of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase (PES), and PLA2-I-stimulated PGE2 synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Northern blot analysis showed the increase in both type-1 and type-2 PES mRNAs. These findings indicated that PLA2-I stimulated PGE2 synthesis by induction of PES via a specific binding site in osteoblastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1557773400,"Terminases are enzymes common to complex double-stranded DNA viruses and are required for packaging of the viral genome into a preformed capsid. The overexpression of bacteriophage lambda-terminase in Escherichia coli has been previously reported (Chow, S., Daub, E., and Murialdo, H. (1987) Gene (Amst.) 60, 277-289), and we present here a purification scheme for the isolation of milligram quantities of protein which is homogenous ( > 97%) as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. lambda-Terminase is composed of the gene products of Nu1 and A. Using N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified protein, we have determined a subunit stoichiometry of 2 gpNu1 polypeptides/gpA molecule in terminase holoenzyme. The circular dichroism spectrum for the purified holoenzyme has been obtained and is consistent with a protein complex composed primarily of alpha-helical structure. The endonucleolytic activity of the enzyme (the TER reaction) has been optimized with respect to pH, salt, and polyamine concentrations. Divalent metal ion is strictly required for the reaction and may be satisfied by either magnesium or manganese, but not by any of the other metals examined. E. coli integration host factor in amounts stoichiometric with the DNA substrate stimulates the TER reaction, but only when the enzyme is present in limiting amounts. Increasing the enzyme/DNA ratio attenuates the observed stimulation by integration host factor. A kinetic analysis of the TER reaction suggests that the assembly of multiple terminase promoters is required for efficient cleavage of viral DNA and that this reaction appears to be stoichiometric, rather than catalytic under the reaction conditions utilized. The implications of these results with respect to the packaging of viral DNA by terminase enzymes are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1483283945,"In our previous publication (Shaw, G.-C., and Fulco, A. J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5515-5526), we reported that Bm3R1, a protein encoded in an open reading frame just upstream from the cytochrome P450BM-3 gene, is a repressor critically involved in the barbiturate-inducible expression of this gene in Bacillus megaterium. We now describe the purification of the Bm3R1 protein from an overproducing Escherichia coli strain harboring a bm3R1 gene-carrying plasmid and report the effect of barbiturate inducers on the interaction of Bm3R1 with a fragment of B. megaterium DNA containing the bicistronic operator and promoter sequences. Gel filtration analysis revealed that, under our experimental conditions, most of the Bm3R1 protein exists in highly aggregated forms. Gel mobility shift assays showed that Bm3R1 protein bound specifically to a segment of DNA containing the promoter-operator region of the bm3R1 gene while DNase I footprinting experiments established that Bm3R1 protected a region of DNA that covers and flanks the palindromic operator sequence. The interaction between Bm3R1 repressor and its operator, in vitro, was strongly inhibited by the addition of 2 mM pentobarbital or 2 mM methohexital (strong in vivo inducers of P450BM-3) but not by the same concentration of phenobarbital (a relatively weak inducer) or by mephobarbital (a non-inducer). A detailed comparison of pentobarbital and methohexital at concentrations lower than 2 mM indicated that methohexital was 5-10 times more effective as an inhibitor of Bm3R1 binding in vitro, as compared with its 7-fold greater inducer potency in vivo. The observation that the in vitro inhibition effects of barbiturates on the interaction of Bm3R1 repressor and its operator correlate strongly with their in vivo potency as inducers of cytochrome P450BM-3 suggests a mechanism for the induction process. It seems plausible that the barbiturate inducers might bear a conformational resemblance to and mimic the mode of action of an as yet unidentified endogenous inducer(s) in B. megaterium that functions by releasing the binding of Bm3R1 repressor from its operator site."
https://openalex.org/W1527200314,"Plastins are a family of human actin-binding proteins (isoforms) which are abundantly expressed in all normal replicating mammalian cells. One isoform, L-plastin, is constitutively expressed at high levels in hemopoietic cell types while T-plastin is constitutively expressed in all non-hemopoietic cells of solid tissues that have replicative potential (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, melanocytes, etc.). L-plastin is, however, constitutively synthesized in many types of malignant human cells of solid tissues suggesting that its expression is induced during tumorigenesis. The frequency of L-plastin induction in some cancers of the steroid-regulated female reproductive tract (breast, ovary, uterus, and placenta) appears to be especially high (79% in a limited survey). To learn the mechanism of L-plastin gene activation accompanying tumorigenesis, we have begun to characterize the promoter and regulatory elements of the L-plastin gene. Transcription initiation from this promoter was found to occur at multiple sites and as near as 10 base pairs from the 3'-side of the TATAAA box. The promoter and its flanking DNA were cloned and sequenced to identify potential regulatory elements that participate in the induction of the L-plastin gene in neoplastic cells. Examination of upstream sequences revealed the existence of two potential progesterone, one potential estrogen, and four potential Ets-1 responsive elements flanking the promoter. A 315-base pair fragment spanning the TATAAA box and a potential Sp1-binding site exhibited maximum promoter activity using CAT as a reporter while longer promoter fragments extending into upstream flanking sequences spanning the hormone receptor-response elements exhibited reduced promoter activity. An expression vector, pHLPPr-1-neo, was constructed using a 5.1-kilobase pair EcoRI-HindIII fragment of the L-plastin gene that contained the potential upstream regulatory elements, the TATAAA box, and part of the first exon. This promoter could direct the constitutive expression of the reporter beta-galactosidase at high frequency in transfected colonies of transformed cells that express L-plastin constitutively; by contrast, this promoter was virtually inactive in transfected colonies of normal fibroblasts and it exhibited a low frequency of constitutive activation in transfected colonies of in vitro SV40-transformed fibroblasts which did not exhibit L-plastin expression. The utility of this recombinant promoter in determining the mechanism(s) that leads to activation of the L-plastin gene in tumor cells is discussed. The potential significance of regulation of the L-plastin gene by reproductive hormones in cancers arising in hormone-responsive tissues is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1598210890,"Recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to more than 95% homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation and agarose-ATP column chromatography. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 21-28 mumol/mg, as assessed by the generation of 5-hydro(pero)xyeicosatetraenoic acid. The iron content was analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry for six preparations of the enzyme. The average value of the iron content was 0.86 mol/mol (iron/protein) with a range of 0.74-1.15 mol/mol. All lipoxygenases that have been sequenced contain 6 conserved histidine residues. Mutants of 5-lipoxygenase, with substitutions of these 6 conserved histidines, were purified and analyzed. Mutants H372Q and H550Q had no detectable enzyme activity and were also practically devoid of iron. Three mutants regarding His367 (H367Q, H367N, and H367S) were all inactive but had partial iron contents (0.5, 0.2, and 0.5 mol/mol, respectively). Finally, the mutated proteins H362Q, H390Q, and H399Q displayed reduced enzyme activity but contained similar amounts of iron as non-mutated 5-lipoxygenase. We conclude that histidines 372 and 550 constitute two of the iron ligands in 5-lipoxygenase. Also His367 is necessary for the enzyme activity, but this residue is not crucial for binding of iron."
https://openalex.org/W1487896073,"Collagen types IX, XII, and XIV are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved region comprising the most C-terminal triple helical domain (COL1, approximately 100 residues/chain) and 2 cysteines separated by 4 amino acid residues at the junction between this COL1 domain and the C-terminal non-triple helical domain (NC1). In order to better understand the functions of this conserved domain, we have constructed a recombinant minigene, comprising the sequence coding for an unrelated signal peptide and for the COL1 and NC1 domains of type XII collagen. This construct was placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and transfected into HeLa cells. The cells expressed the transfected minigene and the secreted chain, called alpha 1 (mini XII), could be detected by immunotransfer with an anti-peptide antibody recognizing an epitope found in the NC1 domain. Under conditions preventing the hydroxylation of prolyl residues (absence of ascorbate or presence of alpha alpha'-dipyridyl), interchain disulfide bridges did not form, while in the presence of ascorbate, disulfide-bonded (alpha 1 (mini XII))3 molecules were secreted. The collagenous nature and triple helical conformation of the trimeric molecule were ascertained by the differential resistances of the COL1 and NC1 domains to trypsin and collagenase digestions, respectively. Our data demonstrate that the NC1 and COL1 domains of type XII collagen contain the information necessary for trimer formation and that, contrary to the fibrillar collagen types, posttranslational modification of the triple helical domain is essential for assembly and disulfide bonding of the chains."
https://openalex.org/W1580606703,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulates and thyroid hormone (T3) inhibits transcription of the thyrotropin beta-subunit gene (TSH-beta). The first exon contains DNA sequences necessary for both responses and binds both AP-1 and thyroid hormone receptor (T3R). T3 did not inhibit TSH-beta gene expression in a T3R-deficient cell line. Transfection of a T3R expression vector, however, resulted in a 70% inhibition of expression by T3, which was abolished by cotransfection of c-jun and c-fos expression vectors. Mutations surrounding the transcription initiation site and DNA binding studies demonstrate both a functional and structural interaction between c-jun and T3R. Thus, TRH, acting through AP-1, may alter the set point and magnitude of thyroid hormone negative feedback of the TSH-beta gene through an interaction between AP-1 and T3R. Other regulatory pathways acting through AP-1 may alter thyroid hormone action in man."
https://openalex.org/W1622527135,"The gene-specific formation and repair of interstrand cross-links (ICL) were measured in the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in hamster cells. Cells were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, nitrogen mustard and cisplatin, and the frequency of cross-links was quantified in the active gene and in a downstream, inactive region. About 5% of total lesions induced by these agents were ICL. Whereas the frequencies of cross-links formed were similar in the gene and in the noncoding region after cisplatin treatment, there were more nitrogen mustard-induced cross-links in the inactive region than in the active gene. At low levels of cross-linking, we found preferential DNA repair in the active gene as compared to the inactive region. At higher levels of cross-linking, there was no difference in repair rates between the gene and the noncoding region due to an increase in the repair efficiency in the inactive DNA. Implications of fine structural organization of cross-link repair are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1585897828,"Purification and sequencing of proteins from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles have provided a framework for the study of SR function. Included among the SR proteins so far investigated are a collection of intralumenal proteins that stain blue with the protein dye Stains-All in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. A single prominent blue staining SR protein of apparent M(r) = 90,000 (Band VII), however, has remained uncharacterized. In the work described here, purification of Band VII from dog cardiac SR vesicles, along with amino acid sequencing and cDNA cloning, identified this protein as calnexin, a homologue of calreticulin recently described in dog pancreatic microsomes. Using ryanodine-mediated calcium oxalate loading of SR vesicles followed by density gradient centrifugation, we have shown that calnexin is a bona fide SR protein and an integral constituent of both junctional and free SR vesicles. Calnexin was found to be a substrate for casein kinase II and was phosphorylated at two distinct sites localized to the carboxyl- and amino-terminal ends of the molecule. Enrichment of calnexin in cardiac SR vesicles indicates a role for calnexin involving the specialized function of the SR membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1719108898,"Interaction of cells with both native and reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL) containing apolipoprotein (apo) A-I mediates efflux of cellular cholesterol. To characterize structural requirements for this activity in apoA-I, six different genetic apoA-I variants and the corresponding normal allele products were isolated from heterozygous carriers, reconstituted with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) into discoidal HDL and compared with regard to their ability to release intracellular cholesterol from murine adipocytes and peritoneal macrophages. In previous studies we determined the amino acid changes of these variants: Pro3-->Arg, Pro4-->Arg, Lys107-->0, Lys107-->Met, Pro165-->Arg, and Glu198-->Lys (von Eckardstein, A., Funke, H., Walter, M., Altland, K., Benninghoven, A., and Assmann, G. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8610-8617) and demonstrated that all apoA-I variants except apoA-I(Lys107-->0) form discoidal HDL particles with phosphatidylcholine analogues indistinguishable from normal apoA-I (Jonas, A., von Eckardstein, A., Kezdy, K. E., Steinmetz, A., and Assmann, G. (1991) J. Lipid Res. 32, 95-106). In the present study, all apoA-I.DMPC complexes except those containing apoA-I(Pro165-->Arg) promoted cholesterol efflux as effectively as those containing normal apoA-I. Cholesterol efflux from adipocytes obtained after 180 min of incubation with apoA-I(Pro165-->Arg).DMPC complexes was decreased by 30% although this variant was bound to adipocytes with normal affinity. By contrast, apoA-I(Lys107-->Met).DMPC complexes were decreased in their binding affinity compared to normal apoA-I.DMPC complexes but normally promoted cholesterol efflux. Incubation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with apoA-I(Pro165-->Arg).DMPC complexes did also result in a 30% decreased efflux of radiolabeled cholesterol if compared to rHDL with the normal allele product from the same donor. Together the observations suggest that the substitution of proline at residue 165 interferes with the formation of a structural domain in apoA-I that is crucial for cellular cholesterol efflux stimulation. Furthermore, our results suggest that binding of HDL to adipocytes and cholesterol efflux promotion by HDL requires different structural domains."
https://openalex.org/W1941103803,"The aging of IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts in culture is accompanied by a 5-7 fold decrease in the level of thymidine kinase (TK) mRNA and TK activity (Chang, Z. F., and Chen, K. Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11431-11435). We have employed a gel mobility shift analysis to investigate the molecular basis of the age-dependent attenuation of TK gene expression. Several cis-elements including two inverted CCAAT boxes, located at base pairs (bp) -36 and -67, and GC-rich Sp1 binding sites have been identified in the TK promoter. A 28-bp (-91 to -64) fragment containing the distal inverted CCAAT element was excised from the TK promoter to examine possible differences in nuclear protein binding between young and old IMR-90 cells. A prominent DNA-protein complex was identified in serum-stimulated young cells by a gel mobility shift assay. Competition analysis indicated that the binding was highly specific. The nuclear protein responsible for the complex formation was named CBP/tk (CCAAT Binding Protein for TK gene) since methylation interference assay showed that the inverted CCAAT box was involved in binding. The appearance of the CBP/tk-28-bp complex in IMR-90 cells was (i) serum-dependent, becoming prominent 12-24 h after serum stimulation, and (ii) age-dependent, prominent only in young but not in old IMR-90 cells. Similar serum- and age-dependent complex formations were also observed using a 67-bp fragment (-63 to +4) containing the proximal CCAAT element and a TATA box. In contrast, the binding activities for the Sp1 sequence were the same in young and old cells and appeared to be serum-independent. CBP/tk binding activity in nuclear extracts was abolished by heat (60 degrees C, 5 min) or treatment with proteinase K (0.1 microgram/ml) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.005%), but not by Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100. Treatment of nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase or lectins (concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin) did not affect the binding activity. Metal chelators such as 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline (0.5 mM) inhibited the CBP/tk binding activity. Cycloheximide added to the serum-stimulated cultures at an early or mid-G1 phase inhibited the CBP/tk binding activity. The half-life of the serum-induced CBP/tk binding activity was estimated to be less than 1 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1588077437,"Proximal regulatory element B (PRE-B), located from positions -318 to -284 in the alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter, stimulated expression from an otherwise weak alpha-MHC promoter fragment in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes but not in the C2C12 myogenic cell line. PRE-B interacted with alpha-MHC binding factor 2 (BF-2), a protein found in nuclear extracts from several neonatal rat tissues and cell types including cardiomyocytes. BF-2 DNA binding activity was greatly reduced in adult versus neonatal tissues. Methylation interference footprints indicated that BF-2 bound to an element that included an E-box consensus sequence. Site-directed mutations in the BF-2-binding site, that abolish BF-2 binding, reduced expression from the full-length alpha-MHC promoter by 70%. A BF-2-like protein interacts within the HF-1a element of the myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2) promoter suggesting that one of the proteins that regulates the alpha-MHC and MLC-2 genes is identical or closely related. Analysis of binding by competition gel shift experiments indicated that both BF-2 and HF-1a are E-box-binding proteins. The alpha-MHC and MLC-2 genes encode contractile proteins which are precursors of myosin. Regulation by the same transcription factor might indicate that the expression of alpha-MHC and MLC-2 is coordinately controlled."
https://openalex.org/W1497663490,"Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trimeric molecule synthesized by a variety of normal and transformed cells and secreted into the extracellular matrix. A number of studies have shown TSP to be intimately involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. These include the findings that TSP is a mitogen-inducible immediate-early response gene; it localizes to areas of cellular proliferation in the developing mouse embryo; it augments the proliferative response to epidermal growth factor; anti-TSP monoclonal antibodies block cell proliferation; and TSP levels correlate directly with the growth and invasive phenotype and inversely with the degree of differentiation of squamous carcinoma cells. To determine whether TSP could behave as an oncogene, conferring serum and anchorage independence, NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with a TSP expression vector. Clones producing high levels of TSP displayed enhanced viability and a proliferative advantage in serum-reduced media. Moreover, this growth advantage could be specifically negated by treatment of the transfected cells with anti-TSP monoclonal antibodies. While the TSP overexpressing clones were capable of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, surprisingly, they were incapable of forming tumors in nude mice, possibly due to the in vivo antiangiogenic activity of TSP. Regardless, these studies demonstrate that overexpression of thrombospondin, a constituent of the extracellular matrix, results in serum and anchorage independent growth, attributes normally associated with the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1555903964,"Abstract Structural transitions have been studied on the pathway for urea denaturation of rhodanese. Unlike guanidinium hydrochloride, urea gives no visible precipitation. Increasing urea concentrations cause a transition in which the enzyme activity is completely lost by 4.5 M urea, and there is a shift of the intrinsic fluorescence maximum from 335 nm for the native enzyme to 350 nm. There is a maximum exposure of organized hydrophobic surfaces at 4.5 M urea as reported by the fluorescence of 1,1'-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5'-disulfonic acid. Above 4.5 M urea, this probe reports the progressive loss of organized hydrophobic surfaces. The polarization of the intrinsic fluorescence falls with increasing urea concentrations in a complex transition showing that rhodanese flexibility increases in at least two phases. Rhodanese becomes increasingly susceptible to digestion by subtilisin between 3.5 and 4.5 M urea, giving rise to large fragments. At urea concentrations > 5 M, rhodanese is completely digested. There is a small increase in the rate of sulfhydryl accessibility between 3.5 and 4.5 M urea, but there is a large increase in the sulfhydryl accessibility above 4.5 M urea. Dimethyl suberimidate cross-linking shows the presence of associated species in 3-5 M urea, but there are few cross-linkable species at lower or higher urea concentrations. These results are consistent with a model in which urea unfolding of rhodanese is associated with the initial production of a species having organized regions of structure with exposed hydrophobic surfaces separated by flexible elements."
https://openalex.org/W1581720380,"C4b-binding protein (C4BP) is a plasma glycoprotein that contains independent binding sites for complement component C4b and anticoagulant vitamin K-dependent protein S. C4BP is composed of seven alpha-chains (70 kDa) and one beta-chain (45 kDa) joined by disulfide bonds. In addition to non-repeat regions, the alpha- and beta-chains contain eight and three tandemly arranged modules, respectively, designated short consensus repeats (SCRs). C4b binds to the alpha-chains while it has been suggested, though not conclusively shown, that the beta-chain binds protein S. A truncated recombinant beta-chain composed of the three SCRs was expressed as a fusion protein with an epitope for a calcium-dependent monoclonal antibody (HPC4) in a procaryotic expression system. A signal peptide from the pelB gene of Erwinia carotovora directed expression to the medium from which the recombinant protein was purified using a HPC4 affinity column. On unreduced polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, the recombinant protein demonstrated two closely spaced bands (M(r) = 19,000 and 20,000), whereas after reduction a broad band with an apparent molecular weight of 25,000 was obtained. On 125I-protein S ligand blotting, only one of the unreduced bands was found to bind protein S. The protein corresponding to this band bound protein S with almost as high affinity as intact C4BP, and it completely inhibited binding of protein S to intact C4BP. After reduction, the protein S binding ability was lost. The multiple carbohydrate side chains present in the native beta-chain of C4BP were apparently not required for protein S binding, as the recombinant beta-chain was not glycosylated. These results demonstrate that the protein S binding site of C4BP is contained within the three SCR modules of its beta-chain."
https://openalex.org/W1656824704,"Abstract Protamines and transition proteins are highly basic sperm-specific nuclear proteins that serve to compact the DNA within the condensing spermatid nucleus. It has been proposed that the genes for protamine P1 and P2 and transition protein 2 may be clustered at a single loci. This may have marked implications for their evolution and coordinate developmental regulation. The cloning of a contiguous segment encompassing this region would directly address these issues. We have utilized a cloned segment of the human protamine P1 gene to isolate a human cosmid clone which contains the genes for protamines P1 and P2 and transition protein TP2. Sequence and hybridization analysis of this cosmid showed that the TP2 gene resided 3' of the P2 gene at a distance of approximately 7 kilobases (kb). This establishes the order of this gene cluster within a 13-kb region of 16p13.13-16p13.2 to be P1-->P2-->TP2. Similar to their spatial order, comparative computer-assisted sequence analysis predicts an identical relative rank order of emergence. Accordingly we propose that this gene cluster may have arisen from the P1 gene through a series of gene duplication events."
https://openalex.org/W1503969832,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to prepare two new mutant recA proteins, one in which histidine 97 has been replaced by alanine, and another in which lysine 248 has been replaced by alanine. Although these mutant proteins were originally designed from different considerations, they turned out to have remarkably similar properties. Both the [H97A]recA protein and the [K248A]recA protein bind poorly to single-stranded DNA, have no single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity, and do not promote renaturation of complementary single-stranded DNA molecules or the ATP-dependent three-strand exchange reaction. Furthermore, both mutant proteins are defective in Mg(2+)-induced helical filament formation. To account for these results, we propose that the mutation of either histidine 97 or lysine 248 alters subunit interactions between recA monomers and that this leads to the loss of cooperative single-stranded DNA binding and DNA pairing activities. This proposal is consistent with the recently determined x-ray structure of the recA protein, which shows that although histidine 97 and lysine 248 are distant from one another in the monomer structure, these two residues are on the opposing complementary faces of the recA subunit and pack against each other at the interface between adjacent recA monomers in the helical filament (Story, R. M., Weber, I. T., and Steitz, T. A. (1992) Nature 355, 318-325)."

Post-translational modifications of the protein involve gamma-carboxylation of specific glutamic acid residues, beta-hydroxylation of one aspartic acid residue, and N- and O-linked glycosylation. Even though it is known that gamma-carboxylation is instrumental in regulating biological activity, the role of glycosylation in the function and properties of factor X has not been previously investigated. We utilized lectin binding and glycosidase treatment to investigate the functional role of carbohydrates on the activation peptide of factor X. Sambucus nigra agglutinin, a lectin that binds to sialic acid terminally linked alpha(2-6) to galactose or N-acetyl-galactosamine inhibits activation of human factor X in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of activation was observed for both intrinsic (factor IXa/VIIIa) and extrinsic (factor VIIa/tissue factor) pathway complexes. In accordance with this, selective removal of sialic acid residues on the activation peptide of factor X by neuraminidase also results in a drastic reduction of activation of the zymogen by these complexes. Corresponding reduction of activity in classical clotting assays (activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time) also agrees with this observation. These results suggest a possible role of N-linked carbohydrates in the activation of factor X."
https://openalex.org/W1496403573,"Transcription of vaccinia virus early genes in vitro requires the virally encoded RNA polymerase and early transcription factor, VETF. VETF is a promoter-binding protein with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. We have investigated the functional role of VETF in transcription activation by analyzing the interaction between the RNA polymerase and promoter DNA. Using a gel shift assay, a novel protein-DNA complex was detected that required both RNA polymerase and VETF. The complex was suggested to be a transcription initiation complex by its ability to incorporate 32P-labeled nucleotides in combinations compatible with synthesis of a short RNA chain. Competition binding studies indicated that the RNA polymerase associated specifically with a viral early promoter. These experiments demonstrate that VETF activates transcription by directly recruiting the RNA polymerase to the promoter. Sedimentation analysis showed that VETF and RNA polymerase did not form a stable complex unless promoter DNA was present, indicating that protein-protein contacts are not the sole basis for initiation complex assembly. DNase I cleavage and methylation interference analyses revealed a hyperreactive site in the center of the promoter. Radiolabeling of RNA in the RNA polymerase-promoter complex did not occur when AMP-PNP (adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate) was substituted for ATP, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required for the initiation of transcription. A model is proposed to account for these findings."
https://openalex.org/W1503890837,"The transactivation potential of several isoforms of the lymphoid-specific transcription factor Oct2 has been analyzed using in vitro transcription. Oct2 can stimulate transcription in B-cell nuclear extracts and in HeLa nuclear extracts depleted of the ubiquitous factor Oct1 by wheat germ lectin affinity chromatography. Activity is observed from both natural and synthetic promoters containing single or multiple copies of the octamer motif ATGCAAAT. Multimerization of this motif does not result in a synergistic transcriptional stimulation, but rather leads to a linear increase in activity. To analyze the various Oct2 isoforms, they were overexpressed in HeLa cells using recombinant vaccinia virus. Although all the isoforms bind similarly to the octamer sequence, they show clear differences in their ability to transactivate transcription. This ranges from a 2-fold stimulation for Oct2.3 to the almost 20-fold effect of the most potent variant Oct2.5. In general the relative activity of the isoforms in vitro reflects that observed in vivo in cotransfection experiments. Interestingly the ubiquitous factor Oct1 is also an efficient activator of transcription in vitro, but only from promoters with multiple octamer motifs. Sarkosyl inhibition studies suggest that both Oct1 and Oct2 function in vitro by stabilizing preinitiation complexes without affecting the reinitiation rate of RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W1537959232,"Changes in the composition of membrane lipids in a strictly anaerobic, facultative acidophilic eubacterium, Sarcina ventriculi, were studied in response to various forms of environmental stress. Changes in lipid composition and structure occurred in response to changes in environmental pH. At neutral pH, the predominant membrane fatty acids ranged in chain length from C14 to C18. However, when cells were grown at pH 3.0, a family of unique very long chain fatty acids containing 32-36 carbon atoms was synthesized and accounted for 50% of the total membrane fatty acids. These acids were identified as very long chain alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids ranging in length from 28 to 36 carbons by electron impact mass spectrometry of methyl and (perdeuterio) methyl ester derivatives. These methyl esters all bore a vicinal dimethyl group toward the center of the chain. The assignment of the structures was confirmed by isolating one of the very long chain unusual fatty acids as the ester form after methanolysis and performing further analyses including 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Coupling this information with the data from gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, the exact structure was confirmed as alpha,omega-15,16-dimethyltricotanedioate dimethyl ester. Addition of alcohols, either metabolic (0.25 M ethanol) or nonmetabolic (0.05 M butanol) to cells grown at pH 7.0, or thermal stress (growth temperature at pH 7.0 was raised from 37 to 45 or 55 degrees C) also resulted in the synthesis of these very long chain fatty acids. Synthesis of these very long chain alpha,omega-dicarboxylic acids was reversed by reducing the temperature back to 37 degrees C. S. ventriculi is also unusual in that the membrane components are not the usual phospholipid components but appear to be predominantly glycolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1530736659,"Regulation of transcriptional initiation of the Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon occurs at the divergent promoter region lying between the structural genes (merTPCAD) and a regulatory gene (merR). During repression, both promoters are negatively regulated by MerR bound to a dyadic operator located between the -10 and -35 hexamers of PTPCAD. Upon Hg(II) induction, MerR activates transcription only from PTPCAD and continues to repress transcription from PR. Using in vivo dimethyl sulfate and KMnO4 footprinting of the merOP region of strains carrying wild-type MerR or MerR mutants, we have dissected the steps in MerR-mediated positive and negative regulation of the divergent mer promoters. The greater sensitivity of primer extension footprinting allowed the resolution of details previously undetectable in vivo. Two MerR mutants unable to bind merOP DNA allow RNA polymerase to form an open complex preferentially at PR. The intensity of the PR open complex is considerably less than that which occurs upon MerR-Hg(II) activation of PTPCAD and considerably greater than that which occurs at PTPCAD when MerR is deleted; this is the first in vivo estimate of the relative strengths of these two promoters. Although retaining the wild-type capacity to sequester RNA polymerase in the closed complex, the four MerR mutants defective in Hg(II) binding do not distort the dyad DNA or foster open complex formation when the inducer is added. Two activation-defective MerR mutants foster closed complex formation as well as wild-type, but they do not distort the dyad DNA or foster open complex formation when the inducer is added, although they are also able to bind Hg(II). Two semiconstitutive inducible MerR mutants differ from each other in that one (which lies nearer the COOH terminus) does distort the dyad center upon Hg(II) induction, whereas the other (which lies in near the center of merR) exhibits no dyad distortion upon induction. Paradoxically, despite their relatively strong semiconstitutive expression of mer-lac transcriptional fusions, neither of these mutants has a detectable open complex in the absence of added Hg(II)."
https://openalex.org/W1493809608,"The transcriptional regulatory protein Leu3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was enriched approximately 70-fold above wild type level in yeast cells carrying a pGAL1-LEU3 expression vector. Sustained overproduction of Leu3 following induction by galactose required elevated intracellular levels of alpha-isopropylmalate, a leucine pathway intermediate known to act as transcriptional co-activator. Starting with galactose-induced cells, the Leu3 protein was purified about 3,500-fold (i.e. 245,000-fold over wild type level) by a procedure that included treatment of the cell-free extract with polyethylenimine, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, heat treatment, and DNA affinity chromatography. Highly purified preparations still showed two protein bands when subjected to polyacrylamide electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Their apparent molecular masses were about 104,000 and 110,000 kDa. The smaller of these values was very close to the maximum molecular weight obtained previously for Leu3 protein translated in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. (The molecular weight deduced from the open reading frame of the LEU3 gene is 100,162.) Both protein bands reacted with antibodies raised against different portions of the Leu3 molecule and were, therefore, likely to represent two forms of Leu3. Treatment with calf intestinal phosphatase quantitatively converted the slower moving band into the faster moving one. Conversion was prevented by inorganic phosphate, a phosphatase inhibitor. These experiments showed that the two bands very likely correspond to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of Leu3. Phosphorylation did not appear to affect the DNA binding function of Leu3, but (indirect) effects on the activation function or effects on the modulation by alpha-isopropylmalate have not been ruled out. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to estimate the apparent dissociation constants of the two specific Leu3-DNA complexes routinely seen in these assays. The values obtained were 1.1 and 2.6 nM. Finally, using size exclusion chromatography, native Leu3 protein was shown to have dimeric structure, irrespective of the state of phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1502683866,"Rabbit neutral endopeptidase-24.11 is a type II transmembrane protein with a 27-amino acid residue positively charged NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a 23-amino acid residue hydrophobic signal peptide/membrane anchor domain, and a large catalytic COOH-terminal domain exposed on the exoplasmic side of the membrane. In order to study the mechanism of membrane anchoring of neutral endopeptidase-24.11, we created mutants in which the cytoplasmic tail was deleted. Expression of these mutants in COS-1 cells resulted in the secretion of approximately 10-20% of the protein into the culture medium, due possibly to the cleavage of part or all of the signal peptide/membrane anchor domain by the rough endoplasmic reticulum signal peptidase. In a second set of mutants, a hydrophilic sequence (GSQNS) was inserted midway in the signal peptide/membrane anchor domain of neutral endopeptidase-24.11. When this hydrophilic sequence was introduced into the full-length neutral endopeptidase-24.11, approximately 20% of the enzyme activity was recovered in the culture medium. This proportion increased to 93% when the cytosolic tail was deleted. Sequencing of the [3H]tyrosine- or [3H]isoleucine-labeled secreted protein indicated that proteolysis, possibly by signal peptidase, occurred on the COOH-terminal side of the signal peptide/membrane anchor domain. We conclude that the efficient cleavage of the signal peptide/membrane anchor domain and secretion of the protein require both the deletion of the cytosolic domain and the presence of a hydrophilic sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1554026413,"Transcription of the Tn21 mercury resistance (mer) operon is regulated by MerR which represses and activates the mer structural genes (merTPCAD) in the absence and presence of Hg(II), respectively. The promoter for the structural genes (PTPCAD) is divergently overlapped with the promoter for the regulatory gene (PR), and a dyadic operator lies between the -10 and -35 hexamers of PTPCAD. Using in vivo dimethyl sulfate and KMnO4 footprinting of mutant mer operator-promoter (merOP) DNA to observe MerR and RNA polymerase-mediated interactions with the merOP region, we have identified three distinct domains within the palindromic mer operator. Dyad domain I consists of the outermost bases on the left arm of the operator palindrome whose alteration causes a shift, but apparently not a major loss, in occupancy by MerR, and no decrease in RNA polymerase occupancy. Mutants in dyad domain I are semiconstitutive but support additional Hg(II)-induced open complex formation at PTPCAD. Dyad domain II consists of the four highly conserved inner bases ( ... GTAC ... GTAC ... ) of the seven-base interrupted dyad, alteration of which severely modifies both MerR and RNA polymerase contacts in the promoter region. Mutants in domain II generally allow constitutive open complex formation at PR. One unusual mutant of this group retains most of the wild-type dyad's ability to repress both promoters but is unable to support activation at PTPCAD in response to Hg(II), indicating that MerR undergoes a conformational change and that the required base contacts for activation are different than those for repression. Dyad domain III is tentatively defined by a mutant in the outermost base of the right palindrome arm which is unaffected in either MerR or RNA polymerase occupancy, however, a second lesion within the PTPCAD -10 hexamer of this mutant limits effective open complex formation. Other mutations lying solely within the -10 RNA polymerase recognition hexamer of PTPCAD are similarly competent in both MerR and RNA polymerase binding, but inadequate for open complex formation. One such mutant also affects the overlapping -10 hexamer of PR and results in reduced occupancy by both MerR and RNA polymerase, likely as a result of inefficient transcriptional initiation of merR mRNA. Finally, mutations affecting the -35 hexamer of PTPCAD bind MerR but not RNA polymerase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1514918661,"Monobutyrin (1-butyrylglycerol) is a simple lipid secreted by adipocytes that stimulates both angiogenesis and vasodilation of microvascular beds. While monobutyrin production is increased during lipolysis, little is known about the biosynthetic pathway of this short chain monoacylglycerol. We show here that diacylglycerol, an intermediate in the lipolytic pathway, can stimulate monobutyrin synthesis from an adipocyte particulate fraction and does so by acting as a substrate. The biosynthetic route involves the acylation of diacylglycerol with butyryl-CoA to form a transient triacylglycerol intermediate. This intermediate is then hydrolyzed by a lipase(s) with specificity for long chain fatty acyl groups to form monobutyrin. Based on this information, a novel pathway for the synthesis of monobutyrin is proposed. Preliminary characterization of these enzymatic activities with respect to their cell-type specificity indicates that the acyltransferase activity is found in several cell types, albeit at lower levels than in adipocytes. The lipase activity appears to be two distinct steps, with both steps being adipocyte differentiation-dependent. These results indicate the likely biochemical basis for the restriction of monobutyrin synthesis to fat cells and also suggests a molecular basis for the close linkage between lipolysis, monobutyrin synthesis, and vasodilation."
https://openalex.org/W1534060890,"Class II protein carboxyl methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.77) are known to exist predominantly in a soluble form in all cells studied so far. These enzymes have been purified to homogeneity from the cytosols of many mammalian tissues but not from membranes. We describe here the purification to apparent homogeneity of a membrane-associated protein carboxyl methyltransferase from the brush border membrane of rat kidney. The enzyme was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on Superdex 75 and Mono-Q and by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and consists of a single 27,300 polypeptide. The purified enzyme recognizes exogenous substrate proteins such as ovalbumin and gamma-globulins as well as synthetic peptides containing a L-isoaspartyl residue but not a synthetic peptide containing a farnesylated C-terminal cysteine (S-farnesyl-LARYKC). The Km for S-adenosyl-L-methionine with ovalbumin as the substrate is 1.5 microM and the purified enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (Ki = 0.3 microM). Peptide map obtained after Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion of brush border membrane protein carboxyl methyltransferase showed a fragmentation pattern that was identical to that obtained for a soluble protein carboxyl methyltransferase purified according to the same procedure, indicating a high degree of homology. These results support the notion that class II protein carboxyl methyltransferases are not restricted to a cytosolic localization and show that the membrane-bound form of this enzyme shares many characteristics with known cytosolic protein carboxyl methyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1558098763,"A nontransferable peptide analog of a plasma apolipoprotein diacyl lipid-associating peptide (diLAP) incorporates into model reassembled high density lipoproteins (R-HDL). In whole plasma in vitro, diLAP irreversibly transfers to native rat HDL2 and human HDL3, but not to rat HDL1 or human HDL2. The rate of transfer is dependent on the physical state of the lipid in the R-HDL. Exogenous cholesterol promotes the formation of larger HDL. When diLAP-labeled R-HDL were injected into rats, the diLAP that initially associated with HDL2 transferred to HDL1 over a period of 48 h. The rate of clearance of diLAP-labeled HDL was slower than that of apoA-I. The liver was the preferred site for diLAP-labeled HDL1 uptake. In contrast, diLAP-labeled HDL2 were associated with liver, ovaries, and adrenal glands, with the adrenal grands exhibiting the highest specific association. DiLAP was not found in the kidneys. These data show that 1) rat HDL is cleared more slowly than rat apoA-I; 2) HDL is removed from the plasma compartment as a particle; 3) there are tissue-specific differences in the removal of rat HDL1 and HDL2; 4) HDL2 is a precursor to HDL1; and 5) cholesterol and the activity of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase are essential to HDL remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1531125268,"We have examined, by use of a hybrid insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I analog and chimeric insulin/type I insulin-like growth factor receptors, the interplay between ligand and receptor structure in determining the affinity and specificity of hormone-receptor interactions in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I systems. Our findings, obtained through the study of radiolabeled peptide binding to detergent-solubilized full-length receptors and to soluble truncated receptors, show that (a) the two-chain hybrid analog exhibits significant cross-reactivity with both receptor systems, (b) the exchange of appropriate domains in chimeric receptors enhances the receptor binding affinity of the analog by 3.5-21-fold, and (c) the affinity of the hybrid analog for the chimeric receptors actually exceeds that of either natural insulin or natural insulin-like growth factor-I. We conclude that the specificity-conferring domains of the insulin and type I insulin-like growth factor receptors reside in different regions of a common binding site, and that the exchange of domains between pairs of related hormones and between pairs of related receptors can yield new ligand-receptor systems with significantly altered affinities and selectivities."
https://openalex.org/W2113316951,"The stoichiometric reductive debromination of BrCCl3 to a trichloromethyl radical by myoglobin caused the prosthetic heme to become covalently cross-linked to the protein moiety and transformed myoglobin from an oxygen storage protein to an oxidase. This was shown in experiments in which oxygen consumption was measured during redox cycling of the altered myoglobin in the presence of ascorbate or an enzymatic reducing system containing diaphorase and NADH. Redox cycling eventually led to loss of the protein-bound heme adduct and oxidase activity of myoglobin. We have used molecular modeling and the known structure of the protein-bound heme adduct to identify probable mechanisms for transformation of myoglobin to an oxidase. Based on these modeling studies, the most likely structure of the experimentally observed adduct involves ligation to the heme iron of the epsilon-nitrogen atom of histidine 97 and/or that of histidine 64. The model structures revealed access of solvent to the heme active site, which could facilitate oxygen reduction. The transformation of myoglobins and perhaps other hemoproteins to oxidases may have toxicological importance in causing the tissue damage resulting from exposure to various xenobiotics and endogenous chemicals as well as explaining how hemoproteins are inactivated during catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W1595771421,"When introduced as part of DNA constructions containing the human beta-globin locus control region (LCR), the human embryonic beta-globin gene, epsilon, is expressed in primitive but not definitive erythroid cells of recipient transgenic mice. In contrast to this pattern, the human fetal beta-globin gene, gamma, has been shown to be expressed in both primitive and definitive erythroid cells of transgenic mice when introduced in similar LCR-containing constructions. To begin to identify the minimal sequence(s) necessary for the epsilon expression pattern, we have fused a DNA fragment that contains the human epsilon-globin gene promoter region, and 13.7-kilobase (kb) of contiguous upstream flanking sequence containing super-hypersensitive (HS) sites 5'HS-2 and 5'HS-1 of the globin LCR, to the structural portion and near 3'-flanking region of the human gamma-globin gene. This construction, and one containing an intact human gamma-globin gene with the same 3'-flanking sequence and 383 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence linked to LCR DNA from -0.86 to -13.7 kb upstream of epsilon, were each microinjected to produce transgenic mice. While the construction containing the intact gamma-globin gene is transcriptionally active in primitive and definitive erythroid cells of the transgenic mice, the fusion construction, in which the gamma-globin gene promoter and promoter proximal region is essentially replaced by that of epsilon, is not active in definitive erythroid cells and expresses with the same pattern as an intact epsilon gene. These results indicate that the promoter and near 5'-flanking region of epsilon, when linked to the LCR, is sufficient for embryonic-specific expression in transgenic mice. The level of expression of the fusion construction in primitive erythroid cells of transgenic mice is similar to that previously observed for the intact epsilon gene when identically cloned. This suggests that the epsilon 5'-region of the fusion construction also contains all the sequence necessary for the LCR-dependent activation of epsilon in transgenic mice."
