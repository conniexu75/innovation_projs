https://openalex.org/W2040385059,"A number of genetic studies have suggested numerous susceptibility genes for dental caries over the past decade with few definite conclusions. The rapid accumulation of relevant information, along with the complex architecture of the disease, provides a challenging but also unique opportunity to review and integrate the heterogeneous data for follow-up validation and exploration. In this study, we collected and curated candidate genes from four major categories: association studies, linkage scans, gene expression analyses, and literature mining. Candidate genes were prioritized according to the magnitude of evidence related to dental caries. We then searched for dense modules enriched with the prioritized candidate genes through their protein-protein interactions (PPIs). We identified 23 modules comprising of 53 genes. Functional analyses of these 53 genes revealed three major clusters: cytokine network relevant genes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) family, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) family, all of which have been previously implicated to play important roles in tooth development and carious lesions. Through our extensive data collection and an integrative application of gene prioritization and PPI network analyses, we built a dental caries-specific sub-network for the first time. Our study provided insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying dental caries. The framework we proposed in this work can be applied to other complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1569904835,"We describe here the complete genome sequence (1,111,523 base pairs) of the obligate intracellular parasite Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative agent of epidemic typhus. This genome contains 834 protein-coding genes. The functional profiles of these genes show similarities to those of mitochondrial genes: no genes required for anaerobic glycolysis are found in either R. prowazekii or mitochondrial genomes, but a complete set of genes encoding components of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory-chain complex is found in R. prowazekii. In effect, ATP production in Rickettsia is the same as that in mitochondria. Many genes involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of biosynthesis of amino acids and nucleosides in free-living bacteria are absent from R. prowazekii and mitochondria. Such genes seem to have been replaced by homologues in the nuclear (host) genome. The R. prowazekii genome contains the highest proportion of non-coding DNA (24%) detected so far in a microbial genome. Such non-coding sequences may be degraded remnants of 'neutralized' genes that await elimination from the genome. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that R. prowazekii is more closely related to mitochondria than is any other microbe studied so far."
https://openalex.org/W1968024679,"Type I collagen fibers account for 90% of the organic matrix of bone. The degradation of this collagen is a major event during bone resorption, but its mechanism is unknown. A series of data obtained in biological models strongly suggests that the recently discovered cysteine proteinase cathepsin K plays a key role in bone resorption. Little is known, however, about the actual action of cathepsin K on type I collagen. Here, we show that the activity of cathepsin K alone is sufficient to dissolve completely insoluble collagen of adult human cortical bone. We found that the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K is directed both outside the helical region of the molecule, i.e. the typical activity of cysteine proteinases, and at various sites inside the helical region, hitherto believed to resist all mammalian proteinases but the collagenases of the matrix metalloproteinase family and the neutrophil elastase. This property of cathepsin K is unique among mammalian proteinases and is reminiscent of bacterial collagenases. It is likely to be responsible for the key role of cathepsin K in bone resorption.

The only mammalian proteinases that have been shown to attack the native triple helical region of type I collagen are the collagenases of the MMP1 family (1Birkedahl-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I.

Proteinases with broad specificity, such as cysteine proteinases, attack only the extrahelical regions that are located at either end of native collagen (telopeptides) and that represent only 4% of the molecule (5Murphy G. Reynolds J.J. Royce P.M. Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc, New York1993: 287-316Google Scholar). Because the telopeptides are involved in intra- and intermolecular links, this attack may separate individual molecules. The latter proteinases may also attack destabilized triple helices, acting thereby as gelatinases. At 37 °C, such a destabilization may transiently affect a small proportion of collagen molecules, because the melting temperature of soluble collagen is only a few degrees higher. It has also been emphasized that when collagen molecules are cross-linked and arranged in insoluble fibers they become more resistant to proteolysis (6Eeckout Y. Delaissé J.-M. Ledent P. Vaes G. Glauert A.M. The Control of Tissue Damage. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1988: 237-313Google Scholar). However, the co-operation of proteinases with distinct specificities toward the chemical bonds of collagen fibers has been shown to favor the efficiency of collagenolysis (7Danielsen C.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Insoluble type I collagen fibers constitute 90% of the organic matrix of bone, and their degradation is necessary for bone resorption (8Delaissé J.-M. Vaes G. Rifkin B.R. Gay C.V. Biology and Physiology of the Osteoclast. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 289-314Google Scholar). The test tube experiments that have been performed so far showed that it is difficult to achieve complete degradation of adult lamellar bone with a single bone proteinase (9Etherington D.J Connect. Tissue Res. 1977; 5: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10Etherington D.J. Birkedahl-Hansen H. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the other hand, various biological approaches have shown that both MMPs and cysteine proteinases participate in the bone resorption processes (8Delaissé J.-M. Vaes G. Rifkin B.R. Gay C.V. Biology and Physiology of the Osteoclast. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 289-314Google Scholar, 11Delaissé J.-M. Eeckhout Y. Vaes G. Biochem.

Physiol. 1992; 150: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Representatives of these two types of proteinases were identified in osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. MMP-9 is the best established MMP in osteoclasts and is highly expressed by these cells (14Tezuka K. Nemoto K. Tezuka Y. Sato T. Ikeda Y. Kobori M. Kamashima H. Eguchi H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15006-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, since the recent discovery of the cysteine proteinase cathepsin K (15Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1106-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a number of biological data have suggested that cathepsin K plays an unique role among the various osteoclast proteinases. Its expression correlates extremely well with bone resorption (16Littlewood-Evans A. Kokubo T. Ishibashi O. Inaoka T. Wlodarski B. Gallagher J.A.

Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and more importantly, it was shown that bone resorption is impaired in situations of cathepsin K deficiency (20Inui T. Ishibashi O. Inaoka T. Origane Y. Kumegawa M. Kokubo T. Yamamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8109-8112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,21Gelb B.D. Shi G.-P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), thus demonstrating the effective participation of cathepsin K in bone resorption. Among these situations is pycnodysostosis, a human recessive disease in which a mutation in the cathepsin K gene leads to decreased osteoclast function. An obvious question raised by the key role of cathepsin K in bone resorption concerns its efficiency in degrading bone collagen. Cleavage of soluble type I collagen has been shown in test tube experiments (22Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar,23Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E.

It has not been investigated either whether cleavage of collagen by cathepsin K occurs through the mechanism typical of other cysteine proteinases. To address these questions, we investigated the ability of cathepsin K to degrade adult cortical bone and compared it to MMP-9, the other proteinase found to be highly expressed in osteoclasts, and we analyzed the fragmentation pattern of collagen by cathepsin K by using SDS-PAGE and amino acid sequencing. Active recombinant human cathepsin K was prepared as described (23Bossard M.J. Tomaszek T.A. Thompson S.K. Amegadzie B.Y. Hanning C.R. Jones C. Kurdyla J.T. McNulty D.E. Drake F.H. Gowen M.

Recombinant human pro-MMP-9 was a kind gift of Dr. W. Stetler-Stevenson (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) and Dr. R. Fridman (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI); it was activated with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (Sigma) for 24 h at 34 °C. Recombinant human pro-MMP-13 was a kind gift of Drs. V. Knaüper and G. Murphy (University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom); it was activated with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 30 min at 37 °C. Activated recombinant human MMP-1 and pro-MMP-1 were a generous gift of Dr. H. Nagase (University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS); the pro-MMP-1 was activated with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 4 h at 37 °C. Crude bacterial collagenase (Sigma type I) andl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin were purchased from Sigma. The molar concentrations of active cathepsin L and K were determined by active site titration (25Knight C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using E-64 (Sigma), and that of the MMPs was determined by using BB94 ((4-(N-hydroxyamino)-2R-isobutyl-3-S-(thienylthiomethyl)-succinyl)-l-phenylalanine-N-methylamide) (kind gift of Dr. H. Van Wart, Roche, Palo Alto, CA). Normal cortical bone of a 70-year-old woman was finely ground in liquid nitrogen. The bone powder was defeated with ice-cold acetone for 2 h, rinsed with ice-cold water, and then demineralized in 10% formic acid for 3 days at 4 °C, with daily renewal of formic acid. The powder was then extensively washed with ice-cold water and freeze-dried. Ninety-five % of this powder consisted of collagen according to hydroxyproline determinations and considering that 1 mg of collagen contains 124 μg of hydroxyproline. The demineralized bone particles were then dispersed at a concentration of 4 mg/ml in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 20 mm l-cysteine, and 5 mm EDTA for cathepsin K, or in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 10 mmCaCl2 for MMPs and bacterial collagenase. Enzymatic assays were performed by mixing 0.5-ml aliquots of the suspension of bone particles (i.e. 2 mg of collagen) and 0.5 ml of proteinase diluted in the corresponding buffer so as to obtain a molar ratio of active enzyme:collagen of 1:30 (taking into account the active site titrations of the proteinases and the amount of triple helix of collagen in each test tube). Incubations were then performed in triplicates for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Because the proteinases proved to lose their activity after 24 h, the incubation mixtures were supplemented daily with the initial dose of fresh enzyme, which was delivered in a volume of 50 μl. Blank assays were also performed by incubating the bone powder in buffer without proteinase. After incubation, the mixtures were centrifuged for 20 min at 1500 × g at 4 °C. Hydroxyproline was determined by a spectrophotometric method in the supernatant and in the pellet, after hydrolysis in 6 m HCl for 22 h at 110 °C (26Firschein H.E. Shill J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 14: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The amount of solubilized collagen was calculated for each incubation mixture from the hydroxyproline determinations in the supernatant and the corresponding pellet. The supernatants were also assessed for type I collagen C-terminal (CTX) and N-terminal (NTX) telopeptide breakdown products using the Crosslaps™ (Osteometer Biotech, Herlev, Denmark) (27Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and Osteomark™ (Ostex International, Seattle, WA) (28Hanson D.A.

Native acid-soluble guinea pig (generous gift of Dr. Y. Eeckout; ICP-UCL, Brussels, Belgium) or bovine (kind gift of Dr. Huc, Colletica, Lyon, France) acid-extracted type I collagen was used at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml (i.e. 2.67 μm when considering a molecular mass of 300 kDa, corresponding to nonpolymerized triple helices) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 20 mm l-cysteine, and 5 mm EDTA for cathepsins L and K, or in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and 10 mm CaCl2 for MMP-1 and trypsin. This collagen was incubated with proteinases at concentrations ranging from 0.08 to 2.14 μm, during various times, at 15 or 25 °C. After incubation, the reactions of cathepsins K and L were stopped with 430 μm E-64, and those of MMP-1 were stopped with 50 mm EDTA. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. To relate migration distances to molecular weights, it was taken into account that the electrophoretic mobility of the α1 chain and its fragments differs from that of the α2 chain and its fragments (29French M.F. Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The type I collagen fragments generated by cathepsin K were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The type I collagen fragment bands were cut, and the N-terminal sequencing was performed on a 477A protein sequencer with an on-line 120A analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and chemicals recommended by the manufacturer. The first 10–14 residues were analyzed and compared with known sequences of human and bovine type I collagen (SWISS-PROT™ Protein Data Bank). We first investigated to what extent cathepsin K can solubilize the collagen of adult cortical bone. Fig. 1 shows that cathepsin K solubilized 40% of the collagen after 1 day of incubation, about 80% after 3 days, and almost all of it after 4 days. This solubilization by cathepsin K proved to be almost as extensive as that obtained with crude bacterial collagenase, but it was slower. Several MMPs were tested at the same molar concentration as cathepsin K. MMP-9, a gelatinase that is highly expressed in osteoclasts, achieved only half the solubilization of cathepsin K at each time point, and after 72 h, the solubilization reached only 38% of the total amount. Collagenases such as MMP-1 and MMP-13 degraded about 8% of the collagen after 1 day and about 18% after 4 days. We also analyzed whether some of the reaction products might be recognized by antibodies directed against the N and C telopeptide fragments of type I collagen and that proved to be specific and sensitive reagents to assess bone resorption in vivo (27Bonde M. Qvist P. Fledelius C. Riis B.J. Christiansen C. Clin. Chem. 1994; 40: 2022-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar,28Hanson D.A. Weis M.A.E. Bollen A.M. Maslan S.H. Singer F.R. Eyre D.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). MMP-9, MMP-1, and MMP-13 did not release fragments that are recognized by these antibodies (not shown). In contrast, crude bacterial collagenase (not shown) and cathepsin K (Table I) released NTX and CTX antigens with a similar time dependence.Table ICTX and NTX telopeptide breakdown products generated from adult human cortical bone collagen by cathepsin KDuration of incubationCTXNTXhng/mg of collagenpmol/mg of collagen24124 ± 21367 ± 5948304 ± 12718 ± 11072861 ± 922226 ± 143Collagen was solubilized exactly as explained in Fig. 1 and analyzed by ELISA for CTX and NTX.

To investigate the mechanism of collagen fragmentation by cathepsin K, incubations of soluble collagen were performed at 25 °C, a temperature at which it is believed that the triple helix cannot be cleaved by any proteinase, except the collagenases of the MMP family (1Birkedahl-Hansen H.

J. 1998; 330: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Accordingly, unspecific proteinases like trypsin (not shown) or the cysteine proteinase cathepsin L both used at 2.14 μm (Fig. 2,II) did not cleave the triple helix, whereas MMP-1 cleaved it into the characteristic 3/4N-terminal (TCA) and 1/4C-terminal (TCB) fragments (Fig. 2,I). Cathepsin L, however, generated monomeric α chains, at the expense of the dimeric (β) and trimeric (γ) chains, as is typical of cysteine proteinases and due to a cleavage at the level of the telopeptides. Upon incubation with cathepsin K at a concentration 30 times lower than that of cathepsin L, a similar electrophoretic pattern was obtained. An important difference, however, was that the “monomer-like” bands generated by cathepsin K migrated slightly faster, suggesting a possible cleavage in the helical region (Fig. 2,II) (22Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). When using a 30 times higher concentration of cathepsin K (i.e. the same concentration as the one used for cathepsin L), more bands were generated, suggesting further cleavage of the triple helix (Fig. 2, V). When incubating for a longer time, no more bands appeared, but the lower molecular weight bands became stronger at the expense of the higher molecular weight bands. This collagen fragmentation was not due to a peculiarity of the guinea pig collagen, as similar results were obtained with bovine skin collagen (Fig. 2, VI). E-64, an inhibitor of cathepsin K, blocked all the above described effects of cathepsin K (Fig. 2,III). We also analyzed the activity of cathepsin K in a situation where collagen triple helices and their fragments exhibit still higher stability, and we therefore performed incubations at 15 °C. Fig. 2 shows that a 10-min incubation was sufficient to weaken the dimer and trimer bands and increase monomer-like bands (Fig. 2, III); 2 h more allowed the generation of shorter fragments (Fig. 2, IV), and a further 2 h did not result in changing significantly the migration pattern. In order to analyze the cleavage sites further, similar experiments were repeated, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed (Table II). First, we analyzed the high molecular weight monomer-like bands generated from the dimers and trimers of guinea pig collagen after a 30-min incubation at 15 °C. We found evidence for a cleavage inside the triple helix exactly 10 amino acids away from the N-terminal ends of the helical regions of both α1 and α2 chains. This thus may explain why monomer-like bands generated by cathepsin K migrate slightly faster than those generated by cathepsin L. Among the cleavage sites generated upon longer incubation at 15 °C, one was clearly identified 811 and 815 amino acids away from the N-terminal ends of the helical domains of the α1 and α2 chains, respectively (i.e. about 35 amino acids from the cleavage site of interstitial collagenases). Other cleavage sites proved to be difficult to determine, probably due to the same problem as the one encountered for the analysis of the fragmentation of type I collagen by bacterial collagenases (30French M.F. Bhown A. Van Wart H.E. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and ascribed to the heterotrimeric nature of type I collagen and to the regularity of the repetitions of similar amino acid sequences in the α chains. However, in an effort to further demonstrate cleavage sites in the triple helical area of stable collagen molecules, we also performed incubations under other conditions. When using cathepsin K at 25 °C and at a concentration 30 times lower than in the above experiments, we found evidence for cleavage sites in the α1 and α2 chains, which are 97 and 100 amino acids, respectively, away from the N-terminal end of their helical domains. When using bovine type I collagen, we also found evidence for a cleavage site in the triple helix exactly 22 amino acids away from the N-terminal ends of the helical region of both the α1 and α2 chains. These data clearly establish the ability of cathepsin K to cleave the triple helix of type I collagen at multiple sites.Table IIN-terminal amino acid sequencing of fragments generated by the action of cathepsin K on type I collagenIncubation conditionSequenceCollagen sourceTemperatureCathepsin K: collagenTimeSpeciesα1 Chainα2 Chain° Cmol/molhGuinea pig150.80.5 and 2Guinea pig2-aExperimentally determined.X9X-10GLPGPPGAPGAQGFX 9 X-10GPPGAVGAPGPQGFHuman2-bFrom data bank.P9R-10GLPGPPGAPGPQGFP9R-10GPPGAAGAPGPQGFGuinea pig250.0316Guinea pig2-aExperimentally determined.X96X-97GAKGDAGPAGX99X-100GQPGAPGVKGEPGAHuman2-bFrom data bank.L96D-97GAKGDAGPAGL99K-100GQPGAPGVKGEPGAGuinea pig15 and 250.82Guinea pig2-aExperimentally determined.X 810 X-811GASGERGPPGPAX 814G-815ARGPPGNVGXPGVHuman2-bFrom data bank.P810S-811GASGERGPPGPMP814G-815ARGPPGAVGSPGVBovine250.86Bovine2-aExperimentally determined.P21Q-22GFQGPPGEPGEPP21Q-22GFQGPPGEPGEPBovine2-bFrom data bank.P21Q-22GFQGPPGEPGEPP21Q-22GFQGPPGEPGEPHuman2-bFrom data bank.P21Q-22GFQGPPGEPGEPP21Q-22GFQGPAGEPGEPGuinea pig or bovine fragments were generated by incubation with cathepsin K.

Note that same cleavage sites were found for distinct incubation times or temperatures. Type I collagen is one of the most abundant molecules in mammals, and its degradation is an important physiological issue. So far, only two collagenolytic mechanisms have been described in mammals (Fig. 3). One is used by interstitial collagenases cleaving the stable triple helices of collagen at a single site between their amino acids 775 and 776. The other is used by proteinases with broad specificity, such as cysteine proteinases, cleaving the nonhelical telopeptides of native type I collagen and also degrading denatured collagen (i.e. gelatin). The present work shows that there is a third mechanism reminiscent of bacterial collagenases (29French M.F. Mookhtiar K.A. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30French M.F. Bhown A. Van Wart H.E. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Lecroisey A. Keil B. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 33-58Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the peculiarity of which is cleavage of native triple helices at multiple sites, and that this mechanism is used by cathepsin K, a recently discovered cysteine proteinase (15Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1106-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is essential for osteoclastic bone resorption (20Inui T. Ishibashi O. Inaoka T. Origane Y. Kumegawa M. Kokubo T. Yamamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8109-8112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 21Gelb B.D. Shi G.-P. Chapman H.A. Desnick R.J. Science. 1996; 273: 1236-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The evidence for this new collagenolytic mechanism is based on the analysis of collagen fragments generated by cathepsin K at 15 and 25 °C. The stability of the helical region of the collagen molecules under these assay conditions was obvious from the absence of cleavage of the triple helix by unspecific proteinases. These included cathepsin L, the cysteine proteinase hitherto considered to have the highest telopeptidase and gelatinase activity (32Maciewicz R.A. Etherington D.J. Kos J. Turk V. Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Maciewicz R.A. Etherington D.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). That the α chains were not unraveled at the time of the attack by cathepsin K was further demonstrated by the fact that cleavage sites, at least two of them, were found exactly at the same position in the α1 and α2 chains. The fragmentation by cathepsin K was not an artifact, but really results from cysteine proteinase activity during incubation because it was completely blocked by a cysteine proteinase inhibitor. The cleavage sites inside the triple helix were clearly demonstrated not only because the size of the bands detected by electrophoresis was compatible with the size of fragments arising from the helical region, but also because the amino acid sequences of eight fragments (i.e. four from α1 chains and four from α2 chains) matched the amino acid sequences of the helical region of α1 and α2 chains reported in data bases. Interestingly, none of the identified cleavage sites corresponded to that of interstitial collagenase (1Birkedahl-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedahl-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar) or to those of bacterial collagenases (30French M.F. Bhown A. Van Wart H.E. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the specificity of the cleavage of collagen is determined by the type of proteinase, rather than by the position of hyperactive sites in the collagen molecule. Finally, it is worth noting that cathepsin K also generated collagen fragments that are recognized by the Crosslaps ELISA. Because these fragments are recognized by the ELISA only if there is a cleavage between Arg22 and Tyr23 of the α1 C-terminal telopeptide (34Bonde M. Garnero P. Fledelius C. Qvist P. Delmas P.D. Christiansen C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), this demonstrates a cleavage site in the C-terminal telopeptide. Thus, cathepsin K has telopeptidase activity like other cysteine proteinases, as previously suggested (22Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); it has gelatinase activity (22Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar); and as shown above, it shares with bacterial proteinases the ability to cleave collagen at multiple points. It is of interest to consider the consequences of these properties for proteolysis of collagen in the physiological situation at 37 °C. Interstitial collagenases will cleave stable triple helices of all accessible collagen molecules but only at a single site. Cysteine proteinases other than cathepsin K will cleave the telopeptides and may also attack the small proportion of soluble collagen molecules that have a transiently destabilized helix. In addition to this, cathepsin K will attack any collagen molecule at multiple sites irrespective of its conformation. What makes cathepsin K unique among mammalian proteinases is the fact that its collagenolytic activity does not depend on destabilization of the triple helix in contrast to that of the other cysteine proteinases and that it cleaves native molecules at more sites than does interstitial collagenase. Thus, cathepsin K alone can both depolymerize collagen fibers and cleave triple helices, whereas it was previously thought that distinct proteinases were required to perform these activities and that their cooperation was necessary for an efficient degradation of insoluble cross-linked type I collagen (6Eeckout Y. Delaissé J.-M. Ledent P. Vaes G. Glauert A.M. The Control of Tissue Damage. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1988: 237-313Google Scholar, 7Danielsen C.C. Biochem.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 289-314Google Scholar). These different models of collagenolysis are consistent both with the present test tube experiments showing that cathepsin K can degrade completely the insoluble collagen of adult cortical bone in the absence of other proteinases, and with earlier reports on poor solubilization of bone collagen by other proteinases, whether interstitial collagenases or gelatinases (6Eeckout Y. Delaissé J.-M. Ledent P. Vaes G. Glauert A.M. The Control of Tissue Damage. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1988: 237-313Google Scholar, 7Danielsen C.C. Biochem.

Collagen Relat. Res. 1987; 7: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The latter observations were confirmed in the present study with two distinct interstitial collagenases and a gelatinase used at the same concentrations as cathepsin K. The progress of collagen solubilization in these assays was faster at the beginning and slower at the end, despite the additions of fresh proteinase. This decrease in the rate of solubilization may be due to the fact that highly susceptible collagen was degraded first and the remaining more resistant cross-linked collagen later (9Etherington D.J Connect. Tissue Res. 1977; 5: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although it is not possible to know how close are these test tube experiments to the conditions under which cathepsin K acts in the resorption zone, it is of interest to draw the attention to two aspects. First, concerning the molar ratio of cathepsin K to collagen of 0.03 used in our assays, it should be mentioned thatin vivo, collagen degradation in the resorption zone occurs as soon as the collagen is denuded by the demineralization processes (35Vaes G. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1988; 231: 239-271PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of demineralized collagen in the resorption zone is therefore quite low at any time, and this is a situation that should favor a relatively high concentration of cathepsin K as compared with that of collagen. Second, it is of interest that our assays were performed at pH 5.5, the pH for optimal activity of cathepsin K (22Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and that this pH is within the range of pH values of 4.7–6.8, measured in the resorption zone of osteoclasts (36Silver A. Murrills R.J. Etherington D.J Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Cathepsin K alone can thus solubilize completely the major constituent of the bone matrix in conditions compatible with those of the resorption zone. MMP-9 is another proteinase that is highly expressed in osteoclasts (14Tezuka K. Nemoto K. Tezuka Y. Sato T. Ikeda Y. Kobori M. Kamashima H. Eguchi H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15006-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been speculated that it might be one of the MMPs (37Okada Y. Naka K. Kawamura K. Matsumoto T. Nakanishi I. Fujimoto N. Sato H. Seiki M. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar) playing a role in collagen degradation in the resorption zone (13Everts V. Delaissé J.-M. Korper W. Niehof A. Vaes G. Beertsen W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It is of interest that in our test tube experiments, the level of collagen degradation by MMP-9 reached 50% of that obtained by cathepsin K when tested at pH 7.5, the optimal pH for MMP-9 activity. Taking into account the fact that at pH 6, MMP-9 still shows 90% of its activity at pH 7.5 (37Okada Y. Naka K. Kawamura K. Matsumoto T. Nakanishi I. Fujimoto N. Sato H. Seiki M. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar), we thus have to consider that MMP-9 may contribute to some extent to the collagenolytic activity of the osteoclast. However, according to our data, the efficiency of cathepsin K is at least twice as important. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that cathepsin K degrades type I collagen by using a mechanism that has never been reported for mammalian proteinases. This unique collagenolytic mechanism allows interpretation of the key role of cathepsin K in bone resorption (16Littlewood-Evans A. Kokubo T. Ishibashi O. Inaoka T. Wlodarski B. Gallagher J.A.

Here, we demonstrate that treatment of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with these p38 MAP kinase inhibitors prevents their differentiation into adipocytes as judged by an absence of lipid accumulation, a lack of expression of adipocyte-specific genes, and a fibroblastic morphological appearance. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and developing adipocytes, p38 is active. p38 activity decreases dramatically during later stages of differentiation. In accordance with the time course of p38 activity, p38 inhibitor treatment during only the early stages of differentiation is sufficient to block adipogenesis. In addition, we constructed a 3T3-L1 cell line harboring an inducible dominant negative p38 mutant. The induction of this dominant negative mutant of p38 prevents adipocyte differentiation. Thus, it is likely that the antiadipogenic activity of SB203580 and SB202190 is indeed due to inhibition of p38 MAP kinase.This study points out that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), a transcription factor critical for the initial stages of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis, bears a consensus site for p38 phosphorylation and serves as a substrate for p38 MAP kinase in vitro. Although the induction of C/EBPβ is not significantly altered in the presence of the p38 inhibitor, the amount of in vivo phosphorylated C/EBPβ is reduced by SB203580. The transcriptional induction of PPARγ, a gene whose expression is induced by C/EBPβ, and a factor critically involved in terminal differentiation of adipocytes, is impaired in the presence of p38 inhibitors. Thus, transcription factors such as C/EBPβ that promote adipocyte differentiation may be p38 targets during adipogenesis. Collectively, the data in this study suggest that p38 MAP kinase activity is important for proper 3T3-L1 differentiation.

They are extremely specific, as SB203580 has no inhibitory activity on all kinases tested in vitro, including the other MAP kinases, at concentrations greater than 10-fold the concentration used in our treatment of 3T3-L1 cells (6Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 8: 229-233Google Scholar). In addition, the human homolog of p38 MAP kinase was discovered because it was specifically photoaffinity-labeled by a derivative of SB202190. This compound inhibits LPS-stimulated IL-1 and TNFα production, and p38 is its molecular target (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J.

Recently, a crystal structure of p38 in complex with SB203580 revealed that the inhibitor binds within the ATP pocket of the kinase (8Tong L. Pav S. White D.M. Rogers S. Crane K.M. Cywin C.L.

Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar), is homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae HOG1 kinase (12Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The p38 pathway is not commonly activated by mitogens; instead, it is usually induced by stressing cells with endotoxins, osmotic shock, or metabolic inhibitors.However, although much has been learned regarding the importance of p38 MAP kinase in inflammatory and stress responses, relatively little is known regarding its role in differentiation processes. Recently, it was shown that p38 MAP kinase activities are elevated in association with the onset of hypertrophy and programmed cell death in cardiac myocytes. Indeed, upstream activators of p38 MAP kinase, MKK3 and MKK6, are sufficient to promote these phenotypic changes (3Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

The conversion of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes is a paradigm for terminal differentiation. This process can be studied in cell culture (14Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 15Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Markers for the predifferentiated and fully differentiated states have been characterized, and some factors that drive this process have been identified (for recent reviews, see Refs. 16Loftus T.M. Lane M.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1997; 13: 231-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In our own work, we have primarily focused on 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, which can be differentiated to mature adipocytes within a period of approximately 8 days. The sequence of events that leads to the accumulation of triglycerides and the induction of adipocyte-specific markers includes transient activation of key factors. The C/EBP family of transcription factors participates at all stages of the differentiation program. In particular, induction of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ is observed early in the differentiation process. The standard differentiation protocol includes a mixture of insulin, dexamethasone and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (20Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine governs induction of C/EBPβ, and dexamethasone is responsible for the induction of C/EBPδ in 3T3-L1 cells (21Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). Overexpression of C/EBPβ in 3T3-L1 cells abrogates the need for 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dexamethasone during differentiation (22Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 15: 168-181Crossref Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of C/EBPβ in NIH3T3 fibroblasts cells together with appropriate hormonal stimulation is sufficient to drive these cells through adipogenesis (22Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 15: 168-181Crossref Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of C/EBPα in NIH-3T3 cells stimulates adipocyte differentiation (23Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition, the constitutive expression of another factor, PPARγ, promotes conversion of NIH-3T3 cells into adipocytes in the presence of the appropriate activating ligand (24Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar,25Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). In fact, it is believed that C/EBPβ induction and activation early in 3T3-L1 differentiation is directly responsible for the transcriptional activation of PPARγ (17Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Altiok S. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Wu Z. Xie Y. Bucher N.L. Farmer S.R.

A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar).We demonstrate that inhibitors of p38 MAP kinases as well as a dominant negative p38 prevent conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes. p38 is present throughout the adipocyte differentiation process. However, p38 kinase activity and phosphorylation are observed only during the early phases of differentiation. Accordingly, treatment of these cells with p38 inhibitors during only the initial stages of differentiation is sufficient to block adipogenesis, and inhibition of p38 during later stages of differentiation has little effect. Our data suggest that C/EBPβ may be a direct target of p38 MAP kinase. Inhibition of p38 kinase leads to reduced levels of C/EBPβ phosphorylation in vivo, and p38 phosphorylates C/EBPβin vitro, suggesting a possible direct link between p38 MAP kinase and adipogenic transcription factors.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have focused on the role of p38 MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocyte conversion. p38 MAP kinase is present throughout differentiation, but its activity decreases by day 4 of the differentiation program. When 3T3-L1 cells are differentiated in the presence of p38 inhibitors, adipogenesis, as measured by (i) lipid accumulation, (ii) cell morphology, and (iii) induction of several adipocyte-specific marker proteins, is severely inhibited. In agreement with the observation that p38 MAP kinase activity is observed during only the initial stages of differentiation, the presence of p38 inhibitors during these early stages is sufficient to block adipogenesis. In addition, expression of a dominant negative p38 mutant strongly inhibits the differentiation process, suggesting that the antiadipogenic effects of SB203580 and SB202190 are indeed due to inactivation of p38 and are less likely to be due to an effect on other kinases.The inhibitors used for this study are highly specific, since they have no inhibitory activity on all other kinases tested in vitro, including other MAP kinases, at concentrations greater than 10-fold the concentration we used for treatment of the 3T3-L1 cells (6Cuenda A.

A recent report (3Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) describes a role for the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in cardiac hypertrophic growth in response to phenylephrine. Although not a genuine differentiation process per se, those observations hint at the pluripotent effects of p38 MAP kinase beyond conventional stress-induced phenomena observed in most cell types. Other systems amenable to a differentiation protocol in tissue culture will have to be tested to establish the generality of this phenomenon.p38 MAP kinase was first identified by Han et al. (11Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) in studies demonstrating phosphorylation of a 38-kDa protein in cells stimulated with lipopolysacharides. This kinase was found to be the mouse homolog of the S. cerevisiae HOG1, a MAP kinase required for growth in conditions of high osmolarity (12Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Human homologues of p38 MAP kinase were described by Lee et al.(7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). They discovered that an inhibitor (similar to SB202190) prevents lipopolysacharide-stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines. This compound specifically photoaffinity-labeled the human homologs of p38 MAP kinase. Recently, novel members of the p38 family have been identified. The p38 MAP kinase family now consists of p38α (7Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E.

Although we do not know which isoform(s) of p38 are responsible for promoting 3T3-L1 differentiation, it is unlikely to be p38δ or p38γ, since p38δ is not inhibited by SB2020190, and p38γ’s expression seems to be restricted chiefly to skeletal muscle (53Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). In addition, some studies report that p38γ is not inhibited by SB203580 (1Cuenda A. Cohen P. Buee-Scherrer V. Goedert M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 36Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Davis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1741-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), but that finding is in conflict with the results of another study (53Li Z. Jiang Y. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Northern analysis of 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated the presence of p38α throughout differentiation (data not shown). In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers capable of amplifying both p38α and p38β with similar efficiencies produce amplicons corresponding to p38α 10 times more frequently than amplicons corresponding to p38β when used on first strand cDNA from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (data not shown). This suggests that p38α is the most predominant p38 form in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that p38β1 or p38β2 may also play a critical role in 3T3-L1 adipocyte conversion.We have looked at the effect of p38 activation on a number of known key p38 targets. We show that MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 is present and is a p38 target in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, since its phosphorylation is markedly reduced in the presence of p38 inhibitors (Fig. 2). We have found that another well described p38 target, ATF2, is present in this cell line and is a target for p38 (data not shown). The relative contributions of these and other, yet unknown, p38 targets toward adipogenesis remain to be determined.CHOP (GADD153) (56Fornace A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D. Papathanasiou M. Fargnoli J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4196-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) is a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors. Ectopic overexpression of CHOP inhibits adipogenesis, most likely by acting as a dominant negative inhibitor of C/EBP dimer-activated transcription of gene targets (4Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 18Mandrup S. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5367-5370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 57Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). A report by Wang and Ron (4Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) demonstrates that CHOP is phosphorylated much more efficiently by p38 MAP kinase than by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 or c-Jun N-terminal kinase. CHOP is phosphorylated by p38 MAP kinase on serine residues 78 and 81 in vitro and in vivo, and treatment with SB203580 blocks these phosphorylation events (4Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of residues 78 and 81 to alanine moderately mitigated the ability of CHOP overexpression to inhibit adipogenesis. However, our study suggests that when differentiated under endogenous conditions (i.e. without ectopic overexpression of CHOP), 3T3-L1 cells require p38 MAP kinase for proper adipocyte conversion. A sequence alignment of the C/EBP family revealed that the p38 MAP kinase recognition motif is conserved among all members of the family. Interestingly, another study demonstrated that the threonine in C/EBPβ corresponding to serine 81 of CHOP is essential for its transcriptional activity (48Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that p38 can directly phosphorylate C/EBPβ in vitro and that the amount of phosphorylated C/EBPβ is decreased in 3T3-L1 cells incubated in the presence of SB203580. We analyzed C/EBPβ because it is expressed early in differentiation at a time when p38 MAP kinase is active and because it strongly promotes adipocyte conversion. It is quite possible that p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates additional C/EBP factors to promote adipogenesis.In addition, phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by p38 MAP kinase may partially explain the previous observation that SB203580 blocked TNFα-induced interleukin-6 synthesis (2Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ was initially termed NF-IL6 because it was identified as a transcription factor that bound to the interleukin-1-responsive element in the promoter of the interleukin-6 gene. Thus, in the presence of SB203580, it may not activate transcription of interleukin-6 in response to TNFα because it requires phosphorylation by p38 MAP kinase for activity.Our results suggest that the p38 MAP kinase pathway is required for adipocyte differentiation. There have been contradictory reports in the literature concerning the importance of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway. Sale et al. (58Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) reported that 3T3-L1 cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides to p42/44 MAP kinase depleted p42/44 MAP kinases and severely blocked adipocyte differentiation. While the experiments described in this paper were ongoing, Font de Mora et al. (59Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) published a report that sharply contrasts with the findings reported by Sale et al. (58Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). They demonstrated that PD98059 (60Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), a selective MEK (and therefore p42/44 MAP kinase) inhibitor, does not inhibit differentiation. Furthermore, they show that cells overexpressing hyperactive MEK1 and MAPK do not differentiate well. We also found that treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with PD98059 has little effect on the ability of 3T3-L1 cells to round up and accumulate lipid (data not shown). Proteins harvested from day 8 3T3-L1 cells that were differentiated in the presence of the inhibitor were compared with protein lysates from control 3T3-L1 adipocytes. There were no significant differences in the accumulation of proteins normally induced during adipogenesis. Thus, while PD98059 effectively blocks activation of p42/44 MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown), it does not affect 3T3-L1 adipogenesis per se. However, while the level of lipid accumulation was not affected in the presence of the inhibitor, we noticed that PD98059-treated cells were significantly bigger. This is consistent with a recent observation by Porras and colleagues (64Porras A. Alvarez A.M. Valladares A. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 825-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that p42/44 activation is required for insulin-induced proliferation in rat fetal brown adipocytes. A possible explanation for the increased cell size that we observe in our 3T3-L1 system is that the MEK inhibitor inhibits the proliferative phase during differentiation, resulting in an increased cell volume. Additionally, we demonstrate that p42/44 MAP kinase activity sharply declines by day 4 of differentiation (Fig. 1). It is possible that the inability of the hyperactive MEK1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (p42/44) overexpressing 3T3-L1 cell lines to differentiate (59Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) (an observation also made in the study by Porraset al. (64Porras A. Alvarez A.M. Valladares A. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 825-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the rat fetal brown adipocyte system) may be partially due to the inappropriate expression of these kinases during the late stages of differentiation.TNFα has a strong inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation and can even induce dedifferentiation of fully mature adipocytes (65Ron D. Brasier A.R. McGehee R.E. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The inhibition of p42/44 MAP kinase allows cells to differentiate even in the presence of TNFα, suggesting that TNFα’s antiadipogenic effect requires activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway (59Font de Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Due to the strong antiadipogenic effect of the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors, the analogous experiment cannot be performed with the these inhibitors. However, we can take advantage of the fact that the addition of p38 inhibitors after day 4 of differentiation does not significantly inhibit adipogenesis. TNFα, however, even added after day 4 of differentiation, can still induce a marked inhibition of the adipocyte phenotype. When both p38 MAP kinase inhibitors and TNFα are added in combination on the fourth day of differentiation, TNFα is equally effective in blocking the differentiation process (data not shown), suggesting that the signal transduction cascades leading to the antiadipogenic effects of TNFα do not employ p38 MAP kinase. This explains the apparently conflicting observations that while p38 activation is an essential step for adipogenesis and TNFα can induce p38 activation in confluent fibroblasts, TNFα has a potent an"

We have investigated whether infection of hamsters with three TSE strains resulted in the formation of PrP-res with different conformations using limited proteinase K (PK) digestion and infrared spectroscopy. PrP-res isolated from the brains of hamsters infected with the hyper (HY), drowsy (DY), and 263K TSE strains yielded similar SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles prior to PK treatment. However, after limited digestion with PK, the PrP-res from the DY strain exhibited a fragmentation pattern that was distinct from that of the other two strains. Infrared spectra of HY and 263K PrP-res each had major absorption bands in the amide I region at 1626 and 1636 cm−1 both prior to and after digestion with PK. These bands were not evident in the DY PrP-res spectra, which had a unique band at 1629–1630 cm−1 and stronger band intensity at both 1616 and 1694–1695 cm−1. Because absorbances from 1616 to 1636 cm−1 of protein infrared spectra are attributed primarily to β-sheet structures, these findings indicate that the conformations of HY and 263K PrP-res differ from DY PrP-res at least in structural regions with β-sheet secondary structure. These results support the hypothesis that strain-specific PrP-res conformers can self-propagate by converting the normal prion protein to the abnormal conformers that induce phenotypically distinct TSE diseases.

The TSEs, like classical amyloid diseases, can have a sporadic or genetic (linked to mutations and insertions in the PrP gene) etiology, but the TSEs can also be infectious (for review see Ref. 1Caughey B. Chesebro B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 56-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Strong circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that PrP-res is the major component of the infectious agent, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The existence of TSE strains presents a major challenge to the protein-only hypothesis for the TSE agent. Although differences in the host PrP genotype can influence the phenotype of TSE disease for a single TSE strain, TSE strains also contain host-independent information and can be discriminated within a single host species or PrP genotype by reproducible differences in incubation period, clinical signs, vacuolar pathology, and PrP-res deposition (for review see Ref.12Bruce M.E. Fraser H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 172: 125-138PubMed Google Scholar). The basis of strain diversity among conventional pathogens is determined by variations in their nucleic acid genome, but no TSE agent-specific nucleic acid has been identified despite extensive searches. There is evidence suggesting that TSE strain propagation is determined by the self-propagation of PrP-res molecules that differ in conformation, polymeric states, and/or ligand associations (13Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B.

Science. 1996; 274: 2079-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). However, the molecular nature of the strain-dependent differences in PrP-res is poorly understood. Strain-specific properties of PrP-res were first seen among murine scrapie strains that differed in the relative proportions of PrP-res glycoforms (i.e. PrP molecules with zero, one, or twoN-linked glycans) (16Kascsak R.J.

Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: Scrapie, BSE and Related Human Disorders. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1991: 139-152Google Scholar). Evidence for the existence of multiple conformations of PrP-res has come from observations that PrP-res associated with different strains of TSEs are cleaved at different N-terminal sites by proteinase K (PK). This was first documented with the hyper (HY) and drowsy (DY) strains of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) passaged in Syrian golden hamsters (13Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HY and DY strains of TME can be serially propagated in hamsters, giving rise to distinct incubation periods, clinical symptoms and brain patterns of PrP-res deposition (19Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). After treatment with PK, the PrP-res from HY-infected hamsters had a ∼2-kDa larger molecular mass than PrP-res from DY-infected hamsters in SDS-PAGE analysis. This size shift was not due to additional glycosylation because it was observed in both unglycosylated and glycosylated PrP-res molecules. N-terminal sequencing revealed that PK cleaved additional residues from the N terminus of DY PrP-res compared with HY PrP-res. Because the DY and HY PrP-res molecules are derived from the same Syrian hamster PrP-sen precursor, it was concluded that the observed difference in cleavage by PK was due to strain-dependent differences in conformation and/or ligand binding. Evidence that the two strain-associated conformations of hamster PrP-res could self-propagate from the same hamster PrP-sen was obtained using a cell-free conversion reaction (14Bessen R.A.

In these studies, HY and DY PrP-res were each incubated with hamster PrP-sen, and the PrP-sen was converted to PK-resistant PrP products with the same ∼2-kDa difference in molecular mass that distinguishes the PK-treated HY and DY PrP-res molecules. This finding suggested that the strain-specific forms of PrP-res are faithfully propagated through direct PrP-sen-PrP-res interactions both in vitro and in vivo. More recently, additional strain-dependent differences in PrP-res have been observed with other TSEs (15Telling G.C. Parchi P. DeArmond S.J. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Gabizon R. Mastrianni J.

No high resolution structures of PrP-res have been determined because its aggregated properties are incompatible with current high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray diffraction techniques. However, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to measure the secondary structure of PK-treated PrP-res (10Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S.

These studies have examined the absorbance in the protein amide I region, an area sensitive to differences in protein secondary structure, and demonstrated that PrP-sen has a low β-sheet content compared with PrP-res from 263K scrapie-infected hamsters. In the present study, we have compared the conformations of PrP-res in the HY, DY, and 263K hamster TSE strains and found striking differences in secondary structures. These results provide evidence that differences in PrP-res conformation characterize TSE strain diversity at the molecular level. An adaptation of a previously described method was used to purify PrP-res (“p4” fraction, without PK digestion) (10Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 27Bolton D.C. Bendheim P.E. Marmostein A.D. Potempska A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) from the brains of hamsters in the clinical phase of disease after intracerebral inoculation with the designated TSE strain. At least three separate isolates of each type of PrP-res were analyzed by FTIR. To obtain PK-treated PrP-res, 100 μl of p4 fraction of PrP-res (1 mg/ml in 0.1% sulfobetaine in PBS (130 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4)) was diluted to 500 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl and digested with 5–10 μg/ml PK for 1 h at 37 °C. PefablocTM (Boehringer Mannheim) was then added to 1 mm to inhibit PK. To remove the PK and PefablocTM, the PrP-res aggregates were washed three times by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspension in 0.1% sulfobetaine in PBS. SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and immunoblotting analysis of the PrP-res fractions were performed as described previously (10Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 28Kocisko D.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13434-13442Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). PrP-res pellets containing 100–200 μg of protein were suspended in 8 μl of 0.1% sulfobetaine in PBS and spotted onto a CaF2 window of a variable pathlength infrared cell (International Crystal Labs). The cell was then assembled and adjusted to a ∼6-μm pathlength. After purging of the sample compartment with dried air to reduce water vapor contributions, spectra were collected at 23 °C in a Perkin-Elmer system 2000 FTIR instrument equipped with a TGS detector. Spectral parameters: 54 scans; 4 cm−1 resolution; 0.2 cm/s optical path difference velocity; Kaiser-Bessel apodization. Protein spectra were obtained by sequential digital subtraction of the buffer and water vapor spectra. The buffer spectrum subtraction was factored to flatten the base line between 1800 and 2300 cm−1. The water vapor subtraction was factored to minimize water vapor bands in the in 1750–1850 cm−1 region. Prior to calculation of the second derivative spectra, the spectra were subjected to a nine-point Savitsky-Golay smoothing. Estimation of secondary structure compositions was done as reported previously by comparing the integrated areas of the negative peaks assigned to given secondary structures in the second derivative spectra (10Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 29Dong A. Huang P. Caughey W.S.

Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). PrP-res was purified from the brains of hamsters infected with the HY, DY, and 263K TSE strains by detergent extraction and differential ultracentrifugation. Analysis by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or immunoblotting indicated that the three major bands were of similar size among the TSE strains prior to PK treatment. However, PK treatment of the DY PrP-res generated three resistant PrP core fragments in the 19–29-kDa range that migrated slightly faster (∼2 kDa lower in apparent molecular mass) than the corresponding PK-treated HY and 263K PrP-res bands (Fig. 1). The observed difference between DY and HY PrP-res was most obvious when the PrP-res samples were deglycosylated with peptidyl-N-glycanase F (Fig. 1 B, lanes 10 and 11), and these findings were consistent with previous reports (13Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In addition, a broad PK-resistant band migrating near the dye front (apparent molecular mass, ∼7 kDa) was usually observed in DY PrP-res samples and to a lesser extent in 263K and HY PrP-res (for indication of extremes of variation compare Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–9). However, variations in the relative intensity of this band did not noticeably affect the FTIR spectra described below. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the ∼19–30-kDa bands and a portion of the ∼7-kDa PrP-res band were both immunoreactive with antiserum directed toward the C-terminal end (residues 220–233) of PrP (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–9). The ∼7-kDa species was labeled only very weakly, if at all, with an antiserum directed toward a central region of PrP (i.e. amino acid residues 143–156) (Fig. 1 B, lanes 12–14), and not labeled with a monoclonal antibody (3F4) recognizing amino acid residues 109–112 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–6), indicating that it is derived primarily from the C-terminal portion of PrP. This low molecular mass band was not detected on immunoblots developed with the C-terminal antibody when the PrP-res was deglycosylated, indicating that these C-terminal fragments contained N-linked glycans and that without them, the polypeptide fragments were too small (<∼6 kDa) to resolve on the gel. The observation that the PK-treated HY and 263K PrP-res fragments migrated similarly to one another in SDS-PAGE but differently from the DY PrP-res fragments suggested that the DY PrP-res conformation differed from the other two. To further compare the conformations of these different types of hamster PrP-res, we analyzed multiple PK-treated and non-PK-treated PrP-res preparations from each strain by FTIR. Transmission FTIR spectra of the PrP-res preparations were obtained after sequential subtraction of buffer and water vapor spectra. Representative primary spectra are shown in Fig. 2. To better resolve the absorbance bands comprising the primary spectra, deconvolution (Fig. 3) and second derivative calculations (Fig. 4) were performed. In second derivative spectra, negative bands were obtained that correspond in wave number to positive absorbance maxima in the primary or deconvoluted spectra. The reproducibilities of the spectra are shown by overlaying second derivative spectra from independent preparations. Using this approach, the secondary structure of PrP-res molecules derived from the same PrP-sen primary sequence but having distinct conformations were distinguished. The region of protein FTIR spectra that is most informative regarding conformation is the amide I region from ∼1600–1700 cm−1, which is dominated by the absorption of the carbonyls in amino acyl linkages of the polypeptide backbone. The frequency of the absorption of a given carbonyl is modulated by the secondary structure in which it resides (for reviews see Refs. 30Dong A. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar and 31Fink A. Folding Design. 1997; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). The FTIR spectra of the PK-treated 263K and HY PrP-res were similar; major bands were found at 1626, 1636, and 1657 cm−1 that were visible as absorbance maxima or shoulders in the primary spectra but were emphasized as positive absorbance maxima in the deconvoluted spectra (Fig. 3) and as negative bands in the second derivative spectra (Fig. 4). The bands at 1626 and 1636 cm−1 are indicative of β-sheet, and the 1657 cm−1 band is generally assigned to α-helix. Another β-sheet band, at 1694–1695 cm−1, was more intense in the HY spectra than in the 263K spectra.Figure 3Resolution-enhanced, Fourier self-deconvoluted (for review see Ref. 30Dong A.

Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4); the peak bands at 1626 and 1636 cm−1 characteristic of HY and 263K PrP-res were not present in the DY spectra, but prominent bands at 1616, 1629–1630, and 1694–1695 cm−1 were observed. The 1629-cm−1band was restricted to the DY spectrum, but the 1616- and 1695-cm−1 bands were also present at lower intensity in the HY spectra. Because absorbances in the 1616–1636 cm−1region of the protein infrared spectrum are usually attributed to β-sheets (30Dong A. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 31Fink A. Folding Design. 1997; 3: R9-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the strain-dependent conformational differences are associated with β-sheet secondary structures. This difference in conformation likely involves most, if not all, of the β-sheet secondary structures, because the bands at 1626 or 1636 cm−1 of HY and 263K PrP-res were not evident in the deconvoluted or second derivative DY PrP-res spectra, and conversely, there was no evidence of the 1629 cm−1 band in the HY or 263K PrP-res spectra. These spectral differences provide physical evidence that DY PrP-res has a distinct conformation from HY and 263K PrP-res even though they are derived from PrP-sen molecules with identical primary structures. The second derivative spectra of the non-PK-treated PrP-res preparations showed greater heterogeneity within a single strain compared with FTIR spectra from PK-treated PrP-res samples, especially in the regions containing absorbances from turns and unordered structures (∼1650–1654 and 1660–1685 cm−1, respectively) (Fig. 4). Despite this variability, the differences in the β-sheet regions of the FTIR spectra were consistent among the TSE strains in both non-PK-treated and PK-treated PrP-res samples. Thus, the strain-specific conformational difference was intrinsic to the PrP-res samples both before and after PK treatment. Secondary structure content of PrP-res was estimated by comparing the relative integrated intensities of bands in the second derivative spectra (10Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 30Dong A. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The secondary structure compositions of HY, DY, and 263K PrP-res preparations both before and after PK treatment indicated that each had a high β-sheet content (∼50% before PK treatment and ∼61% after) relative to α-helix (∼12% before PK treatment and ∼19% after) (Table I). PK treatment decreased the amount of turn and undefined secondary structure and increased the relative proportions of both β-sheet and α-helix. No significant differences in secondary structure composition were observed among the PrP-res preparations from the different TSE strains. These results provide physical evidence that DY PrP-res differs from HY and 263K PrP-res in the character rather than the proportion of β-sheet structures.Table IEstimated secondary structure compositions of 263K, HY, and DY PrP-resUntreatedPK-treated263KHYDY263KHYDY% ± S.D.β-Sheet (1616–1636 and 1695 cm−1)51 ± 251 ± 250 ± 159 ± 461 ± 259 ± 2α-Helix (1655–1657 cm−1)14 ± 312 ± 314 ± 116 ± 217 ± 219 ± 3Turns + undefined (1660–1685 and 1640–1650 cm−1)34 ± 737 ± 436 ± 222 ± 122 ± 421 ± 1 Open table in a new tab In this study we used infrared spectroscopy to demonstrate that types of PrP-res associated with distinct hamster TSE strains can have different conformations even though they are derived from PrP-sen with the same amino acid sequence. The HY and 263K PrP-res spectra were nearly indistinguishable but differed from DY PrP-res, principally in absorbances related to β-sheet structures. As reported previously, DY PrP-res had a distinct pattern of PK cleavage among the strain-associated PrP-res molecules in the 19–30-kDa size range (13Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but we now report that an additional glycosylated ∼7-kDa fragment from near the C terminus of PrP-res was also found at higher levels in DY PrP-res compared with HY or 263K PrP-res after PK treatment. These distinguishing physical and biochemical properties of DY PrP-res could encode the distinct phenotypic properties of DY TME, which is characterized by incubation periods of 6 months, a progressive lethargy, and prominent PrP-res deposits along white matter tracts in the brain (18Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, the similarity of the FTIR spectra and PK cleavage patterns of PrP-res between the HY and 263K strains were consistent with this alternative strain-associated conformation of PrP-res having a role in determining the biological properties of these shorter incubation TSE pathogens that cause hyperexcitability, ataxia, and a widespread distribution of PrP-res in the brain gray matter (18Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our findings, we propose that HY TME is an independent reisolation of the well studied 263K scrapie strain and, more importantly, that the clinicopathological phenotypes of these hamster TSE strains are causally linked to conformational differences in PrP-res. The FTIR spectrum of DY PrP-res differed most prominently from those of HY and 263K PrP-res in the region that is typically dominated by β-sheet absorbances of proteins. The difference was in the type rather than the proportion of β-sheet because HY and 263K PrP-res were characterized by major bands at 1626 and 1636 cm−1, and DY PrP-res was characterized by an absorbance band at ∼1629 cm−1, whereas the percentage of β-sheet was similar for each strain-associated PrP-res (Table I). The frequencies of absorption of β-sheet carbonyls can be modulated by several factors, including strength/length of hydrogen-bonding, distortions of sheet structure, solvent exposure, and the dielectric constant of the immediate environment (32Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar). Thus, DY PrP-res may be unique in the pattern of intramolecular or intermolecular hydrogen bonds linking β-strands or in the exposure of its β-sheet structures to the aqueous medium or a strain-specific ligand(s). Other differences among the TSE strains in the FTIR spectra assigned to β-sheet were found at 1616 and 1695 cm−1; these bands were more intense in the DY spectra compared with HY and 263K PrP-res, and in each case, the intensity of these bands was proportional within a given spectrum. Increases in the intensities of bands with similar wave numbers has been observed in proteins that have been induced to aggregate by thermal denaturation and have been ascribed to intermolecular antiparallel β-sheets in protein aggregates (for review see Ref. 30Dong A. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The presence of these bands is consistent with the aggregated nature of PrP-res; however, the fact that these bands were usually lacking in 263K PrP-res spectra indicates that these structural features associated with the 1616 and 1695 cm−1 bands are not present in all types of PrP-res. Furthermore, we have observed prominent bands at 1616 and 1690 cm−1 (but not within the region from 1626–1636 cm−1) in aggregates of recombinant PrP expressed in Escherichia coli that is PK-sensitive and noninfectious, 2B. Caughey and G. Raymond, unpublished observations. indicating that the associated conformational features are not restricted to PK-resistant and TSE-associated forms of PrP. The fact that PK treatment reduced the intensities of FTIR absorbance bands associated with disordered and turn structures is consistent with previous demonstrations that the N-terminal portion of PrP-res molecules removed by PK consists of undefined and extended/turn secondary structures (33Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 34Smith C.J. Drake A.F. Banfield B.A. Bloomberg G.B. Palmer M.S. Clarke A.R. Collinge J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The observation that PK digestion did not eliminate the β-sheet bands or alter their wave numbers (1616–1636 and 1695 cm−1) indicates that the structures responsible for these bands are in the PK-resistant C-terminal part of the molecule. Although the high resolution structure of PrP-res is not known, it is clear that it has more β-sheet content than PrP-sen (10Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S.

Furthermore,in vitro studies have demonstrated that PrP-res aggregates can induce the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res by a mechanism that results in the inclusion of the conversion product in the PrP-res aggregate, as is the case with amyloid formation by other proteins (35Kocisko D.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15227-15231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This has been hypothesized to be a nucleated polymerization mechanism whereby pre-existing PrP-res polymers or oligomers acts as seeds for the recruitment and conformational conversion of PrP-sen into additional PrP-res (35Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Our previous demonstration that HY and DY PrP-res induce the conversion of hamster PrP-sen to strain-specific conversion products in vitro led us to propose that different self-propagating conformers and/or packing arrangements of PrP-res seeds could act as different TSE agent strains in the same host species (14Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The present study provides additional support for this concept by showing the first direct spectroscopic evidence that PrP-res can adopt different strain-associated secondary structures from the same PrP-sen molecule. The ability of FTIR to detect these conformational differences in PrP-res suggests that it may be a rapid method for TSE strain typing. The existence of distinct strain-dependent conformations of PrP-res of a given amino acid sequence is consistent with the hypothesis that conformational diversity of PrP-res could account at least in part for TSE strain diversity (13Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). These different conformations may affect interactions of PrP-res with PrP-sen and/or other factors in host cells in a way that differentially affects pathogenesis. For instance, differences in the stability, targeting, self-propagating activities, or toxicities of HY and DY PrP-res could affect their rates and sites of accumulation in the brain, their neuropathic effects, and ultimately, the incubation periods and clinical manifestations of their respective infections. This view must be tempered by the uncertainty as to whether PrP-res is, in and of itself, the infectious agent and whether conformational variation of PrP-res is a cause or an effect of TSE strain characteristics in vivo. Nonetheless the present results, by demonstrating that different strain-associated conformers of PrP-res exist, is consistent with the view that the self-propagation of conformational variants of PrP-res plays a role in TSE strain diversity.

In addition to an MDR-like core, MRP1 contains an N-terminal membrane-bound region (TMD0) connected to the core by a cytoplasmic linker (L0). We have studied truncated MRP1 versions containing either the MDR-like core alone or the core plus linker L0, produced in the baculovirus-insect (Sf9) cell system. Their function was examined in isolated membrane vesicles. Full-length MRP1 showed ATP-dependent, vanadate-sensitive accumulation of leukotriene C4 and N-ethylmaleimide glutathione. In addition, leukotriene C4-stimulated, vanadate-dependent nucleotide occlusion was detected. The MDR-like core was virtually inactive. Co-expression of the core with the N-terminal region including L0 fully restored MRP1 function. Unexpectedly, a truncated MRP1 mutant lacking the entire TMD0 region but still containing L0 behaved like wild-type MRP1 in vesicle uptake and nucleotide trapping experiments. We also expressed the MRP1 constructs in polarized canine kidney derived MDCKII cells. Like wild-type MRP1, the MRP1 protein without the TMD0 region was routed to the lateral plasma membrane and transported dinitrophenyl glutathione and daunorubicin. The TMD0L0 and the MRP1 minus TMD0L0 remained in an intracellular compartment. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that the TMD0 region is neither required for the transport function of MRP1 nor for its proper routing to the plasma membrane.

MDR1 P-glycoprotein (MDR1 Pgp)1 and MRP1 (multidrug resistance protein 1) are members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family that can cause multiple drug resistance in tumor cells. MDR1 Pgp is an ATP-dependent drug extrusion pump and confers resistance to a wide variety of hydrophobic toxic agents (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev.

Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), similarly to what has been shown for hydrophobic drugs in the case of MDR1 Pgp (15Szabó K. Welker E. Bakos É. Müller M.

Vanadate-dependent, drug-stimulated nucleotide trapping reflects a partial reaction of the multidrug transporters and thus can be used to examine their functional characteristics. MDR1 Pgp and MRP1 share a similar core structure, consisting of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and cytoplasmic ABC-containing regions. However, MRP1 and several homologues form a subfamily of ABC transporters, characterized by a triple membrane-bound domain structure (16Tusnády G.E. Bakos É. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 17Bakos É. Hegedûs T. Holló Z. Welker E. Tusnády G.E. Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

These include an MDR-like core region containing two ABC units and two membrane-bound domains (TMD1 and TMD2) and an N-terminal polypeptide region of about 280 amino acids, forming a membrane-bound domain and a cytoplasmic loop (TMD0 and L0; see Fig. 1). Limited proteolysis, glycosylation, and epitope insertion experiments with MRP1 indicate that the TMD0 domain of MRP1 contains five transmembrane helices and that the N terminus of the protein is extracytosolic (17Bakos É. Hegedûs T. Holló Z. Welker E. Tusnády G.E. Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggesting that these proteins evolved from a common ancestral gene. Covalent linkage of the individual domains of ABC transporters may not be essential for function, as has been demonstrated by proteolytic cleavage or separate expression of N-terminal and C-terminal halves (21Gao M.

MRP1 mutants expressed in insect cells without the N-terminal TMD0 and L0 linker region were nonfunctional, whereas co-expression of the N-terminal TMD0L0 region with the C-terminal core reconstituted a functional LTC4 transporter (23Gao M.

To further examine the role of the N-terminal regions in the function of MRP1, we have constructed the genetically engineered MRP1 variants shown in Fig. 1. Constructs were expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells and in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells. We show here that the TMD0 is neither required for function of MRP1 nor for routing the protein to the basolateral plasma membrane in polarized mammalian cells. MRP1 cDNA was removed from modified pJ3Ω-MRP (17Bakos É. Hegedûs T. Holló Z. Welker E. Tusnády G.E. Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

LinkerI (GATCTGCTAGCTTAACTAGTCCGGCATGGCA) was inserted into the uniqueBamHI site of pAcSG2MRP (at nucleotide 840 in the MRP1 cDNA). To generate the TMD0L0 construct (encoding amino acids 1–281 + LLA + stop), pAcSG2MRPlinkerI was digested with SpeI within the linker and withXbaI at position −5. The fragment was subcloned into pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen). To generate ΔMRP (encoding amino acids MA + 281–1531), the SpeI-NotI fragment was removed from pAcSG2MRPlinkerI and subcloned into pVL1393. To obtain the TMD0 (encoding amino acids 1–203 + LG + stop) and L0ΔMRP (amino acids MAL + 204–1531) constructs, the SalI-BamHI fragment was removed from the original pJ3Ω-MRP and subcloned into M13mp18, yielding M13SBMRP. A new XbaI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at position 606, then the LinkerII (CTAGGCTAGCCGGCATGGCA), including a stop codon, an NheI site, and a Kozak sequence, was inserted into the generated XbaI site. ADraIII-BamHI fragment (nucleotides 87–840) was removed from the pAcSG2MRP and substituted with theDraIII-BamHI insert of M13SBMRP containing linkerII, yielding pAcSG2MRPlinkerII. TheNheI-NotI fragment of this construct was subcloned into pVL1393 to generate L0ΔMRP; theXbaI-NheI fragment (nucleotides −5–619) was subcloned into pVL1393 to obtain TMD0. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by using the BaculoGold transfection kit (PharMingene). Culturing and infection of Sf9 cells and the preparation and storage of membranes was as described (25Sarkadi B. Price E.M. Boucher R.C. Germann U.A. Scarborough G.A. J. Biol.

For expression of MRP1 variants in kidney-derived MDCKII cells, all cDNAs were inserted as blunt-end fragments into the retroviral vector pCMV-neo as described (26Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L.

MRP1 was removed from pJ3Ω-MRP1 as aSalI-NotI fragment, TMD0L0 as a XbaI-SpeI fragment from pAcSG2MRPlinkerI, L0ΔMRP as aNheI-NotI fragment from pAcSG2MRPlinkerII, and ΔMRP as a SpeI-NotI fragment from pAcSG2MRPlinkerI.

[3H]LTC4 (135 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products, and 45Ca (0.8 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [3H]NEM-GS was prepared from [3H]NEM (60 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) by mixing the isotope in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) with freshly dissolved GSH in a 1:1.1 molar ratio. For [3H]NEM-GS and [3H]LTC4transport measurements, isolated membranes (200 μg of protein) were incubated in the presence of 4 mm ATP or AMP in 500 μl of transport buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl) at 23 °C (LTC4) or at 37 °C (NEM-GS). 100-μl aliquots of this suspension were added to 1 ml of ice-cold transport buffer at the time points indicated and subsequently filtered rapidly through nitrocellulose membranes (0.25-μm pore size). The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of cold transport buffer, and filter-bound radioactivity was measured in scintillation fluid (Optifluor, Packard). ATP-dependent transport was calculated by subtracting the activity values obtained with AMP from those in the presence of ATP. ATP-dependent 45Ca uptake was measured by rapid filtration of the vesicles, as in Ref. 27Sarkadi B. Enyedi Á. Földes-Papp Z. Gárdos G. J. Biol.

For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were grown on microporous polycarbonate filters (3-μm pore size, 24.5-mm diameter, TranswellTM 3414; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a density of 2 × 106 cells/well or on microscope slides for 3 days. No difference was observed between the two procedures. Subsequent antibody incubations and examination of the cells were as described before (28Evers R. Zaman G.J. van Deemter L. Janssen H.

Immunoblotting and detection of human MRP1 with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) MRPr1 and MRPm6 were performed as described (29Flens M.J. Izquerido M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J.L.M.

Transport of [14C]dinitrophenyl S-glutathione ([14C]DNP-GS) and of daunorubicin were carried out as described (26Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C.

To clarify the possible functional role of both the TMD0 and the L0 regions in MRP1, two different truncated versions of MRP1 were constructed (see Fig. 1): ΔMRP (amino acids 281–1531), which contains the MDR-like core region, and L0ΔMRP (amino acids 204–1531), containing the core region and most of the L0 linker region. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the N-terminal regions among the members of the MRP subfamily showed a relatively low level of identity (16Tusnády G.E. Bakos É. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) but revealed a relatively strongly conserved peptide segment in the N-terminal part of the cytoplasmic linker region (see also Ref. 18Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 193-204Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus L0ΔMRP was designed to contain an N terminus with the uninterrupted form of this conserved segment. The complementing N-terminal peptides of both truncated MRP1 versions were also generated: TMD0L0 (amino acids 1–281) contains the membrane-bound domain and the major part of the connecting cytoplasmic region, whereas TMD0 (amino acids 1–203) contains only the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). The full-length human MRP1 and its truncated versions were expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, and the amounts of the proteins produced were studied in isolated membrane preparations. Fig. 2 demonstrates the immunoblot detection of the MRP1 variants by two mAbs: MRPr1 and MRPm6. The epitope for MRPr1 has recently been mapped to amino acids 238–247 (30Hipfner, D. R., Gao, M., Scheffer, G., Scheper, R. J., Deeley, R. G., and Cole, S. P. C (1998) Br. J. Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar), whereas MRPm6 recognizes amino acids 1511–1520 (30Hipfner, D. R., Gao, M., Scheffer, G., Scheper, R. J., Deeley, R. G., and Cole, S. P. C (1998) Br. J. Cancer, in pressGoogle Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, mAb MRPr1 recognizes full-length MRP1, L0ΔMRP, and TMD0L0, whereas ΔMRP is not detected by this antibody. MRPm6, as expected, reacts with MRP1, ΔMRP, and L0ΔMRP but not with TMD0L0. Because we have no relevant antibody for the detection of TMD0, we did not use this construct in the present experiments. As shown before (17Bakos É. Hegedûs T. Holló Z. Welker E. Tusnády G.E. Zaman G.J.R. Flens M.J. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

According to the immunoblots, the amount of MRP1 in Sf9 cell membranes was about five times higher than in a membrane preparation isolated from the highly drug-resistant HL60-MRP1 cell line. The expression level of the various truncated constructs was similar to that of MRP1. When the complementing peptides were co-expressed by virus co-infection, care was taken to use baculovirus ratios that produced a maximum level of co-expression for both the core and N-terminal regions (we found that a higher titer of the viruses directing the expression of the smaller N-terminal regions suppressed the expression of the core). The data shown in Fig. 2 indicate that all the MRP1 variants were efficiently produced in the Sf9 cells. Slight variations in the expression levels of these variants between various membrane preparations were still observed. The transport data were therefore corrected for the protein levels (see below). In the following experiments we have examined the function of MRP1 and its truncated versions by measuring the transport of the established MRP1 substrates, LTC4 and NEM-GS (see 2, 3, 7). To determine the transport function of the various MRP1 constructs, we estimated the relative amount of transport-competent inside-out vesicles in the Sf9 membrane preparations. For this purpose, we measured the rate of endogenous ATP-dependent calcium uptake in each preparation, which was found to be between 0.5–1.5 nmol mg−1 min−1. In all further experiments the LTC4 and NEM-GS transport rates were corrected for the mean relative vesicle contents. When comparing the transport rates by the truncated MRP1 constructs, we also corrected these rates by their relative expression levels, as determined by immunoblotting. Fig. 3 (panels A and B) demonstrate the time course of tritiated LTC4(50 nm) and NEM-GS (50 μm) uptake in Sf9 membrane vesicles containing human MRP1 variants or β-galactosidase. As shown, full-length MRP1 gave an ATP-dependent increase in vesicular accumulation of radioactivity that was linear for LTC4 for about 30 s at 23 °C and for NEM-GS for about 3 min at 37 °C. The initial rate of ATP-dependent LTC4 transport in MRP1-containing membranes was about 50 pmol mg−1min−1, whereas that of the NEM-GS transport was about 160 pmol mg−1 min−1 under these conditions. Rapid washing of the vesicles with cold substrate-containing solutions did not alter the vesicular LTC4 and NEM-GS levels, whereas the addition of concentrated sucrose (final concentration 1 m) or low concentrations of Triton X-100 (0.02%) to the media eliminated ATP-dependent tracer accumulation. As shown in Table I, LTC4uptake by MRP1-containing membrane vesicles was strongly inhibited by NEM-GS and NEM-GS uptake by LTC4, whereas the uptake of both compounds was abolished by sodium orthovanadate, oxidized glutathione (GSSG), or sulfinpyrazone (an inhibitor of organic anion transporters (7Holló Zs.

A partial inhibition of LTC4 and NEM-GS uptake was observed by calcein-AM and a high concentration of vinblastine, whereas 5-fluorouracil had no inhibitory effect.Table IEffects of various compounds on ATP-dependent LTC4and NEM-GS uptake in Sf9 cell membrane vesicles containing MRP1 and its truncated versionsInhibitorConcentrationLTC4uptakeNEM-GS uptakeMRPL0ΔMRPTMD0L0 + ΔMRPMRPL0ΔMRPTMD0L0 + ΔMRPμm% of control% of controlVanadate2,00012568210LTC40.6171713NEM-GS600331GSSG600922191217Sulfinpyrazone800000000Calcein-AM100435343283432Vinblastine2005246453535375-Fluorouracil300919594928597Sf9 membrane vesicles were incubated with 3 nmLTC4 at 23 °C for 30 s or with 5 μmNEM-GS at 37 °C for 3 min.

Tracer uptake was measured by rapid filtration, and the respective transport rates were expressed as percent of the tracer uptake measured in the absence of inhibitors. The values in this table represent means of triplicate determinations. The TMD0L0 part of MRP1 did not evoke any additional transport activity compared with that seen in the control, β-galactosidase-containing vesicles. Vesicles containing ΔMRP showed an LTC4 and NEM-GS uptake of about 10% that of wild-type MRP1 (5 and 12 pmol mg−1 min−1, respectively). Interestingly, the co-expression of ΔMRP and TMD0L0 resulted in somewhat higher uptake rates for LTC4 and NEM-GS (initial rates of about 60 and 210 pmol mg−1 min−1, respectively) than those catalyzed by intact MRP1. L0ΔMRP was found to induce a high level ATP-dependent transport activity for both substrates, with initial rates of about 35 pmol of LTC4mg−1 min−1 and 70 pmol of NEM-GS mg−1 min−1. In all cases vesicular tracer uptake was eliminated by the addition of 0.02% Triton X-100 or 1m sucrose. As shown in Table I, LTC4 and NEM-GS uptake in membrane vesicles containing ΔMRP and TMD0L0co-expressed or L0ΔMRP was vanadate-sensitive and inhibited by glutathione conjugates, sulfinpyrazone, and calcein-AM but not by 5-fluorouracil. The concentration dependence of the ATP-dependent LTC4 and NEM-GS transport was examined for all MRP1 variants. The double-reciprocal plots of these data are shown in Fig. 3 (panels C and D), and the results are summarized in Table II. In accordance with published data (4Jedlitschky G. Leier I. Buchholz U. Barnouin K. Kurz G. Keppler D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 988-994PubMed Google Scholar), the MRP1 K mvalue for ATP-dependent LTC4 transport was about 135 ± 35 nm, whereas that for NEM-GS was about 155 ± 40 μm. Co-expression of ΔMRP and TMD0L0 resulted in similarK m values and somewhat higherV max values for the ATP-dependent uptake of LTC4 and NEM-GS than those measured for full-length MRP1 (Table II).Table IIKinetic parameters of ATP-dependent LTC4 and NEM-GS uptake in Sf9 cell membrane vesicles containing MRP1 and its truncated versionsLTC4NEM-GSK mV maxK mV maxnmpmol mg−1min−1μmpmol mg−1 min−1MRP135 ± 35200 ± 20155 ± 40580 ± 60L0ΔMRP170 ± 40140 ± 30390 ± 95520 ± 50ΔMRP + TMD0L0140 ± 20270 ± 25150 ± 35750 ± 65Values represent means of five experiments ± S.D. Open table in a new tab Values represent means of five experiments ± S.D. As indicated in Fig. 3 and Table II, the K m and V max values for LTC4 transport were only slightly different in membranes containing L0ΔMRP than in membranes containing MRP1. Differences were within the range of experimental error. In the case of NEM-GS uptake by L0ΔMRP, the V max was again similar, but the K m value was significantly higher (2.5-fold) than for full-length MRP1. These results indicate that the TMD0 region is not required for MRP1-mediated LTC4 or NEM-GS transport. Vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping of MRP1 reflects a partial reaction of the ATPase cycle of this protein, stimulated by the transported substrates (13Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J.

By using magnesium-8-azido-[32P]ATP a covalent photoaffinity labeling of the MRP1 variants could also be achieved. Fig. 4 shows the nucleotide trapping by MRP1, which was 2–3-fold stimulated by 600 nm LTC4and fully inhibitable by pretreatment with 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping by MRP1 was also stimulated by 1 mm NEM-GS (data not shown). In control membranes containing β-galactosidase, the low level background labeling of some endogenous proteins was not influenced by any of the MRP1 substrates (data not shown). In contrast, ΔMRP did not measurably trap nucleotide either in the presence or absence of LTC4, even if longer incubation periods (20 min) were applied. However, co-expression of ΔMRP with TMD0L0 resulted in NEM-sensitive, LTC4-stimulated nucleotide trapping in the protein band representing ΔMRP. Also, in membranes containing L0ΔMRP, clear NEM-inhibitable nucleotide trapping was detected in the relevant protein band, and the addition of LTC4 significantly increased the amount of trapping by this MRP1 mutant (Fig. 4). We have previously shown that MDCKII cells stably expressing human MRP1 can be generated by transducing these cells with a retroviral construct containing MRP1 cDNA (26Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Evers R. Cnubben N.H. Wijnholds J. van Deemter L. van Bladeren P.J. Borst P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Using the same procedure, we generated MDCKII cells stably expressing ΔMRP, TMD0L0, and L0ΔMRP. By Western blot analysis of crude cell extracts, using the same antibodies as in Fig. 2, we identified several clones that produced substantial amounts of the MRP1 variants (Fig. 5,A and B). At the exposure time shown, no signal was detectable with mAb MRPm6 and MRPr1 in wild-type MDCKII cells. The TMD0L0 protein appeared as a smear around 49 kDa in these cells. As two of the functional MRP1 glycosylation sites are present in this fragment (19Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), this might be explained by partial glycosylation of this protein and/or partial degradation. Intact MRP1 is localized in the lateral plasma membrane in polarized LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells (28Evers R. Zaman G.J. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Borst P.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of the MRP1 mutants was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy in cells growing in a monolayer. The wild-type MRP1, TMD0L0, and L0ΔMRP proteins were detected with mAb MRPr1, and the ΔMRP protein was detected with mAb MRPm6. Localization was examined at the horizontal plane and at the plane perpendicular to the monolayer (Fig. 6). The results can be summarized as follows. (i) Some of the L0ΔMRP protein was detected intracellularly, but a substantial amount was present in the lateral membranes, (ii) the TMD0L0 protein was present in large intracellular vesicles, and (iii) the ΔMRP protein was present in a relatively low concentration and was detected intracellularly. In some cells a concentration of signal was detected at the position of the lateral membrane, but this was only seen in a small fraction of the cells analyzed. We have shown before that the transport activity of MRP1 can be studied in polarized cells using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitro[14C]benzene (28Evers R. Zaman G.J. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Borst P. Schinkel A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic compound rapidly diffuses over membranes and is conjugated intracellularly to GSH by glutathione S-transferases. The resulting hydrophilic [14C]DNP-GS can only leave the cell by carrier-mediated transport. Transport across the apical and basolateral plasma membrane can be distinguished by growing cells as a monolayer on a porous membrane. The [14C]DNP-GS transport by polarized monolayers of the various MDCKII-derived clones is presented in Fig. 7. The MDCKII-TMD0L0 cells were not tested in transport assays as they lack the ABC domains that are required for transport activity. The MDCKII-ΔMRP cells transported similar amounts of DNP-GS as the parental cells. In contrast, both the MDCKII-MRP and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP cells demonstrated preferential transport to the basolateral compartment. The difference in transport activity between the cell lines could not be explained by a difference in capacity to synthesize DNP-GS, as the total amount of DNP-GS synthesized after 20 min was similar in all different clones (data not shown). The amount of radioactivity measured intracellularly in the MDCKII-MRP and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP was approximately 3-fold lower than in the parental cells, confirming the outward transport of DNP-GS by MRP1 and L0ΔMRP. Human MRP1 confers resistance to anthracyclines (24Zaman G.J. Flens M.J. van Leusden M.R. de Haas M. Mulder H.S. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M. Scheper R.J. Baas F. Broxterman H.J. Borst P. Proc. Natl.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that daunorubicin is transported to the basolateral side of LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing MRP1 (28Evers R. Zaman G.J. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Borst P. Schinkel A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These experiments could not simply be repeated with MDCKII cells, as these cells contain relatively high amounts of canine drug-transporting Pgp, resulting in high backgrounds in daunorubicin transport experiments. Fortunately, this background can be suppressed by low concentrations (0.1 μm) of the Pgp inhibitor PSC833, which have no significant effect on cMOAT (MRP2) in MDCKII-cMOAT cells (26Evers R. Kool M. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Paulusma C.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1310-1319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These conditions were also used to study the vectorial transport of daunorubicin by the MRP1 mutants. [3H]Daunorubicin was added either to the apical or to the basolateral side of a cell monolayer, and the accumulation of radioactivity in the opposite compartment was followed. Transport of [3H]daunorubicin in wild-type MDCKII cells was virtually blocked at the concentration of PSC833 used in the experiment. Relative to wild-type cells, the MDCKII-MRP and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP cells showed an increased basolateral transport activity (Fig. 8,left panels). No significant transport was observed in the MDCKII-ΔMRP cells (data not shown). As a control for an apical transporter, we used MDCKII cells retrovirally transduced with human MDR1 cDNA. These cells contain a relatively high concentration of MDR1 Pgp in their apical plasma membrane that is only partially inhibited by the low concentration of PSC833 used in these experiments (see Fig. 5 C). 2R. Evers and P. Borst, unpublished data. As expected these cells transported daunorubicin at high rate toward the apical side of the monolayer. Sulfinpyrazone inhibits MRP1 in intact pig kidney cells (28Evers R. Zaman G.J. van Deemter L. Janssen H. Calafat J. Oomen L.C. Oude Elferink R.P. Borst P. Schinkel A.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1211-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and in Sf9-derived vesicles (Table I). Fig. 8 (right panels) shows that 1 mm sulfinpyrazone also blocks transport to the basolateral side in MDCKII-MRP and MDCKII-L0 ΔMRP cells, whereas transport in MDCKII-MDR1 cells was not affected. As a control, a high concentration of PSC833 (5 μm) was used. This concentration blocked daunorubicin transport in the MDCKII-MDR1 cells. As high concentrations of PSC833 are known to inhibit MRP1 (2Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27807-27810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also some inhibition of transport in MDCKII-MRP and MDCKII-L0ΔMRP was observed (Fig. 8, middle panels). Our results suggest that the cytoplasmic L0 linker of MRP1 (amino acids 204–281) forms a functional domain that is essential and sufficient for promoting substrate transport. In contrast, the N-terminal putative membrane-bound TMD0 (amino acids 1–203) region is neither required for transport of organic anions and of daunorubicin, as shown in Sf9 and mammalian cells, nor is it required for directing the protein toward the lateral plasma membrane in polarized MDCKII cells. Both the glutathione conjugate transport and the vanadate-dependent nucleotide trapping experiments suggest that the MDR-like core of MRP1 in Sf9 cells is virtually inactive as a transporter. Still, by interacting with the complementing N-terminal region, the core regains full transport activity, confirming and extending the results of Gao et al. (23Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Gao et al. (23Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) found that removal of the whole TMD0 domain or only its first N-terminal transmembrane helix abolished MRP1 function. This led these authors to conclude that the entire TMD0L0 region is essential for transport activity. In contrast, our results show that the L0ΔMRP protein is fully functional and also properly routed to the lateral membrane of polarized mammalian cells. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the L0ΔMRP construct we generated encodes a protein that is 25 amino acids longer at its N terminus than the construct used by Gao et al.(23Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This region encompasses a stretch of amino acids that is conserved among the members of the MRP family (18Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 193-204Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and that could be essential for MRP1 substrate recognition or for the integrity of the L0 segment as a functional domain. It is not obvious why the construct of Gao et al. (23Gao M. Yamazaki M. Loe D.W. Westlake C.J. Grant C.E. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10733-10740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) lacking only the first N-terminal transmembrane segment of TMD0 was also inactive. It seems possible, however, that the deletion of the first N-terminal transmembrane segment disturbs the structure of other neighboring membrane-associated regions and that this results in an inactive transporter molecule. The N-terminal TMD0 region is found in the human MRP family members MRP1, cMOAT (MRP2), MRP3, and MRP6, 3M. Kool, J. Wijnholds, and P. Borst, unpublished data. and although this region shows a low overall amino acid identity among these proteins, it is structurally conserved in evolution (16Tusnády G.E. Bakos É. Váradi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is therefore hard to believe that it would not be essential. Obviously, we cannot exclude that it plays a subtle role in the function of MRP1 that we missed in the experiments done thus far. For instance, the TMD0region could (i) have a regulatory role in the functional interaction of MRP1 with other membrane proteins, (ii) contribute to proper protein routing in other cells than kidney, (iii) be required for stabilization of the L0 region, and/or (iv) be important for the efficient transport of some substrates. This latter possibility derives some support from the higher K m value for NEM-GS obtained for L0ΔMRP than for wild-type MRP1 (Table II). A more detailed analysis will be required to define such a role for this domain. The routing signals that determine the lateral plasma membrane localization of MRP1 are not known yet. Our results clearly show, however, that the TMD0 region is not required, at least in kidney. We are currently testing the possibility that the L0 domain contains a dominant basolateral routing signal by fusing this domain to ABC transporters that are normally routed to the apical plasma membrane. Because the drug extrusion activity of MRP1 has a major role in the chemotherapy resistance of human tumors, the current demonstration of the function of the N-terminal cytoplasmic L0 domain may significantly help the design of efficient modulators or inhibitors for this clinically important protein.

Up-regulation of COX-2 is responsible for increased PG production in inflammation and is antagonized by corticosteriods such as dexamethasone. In human pulmonary A549 cells, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) increases prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis via dexamethasone-sensitive induction of COX-2. Nuclear run-off assays showed that COX-2 transcription rate was repressed 25–40% by dexamethasone, while PGE2 release, COX activity, and COX-2 protein were totally repressed. At the mRNA level, complete repression of COX-2 was only observed at later (6 h) time points. Preinduced COX-2 mRNA was also potently repressed by dexamethasone, yet suppression of transcription by actinomycin D showed little effect. This dexamethasone-dependent repression involved a reduced COX-2 mRNA half-life, was blocked by actinomycin D or cycloheximide, and was antagonized by the steroid antagonist RU38486. Repression of IL-1β-induced PGE2 release, COX activity, and COX-2 protein by actinomycin D was only effective within the first hour following IL-1β treatment, while dexamethasone was effective when added up to 10 h later, suggesting a functional role for post-transcriptional mechanisms of repression. Following dexamethasone treatment, shortening of the average length of COX-2 mRNA poly(A) tails was observed. Finally, ligation of the COX-2 3′-UTR to a heterologous reporter failed to confer dexamethasone sensitivity. In conclusion, these data indicate a major role for post-transcriptional mechanisms in the dexamethasone-dependent repression of COX-2 that require de novo glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription and translation. This mechanism involves shortening of the COX-2 poly(A) tail and requires determinants other than just the 3′-UTR for specificity.

Subsequently, cell-specific isomerases and reductases result in production of biologically relevant PGs. The two COX isoforms are encoded by distinct genes of which COX-1 is a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene and COX-2 shows low basal expression that is rapidly induced by inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli (1Smith W.L.

Pharmacologically, this pathway is important, since COX is the target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and indomethacin (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

The anti-inflammatory benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are thought to derive from inhibition of COX-2, while many of the undesirable side effects are due to COX-1 inhibition (1Smith W.L.

N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Synthetic glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, act by mimicking the natural steroid, cortisol, in binding the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). GR then disassociates from its cytoplasmic protein complex and translocates to the nucleus, where it can activate transcription (transactivation) of anti-inflammatory genes via cis-acting promoter elements known as glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) (7Beato M. Truss M. Chavez S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 784: 93-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, this fails to explain how glucocorticoids cause down-regulation of inflammatory genes such as COX-2. Other mechanisms for this effect may include transcriptional repression (transrepression) via negative GREs (8Drouin J. Sun Y.L. Chamberland M. Gauthier Y. De Lean A. Nemer M. Schmidt T.J.

Davies R.J. Respir. Med. 1993; 87: 405-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Airway epithelial cells respond to proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, by induction of COX-2 and PGE2 release (16Mitchell J.A. Belvisi M.G. Akarasereenont P. Robbins R.A. Kwon O.J. Croxtall J. Barnes P.J. Vane J.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This response is also observed in human A549 cells, and in both cases the response is suppressed by dexamethasone (16Mitchell J.A. Belvisi M.G. Akarasereenont P. Robbins R.A. Kwon O.J. Croxtall J.

We have therefore used these cells to examine the mechanisms of dexamethasone repression of IL-1β-dependent induction of COX-2 and relate these effects to functional changes in released PGE2.DISCUSSIONRepression of gene expression by activated GR accounts for two major functions of glucocorticoids, namely classical negative feedback of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and immunosuppression. Clinically, the immunosuppressive nature of glucocorticoids is important in the treatment of inflammatory disease by down-regulating expression of many proinflammatory genes (6Barnes P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 868-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). One target of glucocorticoid repression is COX-2, whose expression is responsible for inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis and plays a major role in inflammation (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M.

Cytokine-induced COX-2 and PG synthesis is strongly repressed by dexamethasone in a number of experimental systems; however, the molecular basis for this effect is presently unclear (16Mitchell J.A.

J. 1996; 318: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).Two mechanisms of glucocorticoid-mediated repression that have recently received much attention are those involving suppression of AP-1 and NF-κB-dependent transcription (9Yang Yen H.F.

Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter analyses in nonhuman cells have previously identified the NF-κB, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and cAMP response element sites as important in induction of COX-2 in response to phorbol esters, lipopolysaccharide, and tumor necrosis factor-α (37Inoue H. Yokoyama C. Hara S. Tone Y. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24965-24971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 38Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Since AP-1 components, for example c-Jun, can activate transcription via the COX-2 cAMP response element (39Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), this site may provide sensitivity to dexamethasone. Furthermore, involvement of NF-κB in the transcriptional control of COX-2 is also suggested in human cells, including A549 cells where overexpression of NF-κB subunits activates the COX-2 promoter (22Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 40Roshak A.K. Jackson J.R. McGough K. Chabot-Fletcher M.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Analysis of COX-2 transcription rate indicated dexamethasone-dependent repression of between 30 and 40%, suggesting a partial role for GR-mediated transrepression in this system. Interestingly, these data are consistent with the fact that NF-κB-dependent transcription from a κB-dependent reporter stably transfected in A549 cells also showed 30–40% repression by dexamethasone (42Newton R. Hart L.A. Stevens D.A. Bergmann M. Donnelly L.E. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since GR-dependent transrepression of AP-1 and NF-κB involves direct interactions between pre-existing proteins, there is no requirement for protein synthesis, so repression would be expected to occur even in the presence of cycloheximide (13Ray A. Prefontaine K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 43Jonat C. Rahmsdorf H.J. Park K.K. Cato A.C. Gebel S. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1189-1204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Thus, the 35–40% repression of COX-2 mRNA observed in the presence of cycloheximide further substantiates these transcriptional effects.The fact that COX-2 transcription rate was only reduced by a maximum of 40%, while repression of COX-2 protein and mRNA (at 6 h) was complete indicates that other, post-transcriptional, mechanisms of repression must also exist. This was confirmed by the addition of dexamethasone to cells that had been preinduced with IL-1β. In this case, dexamethasone resulted in total loss of preformed COX-2 mRNA within 6 h, presumably while COX-2 transcription was still occurring at up to 60% of the IL-1β-induced level. This contrasted with total inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D, which had little effect on preformed COX-2 mRNA levels. Furthermore, the dexamethasone-dependent repression took place after a lag of almost 2 h, suggesting the need for new transcription and translation. This was confirmed by the ability of actinomycin D and cycloheximide to block the dexamethasone effect.In addition, the steroid antagonist, RU38486, also inhibited the dexamethasone-dependent repression, yet showed little repressive effect by itself. This is explained by RU38486 being an effective antagonist and only a weak agonist of GR-dependent transactivation (26Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche-Rigon M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 28Liden J. Delaunay F. Rafter I. Gustafsson J.-A. Okret S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Yet in AP-1 transrepression assays, RU38486 showed much of the activity of dexamethasone (26Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche-Rigon M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 44Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), while in NF-κB transrepression assays significant transrepression by RU38486 was also observed (14Scheinman R.I. Gualberto A. Jewell C.M. Cidlowski J.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 943-953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Liden J. Delaunay F. Rafter I. Gustafsson J.-A. Okret S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21467-21472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Taken together, this information, along with the actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and RU38486 data reported here, indicates a major role for post-transcriptional mechanisms in the dexamethasone-dependent repression of COX-2 mRNA. This mechanism (or mechanisms) requires GR-mediated transactivation, which leads to de novo transcription and translation of genes that either directly or indirectly suppress COX-2 mRNA levels.To evaluate the functional significance of these effects, we examined the ability of dexamethasone and actinomycin D to inhibit COX-2 protein, COX activity, and PGE2 release when added with or after IL-1β. To our surprise, actinomycin D was only effective in suppressing these indicators of COX induction when added with IL-1β or within the first hour of IL-1β treatment, whereas dexamethasone effectively suppressed induction of COX-2 when added up to 10–14 h after the IL-1β. Since total suppression of transcription is not observed with dexamethasone, these data point to an important functional role for post-transcriptional, possibly including translational and post-translational, mechanisms in the dexamethasone inhibition of COX-2. Again, the dexamethasone effect was blocked by actinomycin D, indicating the requirement for de novo gene synthesis.The role of mRNA stability as a major determinant in the control of gene expression is now well established (29Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). However, the actual mechanisms for these processes are only now being elucidated. One prevailing theme is that shortening and/or loss of the poly(A) tail precedes degradation of the main body of many mRNA species. Consequently, we examined the effect of dexamethasone on COX-2 poly(A) length variation. Consistent with the above hypothesis, we observed a shortening of the average length of COX-2 poly(A) tails following dexamethasone treatment via what appeared to be a processive mechanism. This involves rapid shortening of the poly(A) tail and accumulation of deadenylated intermediates prior to degradation and loss of the main body of the RNA (31Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Many cytokine genes and other acute phase genes are regulated by post-transcriptional mRNA stability as well as transcriptionally (45Yang L. Yang Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32732-32739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Razanajaona D. Maroc C. Lopez M. Mannoni P. Gabert J. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, COX-2 mRNA is stabilized by IL-1, and some evidence indicates a possible role for the 3′-UTR in this effect (20Newton R. Seybold S. Liu S.F. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,24Ristimaki A. Garfinkel S. Wessendorf J. Maciag T. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11769-11775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the human COX-2 3′-UTR contains 22 repeats of the sequence AUUUA, which is common in many cytokine genes and was shown to confer instability to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA (33Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 47Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The addition of the COX-2 3′-UTR to a heterologous reporter failed to confer dexamethasone sensitivity, indicating that the region is not in itself sufficient to confer dexamethasone sensitivity. However, the actual mechanism of degradation appears to involve processive loss of the poly(A) tail. This aspect of mRNA degradation can be conferred by AU elements from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 3′-UTR, and similar elements in the COX-2 3′-UTR may be expected to show a similar function (31Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5777-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Consequently, while the actual mechanism of degradation of COX-2 mRNA may be dictated by sequences in the 3′-UTR, this region is not sufficient to confer dexamethasone responsiveness.Thus, we have established that repression of IL-1β-induced COX-2 by dexamethasone involves some degree (<40%) of transcriptional repression in A549 cells. However, this is not sufficient to account for the observed degree of repression at the product level. In contrast, mouse 3T3 cells showed substantial transcriptional repression of COX-2 by dexamethasone (48DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 49Herschman H.R. Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Ma Q. Varnum B.C. Gilbert R.S. Reddy S.T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 113-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in common with our data, the degree of transcriptional repression was again insufficient to account for the total dexamethasone-dependent inhibition of COX-2 protein, indicative of further repressive mechanisms (48DeWitt D.L. Meade E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 306: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our data point to the existence of significant post-transcriptional mechanisms that require the GR transactivation function for de novo transcription and translation of a gene or genes that mediate dexamethasone-dependent repression. Furthermore, we demonstrate a functional relevance for this mechanism and indicate that loss of COX-2 mRNA as a result of dexamethasone treatment involves prior loss of the COX-2 poly(A) tail. However, the sequences involved in specificity and the events needed to initiate the response remain to be elucidated, and more detailed models are required to address these outstanding issues. Consequently, dexamethasone-dependent repression of COX-2 involves transcriptional as well as additional post-transcriptional or possibly translational mechanisms. It therefore seems that the exact contribution of each repressive mechanism to the overall repressive effect may depend on the cell type and the actual stimulation as well as the time of dexamethasone addition in relation to the stimulus.Recently, the transactivation function of GR, in driving GRE or mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-dependent transcription or expression of the GR-dependent gene tyrosine aminotransferase, was shown to be defective in transgenic mice carrying a point mutation in GR that prevents dimerization (50Reichardt H.M. Kaestner K.H. Tuckermann J. Kretz O. Wessely O. Bock R. Gass P. Schmid W. Herrlich P. Angel P. Schutz G. Cell. 1998; 93: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). In these mice, the repressive effect of dexamethasone on collagenase-3 and gelatinase B gene expression was essentially unaltered, whereas expression of the proopiomelanocortin and prolactin genes, which are thought to be negatively regulated via negative GRE sites, was markedly increased. These observations have been interpreted as showing that GR dimerization is required for GR-dependent transactivation via positive GREs and repression via negative GREs, while the transcriptional interference or transrepression functions of GR are unaffected (51Karin M. Cell. 1998; 93: 487-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). While this is likely to be correct, one further activation function of GR, namely the positive synergistic activation of transcription via interactions with members, for example, of the STAT transcription factor family has been overlooked (52Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J.S. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 53Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1997; 383: 726-728Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Cooperation with STAT proteins does not require GR dimerization and may therefore be unaffected in the GR dimerization-defective mice. We therefore speculate that positive cooperative functions of GR leading to post-transcriptional repressive mechanisms may, in addition to transrepression with factors such as AP-1 and NF-κB, account for GR-dependent repression of inflammatory genes such as COX-2. Prostaglandins (PGs)1form a potent group of autocrine and paracrine lipid mediators (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These compounds are implicated in many normal cellular processes as well as pathophysiological processes such as inflammation, edema, bronchoconstriction, platelet aggregation, fever, and hyperalgesia (1Smith W.L.

Med. 1996; 184: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). PG synthesis involves phospholipase catalyzed release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and its conversion by the two cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes to PGH2. Subsequently, cell-specific isomerases and reductases result in production of biologically relevant PGs. The two COX isoforms are encoded by distinct genes of which COX-1 is a constitutively expressed housekeeping gene and COX-2 shows low basal expression that is rapidly induced by inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar, 2Mitchell J.A. Larkin S. Williams T.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Pharmacologically, this pathway is important, since COX is the target for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and indomethacin (1Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar, 2Mitchell J.A. Larkin S. Williams T.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory benefits of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are thought to derive from inhibition of COX-2, while many of the undesirable side effects are due to COX-1 inhibition (1Smith W.L.

Like the mutations identified within the β-amyloid precursor protein gene, PS mutations cause the increased generation of a highly neurotoxic variant of amyloid β-peptide. PS proteins are proteolytically processed to an N-terminal ∼30-kDa (NTF) and a C-terminal ∼20-kDa fragment (CTF20) that form a heterodimeric complex. We demonstrate that this complex is resistant to proteolytic degradation, whereas the full-length precursor is rapidly degraded. Degradation of the PS1 holoprotein is sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasome. Formation of a heterodimeric complex is required for the stability of both PS1 fragments, since fragments that do not co-immunoprecipitate with the PS complex are rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Mutant PS fragments not incorporated into the heterodimeric complex lose their pathological activity in abnormal amyloid β-peptide generation even after inhibition of their proteolytic degradation. The PS1 heterodimeric complex can be attacked by proteinases of the caspase superfamily that generate an ∼10-kDa proteolytic fragment (CTF10) from CTF20. CTF10 is rapidly degraded most likely by a calpain-like cysteine proteinase. From these data we conclude that PS1 metabolism is highly controlled by multiple proteolytic activities indicating that subtle changes in fragment generation/degradation might be important for Alzheimer’s disease-associated pathology.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1 is the most common dementia worldwide. A pathological hallmark of AD is the invariant accumulation of numerous senile plaques in certain areas of the brain. Senile plaques are composed of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), a proteolytic derivative of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP; see Ref. 1Haass C. Selkoe D.J.

However, in about 10–15% of the cases AD is caused by autosomal dominant mutations within three genes (2Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

In the predominant pathway, proteolytic processing occurs by a putative protease, called the presenilinase (Ref. 23Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T.

PS processing by the presenilinase results in the generation of ∼30-kDa N-terminal and ∼20-kDa C-terminal fragments (NTF and CTF20; see Refs. 23Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H.

The resulting NTF and the CTF20 of PS1 and PS2 bind to each other and form a heterodimeric complex (28Capell A. Grünberg J. Pesold B. Diehlmann A. Citron M. Nixon R. Beyreuther K. Selkoe D.J.

In contrast to the wt PS1 holoprotein, which does not participate in complex formation, PS1Δexon9 substitutes the PS1 complex as a holoprotein (28Capell A. Grünberg J. Pesold B. Diehlmann A.

In addition to processing by the presenilinase, both PS proteins are substrates for proteinases of the caspase superfamily (31Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E.

Deuschle U. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2263-2270Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) which generates a smaller ∼10-kDa C-terminal fragment (Fig. 1 A). Caspase-mediated cleavage appears to be enhanced by a FAD mutation occurring within the PS2 gene (31Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Formation of CTF20 is highly regulated. Overexpression of PS results in the replacement of endogenous PS fragments but not in a linear accumulation of the overexpressed fragments (23Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H.

Moreover, slight changes in the tightly balanced fragment formation might be pathologically relevant (see Refs. 24Mercken M. Takahashi H. Honda T. Sato K. Murayama M. Nakazato Y. Noguchi K.

Alzheimer’s Res. 1997; 3: 253-259Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the stability of the PS precursor and its proteolytic fragments in transfected and untransfected cells and found that PS1 expression is highly controlled by multiple proteolytic degradation pathways. The formation of a heterodimeric complex protects the fragments from their rapid degradation, and complex formation appears to be required for the pathological activity of PS on Aβ42 generation. Our data suggest that proteolytic degradation plays a major role in a balanced and equal expression of PS fragments. These data further indicate that slight changes in the stability of excess amounts of PS fragments might be pathologically relevant.

Anandamide (arachidonylethanolamide; AnNH)1 is an endogenous lipid that binds to cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are mainly found in the central nervous system and in peripheral immune cells. It mimics the pharmacological effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the active principle of hashish and marijuana (1Devane W.A. Hannus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin G. Gibson D.

Nature. 1996; 382: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). AnNH formation occurs mainly through phosphodiesterase-mediated cleavage of N-arachidonoylphosphatidylethanolamine (3Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S. Cimino G. Schwartz J.-C. Piomelli D. Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar, 4Sasaki T. Chang C.J.

Nature. 1994; 372: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Upon binding to CB1 receptors, AnNH induces inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation, inhibition of N-type Ca2+ channels, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway (reviewed in Ref. 7Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation (8Derkinderen P. Toutant M. Burgaya F. Le Bert M. Siciliano J.C. de Franciscis V. Gelman M. Girault J.-A. Science. 1996; 273: 1719-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Activation of the CB2 receptor leads to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling (9Wartmann M. Campbell D. Subramanian A. Burstein S.H. Davis R.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AnNH binding to cannabinoid receptors is coupled to nitric oxide (NO) release in the central nervous system of invertebrates and in peripheral immune cells of both invertebrates and humans (10Stefano G.B. Liu Y. Goligorsky M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19238-19242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The pharmacological effects of AnNH on CB1 and CB2 receptors depend on the life span of the lipid in the extracellular space, which is limited by a rapid and selective process of cellular uptake, followed by intracellular degradation of AnNH to ethanolamine and arachidonic acid by the enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Both components of the inactivation process of AnNH are the subject of active investigation. AnNH uptake has been characterized in rat neuronal cells (3Di Marzo V. Fontana A. Cadas H. Schinelli S.

Furthermore, FAAH activity has been shown in one “neuronal” cell line, namely mouse neuroblastoma N18TG2 (17Maurelli S. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Lucia A. Marino G. Di Marzo V.

The FAAH gene has recently been cloned from rat, mouse, and human liver cDNAs, allowing molecular mass determination and substrate specificity analysis of the enzyme (18Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K.

This prompted us to investigate some biochemical properties of FAAH from human brain and human neuronal and immune cells, i.e. neuroblastoma CHP100 and lymphoma U937 cells. AnNH uptake was characterized in these two cell types to gain information on the AnNH inactivation process in humans. The cell lines chosen are widely used as experimental models for neuronal (20Corasaniti M.T. Melino G. Navarra M. Garaci E. Finazzi Agrò A. Nisticò G. Neurodegeneration. 1995; 4: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and immune (21Galiègue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D. Carriere D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G.

Taken together, the results reported here represent the first biochemical characterization of human brain FAAH. Most properties of this enzyme are shared by FAAH found in human neuronal and immune cells in culture. Remarkably, both cell lines seem to inactivate AnNH in the same way, which strengthens the concept of a neuroimmune axis in humans, which is evident, for instance, in the “axon-reflex” model for neurogenic inflammation (13Bisogno T.

In four cases, the perilesional white matter surrounding the tumor area was removed (1 g of fresh tissue in total) and used for FAAH characterization. In one case, both meningioma and perilesional white matter (0.1 g of each fresh tissue) were removed and used to compare FAAH activity and expression in meningioma and healthy brain.

Both CHP100 and U937 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere.

Both CHP100 and U937 cells (3 × 108/sample) were collected in phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min. The dry pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold buffer A and sonicated on ice three times for 10 s, with 10-s intervals, using a Vibracell sonifier (Sonics & Materials Inc.) with a microtip at maximum power. The homogenate was then centrifuged sequentially as described above for the human brain, and the final pellet was stored at −80 °C in buffer A at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml until use. The assay of FAAH (arachidonylethanolamide amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.4) activity was performed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as recently described (22Van der Stelt M. Paoletti A.M. Maccarrone M. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Bagetta G. Veldink G.A. Finazzi Agrò A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thermal stability and pH dependence of FAAH activity were studied as described (17Maurelli S. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Di Lucia A. Marino G. Di Marzo V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Activation energy values were calculated as reported (25Segel I.H. Biochemical Calculations. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1976: 277-281Google Scholar). Kinetic and inhibition studies were performed using different concentrations of [1-14C]AnNH (in the 0–21 μm range) and two different concentrations (10 and 20 μm) of each inhibitor to calculate the kinetic parameters. Fitting of the experimental points to a Lineweaver-Burk plot by a linear regression program (Kaleidagraph Version 3.0) yielded straight lines with r values >0.95. The assay of the FAAH synthase activity was performed by measuring the formation of [1-14C]AnNH from [1-14C]arachidonic acid and ethanolamine as reported (5Ueda N. Kurahashi Y. Yamamoto S. Tokunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23823-23827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Tissue or cell homogenates (20 μg of proteins/test) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 10 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid (52 mCi/mmol) and 2 mm ethanolamine. The reaction was stopped, and the products were extracted and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC following the same procedure as described above for the hydrolase activity. FAAH synthase activity is expressed as picomoles of AnNH formed per min/mg of protein. The effect of various compounds on the hydrolase or synthase activity of FAAH was determined by adding each substance directly to the assay buffer at the indicated concentrations. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) was performed under reducing conditions in a Mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad) with 0.75-mm spacer arms (26Maccarrone M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21014-21017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rainbow molecular mass markers (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) were phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.0 kDa), and ovalbumin (46.0 kDa). Native isoelectric focusing was performed in the Mini-Protean II apparatus using a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing ampholytes in the pH range 5.0–9.0 (Sigma) as described (27Robertson E.F. Dannelly H.K. Malloy P.J. Reeves H.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was calibrated by running the following pI markers (Sigma): lentil (Lens culinaris) lectin (pI 8.8, 8.6, and 8.2), myoglobin from horse heart (pI 7.2 and 6.8), carbonic anhydrase I from human erythrocytes (pI 6.6), and carbonic anhydrase II from bovine erythrocytes (pI 5.9). Human brain homogenates (20 μg/lane), prepared as described above for FAAH assay, were subjected to either SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or isoelectric focusing, and then slab gels were electroblotted onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad) using a Mini-TransBlot apparatus (Bio-Rad) as reported (26Maccarrone M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21014-21017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodetection of FAAH on nitrocellulose filters was performed with specific anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:200), raised in rabbits against the conserved FAAH sequence VGYYETDNYTMPSPAMR (19Giang D.K. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2238-2242Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), conjugated to ovalbumin. This peptide antigen and the anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies were prepared by Primm s. r. l. (Milan, Italy). Goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad; diluted 1:2000) was used as secondary antibody, and immunoreactive bands were stained with the alkaline phosphatase staining solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed by coating the plate with human brain homogenate (20 μg/well), prepared as described above for the FAAH assay. Anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies were used as primary antibody (diluted 1:300), and goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate as secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000). Color development of the alkaline phosphatase reaction was measured at 405 nm using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. For peptide competition experiments, the peptide antigen was preincubated with a 1000-fold molar excess of anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies for 30 min at room temperature before adding the antibodies to the wells (18Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar). Controls were carried out using non-immune rabbit serum and included wells coated with different amounts of bovine serum albumin. 2–5 × 106 cells or 20 mg of tissue were used to isolate total RNA by means of the S.N.A.P.TMtotal RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen). Control reactions were carried out to ensure complete removal of genomic DNA. RT-PCRs were performed using the EZ rTth RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction conditions were carefully examined to stop the reaction during the exponential phase of amplification of each gene. Briefly, 100 ng (for the amplification of FAAH) or 0.4 ng (for 18 S rRNA) of total RNA were reversibly transcribed and amplified in the same tube in a total reaction volume of 10 μl in the presence of 3 mCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham International). The amplification parameters were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C, 45 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C. Linear amplification was observed after 20 cycles. The primers were as follows: (+)5′-TGGAAGTCCTCCAAAAGCCCAG and (−)5′-TGTCCATAGACACAGCCCTTCAG for FAAH and (+)5′-AGTTGCTGCAGTTAAAAAGC and (−)5′-CCTCAGTTCCGAAAACCAAC for 18 S rRNA. Five μl of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, which was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Products were validated by size determination and sequencing. For quantitation of the RT-PCR products, bands were excised from the gel and counted in an LKB1214 Rackbeta scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Linear amplification sequencing was performed using a CyclistTM DNA sequencing kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR products for sequencing were prepared without [α-32P]dCTP and sequenced with the same primers used for amplification after labeling them with [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham International). The uptake of [1-14C]AnNH (52 mCi/mmol) in intact CHP100 or U937 cells was studied essentially as described (13Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). CHP100 and U937 cells were resuspended in their serum-free culture media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (2 ml/test) were incubated for different time intervals at 37 °C with 100 nm[1-14C]AnNH; then they were washed three times in 2 ml of culture medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and were finally resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Membrane lipids were then extracted (28Maccarrone M. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Dullens H.F.J. Catani M.V. Melino G. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi Agrò A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol, and mixed with 3.5 ml of Sigma-Fluor liquid scintillation mixture for non-aqueous samples (Sigma), and radioactivity was measured in an LKB1214 Rackbeta scintillation counter. To discern non-protein-mediated from protein-mediated transport of AnNH into cell membranes, control experiments were carried out at 4 °C (13Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3315-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Incubations (15 min) were also carried out with different concentrations of [1-14C]AnNH (in the 0–750 nmrange) to determine apparent K m and V max of the uptake by Lineweaver-Burk analysis (in this case, the uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C). The Q 10 value was calculated as the ratio of AnNH uptake at 30 and 20 °C (11Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). AnNH uptake is expressed as picomoles of AnNH taken up per min/mg of protein. The effect of different compounds on AnNH uptake was determined by adding each substance directly to the incubation medium at the indicated concentrations. In the case of CCCP, cells were preincubated with 50 μm CCCP for 15 min at 37 °C before the addition of [1-14C]AnNH to abolish mitochondrial transmembrane potential (29Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Cell viability after each treatment was checked with trypan blue and found to be higher than 90% in all cases. It is noteworthy that no specific binding of [3H]CP55940, a potent cannabinoid, was obtained with plasma membranes of CHP100 cells, 2M. Maccarrone, A. M. Paoletti, G. Bagetta, and A. Finazzi Agrò, unpublished results. and U937 cells express hardly detectable levels of CB1 mRNA and very low levels of CB2 mRNA (21Galiègue S. Mary S. Marchand J. Dussossoy D. Carriere D. Carayon P. Bouaboula M. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar); thus, [1-14C]AnNH binding to CB receptors is not likely to interfere in the uptake experiments (11Hillard C.J. Edgemond W.S. Jarrahian A. Campbell W.B. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,13Bisogno T. Maurelli S. Melck D. De Petrocellis L. Di Marzo V. J. Biol.

Data reported in this paper are the means ± S.D. of at least three independent determinations, each performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student’s t test, elaborating experimental data by means of the InStat program (GraphPAD Software for Science). Pilot experiments indicated that human brain FAAH activity was linearly dependent on the amount of tissue homogenate (in the range 0–30 μg of protein) and the incubation time of the reaction (in the range 0–30 min), whereas it depended on AnNH concentration according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1 A) (data not shown), yielding an apparent K m of 2.0 ± 0.2 μmand a V max of 800 ± 75 pmol·min−1·mg of protein−1. The activity of FAAH was assayed in the pH range 5.0–11.0 and in the temperature range 20–65 °C, showing an optimum pH and temperature at 9.0 and 37 °C, respectively. Arrhenius diagrams of AnNH hydrolysis by FAAH in the temperature range 20–45 °C allowed us to calculate an activation energy of 43.5 ± 4.5 kJ·mol−1. Hydroxylated AnNH derivatives and the linoleoyl analogues of AnNH were competitive inhibitors of human brain FAAH, with apparentK i values ranging from 3.2 to 24.5 μm(Table I). These AnNH congeners were also alternate substrates of FAAH, yielding total activities that ranged from 85% (11-HAnNH) to 49% (13-HODNH2) of the activity obtained with AnNH itself (Table I). The substrate specificity of FAAH from human brain resembled that of the enzyme from mouse or rat brain (18Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B.

Western blotting showed that anti-FAAH polyclonal antibodies specifically recognized a single immunoreactive band in brain homogenates, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼67 kDa and an isoelectric point of ∼7.6 (Fig. 2). Human neuronal (CHP100) and immune (U937) cells in culture also showed FAAH activity, with pH and temperature profiles superimposable to those observed with the human brain enzyme (data not shown).

In the translocation model, based on study of bacterial MutS, ATP binding reduces affinity of the protein for a mismatch and activates secondary DNA binding sites that are subsequently used for movement of the protein along the helix contour in a reaction dependent on nucleotide hydrolysis (Allen, D. J., Makhov, A., Grilley, M., Taylor, J., Thresher, R., Modrich, P., and Griffith, J. D. (1997)EMBO J. 16, 4467–4476). The molecular switch model, based on study of human MutSα, invokes mismatch recognition by the MutSα·ADP complex. After recruitment of downstream repair activities to the MutSα·mismatch complex, ATP binding results in release of MutSα from the heteroduplex (Gradia, S., Acharya, S., and Fishel, R.(1997) Cell 91, 995–1005). To further clarify the function of ATP binding and hydrolysis in human MutSα action, we evaluated the effects of ATP, ADP, and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs on the lifetime of protein·DNA complexes. All of these nucleotides were found to increase the rate of dissociation of MutSα from oligonucleotide heteroduplexes. These experiments also showed that ADP is not required for mismatch recognition by MutSα, but that the nucleotide alters the dynamics of formation and dissociation of specific complexes. Analysis of the mechanism of ATP-promoted dissociation of MutSα from a 200-base pair heteroduplex demonstrated that dissociation occurs at DNA ends in a reaction dependent on ATP hydrolysis, implying that release from this molecule involves movement of the protein along the helix contour as predicted for a translocation mechanism. In order to reconcile the relatively large rate of movement of MutS homologs along the helix with their modest rate of ATP hydrolysis, we propose a novel mechanism for protein translocation along DNA that supports directional movement over long distances with minimal energy input.

In addition to their mismatch recognition activities, bacterial and eukaryotic MutS activities have an associated ATPase activity that is required for function of the proteins in mismatch repair (1Haber L.T.

Two distinct functions have been proposed for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by MutS homologs, both of which are based on the effects of ATP on MutS-heteroduplex interaction. The presence of ATP greatly reduces the efficiency of specific complex formation between bacterial MutS or eukaryotic MutSα and heteroduplex DNA (5Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J.

Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and ATP challenge of preformed MutS·heteroduplex complexes has been shown to result in departure of the protein from the mismatch (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Available information indicates that some of these effects are attributable to ATP binding. Thus, ATPγS has been shown to promote departure of MutS from the mismatch in heteroduplex DNA (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), while ATPγS or ATP (in the absence of a divalent cation) reduce the binding efficiency human MutSα (hMutSα) to synthetic heteroduplexes (5Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of complexes between bacterial MutS and large heteroduplexes prepared from natural DNAs has demonstrated that ATP-promoted release of MutS from a mismatch is associated with efficient conversion of protein·DNA complexes to α-shaped loop structures stabilized by MutS at the base (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Loop formation requires a mismatch, loop size increases linearly with time, loop growth depends on continued ATP hydrolysis, and the mismatch usually ends up in the loop. These observations have been interpreted in terms of a mechanism in which ATP binding reduces affinity of the protein for a mispair and activates secondary DNA binding sites that are subsequently used for movement of the protein along the helix contour in a reaction dependent on nucleotide hydrolysis (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). MutS movement in this manner has been postulated to be important for the coupling of mismatch recognition to loading of the excision system at the strand break that directs repair (12Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), a site that can be located hundreds of base pairs from this mismatch. The finding that ATP binding reduces the efficiency of specific complex formation between hMutSα and oligonucleotide heteroduplexes has led to proposal of a molecular switch model for action of MutS activities. Like a G-protein, hMutSα is postulated to exist in two states, an ADP-bound form that binds with near irreversible affinity to a mismatch and an ATP-bound form that does not (10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this proposal hMutSα·ADP binds to a mispair and recruits downstream activities to this site. After assembly of the excision system, ATP binding results in dissociation of hMutSα from the heteroduplex so that repair may proceed (10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To further clarify the role(s) of ATP binding and hydrolysis in hMutSα action, we have evaluated the effects of ATP, ADP, and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs on the lifetime of hMutSα·DNA complexes and have examined the effect of DNA topology on ATP-promoted dissociation of hMutSα complexes with small heteroduplexes. We demonstrate that ADP is not required for mismatch recognition by hMutSα, but that the nucleotide alters the dynamics of formation and dissociation of specific hMutSα·mismatch complexes. We also show that ATP-promoted dissociation of hMutSα from small heteroduplexes is blocked by physical barriers placed at the ends of the DNA. This implies that ATP-promoted dissociation of hMutSα from small heteroduplexes involves movement along the helix contour, as predicted for a translocation mechanism. Human MutSα was purified as described previously to a purity in excess of 95% (7Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). ADP and ATP levels in purified hMutSα were determined using an ATP bioluminescent assay kit (Sigma). For ATP determination, 50 μl of hMutSα (108 nm in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) was heat-denatured at 90 °C for 5 min, followed by addition of 50 μl of 120 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 20 mmMgCl2, 2 mm KCl, 3 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The diluted solution was mixed with 100 μl of a 25-fold dilution of the luminescent assay mix (Sigma), placed in a scintillation vial, and photon emission determined in the tritium channel of a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. ATP standards prepared in a similar manner yielded a linear response throughout the range tested (0.4–12.5 nm). ADP was determined by the same procedure after conversion to ATP by pyruvate kinase (14Senior A.E. Lee R.S. al-Shawi M.K. Weber J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 297: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Hampp R. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. 7. VCH Publishers, Inc, Deerfield Beach, FL1984: 370-379Google Scholar). Preparations of hMutSα were depleted of nucleotide using Sephadex G50 spin column chromatography. Protein samples were either kept on ice or spun through a 1-ml G50 Sephadex column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl. Samples (50 μl) of 215 nm hMutSα, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were loaded onto spin columns, which were centrifuged briefly in a clinical centrifuge. Presence of nucleotide in gel-filtered samples was determined as described above. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) and, when indicated, were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) to a specific activity of 1 × 106 to 3 × 106 cpm/pmol. Duplexes were prepared by mixing molar equivalents of an unlabeled or 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide with an appropriate unlabeled complementary sequence in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and heating to 99 °C in a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp 9600 thermocycler, followed by cooling to 25 °C over a 30-min period. The solution of annealed duplex (50 μl) was adjusted to 1 m in NaCl and mixed with 5–10 μl of benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose suspension (50% settled volume) in batch to remove single-stranded DNA (16Gamper H. Lehman N. Piette J. Hearst J.E. DNA. 1985; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide/ benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose mixture was layered on top of a Sephadex G50 spin column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and oligonucleotide duplexes recovered after centrifugation. DNA concentration was determined by A 260 or estimated from specific radioactivity. PCR1-generated substrates were constructed by hybridizing appropriate single strands isolated from duplex DNA fragments produced by amplification of base pairs 5531–5732 of bacteriophages f1MR1 and f1MR3. The DNA sequences of the two phages are identical except for an A·T to G·C substitution at position 5632 (17Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6829-6835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Forward (5′-TACGCGCAGCGTGACCGCTA) and reverse (5′-AAGTTTTTTGGGGTCGAGGT) primers were synthesized with or without a 5′-biotin tag as indicated. A smaller fragment amplified from region 5535–5732 was also prepared using the forward primer 5′-CGCAGCGTGACCGCTACACT and the reverse primer above. PCR reactions (1 ml) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mmKCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 ng of f1MR1 or f1MR3 DNA, 1 μm of each primer, 0.2 mmdCTP, dGTP, dATP, and dTTP, and 40 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The 1-ml reaction was divided into 10 100-μl aliquots and amplified for 25 cycles using a Perkin-Elmer Gene Amp 9600 thermocycler. Incubations were at 94 °C for 15 s, 66 °C for 15 s, and 70 °C for 10 s, except that incubation time for the first stage of the first cycle was 2 min and the third stage of the 25th cycle was 2 min. The 10 aliquots were pooled and DNA product purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The combined reactions yielded approximately 5 μg of amplified product. Single strands were isolated from PCR products by high performance liquid chromatography using a Gen-Pak Fax column (4.6 × 100 mm, Waters) under denaturing conditions. Each PCR product (∼5 μg in 100 μl) was diluted to 400 μl with buffer A (250 mmTris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA adjusted to pH 12.4 with NaOH) containing 0.5 m NaCl and injected onto the column equilibrated with this buffer at a flow rate of 0.55 ml/min. After washing for 5 min with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl, DNA was eluted with a gradient of NaCl (0.5–0.85 m NaCl) in buffer A over a 35-min period. The two complementary strands eluted in two distinct peaks, with elution of the first beginning at 0.65m NaCl. Under these conditions, the viral strand sequence eluted first followed by the complementary strand sequence, each recovered in a volume of about 0.5 ml. Eluted single strands were supplemented with 50 μl of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and DNA precipitated with ethanol. Final yield was about 2 μg of each strand. 5′-Biotinylated viral strand sequence (coordinates 5531–5732) derived from of f1MR1 was combined with 5′-biotinylated complementary strand sequence (coordinates 5535–5732) prepared from f1MR1 or f1MR3 to form a homoduplex (f1MR1/f1MR1) or a G-T heteroduplex (f1MR1/MR3), respectively. Strands were annealed and the resulting duplex purified from excess single strands as described above. Resulting 201-residue fragments were biotinylated at opposing 5′-ends and contained a recessed 3′-terminus (positions 5531–5534). DNAs were end-labeled at the recessed terminus in reactions (100 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 33 nm (molecules) of oligonucleotide duplex, 5 units of exo-free Klenow DNA polymerase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 25 μm dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products, 3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with radiolabeled dCTP, followed by another 10-min incubation after addition of the unlabeled triphosphates. Reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA to 24 mm, and free nucleotides were removed by G50 spin column chromatography. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. A 32P-labeled control 201-bp DNA that was biotin-tagged at only one end was prepared by a similar procedure, except that only one PCR primer was 5′-biotin-tagged. Binding of bacterial MutS to f1MR heteroduplex DNA containing a mismatch at position 5632 blocks cleavage byNheI endonuclease, which recognizes base pairs 5621–5626 (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We have used this assay to score hMutSα binding to a 50-bp synthetic oligonucleotide G-T heteroduplex corresponding in sequence to positions 5611–5660 of the f1MR1/f1MR3 G-T heteroduplex. Reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm KCl, and [32P]G-T heteroduplex and hMutSα as indicated. After 15 min at 37 °C, 2 units of NheI (New England Biolabs) in 2.5 μl of reaction buffer were added and incubation continued for an additional 30 s. Reactions were terminated by addition of 15 μl of 40% (w/w) urea in formamide containing 0.05% xylene cyanol and 0.05% bromphenol blue. DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, 7 murea at 40 mA. DNA species were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Nucleotide-promoted dissociation of hMutSα from the G-T heteroduplex was scored in a similar fashion except that preincubation with hMutSα was for 10 min, and indicated nucleotides were added together withNheI endonuclease, with subsequent incubation for 5 min. Binding reactions (20 μl) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, with hMutSα, 32P-labeled substrate, and unlabeled competitor DNAs present as indicated. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, reactions were stopped by adding 2.2 μl of 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% xylene cyanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, placed on ice, and loaded immediately onto a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide-bisacrylamide 37.5:1). Gels were electrophoresed at 11.4 V/cm in 6.7 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 32P-labeled protein-DNA complexes visualized by autoradiography after drying. Surface plasmon resonance measurements used a BIAcore 2000. Streptavidin SA sensor chips (Pharmacia Biosensor) were preconditioned according to the manufacturer’s protocol and then derivatized with about 100 response units of a biotinylated 31-bp G-T heteroduplex that has been described previously (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Human MutSα was bound to the derivatized chip by injecting a 50 nm solution of the heterodimer at a flow rate of 15 μl/min in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) containing 9 mm MgCl2. Immediately after the association phase was complete, the chip was washed at 15 μl/min with the HBS-MgCl2 buffer, or with this buffer containing ATP, ADP, or AMPPNP as indicated. Measurements were performed at 25 °C, and samples were maintained at 4 °C prior to injection. The heteroduplex-modified SA chip was regenerated by a 20-μl injection of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The translocation and molecular switch models postulate different roles for ATP binding and hydrolysis in the function of MutS homologs. In the translocation model, ATP binding and hydrolysis cycles the mismatch recognition activity between several conformational states that are involved in departure of the protein from the mismatch and movement along the helix contour (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). By contrast, the molecular switch model invokes the MutS·ADP complex as the mismatch binding species, with ATP binding subsequent to repair complex assembly promoting release of the protein from the heteroduplex so that excision repair may occur (10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). One potential problem with the molecular switch model is that bacterial, mammalian, and yeast MutS activities bind with high specificity to mismatched base pairs in the absence of exogenous nucleotide (7Drummond J.T.

Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,20Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9837-9841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that these MutS activities may purify as the ADP complex. To address this possibility, we have tested near homogeneous hMutSα isolated from HeLa cells for presence of adenine nucleotides. Analysis of several independent hMutSα preparations using a bioluminescent assay (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated presence of 0.003 mol of ATP and 0.2 mol of ADP per mol of the MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer. The presence of nucleotide in hMutSα preparations was expected since the protein is purified by a two-step procedure, the first of which involves elution from DNA cellulose by ATP and Mg2+ (7Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In fact, ATP and ADP present in hMutSα preparations were reduced by more than 90% by gel filtration spin column chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, nucleotide depletion had no effect on the ability of hMutSα to bind specifically to G-T heteroduplex DNA, as judged by restriction endonuclease protection assay. Therefore, ADP is not required for hMutSα·mismatch binding. In contrast to ATP, which reduces the affinity of hMutSα for a mismatch (7Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 8Iaccarino I. Palombo F. Drummond J. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Modrich P. Jiricny J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 484-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), ADP does not alter the specific equilibrium affinity of the protein for heteroduplex DNA to a significant degree (10Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, ADP does alter the dynamics of hMutSα· heteroduplex interaction as judged by several criteria. Fig. 2 (upper panel) shows the dissociation kinetics of specific hMutSα complexes with a 31-bp G-T heteroduplex as visualized by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Dissociation kinetics monitored by this method were biphasic, and results were fit to a sum of two exponentials. Dissociation rate constants corresponding to the major amplitude, which represented 72–97% of the protein·DNA complexes, are summarized in Table I. In the presence of Mg2+ but in the absence of nucleotide, the major species dissociated with a half-life of about 5 min. Inclusion of 1 mm ATP increased the off-rate about 200-fold. This ATP effect is independent of hydrolysis since 1 mm AMPPNP or 1 mm ATP in the absence of Mg+2 enhanced the dissociation rate to a similar degree, results consistent with previous findings suggesting that ATP binding is sufficient for mismatch dissociation in the case of bacterial MutS (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and hMutSα (5Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J.

The presence of ADP also resulted in a large increase in the rate of dissociation of hMutSα·heteroduplex complexes: 1 mm ADP decreased the half-life of specific complexes 25-fold relative to that observed with buffer alone (Table I).Table IKinetics of MutSα·heteroduplex dissociation promoted by nucleotide cofactorsNucleotide (1 mm)Amplitudek obst 1/2fractions−1sBuffer only0.930.002 ± 0.00001350 ± 2ATP0.970.42 ± 0.011.7 ± 0.04ATP (−Mg2+)0.880.45 ± 0.011.5 ± 0.03AMPPNP0.720.33 ± 0.012.1 ± 0.06ADP0.860.05 ± 0.00114 ± 0.3k obs and amplitude values were obtained by nonlinear least squares fit (27Marquardt D.W.

The rate constants shown are for dissociation of the major species, which represented 72–97% of the material (Amplitude). Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that the increased rate of hMutSα·heteroduplex dissociation is a saturable function of ATP concentration. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of complex dissociation increases hyperbolically with ATP concentration, with aK m of 37 μm, a value very similar to the K m for the nucleotide in the DNA-stimulated ATPase reaction (10Gradia S.

NheI restriction endonuclease protection assay confirmed saturability of ATP-promoted dissociation and also indicated saturability for dissociation promoted by AMPPNP and ADP (Fig. 3). In this assay, preformed hMutSα·heteroduplex complexes were challenged with NheI and nucleotide, and incubation continued for 5 min (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although individual K 1/2 values obtained by this method cannot be interpreted analytically due to the fact that dissociation occurs during the NheI assay period, comparison of K 1/2 values provides an estimate of the relative efficacy of the different nucleotides for promoting dissociation of the hMutSα· heteroduplex complex. The relativeK 1/2 values for ADP and AMPPNP determined in this way are about 5 and 100 times greater than that for ATP, respectively (Fig. 3). The low relative affinity of the hMutSα·heteroduplex complex for AMPPNP is in accord with previous findings, indicating that this nucleotide is less effective than ATP in suppressing the formation of specific complexes with oligonucleotide heteroduplexes (5Iaccarino I.

To further clarify the roles of ATP and ADP in the dynamics of hMutSα-DNA interaction, kinetic competition studies were performed. In these experiments, preformed complexes of hMutSα and a 50-bp [32P]G-T heteroduplex were challenged with a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled 50-bp heteroduplex or homoduplex DNA in the presence of ADP or ATP (Fig. 4). In the absence of nucleotide, only a modest reduction in preformed hMutSα·DNA complexes was observed (compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 1), consistent with the kinetic"

M., Law, R., Rong, J., and McDonald, J. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1395–1401). Here, we examine whether cholesterol-enriched compartments in the plasma membrane are responsible for such differential regulation. Pretreatment of BAEC with a cholesterol-binding antibiotic, filipin, did not inhibit shear-dependent activation of JNK. In contrast, filipin and other membrane-permeable cholesterol-binding agents (digitonin and nystatin), but not the lipid-binding agent xylazine, inhibited shear-dependent activation of ERK. The effect of cholesterol-binding drugs did not appear to be due to membrane permeabilization, since treatment of BAEC with a detergent, Triton X-100 which also permeabilizes membranes, did not inhibit shear-dependent activation of ERK. Furthermore, shear-dependent activation of ERK, but not JNK, was inhibited by cyclodextrin, a membrane-impermeable cholesterol-binding agent, which removes cell-surface cholesterol. Moreover, the effects of cyclodextrin were prevented by adding cholesterol during the incubation. These results indicate that cholesterol or cholesterol-sensitive compartments in the plasma membrane play a selective and essential role in activation of ERK, but not JNK, by shear stress. Although exposure to shear stress (1 h) increased the number of caveolae by 3-fold, treatment with filipin had no effect in either control or shear-exposed cells suggesting that caveolae densityper se is not a crucial determinant in shear-dependent ERK activation. In summary, the current study suggests that cholesterol-sensitive microdomains in the plasma membrane, such as caveolae-like domains, play a critical role in differential activation of ERK and JNK by shear stress.

Furthermore, a conserved cis-acting shear stress response element has been identified in many shear-sensitive genes including platelet-derived growth factor-B, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, tissue plasminogen activator, and transforming growth factor β-1, suggesting its broad implication in shear-dependent regulation of gene expressions (6Resnick N.

Shear stress also transiently activates nuclear factor-κB, immediate early response genes, and transcription factors that are likely to be involved in the regulation of shear-dependent gene expression (8Khachigian L.M.

Members of the MAP kinase family, ERK, JNK (also known as stress-activated protein kinase), and p38 kinase, have been proposed as important signaling components linking extracellular stimuli to cellular responses including cellular growth, death, differentiation, and metabolic regulation (17Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Recently, shear stress has been shown to differentially regulate activation of ERK and JNK, and at least some of shear-stimulated gene expressions are regulated by MAP kinases (15Jo H. Sipos K.

Chien S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5947-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Shear stress activates ERK in a rapid and transient manner (maximum by 5 min which returns to basal by 30 min shear exposure), whereas JNK activation occurs over a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min and returning to basal levels after 1 day shear exposure) than that of ERK (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, ERK activation is shear force-dependent (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively) whereas that of JNK activity is either “turned off” under no shear condition or “turned on” maximally by even a relatively low shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2) (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that Gαi2/tyrosine kinase(s)/Ras and Gβ/γ/tyrosine kinase(s)/Ras are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of ERK and JNK, respectively (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). How do endothelial cells control activation of specific signaling pathways leading to differential activation of ERK and JNK in response to various shear regimens? We hypothesized that there may be a spatial and/or temporal compartmentalization of signaling complexes in microdomains, which enable an orderly and efficient regulation of signaling cascades in response to shear stress. Cholesterol-enriched compartments such as caveolae and “sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts” (also called as “caveolae-like domains” or “pre-caveolae”) are candidate micro-signaling domains (19Rothberg K.G.

Caveolae are non-coated, flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane (50–100 nm in diameter) and are found in most cell types including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and adipocytes (19Rothberg K.G.

Caveolae are found in both the apical and basal plasma membranes and carry out at least two different functions as follows: 1) transport large and small molecules (transcytosis of macromolecules and potocytosis of ions and the vitamin folate), and 2) act as transmembrane signaling microdomains (20Okamoto T.

Caveolae appear to be formed by self-packaging of “caveolin” along with highly concentrated cholesterol and glycolipids (25Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The present study was designed to examine whether cholesterol-sensitive membrane microdomains are involved in the signaling pathways responsible for the differential activation of ERK and JNK in response to shear stress. This study shows evidence that cholesterol or cholesterol-sensitive microdomains in the plasma membrane play a critical role in shear-dependent activation of ERK but not in the JNK pathway. BAEC harvested from descending thoracic aortas were maintained (37 °C, 5% CO2) in a growth medium (DMEM (1 g/liter glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% fetal calf serum (FCS, Atlanta Biologicals) without antibiotics) (34Jo H. Dull R.O. Hollis T.M. Tarbell J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1992-H1996PubMed Google Scholar). Cells used in this study were between passages 5 and 10. For shear experiments, 1 million cells per glass slide (75 × 38 mm, Fisher) were seeded in growth medium. The next day, the medium was changed to a starvation medium (phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.5% FCS and 25 mm HEPES) and incubated for 18 h. Stock solutions (1 mg/ml each freshly prepared in 95% ethanol) of filipin, digitonin, nystatin, xylazine (Sigma) and up to 0.5% of ethanol as a vehicle control were added to the starvation medium 10 min before subjecting cells to shear stress. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (prepared in distilled H2O, Sigma) was added to the starvation medium containing lipoprotein-free FCS (35Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar) and incubated with cells for 60 min. In some studies, 1.3 mm cholesterol (Avanti) was added during the 1-h cyclodextrin treatment to block chelation of cholesterol from cell membrane (36Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To test whether the effect of filipin on shear-dependent activation of ERK is reversible, cells were first preincubated with filipin (1 μg/ml) for 10 min, washed in starvation medium, and then incubated in the fresh medium without filipin for up to another hour before subjecting cells to shear stress. BAEC were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml calcein AM (Molecular Probe) for 30 min at 37° in DMEM, 0.5% FCS. The calcein-loaded cells were washed three times with HEPES-buffered saline (MediaTech) followed by incubation with 0–0.1% Triton X-100 in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, the medium was collected, and cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The amount of calcein that leaked out from the cells was determined in a Perkin-Elmer fluorimeter (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm) as described (37Bischof J.C. Padanilam J. Holmes W.H. Ezzell R.M. Lee R.C. Tompkins R.C. Yarmush M.L. Toner M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2608-2614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell extracts were assayed by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The glass slide containing a BAEC monolayer was assembled into a parallel plate shear chamber forming a flow channel (220 μm height × 25 mm width × 62 mm length) between the monolayer and fabricated polycarbonate plate as described (38Kuchan M.J. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-pulsatile, laminar shear stress was controlled by changing the flow rate of the starvation medium containing drugs (e.g. filipin or vehicle) delivered to the cells using the constant head flow-loop or a syringe pump (KD Scientific) as described (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 38Kuchan M.J. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following shear exposure, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS, scraped in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), solubilized for 15 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 15 min to prepare Triton-soluble lysate as described (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Entire fractionation or solubilization procedures were performed at 4 °C. The protein content of solubilized cell lysates was measured by using a Bio-Rad DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). Soluble lysates (10 μg each) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and probed with antibodies specific to ERK1/2 or phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) (New England Biolabs) as described (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as a secondary antibody, and the membrane was developed by a chemiluminescent detection method (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activity of JNK1 was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using an antibody specific for JNK1 (PharMingen, clone number G151-333) and c-Jun (amino acids 5–89) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-c-Jun) as the substrate as described (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Briefly, Triton-soluble cell lysates (100 μg each) were incubated with JNK1 antibody (0.25 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with protein G-agarose. The immune complex was washed four times in the lysis buffer and twice in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mmvanadate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The washed immunocomplexes were incubated in 20 μl of buffer A containing GST-c-Jun (5 μg each), 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by boiling in 5× Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Autoradiograms were obtained from the dried blot, and radioactivity incorporated into GST-c-Jun was quantitated by cutting and counting each band in a scintillation counter. Quantitative immunoprecipitation of JNK1 was examined by probing the same blot with a polyclonal JNK antibody (39Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Drs. C. C. Franklin and A. S. Kraft at the University of Colorado). Filipin is fluorescent and has been widely used to localize cellular cholesterol (40Porn M.I. Slotte J.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC grown on glass slides were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde on ice for 15 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with filipin (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed in PBS followed by distilled H2O, mounted in Slow-fade (Molecular Probe), and examined by epi-fluorescent microscopy (Olympus AH-3) using a UV filter. To allow thin sectioning for TEM studies, BAEC were grown on a plastic Mylar sheet (1000A, DuPont) instead of glass slides. Cells were preincubated with vehicle or filipin (5 μg/ml for 0- and 5-min shear groups and 1 μg/ml for 1-h group). Filipin was present during shear. Following shear, cells were fixed for 1 h at 4 °C on ice with 1.6% paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, washed with 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and 3.5% sucrose buffer, pH 7.3, and then post-fixed for 1 h with 1% Palade’s OsO4. Cells were staineden bloc with Kellenberger’s uranyl acetate, dehydrated, embedded in epoxy resin, and sectioned. Ultra-thin sections were examined by TEM, and 26–67 different random fields (each field containing part of 1 or 2 cells) were photographed. As suggested by Schinitzer et al. (23Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), only distinctly flask-shaped, non-coated vesicles (50–100 nm in diameter) found on or within 100 nm of both apical and basal plasma membranes were scored as caveolae. To examine the role of cholesterol in the shear-dependent activation of JNK, BAEC were pretreated with increasing concentrations of filipin or vehicle prior to shear exposure. Treatment of BAEC with filipin did not have any significant effect on static (no shear controls) or shear-dependent activation of JNK (Fig. 1, Band C). In some experiments, cells that were pretreated with filipin were subjected to shear stress in the shear medium containing no filipin. The presence or absence of filipin (1 μg/ml) in the shear medium during a period of 1 h shear had no effect on shear-dependent activation of JNK (data not shown). As shown previously (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), exposure of BAEC to shear stress for 1 h activated JNK1 by 6.5-fold as measured by phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun using JNK1 immunocomplex (Fig. 1 B). Unlike the case for JNK, pretreatment of cells with filipin (0–1 μg/ml for 10 min) inhibited shear-dependent activation of ERK in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B and closed circles in C). As shown previously (15Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), exposure of BAEC to shear stress (10 dyn/cm2) for 5 min stimulated ERK activity by 5–6-fold over the no shear (static) control as measured by Western blot analysis with an antibody specific to phospho-ERK (pERK) (Fig. 2 B). Filipin had minor effects reaching up to 2-fold activation of ERK over vehicle control in the static control cells (p = 0.08 to 0.2, paired Student’s t tests, see also Figs. 3 and 4).Figure 3The inhibitory effect of filipin on shear-dependent activation of ERK is reversible. After preincubation of BAEC with or without 1 μg/ml of filipin for 10 min, cells were washed and incubated again in filipin-free medium (DMEM containing 0.5% FCS) for 0, 10, 30, or 60 min (recovery time). Cells were then subjected to shear stress (10dyn/cm2 for 0 or 5 min) and lysed. The lysates were analyzed by Western blot with a pERK1/2 antibody and densitometry as described in Fig. 2. The 1st two lanes and the corresponding bar graph below show the control experiment (static and shear groups without filipin treatment). The line graph shows the percent of recovery (mean ± S.E., n = 3) compared with control (vehicle and shear-treated group) as a function of incubation time in filipin-free medium. Note that the inhibitory effect of filipin on ERK was not observed any more if filipin-treated cells were incubated in a filipin-free medium for 1 h before subjecting cells to shear stress.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Effects of other cholesterol-binding agents on shear-dependent activation of ERK. BAEC pretreated for 10 min with 5 μg/ml digitonin, nystatin, or xylazine were subjected to shear stress (A, 10 dyn/cm2 for 5 min and B, 5 dyn/cm2 for 1 h).A, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the cell lysates was determined by Western blotting using a pERK1/2 antibody and quantitated as described in the legend of Fig. 2.

(n = 3 each).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we tested whether the inhibitory effect of filipin was reversible. BAEC that were pretreated with filipin (1 μg/ml for 10 min) were washed and incubated in a filipin-free starvation medium for up to 1 h before exposure to shear stress. After 60 min incubation in filipin-free media, shear-stimulated activity of ERK was restored to ∼70% of control (filipin-untreated group) (Fig. 3). Two other membrane-permeable cholesterol-binding agents, digitonin and nystatin, and a lipid-binding agent, xylazine (as a control), were used to examine the specific functional role of cholesterol in the shear-dependent activation of ERK. Digitonin, a cardiac glycoside (42Elias P.M. Goerke J. Friend D.S. Brown B.E. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), inhibited shear-dependent activation of ERK, while raising basal ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). Nystatin, a polyene macrolide antibiotic (43Bolard J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 257-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), partially inhibited (by 42%) shear-dependent activation of ERK while having no effect on the basal activity. In contrast, xylazine enhanced the shear-dependent activation of ERK by 45% without any significant effect on the basal activity (Fig. 4 A). Next, the effects of these agents on JNK activity were also examined. Unlike ERK activity, digitonin, nystatin, and xylazine did not have any significant effect on shear-activated JNK activity (Fig. 4 B). Nystatin and xylazine also had little effect on basal JNK activity, whereas digitonin increased it somewhat (Fig. 4 B). At present, the underlying mechanisms for the differential effects of each cholesterol-binding compound on basal ERK activity are not known. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that removal of cholesterol has specific inhibitory effects on ERK activation, but not JNK, in response to shear stress. Filipin, digitonin, and nystatin can create transmembrane pores and alter membrane permeability. To determine whether the effect of th"

S2R+ cells respond to addition of extracellular Wg by elevating Arm and DE-cadherin protein levels and by hyperphosphorylating Dsh, just as clone 8 cells do. Moreover, overexpression of Wg in S2R+, but not in S2 cells, induced the same changes in Dsh, Arm, and DE-cadherin proteins as induced in clone 8 cells, indicating that these events are common effects of Wg signaling, which occurs in cells expressing functional Wg receptors. In addition, unphosphorylated Dsh protein in S2 cells was phosphorylated as a consequence of expression of Dfrizzled-2 or mouse Frizzled-6, suggesting that basal structures common to various frizzled family proteins trigger this phosphorylation of Dsh.

However, we found another line of S2 cells that does respond to Wg by elevating the Arm protein levels. In this study, we characterized this novel S2 cell line biochemically, and we found that our cell line expresses Dfz2 and Dfz1 proteins, which function as Wg receptors. Therefore, we designated this line as S2R+ (S2 receptor plus). To identify the biochemical changes commonly induced by Wg signaling, we compared the Wg-induced changes in S2R+ and clone 8 cells, both of which express Dfz2 and Dfz1, with those in S2 cells, which express neither. These analyses revealed that Wg signaling induces a common set of biochemical changes as follows: hyperphosphorylation of Dsh, accumulation of Arm, and elevation of DE-cadherin mRNA and protein levels, in S2R+ and clone 8 cells, which express functional Wg receptors, but not in S2 cells, which lack them. We propose S2R+ as a novel cell line for Wg assays in vitro. The Drosophila wing imaginal disc cell line clone 8 (20Peel D.J. Milner M.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 201: 120-123Google Scholar) and DrosophilaSchneider S2 cells (25Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. R. Nusse at Stanford University and cultured as described (19van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Another line of Drosophila Schneider S2 cells (later named as S2R+, which referred to S2 cells with Wg receptors) were obtained from Dr. Tadashi Miake at Mitsubishi-kagaku Institute for Life Sciences and cultured in the same manner as the S2 cells in our laboratory. According to Dr. Miake, the S2R+ cells were obtained directly from Dr. Schneider and stored frozen in his laboratory. To use a homogeneous cell population, a clone of S2R+ cell was isolated from the original S2R+ cells by limited dilution and used throughout these experiments. Wg treatment of clone 8, S2, and S2R+ cells was performed by incubating cells with soluble Wg protein secreted in conditioned medium of S2-HS-wg cells (S2 cells expressing Wg under the control of heat-shock promoter, see Ref.27Cumberledge S. Krasnow M.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), details of which were described previously (19van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R.

Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). pMK-Dfz2 (24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), a Dfz2 expression plasmid constructed with pMK33, was obtained from Dr. J. Nathans (Johns Hopkins University). A plasmid expressing Wg (named pMK-Wg) was constructed by isolating a 1.9-kb1 BamHI-ClaI fragment containing the entire coding region of wg from Wg cDNA (1Rijsewijk F. Schuermann M. Wagenaar E. Parren P. Weigel D. Nusse R. Cell. 1987; 50: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and inserting it into theEcoRV site of pMK33. A plasmid-expressing mouse frizzled 6 (Mfz6) protein, named pMK-Mfz6, was made by synthesizing a 2.7-kb double-stranded cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of Mfz6 (26Wang Y. Macke J.P. Abella B.S. Andreasson K. Worley P. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4468-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and inserting it into the EcoRV site of pMK33. The expression of Dfz2, Mfz6, and wgmRNA in each transfectant was confirmed by Northern blotting with probes specific for each gene (data not shown). The pMK-Wg and the pMK-Mfz6 transfectants used in this study were mixtures of stable clones selected with hygromycin (200 μm). On the other hand, two independent stable clones of pMK-Dfz2 transfectants were used. Wg overexpression was induced in pMK-Wg transfectants by adding 0.5 mm CuSO4 as described (19van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Clone 8, S2R+, and S2 cells grown to 80% confluence were lysed in lysis buffer and used to prepare samples for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The samples were loaded on 7.2% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were then Western-blotted (21Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The antibodies used for Western analysis included the mouse monoclonal anti-Arm antibody N2–7A1 (29Peifer M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 993-1000PubMed Google Scholar), the rat polyclonal anti-Dsh region I antibody (21Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R.

Blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, Amersham, UK). The x-ray films were scanned using a densitometer (Shimadzu Corp. Kyoto, Japan). Total RNAs were extracted by the guanidinium/acid phenol method from an overnight collection of Drosophilaembryos, clone 8, S2, and S2R+ cells, and stable transfectants of those cell lines made with pMK-33 or pMK-Wg. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and Northern blotted as described (33Yanagawa S. Kakimi K. Tanaka H. Murakami A. Nakagawa Y. Kubo Y. Yamada Y. Hiai H. Kuribayashi K. Masuda T. Ishimoto A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 112-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The probe for Dfz2 was the 2.6-kbBamHI fragment from pMK-Dfz2. The Dfz1 (34Vinson C.R. Conover S. Adler P. Nature. 1989; 338: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) probe was the 1.0-kb cDNA prepared by RT-PCR, the details of which are described below. The probes for DE-cadherin, Arm, and d-α-catenin were described previously (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs were selected from total RNAs by using OligotexTM-dT30 beads (Daiichi kagaku, Tokyo, Japan). Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperScriptTM Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (Life Technologies, Inc.). Dfz1 and Dfz2 cDNA fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the single-stranded cDNAs thus synthesized and the following sets of primers: Dfz1 (amino acids 1–326): 5′ primer, 5′-ATGTGGCGTCAAATCCTGTTTATT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TGGACATCATCTGCAGGCGGCCGAG-3′. Dfz2 (amino acids 2–290): 5′ primer. 5′-AGACACAATCGACTGAAGGTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-AGTGAGGTTCATGTACCAGTG-3′. A 2.1-kb cDNA fragment containing the whole coding region of Mfz6 was amplified by RT-PCR with the single-stranded cDNA synthesized from mouse embryonic poly(A)+ RNA and the following set of primers: 5′ primer, 5′-TCAACTAGTCTGGCAAGATGGAAAG-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-TACACTAGTTCAAGCGTCGGAATGGCT-3′. The fidelity of the polymerase chain reactions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. S2R+ cells transfected with pMK-Wg or pMK33 were seeded in 4-well chamber slides and treated with CuSO4 for 24 h. They were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The samples were processed for indirect immunostaining with the mouse monoclonal anti-Arm antibody N2-7A1 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako, Denmark), with the rat monoclonal anti-DE-cadherin antibody DCAD2 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat immunoglobulin (Cappel, Durham, NC), or with the affinity purified rabbit anti-Wg IgG (30van den Heuvel M. Nusse R. Johnston P. Lawrence P.A. Cell. 1989; 59: 739-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Cappel, Durham, NC). The samples were mounted in Vectashield medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed using a Bio-Rad confocal laser system (MRC 600) attached to a Zeiss Axioscope microscope. During our experiments to establish S2 cells that express various mouse frizzled proteins, we found that a Schneider S2 cell line (later designated S2R+) obtained from Dr. T. Miake responds to soluble Wg protein produced by S2-HS-wg cells. Therefore, we obtained the S2 cell line that had been used for identification of Wg receptors (Dfz2) from Dr. R. Nusse and compared these two Schneider S2 cell lines biochemically. In addition, we established S2 cells expressing Dfz2 protein (named Dfz2/S2) and mouse Fz6 protein (named Mfz6/S2) by transfecting S2 cells with the pMK-Dfz2 and pMK-Mfz6 plasmids, respectively. We then compared the effects of soluble Wg treatment on Arm accumulation in clone 8, S2R+, S2, Dfz2/S2, and Mfz6/S2 cells (Fig. 1 A). We thereby reproduced the published results (24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) that clone 8 and Dfz2/S2, but not S2 cells, respond to Wg. In contrast to S2 cells, however, S2R+ cells did elevate Arm (especially the hypophosphorylated form) protein levels in response to soluble Wg protein. In addition, in agreement with the report that Mfz6 does not bind Wg (24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), Mfz6/S2 cells did not respond to soluble Wg (Fig. 1 A, right panel). Comparison of the Arm protein induction kinetics in clone 8 and S2R+ cells demonstrated that S2R+ cells showed slower onset of Arm accumulation (Fig. 1 B). However, both cell lines exhibited marked elevation of Arm protein levels (Fig. 1 B) which plateaued between 150 and 180 min (data not shown) after Wg treatment. In addition, comparison of the Wg dose-response curves of Arm accumulation in clone 8 and S2R+ cells (Fig. 1 C) showed that S2R+ and clone 8 cells are equally sensitive to Wg. Fig. 2 A shows photomicrographs of confluent and subconfluent cultures of these three cell lines. Each cell line has unique cell morphology. Moreover, S2R+ cells do not grow in the medium for clone 8 cells, M3 medium supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) fly extract, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum. In contrast, clone 8 cells cannot be maintained in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (data not shown). Protein electrophoretic profiles of the lysates from S2R+, S2, and clone 8 cells (Fig. 2 B) revealed different protein profiles (S2 and clone 8 cells are rich in 64- and 48-kDa proteins, respectively), further supporting the idea that the S2R+ cell line is morphologically and biochemically distinct from the S2 and clone 8 cell lines. Studies using Dfz2/S2 cells demonstrated that expression of Dfz2 protein could confer Wg responsiveness on the S2 cell line (see Ref. 24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, Dfz1 protein functioned as a Wg receptor in S2 cells (S2 cells expressing Dfz1 protein respond to soluble Wg protein and elevated Arm, see Ref. 24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the Wg responsiveness of the S2R+ cell line could be explained by the expression of Dfz2 or Dfz1 genes. Therefore, expression of Dfz2 and Dfz1 mRNA was examined in S2R+ cells. Northern blot hybridization with probes forDfz1 and Dfz2 (Fig. 3, upper panels) and RT-PCR experiments with specific sets of primers for Dfz1 and Dfz2 (Fig. 3, lower panels) showed that bothDfz1 and Dfz2 mRNAs were expressed in S2R+ and clone 8 cells but not in S2 cells. Densitometric analyses of Northern blots showed that expression levels of Dfz2 and Dfz1 mRNAs in S2R+ cells were about 1/3 and 1/4 of those in clone 8 cells, respectively. We have reported that stimulation of clone 8 cells with Wg-conditioned medium led to the increased phosphorylation of Dsh on serine/threonine residues (these hyperphosphorylated Dsh species migrate more slowly than unphosphorylated Dsh) and that this hyperphosphorylation of Dsh correlated with Arm accumulation (21Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These results led to the hypothesis that this hyperphosphorylated form of Dsh is the active form. By using the two Wg-responsive cell lines, S2R+ and Dfz2/S2, we examined whether or not the Wg signaling induces hyperphosphorylation of Dsh and concomitant Arm elevation. Clone 8, S2R+, S2, Dfz2/S2, and Mfz6/S2 cells were treated with the conditioned media from either S2-HS-wg or S2 cells for 3 h, and each cell lysate was subjected to Western blotting with anti-Dsh antibody (Fig. 4). We confirmed that naive clone 8 cells display several bands of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Dsh and that Wg treatment induces hyperphosphorylation of Dsh (increase of lower mobility bands with concomitant decrease of the highest mobility band) in clone 8 cells. The Dsh image from the longer exposure film (Fig. 4, middle panel) showed that a small amount of modified Dsh was also present in naive S2R+ cells. In contrast, naive S2 cells and pMK-33-transfected S2 cells (data not shown) display a single band of unphosphorylated Dsh protein. Consistent with published results (23Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H.E. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), expression of Dfz2 in S2 cells (even the basal level of Dfz2 expression in the absence of CuSO4) led to phosphorylation of Dsh, and further induction of Dfz2 expression by CuSO4 led to predominant modification of Dsh with an additional mobility shift, but this Dfz2 overexpression could not induce Arm accumulation by itself (data not shown). In addition, we found the following changes in Dsh for the first time in this study. First, expression of Mfz6 in S2 cells, like Dfz2, led to phosphorylation of Dsh, suggesting that basal structures common to all frizzled family proteins (such as the seven transmembrane segments) trigger basal phosphorylation of Dsh in some way. Second, Wg treatment had no effect on phosphorylation of Dsh in S2 cells. This is in agreement with the fact that S2 cells can neither receive the Wg signal nor induce Arm accumulation due to the lack of Wg receptors. In contrast, Wg treatment induced hyperphosphorylation of Dsh (Fig. 4,upper and middle panels) and concomitant Arm elevation (Fig. 1 A) in S2R+ cells, indicating that the presence of functional Wg receptors and the Wg-induced hyperphosphorylation of Dsh are strongly correlated. Third, similar to clone 8 cells, Wg treatment resulted in an increase in the levels of hyperphosphorylated forms of Dsh (the Wg-induced hyperphosphorylation of Dsh) in Dfz2/S2 cells. Therefore, Dfz2/S2 and clone 8 cells showed very similar Dsh phosphorylation profiles before and after Wg treatment (Fig. 4, upper panel). However, Wg treatment did not result in the Wg-induced hyperphosphorylation of Dsh (Fig. 4, upper panel) or Arm elevation (Fig. 1 A) in Mfz6/S2 cells. This may be related to the reported inability of Mfz6 protein to bind to Wg (24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Altogether, expression of Dfz2 protein in S2 cells appeared to first promote basal phosphorylation of Dsh, and next, binding of Wg to Dfz2 further induced hyperphosphorylation of Dsh. The results from clone 8, S2R+, and Dfz2/S2 cells indicate that Wg-induced Dsh hyperphosphorylation is a common biochemical readout in cells expressing functional Wg receptors. Overexpression of the Wg protein in cells is another way to transmit the Wg signal into cells (19van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this case, the Wg proteins synthesized in a cell bind to the Dfz2 or Dfz1 proteins of that cell itself or neighboring cells and thereby stimulate the Wg pathway in an autocrine or paracrine way, respectively. Therefore, the effects of Wg overexpression on protein levels and modification status of Dsh, Arm, DE-cadherin, andd-α-catenin were examined in clone 8, S2R+, and S2 cells (Fig. 5 A). Three cell lines were transfected with the Wg expression plasmid, pMK-Wg, or the negative control vector, pMK-33, and pools of stable transfectants were used. In addition, similar analyses were performed in S2R+ cells treated with soluble Wg for 24 h (Fig. 5 A, right panels). In pMK-Wg-transfected clone 8 cells, addition of CuSO4 induced high levels of Wg expression, whereas very little Wg protein expression was detected in the absence of CuSO4. In pMK-Wg-transfected S2 and S2R+ cells, however, cells not induced with CuSO4 already expressed significant levels of Wg protein, and CuSO4 further elevated Wg expression. In clone 8 and S2R+ cells, which express Wg receptors, pMK-Wg transfectants showed elevated levels of Arm and DE-cadherin proteins compared with their pMK-33-transfected counterparts. In contrast, Wg overexpression had no effect on Arm and DE-cadherin protein levels in S2 cells, which lack Wg receptors (Fig. 5 A). Despite their poor Wg expression, the pMK-Wg-transfected clone 8 cells not induced with CuSO4also produced increased levels of Arm and DE-cadherin proteins. This suggests that a very small amount of Wg protein is sufficient to stimulate the Wg pathway in this system. Similar to the results presented in Fig. 4, Wg overexpression led to modification of Dsh protein in S2R+ and clone 8 cells but not in S2 cells.d-α-Catenin protein levels were not affected in any cell type except for the pMK-Wg-transfected S2R+ cells. Probably, in pMK-Wg-transfected S2R+ cells, very high levels of DE-cadherin protein stimulated cadherin adhesion complex formation, andd-α-catenin proteins were stabilized and thus accumulated in these cadherin adhesion complexes. Treatment of S2R+ cells with soluble Wg also elevated both Arm and DE-cadherin protein levels (Fig. 5 A, right panels). Next we examined the amount of Wg protein secreted in the culture medium of the S2 and S2R+ cells transfected with pMK-Wg (Fig. 5 B). Induction with CuSO4 markedly increased the levels of secreted Wg protein in the culture medium of S2 and S2R+ transfectants. However, comparison of the Wg protein levels in cell lysate and in the conditioned medium indicated that less than 10% of the total Wg protein produced was secreted in the induced S2 transfectants. These results suggested that the paracrine mode of activation of the Wg pathway also occurred in S2R+ cells expressing Wg and probably in the clone 8 cell counterparts as well. On the other hand, Wg protein present either inside or outside of the S2 cells cannot transmit Wg signals into the S2 transfectants, because the Wg receptor is not present in these cells. We have reported that Wg signaling caused elevated DE-cadherin mRNA levels in clone 8 cells (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of Wg overexpression on DE-cadherin, Arm, and d-α-catenin mRNA levels were examined in S2R+ cells. Fig. 5 C shows that, as in clone 8 cells, Wg overexpression in S2R+ cells resulted in elevated levels of DE-cadherin mRNA but not Arm andd-α-catenin mRNAs, further supporting the idea that DE-cadherin is a target for gene expression regulation by the Wg signaling in a variety of cells (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas Arm andd-α-catenin protein elevations are caused by post-transcriptional regulation. To analyze the subcellular localizations of Wg, DE-cadherin, and Arm proteins, S2R+ cells transfected with pMK-Wg or pMK33 were stained with antibody against each protein. The speckled staining observed over the entire cell except for the nucleus (Fig. 6 A) indicated that the Wg protein is located in structures related to the secretory pathway, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and secretory vesicles. In agreement with the Western blotting results presented in Fig. 5 A, Wg expression resulted in markedly elevated DE-cadherin staining at the cell-cell junctions (Fig. 6 C) and cytoplasmic Arm staining (Fig. 6 E) in S2R+ cells. This cytoplasmic localization of Arm is consistent with the notion that Wg/Wnt signaling up-regulates the cytoplasmic Arm/β-catenin pools (16Peifer M. Sweeton D. Casey M. Wieschaus E. Development. 1994; 120: 369-380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These results showed that S2R+ cells exhibit the same biochemical changes, elevation of the cytoplasmic Arm pools, and DE-cadherin accumulation upon Wg overexpression as do clone 8 cells upon Dsh overexpression (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel S2 cell line that expresses Dfz2 and Dfz1 proteins and responds to added Wg protein by elevating the levels of Arm protein. Judging from cell morphology, pattern of growth, and nutritional requirements, this cell line is of S2 type, and was thus designated S2R+. Because the origin of S2R+ cells is poorly documented, we do not know why these two different S2 cell lines appeared. However, the results of this study give some indication of the variation in the behavior of different S2 cell lines. Therefore, if experimental results using S2 cells differ among laboratories, these differences should be evaluated with regard to whether the S2 cells used in different laboratories have different characteristics. By using two novel Wg-responsive cell lines, S2R+ and Dfz2/S2, we tried to evaluate whether or not the effects of Wg signaling that we previously discovered with clone 8 cells, i.e. hyperphosphorylation of Dsh (21Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) and DE-cadherin induction (22Yanagawa S. Lee J.-S. Haruna T. Oda H. Uemura T. Takeichi M. Ishimoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25243-25251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), are generally associated with Wg signaling. As described above, we have shown that they are. In addition, we confirmed that none of these biochemical changes were induced by Wg overexpression or extracellular soluble Wg in S2 cells that lack Wg receptors. Fig. 3 shows that Dfz2 and Dfz1 mRNA were expressed in S2R+ and clone 8 cells but not in S2 cells. Following the procedures described by Bhanot et al. (24Bhanot P. Brink M. Harryman Samos C. Hsieh J.-C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), we tried to show that Wg protein binds to the surface of S2R+ and clone 8 cells but not to that of S2 cells. Whereas the Dfz2/S2 cells showed strong Wg binding, none of these cells showed any significant Wg binding (data not shown), suggesting that relatively little Dfz2 and Dfz1 protein is sufficient to transmit the extracellular Wg signal into cells. We have shown that expression of Dfz2 or Mfz6 induces phosphorylation of Dsh in S2 cells and that a small proportion of Dsh protein is phosphorylated in S2R+ and clone 8 cells. These results suggest that expression of frizzled family proteins induces the basal phosphorylation of Dsh. In this regard, Willert et al. (23Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H.E. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have reported that casein kinase 2 (CK2), which binds to the PDZ domain of Dsh, is the major kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Dsh upon Dfz2 overexpression in S2 cells. Therefore, CK2 may take part in the basal phosphorylation of Dsh in Dfz2/S2, Mfz6/S2, clone 8 and S2R+ cells not stimulated with soluble Wg (Fig. 4). In addition, Axelrodet al. (35Axelrod J.D. Miller J.R. Shulman J.M. Moon R.T. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2610-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) have shown that Dfz1 overexpression led to translocation of Dsh from cytoplasm to plasma membrane. Moreover, Yang-Snyder et al. (36Yang-Snyder J. Miller J.R. Brown J.D. Lai C.-J. Moon R.T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1302-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) have reported that overexpression of rat frizzled-1 results in recruitment of Xwnt-8 and XDsh to the plasma membrane in Xenopus embryos. Thus, it is possible that Dfz2 or Mfz6 expression induces translocation of at least a part of Dsh to the plasma membrane in S2 cells and that this Dsh translocation in some way stimulates Dsh phosphorylation by CK2. However, it is not clear whether CK2 also participates in Wg-induced hyperphosphorylation of Dsh or whether other kinase(s) were activated by the binding of Wg to Dfz2 in clone 8, S2R+, and Dfz2/S2 cells and induced the hyperphosphorylation. In view of the reports indicating association (probably indirect) between frizzled family proteins and Dsh and the binding of Dsh to CK2, it is attractive to speculate that Wg binding induces aggregation of Dfz2 receptors, which, in turn, brings the Dsh-CK2 or other kinase complexes close together, and this aggregation stimulates the Dsh phosphorylation by CK2 or other kinases in these Dsh-kinase complexes. This could explain how Wg induces Dsh hyperphosphorylation in clone 8, S2R+, and Dfz2/S2 cells. However, it is noteworthy that Dfz2 overexpression led to marked phosphorylation of Dsh, but not to elevation of Arm, in S2 cells (23Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H.E. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), indicating that phosphorylation of Dsh, at least by Dfz2 overexpression, cannot activate the Wg signaling pathway by itself. Clearly, further detailed experiments are necessary to evaluate the function of Dsh phosphorylation in Wg signaling. In vitro analyses of Wg signaling with clone 8 cells (19van Leeuwen F. Harryman Samos C. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) have made great contributions to the biochemical analysis of the Wg pathway. However, clone 8 cells absolutely require fly extract and insulin for growth (20Peel D.J. Milner M.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 201: 120-123Google Scholar). Unfortunately, preparation of fly extract is not easy for biochemists who are not working with flies. In contrast, the S2R+ cells grow well in Schneider's medium supplemented only with 10% fetal calf serum and are as sensitive as clone 8 cells to the added Wg (Fig. 1). Therefore, we recommend S2R+ as a new cell line for analyses of Wg signaling in vitro.

Many ER, luminal, and type I transmembrane proteins contain carboxyl-terminal sequences of the prototypes KDEL and KKXX, respectively (5Munro S. Pelham H.R.B.

Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These sequences act as retrieval signals, returning proteins that have left the compartment in which they reside (7Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family (8Francki R.I.B. Fauquet C.M. Knudson D.L. Brown F. Arch. Virol. 1991; 2 (Suppl.): 223-233Google Scholar). Its genome contains a long open reading frame of 9,030 to 9,099 nucleotides that is translated into a single polyprotein of 3,010 to 3,033 amino acids (9Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 297-304Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cleavages of this polyprotein are co- and post-translational and generate at least 10 polypeptides including 2 glycoproteins, E1 and E2 (10Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 931-959Google Scholar). These glycoproteins are heavily modified by N-linked glycosylation and are believed to be type I transmembrane glycoproteins with an amino-terminal ectodomain and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic anchor. For E2, carboxyl-terminal deletions removing its hydrophobic region result in secretion of the ectodomain. This is in accordance with other data proposing that the hydrophobic anchor domain begins at amino acid 718 (position on the polyprotein) (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S.-I. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The situation appears to be more confusing for E1, because a truncated form ending at amino acid 340 is secreted only if it contains an internal deletion between amino acids 262 and 290, suggesting that a second membrane anchor might exist (13Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Suzuki R. Sato M. Aizaki H. Saito I. Miyamura T. Virology. 1994; 205: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, truncated forms ending at amino acid 311 or 334 and containing this internal sequence can also be secreted (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Hussy P. Schmid G. Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virus Res. 1996; 45: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because E1 and its truncated forms do not fold properly in the absence of E2 (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the lack of secretion of some truncated forms of E1 can be because of retention in the ER by interaction with chaperones. E1, like E2, is probably anchored by its carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic sequence, and the amino-terminal limit of the potential transmembrane domain of E1 remains to be established. Studies using transient expression systems have shown that E2 interacts with E1 to form a noncovalent heterodimer (15Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of HCV glycoprotein assembly is low, and a large portion of them form heterogenous disulfide-linked aggregates (16Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Prolonged interactions of HCV glycoprotein complexes with ER chaperones has been observed (18Choukhi A. Ung S. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3851-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has initially been suggested that association of HCV oligomers with calnexin could be responsible for their continued retention in an intracellular compartment (17Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recent data indicate that E1E2 complexes in their native form do not interact any longer with calnexin and are still retained in a pre-medial Golgi compartment (15Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that HCV glycoprotein complexes contain a retention signal for localization in an intracellular compartment. In addition, we have shown that a signal for ER localization of E2 maps to its transmembrane domain (19Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this work was to identify more precisely the subcellular localization of HCV glycoprotein complex and to study the mechanism involved. Immunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins suggested an ER retention. In addition, HCV glycoprotein glycans were not modified by Golgi enzymes, indicating that the ER localization of these proteins is not because of their retrieval from the cis Golgi.DISCUSSIONImmunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins and analysis of their glycans showed that these proteins are strictly retained in the ER. In addition, this retention could be mediated by at least the transmembrane domain of E2. A growing number of ER retention signals have been identified. The best characterized of these motifs are KDEL-COOH, KKXX-COOH and NH2-RR, all of which seem to function by retrieval from post-ER compartments (38Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 39Schutze M.-P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 40Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For KDEL-bearing proteins, deletion of the retrieval motif leads to their secretion. However, these proteins are secreted at different rates and in general very slowly (41Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KDEL motif, as originally proposed (5Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), acts then as a salvage mechanism to return proteins that have left the ER. Resident ER proteins would be largely excluded from vesicular export because their high local concentration favors intermolecular interactions or because of the presence of retention signals (42Sonnichsen B. Fullekrug J. Van P.H. Diekmann W. Robinson D.G. Mieskes G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that export from the ER may occur through a selective mechanism (43Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Such a selective export may involve a di-acidic signal (DXE) on the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins. HCV glycoproteins do not contain a cytoplasmic tail and therefore do not possess a positive DXE-like export signal. However, in the absence of this type of signal, we would expect to detect some slow release of HCV glycoproteins out of the ER. Strict retention in the ER has recently been described for unassembled IgM intermediates and for the uncleaved precursor of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a subunit (26Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Isidoro C. Maggioni C. Demoz M. Pizzagalli A. Fra A.M. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26138-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Retention of these proteins is because of quality control, which contrary to what is usually observed (45Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 46Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), does not involve retrieval in these cases. For HCV glycoproteins, it has been shown that ER retention is not because of quality control. Indeed, HCV glycoprotein complexes in their native form do not interact with ER chaperones (15Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Choukhi A. Ung S. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3851-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, replacement of the transmembrane domain of E2 by the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of CD4 leads to its export to the cell surface (19Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ER localization of some cytosolic proteins can be mediated by a hydrophobic sequence at their carboxyl termini (47Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 48Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18726-18733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these proteins, it has not been shown whether a mechanism for retrieval or strict retention is involved. Similarly, the transmembrane domain of Golgi proteins and part of their flanking regions contain sufficient information for Golgi retention (7Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For these proteins, subcellular localization is not because of retrieval from other compartments but to strict retention. Although the mechanism by which Golgi retention occurs is still unclear, it has been suggested that membrane thickness could play a role (49Bretcher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Such lipid-based mechanism has also been proposed for proteins that are localized in the ER by their transmembrane domain (47Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and ER retention of HCV glycoprotein E2 could fit in this model.A strict ER retention of HCV glycoprotein complexes suggests that budding of HCV particles occurs in the ER. Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope by budding through one of several host cellular membranes. In the case of viruses such as Semliki Forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus, the viral membrane glycoproteins are synthesized and transported to the plasma membrane in a manner indistinguishable from cellular proteins. It is the accumulation of these proteins at the cell surface that is responsible for viral budding (50Griffiths G. Rottier P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Some other viruses, however, bud at internal membranes, such as those of the ER (e.g. rotaviruses), the ERGIC (coronaviruses), or the Golgi complex (Bunyaviridae) (50Griffiths G. Rottier P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 51Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 170: 67-104PubMed Google Scholar). Virus particles are then released from the infected cells either after cell lysis (e.g. rotaviruses) or after transport of virus-containing vesicles to the cell surface and fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane (e.g.coronaviruses and bunyaviruses). For viruses that bud intracellulary, there needs to be an accumulation of the viral membrane glycoproteins, which form the spikes, in the appropriate compartment (51Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 170: 67-104PubMed Google Scholar). A strategy that most of these viruses have developed is to endow the spike proteins with signals for compartment-specific targeting and retention, similarly to normal compartment-specific cellular proteins (52Andersson A.M. Melin L. Bean A. Pettersson R.F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4717-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Armstrong J. Patel S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 567-575PubMed Google Scholar, 54Hobman T.C. Woodward L.

Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the flaviviruses, virions appear in intracellular vesicles (probably modified ER) and are released from cells via the exocytosis pathway (reviewed in Refs. 50Griffiths G. Rottier P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 51Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 170: 67-104PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of HCV, such studies have been hampered by the absence of an efficient cell culture system for its replication. In addition, efficient HCV particle formation has not been observed in transient expression assays, suggesting that essential viral or host factors are missing or blocked. The process of viral envelope formation is not well understood. In most cases, the viral nucleocapsid plays an important role (58Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 59-99Google Scholar), and the icosahedral capsid probably acts as a scaffold responsible for the curvature of the envelope. In some cases, viral membrane proteins are secreted in the absence of the nucleocapsid. This is the case for most flaviviruses (10Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 931-959Google Scholar), which, like HCV, belong to the Flaviviridae family. However such virus-like particles are not observed for HCV.In conclusion, we show that the transmembrane domain of E2 is responsible for genuine retention in the ER without recycling through the Golgi. This indicates that besides the classical retrieval mechanisms described for proteins with a KDEL or a KKXXsignal, retention of native proteins without retrieval can also occur in the ER. Resident proteins in cellular organelles contain some information in their primary structure for determining their subcellular localization. Keeping these proteins in a particular compartment can be achieved either by a strict retention in this compartment or by retrieval. Although most integral membrane proteins of the Golgi seem to be genuinely retained (1Nilsson T. Hoe H.M. Slusarewicz P. Rabouille C. Watson R. Hunte F. Watzele G. Berger E.G. Warren G.

Many ER, luminal, and type I transmembrane proteins contain carboxyl-terminal sequences of the prototypes KDEL and KKXX, respectively (5Munro S. Pelham H.R.B.

Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These sequences act as retrieval signals, returning proteins that have left the compartment in which they reside (7Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family (8Francki R.I.B. Fauquet C.M. Knudson D.L. Brown F. Arch. Virol. 1991; 2 (Suppl.): 223-233Google Scholar). Its genome contains a long open reading frame of 9,030 to 9,099 nucleotides that is translated into a single polyprotein of 3,010 to 3,033 amino acids (9Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Semin. Virol. 1993; 4: 297-304Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Cleavages of this polyprotein are co- and post-translational and generate at least 10 polypeptides including 2 glycoproteins, E1 and E2 (10Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 931-959Google Scholar). These glycoproteins are heavily modified by N-linked glycosylation and are believed to be type I transmembrane glycoproteins with an amino-terminal ectodomain and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic anchor. For E2, carboxyl-terminal deletions removing its hydrophobic region result in secretion of the ectodomain. This is in accordance with other data proposing that the hydrophobic anchor domain begins at amino acid 718 (position on the polyprotein) (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 12Mizushima H. Hijikata M. Asabe S.-I. Hirota M. Kimura K. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6215-6222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The situation appears to be more confusing for E1, because a truncated form ending at amino acid 340 is secreted only if it contains an internal deletion between amino acids 262 and 290, suggesting that a second membrane anchor might exist (13Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Suzuki R. Sato M. Aizaki H. Saito I. Miyamura T. Virology. 1994; 205: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, truncated forms ending at amino acid 311 or 334 and containing this internal sequence can also be secreted (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Hussy P. Schmid G. Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virus Res. 1996; 45: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because E1 and its truncated forms do not fold properly in the absence of E2 (11Michalak J.-P. Wychowski C. Choukhi A. Meunier J.-C. Ung S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2299-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), the lack of secretion of some truncated forms of E1 can be because of retention in the ER by interaction with chaperones. E1, like E2, is probably anchored by its carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic sequence, and the amino-terminal limit of the potential transmembrane domain of E1 remains to be established. Studies using transient expression systems have shown that E2 interacts with E1 to form a noncovalent heterodimer (15Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the efficiency of HCV glycoprotein assembly is low, and a large portion of them form heterogenous disulfide-linked aggregates (16Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G.

Prolonged interactions of HCV glycoprotein complexes with ER chaperones has been observed (18Choukhi A. Ung S. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3851-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has initially been suggested that association of HCV oligomers with calnexin could be responsible for their continued retention in an intracellular compartment (17Dubuisson J. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 778-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recent data indicate that E1E2 complexes in their native form do not interact any longer with calnexin and are still retained in a pre-medial Golgi compartment (15Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that HCV glycoprotein complexes contain a retention signal for localization in an intracellular compartment. In addition, we have shown that a signal for ER localization of E2 maps to its transmembrane domain (19Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this work was to identify more precisely the subcellular localization of HCV glycoprotein complex and to study the mechanism involved. Immunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins suggested an ER retention. In addition, HCV glycoprotein glycans were not modified by Golgi enzymes, indicating that the ER localization of these proteins is not because of their retrieval from the cis Golgi. DISCUSSIONImmunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins and analysis of their glycans showed that these proteins are strictly retained in the ER. In addition, this retention could be mediated by at least the transmembrane domain of E2. A growing number of ER retention signals have been identified. The best characterized of these motifs are KDEL-COOH, KKXX-COOH and NH2-RR, all of which seem to function by retrieval from post-ER compartments (38Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 39Schutze M.-P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 40Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). For KDEL-bearing proteins, deletion of the retrieval motif leads to their secretion. However, these proteins are secreted at different rates and in general very slowly (41Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1094-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The KDEL motif, as originally proposed (5Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), acts then as a salvage mechanism to return proteins that have left the ER. Resident ER proteins would be largely excluded from vesicular export because their high local concentration favors intermolecular interactions or because of the presence of retention signals (42Sonnichsen B. Fullekrug J. Van P.H. Diekmann W. Robinson D.G. Mieskes G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2705-2717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that export from the ER may occur through a selective mechanism (43Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Such a selective export may involve a di-acidic signal (DXE) on the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins. HCV glycoproteins do not contain a cytoplasmic tail and therefore do not possess a positive DXE-like export signal. However, in the absence of this type of signal, we would expect to detect some slow release of HCV glycoproteins out of the ER. Strict retention in the ER has recently been described for unassembled IgM intermediates and for the uncleaved precursor of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a subunit (26Shenkman M. Ayalon M. Lederkremer G.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11363-11368Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Isidoro C. Maggioni C. Demoz M. Pizzagalli A. Fra A.M. Sitia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26138-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Retention of these proteins is because of quality control, which contrary to what is usually observed (45Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 46Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), does not involve retrieval in these cases. For HCV glycoproteins, it has been shown that ER retention is not because of quality control. Indeed, HCV glycoprotein complexes in their native form do not interact with ER chaperones (15Deleersnyder V. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Blight K. Xu J. Hahn Y.S. Rice C.M. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Choukhi A. Ung S. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3851-3858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, replacement of the transmembrane domain of E2 by the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of CD4 leads to its export to the cell surface (19Cocquerel L. Meunier J.-C. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2183-2191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ER localization of some cytosolic proteins can be mediated by a hydrophobic sequence at their carboxyl termini (47Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 48Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18726-18733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For these proteins, it has not been shown whether a mechanism for retrieval or strict retention is involved. Similarly, the transmembrane domain of Golgi proteins and part of their flanking regions contain sufficient information for Golgi retention (7Nilsson T. Warren G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For these proteins, subcellular localization is not because of retrieval from other compartments but to strict retention. Although the mechanism by which Golgi retention occurs is still unclear, it has been suggested that membrane thickness could play a role (49Bretcher M.S. Munro S. Science. 1993; 261: 1280-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Such lipid-based mechanism has also been proposed for proteins that are localized in the ER by their transmembrane domain (47Yang M. Ellenberg J. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1970-1975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and ER retention of HCV glycoprotein E2 could fit in this model.A strict ER retention of HCV glycoprotein complexes suggests that budding of HCV particles occurs in the ER. Enveloped viruses acquire their envelope by budding through one of several host cellular membranes. In the case of viruses such as Semliki Forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza virus, the viral membrane glycoproteins are synthesized and transported to the plasma membrane in a manner indistinguishable from cellular proteins. It is the accumulation of these proteins at the cell surface that is responsible for viral budding (50Griffiths G. Rottier P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Some other viruses, however, bud at internal membranes, such as those of the ER (e.g. rotaviruses), the ERGIC (coronaviruses), or the Golgi complex (Bunyaviridae) (50Griffiths G. Rottier P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 51Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 170: 67-104PubMed Google Scholar). Virus particles are then released from the infected cells either after cell lysis (e.g. rotaviruses) or after transport of virus-containing vesicles to the cell surface and fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane (e.g.coronaviruses and bunyaviruses). For viruses that bud intracellulary, there needs to be an accumulation of the viral membrane glycoproteins, which form the spikes, in the appropriate compartment (51Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 170: 67-104PubMed Google Scholar). A strategy that most of these viruses have developed is to endow the spike proteins with signals for compartment-specific targeting and retention, similarly to normal compartment-specific cellular proteins (52Andersson A.M. Melin L. Bean A. Pettersson R.F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4717-4727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Armstrong J. Patel S. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 98: 567-575PubMed Google Scholar, 54Hobman T.C. Woodward L.

Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). For the flaviviruses, virions appear in intracellular vesicles (probably modified ER) and are released from cells via the exocytosis pathway (reviewed in Refs. 50Griffiths G. Rottier P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 51Pettersson R.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 170: 67-104PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of HCV, such studies have been hampered by the absence of an efficient cell culture system for its replication. In addition, efficient HCV particle formation has not been observed in transient expression assays, suggesting that essential viral or host factors are missing or blocked. The process of viral envelope formation is not well understood. In most cases, the viral nucleocapsid plays an important role (58Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 59-99Google Scholar), and the icosahedral capsid probably acts as a scaffold responsible for the curvature of the envelope. In some cases, viral membrane proteins are secreted in the absence of the nucleocapsid. This is the case for most flaviviruses (10Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 931-959Google Scholar), which, like HCV, belong to the Flaviviridae family. However such virus-like particles are not observed for HCV.In conclusion, we show that the transmembrane domain of E2 is responsible for genuine retention in the ER without recycling through the Golgi. This indicates that besides the classical retrieval mechanisms described for proteins with a KDEL or a KKXXsignal, retention of native proteins without retrieval can also occur in the ER. Immunolocalization of HCV glycoproteins and analysis of their glycans showed that these proteins are strictly retained in the ER. In addition, this retention could be mediated by at least the transmembrane domain of E2. A growing number of ER retention signals have been identified.

Although the extent of the CFTR protein defect, which underlies a particular CFTR mutation, is likely to be uniform throughout all the affected tissues of a CF patient, the severity of the CF pathology commonly varies from one tissue to another (3Cheng S.H.

This heterogeneity in the degree of disease is mirrored in CFTR (−/−) mice (11Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Gabriel S.E. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C.

Indeed, when tissues of CFTR (−/−) mice were subjected to detailed measurements of chloride conductance, it was observed that epithelia with mild CF pathology (e.g. airway epithelia, pancreas), but not epithelia with severe CF pathology (e.g.small and large intestines), expressed such an alternative, non-CFTR-mediated chloride conductance (14Clarke L.L.

Three structurally distinct classes of chloride channel proteins have been identified as potential alternates to CFTR (reviewed in Refs. 16Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholarand 17Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31016-31026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The first class includes the superfamily of ligand-gated chloride channels (e.g. the glycine and GABAAreceptors) (18Grenningloh G. Rienitz A. Schmitt B. Methfessel C. Zensen M. Beyreuther K. Gundelfinger E.D. Betz H. Nature. 1987; 328: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 19Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.H. Pamachandran J. Reale V. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). These chloride channels typically have four transmembrane domains and require assembly to pentamers for proper function. The second class of chloride channels comprises the ClC gene family (20Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Pusch M. Schwappach B. J. Physiol. 1995; 482: S19-S25Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). ClC channels may have as many as twelve transmembrane domains and predominantly function as voltage-gated channels. Their tissue expression varies greatly from one ClC member to another, with mutations in these genes accounting for diverse chloride conductance disorders. Finally, there is a newly emerging family of Ca2+-sensitive chloride channels (CLCAs). The first member of this group is the bovine tracheal epithelium CLCA (termed here bCLCA1) (17Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31016-31026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Two related proteins have since been cloned in our laboratory and their unique posttranslational protein processing characterized in detail. These proteins include the lung endothelial cell adhesion molecule Lu-ECAM-1 (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

D., Elble, R., Ji, H.-L., Schreur, K. D., Fuller, C. H., and Pauli, B. U. (1998) Genomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). Here, we perform homology-based screening of a mouse lung cDNA library using a bovine Lu-ECAM-1 probe (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J.

A 3.1-kb cDNA is identified and found to be highly homologous to bovine Lu-ECAM-1, bovine tracheal bCLCA1, and human intestinal hCLCA1 (17Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I.

The open reading frame encodes a 100-kDa protein product that upon expression in HEK293 cells produces glycosylated protein products of 130 and 125 kDa. These protein products are posttranslationally processed into 90- and 38/32-kDa glycosylated components in a manner identical to Lu-ECAM-1 (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R.

Transfection of mCLCA1 into HEK293 cells combined with whole cell patch-clamp recording confirmed expression of a novel Ca2+-sensitive Cl− conductance. The resemblance between the tissue expression patterns of mCLCA1 and CFTR supports previous electrophysiological data for the existence of two (and possibly more) distinct independently regulated chloride channels in the same cell type and underscores the potential importance of CLCAs in CF (24Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A mouse lung cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with theEcoRI-BglII fragment of the Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA (2.4 kb) (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, and 0.2% SDS solution overnight with agitation. Blots were washed in 2× SSC, followed by several washes in 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS at room temperature for a total time of 30 min. Subclones of each positive clone were isolated by the in vivo excision protocol provided by the manufacturer of the cDNA library (Stratagene). Automated sequencing was performed by the Cornell University DNA sequencing facility using dRhodamine Terminator cycle sequencing on an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). The BLAST program was used for homology searches in existing data bases (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar), and the Megalign of the DNAStar package (Lasergene) for multiple sequence alignment. 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ RACE kit; Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to clone the 5′ end of the mouse cDNA from a pool of mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH). A gene-specific primer 5′-GAA CCT TGC CAG GGG CCG-3′ (nucleotides 2367 to 2350) was employed to reversely transcribe the cDNA from mouse lung mRNA. A second nested gene-specific primer 5′-CCA CGT GCT TCT GCG ATT GCA C-3′ (nucleotides 836 to 875) and a primer recognizing the 5′-terminal tag served to polymerase chain reaction amplify the 5′ end of the cDNA. Polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega). A full-length chimera was generated by fusing the RACE product clone with the longest cDNA clone in pBluescript (Stratagene), using the unique PmlI restriction site in the shared overlapping region. To confirm the existence of the resulting contiguous ORF in lung, primers corresponding to its ends were used to amplify the entire ORF for direct sequencing. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a radioactively labeled HindIII fragment from the mCLCA1 ORF (2.2 kb). Hybridization was done at 65 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt’s solution, and 0.2% SDS solution overnight with agitation. Blots were washed in 2× SSC followed by several washes in 0.2× SSC, and 0.2% SDS solution at room temperature for a total time of 30 min. In situ hybridization was performed on formalin-fixed murine lung and trachea sections with single-stranded digoxigenin-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes (24Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bound probe was detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibodies and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates (Boehringer Mannheim). Sections were counterstained with methyl green. Controls were as described previously by our laboratory (26Gruber A.D. Levine R.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The TNTTM coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) was employed for thein vitro expression of full-length mCLCA1 cDNA. Canine microsomes were used to glycosylate the 35S-labeled translation product according to Stratagene’s recommended protocol. 5-μl aliquots of each of the 50-μl translation reactions were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. mCLCA1 cDNA was cut from the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) using the restriction enzymesSacI and PvuI. The 3′ exonuclease activity of the Klenow polymerase was employed to generate blunt ends, and the resulting fragment was inserted into the tetracycline-sensitive mammalian expression vector, pTet-splice (Life Technologies, Inc.) at the EcoRV site. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with mCLCA1 cDNA cloned into pTet-splice, along with the vector expressing the tetracycline activator pTet-tTak, using the LipofectAMINETMmethod (Life Technologies, Inc.). For electrophysiological studies, HEK293 cells were also cotransfected with pEGFP1 encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH). Cells were analyzed 48 h after initiation of transfection. Proteins prepared byin vitro translation or from lysates of mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE. Western blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies CU8 and CU21, generated against anti-Lu-ECAM-1 peptides (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and used at a dilution of 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline. They were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent for detecting horseradish peroxidase activity (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole cell channel activity was recorded on mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells, superfused at 1–2 ml/min with bath solution (112 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl, 30 mmsucrose, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of DIDS (300 μm), NFA (100 μm), or DTT (2 mm). Borosilicate glass electrodes (tip resistance: 4–9 megaohms) were filled with bath solution containing either 5 mm ATP alone or 5 mm ATP and 1 mmEGTA in the presence of low intracellular Ca2+concentrations (336 μm: free [Ca2+] calculated at ∼25 nm) in experiments designed to examine the effects of ionomycin (2 μm) on channel activity. After seal formation at >1 gigaohm and establishment of the whole cell recording configuration, cells were clamped at +20 mV. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature using an Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments) connected via a TL1 interface (Axon) with a 12-bit resolution to a PC. Records were sampled at 5–10 kHz and filtered at 1–2 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter. The I-V relationship of mCLCA1 was determined using 300-ms voltage steps from a holding potential of +20 mV to potentials from −100 to +100 mV at 10 mV intervals. To normalize the measured membrane currents to the membrane capacitance, the capacitative current transiently recorded in response to a 10 mV hyperpolarizing pulse was integrated and divided by the given voltage to yield the total membrane capacitance (C m) for each cell. Low stringency hybridization conditions were employed in the screening of a mouse lung cDNA library with the ORF of the bovine Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA as probe. Positive phages were purified and analyzed by Southern blot hybridizations to verify specificity. The largest of the isolated cDNA fragments was 2.2 kb in length. It lacked the 5′ end, as determined from sequence comparison with the bovine homolog. The missing 0.9 kb of the mCLCA1 cDNA was obtained using 5′-RACE. The full-length mouse mCLCA1 cDNA was assembled by fusing the RACE product to the 2.2-kb cDNA insert. It is 3.1-kb long and encodes a polypeptide of 902 amino acids (Fig. 1). The mCLCA1 amino acid sequence is 71% identical to both of the previously described bCLCA1 (17Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J.

Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) protein sequences and 53% identical to human intestinal hCLCA1 protein (23Gruber, A. D., Elble, R., Ji, H.-L., Schreur, K. D., Fuller, C. H., and Pauli, B. U. (1998) Genomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). Moreover, the mCLCA1 sequence between amino acids 308 and 365 is 57% identical to an expressed sequence tag from porcine small intestine (27Wintero A.K. Fredholm M. Davies W. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of the mCLCA1 ORF predicts it to be a transmembrane protein with at least two and possibly four membrane-spanning domains (data not shown). A four-transmembrane structure is consistent with the extracellular location of five putative glycosylation sites of mCLCA1 and has been suggested for bCLCA1, Lu-ECAM-1, and hCLCA1 (17Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol.

(1998) Genomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). The sequence alignment of the four members of the CLCA gene family isolated so far indicates conservation throughout the entire length of the sequence, without the compartmentalization of more conserved domains (Fig. 1). However, the N-terminal extracellular domain contains a highly conserved spacing of five cysteine residues, i.e.CX 12–13CX 4CX 4CX 12C (amino acids 187–223). No significant homologies to any other chloride channel proteins were detected using the BLAST program with either the entire mCLCA1 ORF or parts thereof. mCLCA1 cDNA was translated in vitro, and proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A). The unglycosylated translation product resolved as a 100-kDa protein, which corresponded to the size predicted by the mCLCA1 ORF. Using canine microsomes, glycosylation of this protein yielded a product of approximately 125 kDa. The SDS-PAGE pattern of bands was consistent with that observed for the in vitro transcribed/translated Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The translation products of mCLCA1 cDNA-transfected HEK293 cells were further analyzed in Western blots using crossreacting antisera generated against various Lu-ECAM-1 peptides. Protein bands of 130, 125, 90 kDa and a triplet of bands of a size range of 32–38 kDa were specific to the mCLCA1 transfected cells (Fig. 2 B). Antisera raised against the N-terminal region of Lu-ECAM-1 (CU8) reacted exclusively with the large sized bands of 90, 125, and 130 kDa (Fig. 4 A), whereas antisera raised against the C-terminal region of Lu-ECAM-1 (CU21) recognized only the triplet of smaller protein bands (Fig. 2 B). This recognition pattern is similar to that observed for Lu-ECAM-1 (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and suggests that the ORF of mCLCA1 cDNA encodes a precursor protein, represented by alternate glycoforms of 125 and 130 kDa, that is posttranslationally processed into 90-kDa and 38/32-kDa components. The tissue expression pattern was analyzed by probing a multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) with mCLCA1 cDNA (Fig. 3). Unlike bCLCA1, mCLCA1 seemed to be expressed in a wide variety of tissues. There was strong expression in spleen, kidney, lung, and liver and weak expression in the brain. The signal in liver probably represented gall bladder, which was strongly positive by in situ hybridization (24Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two transcripts of 3.1 kb and 5 kb were detected in most tissues, whereas only the 3.1-kb transcript was present in brain and spleen. The isolated full-length ORF corresponded in size to the smaller 3.1-kb transcript (Fig. 3). The relationship of the two transcripts detected is unclear. The larger transcripts may represent a precursor mRNA species or an unknown highly related homolog. In situ hybridization with digoxigenin-labeled, antisense RNA probes yielded a strong staining reaction with respiratory epithelia of the bronchi and trachea as well as with their submucosal glands (Fig. 4). Sense probe hybridization revealed no staining reaction, confirming specificity of the assay. A comprehensive in situ hybridization study of murine tissues other than those of the respiratory system has been published elsewhere (24Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This study reveals high correlation between the tissue expression patterns of mCLCA1 and CFTR. Expression of mCLCA1 in HEK293 cells was associated with the appearance of a novel Ca2+-sensitive Cl− conductance as determined from whole cell recordings in the presence and absence of the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (2 μm) (Fig. 5 A). At low intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations, the basal current at +100 mV in mCLCA1-transfected cells was 2.05 ± 1.09 pA/pF (mean ± S.D., n = 5). Upon perfusion of the bath with a solution containing 2 μm ionomycin, the current increased to 10.23 ± 3.46 pA/pF (n = 5) (Fig. 6). This experimental manipulation had no significant effect on membrane currents recorded from either nontransfected cells, or cells transfected with the pEGFP1 reporter vector alone (Fig. 6). When subjected to whole cell recordings in the presence of 2 mmCa2+ in the pipette, basal currents in mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells averaged 12.01 ± 6.31 pA/pF (n = 5). Perfusion of 300 μm DIDS through the bath reduced the current to 1.84 ± 0.96 pA/pF (n = 5). Similarly, NFA (100 μm) and DTT (2 mm) reduced the whole cell current to 2.58 ± 1.19 pA/pF and to 2.59 ± 1.02 pA/pF (n = 3), respectively (Figs. 5 B and 6).Figure 6Summary of the effects of ionomycin, DIDS, DTT, and NFA on mCLCA1 current expression recorded at +100 mV. In the presence of low cytosolic free Ca2+, exposure of mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells to 2 μm ionomycin resulted in an increase in ICl from 2.05 ± 1.09 to 10.23 ± 3.46 pA/pF (p < 0.001, n= 5). In contrast, exposure of mock-transfected HEK293 cells (pEGFP1 reporter vector alone) to 2 μm ionomycin produced no significant increase in the expressed current (0.23 ± 0.10versus 0.87 ± 0.61; n = 3). In mCLCA1-transfected HEK293 cells internally perfused with solutions containing 2 mm Ca2+, exposure to DIDS, DTT, or NFA inhibited maximally activated currents from 12.01 ± 6.31 pA/pF to 1.84 ± 0.96, 2.59 ± 1.02, and 2.58 ± 1.19 pA/pF, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophysiological studies and, more recently, molecular cloning have identified a bewildering variety of chloride channels (reviewed in Refs. 16Jentsch T.J.

These channels differ in their structure (e.g. transmembrane topology), biophysical properties (e.g. ion selectivity, voltage dependence), mode of regulation (e.g. by ligands, calcium, G-proteins, CFTR, etc.), tissue expression patterns, and associated diseases. The significance of Ca2+-sensitive chloride channels in CF and mouse models of the disease is well established, but their molecular nature has been unknown until quite recently (17Cunningham S.A.

Here we disclose molecular, biochemical, and functional characteristics of such a protein derived from mouse lung (mCLCA1). This protein is homologous to the recently cloned bovine tracheal epithelial bCLCA1 (17Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol.

D., Elble, R., Ji, H.-L., Schreur, K. D., Fuller, C. H., and Pauli, B. U. (1998) Genomics, in pressGoogle Scholar). Sequence alignment and comparison between these four proteins show a high level of homology throughout the open reading frame, but especially in the pattern of cysteines (CX 12–13CX 4CX 4CX 12C) in the N-terminal domain of the protein. A similar pattern of conserved cysteine residues is observed in members of the ligand-gated chloride channel family, albeit the functional significance of this motif has not yet been established (29Ortells M.O. Ortland C. Jentsch T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1992; 18: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (469) Google Scholar). A comparison of the in vitro and in vivotranslation products of mCLCA1 reveals a complex pattern of protein processing. While the in vitro translation of the full-length mCLCA1 cDNA yields a 100-kDa protein, which can be glycosylated to a 125-kDa size product, in vivooverexpression of the mCLCA1 cDNA in HEK293 cells shows SDS-PAGE bands of 125 and 130 kDa. These two bands most likely represent two alternatively glycosylated forms of the full-length protein (21Elble R. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The transfected cells also produce a 90-kDa protein band as well as a triplet of bands in the 32–38-kDa size range. Immunoblots show that the N terminus of the ORF is contained in the 90-, 125-, and 130-kDa protein products, whereas the C-terminal region of the ORF is detectable only in the smaller proteins of the 32–38-kDa size range. The absence of expected immunostaining of the 125- and 130-kDa components by the C-terminal-specific antibody presumably reflects the low relative abundance of these components and the poor conservation of the C-terminal region between bovine and mouse. The appearance of three smaller protein components at 32–38 kDa is similar to those observed for Lu-ECAM-1 and reflects differences in glycosylation of the same peptide backbone (21Elble R. Widom J.

Taken together, these data show an identical posttranslational processing pattern of mCLCA1 to that reported for Lu-ECAM-1 and hCLCA1, generating peptide products of similar sizes and glycosylation (21Elble R.

Our present results show that expression of mCLCA1 in HEK293 cells is associated with the appearance of a Ca2+-sensitive chloride conductance. Under whole cell conditions, the current was outwardly rectified and inhibited by the anion channel blockers DIDS and NFA as well as the reducing agent DTT. The NFA sensitivity was identical to that of the human intestinal homolog hCLCA1 (23Gruber, A. D., Elble, R., Ji, H.-L., Schreur, K. D., Fuller, C. H., and Pauli, B. U. (1998) Genomics, in pressGoogle Scholar) but in contrast to the pharmacological profile previously reported for bCLCA1 studied in a similar eukaryotic expression system (COS-7 cells) (17Cunningham S.A.

These differences between members of the CLCA family of proteins could therefore provide important insights into the regions of the protein required for drug binding and/or channel gating. The tissue expression patterns of bCLCA1, Lu-ECAM-1, hCLCA1, and mCLCA1 are quite different. bCLCA1 is expressed exclusively in the respiratory epithelia of trachea and bronchi (17Cunningham S.A.

Strong expression of mCLCA1 is recorded in tissues with secretory or ion regulatory functions including epithelia of the mammary gland, the respiratory system, gall bladder, pancreas, kidney, uterus, and epididymis (24Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Expression of mCLCA1 is also observed in germinal centers of lymphatic tissues, spermatids, and keratinocytes of the skin, esophagus, and cornea. A precedent for differences in the tissue expression patterns of members of the same chloride channel family exists for the ClC gene family. For example, ClC-1 has been reported to be expressed predominantly in skeletal muscles where its disruption is linked to muscle myotonies (31Steinmeyer K. Klocke R. Ortland C. Gronemeier M. Jockusch M. Gruender S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In contrast, ClC-Ka and ClC-Kb are expressed only in the kidney, ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 mostly in kidney and brain, and ClC-2, ClC-6, and ClC-7 are ubiquitously expressed (reviewed in Ref. 16Jentsch T.J. Günther W. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This heterogeneity in tissue expression suggests differences in function, regulation, and associated disease among the various members of a structurally distinct family of chloride channels. The reported tissue expression pattern of mCLCA1 overlaps with that of CFTR, suggesting that both might contribute to the pathogenesis of CF (24Gruber A.D. Gandhi R. Pauli B.U. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In accordance, Boucher and associates (11Clarke L.L. Grubb B.R. Gabriel S.E. Smithies O. Koller B.H. Boucher R.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Grubb B.R. Vick R.N. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1478-C1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) recently reported that a calcium-mediated chloride secretory pathway was up-regulated in upper respiratory epithelia isolated from CFTR (−/−) mice and that this alternate chloride secretion pathway effectively compensated for the lack of CFTR. Correspondingly, transduction of wild-type CFTR into nasal epithelial cells from CF patients suppressed Ca2+-mediated chloride secretion in these cells, suggesting that the Ca2+-mediated pathway of chloride secretion is switched off once functional CFTR becomes available (32Johnson L.G. Boyles S.E. Nelsdon J. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These experiments clearly indicate that the Ca2+-dependent chloride secretory pathway is of importance in human cystic fibrosis and may prove amenable to pharmacological manipulation and amelioration of the degree of CF disease in specific tissues (17Cunningham S.A.

https://openalex.org/W2046755079,"A cDNA for a novel human papain-like cysteine protease, designated cathepsin F, has been cloned from a λgt10-skeletal muscle cDNA library. The nucleotide sequence encoded a polypeptide of 302 amino acids composed of an 88-residue propeptide and a 214-residue mature protein. Protein sequence comparisons revealed 58% homology with cathepsin W; about 42–43% with cathepsins L, K, S, H, and O; and 38% with cathepsin B. Sequence comparisons of the propeptides indicated that cathepsin F and cathepsin W may form a new cathepsin subgroup. Northern blot analysis showed high expression levels in heart, skeletal muscle, brain, testis, and ovary; moderate levels in prostate, placenta, liver, and colon; and no detectable expression in peripheral leukocytes and thymus. The precursor polypeptide of human recombinant cathepsin F, produced in <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, was processed to its active mature form autocatalytically or by incubation with pepsin. Mature cathepsin F was highly active with comparable specific activities toward synthetic substrates as reported for cathepsin L. The protease had a broad pH optimum between 5.2 and 6.8. Similar to cathepsin L, its pH stability at cytosolic pH (7.2) was short, with a half-life of approximately 2 min. This may suggest a function in an acidic cellular compartment. Transient expression of T7-tagged cathepsin F in COS-7 cells revealed a vesicular distribution of the gene product in the juxtanuclear region of the cells. However, contrary to all known cathepsins, the open reading frame of the cathepsin F cDNA did not encode a signal sequence, thus suggesting that the protease is targeted to the lysosomal compartment via an <i>N</i>-terminal signal peptide-independent lysosomal targeting pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2044801651,"Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) has been shown in studies on vascular relaxation and guanylate cyclase activation to react with glutathione (GSH), generating an intermediate product that promotes a time-dependent production of nitric oxide (NO).

Exposure of vascular tissue to peroxynitrite (ONOO−)1 results in a prolonged relaxation (1Liu S. Beckman J.S. Ku D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1114-1121PubMed Google Scholar) that appears to be mediated through a glutathione (GSH)-dependent regeneration of NO (2Wu M. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P.

Peroxynitrite has also been observed to stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in a thiol-dependent manner in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle preparations (3Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P.

A. 1994; 91: 6702-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), our previous studies detected a different product of this reaction, which was isolated and demonstrated to possess potent vascular relaxant activity (2Wu M. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with GSH detected the formation of what appears to be the same product as that observed in the reaction with ONOO− (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar). Because the biologically active metabolite of these reactions co-migrated on HPLC with a the product of a reaction between nitrosonium borofluorate (NO2BF4) and GSH, the vascular relaxant detected was suggested to be a nitrated product of GSH (GSNO2) (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, additional studies are needed to identify the biologically active substances derived from the reaction of GSH with ONOO−.Peroxynitrite is also known to undergo additional reactions in the presence of physiological buffered systems and GSH. One of the first observed actions of ONOO− on thiols was that it caused oxidation reactions, and an analysis of products of these reactions resulted in a hypothesis that nitrated thiols were a key unstable intermediate formed during these reactions (7Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also provided evidence that thiol radicals seem to be one of the major initial products of the reaction of ONOO− with thiols (9Karoui H. Hansert B. Sand P.J. Tordo P. Bohle D.S. Kalyanaraman B. Nitric Oxide Biol. Med. 1997; 1: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,10Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite appears to react with glucose and other hydroxylated compounds to produce relatively stable products that cause tissue- or thiol-dependent generation of NO and a prolonged relaxation of vascular tissue (11Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lizasoain I. Su Y. Knowles R.G. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12White C.R. Moellering D. Patel R.P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the vasoactive products formed from reactions with glucose seem to be significant only at very elevated levels of ONOO− (13Dowell F.J. Martin W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 338: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite also reacts with CO2/bicarbonate to generate an intermediate that is a potent nitrating agent (14Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem.

A. 1998; 95: 2784-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, ONOO− may interact with additional components of tissues and buffers to form biologically active metabolites. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reaction of ONOO− with GSH generates GSNO2and to examine aspects of how the formation GSNO2potentially participates in the generation of NO from ONOO−.DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study provide evidence for our recent suggestion (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar) that GSNO2 is a somewhat stable product of the reaction of ONOO− with GSH. We have previously observed that a product of the reaction between ONOO− and GSH has the properties of a substance that slowly releases NO, and a product of this reaction was isolated and shown to cause what appeared to be a NO-mediated relaxation (2Wu M. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, GSNO2 was synthesized, and its ability to spontaneously release NO was demonstrated. The data obtained also suggest that nitrated derivatives of glucose or carbon dioxide do not seem to be primary species contributing to the generation of NO from ONOO− under the conditions examined. Thus, GSNO2 may be a key participant in the generation of NO from ONOO− in the presence of GSH (Fig. 7).Mass spectra of a key product that results from the reaction of GSH with ONOO− detected an ion with an m/z of 353 that had a mass spectrum comparable with that of synthetic GSNO2 produced from the reaction of GSH with NO2BF4. The ONOO−/GSH-derived product was clearly different from synthetic GSNO, which was not a detectable product of this reaction. Interestingly, collisional activation of GSNO2 derived from either ONOO−or NO2BF4 with 25 eV did not produce fragment ions, whereas the ion with an m/z at 337 of GSNO readily fragmented at 9 eV. Although the actual origin of the gas phase stability of protonated form of GSNO2 is not yet known, previously reported (21Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar) molecular orbital calculations on model thiol nitrates (RSNO2) suggest that they have a very low barrier for rearrangement to sulfenyl nitrites (RSONO). Thus, it is possible that rapid equilibration between these species provides a level of stabilization sufficient to prevent the fragmentation of GSNO2. The relative stability of GSNO2 in the electrospray conditions could be also influenced by the attachment of proton to GSNO2, a process that is less likely to occur in solution at neutral pH. In a buffered solution, other factors, such as solvation and ionic strength, may contribute to the release of NO from GSNO2. Further studies are needed to establish whether the protonation of GSNO2 enhances its stability in solution.It has been previously reported that RSNO2(R = tert-butyl) species release detectable amounts of NO (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The rate of this decomposition is relatively low (about 105 s−1) and pH-independent in the neutral pH region of acetonitrile/phosphate buffer at room temperature (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a result of molecular orbital calculations, it was suggested that the rearrangement of thiol nitrates (RSNO2) to sulfenyl nitrites (RSONO) followed by the spontaneous decomposition of RSONO was a potential mechanism of NO generation (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar). It was also previously observed that tert-butylthionitrate releases NO through a mechanism that was inhibited by thiols, and this inhibitory effect of glutathione was seen in the present study with purified GSNO2. A reaction of thiols with RSNO2resulting in the formation of nitrite and disulfide was suggested as an explanation for the observed decreased formation of NO (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the release of NO from GSNO2 has similarities with previous observations of NO release from tert-butylthionitrate. Although it has been suggested that nitrated thiols are very unstable species (7Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the observed release NO form GSNO2 over a prolonged period suggests that these substances may be more stable than they were previously considered to be. Because the release of NO2 via a homolytic cleavage of the S-N bond is not likely to occur in thionitrates (21Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar), a question that remains to be answered is whether NO derives from sulfinyl nitrite (GS(O)NO) or sulfenyl nitrite (GSONO) after rearrangement of the initially formed thionitrate (GSNO2) (Fig. 7).The observation that glucose- and CO2/bicarbonate-containing buffers reduced the amount of NO generation from ONOO− in the presence of GSH and the absence of an identifiable effect of these buffer components on the release of NO from GSNO2 are consistent with previous observations on the chemistry of ONOO−. Whereas ONOO− reacts with CO2/bicarbonate to form an intermediate that enhances the efficiency of some of the nitration reactions caused by ONOO− (14Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 16Pryor W.A. Lemercier J.N. Zhang H. Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), data in the present study suggest that this process does not enhance the formation of the key NO-generating species, which appears to be GSNO2. Although ONOO− reacts with glucose (and other hydroxylated substances) to produce nitrovasodilators (11Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lizasoain I. Su Y. Knowles R.G. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12White C.R. Moellering D. Patel R.P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it appears that the products that form may have less of a potential to release NO in the presence of excess GSH than the thiol-derived NO-releasing species that form in the absence of glucose. Thus, the NO-releasing species hypothesized in the present study to be GSNO2 appears to result from a reaction of GSH with ONOO− that is not catalyzed by glucose or CO2/bicarbonate. Because thiol radicals and nitrogen dioxide seem to be key initial products of the aqueous chemistry of ONOO− and thiols (8Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Karoui H. Hansert B. Sand P.J. Tordo P. Bohle D.S. Kalyanaraman B. Nitric Oxide Biol.

J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), perhaps thiol nitration is a result of a radical-radical reaction between these two reactive species.Observations made in the present study on the reaction of ONOO− with GSH are consistent with GSNO2 being a key intermediate that participates in the generation of NO. Our recent studies on bovine coronary (22Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Nitric Oxide Biol. Med. 1997; 1: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and pulmonary (23Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L437-L444PubMed Google Scholar) arteries have already provided evidence that concentrations of NO as low as 50 nm cause a level of intracellular ONOO−formation that produces a prolonged relaxation of these vascular segments as a result of a thiol-dependent process that participates in the regeneration of NO. In addition, GSNO2was hypothesized to be a key metabolite of nitroglycerin over 20 years ago (24Keen J.H. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6183-6188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GSNO2 may be an important biologically active metabolite of NO oxidation and nitrovasodilator drug action. Exposure of vascular tissue to peroxynitrite (ONOO−)1 results in a prolonged relaxation (1Liu S. Beckman J.S. Ku D.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 1114-1121PubMed Google Scholar) that appears to be mediated through a glutathione (GSH)-dependent regeneration of NO (2Wu M. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite has also been observed to stimulate guanylate cyclase activity in a thiol-dependent manner in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle preparations (3Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Tarpey M.M. Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Gore J.Z. Brock T.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whereas the reaction of ONOO− with GSH has been reported to form small amounts of S-nitroso-GSH (GSNO) (3Mayer B. Schrammel A. Klatt P. Koesling D. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17355-17360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 5Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Goodwin D.A. Read N.G. Zamora-Pino R. Feelisch M. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6702-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), our previous studies detected a different product of this reaction, which was isolated and demonstrated to possess potent vascular relaxant activity (2Wu M. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of the reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with GSH detected the formation of what appears to be the same product as that observed in the reaction with ONOO− (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar). Because the biologically active metabolite of these reactions co-migrated on HPLC with a the product of a reaction between nitrosonium borofluorate (NO2BF4) and GSH, the vascular relaxant detected was suggested to be a nitrated product of GSH (GSNO2) (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, additional studies are needed to identify the biologically active substances derived from the reaction of GSH with ONOO−. Peroxynitrite is also known to undergo additional reactions in the presence of physiological buffered systems and GSH. One of the first observed actions of ONOO− on thiols was that it caused oxidation reactions, and an analysis of products of these reactions resulted in a hypothesis that nitrated thiols were a key unstable intermediate formed during these reactions (7Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also provided evidence that thiol radicals seem to be one of the major initial products of the reaction of ONOO− with thiols (9Karoui H. Hansert B. Sand P.J. Tordo P. Bohle D.S. Kalyanaraman B. Nitric Oxide Biol. Med. 1997; 1: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,10Quijano C. Alvarez B. Gatti R.M. Augusto O. Radi R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite appears to react with glucose and other hydroxylated compounds to produce relatively stable products that cause tissue- or thiol-dependent generation of NO and a prolonged relaxation of vascular tissue (11Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lizasoain I. Su Y. Knowles R.G. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12White C.R. Moellering D. Patel R.P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the vasoactive products formed from reactions with glucose seem to be significant only at very elevated levels of ONOO− (13Dowell F.J. Martin W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 338: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite also reacts with CO2/bicarbonate to generate an intermediate that is a potent nitrating agent (14Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem.

A. 1998; 95: 2784-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Thus, ONOO− may interact with additional components of tissues and buffers to form biologically active metabolites. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the reaction of ONOO− with GSH generates GSNO2and to examine aspects of how the formation GSNO2potentially participates in the generation of NO from ONOO−. DISCUSSIONThe results of the present study provide evidence for our recent suggestion (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1038-H1043PubMed Google Scholar) that GSNO2 is a somewhat stable product of the reaction of ONOO− with GSH. We have previously observed that a product of the reaction between ONOO− and GSH has the properties of a substance that slowly releases NO, and a product of this reaction was isolated and shown to cause what appeared to be a NO-mediated relaxation (2Wu M. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kaminski P.M. Fayngersh R.P. Hintze T.H. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2108-H2113PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, GSNO2 was synthesized, and its ability to spontaneously release NO was demonstrated. The data obtained also suggest that nitrated derivatives of glucose or carbon dioxide do not seem to be primary species contributing to the generation of NO from ONOO− under the conditions examined. Thus, GSNO2 may be a key participant in the generation of NO from ONOO− in the presence of GSH (Fig. 7).Mass spectra of a key product that results from the reaction of GSH with ONOO− detected an ion with an m/z of 353 that had a mass spectrum comparable with that of synthetic GSNO2 produced from the reaction of GSH with NO2BF4. The ONOO−/GSH-derived product was clearly different from synthetic GSNO, which was not a detectable product of this reaction. Interestingly, collisional activation of GSNO2 derived from either ONOO−or NO2BF4 with 25 eV did not produce fragment ions, whereas the ion with an m/z at 337 of GSNO readily fragmented at 9 eV. Although the actual origin of the gas phase stability of protonated form of GSNO2 is not yet known, previously reported (21Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar) molecular orbital calculations on model thiol nitrates (RSNO2) suggest that they have a very low barrier for rearrangement to sulfenyl nitrites (RSONO). Thus, it is possible that rapid equilibration between these species provides a level of stabilization sufficient to prevent the fragmentation of GSNO2. The relative stability of GSNO2 in the electrospray conditions could be also influenced by the attachment of proton to GSNO2, a process that is less likely to occur in solution at neutral pH. In a buffered solution, other factors, such as solvation and ionic strength, may contribute to the release of NO from GSNO2. Further studies are needed to establish whether the protonation of GSNO2 enhances its stability in solution.It has been previously reported that RSNO2(R = tert-butyl) species release detectable amounts of NO (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The rate of this decomposition is relatively low (about 105 s−1) and pH-independent in the neutral pH region of acetonitrile/phosphate buffer at room temperature (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). As a result of molecular orbital calculations, it was suggested that the rearrangement of thiol nitrates (RSNO2) to sulfenyl nitrites (RSONO) followed by the spontaneous decomposition of RSONO was a potential mechanism of NO generation (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar). It was also previously observed that tert-butylthionitrate releases NO through a mechanism that was inhibited by thiols, and this inhibitory effect of glutathione was seen in the present study with purified GSNO2. A reaction of thiols with RSNO2resulting in the formation of nitrite and disulfide was suggested as an explanation for the observed decreased formation of NO (20Artz J.D. Yang K. Lock J. Sanchez C. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Chem. Commun. 1996; 1996: 927-928Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the release of NO from GSNO2 has similarities with previous observations of NO release from tert-butylthionitrate. Although it has been suggested that nitrated thiols are very unstable species (7Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the observed release NO form GSNO2 over a prolonged period suggests that these substances may be more stable than they were previously considered to be. Because the release of NO2 via a homolytic cleavage of the S-N bond is not likely to occur in thionitrates (21Cameron D.R. Borrajo A.M.P. Bennett B.M. Thatcher G.R.J. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 1627-1638Crossref Google Scholar), a question that remains to be answered is whether NO derives from sulfinyl nitrite (GS(O)NO) or sulfenyl nitrite (GSONO) after rearrangement of the initially formed thionitrate (GSNO2) (Fig. 7).The observation that glucose- and CO2/bicarbonate-containing buffers reduced the amount of NO generation from ONOO− in the presence of GSH and the absence of an identifiable effect of these buffer components on the release of NO from GSNO2 are consistent with previous observations on the chemistry of ONOO−. Whereas ONOO− reacts with CO2/bicarbonate to form an intermediate that enhances the efficiency of some of the nitration reactions caused by ONOO− (14Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 16Pryor W.A. Lemercier J.N. Zhang H. Uppu R.M. Squadrito G.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), data in the present study suggest that this process does not enhance the formation of the key NO-generating species, which appears to be GSNO2. Although ONOO− reacts with glucose (and other hydroxylated substances) to produce nitrovasodilators (11Moro M.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lizasoain I. Su Y. Knowles R.G. Radomski M.W. Moncada S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 12White C.R. Moellering D. Patel R.P. Kirk M. Barnes S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it appears that the products that form may have less of a potential to release NO in the presence of excess GSH than the thiol-derived NO-releasing species that form in the absence of glucose. Thus, the NO-releasing species hypothesized in the present study to be GSNO2 appears to result from a reaction of GSH with ONOO− that is not catalyzed by glucose or CO2/bicarbonate. Because thiol radicals and nitrogen dioxide seem to be key initial products of the aqueous chemistry of ONOO− and thiols (8Zhang H. Squadrito G.L. Uppu R.M. Lemercier J.N. Cueto R. Pryor W.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Karoui H. Hansert B. Sand P.J. Tordo P. Bohle D.S. Kalyanaraman B. Nitric Oxide Biol.

J. 1997; 322: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), perhaps thiol nitration is a result of a radical-radical reaction between these two reactive species.Observations made in the present study on the reaction of ONOO− with GSH are consistent with GSNO2 being a key intermediate that participates in the generation of NO. Our recent studies on bovine coronary (22Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Nitric Oxide Biol. Med. 1997; 1: 244-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and pulmonary (23Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L437-L444PubMed Google Scholar) arteries have already provided evidence that concentrations of NO as low as 50 nm cause a level of intracellular ONOO−formation that produces a prolonged relaxation of these vascular segments as a result of a thiol-dependent process that participates in the regeneration of NO. In addition, GSNO2was hypothesized to be a key metabolite of nitroglycerin over 20 years ago (24Keen J.H. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6183-6188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, GSNO2 may be an important biologically active metabolite of NO oxidation and nitrovasodilator drug action. The results of the present study provide evidence for our recent suggestion (6Davidson C.A. Kaminski P.M. Wu M. Wolin M.S. Am. J.

Lechan R.M. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Brain Res. 1988; 456: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 7Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Regul. Pept. 1988; 22: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Originally isolated from the hypothalamus, TRH is present in the central nervous system (thalamus, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord,) as well as in the periphery (pancreas, gastrointestinal tracts, and placenta). In the hypothalamus, TRH is synthesized by peptidergic neurons of supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. It is then axonally transported to be stored in the median eminence. When secreted in the bloodstream, it reaches the pituitary where it stimulates the production of thyroid stimulating hormone which in turn stimulates the production of thyroxin (T4) in the thyroid gland (8Gaillard R.C. Schorderet M. Pharmacologie: des Concepts Fondamentaux aux Applications Thérapeutiques. Frison-Roche Slatkine, Geneva1992: 415-448Google Scholar).In addition to this pivotal role in controlling the synthesis and secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and other hormones from the anterior pituitary, TRH has been implicated as a neurotransmitter (9Wu W. Elde R. Hökfelt T. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 142: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). TRH abundantly exists in the central nervous system and exogenous administration of TRH elicits a variety of behavioral changes (see Ref.10Burt D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 553 (. 1989): 188Crossref Google Scholar for a review).The distribution of TRH containing cells, fibers, or receptors suggests a potential role of TRH in the perception of noxious stimuli. TRH is present in the periaqueductal gray, the nuclei raphe magnus and pallidus, and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. TRH-binding sites have been described in the brain, the pituitary, in both the dorsal and ventral horns of the spinal cord as well as in peripheral tissues. When injected centrally, TRH induces a short lasting supraspinal antinociception. The analgesia induced by intracerebroventricular TRH injection is powerful since it is twice as great, on a molar basis, as that of morphine (11Boschi G. Desiles M. Reny V. Rips R. Wrigglesworth S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 79: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This TRH-induced antinociception is detected in models of chemically and mechanically, but not thermally induced pain. On the other hand, intrathecal TRH injections do not affect basal antinociceptive thresholds (11Boschi G. Desiles M. Reny V. Rips R. Wrigglesworth S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 79: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, it is known that TRH enhances spinal reflexes (both in vivo and in vitro) and modulates pain transmission (4Jackson D.A. White S.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 92: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Behbehani M.M. Zemlan F.P. Neuropeptides. 1990; 15: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 13Jackson D.A. White S.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1988; 92: 171-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mode of action of TRH at the level of the spinal cord is unclear, there is evidence suggesting that the TRH-induced facilitation of spinal transmission involves the activation of theN-methyl-d-asparatate receptor (14Chizh B.A. Headley P.M. Neuropharmacology. 1994; 33: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).TRH actions are mediated by the stimulation of specific cell surface receptors. Studies of pituitary TRH receptors have suggested that the TRHR1 receptor triggers the phospholipase C-protein kinase C transduction pathway (3Duthie S.M. Taylor P.L. Anderson J. Cook J. Eidne K.A. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1993; 95: R11-R15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Straub R.E. Frech G.C. Joho R.H. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9514-9518Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A cDNA sequence encoding a G-protein-coupled TRHR was originally isolated from mouse pituitary using an expression cloning strategy (15Straub R.E. Frech G.C. Joho R.H. Gershengorn M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9514-9518Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Subsequently, several groups have described the cloning of rat TRH receptor cDNAs expressed in a pituitary tumor cell line (GH3) or in the pituitary gland (1de la Pena P. Delgado L.M. del Camino D. Barros F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 3Duthie S.M. Taylor P.L. Anderson J. Cook J. Eidne K.A. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1993; 95: R11-R15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, two isoforms of the rat TRHR have been shown to be generated from a single gene by alternative splicing (2de la Pena P. Delgado L.M. del Camino D. Barros F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25703-25708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms are 387 and 412 amino acids in length and they differ in their C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that both cDNAs encode functional TRHRs with indistinguishable electrophysiological responses to TRH (16Toledo-Aral J. Castellano A. Urena J. Lopez-Barneo J. J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using an homology screening approach, a human TRHR cDNA was also cloned (17Matre V. Karlsen H.E. Wright M.S. Lundell I. Fjeldheim A.K. Gabrielsen O.S. Lahrammar D. Gautvik K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of the human TRHR showed high homology with the rat and mouse TRHRs with the exception of the C-terminal region (17Matre V. Karlsen H.E. Wright M.S. Lundell I. Fjeldheim A.K. Gabrielsen O.S. Lahrammar D. Gautvik K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The level of sequence homologies between the putative protein sequences encoded by these cDNAs, excluding the C-terminal sequence, is more than 93%. It seems therefore that the currently available cloned TRHR receptor cDNAs encode species variants of the same functional subtype of TRH receptor.Pharmacological observations, however, suggest the existence of TRH receptor subtypes. A dissociation of endocrine from CNS effects was observed using synthetic TRH analogues. Indeed some TRH analogues containing the C-terminal thioamide group and norvaline or norleucine in position 2 neither bind to pituitary nor to brain receptors and generate no thyroid stimulating hormone release activity. Yet, both analogues affected sleeping time and breathing frequency (18Alexandrova M. Strbak V. Kruszynski M. Zboinska J. Kupryszewski G. Gen. Physiol. Biophys. 1991; 10: 287-297PubMed Google Scholar). The differential effects evoked by TRH analogues with a modified COOH terminus, compared with TRH analogues that have an intact COOH terminus, further support the existence of TRH receptor subtypes (19Faden A.I. Brain Res. 1989; 486: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Comparatively, the TRH analogues in which the integrity of the COOH terminus is preserved (CG-3509, CG-3703, and YM-14673) have shown some efficacy in the treatment of CNS trauma. Whereas compounds with a modified COOH terminus have proven to be ineffective in treating traumatic spinal cord injury despite the fact that such analogues possess similar profile of activity with regard to their endocrine effects (19Faden A.I. Brain Res. 1989; 486: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments also suggested the existence of TRH receptor subtypes. In particular, isoelectric focusing studies of receptors solubilized from the brain or the pituitary revealed respective pI values of 5.5 and 4.9. Although these differences may be caused by tissue differences in post-translational processing, one possible interpretation is that receptors in the pituitary and the brain differ in amino acid sequence (10Burt D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 553 (. 1989): 188Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, electrophysiological experiments and measurements of intracellular calcium concentration suggested that TRH and TRH metabolites present in the brain may act at different subtypes of TRH-binding sites (16Toledo-Aral J. Castellano A. Urena J. Lopez-Barneo J. J. Physiol. 1993; 472: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We describe here the isolation and characterization of a novel rat TRH receptor clone which we have designated TRHR2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning and Sequencing of a Rat Thyrotropin-releasing Hormone Receptor (rTRHR2)The templates for PCR amplification were synthesized using GeneAmp RNA PCR kits (Perkin-Elmer) using 200 ng of spinal cord poly(A)+ RNA and were amplified using the following degenerate primers designed against several G protein-coupled receptors: TM3-4, 5′-GCCAT(C or T)(A or G)(C or G)(C or T)(A or G)TIGAI(A or C)G(A or G)TA-3′; TM7-4, 5′-(A or C)(A or T)GG(C or T)(A or G)TAGAI(C or G)AI(A or C)GG(A or G)TT-3′.The reaction mixture contained 200 pmol of each TM3-4 and TM7-4 primers and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in 50 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 200 μm dNTPs, pH 9.0. The reaction tubes were heated at 95 °C for 1 min and subjected to 39 cycles of denaturation (95 °C/1 min), annealing (42 °C/1 min), and extension (72 °C/1 min).The PCR amplification products of the sizes between 500 and 800 bp were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector from (Promega) and recombinant clones were sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia). The clone pGemT-1–75 was found to have certain degree of homology to rat TRHR-1, and was used to screen a rat brain stem-spinal cord cDNA library in λZAP II (Stratagene) in order to obtain full-length clone (hybridization: 2 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solutions and 0.2% SDS, 65 °C, final wash: 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, pH 8.0, 65 °C).Hybridization-positive phages were purified and the plasmids (pBS/TRHR2) rescued by helper phage mediated excision (20Murray N.E. Brammar W.J. Murray K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 150: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 21Schweinfest C.W. Henderson K.W. Gu J.R. Kotarridis S.D. Besbeas S. Panotopoulou E. Papas T.S. Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl. 1990; 7: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) which were then sequenced after having generated a series of overlapping clones using the Erase-A-Base kit (Promega). To generate a mammalian expression vector, a 1.3-kilobase StuI-XbaI restriction fragment, from pBS/TRHR2 was isolated and subcloned between the EcoRV and XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (InVitrogen). This expression vector was called pcDNA3-TRHR2 which contains the entire coding sequence, 30 bp of 5′-untranslated and 220 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence, in addition to 39 bp originating from the polylinker of pBluescript.Stable TransfectionHEK293 cells in a 10-cm Petri dish were transfected with 20 μg of pcDNA3-TRHR2. After 14 days of selection in culture medium containing 600 μg/ml G418, resistant colonies were pooled. Single clones were purified by 2 rounds of limited dilution in 96-well plates. Clones of HEK293 cells expressing different levels of rTRHR2 receptor were selected using a [3H]TRH binding assay. Transiently transfected cells were also used for the radioligand binding and functional assays.Radioligand Binding AssaysThe cells expressing TRH receptors were harvested, pelleted, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2.5 mm EDTA, with 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Radioligand binding assays were performed on the crude membrane preparation resuspended in membrane buffer (50 mmTris, 0.32 m sucrose, pH 7.0). For the binding assays, membranes were diluted into 50 mm Tris, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Aliquots (80 μl) of membranes were added to 96-well plates containing 1.3 nm of the radioligand ([3-methyl-3H]TRH (NET-705, 64 Ci/mmol))(70 μl) and test compounds (150 μl) at various concentrations in 300 μl total. The total (TB) and nonspecific (NS) binding were determined in the absence and presence of 3 μm TRH, respectively. The plates were mixed and incubated at 25 °C for 90 min then vacuum-filtered through Packard GB/B Unifilter plates (presoaked for at least 2 h in 0.1% polyethyleneimine), washed three times with 1 ml each, of wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mm MgCl2, dried, and counted in the 2.9–35 KeV window in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 50 μl of MS-20 scintillation fluid/well.Values of IC50 were obtained from sigmoidal fits of a nonlinear curve-fitting program (Prism version 2.01 from GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The K i values are determined from the equation K i = IC50/(1+(L*/K d)), where L* is the radioligand concentration and K d is 3.05 nm. The K d was obtained from saturation curves of TRHR2 membranes with [3-methyl-3H]TRH (K d = 3.05 ± 0.6 nm; B max = 12.03 ± 0.99 pmol/mg of protein, mean ± S.D.,n = 3).FLIPR ExperimentA stable HEK293 clone expressing the TRHR2 receptor and GH4Cl neuronal cell line endogenously expressing the rat TRH-R1 receptor were fed 24 h prior to experimentation. On the day of the experiment, 10–12 million cells were centrifuged and gently resuspended in loading solution (loading solution for HEK293 cells: 11 ml of Dulbecco's modified media + 10% fetal bovine serum containing 21 ml of Fluo3-AM (4 mm final) and 21 ml of 20% pluronic acid and, for GH4Cl cells: 11 ml of F-10 media + 10% fetal bovine serum containing 42 ml of calcium green (8 mm final) and 42 ml of 20% pluronic acid) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Following the incubation step, cells were washed three times in 30 ml of Hanks' + 20 mm Hepes + 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4) and resuspended in wash buffer. The cells were plated in 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated black plates at a count of 100,000/well (100 ml), spun at 200 ×g for 3 min, and analyzed using the FLIPR (fluorometric imaging plate reader) system (Argon Laser: 488 nm) to study calcium transients in response to TRH and related compounds. The data was analyzed using the Graph Prism nonlinear regression method to obtain maximum activation and EC50 values.Northern Blot AnalysisA rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) containing 2 mg of rat poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testes was used to study the distribution of rTRHR2 in various tissues. The blot was pre-hybridized at 42 °C for 3 h in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 2% SDS. Hybridization with the full-length randomly primed cDNA (Ready-To-Go DNA labeling kit; Pharmacia) was carried out at 42 °C for 18 h in the solution described above and the final wash was 2 × SSC, 0.05% SDS at 60 °C. The blot was exposed at −80 °C for 7 days to Kodak Biomax film with intensifying screens.In Situ hybridizationAnimals and Tissue PreparationAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼300 g; Charles River, St. Constant, Quebec) were sacrificed by decapitation. Brain, pituitary, and spinal cord were promptly removed, snap-frozen in isopentane at −40 °C for 20 s, and stored at −80 °C. Frozen tissue was sectioned at 14 mm in a Microm HM 500M cryostat (Germany) and thaw-mounted onto ProbeOn Plus slides (Fisher Scientific, Montreal, Quebec). Sections were stored at −80 °C prior to in situ hybridization.In Situ HybridizationSections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (BDH, Poole, United Kingdom) in 0.1 mphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature and rinsed in 3 changes of 2 × SSC. Sections were then equilibrated in 0.1m triethanolamine, treated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in triethanolamine, rinsed in 2 × SSC and dehydrated in an ethanol series (50–100%). Hybridization was performed in a buffer containing 75% formamide (Sigma), 600 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 × Denhardt's solution (Sigma), 50 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA (Sigma), 50 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma), 10% dextran sulfate (Sigma), 10 mmdithiothreitol, and [35S]UTP-labeled cRNA probes (10 × 106 cpm/ml) at 55 °C for 18 h in humidified chambers. Following hybridization, slides were rinsed in 2 × SSC at room temperature, treated with 20 mg/ml RNase IA (Pharmacia) in RNase buffer (10 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) for 45 min at room temperature, and washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC at 65 °C. Sections were then dehydrated and exposed to Biomax MR Kodak film for 10 days. Neuroanatomical structures were identified according to the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlas (22Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, New York1986Google Scholar).RESULTSDegenerated oligonucleotides were designed to the conserved regions of transmembrane domains 3 and 7 of several G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the adrenergic subfamily (23Sprengel R. Eva C. Peroutka S.J. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: G Protein-coupled Receptors. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 153-207Google Scholar). In order to isolate novel G protein-coupled receptors expressed in the spinal cord, reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions were performed using rat spinal cord mRNA as a template. The amplified fragments whose sizes were between 500 and 800 bp were ligated to a cloning vector. After screening of the subcloned fragments by DNA sequence analysis, clone pGemT-1–75 showed marked sequence homologies with known G protein-coupled receptors. The most homologous sequence was the human and rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptors (TRHR) (3Duthie S.M. Taylor P.L. Anderson J. Cook J. Eidne K.A. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1993; 95: R11-R15Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Matre V. Karlsen H.E. Wright M.S. Lundell I. Fjeldheim A.K. Gabrielsen O.S. Lahrammar D. Gautvik K.M. Biochem. Biophys.

Acta. 1994; 1219: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).To obtain the full-length cDNA for this clone, a rat brain stem/spinal cord cDNA library was screened using the insert of pGemT-1–75 as a probe. DNA isolated from a positive phage by helper phage-induced excision and the cDNA insert of the resulting plasmid (pBS-TRHR2) was sequenced. An open reading frame of 352 amino acids was detected flanked by 3′-untranslated region and 5′-untranslated region of, respectively, 220 and 361 bp. The nucleotide sequence and predicted amino acid are displayed in Fig. 1. The relative molecular mass of the predicted protein is 39,500 daltons. Hydropathy analysis of the encoded protein is consistent with the putative topography of seven transmembrane domains, indicative of the G protein-coupled receptor family (23Sprengel R. Eva C. Peroutka S.J. Handbook of Receptors and Channels: G Protein-coupled Receptors. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1994: 153-207Google Scholar). In addition, sequence analysis revealed that the open reading frame of clone pBS-TRHR2 contains several conserved structural motifs and residues found among the members of the neuropeptide receptor family including an asparagine in TM1 (Asn-40), a leucine (Leu-64) and an aspartic acid (Asp-68) in TM2 and a serine (Ser-109), an arginine (Arg-120) and a tyrosine residue (Tyr-121) in TM3. Other motifs of the rTRHR2 receptor gene are the presence of a potential site for N-glycosylation in the amino terminus (Asn-6) and the presence of several serines and threonines in the carboxyl terminus and the third intracellular loop, which may serve as potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinases.An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of known TRH receptors is shown in Fig. 2. The overall amino acid sequence homology between rTRHR2 and the known rat TRH receptor is 50.6%. The homologies between the known rat TRH receptor (hereafter called rTRHR1) and rTRHR2 in TM1 to TM7 are 61, 80, 74, 58, 52, 77, and 71%.Figure 2Alignment of the rat TRHR2 sequence with sequences of rat, mouse, and human TRHR1. The alignment was prepared using the Clustal W. Amino acids identical to those in the rat TRHR-2 sequence are boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, the expression plasmid pcDNA3-TRHR2 generated the expression of specific [3H]TRH-binding sites. No specific [3H]TRH binding sites were generated by the transfection of the vector itself or a control pcDNA3 expression construct encoding the delta opioid receptor. To pharmacologically characterize the rTRHR2 receptor, we generated stable HEK293 cells expressing the rTRHR2 receptor by selecting pcDNA3-TRHR2 transfected cells using G418. Binding experiments were performed on a selected cell line called HEK293/TRHR2. A single class of saturable [3H]TRH-binding site was detected displaying an estimated K d for [3H]TRH of 3 ± 0.6 nm and aB max of 12 ± 1 pmol/mg of proteins. Various TRH-related peptides were used in competition experiments. These experiments using [3H]TRH as a tracer revealedK i values of 2.3 nm for pGlu-3-methyl-His-Pro-amide, 7.3 nm for TRH, 1507 nm for pGlu-His-Pro-Gly, and >10,000 nm for pGlu-Glu-Pro-amide (Table I).Table IKi values (nm) for various ligands at the TRH receptors expressed in GH4C cells and the TRHR2 cloned receptor.HEK293/TRHR2GH4CTRH (pGlu-His-Pro-NH2)7.3 ± 0.67.6 ± 0.3pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH2>10,000>10,000pGlu-His-Pro-Gly1,507 ± 947,195 ± 698pGlu-3CH3-His-Pro-NH22.3 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.1Three independent experiments were performed each with duplicated data points. Open table in a new tab In addition we compared the pharmacology of the novel TRHR2 receptor to that of TRHR1 receptors expressed in GH4Cl cells (25Phillips W.J. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 533-540PubMed Google Scholar) by performing competition binding experiments. The K ivalues measured using HEK293/TRHR2 or GH4Cl cells are summarized in Table I. The affinity of TRH is similar for TRHR2 and TRHR1. For both the TRHR1 receptor, present in GH4Cl cells, and for the TRHR2 receptor present in HEK293/TRHR2 cells, methyl-TRH (pGlu-3methyl-His-Pro-amide) displays a slightly higher affinity than TRH. The ligand pGlu-His-Pro-Gly binds with a better affinity to the TRHR2 receptor (K i = 1.4 μm) than to the TRHR1 receptor (K i = 7.2 μm). This may indicate that TRHR2 is less susceptible than TRHR1 to NH2-terminal modification of the ligand.The rTRHR1 receptor has previously been shown to couple to phospholipase C via a pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαq/α11 protein resulting in the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores. Based on these prior observations, we investigated if rTRHR2 could also activate the phospholipase C effector system.Using different peptidic TRH-derived compounds, the calcium signaling responses mediated by rTRHR1 endogenously expressed in GH4Cl cells and HEK293 stably transfected with rTRHR2 receptors were compared using the FLIPR system. Increasing concentrations of TRH, 3-CH3-TRH (pGlu-3-methyl-His-Pro-amide), pGlu-His-Pro-Gly, and pGlu-Glu-Pro-amide peptides were added to cells expressing either the rTRHR1 or the rTRHR2 receptors to measure calcium responses. As shown in Fig. 3, TRH and 3-CH3-TRH were equipotent at TRHR1 and TRHR2 receptors at stimulating increases in intracellular calcium, whereas pGlu-His-Pro-Gly was more potent at functionally activating the rTRHR2 receptors (EC50, 42 ± 22 nm) as compared with the rTRHR1 receptors (EC50, 1833 ± 223 nm). The pGlu-Glu-Pro-amide peptide, however, displayed no functional binding at either the TRHR1 and TRHR2 receptors. Hence, based on these observations the rTRHR2 receptor is a fully functional receptor coupled to the phospholipase C signaling pathway.Figure 3Stimulation of intracellular calcium mediated by rTRHR1 and rTRHR2 receptors using the FLIPR system. Comparison of intracellular calcium stimulation for rTRHR1 and rTRHR2 receptors in response to increasing concentrations of TRH, 3-CH3-TRH, Glu-His-Pro-Gly, and Glu-Glu-ProA. The mobilization of intracellular calcium was determined by fluorescence measurement using the calcium-sensitive indicator Fluo-3 (HEK293s) and calcium green (GH4Cl) dyes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Non-transfected HEK293s cells were also tested and none of these compounds produced a response (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2013900027,"The crystal structures of family 10 xylanases indicate that the distal regions of their active sites are quite different, suggesting that the topology of the substrate binding clefts of these enzymes may vary. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the rate and pattern of xylooligosaccharide cleavage by the family 10 enzymes, Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp.cellulosa xylanase A (XYLA) and Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase, Cex. The data showed that Cex contained three glycone and two aglycone binding sites, while XYLA had three glycone and four aglycone binding sites, supporting the view that the topologies of substrate binding clefts in family 10 glycanases are not highly conserved. The importance of residues in the substrate binding cleft of XYLA in catalysis and ligand binding were evaluated using site-directed mutagenesis. In addition to providing insight into the function of residues in the glycone region of the active site, the data showed that the aromatic residues Phe-181, Tyr-255, and Tyr-220 play important roles in binding xylose moieties, via hydrophobic interactions, at subsites +1, +3, and +4, respectively. Interestingly, the F181A mutation caused a much larger reduction in the activity of the enzyme against xylooligosaccharides compared with xylan. These data, in conjunction with a previous study (Charnock, S. J., Lakey, J. H., Virden, R., Hughes, N., Sinnott, M. L., Hazlewood, G. P., Pickersgill, R., and Gilbert, H. J. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 2942–2951), suggest that the binding of xylooligosaccharides at the −2 and +1 subsites ensures that the substrates occupy the −1 and +1 subsites and thus preferentially form productive complexes with the enzyme. Loss of ligand binding at either subsite results in small substrates forming nonproductive complexes with XYLA by binding to distal regions of the substrate binding cleft. The crystal structures of family 10 xylanases indicate that the distal regions of their active sites are quite different, suggesting that the topology of the substrate binding clefts of these enzymes may vary. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the rate and pattern of xylooligosaccharide cleavage by the family 10 enzymes, Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp.cellulosa xylanase A (XYLA) and Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase, Cex. The data showed that Cex contained three glycone and two aglycone binding sites, while XYLA had three glycone and four aglycone binding sites, supporting the view that the topologies of substrate binding clefts in family 10 glycanases are not highly conserved. The importance of residues in the substrate binding cleft of XYLA in catalysis and ligand binding were evaluated using site-directed mutagenesis. In addition to providing insight into the function of residues in the glycone region of the active site, the data showed that the aromatic residues Phe-181, Tyr-255, and Tyr-220 play important roles in binding xylose moieties, via hydrophobic interactions, at subsites +1, +3, and +4, respectively.

Xylan, a polymer of xylose residues linked by β1,4-glycosidic bonds, constitutes the major hemicellulose in a range of plant materials (1Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. J. Gen.

The enzymes have extended substrate binding clefts in which the surface residues are linked by an extensive hydrogen bond network. The clefts form deep groves, consistent with their endo-mode of action, and comprise a series of subsites, each one capable of binding a xylose moiety (4Harris G.W. Jenkins N.A. Connerton I.

The subsites that bind the glycone and aglycone regions of the substrate are prefixed by − and +, respectively, and their number is related to the proximity to the site of bond cleavage (the glycosidic bond between the xylose residues at the +1 and −1 subsites is cleaved by the enzyme; Ref. 8Davies G.J. Wilson K. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Catalysis is mediated by two carboxylic amino acids, which function as nucleophile and acid-base residues, respectively (9Withers S.G. Petersen S.B. Svensson S. Pedersen S. Carbohydrate Engineering. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 97-113Google Scholar). Xylanases cleave glycosidic bonds by a double displacement general acid-base-assisted mechanism as depicted in Reaction 1. During glycosidic bond cleavage (k 2) the anomeric carbon of the xylose residue at the −1 subsite is covalently linked to the enzyme’s nucleophile by an ester bond, with the acid-base residue assisting bond cleavage by protonation of the glycosidic oxygen. The covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is then hydrolyzed (k 3) by a water molecule that has been activated by the abstraction of a proton by the acid-base catalyst. The positions of the two key catalytic residues are conserved in all family 10 enzymes (10Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). E+S ↔k−1k+1 ES →k2↘P1 E­P2 →k3 E+P2 REACTION 1 Analysis of active site amino acids that play an important role in substrate binding and in catalysis has been greatly facilitated by solving the crystal structure of family 10 xylanases covalently linked to mechanism-based cellobiosyl and xylobiosyl inhibitors (11White A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4751-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The resolution of the structures of ligand-enzyme complexes has also revealed several active site residues, at the −1 and −2 subsites, which have the potential to play an important role in ligand binding, either through hydrogen bonding with the sugar hydroxyl groups or hydrophobic stacking with the pyranose rings, and other amino acids that influence the position and ionization state of the two key catalytic residues. In addition, the crystal structure of a nucleophile mutant of Pseudomonas fluorescens subspeciescellulosa xylanase A (XYLA)1 soaked with xylopentaose (X5) showed that the oligosaccharide bound to subsites −1 to +4 (4Harris G.W. Jenkins N.A. Connerton I. Cummings N. Lo Leggio L. Scott M. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Pickersgill R.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The structure revealed which residues were likely to play an important role in ligand binding in the aglycone region of the substrate binding cleft; however, the relatively low resolution of the structure prevented precise definition of ligand protein interactions. Recent work in our laboratory has utilized the crystal structure of family 10 enzymes to dissect the functional importance of residues located on the surface of the substrate binding cleft (13Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that Glu-43 and Asn-44 play important roles in xylose binding at the −2 subsite, since removal of these amino acids decreases the enzyme’s activity against oligosaccharides but has no apparent effect on the rate of xylan hydrolysis. It was suggested that the primary role of the −2 subsite is to prevent the formation of nonproductive complexes between XYLA and oligosaccharides. Surprisingly, Asn-182, which is conserved in all family 10 enzymes, appeared to play an important role at the +2 subsite, while the equivalent residue in a family 10 enzyme fromStreptomyces lividans (XYLASL) influenced ligand binding at the +3 subsite (14Moreau A. Shareck F. Kluepfel D. Morosoli R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that conserved residues do not necessarily play equivalent roles in different family 10 enzymes. XYLA, unlike most family 10 enzymes, contains an extended loop after β-strand 7, which is stabilized by a calcium binding domain, although removal of metal binding capacity by this loop did not influence the activity of the enzyme against xylan (15Spurway T.D. Morland C. Cooper A. Sumner I. Hazlewood G.P. O’Donnell A.G. Pickersgill R.W. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17523-17530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the structures of family 10 xylanases are very similar, it is unclear to what extent the topology of the substrate binding clefts of these enzymes is conserved; the importance, in enzyme function, of the discrete subsites that comprise the substrate binding clefts of these glycanases, and the roles of the aromatic, carboxylic, and amide amino acids located within the active site of family 10 xylanases are also not clear. To resolve these issues, we have dissected the topology of two family 10 xylanases, analyzed the function of residues in the substrate binding cleft of Pseudomonas XYLA in both ligand binding and overall catalysis, and, by disrupting xylose binding at different subsites in the pseudomonad enzyme, we have investigated the importance of these xylose binding pockets in the hydrolysis of both complex and simple substrates. The data have shown that there is surprising heterogeneity in the topology of the active sites of family 10 glycanases; the +1 subsite of XYLA appears to play a critical role in xylooligosaccharide catalysis, rather than polysaccharide cleavage, and, in contrast to the glycone region of XYLA, the ligand binding in the aglycone region of the substrate binding cleft is dominated by hydrophobic interactions between xylose pyranose rings and aromatic amino acids. The strains of Escherichia coli used in this study were JM101, JM83, and CJ236 (Bio-Rad). The plasmids and phage DNA used in this study were M13mp19-xynA’ and pRS16 (16Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Huskisson N.S. Durrant A.J. Gilbert H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which both contain the region of xynA that encodes the catalytic domain of XYLA cloned into M13mp19 and pUC19, respectively; pUC12–1.1Cex(ptis) encodes full-length Cellulomonas fimi Cex (17O’Neil G.P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A.J. Miller R.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 52: 737-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli strains were cultured in Luria broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The construction, identification by sequencing, and cloning into the expression vector pUC19 of mutants of xynA’ were described previously (11White A. Tull D. Johns K. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Nat.

To ensure that only the desired mutations had been introduced into xynA’, the complete sequences of the xynA’ derivatives were determined using an ABI 373 DNA sequenator. XYLA and its derivatives were purified to homogeneity, according to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, from 1.2 liters of stationary phase cultures as described previously (16Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Huskisson N.S. Durrant A.J. Gilbert H.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the structures of the mutant enzymes were very similar to wild type XYLA (wtXYLA; data not shown). Cex was purified as described previously (17O’Neil G.P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A.J. Miller R.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1986; 52: 737-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The source and preparation of substrates used in this study were described elsewhere (13Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the exception of 3H-reducing end-labeled xylooligosaccharides and oligosaccharides larger than xylohexaose (X6). Xylooligosaccharides up to X6 were labeled by DuPont at the reducing end to an approximate specific activity of 2500 mCi/mmol, using the method of Evans et al. (18Evans E.A. Sheppard H.C. Turner J.C. Warrell D.C. J. Labelled Compd. 1974; 10: 569-587Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This method is preferred over reduction with [3H]sodium borohydride, since it does not result in the reduction of the terminal sugar unit to xylitol. To synthesize tritiated xylooligosaccharides larger than X6, 1.5 μmol of tritiated X6 (37.5 mCi) were incubated with 1 μg of Cex in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 12 mm citrate buffer (PC buffer), pH 6.5, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 90 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 102 μl. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 30 min and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a 15 × 700-mm Bio-Gel P2 column (Bio-Rad). Oligosaccharides were eluted with distilled water at 10 ml/h at 65 °C. Fractions were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting and then HPLC, as described previously (13Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and those containing purified tritiated xyloheptaose (X7), xylooctaose (X8), and xylononaose (X9) were frozen at −20 °C and retained for further use. Protein determinations and the assays for determining the activity of XYLA and Cex against xylan and aryl β-glycosides were described previously (13Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each assay was performed in duplicate. To evaluate the activity of the two xylanases against xylooligosaccharides, 0.02–460 nm of enzyme (depending on the substrate and the activity of the XYLA derivative) were incubated with 2–14 μm of substrate in PC buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm calcium acetate for up to 200 min. At regular time intervals, a 0.5-ml aliquot was removed, the enzyme was inactivated by boiling for 30 min, and the xylooligosaccharides in the samples were quantified by HPLC as described previously. The progress curves of oligosaccharide cleavage, a typical example of which is shown in Fig. 1, were used to determine thek cat/K m of the reaction using the following equation described by Matsui et al. (19Matsui I. Ishikawa K. Matsui E. Miyairi S. Fukui S. Honda S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 109: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Hrmova M. Garrett T.P.J. Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14556-14563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), k·t=ln[S0][St](Eq. 1) where k = (k cat/K m)[E],t represents time, and [S0] and [St] represent substrate concentrations at time 0 and t, respectively. This relationship is only valid when [E] ≪ [S] ≪ K m. The concentration of substrate in these reactions was ≪K m for xylotriose (X3) and was low enough to prevent transglycosylation reactions from occurring. To determine the frequency with which XYLA and Cex cleaved each glycosidic bond in the xylooligosaccharides analyzed (bond cleavage frequency; BCF), 0.02–460 nm of each of the two enzymes were incubated with the different substrates (5–10 μm) in PC buffer at 37 °C for up to 1 h. Two aliquots were removed, one when approximately 20% of the substrate had been degraded and the other when approximately 80% of the oligosaccharide had been hydrolyzed but before the primary products released had been cleaved. When using X3, xylotetraose (X4), and X5 as substrates, the products could be analyzed when all of the substrate had been degraded, since X3 is very slowly hydrolyzed compared with the tetra- and pentaoligosaccharides. However, when evaluating X6 or larger oligosaccharides, sampling occurred much earlier in the reaction to minimize product hydrolysis. To inactivate enzyme, the aliquots removed were boiled for 30 min and then subjected to HPLC analysis; after eluting the oligosaccharides from the Dionex Carbopac PA100 HPLC column, the eluate was passed through a pulsed amperometric detector so that the oligosaccharides generated could be quantified and then collected in 100 fractions (100 μl/fraction), and the tritium present was determined using a Beckman scintillation counter. Each experiment was repeated twice, and there was no significant variation in the proportion of tritiated oligosaccharide products contained in the two aliquots taken from each sample. A typical example of the elution profile of3H-labeled xylooligosaccharides from the HPLC Carbopac PA100 column is shown in Fig. 2. The BCF and k cat/K m data obtained from these experiments were used to calculate the ΔG of xylose binding at each of the subsites, following the method of Suganuma et al. (21Suganuma T. Matsuno R. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The equation used to calculate the free energy of ligand binding was as follows. ΔG(kcal/mol)=R·T·lnkcat/Km(xa)·BCF(Xa)bkcat/Km(xa−1)·BCF(Xa−1)b/4183(Eq. 2) The kinetic parameters are as follows:k cat/K m (Xa) represents k cat/K m for a xylooligosaccharide of degree of polymerization (dp) a; BCF (Xa)b represents bond cleavage frequency for glycosidic bond b of a xylooligosaccharide of dp a;R is the gas constant (8.314); and T is temperature (Kelvin). The pre-steady state kinetics of the enzyme reactions, using aryl β-glycosides, were determined using stopped flow apparatus as described previously (13Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P. Pickersgill R. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2942-2951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The apparent first order rate constant for the exponential pre-steady state phase of the reaction was determined using nonlinear least squares regression, which fitted Equation 3, where A is the steady state rate constant, B is the extrapolated value of the pre-steady state burst of product release, and k’ is the rate constant for the pre-steady state phase of the reaction. [Pi]=At+B(1−e−k′t)(Eq. 3) Previous studies have clearly shown that the two family 10 xylanases, P. fluorescens XYLA and C. fimi Cex, exhibit very different activities against aryl β-xylosides and xylobiosides (12Notenboom V. Birsan C. Warren R.A.J. Withers S.G. Rose D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4751-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Charnock S.J. Lakey J.H. Virden R. Hughes N. Sinnott M.L. Hazlewood G.P.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6363-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); Cex hask cat/K m values 30–200 times higher than XYLA for these substrates. To investigate whether theC. fimi enzyme is also more active against natural substrates, the relative activities of the two enzymes against both xylooligosaccharides and xylan were investigated. The data, displayed in Table I, showed that XYLA and Cex had similar activities against xylan. HPLC analysis of the products released from xylan revealed that Cex generated significant quantities of xylobiose at a much earlier stage of xylan hydrolysis compared with XYLA (Fig. 3). In contrast, Cex was 20-fold more active against X4, 10-fold more active against X5, and 3-fold more active against X3 than XYLA. Both enzymes exhibited similar activities against X6(Fig. 4). It could be argued that the release of xylobiose from xylan by Cex is a result of the enzyme exhibiting an exo-mode of action as suggested by MacLeod et al. (23MacLeod A.M. Lindhorst T. Withers S.G. Warren R.A.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, the substrate concentration was increased to 1% (w/v), and the products released during the very early stages of hydrolysis were analyzed by HPLC. No xylobiose was detected in the initial products, despite the generation of significant reducing sugar (data not shown), indicating that Cex is a true endoxylanase, and the xylobiose produced is presumably derived from the hydrolysis of xylooligosaccharide products, an observation confirmed in later experiments. The endo-mode of action of Cex is consistent with the crystal structure of the enzyme (5White A. Withers S.G. Gilkes N.R. Rose N.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12546-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which showed that the substrate binding region consisted of a deep open cleft.Table IActivity of glycone active site mutants of XYLA against xylan and aryl β-glycosidesEnzymeSubstrateKinetic parameterk catK m 1-aK m values are mm for the aryl β-glycosides and mg/ml for xylan.k cat/K m 1-bk cat/K m are min−1 mm −1 for the aryl β-glycosides and min−1 (mg/ml)−1 for xylan.min−1WtXYLA1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.Xylan34,1361.2932,063WtXYLA1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.PNPX251860.579076WtXYLA1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.PNPC157503.1WtXYLA1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.DNPC5663815WtXYLAX39CexXylan25,3531.2719,963CexPNPX240560.014287,660CexX327E43A1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.Xylan40,7180.945,242E43A1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.PNPC4610.07E43APNPX275325N44A1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.Xylan29,9960.742,851N44A1-cData originally published in Ref. 13.PNPC188573.3N44APNPX2962.048N44A/E43AXylan7152358N44A/E43APNPC9330.27N44A/E43APNPX2462.419W83AXylan229512295W83APNPC5690.07W83ADNPC420.4105Q213AXylan616788Q213APNPCND1-dND, no activity detected.Q213ADNPC0.40.0313Q213APNPX220.1316D248AXylan6954174D248APNPCNDD248ADNPC0.70.0513D248APNPX21.5611.561-a K m values are mm for the aryl β-glycosides and mg/ml for xylan.1-b k cat/K m are min−1 mm −1 for the aryl β-glycosides and min−1 (mg/ml)−1 for xylan.1-c Data originally published in Ref. 13Charnock S.J.

The tighter binding to the C. fimi xylanase of the substituted aromatic ring results in the efficient formation of a productive complex, and thus glycosylation would be very fast, withk 3 being the rate-limiting step in the reaction, leading to the accumulation of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate and a low K m value for catalysis. In contrast, the poor binding of the aryl moiety to XYLA results in glycosylation being the rate-limiting step in catalysis, hence the high K mvalue, since the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate does not accumulate. This view of the influence of the aryl moiety on catalysis is supported by previous studies which showed that glycosylation and deglycosylation were the rate-limiting steps in PNPC hydrolysis by XYLA and Cex, respectively (13Charnock S.J.

Currently, it is unclear whether the topology of the substrate binding clefts of family 10 xylanases are highly conserved. To investigate the substrate binding clefts of XYLA and Cex, the two enzymes were incubated with xylooligosaccharides with dp of 3–9 labeled at the reducing end with 3H, and BCFs were determined. The substrates were labeled by catalytic tritium gas exchange (18Evans E.A. Sheppard H.C. Turner J.C. Warrell D.C. J.

We utilized low substrate concentrations to prevent transglycosylation reactions.

The crystal structure of the Src family kinase Hck, with its regulatory domains intact, has been solved. It predicts that a conserved residue, Trp260, at the end of the linker between the SH2 and the catalytic domains plays an important role in regulation by the SH3 and SH2 domains. We have mutated this residue and compared the activities of C-terminally phosphorylated wild type Hck and W260A Hck. The W260A mutant has a higher specific activity than wild type Hck. The W260A mutant requires autophosphorylation at Tyr416 for full activity, but it is not activated by ligand binding to the SH3 or SH2 domains. This mutation also changes the accessibility of the SH2 and SH3 domains to their cognate peptide ligands. Our results indicate that Trp260 plays a critical role in the coupling of the regulatory domains to the catalytic domain, as well as in positioning the ligand binding surfaces.

Hck is a Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages (1Ziegler S.F. Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Perlmutter R.M. Mol.

Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Like Src and other kinases of this family, it has the following functional domains (listed from N terminus to C terminus): a membrane binding domain, a unique region, a Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domain, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a kinase catalytic domain, and a negative regulatory site at Tyr527 (Src numbering) in the C-terminal tail (for review see Ref. 3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain binds phosphotyrosine-containing ligands, and the SH3 domain binds ligands containing polyproline type II helices (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr527 by c-Src kinase (Csk) produces an intramolecular interaction between the phosphorylated tail and the SH2 domain that inhibits Src kinase activity (4Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 93: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen J.T.

Src can also autophosphorylate Tyr527, but it is not the primary autophosphorylation site (8Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9Boerner R.J. Kassel D.B. Barker S.C. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9519-9525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The major autophosphorylation site, Tyr416, lies in the activation segment, a flexible portion of the catalytic domain near the active site. Autophosphorylation of Tyr416 leads to enhanced catalytic activity of Src and Hck (4Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 93: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5Superti-Furga G. Courtneidge S.A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen J.T.

SH3 and SH2 domains have both a positive and a negative regulatory role in the activity of Src family kinases. The positive role is thought to be due to SH2- and SH3-mediated interactions with other proteins. These protein-protein interactions allow the kinases to bind to and phosphorylate certain cellular substrates (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). SH2- and SH3-mediated interactions are essential for the signaling properties of Src family kinases; mutations that interfere with the binding of ligands to SH2 and SH3 domains of the kinases disrupt their ability to transform cells (10Hirai H. Varmus H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jove R. Hanafusa H. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1987; 3: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 12Nemeth S.P.

In addition, substitution of the Abl SH2 domain with heterologous SH2 domains results in the phosphorylation of alternative substrates in vivo (14Mayer B.J. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2883-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hence, specific signaling by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases appears to depend on the specificity of the associated SH2 and SH3 domains. The negative regulatory role for SH2 and SH3 domains in Src family kinases arises from intramolecular contacts with the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain. The SH2 domains of Src kinases bind their C-terminally phosphorylated tails (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 4Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 93: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 5Superti-Furga G.

Biol. 1997; 7: R295-R298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction stabilizes an inactive conformation. Genetic experiments first suggested that the SH3 domain of Src was also involved in the repression of catalytic activity (15Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of c-Src and Hck (17Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 19Williams J.C.

Biol. 1997; 274: 757-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) provide an explanation for the involvement of the Src homology domains in enzyme inhibition (Fig. 1 A). There is a linker region (residues 240–263) between the SH2 domain and the catalytic domain that contains a polyproline type II helix that binds to the SH3 domain. This interaction, along with the phosphorylated tail-SH2 domain interaction, is proposed to keep the protein in an inactive conformation (17Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 19Williams J.C.

Several amino acids within the SH2-kinase linker interact with residues in the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain. One of these, Trp260, lies outside of the polyproline helix and appears to be particularly important in maintenance of the inhibited state (Fig. 1 B) (18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). This tryptophan is very highly conserved among Src family and other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, as well as among several receptor tyrosine kinases. In the inactive conformation of Hck, Trp260 points into a hydrophobic region of the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain (Fig. 1 B). Trp260appears to stabilize a conformation of helix αC that is not properly positioned for catalysis. In particular, Glu310 on the αC helix is pointed out of the active site and interacts with Arg385 and Tyr382 in the activation segment. In the active forms of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (20Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar) and Lck (21Yamaguchi H. Henderson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), the corresponding glutamate residues are pointed into the active site. Glu91 of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, the residue equivalent to Glu310 of Hck, is salt-bridged to Lys72, the residue that coordinates the α and β phosphates of ATP. In the inactive conformation of Hck, the side chain of Glu310 is too far from the ATP-binding site to play this role. Autophosphorylation of Tyr416 in the activation segment of Hck leads to increased activity. By comparison with the structures of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and Lck, phosphorylated Tyr416 is predicted to interact with Arg385, causing a rearrangement of the activation segment that allows helix αC to rotate inward (18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). When the helix is rotated inward, Glu310 can form a salt bridge with Lys295, so that the lysine side chain can properly coordinate ATP. Hence, this model suggests that the SH3 domain is important in inhibition of Hck because its interaction with the SH2-kinase linker positions Trp260 to hold the αC helix and Glu310 in an inactive conformation (18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Disruption of the intramolecular contacts involving SH2 or SH3 domains (by ligand binding) leads to enhanced catalytic activity of Hck and other Src family kinases. Binding of a phosphotyrosine-containing ligand for the SH2 domain activates Src family kinases (22Roussel R.R. Brodeur S.R. Shalloway D. Laudano A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10696-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Liu X. Brodeur S.R. Gish G. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Laudano A.P. Pawson T.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), presumably due to displacement of the C-terminal tail. We have shown previously that disruption of the SH3-catalytic domain interaction by HIV-1 Nef, a high affinity ligand for the Hck SH3 domain, or by a peptide containing the polyproline motif, activates Hck 5–50-fold, depending on the autophosphorylation state of the enzyme (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Binding of Nef to the SH3 domain of Hck in vivo stimulates tyrosine kinase activity and leads to transformation of Rat-2 fibroblasts (25Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The p130Cas-related protein, Sin, activates c-Src by coordinate binding to the SH2 and the SH3 domain (26Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Disruption of the interaction between the SH3 domain and the SH2-kinase linker in these cases is predicted to destabilize the interaction of Trp260 with the αC helix, allowing the helix to rotate into the active site, thereby activating the kinase (18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). This model for regulation of catalysis suggests an important role for Trp260. We tested this prediction by producing a form of Hck that contains a Trp260 → Ala mutation and that is phosphorylated on Tyr527. We have compared the activity and regulatory properties of this mutant with those of wild type Hck. Our results indicate a role for Trp260 in the coupling of the regulatory domains to the catalytic domain and in the interactions of the regulatory domains with their ligands. C-terminally phosphorylated Hck (wild type and mutant) was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda cells by co-expression with Csk, as described (18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), with the following modification: after ion-exchange chromatography, Hck was purified on a column containing immobilized adenosine-5′-(γ-4-aminophenyl)-triphosphate. The column was prepared by linking 100 mg of adenosine-5′-(γ-4-aminophenyl)-triphosphate (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) to 5 g of 6-aminohexanoic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The column was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10% glycerol. Hck was loaded in equilibration buffer and eluted with a linear gradient to 1 m NaCl. Peak fractions (as determined by absorbance at 280 nm) were concentrated prior to biochemical experiments. For the production of dephosphorylated Hck, the purified protein was treated with Yersinia protein-tyrosine phosphatase (New England Biolabs) as described (21Yamaguchi H. Henderson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). HIV-1 NL4–3 Nef protein was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli NB42 cells according to published procedures (27Lee C.-H. Leung B. Lemmon M.A. Zheng J. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Saksela K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5006-5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis on an Applied Biosystems automated 431A Peptide Synthesizer. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The sequences of the peptides used are: substrate peptide, Arg-Arg-Leu-Ile-Glu-Asp-Ala-His-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Arg-Gly; SH2-binding peptide (pYEEI), Glu-Pro-Gln-pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Leu; and SH3-binding peptide (PXXP), Ser-Pro-Pro-Thr-Pro-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-Arg-Pro) (24Moarefi I.

Kinase activity assays were performed by two methods: (i) the phosphocellulose paper assay (28Casnellie J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Garcia P. Shoelson S.E. George S.T. Hinds D.A. Goldberg A.R. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out at 30 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 800 μm peptide substrate, [γ-32P]ATP (100–500 cpm/pmol), and 500 μm ATP (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). For the phosphocellulose paper assay, reactions were terminated by the addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatants were spotted onto phosphocellulose paper, as described. The phosphocellulose pads were washed and counted in a liquid scintillation counter to measure incorporation of 32P into peptide. All activity assays were carried out in triplicate. To activate C-terminally phosphorylated Hck by ATP, enzyme was incubated on ice for 45 min in 100 μmATP. For the spectrophotometric assay, reactions contained 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 21 units of pyruvate kinase, and 30 units of lactate dehydrogenase (30Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by addition of 0.05–1.0 μm Hck or W260A mutant Hck, and progress curves were monitored by absorbance at 340 nm in a Beckman DU-7 Spectrophotometer. To ensure that the coupling enzymes were not rate-limiting under our experimental conditions, the amounts of the coupling enzymes were increased and decreased by a factor of 2; this treatment did not affect the rate. Mutagenesis was performed on human Hck in the pFastBac vector (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer’s directions. Oligonucleotide primers designed to introduce a single amino acid change were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 381A DNA synthesizer and purified using Poly-Pak cartridges (Glen Research). Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing using a Perkin-Elmer Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase, sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 370A DNA Sequencer, and analyzed using ABI Prism software, version 3.0. pYEEI and PXXP resins were made by coupling the SH2- and SH3-binding peptides described above (3.5 μmol) to 200 μl of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) in dimethyl sulfoxide overnight at room temperature according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Binding experiments were carried out by incubating 1 μg of protein with 30 μl of resin in 200 μl of final volume in buffer containing 50 mm Tris 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Binding reactions were for 30 min. The resin was washed three times in lysis buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer, followed by resolution using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a Hoefer semi-dry transfer apparatus and detected with an anti-Cys-Src rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescent detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We co-expressed the W260A Hck mutant with Csk in S. frugiperda cells to produce a form of the enzyme that is phosphorylated on Tyr527. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis of this protein (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) confirmed that Tyr416 was free of phosphate (data not shown). We compared the kinetic parameters of wild type Hck and the W260A mutant for phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide substrate (Table I). These experiments were carried out with enzymes that had been pre-activated with ATP and Mg2+, because we found that the W260A mutant is activated by autophosphorylation in a manner similar to how the wild type is activated (see below). The W260A mutant displayed a 5.7-fold lower K m for peptide substrate than wild type Hck, as well as a 2-fold higher V max (Table I). Thus, the specific activity (V max/K m) of the mutant was approximately 12-fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme. TheK m values for ATP substrate were similar for wild type and W260A mutant. We also measured the kinetic parameters of wild type Hck in the presence of Nef. Nef activates the autophosphorylated wild type enzyme (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H.

Nef also lowers the K m for ATP from 100 to 32 μm, but because of the millimolar concentrations of ATP in the cell, this is unlikely to be a regulatory mechanism in vivo.Table IKinetic parameters for Hck and W260A mutant(K m)V maxATPpeptideμmμmol/min/mgWild type100 ± 12758 ± 230.79 ± 0.03Wild type plus Nef32 ± 8366 ± 1561.2 ± 0.07W260A100 ± 26132 ± 291.7 ± 0.02Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay. All enzymes were activated by preincubation with ATP (to allow autophosphorylation at Tyr416) prior to kinetic analysis. We showed previously that C-terminally phosphorylated wild type Hck is activated approximately 10-fold upon incubation with ATP and that this activation process involves a relatively slow intermolecular autophosphorylation at Tyr416 (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We measured the activity of W260A Hck before and after incubation with ATP under conditions that activate the wild type enzyme. Fig. 2 shows that upon incubation with ATP, W260A Hck is activated 9-fold (relative to C-terminally phosphorylated W260A). Thus, the C-terminally phosphorylated W260A mutant has intrinsically higher activity than C-terminally phosphorylated wild type Hck, but it is still subject to regulation by autophosphorylation at Tyr416. Wild type Hck is activated by binding of ligands to the SH2 and SH3 domains, even after the enzyme has been autophosphorylated at Tyr416 (Fig. 2 and Ref. 24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We next tested the ability of such ligands to activate W260A Hck. Fig. 2 shows that the autophosphorylated mutant is not further activated by binding of a pYEEI-containing peptide to its SH2 domain or by binding of either a polyproline (PXXP)-containing peptide or Nef to its SH3 domain. We did not observe any activation of W260A Hck by these peptides in the concentration range 2–50 μm (data not shown). This lack of activation is not due to an inability to bind these ligands in the W260A mutant (see below). The lack of activation of W260A Hck upon ligand binding to the regulatory domains suggests that Trp260 plays a role in the coupling of the regulatory domains to the catalytic domain. The SH2 and SH3 domains of Hck appear to be mutually dependent with regard to their ability to modulate enzymatic activity. An intact SH3 domain is necessary for negative regulation by the phosphorylated C-terminal tail (15Murphy S.M. Bergman M. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5290-5300Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Furthermore, using surface plasmon resonance, we observed that C-terminally phosphorylated Hck had a higher apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for Nef than the dephosphorylated enzyme (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Thus, release of phosphorylated Tyr527 from the SH2 domain of Hck appears to increase the accessibility of the SH3 domain. We therefore investigated the effect of the W260A mutation on the accessibility of the ligand binding surfaces of the SH2 and SH3 domains. In these experiments, we compared the ability of wild type and W260A Hck to bind to immobilized ligands for the SH2 domain (a pYEEI-containing peptide) and the SH3 domain (a polyproline-containing peptide). Although these peptides can bind to the regulatory domains of Hck (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), under the conditions of this assay C-terminally phosphorylated wild type Hck did not bind appreciably to the immobilized pYEEI peptide (Fig. 3,lane 2) or to the immobilized PXXP peptide (Fig. 3, lane 4). Hck that had been dephosphorylated at Tyr527 was able to bind to the pYEEI resin (Fig. 3,lane 6). In contrast to results for wild type Hck, C-terminally phosphorylated W260A mutant bound efficiently to immobilized pYEEI peptide or PXXP peptide (Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 5, respectively). The increased accessibility of the SH2 and SH3 domains for ligands suggests that the W260A mutation destabilizes the intramolecular interactions that maintain the inactive conformation. We carried out similar experiments on C-terminally phosphorylated Hck that had been allowed to autophosphorylate on Tyr416. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether the C-terminal tail becomes disengaged from the SH2 domain after autophosphorylation on Tyr416. Previous experiments on Src demonstrated that a form of Src with an intramolecular interaction between the SH2 domain and the phosphorylated tail was able to autophosphorylate at Tyr416 (9Boerner R.J. Kassel D.B. Barker S.C. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9519-9525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We wished to address the question of whether autophosphorylation leads to a subsequent disruption of the SH2-tail interaction. We compared binding of Hck to immobilized pYEEI resin before and after autophosphorylation. In our assay system, autophosphorylation does not dramatically change the binding of the SH2 domain to the pYEEI resin, suggesting that the phosphorylated tail is not released from the SH2 domain after autophosphorylation (Fig. 3,lanes 2 and 7). Similar results were obtained for the Trp260 mutant of Hck (data not shown). When the activity of C-terminally phosphorylated Hck is measured without ATP pretreatment, a lag is observed in substrate phosphorylation (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This induction time is due to autophosphorylation at Tyr416, and the length of the induction time depends on Hck concentration, as predicted for an intermolecular process. Dephosphorylation at Tyr527 significantly reduces the induction time (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We incubated W260A Hck with peptide substrate without ATP pretreatment and measured the induction time for autoactivation. The induction time of the W260A mutant is reduced relative to wild type Hck (Fig. 4 A). For example, at an enzyme concentration of 0.5 μm, the induction times for wild type Hck and W260A were 8 min and 30 s, respectively (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, at an enzyme concentration of 0.05 μm, the induction times for wild type Hck and W260A were 24 and 5 min, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The induction time for W260A Hck is still dependent on enzyme concentration (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that autophosphorylation is intermolecular under these experimental conditions. We used a spectrophotometric assay to confirm that autophosphorylation occurs in the mutant. The time course for W260A autophosphorylation showed a lag that corresponds to the lag observed for peptide phosphorylation (a representative trace is shown in Fig. 4 B). Thus, the results for W260A Hck agree with previous studies on dephosphorylated Hck (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) and suggest that destabilizing the interaction between the SH3 and catalytic domains, with concomitant disruption of the SH2-tail interaction (Fig. 3), leads to more rapid autophosphorylation. The inactive forms of Src family kinases are maintained by intramolecular interactions involving both the SH2 and SH3 domains (17Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 19Williams J.C.

Disruption of either of these interactions is predicted to cause enzyme activation (6Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R295-R298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In v-Src, the product of the transforming gene from Rous sarcoma virus, the C-terminal tail is missing and the enzyme is constitutively active. v-Src also contains amino acid substitutions at Arg95 and Thr96, two residues in the SH3 domain that interact with the SH2-kinase linker and the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain. These mutations are expected to disrupt the SH3-catalytic domain interaction, destabilizing the repressed form of Src (6Nguyen J.T. Lim W.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Mayer B.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R295-R298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Displacement of the SH3 domain of Hck by Nef leads to a maximum activation of the enzyme, consistent with a central role for the SH3-catalytic domain interaction in regulating Hck (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). We report here that mutation of Trp260, a conserved residue in the SH2-kinase linker, leads to changes in the regulatory properties of Hck. Mutation of Trp260 has four main effects: (i) it increases the basal activity of Hck; (ii) it shortens the time required for autophosphorylation; (iii) it renders Hck insensitive to added SH2 or SH3 ligands; and (iv) it changes the accessibility of the ligand binding surfaces of the SH2 and SH3 domains. These observations are consistent with two major roles for Trp260. First, Trp260 interacts with the αC-helix in the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain. Mutation of Trp260 disrupts this interaction, allowing the activation segment and helix αC to adopt a conformation that is competent for kinase activity. Second, Trp260 appears to play a role in positioning the SH2 and SH3 domains for intra- and intermolecular interactions. Our results are consistent with those of Gonfloni et al. (31Gonfloni S. Williams J.C. Hattula K. Weijland A. Wierenga R.K. Superti-Furga G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), who showed that a W260A mutant of c-Src has impaired regulation when expressed in yeast. The W260A mutant of Hck has a higher basal activity than the wild type, but the mutant still requires autophosphorylation at Tyr416for full activity (Table I and Fig. 4). The autoactivation process occurs more rapidly for the mutant than for the wild type (Fig. 4); this is similar to the effect we observed for Hck that had been dephosphorylated at Tyr527 (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). These results further establish the importance of the phosphorylation state of the activation segment for controlling Hck activity, as seen previously by mutagenic analysis of c-Src and Lck (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 32Ferracini R. Brugge J.S. Oncogene Res. 1990; 5: 205-219PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Addition of ligands for the Hck SH2 or SH3 domains gave no additional activation (over the level seen in autophosphorylated W260A Hck) (Fig. 2). Thus, although the regulatory domains do not appear to exert their inhibitory effects in the mutant, autophosphorylation at Tyr416 must still occur for maximal activity. This is similar to our recent results for wild type Hck stimulated by Nef, where activation by autophosphorylation at Tyr416 can still be observed, although the process is very rapid relative to Hck alone. 2M. LaFevre-Bernt, M. Porter, and W. T. Miller, unpublished observations. The maximum level of activity observed for the autophosphorylated W260A mutant is similar to that seen for the wild type enzyme that has been fully activated by addition of Nef (Table I). Autophosphorylation of Src family kinases appears to be predominantly an intermolecular event. However, the flexibility of the activation segment (containing Tyr416) suggests the possibility of intramolecular autophosphorylation if the regulatory domains are removed. Does this explain the more rapid autophosphorylation of the W260A mutant? Our results shown in Fig. 4 A argue against this interpretation, because the induction time for W260A activation depends on the protein concentration. Intramolecular autophosphorylation would yield a first-order progress curve for peptide phosphorylation, and the induction time would be independent of protein concentration. We have also recently observed that the induction time for activation of wild type Hck in the presence of Nef depends on protein concentration.2 These results indicate that, at least at these concentrations of Hck (0.01 μm-1.0 μm), intramolecular autophosphorylation is unlikely to play a major role in enzyme activation. The concentration of Src in NIH3T3 cells has been estimated to be approximately 1.0 μm, based on a cell volume of 10–15 femtoliters and 10,000 molecules of Src/cell. 3S. Courtneidge, personal communication. Furthermore, plasma membrane localization of Src and formation of signaling complexes at the membrane would tend to increase the local concentration (3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Thus, under normal physiological conditions, intramolecular autophosphorylation is unlikely to be a major mode of regulation in vivo. Mutation of Trp260 in Hck also changes the interactions of the SH2 and SH3 domains with their respective ligands. The ligand-binding surface of both domains is more accessible in W260A Hck than in wild type Hck (Fig. 3). A change in accessibility of the SH3 domain is not surprising, given the proximity of Trp260 to the polyproline type II helix that is bound by the SH3 domain of Hck. The W260A mutation also destabilizes the interaction between the phosphorylated tail and the SH2 domain of Hck (Fig. 3), a site approximately 40 Å away in the three-dimensional structure (18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). A similar effect has been observed for Src, where a mutant lacking the SH3 domain bound more tightly to immobilized pYEEI peptide (16Superti-Furga G. Fumagalli S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2625-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The interactions between the SH3 domain, the linker, and the N-terminal lobe of the catalytic domain are extensive and predominantly hydrophobic (17Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 18Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, 19Williams J.C.

In contrast, the interactions between the SH2 and catalytic domains are polar in character. The SH3 domain interactions may play the dominant role in maintaining the inactive state; disrupting these interactions may destabilize the regulatory apparatus, leading to increased accessibility of the SH2 domain. Our results demonstrate the importance of Trp260 in maintaining the proper geometry of both the SH2 and SH3 domain ligand binding surfaces for maximal interaction with their intramolecular ligands and point to the interdependence of the SH2 and SH3 domains in Src family kinase regulation. The interdependence of the intramolecular SH2 and SH3 domain interactions indicates that the repressed conformations of Src family kinases are subject to activation by a variety of cellular signals. Such signals include dephosphorylation of Tyr527(e.g. CD45 phosphatase dephosphorylating Lck (34Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar)); engagement of the SH2 domain (e.g. PDGF receptor activating Src (35Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar)); engagement of the SH3 domain (e.g. Nef activation of Hck (24Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar)); or simultaneous binding of the SH2 and SH3 domains (e.g. Sin activating Src (26Alexandropoulos K. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1341-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar)). Src kinases seem to be particularly sensitive to SH3 domain engagement, and activation of Src kinases by this process may prove to be a widespread feature of signaling by these kinases."

The major cause of non-melanoma skin cancer is exposure to sunlight, most notably to the UVB (280–320 nm) part of the spectrum (1Hall E.J. Astor M. Bedford J. Borek C. Curtis S.B. Fry M. Geard C.

The possible mechanisms of UV radiation-induced skin carcinogenesis are thought to be UV-induced genetic and epigenetic changes (2Anathaswamy H.N. Pierceall W.E. Photochem.

Genetic changes, such as activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppresser genes, lead to tumor initiation (2Anathaswamy H.N. Pierceall W.E. Photochem.

Epigenetic changes, such as induced expression of certain genes that may be involved in cell proliferation, appear to play a role in tumor promotion (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar, 5Matsui M.S. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H. Photocarcinogenesis by Ultraviolet A and B.

Although UVC (200–280 nm) is also a potent photocarcinogen, its biological significance may be less important, since it does not reach the earth’s surface (7Matsui M.S. DeLeo V.A. Mukhtar H. Skin Cancer: Mechanisms and Human Relevance. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1995: 21-30Google Scholar). However, previous UV studies have been conducted mostly using 254 nm UVC. Those studies showed that UVC could induce the expression of number of genes, including c-fos and c-jun (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). c-Fos and c-Jun are members of the activator protein 1 (AP-1)1 family, which is one of several transcription factors that mediate diverse gene expression induced by UVC irradiation (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). AP-1 can also be induced by TPA, growth factors, cytokines, and transforming oncoproteins (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a protein complex that consists of families of Jun and Fos proteins. There are three Jun proteins (i.e. c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D) and four Fos proteins (i.e. c-Fos, Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2). Jun proteins form homodimers or heterodimers with Fos proteins; however, Fos proteins cannot homodimerize. AP-1 binds to a consensus site, known as the TPA response element (TRE), in the promoters of AP-1-induced genes and mediates transcriptional activation of these genes (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence supported a role for AP-1 in cell proliferation and tumor promotion. Its activity was enhanced when cells were stimulated by agents that promote proliferation (8Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). AP-1 was activated in tumor promotion-sensitive (P+) mouse JB6 epithelial cells, but not in tumor promotion-insensitive (P−) JB6 cells (9Bernstein L.R. Colburn N.H. Science. 1989; 244: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Blocking tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activity inhibited neoplastic transformation (10Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that blocking AP-1 transactivation in two malignant cell lines inhibited their ability to form squamous cell carcinomas upon subcutaneous injection into athymic nude mice (11Bowden G.T. Schneider B. Domann R. Kulesz-Martin M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1882s-1885sPubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that UVB irradiation leads to cell proliferation in vivo (12Epstein J.H. Fukuyama K. Fye K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 12: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The consequent effect of UVB-induced cell proliferation might lead to tumorigenesis (13Berton T.R. Fischer S.M. Conti C.J. Locniskar M.F. Nutr. Cancer. 1996; 26: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Huang et al. (14Huang C. Ma W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that UVB irradiation induced AP-1 transactivation in a mouse epithelial cell line. In light of the evidence of a functional role for AP-1 activation in epidermal carcinogenesis, AP-1 activation may also play an important role in UVB-induced tumor promotion. To date, most of the published research dealing with UV-induced signal transduction, as it relates to activation of AP-1, has involved the use of UVC irradiation. Since UVB is more relevant to sun-induced human skin cancers, and keratinocytes are a relevant cell type, this study deals with UVB and a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT (15Boukamp P. Petrusevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar). Although HaCaT is an immortalized cell line, these cells cannot induce tumors when injected into mice. Thus this cell line has been used extensively in different studies dealing with regulation of the AP-1 family members (16Isoherranen K. Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. Jansen C. Punnonen K. Cell.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether UVB irradiation induces AP-1 activation in HaCaT cells and to investigate the mechanisms involved in this induction. The following plasmids were used for transfection: AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (14Huang C. Ma W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), fos/luciferase plasmid (provided by Drs. Arai and Watanabe, University of Tokyo), pSV2-neo plasmid (20Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). The following probes were used for Northern blot analyses: a 2.2-kb EcoRI fragment of mouse c-foscDNA from plasmid pfos-ks. pFos-ks was generated by excising a 2.2-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment of mouse c-fos cDNA from plasmid pc-fos-3 (22Miller A.D. Curran T. Verma I.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) and inserting the 2.2-kb fragment into the multiple cloning site of pBluscript II KS(+/−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): a 0.75-kbPstI-XbaI fragment of human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA from plasmid PTZ-GAP (21Tso J.Y. Sun X.H. Kao T.H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), G418, Lipofectin, and LipofectAMINE were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Antibodies against AP-1 family members were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and luciferin were from Sigma. A human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT (15Boukamp P. Petrusevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3476) Google Scholar), was cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an incubator containing 5% CO2. Stably and transiently transfected cells were cultured under the same conditions. For experiments, the cells were cultured to 80% confluence, then serum-starved for 30–36 h. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to UVB without medium. A bank of two SF20 UVB lamps (National Biological Corp., Twinsburg, OH) with a peak emission at 313 nm were used. Control cells were mock-irradiated. After exposure to UVB, the cells were continually cultured in serum-free DMEM until the cells were harvested. Organotypic cultures were constructed as described previously (23Borchers A.H. Steinbauer H. Schafer B.S. Kramer M. Bowden G.T. Fusenig N.E. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using HaCaT cells stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid (described below). Organotypic cultures were constructed and cultured for 7 days at the air-liquid interface to allow for formation of a stratified epithelial layer. Cultures were then switched to serum-free medium for 36 h, UVB-irradiated, and then incubated for a further 20 h in serum-free DMEM. The transfected HaCaT layer was then peeled off from the underlying collagen gel with forceps and then processed for luciferase assays as described below. The HaCaT cells were cultured with DMEM in a 60-mm plate until they reached 50% confluence. For generating a stable transfectant containing a sequence from human collagenase-1 gene promoter (−73 to +63) with one endogenous AP-1 binding site driving a luciferase reporter gene, the cells were co-transfected in serum-free medium with 7.5 μg of AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.75 μg of pSV2-neo selection plasmid in the presence of 30 μl of Lipofectin reagent. 24 h later, medium was then replaced with DMEM containing serum. After 48 h the cells were subcultured into five 100-mm plates with G418 (800 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, and selected cells were cloned by ring cloning. For generating a stable transfectant containing a sequence from human c-fos promoter (−404 to +41, including serum response element) driving a luciferase reporter gene, the cells were co-transfected in serum-free DMEM with 3 μg of fos/luciferase plasmid and 0.3 μg of pSV2-neo plasmid in the presence of 6 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent for 15 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing serum. After 72 h the cells were subcultured into eight 100-mm plates with G418 (800 μg/ml) for 2 weeks, and selected cells were cloned by paper cloning. All the stable transfectants were screened by luciferase assays after the cells were treated with TPA (100 ng/ml) and/or UVB (400 or 250 J/m2). Isolation of cell nuclear protein was carried out as reported previously (24Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were performed with nuclear protein and [32P]dCTP-labeled double strand 22-mer probes containing the AP-1 binding site TGAGTCA (called TPA response element, TRE) (8Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar). Detailed procedures were as described previously (24Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody clearing assays were performed by preincubating nuclear protein with various concentrations of antibodies against AP-1 family members at 4 °C for 2 h. Then the [32P]dCTP-labeled 22-mer TRE probes were added to the reaction at room temperature, and gel shift assays were performed. Total cellular protein from transfected cells was extracted with lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured (26Barthelman M. Chen W. Gensler H.L. Huang C. Dong Z. Bowden G.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 711-716PubMed Google Scholar) using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytic Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD) or a Beckman LS 5000TD scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments Inc.). Total RNA was extracted, and Northern analyses were performed as described previously (27Holladay K. Fujiki H. Bowden G.T. Mol. Carcinog. 1992; 5: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Western analyses were carried out as reported previously (24Rosenberger S.F. Bowden G.T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2301-2308PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether UVB could induce AP-1 binding to its target DNA, gel shift assays were performed with nuclear proteins extracted from UVB-irradiated and unirradiated HaCaT cells using a radiolabeled double strand 22-mer probe containing a consensus AP-1 binding sequence. We first performed a UVB dose response study to ask which UVB dose could induce AP-1 DNA binding using gel shift assays. As shown in Fig. 1 A, an AP-1·DNA complex was found to exist in unirradiated cells. With increasing UVB dose, this basal AP-1 DNA binding activity was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. The elevated AP-1 DNA binding was detectable at 150 J/m2 and was further increased at 400 J/m2. We then carried out a time course study with an UVB dose of 250 J/m2. As shown in Fig. 1 B, AP-1 DNA binding was induced as early as 4 h after UVB irradiation with maximum induction occurring at 12 h. This binding gradually decreased to close to basal level within 20 h. The specificity of this complex was determined with competition assays using wild type and mutated TRE probes. The results indicated that the protein-DNA complexes were specific AP-1 protein-DNA complexes (data not shown). Since the same DNA element can be bound by various AP-1 proteins with different affinities (4Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar), we performed antibody clearing experiments to analyze the composition of the bound AP-1 complex(es). Prior to incubation with radiolabeled TRE probe, 4.5 μg of nuclear protein from UVB-irradiated cells were incubated with varying amounts of antibodies against different Jun and Fos proteins. Gel shift assays were then carried out. As shown in Fig. 2, we observed that with the lowest amount of antibodies (300 ng), c-Fos and Jun D antibodies caused significant reductions in AP-1 DNA binding. Furthermore, c-Fos antibody shifted the AP-1 complex to a more slowly migrating form, a “supershift.” These results suggested that c-Fos and Jun D were the main components of the complex. c-Jun, Jun B, Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2 appeared to be minor AP-1 members, since incubation with 300 ng of antibody did not significantly affect binding activity, whereas incubation with higher amounts of antibodies (600 and 900 ng) resulted in some band clearing. To examine the possible molecular mechanisms involved in UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding, we tested whether UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding was dependent on RNA and protein synthesis. We treated the HaCaT cells with the RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, or protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and asked whether these treatments could affect UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding. The results showed that both actinomycin D and cycloheximide significantly abrogated UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding (Fig. 3), which suggested that RNA and protein synthesis were required for UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding. Although we showed that UVB could induce AP-1 DNA binding (Fig. 1), this did not necessarily mean that AP-1 was activated. To test whether UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding could result in AP-1 transactivation, HaCaT cells were stably transfected with an AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid. This plasmid contained a 136-base pair fragment from the human collagenase-1 gene promoter (−73 to +63) with one endogenous AP-1 binding site driving a luciferase reporter gene. An UVB dose response study using the stable transfectant showed induction of reporter gene expression by UVB (Fig. 4 A). The pattern of UVB dose response for inducing AP-1 transactivation (Fig. 4 A) was very similar to that for inducing AP-1 DNA binding (Fig. 1 A). A time course further showed that peak induction occurred at about 24 h after 250 J/m2 UVB (Fig. 4 B). All of the above experiments were performed with HaCaT cells growing in monolayer on plastic. To investigate whether the results obtained from the monolayer cultures reflected what was happening in the epidermis, we carried out AP-1 transactivation experiments using the stably transfected HaCaT cells grown in an organotypic culture model (23Borchers A.H. Steinbauer H. Schafer B.S. Kramer M. Bowden G.T. Fusenig N.E. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 19: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This model system generates a epidermal skin equivalent by culturing air-exposed keratinocytes over a bed of collagen embedded with dermal fibroblasts. Similar to what is seen in normal skin, keratinocytes grown under these conditions form fully stratified epithelium. The stably transfected HaCaT cells were cultured over the collagen beds and UVB-irradiated. The results showed that UVB could induce AP-1 transactivation in the organotypic model (Fig. 4 C), which indicated relevance to skin. Since c-Fos and Jun D were the main components of UVB-induced AP-1·DNA binding complex, whereas other AP-1 members were minor components (Fig. 2), we tested whether UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding and AP-1 transactivation correlated with expression of these AP-1 proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, Western analyses indicated that UVB significantly increased c-Fos protein levels. However, other AP-1 members did not show significant changes after UVB irradiation. These results implied that UVB induced c-fos gene expression might be an important mechanism of UVB-induced AP-1 activation in HaCaT cells. To further determine the mechanism of increased c-Fos protein after UVB, we examined effect of UVB on c-fos mRNA level in HaCaT cells. As shown in Fig. 6, Northern analysis demonstrated that c-fos mRNA significantly increased after UVB, indicating that increased c-Fos protein might be the result of increased c-fos mRNA. The results of UVB increasing both c-fos mRNA and protein (Figs. 5 and 6) were consistent with the observation that RNA and protein syntheses were required for UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding (Fig. 3). To further determine the mechanism of increased c-fos mRNA after UVB, we stably transfected HaCaT cells with a fos/luciferase plasmid. This vector contains a fragment of the human c-fos promoter (−404 to +41, including serum response element) driving a luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase activity was examined with total cellular protein isolated from transfected cells after 250 J/m2 UVB treatment. The results showed a significantly increased luciferase activity with time after UVB (Fig. 7), supporting the idea that at least part of the increase in c-fos mRNA after UVB is due to transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene.Figure 7UVB induction of c-fostranscription in HaCaT cells. The cells were stably transfected with a fos/luciferase plasmid containing the human c-fos promoter (−404 to +41, including the serum response element) driving a luciferase reporter gene. The cells were serum-starved for 30 h and then exposed to 250 J/m2UVB. The cells were harvested at the time points as indicated after UVB, and cell lysates were prepared. c-fos transcription was measured by luciferase assay, which was presented as luciferase units/μg of protein. Each point represents the mean and S.E. of three samples. The results indicated that UVB increased c-fos gene transcription.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UVB is a major cause of human non-melanoma skin cancer (1Hall E.J.

It is well known that UVB acts both as a tumor initiator and tumor promoter (28Staberg B. Wolf H.C. Klemp P. Poulsen T. Bradhagen H. J. Invest.

In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that UVB increased AP-1 DNA binding to a TRE in cultured human keratinocytes (Fig. 1). More significantly, we demonstrated that this increased binding lead to AP-1 transactivation (Fig. 4). Both binding and transactivation were observed in dose-dependent manners (Figs. 1 A and 4 A). UVB-induced AP-1 transactivation was also detected in an organotypic skin model (Fig. 4 C), which may imply that sunlight might lead to similar biological alterations in human skin. It has been suggested that epidermal tumorigenesis is associated with a progressive increase of AP-1 activity (30Dong Z. Watts R.G. Sun Y. Zhan S.N. Colburn N.H. Int. J. Oncol. 1995; 7: 359-364PubMed Google Scholar), and constitutively elevated AP-1 activity might be required for maintenance of the malignant phenotype (31Domann F.E. Levy J.P. Birrer M.J. Bowden G.T. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar). Our results, taken together with other reports (8Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, 9Bernstein L.R. Colburn N.H. Science. 1989; 244: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Dong Z.

Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that AP-1 may be an important mediator of UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis. AP-1 can be regulated at two levels: activation of a pre-existing AP-1 complex through post-translational modification or synthesis of new AP-1 proteins (32Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Our results showed that RNA and protein synthesis were required for UVB-induced AP-1 DNA binding (Fig. 3). Two possibilities may be considered in this process: synthesis of the main components of UVB-induced AP-1 complex may be required or synthesis of some short-lived proteins that mediate UVB-induced post-translational modifications of pre-existing AP-1. Using antibody clearing assays we found UVB-induced AP-1 complexes consisted predominantly of c-Fos and Jun D proteins (Fig. 2) in HaCaT cells. This result is similar to a recent report, which suggested that Jun D might be the predominant heterodimer partner for c-Fos in normal human skin (33Fisher G.J. Talwar H.S. Lin J. Lin P. McPhillips F. Wang Z. Li X. Wan Y. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our Western analyses showed that of all AP-1 family members only c-Fos protein was significantly increased after UVB (Fig. 5). The results of our northern analyses further showed that steady state level of c-fosmRNA was significantly increased with the time after UVB (Fig. 6), which suggested a possible reason of UVB-increased c-Fos protein. The observation that requirement for transcription and translation (Fig. 3) correlated with increases in steady state levels of c-fosmRNA and protein (Figs. 5 and 6) indicates that UVB-increased AP-1 activation, including AP-1 DNA binding and AP-1 transactivation, may be primarily due to increased c-fos gene expression. Induction of c-fos transcription by UVC was observed in primary human skin fibroblasts (34Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Schreiber et al. (35Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported that c-Fos was an essential component of the mammalian UVC response. They observed that transcriptional induction of the AP-1 target genes by UVC was almost absent in cells lacking c-fos gene, which correlated with a reduced UVC induction of AP-1 DNA binding and transactivation (35Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5338-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Our findings indicated that increased c-fos expression may play an important role in UVB-induced AP-1 activation in HaCaT cells. Although UVB irradiation leads to significantly increased c-fos mRNA (Fig. 5), it was not clear whether this increased message was due to transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene or stabilization of c-fos mRNA. To begin to answer this question, we transfected the cells with a plasmid containing a fragment of the human c-fos promoter driving a luciferase reporter gene and analyzed luciferase activity from cell extracts after UVB. Our results showed that UVB significantly stimulated c-fos gene transcription (Fig. 7). Thus, transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene was, at least in part, responsible for the increased c-fos mRNA and protein after UVB. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that c-fos mRNA stabilization could play a role as well. Similar results to ours have been reported in mouse epidermal cells (36Shah G. Ghosh R. Amstad P.A. Cerutti P.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 38-45PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to other studies, which reported a fast and transient induction of c-fos gene (37Buscher M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Litfin M. Karin M. Herrlich H. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 301-311PubMed Google Scholar, 38Treisman R. Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), we observed in our system that c-fos mRNA and protein levels were increased later and stayed elevated for more than 12 h (Figs. 5 and 6). This difference could be explained by the fact that different cell lines (fibroblasts) and different extracellular stimulators (serum, UVC) were used. This observation was supported by Shah et al. (36Shah G. Ghosh R. Amstad P.A. Cerutti P.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 38-45PubMed Google Scholar) who reported similar results to ours using UVB and a mouse epithelial cell line. They observed that UVB induced an immediate early response of c-fos that was down-regulated within 2 h and a strong second phase of c-fos induction, which peaked at 8 h and returned to basal level after 24 h. They suggested that UVB-irradiated cells may release a factor with the ability to induce the second phase of c-fos induction. In addition, continuous expression of the c-fos gene has been reported in normal human skin under physiological conditions (33Fisher G.J. Talwar H.S. Lin J. Lin P. McPhillips F. Wang Z. Li X. Wan Y. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1432-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 39Basset-Seguin N. Escot C. Blanchard J. Kerai C. Verrier B. Mion H. Guilhou J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 418-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of UVB-induced c-fos expression may be similar to that of serum (38Treisman R. Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 40Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Serum-induced c-fostranscription is through the serum response element, which is located in the promoter region of the c-fos gene (40Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 41Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the ternary complex factor (TCF), a transcription factor that binds to the SRE, is critical for triggering c-fos transcription by serum (41Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which includes ERK, JNK, and p38, plays an important role in activating TCF (41Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2310) Google Scholar, 43Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). ERK can activate TCF through phosphorylating the protein at serine 383 and serine 389 (41Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 43Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5057-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The activated TCF then induces c-fos transcription (41Janknecht R. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that both JNK and p38, which are activated by UVC irradiation, are also able to phosphorylate the same major sites in TCF recognized by ERK and activate the TCF (44Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 45Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that all three members of the MAPK family may participate in triggering transcription of the c-fos gene. Huang et al. (46Huang C. Ma W. Dong Z. Proceedings of 88th Annual Meeting of American Association for Cancer Research, April 12–16, San Diego, CA. 38. American Association for Cancer Research, San Diego, CA1997: 64Google Scholar) have reported that ERK was activated in UVB-irradiated mouse epithelial cells. Assefa et al. (47Assefa Z. Garmyn M. Bouillon R. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Agostinis P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 108: 886-891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have shown that UVB caused differential stimulation of ERK and JNK activities in HaCaT cells. Our preliminary data indicated that UVB irradiation resulted in activation of JNK, ERK, and p38 kinases in HaCaT cells. Based on these results we speculate that alterations of activities of MAPK family members might be a possible mechanism through which UVB induces c-fos expression. It has been demonstrated that the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) family was involved in UVB-induced AP-1 activation by using both Xenopus PKCλ and mouse PKCζ dominant negative mutant constructs (14Huang C. Ma W. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It appears that MAPK are downstream of aPKC, since PKCζ has been found to bind to Ras, which is located upstream of MAPK (25Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Mascat J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Google Scholar). Thus it is possible that aPKC-MAPK pathway might be involved in UVB-induced c-fos expression. Experiments in progress are directed at exploring this possibility. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that in HaCaT cells UVB irradiation can induce significant AP-1 DNA binding and AP-1 transactivation. Accumulation of c-fos mRNA and protein may be the main mechanism of UVB-induced AP-1 activation. Increased c-fos expression may be explained by UVB-induced transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene.

In this study, we report the purification of a heme-sensitive eIF2α kinase activity from both mouse liver and NIH 3T3 cell extracts. Furthermore, we have cloned and characterized this mouse liver eIF2α kinase (mHRI), which exhibits 83 and 94% identities to rabbit and rat HRIs, respectively. Both the purified enzyme and recombinant mHRI exhibited an autokinase and an eIF2α kinase activity, and both activities were inhibitedin vitro by hemin. In addition, wild-type mHRI, but not the inactive mHRI-K196R mutant, was autophosphorylated in vivowhen it was expressed in 293 cells. Quantitation of mHRI mRNA expression in various mouse tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed relatively high levels in liver, kidney, and testis. These results provide strong evidence that mHRI is a ubiquitous eIF2α kinase of mammalian cells, suggesting that it could play important roles in the translational regulation of nonerythroid tissues.

Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α)1 is one of the best characterized mechanisms for down-regulating protein synthesis in mammalian cells in response to various stress conditions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Jackson R.J.

The absence of hemin results in the activation of a highly specific eIF2α kinase called the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes.

Another mammalian eIF2α kinase, the double-stranded RNA-activated kinase PKR, is constitutively expressed in reticulocytes and inducible by interferon in other mammalian cells (6Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). At present, only these two distinct mammalian eIF2α kinases have been cloned (5Chen J.J. London I.M.

Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2260) Google Scholar) and phosphorylate eIF2α at serine 51. This phosphorylation mediates translational control by reducing the levels of functional eIF2B, which is required for the exchange of GTP for GDP in the recycling of eIF2 (1Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar, 10Clemens M.J. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although phosphorylation of eIF2α was believed to nonspecifically down-regulate translation initiation, recent results have indicated that it can up-regulate the synthesis of specific proteins (4Wek R.C.

Thus, eIF2α phosphorylation enhances the translation of yeast GCN4, a transcriptional activator of genes involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids (4Wek R.C. Trends Biochem.

They mostly concerned PKR, but the significant homology of HRI to three yeast protein kinases implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle (13Chen J.J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10201-10204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing 82% amino acid identity. Both rabbit and rat HRIs contain two heme regulatory motifs located within the catalytic domain and not found in either PKR or GCN2 (5Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem.

Although a role for HRI has been clearly defined in reticulocytes, the tissue specificity of HRI expression remains uncertain (11de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). To date, little is known about eIF2α kinases in nonerythroid cells other than PKR, and as Chen and London (5Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) noted, a hemin-sensitive eIF2α kinase activity has not been well characterized in nonerythroid tissues. In fact, it has been proposed that neither the HRI mRNA nor the HRI protein is expressed in nonerythroid cells (16Crosby J.S. Lee K. London I.M. Chen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3906-3914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Pal J.K. Chen J.J. London I.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2555-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although, Mellor et al. (15Mellor H. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10201-10204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have found the HRI mRNA in a wide range of nonerythroid rat tissues, it remains to be determined whether there are HRI-like enzymes in nonerythroid cells.In this paper, we report an eIF2α kinase activity that has been purified from either mouse liver or NIH 3T3 cell extracts and that has shown the same sensitivity to hemin treatment as did HRI purified from rabbit reticulocytes. In addition, we report the cloning of mouse liver HRI (mHRI) and, subsequently, the finding that the corresponding mRNA is present in several nonerythroid tissues and in NIH 3T3 cells. Also, we present evidence that mHRI is active as an autokinase and as an eIF2α kinase and that both activities are responsive to hemin in vitro. When expressed in 293 cells, wild-type mHRI, but not the inactive mHRI-K196R mutant, is autophosphorylatedin vivo. This study provides evidence for the first time that HRI is expressed as an active protein kinase in nonerythroid mammalian cells and opens the possibility of broader participation of this eIF2α kinase in translational control.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have partially purified an eIF2α kinase (mHRI) activity from either mouse liver or NIH 3T3 cell extracts. It is especially important to note that this novel eIF2α kinase activity is responsive to hemin, in marked contrast to PKR and GCN2. Although HRI was previously cloned from rat brain (15Mellor H. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10201-10204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and it was demonstrated that the rat HRI mRNA is expressed in a wide variety of nonerythroid tissues, until now, there was no evidence of HRI activity in such tissues. In fact, it has been suggested that HRI may be an erythroid-specific enzyme (5Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Our findings lead to the notion that an HRI activity exists in nonerythroid tissues and cell cultures and raise the possibility of additional roles for this enzyme in translational regulation. We have cloned the cDNA encoding this mouse liver eIF2α kinase homologue of rabbit reticulocyte HRI. We show here that the expression of wild-type mHRI in a prokaryotic system yields a protein with characteristics indistinguishable from those of mHRI purified from mouse liver extracts. Thus, purified and recombinant mHRIs are specifically recognized by anti-mHRI antibodies and exhibit both autokinase and eIF2α kinase activities that are inhibited by heme in vitro. Similar results have been previously obtained with recombinant reticulocyte HRI expressed in insect cells (27Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not with recombinant rat HRI expressed in a prokaryotic system, where no autophosphorylating activity was detected (5Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).There is evidence that autophosphorylation is required for the activation of PKR (28Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that wild-type PKR, but not the inactive PKR-K296R mutant, undergoes autophosphorylation when expressed in yeast cells (25Dever T.E. Sripriya R. McLachlin J.R. Lu J. Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, recombinant mHRI specifically phosphorylates eIF2α in vitro at Ser-51, and moreover, wild-type mHRI, but not the inactive mHRI-K196R mutant, expressed in 293 cells, has shown an autophosphorylating activity in vivo. It has recently been shown that Thr-446 and Thr-551 in the PKR activation loop are some autophosphorylation sites in vivo (26Romano P.R. Garcı́a-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is of interest that mHRI contains two Thr residues (Thr-485 and Thr-490) at exactly the same positions relative to subdomain VIII as those occupied by Thr-446 and Thr-551 in PKR. In summary, we have cloned and purified a mouse eIF2α kinase from nonerythroid cells, showing all the properties that are characteristic of reticulocyte HRI.We have provided evidence that the mRNA encoding this enzyme is expressed in all mouse tissues examined as well as in NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, consistent with the Northern analysis (data not shown), the quantitative RT-PCR assays (applied to total unfractionated RNA) revealed a broad range of expression levels of mHRI mRNA in every tissue investigated. Thus, we have found a strong expression in liver, kidney, and testis and at least 3 orders of magnitude less in skeletal muscle. The general abundance of mHRI mRNA in mouse nonerythroid tissues, together with the presence of a heme-sensitive eIF2α kinase activity in both liver and NIH 3T3 cell extracts, may indicate that HRI plays additional roles in mammalian cells. It will now be important to establish alternative mechanisms of regulation of HRI in cells that do not produce significant levels of hemin. In this respect, we have isolated and partially purified, from mouse liver post-mitochondrial supernatants, an eIF2α kinase inhibitor that could be involved in the translational control of mammalian liver. 2S. Herrero, J. J. Berlanga, and C. de Haro, unpublished results. Collectively, our results indicate that mHRI is an eIF2α kinase that occurs in nonerythroid cells. The main physiological function of HRI in erythroid cells appears to be the balanced synthesis of globin chains and heme, whereas the physiological significance of the expression of HRI in nonerythroid cell types remains to be clarified. Control of the activity of eIF2α-specific kinases occurs in response to stimulation of cell proliferation by mitogens and growth factors as well as to induction of cell differentiation (11de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that PKR may function as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (29Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 30Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, more recently, Yang et al. (31Yang Y.L. Reis L.F.L. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schäffer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R.G. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) reported that mice devoid of functional PKR develop normally, suggesting that this enzyme does not play an essential role in growth control, either because this is not its function or because it is redundant in this regard. The presence of another eIF2α kinase in mouse cells, reported here, could explain such results by assuming that mHRI can replace PKR functionally in PKR knockout mice. Thus, our finding that mHRI undergoes autophosphorylation when expressed in mammalian cells strongly suggests that HRI, like PKR, is an ubiquitous mammalian eIF2α kinase and raises the possibility that these enzyme may also play a role in the growth and differentiation of nonerythroid cells. Phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α)1 is one of the best characterized mechanisms for down-regulating protein synthesis in mammalian cells in response to various stress conditions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Jackson R.J.

DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have partially purified an eIF2α kinase (mHRI) activity from either mouse liver or NIH 3T3 cell extracts. It is especially important to note that this novel eIF2α kinase activity is responsive to hemin, in marked contrast to PKR and GCN2. Although HRI was previously cloned from rat brain (15Mellor H. Flowers K.M. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10201-10204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and it was demonstrated that the rat HRI mRNA is expressed in a wide variety of nonerythroid tissues, until now, there was no evidence of HRI activity in such tissues. In fact, it has been suggested that HRI may be an erythroid-specific enzyme (5Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Our findings lead to the notion that an HRI activity exists in nonerythroid tissues and cell cultures and raise the possibility of additional roles for this enzyme in translational regulation. We have cloned the cDNA encoding this mouse liver eIF2α kinase homologue of rabbit reticulocyte HRI. We show here that the expression of wild-type mHRI in a prokaryotic system yields a protein with characteristics indistinguishable from those of mHRI purified from mouse liver extracts. Thus, purified and recombinant mHRIs are specifically recognized by anti-mHRI antibodies and exhibit both autokinase and eIF2α kinase activities that are inhibited by heme in vitro. Similar results have been previously obtained with recombinant reticulocyte HRI expressed in insect cells (27Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not with recombinant rat HRI expressed in a prokaryotic system, where no autophosphorylating activity was detected (5Chen J.J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).There is evidence that autophosphorylation is required for the activation of PKR (28Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1576-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and that wild-type PKR, but not the inactive PKR-K296R mutant, undergoes autophosphorylation when expressed in yeast cells (25Dever T.E. Sripriya R. McLachlin J.R. Lu J. Fabian J.R. Kimball S.R. Miller L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4164-4169Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Accordingly, recombinant mHRI specifically phosphorylates eIF2α in vitro at Ser-51, and moreover, wild-type mHRI, but not the inactive mHRI-K196R mutant, expressed in 293 cells, has shown an autophosphorylating activity in vivo. It has recently been shown that Thr-446 and Thr-551 in the PKR activation loop are some autophosphorylation sites in vivo (26Romano P.R. Garcı́a-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is of interest that mHRI contains two Thr residues (Thr-485 and Thr-490) at exactly the same positions relative to subdomain VIII as those occupied by Thr-446 and Thr-551 in PKR. In summary, we have cloned and purified a mouse eIF2α kinase from nonerythroid cells, showing all the properties that are characteristic of reticulocyte HRI.We have provided evidence that the mRNA encoding this enzyme is expressed in all mouse tissues examined as well as in NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, consistent with the Northern analysis (data not shown), the quantitative RT-PCR assays (applied to total unfractionated RNA) revealed a broad range of expression levels of mHRI mRNA in every tissue investigated. Thus, we have found a strong expression in liver, kidney, and testis and at least 3 orders of magnitude less in skeletal muscle. The general abundance of mHRI mRNA in mouse nonerythroid tissues, together with the presence of a heme-sensitive eIF2α kinase activity in both liver and NIH 3T3 cell extracts, may indicate that HRI plays additional roles in mammalian cells. It will now be important to establish alternative mechanisms of regulation of HRI in cells that do not produce significant levels of hemin. In this respect, we have isolated and partially purified, from mouse liver post-mitochondrial supernatants, an eIF2α kinase inhibitor that could be involved in the translational control of mammalian liver. 2S. Herrero, J. J. Berlanga, and C. de Haro, unpublished results. Collectively, our results indicate that mHRI is an eIF2α kinase that occurs in nonerythroid cells. The main physiological function of HRI in erythroid cells appears to be the balanced synthesis of globin chains and heme, whereas the physiological significance of the expression of HRI in nonerythroid cell types remains to be clarified. Control of the activity of eIF2α-specific kinases occurs in response to stimulation of cell proliferation by mitogens and growth factors as well as to induction of cell differentiation (11de Haro C. Méndez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 12Clemens M.J. Hershey J.W. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that PKR may function as a suppressor of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (29Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 30Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) reported that mice devoid of functional PKR develop normally, suggesting that this enzyme does not play an essential role in growth control, either because this is not its function or because it is redundant in this regard. The presence of another eIF2α kinase in mouse cells, reported here, could explain such results by assuming that mHRI can replace PKR functionally in PKR knockout mice. Thus, our finding that mHRI undergoes autophosphorylation when expressed in mammalian cells strongly suggests that HRI, like PKR, is an ubiquitous mammalian eIF2α kinase and raises the possibility that these enzyme may also play a role in the growth and differentiation of nonerythroid cells.

It has been proposed that rodent group IIa PLA2 is anchored to cell surfaces via attachment to heparan sulfate proteoglycan and that this interaction facilitates lipolysis. hIIa-PLA2 contains 13 lysines, 2 histidines, and 10 arginines that fall into 10 clusters. A panel of 26 hIIa-PLA2 mutants were prepared in which 1–4 basic residues in each cluster were changed to glutamate or aspartate (charge reversal). A detailed analysis of the affinities of these mutants for anionic vesicles and for heparin and heparan sulfate in vitro and of the specific activities of these proteins for hydrolysis of vesiclesin vitro and of living cell membranes reveal the following trends: 1) the affinity of hIIa-PLA2 for heparin and heparan sulfate is modulated not by a highly localized site of basic residues but by diffuse sites that partially overlap with the interfacial binding site. In contrast, only those residues on the interfacial binding site of hIIa-PLA2 are involved in binding to membranes; 2) the relative ability of these mutants to hydrolyze cellular phospholipids when enzymes were added exogenously to CHO-K1, NIH-3T3, and RAW 264.7 cells correlates with their relative in vitro affinity for vesicles and not with their affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate. 3) The rates of exogenous hIIa-PLA2-catalyzed fatty acid release from wild type CHO-K1 cells and two mutant lines, one lacking glycosaminoglycan and one lacking heparan sulfate, were similar. Thus basic residues that modulate interfacial binding are important for plasma membrane fatty acid release by exogenously added hIIa-PLA2.

Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One of the main questions in the field is to understand the molecular features of PLA2s that control their binding to target cell membranes.Detailed kinetic and structural studies have shown that secreted PLA2s contain functionally and topographically distinct interfacial binding and active site surfaces (2Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Hanel A.M. Berg O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Mailer C. Hubbell W.L. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H.

Berg O.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 567-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The interfacial binding surface, which allows a desolvated contact of the enzyme with membranes (17Jain M.K. Vaz W.L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) consists of residues that surround the opening of a deep active site slot (Fig. 1). A substrate molecule must leave the membrane plane to travel about 15 Å into the active site slot to reach the catalytic residues (18Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, secreted PLA2s bind several orders of magnitude tighter to vesicles of anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylmethanol and phosphatidylserine) than to vesicles of charge-neutral phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine) (19Jain M.K. Ranadive G., Yu, B.-Z. Verheij H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7330-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and this differential binding is very pronounced for hIIa-PLA2 (20Bayburt T., Yu, B.Z. Lin H.K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Dua R. Cho W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is due in part to the presence of basic amino acids on the putative interfacial binding surface of hIIa-PLA2 as shown by recent directed mutagenesis studies in which lysines and arginines were changed to glutamates (charge reversal) (22Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 26: 14325-14333Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A more detailed discussion of the molecular elements of interfacial binding of secreted PLA2s including the important role of hydrophobic residues has been presented (23Ghomashchi F. Lin F., Yu, B.-Z. Annand R.A. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6697-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Han S.K. Yoon E.T. Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3573-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Group IIa PLA2 from several species also binds to the anionic sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate (referred to below as heparinoids), and high salt elution of enzyme from heparin-Sepharose provides a key step for the purification of this enzyme (21Dua R. Cho W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Mizushima H. Kudo I. Horigome K. Murakami M. Hayakawa M. Kim D.-K. Kondo E. Tomita M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that group IIa PLA2is tethered to cell surfaces by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and that this binding is important for the hydrolysis of cell phospholipids. Rat liver-derived BRL-3A cells secrete group IIa PLA2, and appreciable amounts of this enzyme are found in the extracellular medium only when free heparin, heparan sulfate, or dextran sulfate are added to the culture medium (26Suga H. Murakami M. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the observation that group IIa PLA2 binds to these anionic polymers. Treatment of the cells with heparitinases results in a reduction of prostaglandin production, which suggests that binding of group IIa PLA2to cell surface proteoglycan augments arachidonic acid release (26Suga H. Murakami M. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for prostaglandin production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (11Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 839-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for degranulation of mast cells induced by exogenous rodent group IIa PLA2 (27Murakami M. Hara N. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5675-5684PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface anchoring of group IIa PLA2 to heparan sulfate proteoglycan is not without precedence. It has been well established that proteins such as fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III are anchored to cell surfaces by binding to proteoglycan (28Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the surface of capillary endothelial cells where it acts on lipid esters present in circulating chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (28Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Additionally, cellular uptake of lipoproteins is thought to be facilitated by their capture by cell-surface bound lipoprotein lipase (28Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous heparin results in release of the lipase from cell surfaces so that it now binds to circulating lipoproteins in plasma.One possible model is that group IIa PLA2 is bound simultaneously to cell surface proteoglycan via a putative heparin-binding site and to membranes via its interfacial binding site. There are reasons to propose that group IIa PLA2 contains such distinct binding sites. Two monoclonal antibodies have been described that prevent binding of rat group IIa PLA2 to heparin-Sepharose but do not inhibit the lipolytic activity of this enzyme on phospholipid vesicles (29Murakami M. Kobayashi T. Umeda M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic studies of the effect of heparin on porcine pancreatic PLA2 catalyzed vesicle hydrolysis show that heparin can bind to the enzyme without displacing it from anionic vesicles (30Yu B.-Z. Rogers J. Ranadive G. Baker S. Wilton D.C. Apitz-Castro R. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12400-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have shown that hIIa-PLA2 bound to heparin-Sepharose is able to bind inhibitors in its active site while the tethered enzyme remains bound to micelles of hexadecylphosphatidylcholine. 2M. D. Bryant and M. H. Gelb, unpublished observations. 2M. D. Bryant and M. H. Gelb, unpublished observations.hIIa-PLA2 is a highly basic protein that contains 13 lysines and 10 arginines scattered over its surface, and presumably some of these are involved in binding to sulfated glycosaminoglycans. In the present study, we have mutated many of the surface cationic residues to anionic glutamates or aspartates. The in vitro binding of these mutants to anionic phospholipid vesicles and to heparin and heparan sulfate was studied. In addition, the rate of fatty acid release from three different mammalian cells treated exogenously with mutant hIIa-PLA2s was quantified. The results show that in vitrovesicle binding affinity rather than heparinoid binding affinity is a main determinant for controlling the rate of fatty acid release from intact cells treated exogenously with hIIa-PLA2. The data is discussed in terms of previous elegant studies of rodent group IIa PLA2-heparinoid binding including recent mutagenesis analysis of the mouse enzyme (31Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J.

The phospholipase A2(PLA2)1 family of enzymes hydrolyze the sn-2 ester of glycerophospholipids to produce a fatty acid and a lysophospholipid (1Dennis E.A. J. Biol.

The human group IIa secreted PLA2 (hIIa-PLA2) is secreted from a number of activated cells including platelets (6Kramer R.M. Hession C. Johansen B. Hayes G. McGray P. Chow E.P. Tizard R.

Extensive studies have shown that hIIa-PLA2 is pro-inflammatory when injected into animals (9Wong P.Y.-K. Dennis E.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 275: 1990Google Scholar, 10Pruzanski W. Vadas P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One of the main questions in the field is to understand the molecular features of PLA2s that control their binding to target cell membranes. Detailed kinetic and structural studies have shown that secreted PLA2s contain functionally and topographically distinct interfacial binding and active site surfaces (2Gelb M.H. Jain M.K. Hanel A.M. Berg O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Lin Y. Nielsen R. Murray D. Mailer C. Hubbell W.L. Robinson B.H. Gelb M.H.

Berg O.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 567-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The interfacial binding surface, which allows a desolvated contact of the enzyme with membranes (17Jain M.K. Vaz W.L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 905: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) consists of residues that surround the opening of a deep active site slot (Fig. 1). A substrate molecule must leave the membrane plane to travel about 15 Å into the active site slot to reach the catalytic residues (18Scott D.L. White S.P. Otwinowski Z. Yuan W. Gelb M.H. Sigler P.B. Science. 1990; 250: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Most, if not all, secreted PLA2s bind several orders of magnitude tighter to vesicles of anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylmethanol and phosphatidylserine) than to vesicles of charge-neutral phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine) (19Jain M.K. Ranadive G., Yu, B.-Z. Verheij H.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7330-7340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and this differential binding is very pronounced for hIIa-PLA2 (20Bayburt T., Yu, B.Z. Lin H.K. Browning J. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Dua R. Cho W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This is due in part to the presence of basic amino acids on the putative interfacial binding surface of hIIa-PLA2 as shown by recent directed mutagenesis studies in which lysines and arginines were changed to glutamates (charge reversal) (22Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 26: 14325-14333Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A more detailed discussion of the molecular elements of interfacial binding of secreted PLA2s including the important role of hydrophobic residues has been presented (23Ghomashchi F. Lin F., Yu, B.-Z. Annand R.A. Jain M.K. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6697-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Han S.K. Yoon E.T. Scott D.L. Sigler P.B. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3573-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Group IIa PLA2 from several species also binds to the anionic sulfated glycosaminoglycans heparin and heparan sulfate (referred to below as heparinoids), and high salt elution of enzyme from heparin-Sepharose provides a key step for the purification of this enzyme (21Dua R. Cho W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Mizushima H. Kudo I. Horigome K. Murakami M. Hayakawa M. Kim D.-K. Kondo E. Tomita M. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that group IIa PLA2is tethered to cell surfaces by binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and that this binding is important for the hydrolysis of cell phospholipids. Rat liver-derived BRL-3A cells secrete group IIa PLA2, and appreciable amounts of this enzyme are found in the extracellular medium only when free heparin, heparan sulfate, or dextran sulfate are added to the culture medium (26Suga H. Murakami M. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the observation that group IIa PLA2 binds to these anionic polymers. Treatment of the cells with heparitinases results in a reduction of prostaglandin production, which suggests that binding of group IIa PLA2to cell surface proteoglycan augments arachidonic acid release (26Suga H. Murakami M. Inoue K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for prostaglandin production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (11Murakami M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 839-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for degranulation of mast cells induced by exogenous rodent group IIa PLA2 (27Murakami M. Hara N. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5675-5684PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface anchoring of group IIa PLA2 to heparan sulfate proteoglycan is not without precedence. It has been well established that proteins such as fibroblast growth factor and antithrombin III are anchored to cell surfaces by binding to proteoglycan (28Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Lipoprotein lipase is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the surface of capillary endothelial cells where it acts on lipid esters present in circulating chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (28Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Additionally, cellular uptake of lipoproteins is thought to be facilitated by their capture by cell-surface bound lipoprotein lipase (28Conrad H.E. Heparin-binding Proteins. Academic Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Addition of exogenous heparin results in release of the lipase from cell surfaces so that it now binds to circulating lipoproteins in plasma. One possible model is that group IIa PLA2 is bound simultaneously to cell surface proteoglycan via a putative heparin-binding site and to membranes via its interfacial binding site. There are reasons to propose that group IIa PLA2 contains such distinct binding sites. Two monoclonal antibodies have been described that prevent binding of rat group IIa PLA2 to heparin-Sepharose but do not inhibit the lipolytic activity of this enzyme on phospholipid vesicles (29Murakami M. Kobayashi T. Umeda M. Kudo I. Inoue K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Detailed kinetic studies of the effect of heparin on porcine pancreatic PLA2 catalyzed vesicle hydrolysis show that heparin can bind to the enzyme without displacing it from anionic vesicles (30Yu B.-Z. Rogers J. Ranadive G. Baker S. Wilton D.C. Apitz-Castro R. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12400-12411Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have shown that hIIa-PLA2 bound to heparin-Sepharose is able to bind inhibitors in its active site while the tethered enzyme remains bound to micelles of hexadecylphosphatidylcholine. 2M. D. Bryant and M. H. Gelb, unpublished observations. 2M. D. Bryant and M. H. Gelb, unpublished observations. hIIa-PLA2 is a highly basic protein that contains 13 lysines and 10 arginines scattered over its surface, and presumably some of these are involved in binding to sulfated glycosaminoglycans. In the present study, we have mutated many of the surface cationic residues to anionic glutamates or aspartates. The in vitro binding of these mutants to anionic phospholipid vesicles and to heparin and heparan sulfate was studied. In addition, the rate of fatty acid release from three different mammalian cells treated exogenously with mutant hIIa-PLA2s was quantified. The results show that in vitrovesicle binding affinity rather than heparinoid binding affinity is a main determinant for controlling the rate of fatty acid release from intact cells treated exogenously with hIIa-PLA2. The data is discussed in terms of previous elegant studies of rodent group IIa PLA2-heparinoid binding including recent mutagenesis analysis of the mouse enzyme (31Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Kudo I. J.

In the human colon carcinoma cell line SW-480, we detected a mitogenic effect of bradykinin (BK) that is mediated via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein of the Gq/11 family and that involves activation of MAPK. Both BK-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis and activation of MAPK in response to BK were abolished by two different inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and LY 294002, as well as by two different inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), bisindolylmaleimide and Ro 31-8220. Stimulation of SW-480 cells by BK led to increased formation of PI3K lipid products (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate) and to enhanced translocation of the PKCε isoform from the cytosol to the membrane. Both effects of BK were inhibited by wortmannin, too. Using subtype-specific antibodies, only the PI3K subunits p110β and p85, but not p110α and p110γ, were detected in SW-480 cells. Finally, p110β was found to be co-immunoprecipitated with PKCε. Our data suggest that in SW-480 cells, (i) dimeric PI3Kβ is activated via a Gq/11 protein; (ii) PKCε is a downstream target of PI3Kβ mediating the mitogenic signal to the MAPK pathway; and (iii) PKCε associates with the p110 subunit of PI3Kβ.

G protein-coupled receptors mediate effects of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters on intermediary metabolism as well as play an important role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. Similar to receptor tyrosine kinases, they initiate signaling pathways that finally activate members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 family. One MAPK subfamily, which includes the extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1 and Erk2, is stimulated via a consecutive activation of the protein kinases Raf and MEK. The MAPK cascade is initially switched on via activation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding protein Ras. GTP-bound Ras associates the proximal kinase Raf to the plasma membrane, resulting in its activation. Several signal transduction pathways from G protein-coupled receptors to MAPK have been proposed that may be classified according to the type of G protein involved (for review, see Refs. 1van Biesen T. Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Endoc. Rev. 1996; 17: 698-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar and 2Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Thus, MAPK activation via pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Giprotein-coupled receptor, such as the m2 muscarinic receptor, was found to be mediated by Gβγ subunits, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ), and Ras (3Lopez-Illasaca M. Crespo P. Pellici P.G. Gutkind J.S. Wetzker R. Science. 1997; 275: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In contrast, receptors coupled to G proteins of the PTX-insensitive Gq/11 family, such as the m1 muscarinic receptor, mediate MAPK activation via a Gα subunit that is Ras-independent and may involve PKC (4Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Once activated, the different PKC isoforms, with the exception of PKCζ, activate the MAPK cascade at the level of Raf (5Schönwasser D.C. Marais R.M. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), but may also involve tyrosine kinases of the Src family (6Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X.-Y. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). MAPK activation by PTX-sensitive Go proteins appears to be independent of Gβγ and Ras, but requires PKC (8van Biesen T.

Gs-coupled receptors such as the β-adrenergic receptor were found to exert a dual effect on MAPK involving Gβγ-mediated activation and cAMP-mediated inhibition (9Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Ullrich and co-workers (10Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C.

They propose an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptors as the key event, which might be mediated by cytosolic tyrosine kinases such as Src and PYK2. In addition to receptor tyrosine kinases and PKC, PI3Ks appear to be key signaling enzymes implicated in the regulation of receptor-stimulated mitogenesis. After activation, they preferentially utilize phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate as substrate, which is phosphorylated to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), followed by rapid degradation to PtdIns(3,4)P2. Both molecules have been proposed to act as second messengers. Recent studies indicate that both PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 can directly activate certain PKC isoforms and the serine/threonine-protein kinase Akt/PKB (for review, see Refs. 13Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar and 14Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). In terms of mode of regulation, class I members are subdivided into receptor tyrosine kinase-associated (class IA) or G protein-coupled receptor-activated (class IB) PI3Ks (for review, see Ref.15Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The class IA types have been structurally characterized as a heterodimer consisting of a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) and an 85-kDa regulatory subunit (p85). They are stimulated through receptors with intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinase activity that bind to the p85 subunit, thereby inducing PI3K activity. The only known class IB member (termed PI3Kγ) consists of a p110 catalytic subunit that lacks the binding site for p85, but is associated with a p101 non-catalytic subunit (16Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage M. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader T. Tempot P. Hawkins P.T.

Gα subunits of Gi (but not Gq or G12) proteins only moderately activate p110γ (17Leopold D. Hanck T. Exner T. Maier U. Wetzker R. Nürnberg B. J. Biol.

The functional discrimination of class IAand IB members was questioned very recently since, in vitro, PI3Kβ has been shown to respond synergistically to both Gβγ and a synthetic phosphotyrosyl peptide that binds to the SH2 domain of p85 (19Kurosu H.

The cells were incubated for another 24 h, followed by the addition of [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml, 2 μm) for 12 h. Finally, cells were filtered through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters using a Brandel harvester and washed three times with 5 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The filters were dried, and the cells were counted for incorporated radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The bradykinin receptor binding assay was performed as described previously (23Liebmann C. Graneß A. Ludwig B. Adomeit A. Boehmer A. Boehmer F.-D. Nürnberg B. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with some modifications. SW-480 membranes (∼400 μg of protein/tube) were incubated with [3H]BK (0.6–0.8 nm) in 1 ml of a medium containing 25 mm TES, pH 6.8, 1 mm1,10-phenanthroline, 140 μg/ml bacitracin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm captopril, and 0.1% BSA. After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min (equilibrium conditions), the samples were quickly filtered through Whatman GF/B glass-fiber filters pretreated with 0.1% aqueous polyethyleneimine using a Brandel harvester. The filters were washed with 3 × 5 ml of ice-cold 10 mm TES, pH 6.8; dried; and counted for radioactivity (Quickszint 501, Zinsser, Frankfurt, Germany). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled bradykinin. Specific binding of [3H]BK was in the range 40–60%. Determination of total inositol phosphates was performed as described previously (23Liebmann C. Graneß A. Ludwig B. Adomeit A. Boehmer A. Boehmer F.-D. Nürnberg B. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, SW-480 cells in 24-well plates were prelabeled with 4 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol for 24 h. At 2 h prior to stimulation, the cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 μmcaptopril. The cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of bradykinin, as indicated, in the presence of LiCl for 10 min. For termination, the medium was replaced by 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After 10 min, the extracts were collected, and the trichloroacetic acid was removed by washing four times with 2 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether. After neutralization by adding Tris base, the samples were diluted to 4 ml with distilled water. The inositol phosphate fractions containing inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates were obtained by eluting five times with 2 ml of 1.0m ammonium formate and 0.1 m formic acid from AG 1-X8 columns (200–400 mesh, formate form; Bio-Rad). Radioactivity of the inositol phosphate-containing fractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting. SW-480 cells were preincubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h and then treated with the different inhibitors and/or BK as indicated in the figure legends. After stimulation, cells were scraped off and centrifuged for 1 min at 5000 × g. The medium was removed, and the pellets were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged (10 min, 15,000 ×g, 4 °C) to pellet insoluble material. The supernatants were transferred into new tubes, and Erk1 was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml of lysate) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm orthovanadate; Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5m LiCl; and kinase buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm orthovanadate). Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitates was performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, 1.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein, and 3.3 μm dithiothreitol. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis on 12% (w/v) gels. The dried gels were autoradiographed, and the radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein was quantified using a PhosphorImager (NIH Image Version 1.57). For the measurement of PKC translocation, SW-480 cells were subjected to serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h before stimulation. The cells were then exposed to BK (100 nm) for 5 min at 37 °C. For several experiments, cells were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin for 30 min. The incubation was terminated by removing the cells and centrifuging at 20,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing bacitracin (100 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mm), pepstatin A (1 μg/ml), and leupeptin (2 μg/ml) and were stored at –80 °C. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. For Western blot analysis, these membranes were separated on 7.5% gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond PVDF membranes. After blocking in 1% (w/v) BSA and 1% (w/v) nonfat dried milk powder overnight, the PVDF strips were incubated with the PKC antibodies as indicated (1 μg/ml of the blocking solution). The strips were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20; incubated for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and washed again four times as described above. Secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system by exposure to Biomax films. Cell lysates prepared as described above were incubated with anti-PKCε antibody (1 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotating drive. Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered using protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm vanadate; resuspended in 50 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, boiled for 3 min; and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 7.5% gel, followed by transfer to PVDF membranes. After blocking overnight with 3% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline and 0.5 m NaCl, PVDF blots were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used for detection with the ECL system. PI3K lipid kinase activity was determined using the method of Stephens et al.(20Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, SW-480 cells were freshly isolated; washed two times with phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium; and incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA, and 10% fetal calf serum. The SW-480 cells were then labeled overnight with 100 μCi of 32Pi/dish (6 × 106cells/2 ml). After labeling, cells were washed two times with 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.8 mmNaHCO3, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.06 mmMgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, and 0.1% BSA, pH 7.2, at 37 °C; centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min; resuspended in 0.5 ml of the above buffer; and treated with BK as indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 2.4 n HCl. Then, 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (1:2:1), 0.75 ml of chloroform/phosphoinositide mixture (with 10 μg of phosphoinositide mixture/point; Sigma), and 1 ml of chloroform were added subsequently. The mixture was thoroughly vortexed, and phase separation was performed by a short centrifugation (2500 rpm, 4 min). The lower chloroform phase was transferred to a new vial, and the upper phase was re-extracted twice with 1.5 ml of chloroform. Pooled chloroform phases were dried, and the lipids were deacylated by incubation for 1 h in methylamine (33% (v/v) in ethanol; Fluka) at 50 °C. After removal of the methylamine, the samples were resuspended in 1 ml of water and extracted twice with 1 ml of 1-butanol. The aqueous phase containing the labeled lipid head group was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (24Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In the human colon carcinoma cell line SW-480, we detected an endogenously expressed bradykinin receptor. Binding studies with [3H]BK (displacement experiments) revealed an IC50 value of ∼1 nm (Fig. 1 A). After prelabeling of SW-480 cells with myo-[3H]inositol, BK induced a concentration-dependent increase in inositol phosphate formation with an EC50 value of ∼3 nm (Fig. 1 B). The phosphatidylinositol system represents the main signaling pathway of bradykinin B2 receptors in most tissues or cells (25Farmer S.G. Burch R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 511-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both the binding parameter and the dose-response curve are in a good agreement with those for other B2receptors (25Farmer S.G. Burch R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1992; 32: 511-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As in small cell lung cancer cells (26Sethi T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3621-3623PubMed Google Scholar), BK exerted a mitogenic effect in SW-480 cells as measured with the thymidine incorporation assay. This effect of BK was completely blocked in the presence of the non-peptidic bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist FR 173657 (27Asano M. Inamura N. Hatori C. Sawai H. Fujiwara T. Katayama A. Kayakiri H. Satoh S. Abe Y. Inoue T. Sawada Y. Nakahara K. Oku T. Okuhara M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of the B2 receptor subtype in the mitogenic action of BK (Fig. 1 C). Treatment of SW-480 cells with BK led to the immediate activation of p44 MAPK as determined using the myelin basic protein assay (Fig. 2). To investigate whether activation of the MAPK pathway is required for the induction of cell division by BK, we measured the effect of BK on thymidine incorporation in the presence of PD 098059, which inhibits the activation of MAPK by blocking the activity of MAPK kinase (MEK) (28Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, both the BK-induced cell proliferation and the MAPK activation by BK were completely abolished in the presence of PD 098059 (Fig. 2). It may be concluded that the proliferation of SW-480 cells in response to BK is dependent on the activation of the MAPK pathway. In SW-480 cells, the BK-induced MAPK activation was insensitive to treatment with PTX (200 ng/ml) (Fig. 3 A). The same PTX concentration was shown to effectively inhibit MAPK activation by lysophosphatidic acid in PC-12 cells (29Graneß A. Adomeit A. Ludwig B. Müller W.-D. Kaufmann R. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides Gi and Gq/11 proteins, immunoblotting experiments with specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) revealed the presence of Gs, G12, and G13 proteins, whereas Go and Gzwere not detected in SW-480 cells (data not shown). To investigate whether the PTX-insensitive Gs protein might play a role in the mitogenic signaling pathway of BK, SW-480 cells were treated with CTX. The effect of BK on MAPK activity was clearly abolished by CTX (Fig. 3 ?B). In addition, treatment of SW-480 cells with forskolin also prevented the activation of MAPK by BK (Fig. 3 C). Since cAMP has been reported to inhibit MAPK in smooth muscle cells and some fibroblast cell lines (30Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 31Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that the permanent activated adenylate cyclase in the presence of CTX counteracts the stimulation of MAPK activity in response to BK. Next we tested two different inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and LY 294002, for their ability to affect the mitogenic action of BK in SW-480 cells. When PI3K was blocked, neither DNA synthesis (Fig. 4) nor MAPK activity (Fig. 5) was stimulated by BK, suggesting an involvement of a PI3K in the BK signaling pathway in SW-480 cells. Furthermore, two different inhibitors of PKC, bisindolylmaleimide and Ro 31-8220, were used to study the involvement of PKC in the mitogenic action of BK in SW-480 cells. As shown in Figs. 4 and 6, also in the presence of PKC inhibitors, BK failed to induce both stimulation of DNA synthesis and activation of MAPK, suggesting an involvement of protein kinase C in the mitogenic signaling pathway of BK in SW-480 cells as well. Taken together, these results obtained with different inhibitors and different experimental approaches indicate that a PI3K as well as a PKC are downstream mediators of the Gq protein-coupled bradykinin receptor in SW-480 cells.Figure 5Inhibition of MAPK activation in SW-480 cells by wortmannin and LY 294002. Serum-starved SW-480 cells were preincubated with either wortmannin (100 nm) (A) or LY 294002 (3 μm) (B, upper panel) for 30 min and then treated with BK (100 nm) for 5 min. After lysis of the cells, MAPK activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Shown are representative autoradiograms of three to four independent experiments.

The levels of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and of its metabolite, [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2, reached a maximum after 8–15 s and decreased after 1 min (data not shown). The quantity of accumulated [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and of its metabolite, [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2, is comparable to their pattern of accumulation in human neutrophils after stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe (20Stephens L.

A-kinaseanchor proteins (AKAPs) direct protein kinase A activity by tethering the enzyme near its physiological substrates. We have characterized a major human sperm fibrous sheath AKAP, hAKAP82, and its precursor, pro-hAKAP82, the homologues of the mouse fibrous sheath proteins mAKAP82 and pro-mAKAP82. The cDNA sequence of pro-hAKAP82 was highly homologous to the mouse sequence, and the functional domains of the pro-hAKAP82 protein, the protein kinase A binding, and the pro-hAKAP82/hAKAP82 cleavage sites were identical to those of the mouse protein. The genomic organization of mousepro-AKAP82 was determined. Alternative splicing occurred in both the mouse and human pro-AKAP82 genes that resulted in at least two distinct transcripts and possibly two different proteins. Compared with pro-mAKAP82, considerably less pro-hAKAP82 was processed to hAKAP82 in human sperm. Although pro-mAKAP82 localizes only to the proximal portion of the principal piece of the flagellum, pro-hAKAP82 localized to the entire length of the principal piece. The pro-hAKAP82 gene mapped to human chromosome Xp11.2, indicating that defects in this gene are maternally inherited.

Eukaryotic flagellar assembly and the regulation of flagellar motility are complex processes. For example, in the blue-green algaChlamydomonas reinhartii, more than 25 loci have been characterized that affect flagellar assembly, and over 52 loci have been identified that result in altered motility (1Bell C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 427-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In contrast toChlamydomonas, only a few of the molecular defects underlying naturally occurring cases of human flagellar immotility have been characterized (2Afzelius B.A. Eliasson R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1979; 69: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Eliasson R. Mossberg B. Camner P. Afzelius B. N. Eng. J. Med. 1977; 297: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 4Narayan D.

Nature. 1995; 374: 60-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). It is likely that the molecular basis of human sperm motility is more complicated than that of Chlamydomonas because, in addition to the axoneme, mammalian sperm have several flagellar accessory structures including a fibrous sheath (FS).1 The FS is a structure found exclusively in the principal piece of the flagellum where it surrounds the outer dense fibers and axoneme. It is believed to play a structural role in sperm motility by restricting the plane of bending of the flagellum (6Lindemann C.B. Orlando A. Kanous K.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 249-260PubMed Google Scholar). Although many of the target proteins have not been identified, it is well accepted that protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events are involved in the initiation and maintenance of mammalian sperm flagellar motility and that phosphorylation occurs via a cAMP-dependent pathway (7Tash J.S. Means A.R. Biol. Reprod. 1982; 26: 745-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 8Brokaw C.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 35: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 9Tash J.S.

In mammalian sperm, the major downstream target of cAMP is protein kinase-A (PK-A), thus making it likely that this enzyme is involved in the regulation of sperm motility (11Visconti P. Johnson L. Oyaski M. Fornes M. Moss S. Gerton G. Kopf G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although typically soluble in somatic cells, PK-A also can be found tethered to subcellular organelles via binding of its regulatory (RII) subunit to A-kinaseanchor proteins (AKAPs) (12Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar, 13Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 407-479Google Scholar, 14Scott J.D. McCartney S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In response to cAMP binding to the RII subunit of PK-A, the catalytic subunit of the kinase is released and becomes free to catalyze phosphorylation of its substrates. By tethering PK-A close to certain substrates, AKAPs may play critical roles in determining the specificity of PK-A action (15Coghlan V.M. Bergeson S.E. Langeberg L. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 309-319Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Rubin C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 467-479PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). We have cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding mouse AKAP82 (mAKAP82), the major protein of the sperm FS and a member of the AKAP family (11Visconti P. Johnson L. Oyaski M. Fornes M. Moss S. Gerton G. Kopf G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mouse AKAP82 is synthesized in the cell body of condensing spermatids as a M r 97,000 precursor (pro-mAKAP82, GenBank accession number U07423) (18Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This precursor polypeptide is transported down the flagellum to the principal piece where it is processed by the proteolytic cleavage of the amino-terminal 179 amino acids to produce mAKAP82 and the free 179 amino acid pro domain (19Johnson L. Foster J. Haig-Ladewig L. VanScoy H. Rubin C. Moss S. Gerton G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Coincident with or following cleavage, mAKAP82 is assembled into the FS. Mouse AKAP82 could tether PK-A close to the axoneme and other components of the flagellum that are involved in sperm motility, thus regulating the action of PK-A by directing its activity to specific motility-related targets. With the characterization of mAKAP82 there is now experimental evidence for a functional role of the FS as a mediator of PK-A activity. Previous work from our laboratories has shown that the human homologue of mAKAP82, hAKAP82, localizes to the FS (20Carrera A. Moos J. Ning X. Gerton G. Tesarik J. Kopf G. Moss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Additionally, both hAKAP82 and its predicted precursor protein, pro-hAKAP82, bind the RII subunit of PK-A and are the major polypeptides of a limited subset of proteins that become tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner after incubation in a medium supporting capacitation. In human sperm, capacitation is associated with several cellular changes, such as the tyrosine phosphorylation of specific proteins (20Carrera A. Moos J. Ning X. Gerton G. Tesarik J. Kopf G. Moss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 21Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S.

Reprod. 1997; 56: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), that must take place before fertilization can occur. Capacitation also is associated with alterations in sperm motility patterns characteristic of sperm hyperactivation (23Morales P. Overstreet J.W. Katz D.F. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1988; 83: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because the evidence to date is supportive of both structural and functional roles for pro-mAKAP82 and mAKAP82 in mouse sperm motility, we hypothesize that pro-hAKAP82 and hAKAP82 play central roles in human sperm motility. The hypothesis is based on the observation that these proteins are phosphoproteins that are likely to be involved in the regulation of phosphorylation of other proteins in the sperm flagellum; such phosphorylation events are known to be critical for regulating motility (7Tash J.S.

Tesarik J. Kopf G. Moss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis requires further characterization of hAKAP82 and its precursor. In this paper, we report that pro-hAKAP82 and hAKAP82 were the human homologues of pro-mAKAP82 and mAKAP82. We provide evidence that two alternative transcripts of the gene were made during both human and mouse spermatogenesis because of the use of different donor/acceptor splice junctions. Additionally, both pro-hAKAP82 and hAKAP82 localized specifically to the entire length of the FS of ejaculated sperm. Finally, we show that the pro-hAKAP82 gene mapped to human Xp11.2, a finding that has significant implications for germ cell development and male infertility. To isolate a cDNA clone corresponding topro-hAKAP82, a random-primed human testis cDNA library in a λgt11 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened by filter hybridization with a radiolabeled 1.9-kilobase pair cDNA fragment representing the 5′ end of the pro-mAKAP82 cDNA (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After multiple rounds of screening, a 1.4-kilobase pair partial pro-hAKAP82 cDNA clone homologous to the 5′-UTR and the first 1222 bp of coding sequence of pro-mAKAP82 was isolated and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM-3™ (Promega, Madison, WI). A human testis Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) clone containing an approximately 750-bp insert, which was over 90% homologous to bases 1948–2520 of the pro-mAKAP82 cDNA coding region and the pro-mAKAP82 3′-UTR, was identified by performing a BLAST (basic local alignment search tool (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (72097) Google Scholar)) search on the GenBank EST data base with the pro-mAKAP82 cDNA sequence. The human EST clone was obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium (LLNL) (I.M.A.G.E. consortium clone 726916, Research Genetics, Inc. Huntsville, AL) (26Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 27Adams M.D. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H. Merril C.R. Wu A. Olde B. Moreno R.F. Kerlavage A.R. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1651-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). To map the chromosomal location of the pro-hAKAP82 gene by fluorescencein situ hybridization (FISH), a genomic clone containingpro-hAKAP82 was isolated from a genomic human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library (in vector pBeloBAC 11) by Research Genetics using a PCR-based technique. PCR primers were designed based on the cDNA sequence for pro-hAKAP82. Sequence analysis of the BAC clone showed that it contained pro-hAKAP82. A genomic clone containing the 5′-flanking region of pro-mAKAP82 was isolated from a mouse genomic library in λGEM™-11 (Promega) using filter hybridization with a radiolabeled PCR fragment from the mouse cDNA as a probe (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A second genomic clone containing the full-length genomic sequence of pro-mAKAP82 together with its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions was isolated from a mouse P1 embryonic stem cell library using a PCR-based technique and primers derived from the pro-mAKAP82 cDNA sequence (Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO). A 1.6-kilobase pair PCR product corresponding to the region of pro-hAKAP82 that was not included in the human cDNA or EST clones (homologous to bases 437 to 2092 of the pro-mAKAP82 cDNA) was amplified by PCR from a human testis cDNA library using primers based on the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA sequence (corresponding to bases 437 to 457 of the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA coding region) and the pro-hAKAP82 EST sequence (corresponding to bases 2097 to 2077 of the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA coding region). To assay for the presence of an alternative splice variant of pro-hAKAP82, a DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from a human testis cDNA library using primers corresponding to a region in the 5′-UTR of mouse Fsc1 (GenBank accession number U10341 (28Fulcher K.D. Mori C. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. Klapper D.G. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) and to a region in the 5′ end of the coding region of the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA. PCR products were purified with the Wizard™ PCR preps kit (Promega) before sequencing. All sequencing was done with the AmpliTaq®, FS dye terminator cycle sequencing kit chemistry or the BigDye™ terminator cycle sequencing kit chemistry and the appropriate primers using a 373A DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Ambiguities were resolved by sequencing the opposite strand. DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed using the MacVector™ (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, New Haven, CT) and Sequencher™ (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) software programs. Samples of human semen were obtained by masturbation from normal, healthy donors with good sperm motility (total sperm motility greater than 75%, progressive motility greater than 60%). Ejaculate volume, percentage of total and progressively motile sperm, and sperm concentration were determined for each ejaculate. Sperm were washed 3× in PBS. Before final centrifugation, the volume, sperm concentration, and total sperm numbers again were determined for each sample. After the final wash, sperm pellets were dissolved in SDS sample buffer containing 40 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. The amount of protein in each sample was determined by the Amido Black procedure (29Schaffner W. Weissman C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). An antiserum against the predicted pro domain of pro-hAKAP82 (anti-hpro) was prepared as follows. A peptide corresponding to residues 131–145 (NH2-VGDTEGDYHRASSEN-COOH, the hpro peptide) of the pro-hAKAP82 protein was synthesized with a cysteine added to the amino terminus (Quality Control Biochemicals, Hopkinton, MA). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the cysteine and then used for immunization. The antiserum was characterized by immunoblotting using protein extracts from ejaculated human sperm. A portion of the antiserum was affinity-purified, eluted, neutralized, and dialyzed in PBS. Proteins from ejaculated human sperm were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) gel and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed in each lane. The blots were blocked, probed with anti-hpro (1:2000 (v/v)), processed, and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (19Johnson L. Foster J. Haig-Ladewig L. VanScoy H. Rubin C. Moss S. Gerton G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) before being exposed to Reflection™ film (NEN Life Science Products). For the preabsorption experiments, the antiserum was incubated with the hpro peptide (1 mg/ml) in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature and then used to probe the immunoblots as described above. One-ml aliquots of sperm diluted in PBS to 3 × 106 cells/ml were permeabilized in 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min and then washed once in PBS. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and the cells were transferred onto coverslips. After settling, cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, incubated in −20 °C methanol, washed, and blocked in normal goat serum as described previously (19Johnson L. Foster J. Haig-Ladewig L. VanScoy H. Rubin C. Moss S. Gerton G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Sperm then were incubated in anti-hpro diluted 1:10 (v/v) in 10% goat serum overnight at 4 °C and washed in PBS. Sperm were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), diluted 1:50 (v/v) in 10% goat serum, and again washed in PBS before being mounted on slides with mounting media (Fluoromount-G, Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc., Birmingham. AL). Slides were viewed with a Zeiss Photomicroscope III equipped with epifluorescence. Photographs were taken with Kodak T-Max film, 3200 ASA. Paired sample and control photographs were exposed for equal amounts of time. Localization of the pro-hAKAP82 gene to a single chromosome band was accomplished using FISH mapping. The entire human genomic BAC clone containing an insert of approximately 100 kilobase pairs, including pro-hAKAP82, was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) by nick translation and hybridized to metaphase chromosome spreads prepared from peripheral blood lymphocytes from a normal man. Labeled probe (300 ng) was incubated overnight at 37 °C with 3 μg of human cot-1 DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in Hybrisol VII (Oncor Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The probe then was denatured at 72 °C for 5 min and pre-annealed for 30 min at 37 °C. Slides were dehydrated and denatured before hybridizing overnight at 37 °C with the probe in a humidified chamber. Slides were washed in 50% formamide,1× SSC (0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate) for 10 min and then twice in 2× SSC for 4 min each. All washes were done at 40 °C with gentle shaking. Slides were transferred to a solution of 1× phosphate-buffered detergent (Oncor). Detection was performed with rhodamine-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody, and chromosomes were counterstained with diamidinophenylindole. Metaphase chromosome spreads were visualized using a Zeiss universal microscope with a Photometrics™ cooled-CCD camera and Quips™ Imaging Software (Vysis™ Inc., Downers Grove, IL). Twenty metaphase spreads with signals on both chromatids at the same band position were used to determine chromosomal location. We determined the full-length sequence of the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA by aligning and sequencing the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA clone, PCR product, and EST clone (see “Experimental Procedures”; GenBank accession number AF072756). The composite cDNA sequence contained an initiator methionine with an in-frame, upstream stop codon. The coding region of pro-hAKAP82 was 2535 bases long and contained one open reading frame, which predicted a protein of 845 amino acids and concluded with an in-frame stop codon. Although no consensus polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) were present upstream of the putative poly(A) tract, two less well conserved potential polyadenylation signals (AATACA) were present at bases 2807 and 2827. The predicted molecular weights for the various forms of the human protein were 93,500 for pro-hAKAP82 and, assuming that the cleavage site in pro-hAKAP82 is the same as in pro-mAKAP82, 73,272 for hAKAP82 and 20,244 for the pro domain (hpro). Two cDNA sequences, pro-mAKAP82 and Fsc1, have been reported for the major mouse FS protein (18Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 28Fulcher K.D. Mori C. Welch J.E. O'Brien D.A. Klapper D.G. Eddy E.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of pro-hAKAP82 was highly homologous to both of these proteins. Specifically, at least 79% of the amino acids were identical, and 91% were conserved between the mouse (both pro-mAKAP82 and Fsc1) and human sequences. Critical functional domains that have been defined previously within the mouse protein; specifically, the RII binding region (FYVNRLSSLVIQMA) and the pro-mAKAP82/mAKAP82 cleavage site (KNTNNNQSPS) (11Visconti P. Johnson L. Oyaski M. Fornes M. Moss S. Gerton G. Kopf G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were identical in the human homologue. The protein coding regions and 3′-UTRs of the pro-mAKAP82 and Fsc1 cDNAs are essentially identical; however, the 5′-UTRs of the two sequences share no homology. Furthermore, the Fsc1 5′-UTR contains an alternative in-frame start codon (27 bases upstream of the start codon for pro-mAKAP82) that could result in a protein containing an additional 9 amino acids at its amino terminus. These observations suggested that the two transcripts arise from alternative splicing of the same gene. To determine whether this was the case, genomic clones of pro-mAKAP82 and its 5′- and 3′-flanking regions were isolated and sequenced. The 5′-UTRs of both pro-mAKAP82 and Fsc1 were present in a single genomic clone and were separated from each other by 585 bp (Figs. 1, A and B), indicating that the two cDNA clones (pro-mAKAP82 and Fsc1) resulted from alternative splicing of the pro-mAKAP82 gene. The coding region of pro-mAKAP82 contained 5 exons and 4 introns with consensus splice donor/acceptor sites present at most exon/intron boundaries (Table I; GenBank accession numbers AF087516 and AF087517).

Open table in a new tab The sequences of exons and introns are indicated by capital and small letters, respectively. The 5′-UTR of the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA was highly homologous to the 5′-UTR of pro-mAKAP82 but shared no homology with the 5′-UTR of Fsc1. To determine whether the pro-hAKAP82 gene, like the mouse homologue, was alternatively spliced, we used a PCR-based approach to search for a human cDNA sequence homologous to the Fsc1 5′-UTR. Using primers corresponding to regions in the 5′-UTR of Fsc1 and the 5′ end of the coding region of the pro-hAKAP82 cDNA, an approximately 400-bp product (5′-UTRf) was amplified from a human testis cDNA library. The sequence of 5′-UTRf was highly homologous to the 5′-UTR/5′ end of the coding region of Fsc1 (67% identical bases, Fig. 1 B). The 5′-UTRf sequence, like the sequence of Fsc1, contained an alternative in-frame start codon 27 bp upstream of the start codon for pro-hAKAP82, which could result in a protein containing an additional 9 amino acids at its amino terminus compared with pro-hAKAP82. Five of these 9 deduced amino acids were identical to the 9 predicted additional amino acids of Fsc1. This finding is strong support for the concept that, like the mouse, there are at least two alternative splice variants of the pro-hAKAP82 gene, one with a 5′-UTR homologous to pro-mAKAP82 and one with a 5′-UTR homologous to Fsc1. A polyclonal antibody generated against the mature mAKAP82 protein recognizes two bands in ejaculated human sperm; one at M r 82,000 (hAKAP82) and another at M r 97,000 (20Carrera A. Moos J. Ning X. Gerton G. Tesarik J. Kopf G. Moss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, like the mouse, hAKAP82 is formed by proteolytic cleavage of a higher M r precursor, pro-hAKAP82. An antibody (anti-hpro) raised against a peptide sequence in the predicted processed (hpro) region of pro-hAKAP82 (a region presumed to be absent from mature hAKAP82) was used to probe immunoblots of ejaculated human sperm protein. Anti-hpro identified a polypeptide atM r 97,000, which is pro-hAKAP82 (Fig. 2 A). In addition, aM r 18,000 protein was detected. This protein approximates the size predicted for the hpro domain of pro-hAKAP82 (M r 20,244) and indicated that some of this fragment persisted in mature sperm. As expected, because the hpro peptide has been removed from the mature protein, no band was recognized at M r 82,000 (hAKAP82). Preabsorption of anti-hpro with the hpro peptide abolished the immunoreactivity, demonstrating that the antiserum reacted specifically with the hpro sequence. The sizes of hAKAP82 (20Carrera A. Moos J. Ning X. Gerton G. Tesarik J. Kopf G. Moss S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 284-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), pro-hAKAP82, and hpro are consistent with the hypothesis that the pro-hAKAP82/hAKAP82 cleavage site is similar, if not identical, to that of the mouse. Immunoreactivity was seen along the entire length of the principal piece when human sperm were probed with anti-hpro (Fig. 2, Band C). All sperm labeled in a similar fashion. This result is in contrast to the findings in mature cauda epididymal mouse sperm in which pro-mAKAP82 and mouse pro are found only in the proximal portion of the principal piece (19Johnson L. Foster J. Haig-Ladewig L. VanScoy H. Rubin C. Moss S. Gerton G. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Anti-hpro was specific for the FS as it reacted exclusively with the principal piece of the flagellum. The antiserum reacted specifically with the hpro sequence as immunoreactivity was not seen in samples in which anti-hpro was preabsorbed with the hpro peptide. Additionally, no staining was seen with the preimmune serum. To map the chromosomal location of the pro-hAKAP82 gene and to determine whether the gene is a candidate for any previously mapped human genetic diseases involving male infertility, we analyzed chromosomes from a normal man by FISH using a digoxigenin-11-dUTP-labeled BAC genomic clone of pro-hAKAP82. Results showed that pro-hAKAP82mapped to Xp11.2, adjacent to the centromere (Fig. 3). This region of the human X chromosome is syntenic to the most proximal end of the mouse X chromosome, the location of the pro-mAKAP82 gene (30Moss S. VanScoy H. Gerton G. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The high homology of the amino acid sequences of pro-hAKAP82, pro-mAKAP82/Fsc1, and a 75-kDa rat FS protein (76% identical to and 89% conserved with pro-hAKAP82 at the amino acid level) indicates that the structure and function of AKAP82 is highly conserved in sperm of a number of mammalian species. Of particular interest is the finding that the amino acid sequence of the RII binding site of pro-mAKAP82 (11Visconti P. Johnson L. Oyaski M. Forn"

To better understand the biogenesis of the yeast succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), we searched for assembly-defective mutants. SDH is encoded by theSDH1, SDH2, SDH3, and SDH4 genes. The holoenzyme is composed of two domains. The membrane extrinsic domain, consisting of Sdh1p and Sdh2p, contains a covalent FAD cofactor and three iron-sulfur clusters. The membrane intrinsic domain, consisting of Sdh3p and Sdh4p, is proposed to bind two molecules of ubiquinone and one heme. We isolated one mutant that is respiration-deficient with a specific loss of SDH oxidase activity. SDH is not assembled in this mutant. The complementing gene, TCM62 (also known as SCYBR044C), does not encode an SDH subunit and is not essential for cell viability. It encodes a mitochondrial membrane protein of 64,211 Da. The Tcm62p sequence is 17.3% identical to yeast hsp60, a molecular chaperone. The Tcm62p amino terminus is in the mitochondrial matrix, whereas the carboxyl terminus is accessible from the intermembrane space. Tcm62p forms a complex containing at least three SDH subunits. We propose that Tcm62p functions as a chaperone in the assembly of yeast SDH."

Trypanosoma brucei sp., the causative agent of Ngana in ungulates and sleeping sickness in humans, is a parasitic protozoan pathogen seriously affecting public health and the economy in endemic regions. Suramin, a drug currently used in management of African trypanosomiasis, is believed to enter the parasite via endocytosis (18Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Field, unpublished data. 1H. Field and M. C. Field, unpublished data. T. brucei additionally provides a convenient model system for elucidation of cell biological processes in a divergent eukaryote with a strongly directional endocytotic/recycling system, where a very small portion of the total membrane (2–3%, Ref. 20Webster P. Russell D.G. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 201-206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) is the site of all endo- and exocytosis. Recycling is very active in T. brucei, with more than 95% of endocytosed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) recycled (21Duszenko M. Seyfang A. Tartakoff A.M. Plattner H. Advances in Cell and Molecular Biology of Membranes. JAI Press Inc., CT1993: 227-258Google Scholar). Here we report on the subcellular location and evolution of three TbRab proteins involved in endocytosis in T. brucei. Culture-adapted blood stream form (BSF)2 T. brucei, strain 427, were grown as described (22Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were quantitated with a Z2 Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, UK). For boiling SDS lysates, freshly harvested trypanosomes were added to SDS-PAGE sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) at 95 °C, heated for 10 min, and reduced with dithiothreitol. Treatment with fluorescent endocytotic markers was at 3–4 mg/ml added from 10× stock, in 100 μl of culture medium, with (for Texas red-dextran, Molecular Probes) or without (for Lucifer yellow, Sigma) serum. Nitrocellulose for Western and Southern blotting was from Schleicher and Schuell, and nylon for Northern blots was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Radioisotopes were from Amersham International, ICN, and NEN Life Science Products. Vector pGEX2tk and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and the pQE30 vector and nickel-Sepharose were from Qiagen Inc. Plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) following transformation by electroporation with a BTX 600 ECM electroporator. PCR products and gel-embedded DNA were purified using PCR cleanup kits (Promega), while plasmid and λ DNA were purified using Qiagen kits following the manufacturer’s instructions. Small scale plasmid preparations were performed using the Promega Wizard system. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Genosys. PCR was performed in 50-μl reactions with 25 pmol of each primer in ammonium buffer (Bioline), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Bioline) in a 480 thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer) typically as follows: 98 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 95 °C, 5 min (1 cycle); 94 °C, 1 min; 56 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3.5 min (25 cycles). Primers for subcloning and assembling ORFs for expression were: 5BH3 (5′-TCCAAGCTTTCAACCACAGCAACCGGA), 5BKON (5′-CGGGGTACCTCTGTGAAGACCGTTGCCG), 5A5′ (5′-CGCGAATTCATATGTCGTGTCAGCGACACC), and 5A3′ (5′-GAGAGCGGTAGCGCTCCTGCCC). 0.5-μg aliquots of total trypanosome DNA (24Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were digested with restriction enzyme, and the fragments resolved on 1% Tris-acetate-EDTA agarose gels. Molecular weights were estimated from comigration of a 1-kb DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). Filters were prepared by high salt transfer Southern blotting (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar) and probed at low (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, room temperature) or high stringency (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C). Poly(A) enriched RNA was isolated (Hybaid Plc), and Northern blot filters were prepared using 20 μg of RNA or RNA from 108trypanosomes/lane, separated on a formamide-MOPS agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide followed by transfer in 20× SSC. Molecular weights were estimated from comigration of RNA markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) and trypanosome rRNA species at 1600, 1900, and 2300 bases. Probes were prepared as follows; full-length ORFs from 2 μg of TbRAB5A, -5B, or -4, and a fragment of tubulin (NotI/XbaI fragment from pXS2, Ref. 26Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J.

DNA was labeled by random hexamer priming (Boehringer-Mannheim) using 50 μCi [α-32P]dCTP and purified by size exclusion (Centrisep). Autoradiography was with BioMax film (Kodak) at −85 °C with an intensifying screen or by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Images were quantitated with NIH Image 1.59 (National Institutes of Health). Sanger sequencing of the TbRAB5BORF and noncoding region was performed using a deaza-GTP kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and primer walking in both directions. All other sequence analysis was by dye terminator cycle sequencing on a 377 sequencer (Perkin Elmer) from polyethylene glycol-precipitated DNA (6.5% PEG8000, 0.4 m NaCl on ice 20 min, centrifuged at 13,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min, washed with 70% EtOH). cDNA encoding TbRab5Bp was isolated from a T. brucei BSF cDNA library in λZAP (gift of Dr. John Mansfield, University of Wisconsin) using Rtb4 as a probe (27Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Screening and recovery of the phagemid was as described (22Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1995; 69: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TheTbRAB5B ORF was PCR amplified from the cDNA, engineering a 5′ HindIII site and a 3′ KpnI site (primers 5BH3, 5BKON). The PCR product was ligated intoKpnI/HindIII-restricted pQE30 (Qiagen Inc.). The construct was verified by sequencing and expression in E. coli, producing a 23-kDa protein, the predicted molecular weight for a (His)6·TbRab5Bp fusion. TheTbRAB5A ORF (a gift from Dr. Nabib El-Sayed) was constructed from clone 22, encoding the N terminus of TbRab5Ap, 3N. El-Sayed, unpublished data. which was PCR amplified (primers 5A5′, 5A3′) to produce overlappingEcoRI/NdeI sites at the 5′ end and finishing at an existing Eco47III site; the PCR product was subcloned and then ligated into EcoRI- and Eco47III-cleaved clone T378, which encodes the majority of TbRab5Ap in pBluescript (29El-Sayed N.M.A. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ORF was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. The plasmid was cleaved with XhoI (3′ to the ORF) and blunt ended with Klenow, and the ORF was released with BamHI and ligated into BamHI/SmaI-cleaved pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create an in-frame fusion with glutathioneS-transferase (GST; a synthetic 4-amino acid linker is present). The construct was verified by expression in E. coli, producing a 56-kDa protein, the predicted molecular mass for a GST·TbRab5Ap fusion. TheTbRAB4 ORF (a gift from Dr. Nabib El-Sayed) was constructed from clone 452–5c, encoding the N terminus of TbRab4p,3was PCR amplified, producing a 5′ EcoRI site and finishing at an existing BsaBI site, and subcloned via these restriction sites directly into clone T452, encoding the majority of TbRab4p in pBluescript (29El-Sayed N.M.A. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The ORF was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. Expression plasmids pGEX-3X·TbRAB5A and pQE30·TbRAB5B in E. coli were grown in L-broth and induced with 0.2–1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST-TbRab5Ap fusion protein was affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (22Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar); cleavage was with Factor Xa (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 2 h, adding more enzyme after 1 h. His6·TbRab5Bp protein was purified on nickel-Sepharose. Protein was estimated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Typical yields were 0.4–4 mg of recombinant TbRab protein/liter E. coli. Antibodies to TbRab4p, -5Ap, and -5Bp were raised against synthetic peptides designed from the C termini and coupled to bovine serum albumin. Additional residues were included in TbRab4 and -5A peptides, to facilitate detection and derivatization. Peptides WGENGHAETLYDGPKRFSC (-4), WYGAQRLEPPTRQQKKEGGC (-5A), and ACKGVLGGQPNSTRRSSGC (-5B) were synthesized (Dr. R. Leatherbarrow, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College) and verified for purity by high performance liquid chromatography and for sequence by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, following standard methods. A portion of the peptide was iodinated with IodoBeads (Pierce) or Bolton-Hunter reagent (-5B) and used as a tracer. Peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin with an efficiency of ∼40%, usingm-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinamide ester (Pierce) following standard procedures (24Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The conjugate was used to immunize rabbits and rats using the MPL® + TDM + CWS Adjuvant System (Sigma). Animals were exsanguinated, and serum was stored at 4 °C with azide. For affinity purification, peptide was coupled to either thiol-Sepharose (-5B) or CNBr-Sepharose following the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies were affinity purified from serum after 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation (31Harlow, E., and Lane, D. (eds) (1988) Antibodies, a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE. For Western blots, 5 × 106−2 × 107 cells per lane were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and blotted (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose. Filters were processed at room temperature. After blocking for 1 h in buffer A (20 mm potassium-Hepes, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1–1% Tween 20, 110 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.4, containing 2% non-fat milk (Marvel)), filters were washed three times briefly, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antisera at 1:20,000 (Sigma) for 1 h, washed in Buffer A, and then in Buffer A without milk. Visualization was with ECL™ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and x-ray film (Kodak). GTP overlay assay was performed on 107 trypanosomes/lane electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Wilson A.L. Sheridan K.M. Erdman R.A. Maltese W.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). IFA was as described previously (33Sherwin T. Read M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 407-414PubMed Google Scholar). BSF and procyclic trypanosomes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma), allowed to settle onto poly-lysine coated slides (Sigma) for 3 min (on ice for BSF), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and then treated with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Purified anti-TbRab peptide antibodies were used at 1:50–100 dilution. Secondary antibodies were conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma), Texas Red, Oregon 488 (Molecular Probes), or Cy3 (Jackson). Cells were examined on a Leica DMRXA epifluorescence microscope fitted with a Photometrics CH250 Slow Scan CCD camera, and digital images were captured using IP Lab Spectrum 3.1. Alternatively, photography was as described (22Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), with images digitized by scanning photographs (Scanmaker II, Microtek). Resulting images were false-colored, merged, and assembled into figures (Adobe® Photoshop 3.0.5, Adobe® Systems, Inc.) on a MacOS computer (Apple Inc.). Computer analysis was as described (22Field H. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10498-10505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 was generated using SEQVU (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sidney, Australia). AT. brucei homologue of mammalian Rab5 was previously isolated (T.b. Rab5, Ref. 29El-Sayed N.M.A. Alarcon C.M. Beck J.C. Sheffield V.C. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 75-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); we designate it TbRab5Ap. A second Rab5 homologue was identified in T. brucei by reverse transcriptase PCR using a degenerate primer to the WDTAGQE motif of Rab GTPases. An EST, Rtb4 (27Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), was used to probe a T. brucei BSF cDNA library. A full-length cDNA of ∼2.0 kb was cloned and sequenced. The ORF was hypothetically translated and identified as a Rab5 homologue (Fig. 1 A) by BLAST search of GenBankTM and designated TbRab5Bp. Neither T. brucei Rab5 clearly corresponded to a particular Rab5 subclass. Comparison of TbRab5Bp with -5Ap and other Rab5 protein sequences (Fig. 1 A, and Table I) confirmed the conservation of canonical Rab protein features, i.e.GTP-binding regions, effector loops, and dicysteinyl C-terminal isoprenylation signal (34Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14497-14503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but two differences were seen between TbRab5Ap and -5Bp. The first is an insertion in TbRab5Ap (residues 61–77) with a high Ala and Gly content; this region corresponds to a loop between β-sheets 2 and 3 in the Ras structure and is predicted to be on the protein surface and highly mobile. The second is a deletion in -5Bp within the hypervariable region (Fig. 1 A); this is more common as similar but smaller indels are found in this region of mammalian Rab5 s and TbRab5Ap when compared with Ypt51p, -52p, and -53p (not shown).Table IHomology between TbRab5Ap, −5Bp, and closest homologues in the data baseThe hypothetical translations of the TbRAB5A and −5B ORFs were used to search GenBank.™ The top scoring match is shown in each case. Values above the diagonal are percent similarity and below percent identity. Open table in a new tab The hypothetical translations of the TbRAB5A and −5B ORFs were used to search GenBank.™ The top scoring match is shown in each case. Values above the diagonal are percent similarity and below percent identity. By BLAST search, the nearest homologue of TbRab5Ap was Ypt51p and of -5Bp wasCanis familiaris Rab5c (Table I). TbRab5Ap and -5Bp were as similar to each other as to their nearest homologues (Table I) so could not be assigned to specific Rab5 subgroups. A phylogeny for the Rab5 lineage was constructed, using Clustal (4.0) followed by PAUP, on sequences representative of the subclasses of Rab5 so far identified in mammals (Rab5a, -5b, and -5c) and the three Rab5 homologues fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Ypt51p, -52p, and -53p). Rab5 proteins from any one of the three lineages were monophyletic (Fig. 1 B). The simplest interpretation of this topology is that proliferation of the Rab5 subclasses occurred after speciation and that a single progenitor Rab5 gene was present in the eukaryote common ancestor. Because TbRab5Ap and -5Bp are closely related, we asked whether the genes encoding them (TbRAB5Aand -5B) were linked in the genome. Trypanosome genomic DNA, digested with a panel of restriction enzymes, was Southern blotted and probed with the complete ORFs of TbRAB5A and -5B(Fig. 2 A). No cross-hybridization between probes was detected using plasmids as targets at low stringency (not shown). There was no coincidence between the hybridization patterns obtained with TbRAB5A and -5B, reflected in the different maps obtained for the two genes (Fig. 2 B). The TbRAB5B probe revealed the presence of a restriction fragment-length polymorphism (Fig. 2 B, asterisk) giving a doublet in SacII digests although previous Southern blot analysis of the trypanosome genome with the Rtb4 probe (the 5′ third of the -5B ORF) suggested that TbRAB5Bwas single copy (27Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In our original EST study, we isolated a second partial cDNA (Rtb9) closely related to Rtb4but with a small number of substitutions (27Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These data suggest thatRtb4 and Rtb9 are derived from allelic copies of TbRAB5B. There was no additional hybridization with the TbRAB5A or-5B probes. As these two probes do not cross-hybridize at low stringency, there are no sequences more closely related toTbRAB5A than -5B and vice versa in the trypanosome genome, but more distantly related TbRAB5 genes may have been undetectable and therefore cannot be formally excluded. Southern analysis with the TbRAB4 ORF revealed a single copy, with no evidence for linkage between TbRAB4 and any other TbRAB gene so far studied (Fig. 2 A, Ref.27Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-enriched RNA from 108 trypanosomes (3.4 μg from BSF and 10 μg from procyclics: the differing RNA yield is a known phenomenon 4J. Boothroyd, personal communication. ) was used in each lane of a Northern blot and probed with ORFs from TbRAB4, -5A, and -5B (Fig. 3). TbRAB4 detected a single major species migrating at ∼0.7 kb, with the ORF of 718 nt suggesting minimal untranslated sequence (UTR), and TbRAB5A detected a single species of ∼1.0 kb, with the ORF of 930 nt so there is again very little UTR. In contrast, TbRAB5B detected larger message species. As the 5′ UTR is 150 nt and the ORF 612 nt, the 3′ UTR is ∼1.2 kb and could potentially include regulatory sequences. The message levels were at a ratio of ∼10:20:1 for TbRab4:-5A:-5B, with -5B particularly difficult to detect because of low abundance and molecular weight heterogeneity, differing in BSF (3.8, 2.4, 2.1*, 1.8, 1.35 kb) and procyclics (3.8*, 2.3, 1.95* kb, where asterisks indicate the prominent message sizes). The 3.8-kb message probably represents an unprocessed nuclear transcript. The 2.0-kb cDNA clone containingTbRAB5B is consistent with a message size of 2.1–2.4 kb. For quantitation, the blots were reprobed with tubulin as a constitutively expressed standard; the signal intensity was at ∼1:4 for BSF:procyclics and ∼1:1 with the mass of RNA loaded. When normalized to tubulin, both TbRab4 and -5A messages were constitutive. The 3.8-kb TbRab5B message is also constitutive; conversely the ∼1.8–2.4-kb -5B transcripts normalized to tubulin at a ratio of 1:0.5, indicating more processed -5B message in BSF than in procyclics. In separate experiments loading equal masses of BSF and procyclic poly(A)-enriched RNA or poly(A)-selected RNA, hybridization signals forTbRAB5B were more intense in BSF, confirming that TbRab5Bp is developmentally regulated 5H. Field, A. Pal, and M. C. Field, unpublished data. (Ref. 27Field M.C. Boothroyd J.C. Exp. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GTPase activity was assessed in the two life stages by GTP overlay of lysates from 107 BSF or procyclic cells (Fig. 4). Total protein levels are approximately equal for both BSF and procyclic cells (Fig. 4).1 The pattern of GTP-bound bands was essentially identical, while significantly more GTP was bound by BSF lysate than procyclic. Rat (anti-TbRab4p and -5Ap) and rabbit antisera (-5Bp) were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the C termini of the TbRab sequences and affinity purified, and the specificity of anti-TbRab5Ap and -5Bp sera were checked by Western blotting against lysates of E. coli overexpressing recombinant TbRab (Fig. 5 A). Anti-TbRab5Ap recognized recombinant -5Ap but not -5Bp, and vice versa. No signal was observed using anti-TbRab4p or -5Ap antibodies in Western blotting on trypanosome lysates (Fig. 5 B, and data not shown). Extra residues added to the TbRab5Ap and -4p peptides may explain their relative lack of reactivity in Westerns, but inactivity in Western blotting is commonly observed for anti-Rab C-terminal peptide antibodies that work well in IFA (35Zerial M.

PTL and PLRP2 differ in substrate specificity, bile acid inhibition, colipase requirement, and interfacial activation. To begin understanding the structural explanations for these functional differences, we solved the crystal structure of rat (r)PLRP2 and further characterized its kinetic properties. The 1.8 Å structure of rPLRP2, like the tertiary structure of human PTL, has a globular N-terminal domain and a β-sandwich C-terminal domain. The lid domain occupied the closed position, suggesting that rPLRP2 should show interfacial activation. When we reexamined this issue with tripropionin as substrate, rPLRP2 exhibited interfacial activation. Because the active site topology of rPLRP2 resembled that of human PTL, we predicted and demonstrated that the lipase inhibitors E600 and tetrahydrolipstatin inhibit rPLRP2. Although PTL and rPLRP2 have similar active sites, rPLRP2 has a broader substrate specificity that we confirmed using a monolayer technique. With this assay, we showed for the first time that rPLRP2 prefers phosphatidylglycerol and ethanolamine over phosphatidylcholine. In summary, we confirmed and extended the observation that PLRP2 lipases have a broader substrate specificity than PTL, we demonstrated that PLRP2 lipases show interfacial activation, and we solved the first crystal structure of a PLRP2 lipase that contains a lid domain.

Lipases are ubiquitous enzymes expressed by diverse organisms. They hydrolyze phospholipids and triglycerides to generate fatty acids for energy production or for storage and to release inositol phosphates that act as second messengers. The role of phospholipases in cellular signaling pathways has increased interest in these lipases. Similarly, the central role of triglyceride lipases in energy production and their potential industrial applications have stimulated studies of these essential lipases. As a result, our knowledge about lipases and of the molecular details underlying lipolysis has increased considerably. Among these contributions was the cloning of cDNAs encoding various lipases. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences predicted from these cDNAs led to the hypothesis that a lipase gene family evolved from a common ancestral hydrolase (1Kirchgessner T.G. Chuat J.-C.

At least three members of the lipase gene family are synthesized and secreted by the pancreas. One, the archetype of the family, colipase-dependent pancreatic triglyceride lipase (PTL)1has been studied for over 100 years. Giller et al. (2Giller T. Buchwald P. Blum-Kaelin D. Hunziker W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16509-16516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated human pancreatic cDNAs encoding the other two, named pancreatic lipase-related proteins 1 and 2 (PLRP1 and PLRP2), 6 years ago. The primary sequences of the human PLRP1 and PLRP2 have 68 and 65% identity to the primary sequence of PTL with conservation of the catalytic triad and major determinants of tertiary structure. Subsequently, other groups reported the presence of related proteins in the pancreas from several species (3Payne R.M. Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Am. J.

These studies provided the first indications that PLRP2 has functional properties different from those of PTL. Mouse PLRP2 was cloned from interleukin-4-stimulated cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and rat (r)PLRP2 was cloned as a zymogen granule membrane protein, GP3 (4Wishart M.J. Andrews P.C. Nichols R.

The presence of PLRP2 in lymphocytes and on the zymogen granule membrane raised the possibility that PLRP2 has functions other than hydrolyzing dietary fats. For instance, lymphocyte PLRP2 may participate in cell killing, and the PLRP2 on the zymogen granule membrane may mediate granule fusion with the plasma membrane. The expression and purification of PLRP2 lipases allowed the enzymatic properties of these enzymes to be characterized. These studies revealed that PLRP2 lipases have enzymatic properties that distinguish them from PTL (4Wishart M.J. Andrews P.C. Nichols R. Blevins Jr., G.T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol.

First, PLRP2 has a broader substrate specificity and will hydrolyze triglycerides, phospholipids, and galactolipids. PTL hydrolyzes only triglycerides. Second, they have different behaviors in the presence of bile salts and with colipase. Third, PLRP2 members efficiently hydrolyze monomers of water-soluble, short chain triglycerides, whereas PTL possesses low activity against monomeric substrates. PTL activity increases dramatically against water-insoluble substrates presenting an oil-water interface, a property known as interfacial activation. Clearly, the explanation for these kinetic and functional differences must lie in the structure of these proteins. The first pancreatic lipase structure to be solved was that of the human enzyme (hPTL) (10Winkler F.K. D’Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the complex of hPTL with porcine colipase was elucidated, as were the structures of hPTL-porcine colipase in complex with phospholipid or phosphonate inhibitors (10Winkler F.K.

The structures of horse PTL, hPTL-human colipase complex, and porcine PTL-porcine colipase complex have also been determined (14Bourne Y. Martinex C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J.

The structures of hPTL-porcine colipase crystallized in the presence of mixed phospholipid/bile salt micelles or of a C11 phosphonate inhibitor revealed that the lid domain (residues 237–261) covering the active site of hPTL could move away from its closed position (12van Tilbeurgh H.

Another structural element, the β5 loop, undergoes a spatial reorganization and folds back on the core of the protein. These drastic conformational changes, leading to the open conformation, give substrate free access to the catalytic triad. Comparisons of PLRP2 and PTL family members requires high resolution crystal structures, but no structure of a true PLRP2 is available. Withers-Martinez et al. (38Withers-Martinez C. Carriere F. Verger R. Bourgeois D. Cambillau C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1363-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of a chimeric lipase with the C-terminal domain of human PTL and the N-terminal domain of guinea pig PLRP2 (gPLRP2). Although inferences about the conformation of PLRP2 can be made from the known PTL and gPLRP2 structure, valid conclusions must be based on the actual PLRP2 structure. In this paper, we report the first crystal structure of a PLRP2 family member that has a lid domain and further characterize the enzymatic properties of this lipase. We expressed recombinant rat PLRP2 in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described previously with the following modifications (3Payne R.M. Sims H.F. Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G914-G921PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2374-2381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was produced in 1-liter spinner flasks containing 350 ml of serum-free medium, EX-CELL 400 (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), instead of 1 liter of medium. We harvested the medium 3 days instead of 4 days post-infection. The smaller medium volume and shorter culture times gave higher protein yields as initially observed by Bezzine et al. (17Bezzine S. Ferrato F. Lopez V. de Caro A. Verger R. Carriére F. Doolittle M.H. Reue K. Methods in Molecular Biology. 109. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 187-202Google Scholar). We removed cells and debris by centrifuging the medium at 5000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman J2–21 centrifuge with a JA-20 rotor. The medium was concentrated over a Pall Filtron 10k Ultrasette membrane (Filtron Technology Corporation, Northborough, MA) to about 50 ml and dialyzed by repeated dilution with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and concentrating over the Ultrasette membrane. We applied the sample to a 75-ml bed volume DEAE-Blue-Sepharose (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in the Tris buffer. PLRP2 was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.0 to 0.6 m. Assay with tributyrin in a pH-stat located the PLRP2. We pooled the peak fractions and dialyzed against 10 mm MES, pH 6.2, buffer followed by concentration over an Amicon YM30 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). The sample was applied to a Pharmacia Mono-S column (5-ml bed volume) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) attached to an Akta Purifier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated in 50 mm MES, pH 6.2, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.0 to 1.0 m. rPLRP2 eluted from the column as a symmetrical peak identified by activity against tributyrin. The peak fractions were pooled, and the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with 1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. The purified protein migrated as a single band on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and had activity against tributyrin, trioctanoin, triolein, and phosphotidylcholine as described previously (8Jennens M.L. Lowe M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2374-2381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rPLRP2 concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay using purified bovine serum albumin as the standard. 1,2-rac-Didecanoyl glycerol (dicaprin) was purchased from Sigma. 1,2-sn-Didodecanoyl phosphatidylcholine, 1,2-sn-didodecanoyl phosphatidylethanolamine, and 1,2-sn-didodecanoyl phosphatidylglycerol were purchased from Fluka (Paris, France). 3-Monogalactosyl-1,2-rac-didodecanoyl glycerol was prepared by chemical synthesis and is a generous gift from Professor G. C. Ortaggi (Roma). A rPLPR2 solution 0.5 mg/ml was used for kinetic experiments using the monolayer technique as well as for the interfacial activation experiments, using tripropionin as substrate. Bulk phase assays were done by the pH-stat method as described (5Thirstrup K. Verger R. Carriére F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2748-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Jennens M.L.

Tetrahydrolipstatin was kindly provided by Dr. Hans Lengsfeld from Hoffmann-LaRoche. Before each utilization, the Teflon trough used to form the monomolecular film was cleaned with water, then gently brushed in the presence of distilled ethanol, washed again with tap water, and finally rinsed with double-distilled water (19Ransac S. Ivanova M.G. Verger R. Panaiotov I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 263-292Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Verger R. de Haas G.H. Chemistry Phys. Lipids. 1973; 10: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The aqueous subphase was composed of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 21 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm EDTA for all lipases. The buffer was prepared with double-distilled water and filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter. Any residual surface-active impurities were removed before each assay by sweeping and suction of the surface. Kinetic experiments were performed with a KSV-2200 barostat (KSV-Helsinki) and a “zero-order” Teflon trough (20Verger R. de Haas G.H. Chemistry Phys. Lipids. 1973; 10: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The trough was equipped with a mobile Teflon barrier, which was used to compensate for the substrate molecules removed from the film by enzyme hydrolysis (monodecanoyl glycerol, decanoic acid, lyso-dodecanoyl phospholipids, and dodecanoic acid are soluble in water), thereby keeping the surface pressure constant. The latter was measured using a Wilhelmy plate (perimeter 3.94 cm) attached to an electromicrobalance, which was connected in turn to a microprocessor controlling the movement of the mobile barrier. The reactions were performed at room temperature (20 °C). The subphase of the reaction compartment was continuously agitated with a 2.0-cm magnetic stirrer moving at 250 rpm. The rPLRP2 solution (10–60 μl at 0.5 mg/ml) was injected through the film over the stirrer with a Hamilton syringe. The surface area of the reaction compartment was 31 cm2, and the volume was 55 ml. The length of the reservoir compartment was 30 cm, and the width was 17.6 cm. The TC3solutions were systematically prepared by mixing three times 30 s in a Waring blender, a given amount of TC3 in 15 ml of 1% gum arabic in water (w/w) (21Ferrato F. Carriére F. Sarda L. Verger R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 327-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Before each assay, 5 ml of the TC3 gum arabic solution was added to 10 ml of pure water in the thermostated (37 °C) pH-stat vessel. Deionized water, purified with a Millipore Super Q system, was used throughout all the experiments. Lipase activity was recorded with either a TTT 80 pH-stat (Radiometer) equipped with a 250-μl syringe containing 0.1n NaOH or a VIT 90 pH-stat (Radiometer) equipped with an automatic burette containing 0.05 m NaOH. Activity was measured potentiometrically at pH 7.0, because at pH 8.0 the spontaneous hydrolysis of TC3 reaches relatively high levels. The assay was carried out on a mechanically stirred solution of substrate in the reaction vessel. Spontaneous hydrolysis was recorded in the pH-stat mode for 2 min before lipase injection, and this background value was subtracted from the activity measurement. One international lipase unit is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the release of 1 μmol fatty acid/min. Each assay contained a 5-fold molar excess of pure colipase. We checked that bovine serum albumin (final concentration, 1%) had no detectable catalytic activity on a TC3 solution (7.7 mm) or on a TC3 emulsion (15.33 mm). Interfacial activation assays withp-nitrophenylbutyrate were done as described (22Martinelle M. Holmquist M. Hult K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Small crystals of rPLRP2 were obtained at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, by mixing 2 μl of protein (18 mg/ml in 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5) and 2 μl of the Hampton screen 1 solution 36 (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, CA) containing 8% polyethylene glycol 8000 and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4. Crystals were improved by diminishing the polyethylene glycol and protein concentrations by a factor of two. Larger crystal were obtained by macroseeding using a 4+4 μl mixture and 2% polyethylene glycol 8000. The crystals were soaked in a synthetic mother liquor containing 33% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant and were subsequently cryocooled using the Oxford equipment (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK). X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.80 Å resolution on a 30-cm Mar-research imaging plate at 0.970 Å wavelength on beamline DW32 in LURE (Orsay, France). The data were processed using the DENZO software package (23Otwinovsky A. DENZO: An oscillation data processing program for macromolecular crystallography. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The rPLRP2 crystallizes in the space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 57.4 Å,b = 79.1 Å, c = 60.9 Å, and β = 102.1°. Specific volume calculations yielded one molecule/asymmetric unit, with a V m of 2.7 Å3/Da and a solvent content of approximately 54% (24Mathews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar). A total number of 36,060 unique reflections were indexed using the SCALEPACK program with an R-factor on intensities of 6.3%, a data set multiplicity of 2.4 and a completeness of 97.5%, between 10.0 and 1.8 Å (Table I) (25Navaza J.

Open table in a new tab The structure was solved with the molecular replacement method using the AMoRe program (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The closed form of the classical human pancreatic lipase was used as the search model. The rotation function of the two bodies, performed with the N-terminal domain without the lid and the C-terminal domain, yielded only one significant solution for the entire molecule (correlation coefficient of 0.50 and R-factor of 0.39 between 10.0 and 3.5 Å resolution). The structure was refined using the X-PLOR program (26Brunger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1 manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). After performing 12 cycles of slow cooling protocol starting at 2000 K and manual replacement and adjustments using the Turbo-Frodo program, the R-factor had decreased from 45 to 24.6% (R-free 31.8%) (27Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 86Google Scholar). The water molecules located in the (2F o − F c) and (F o − F c) maps numbered 295, and one Glc-NAc sugar bound to Asn334 was identified. Seven molecules of ethylene glycol were modeled in the density. The R-factor calculated with 36,060 reflections between 10.0 and 1.80Å resolution was 20.3% and the final R-free factor calculated with 5% reflections was equal to 24.2% (Table I). The Ramachandran plat and the electron density map (see Fig. 1) further demonstrate the quality of the model. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 1bu8. The structure of rPLRP2 has been refined at the highest resolution observed among the pancreatic lipases. The current model consists of 3505 protein atoms, one GlcNAc connected to Asn334, one calcium ion, seven molecules of ethylene glycol, and 295 water molecules. One protein segment, located between residues 405 and 411, was found to have no interpretable electron density and was therefore removed from the model. In the Ramachandran plot (Procheck software) of the final model, all of the main chain dihedral angles but one (Ser152) fell within the allowed regions (90.5% in the most favorable regions, and 9.3% in additional allowed regions) (28Laskowski R.A. MacArtur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Applied Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The active site Ser152has the ε conformation found in other lipases and in the α/β hydrolase fold family and is therefore located in a “generously allowed region” (28Laskowski R.A. MacArtur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Applied Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 29Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). The glycosylated Asn334 is conserved in all PLRP2 lipases except the coypu. This glycosylation site was not present in the structure of the gPLRP2/hPTL chimera because the C-terminal domain originated from hPTL. The PLRP1 glycosylation site at position 138 is not present in PTL or in PLRP2 lipases (30Roussel A. deCaro J. Bezzine S. Gastinel L. de Caro A. Carriére F. Leydier S. Verger R. Cambillau C. Proteins. 1998; 32: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Another potential glycosylation site in classical lipases is located at position 166 but is only partially conserved (14Bourne Y. Martinex C. Kerfelec B. Lombardo D. Chapus C. Cambillau C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 109-732Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is not present in PLRP1 or PLRP2 lipases. Due to cryocooling, high resolution, and low B-factors, seven molecules of cryoprotectant can be observed in the electron density map. The ethylene glycol molecules are stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds and in part by hydrophobic interactions. Hydrogen bonds are established with Arg side chains (four cases) and with main and side chains of various semi-polar and polar residues. Hydrophobic interactions involve aromatics (four cases) and aliphatic residues (two cases). The rPLRP2 structure belongs to the α/β hydrolase fold family of proteins (29Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1848) Google Scholar). The protein consists of two main domains, a globular N-terminal domain and a β-sandwich C-terminal domain. This structure closely resembles the structure of hPTL and the other members of the pancreatic lipase fold family (see Fig. 2 A) (10Winkler F.K. D’Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The core of the N-terminal domain of the molecule consists of a tightly packed β-sheet surrounded by five helices. The rPLRP2 lid, which adopts a closed conformation, has an electron density of excellent quality and does not show any sign of disorder or particular flexibility (Fig. 1). Its B-factors display the same pattern as in other closed pancreatic lipases (data not shown). The lid is located between the two sides of the bridged cysteine residues 237–261. Together with the β5 loop, it adopts the same conformation as that observed in the closed structure of hPTL (10Winkler F.K. D’Arcy A. Hunziker W. Nature. 1990; 343: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The active site is located at the bottom of a hydrophobic crevice that is covered by the lid. The catalytic triad (Ser152, His263, and Asp176) includes the nucleophile belonging to the usual consensus sequence G-X-(nucleophile)-X-G (Fig. 2 A). The structure of rPLRP2 has been superimposed on all the known pancreatic lipase structures: hPTL, hPTL bound to porcine colipase (hPTL-pCol), hPL-pCol in complex with a C11 phosphonate inhibitor (hPTL-pCol-C11), horse pancreatic lipase, gPLRP2, dog pancreatic PLRP1, and porcine pancreatic lipase bound to porcine colipase (pPTL-pCol). The N-terminal catalytic domains of the various molecules superimpose well (within 1.0 Å), apart from the mobile loops (the lid and the β5 loop), which switch between the closed and open conformations. The degree of structural homology of rPLRP2 compared with the other lipases found in the closed conformation (dog PLRP1, hPTL, and horse PTL) is remarkable (Fig. 2 B). As described previously, the C-terminal domain orientations of the structures included in the comparisons were found to differ due to rotations of a few degrees occurring around hinge residue 337 (Fig. 2 B) (11van Tilbeurgh H. Sarda L. Verger R. Cambillau C. Nature. 1992; 359: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C.

These cells also generate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), thereby allowing myeloperoxidase to generate a range of oxidizing intermediates and stable end products. When this system acts on l-tyrosine in vitro, it forms o, o′-dityrosine, which is enriched in atherosclerotic lesions. Myeloperoxidase, therefore, may oxidize artery wall proteins in vivo, cross-linking theirl-tyrosine residues. In these studies, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to identify an oxidizing intermediate in this reaction pathway and in parallel reactions catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Using an EPR flow system to rapidly mix and examine solutions containing horseradish peroxidase, H2O2, and l-tyrosine, we detected free tyrosyl radical (a 2,6 H = 6.3 G,a 3,5 H = 1.6 G, and a β H = 15.0 G). We then used spin trapping techniques with 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP) to further identify this intermediate. The resulting three-line spectrum (aN = 15.6 G) was consistent with an MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adduct. Additional MNP spin trapping studies with ring-labeledl-[13C6]tyrosine yielded a characteristic eight-line EPR spectrum (a N = 15.6 G, a 13 C (2Klebanoff S.J. Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Function and Clinical Disorders. Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, New York1978Google Scholar) = 8.0 G, a 13 C (1Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 1989; 24: 271-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) = 1.3 G), indicating that the MNP adduct resulted from trapping a carbon-centered radical located on the aromatic ring ofl-tyrosine. This same eight-line spectrum was observed when human myeloperoxidase or bovine lactoperoxidase was substituted for horseradish peroxidase. Furthermore, a partially immobilized MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adduct was detected when we exposed a synthetic polypeptide composed of glutamate and l-tyrosine residues to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system. The broadened EPR signal resulting from this MNP/polypeptide adduct was greatly narrowed by proteolytic digestion with Pronase, confirming that the initial spin-trapped radical was protein-bound. Collectively, these results indicate that peroxidases use H2O2 to convert l-tyrosine to free tyrosyl radical. They also support the idea that free tyrosyl radical initiates cross-linking of l-tyrosine residues in proteins.

Phagocytic white blood cells generate partially reduced oxygen species, which play a critical role in host defenses against invading microorganisms (1Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. CRC Crit. Rev.

This well established pathway involves a membrane-associated NADPH oxidase and the secreted heme enzyme myeloperoxidase. The oxidase converts oxygen to superoxide, which dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Myeloperoxidase then converts H2O2 into more potent microbicidal oxidants. This process has a deleterious side, however, because these reactive species can also damage host tissue at sites of inflammation. Indeed, many lines of evidence implicate phagocytes in diseases ranging from ischemia-reperfusion injury to cancer to atherosclerosis (4Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5354) Google Scholar). A high level of LDL,1 the major carrier of blood cholesterol, is one important risk factor for atherosclerosis (5Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that this lipoprotein must be oxidized to mimic the events that contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease (6Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar, 7Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J.

Moreover, oxidized LDL is present in animal and human atherosclerotic vascular lesions (9Yla-Herttuala S. Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J.

Invest. 1998; 89: 1885-1891Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The pathways that promote LDL oxidation in vivo, however, have not yet been identified (14Heinecke J.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). One mechanism may involve myeloperoxidase, which is active in human atherosclerotic tissue (15Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies reveal that the enzyme co-localizes in part with lipid-laden macrophages, the cellular hallmark of the early atherosclerotic lesion (15Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Myeloperoxidase cannot directly oxidize large molecules such as LDL because its active site is buried in a hydrophobic cleft (1Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 271-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2Klebanoff S.J. Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Function and Clinical Disorders.

Instead, it relies on low molecular weight intermediates to convey oxidizing equivalents from its heme group to its target. One of these potential oxidizing intermediates is derived froml-tyrosine, a phenolic amino acid (16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 17Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When LDL is exposed to myeloperoxidase, H2O2, andl-tyrosine, its lipids are peroxidized (18Savenkova M.I. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20394-20400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and itsl-tyrosine residues are cross-linked intoo, o′-dityrosine residues (16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We recently detected a remarkable 100-fold greater concentration of o, o′-dityrosine in LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic tissue than in circulating LDL (19Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that myeloperoxidase converts l-tyrosine to a freely diffusible, low molecular weight oxidizing intermediate in vivo and that this reactive species plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. The oxidizing intermediate derived from l-tyrosine has not yet been identified. In vitro studies suggest that it may be tyrosyl radical, because the reactions of myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and l-tyrosine show a striking resemblance to those of the phenoxyl radical (16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 17Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the myeloperoxidase system generates a spectrum of stable products (o, o′-dityrosine, trityrosine, pulcherosine, and isodityrosine) that could result from radical-radical coupling at the predominant sites of electron density on the oxygen and aromatic carbons (20Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A second possibility is that the coupling reaction could proceed through an ionic mechanism, generating a reactive cation. These two potential mechanisms are outlined in Scheme FS1. Pathway A is an ionic mechanism involving an initial two-electron oxidation of l-tyrosine. Through an electrophilic reaction, the resulting π-cation attacks a second molecule of l-tyrosine to generateo, o′-dityrosine. Pathway B is a radical mechanism involving a one-electron oxidation. Two tyrosyl radicals then combine to form o, o′-dityrosine. We now report direct evidence using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy that myeloperoxidase and other peroxidases generate free tyrosyl radical from l-tyrosine, strongly suggesting that o, o′-dityrosine forms via a radical mechanism, pathway B. We have also shown that this radical serves as a diffusible catalyst that cross-links tyrosyl residues in proteins. These observations have important implications for the mechanism of o, o′-dityrosine formation in vivo. Our results also indicate that free tyrosyl radical might be an agent of damage at sites of inflammation. Horseradish peroxidase, H2O2, lactoperoxidase, 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP), catalase, 3-aminotriazole, l-tyrosine, and the synthetic, random sequence polypeptide E-Y (glutamate/tyrosine; 4:1, mol/mol; catalog no. P0275) were obtained from Sigma. Human myeloperoxidase was provided by Dr. William M. Nauseef (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) supplied uniformly ring-labeledl-[13C6]tyrosine. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed that the isotopic purity of the compound was >98%. All reactions were performed at room temperature in Buffer A (50 mmNa2HPO4, 100 μmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 8). Phosphate buffer was treated with Chelex 100 analytical grade resin (Bio-Rad); diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was then added to chelate residual redox active metals (21Britigan B.E. Rosen G.M. Chai Y. Cohen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4426-4431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Bruker model ESP 300 EPR spectrometer equipped with a TM110 cavity. Instrument settings were as follows: receiver gain, 2.5 × 105; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.056 G; sweep rate, 1.9 G/s; and response time, 0.6 s. Spin trapping experiments used MNP, a nitroso compound that effectively reacts with carbon-centered radicals (22Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). MNP was dissolved in Buffer A in the dark to a concentration of 20 mm. It is important to note that MNP solutions have an inherent three-line background spectra (a N = 16.87 G) due to the light-induced formation of the MNP-derived spin adduct, di-tert-butylnitroxide (22Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). To minimize formation of these artifactual EPR signals, MNP solutions were kept in foil-covered tubes, and room lights were kept to a minimum. Solid l-tyrosine orl-[13C6]tyrosine was dissolved in the MNP solution to a final concentration of 2 mm. For detection of free tyrosyl radical, an aqueous flow cell was used in the EPR spectrometer. Solutions were infused at a rate of 2 ml/min using a Harvard double syringe infusion pump (model 944). One syringe (50 ml) contained horseradish peroxidase (3 mg/ml in Buffer A), and the other (50 ml) contained H2O2 (3 mmin Buffer A). Both buffers contained 2 mm l-tyrosine, yielding a final concentration in the flow cell of 1.5 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase, 1.5 mmH2O2, and 2 mm l-tyrosine. The EPR spectrometer was set to acquire and signal average for 45 scans (41 s/60-G scan). A synthetic polypeptide containing glutamic acid andl-tyrosine in a 4:1 (mol/mol) ratio, (E-Y, molecular mass 20,000–50,000 Da) was dissolved in Buffer A containing 20 mm MNP and then exposed to either the myeloperoxidase- or horseradish peroxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system described above. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, samples were subjected to EPR analysis. Concurrent with this EPR analysis, a portion of the reaction mixture was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a DG10 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Buffer A. This step removes any low molecular mass (<10,000 Da) components, including free l-tyrosine, MNP, H2O2, and free MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adducts. The eluate, containing peroxidase, polypeptide E-Y, and MNP/tyrosyl radical adducts on polypeptide E-Y, was subjected to EPR analysis. The formation of a faint brown color in the complete systems, probably due to o, o′-dityrosine formation, facilitated identification of the fractions containing high molecular weight components. A portion of this eluate was treated with Pronase (1 mg/ml; Calbiochem) for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently analyzed by EPR. In the presence of H2O2, myeloperoxidase can oxidizel-tyrosine, leading to the formation of o, o′-dityrosine (17Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a reaction that might proceed through either a free tyrosyl radical or an ionic intermediate (Scheme FS1). To determine whether tyrosyl radical might play a role in o, o′-dityrosine generation by this system, we used an EPR spin trapping system containing the nitroso spin trap MNP. MNP solutions typically demonstrate a small three-line background spectra (a N = 16.9 G) due to the light-induced formation of di-tert-butylnitroxide (Fig. 1 A) (22Buettner G.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1987; 3: 259-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). Exposure ofl-tyrosine to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2 system in the presence of MNP yielded the larger, narrower (a N = 15.6) three-line spectrum, consistent with formation of the MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adduct (Fig. 1 B). Removal of eitherl-tyrosine (Fig. 1 C) or H2O2 (Fig. 1 D) from the system led to spectra showing only the background di-tert-butylnitroxide signal, demonstrating the requirement for these factors in formation of the MNP spin adduct. Inclusion of the myeloperoxidase inhibitor azide (2 mm) also prevented tyrosyl radical formation (Fig. 1 E), illustrating the requirement for active peroxidase in this process. Importantly, the addition of 150 mm NaCl did not appreciably decrease the MNP/tyrosyl radical signal observed, suggesting that myeloperoxidase can form tyrosyl radical in the presence of physiological levels of chloride ion (a known substrate for myeloperoxidase). These EPR spin trapping studies demonstrate that myeloperoxidase is capable of oxidizing tyrosine to tyrosyl radical by a process dependent on H2O2 and active peroxidase. To provide further evidence that peroxidases generate free tyrosyl radical, we repeated the spin trapping experiments outlined above with horseradish peroxidase. The horseradish peroxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine-MNP system yielded the same three-line MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adduct as the myeloperoxidase system (Fig. 2 A). As before, the removal of peroxidase (Fig. 2 B) or H2O2 (Fig. 2 C) left only the MNP background signal. Interestingly, whenl-tyrosine was removed from this system, the resulting spectrum lacked the di-tert-butylnitroxide background spectrum (Fig. 2 D), suggesting that this species is unstable in the horseradish peroxidase-H2O2 system. Again, the di-tert-butylnitroxide background spectrum could be seen when azide was included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2 E). These experiments demonstrate that the horseradish peroxidase-H2O2 system can also lead tol-tyrosine oxidation and formation of MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adducts. Substitution of 13C ring-labeled l-tyrosine forl-tyrosine provides confirmation that the species responsible for the EPR spectrum generated by myeloperoxidase was tyrosyl radical, because 13C has a spin of ½ compared with the 12C spin of 0. Fig. 3 A represents the same three-line MNP/tyrosyl radical spectra seen above with the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system. When l-[13C6]tyrosine was added to this system in place of nonisotopically labeledl-tyrosine, a distinct eight-line spectrum was observed (Fig. 3 B). The resulting spectrum for the MNP/[13C6]tyrosyl radical adduct (a N = 15.6 G, a13 C (2Klebanoff S.J. Clark R.A. The Neutrophil: Function and Clinical Disorders. Elsevier/North Holland Biomedical Press, New York1978Google Scholar) = 8.0 G, a13 C (1Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 271-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) = 7.1 G, a13 C (1Hurst J.K. Barrette Jr., W.C. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1989; 24: 271-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) = 1.3 G) was clearly different from that seen with the same system in the presence of nonisotopic l-tyrosine. This eight-line spectrum was also seen when lactoperoxidase or horseradish peroxidase replaced myeloperoxidase in the presence ofl-[13C6]tyrosine (Fig. 3,C and D). As with myeloperoxidase, these eight-line spectra were not seen ifl-[13C6]tyrosine or H2O2 were omitted from the reaction mixture (data not shown). The experiments withl-[13C6]tyrosine provide strong evidence that the product of l-tyrosine oxidation by a peroxidase/H2O2 system is tyrosyl radical. Chemical oxidation ofl-tyrosine to tyrosyl radical has previously been demonstrated using a flow injection system and EPR (23Sealy R.C. Harman L. West P.R. Mason R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3401-3406Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We used this same experimental approach to demonstrate that a peroxidase-H2O2 system converts free tyrosine into tyrosyl radical (Fig. 4 A). In these experiments, no spin trap is added, and the resulting signal is representative of free tyrosyl radical. Horseradish peroxidase was employed for these studies because it is available in large quantities. Generation of tyrosyl radical required all of the components of the complete horseradish peroxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system; no EPR spectrum was observed when l-tyrosine (Fig. 4 B), horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 4 C), or H2O2 (data not shown) was omitted. To confirm the identity of the enzymatically generated radical species, we oxidized l-tyrosine chemically with KMnO4. The resulting signal (Fig. 1 D) was virtually identical to that generated by the horseradish peroxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system. Computer simulation of the enzymatically generated tyrosyl radical yielded EPR splitting constants of a 2,6 H = 6.3 G,a 3,5 H = 1.6 G, and a β H = 15.0 G (Fig. 4 E), consistent with those previously reported for the chemically oxidized free tyrosyl radical (23Sealy R.C. Harman L. West P.R. Mason R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3401-3406Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the assignment of 15.3 G to the β-hydrogens at C-7 assumes equivalency for these nonidentical protons. Line broadening at ambient temperatures yields the apparent coupling value (15.3 G), which is actually the sum of the couplings of these nonidentical protons (23Sealy R.C. Harman L. West P.R. Mason R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3401-3406Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results provide direct evidence for the peroxidase-dependent formation of freely diffusible tyrosyl radical. Previous studies have demonstrated that o, o′-dityrosine cross-linking of proteins by myeloperoxidase requires active enzyme, H2O2, and free l-tyrosine (16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The requirement for free l-tyrosine in proteino, o′-dityrosine cross-linking suggests that a low molecular weight oxidizing species produced by myeloperoxidase froml-tyrosine might be acting as a diffusible radical catalyst. This diffusible species could then react with tyrosine residues on proteins, generating protein-bound tyrosyl radicals that would form o, o′-dityrosine cross-links. Our results demonstrating that various peroxidases convert freel-tyrosine into tyrosyl radical implicate this reactive intermediate as the diffusible oxidant produced by myeloperoxidase. To investigate whether free tyrosyl radical generated by myeloperoxidase and H2O2 could react with protein to yield protein-bound tyrosyl radical, we exposed a synthetic polypeptide containing glutamate and l-tyrosine (E-Y polypeptide, molecular mass 20,000–50,000 Da) to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system in the presence of MNP. When this sample was subjected to EPR analysis, we observed an isotropic three-line spectrum, consistent with formation of free MNP/tyrosyl radical (Fig. 5 A), with slightly broadened peaks and a shoulder on the high field peak between 3480 and 3485 Gauss. This is consistent with a fraction of the MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adducts being unable to rotate freely, suggesting that these adducts were bound to the E-Y polypeptide. To determine whether MNP spin adducts were present on the E-Y polypeptide, the reaction mixture was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. EPR analysis of the fraction containing the reisolated polypeptide yielded a spectrum characteristic of an immobilized nitroxide (Fig. 5 B). Note that the spectrum in Fig. 5 A and the dominant three-line spectrum seen in Fig. 5 B exhibit the same g values and hyperfine splitting constants; however, the high field peak in the spectrum of the fraction following size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 5 B) was markedly broadened compared with that of the complete reaction mixture (Fig. 5 A). Formation of the immobilized MNP polypeptide adducts required the presence of free tyrosine as well as MNP, active enzyme, H2O2, and polypeptide (data not shown). To provide further evidence that the immobilized nitroxide adduct was formed on tyrosine residues of the E-Y polypeptide, the high molecular weight fraction containing the reisolated peptide was subjected to nonspecific proteolysis with Pronase, and the digest was subjected to EPR analysis. The resulting EPR signal of the Pronase-treated sample (Fig. 5 C) was nearly isotropic and similar to that of the myeloperoxidase-MNP/l-tyrosine-H2O2-E-Y polypeptide system (Fig. 5 A). These findings strongly suggest that MNP/tyrosyl spin adducts are formed with tyrosine residues in the E-Y polypeptide. The requirement for free tyrosine implies that tyrosyl radical generated by myeloperoxidase is catalyzing the formation of tyrosyl radical on the polypeptide. We also determined whether horseradish peroxidase would form tyrosyl radical on the E-Y polypeptide. As with myeloperoxidase, EPR analysis of the complete horseradish peroxidase-MNP/l-tyrosine-H2O2-E-Y polypeptide system revealed the formation of a slightly broadened three-line spectrum (Fig. 6 A). EPR analysis of polypeptide E-Y isolated by size exclusion chromatography again showed the immobilized nitroxide spectrum (Fig. 6 B). Treatment of the polypeptide with Pronase yielded a nearly isotropic three-line spectrum (Fig. 6 C). Previous studies have shown that horseradish peroxidase will directly oxidize protein-bound tyrosyl residues too, o′-dityrosine. Consistent with these observations, horseradish peroxidase also generated MNP/tyrosyl radical spin adducts on polypeptide E-Y in the absence of free tyrosine (data not shown). Immobilized MNP adducts were also observed when horseradish peroxidase was incubated together with H2O2 and MNP alone, strongly suggesting that MNP/tyrosyl radical adducts were formed on the peroxidase itself. In contrast, MNP/tyrosyl radical adducts were undetectable in the myeloperoxidase system when freel-tyrosine was omitted from the reaction mixture, implying that the nitroxide spin adduct was generated on the synthetic polypeptide by a reaction that required free tyrosine and active peroxidase. In the present report, we provide direct evidence that myeloperoxidase, lactoperoxidase, and horseradish peroxidase use H2O2 to convert free l-tyrosine into tyrosyl radical, a diffusible species that can react with tyrosine residues on proteins and lead to proteino, o′-dityrosine cross-linking. The spin trapping reagent MNP reacted with radical intermediates generated by each of the peroxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine systems to yield a spin adduct, demonstrating a characteristic isotropic three-line EPR spectrum. Generation of the EPR spectrum by peroxidase required free l-tyrosine, suggesting that free tyrosyl radical was being generated. The myeloperoxidase-dependent reaction was not inhibited by plasma levels of NaCl, an alternative substrate for oxidation by the enzyme, suggesting that myeloperoxidase may promote the formation of tyrosyl radical in vivo. To further demonstrate that myeloperoxidase and the other peroxidases generate tyrosyl radical, we examined the EPR spectrum of ring-labeledl-[13C6]tyrosine oxidized by the different enzymes. When ring-labeledl-[13C6]tyrosine was substituted for l-tyrosine in each of the peroxidase-H2O2-MNP systems, an eight-line spectrum replaced the three-line spectrum. The appearance of additional hyperfine splitting in the EPR spectrum of the MNP spin adduct indicates that the radical site is located on the aromatic ring ofl-tyrosine, strongly suggesting that free tyrosyl radical is generated by myeloperoxidase and the other enzymes. EPR spectroscopy using a flow cell provided direct evidence of free tyrosyl radical formation by the horseradish peroxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system. Formation of tyrosyl radical required each of the components of the reaction system and was not observed when horseradish peroxidase, H2O2, or l-tyrosine was omitted from the reaction mixture. The EPR spectrum generated by enzymatic oxidation of l-tyrosine by peroxidase was essentially identical to that generated by direct one-electron oxidation ofl-tyrosine by KMnO4 (23Sealy R.C. Harman L. West P.R. Mason R.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3401-3406Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, a computer simulation using splitting constants of a 2,6 H = 6.3 G,a 3,5 H = 1.6 G,a β H = 15.0 G yielded a spectrum that was essentially identical to that seen with the enzymatic system. These results provide unambiguous evidence that horseradish peroxidase converts free l-tyrosine to tyrosyl radical by a reaction requiring H2O2. Previous studies indicate that human phagocytes use myeloperoxidase and H2O2 to convert l-tyrosine into a family of l-tyrosine oxidation products, includingo, o′-dityrosine, pulcherosine, isodityrosine, and trityrosine (17Heinecke J.W.

Oxidizing intermediates generated in these reactions also generate o, o′-dityrosine cross-links in proteins and stimulate the peroxidation of LDL lipids (16Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A.

A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Crystallographic studies of myeloperoxidase indicate that the heme group of the enzyme is located deep within the enzyme’s core (3Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the results of the current studies, suggest that myeloperoxidase acts on tyrosine residues of proteins and LDL lipids by converting free l-tyrosine into tyrosyl radical, which serves as a freely diffusible, low molecular weight radical catalyst. This species then attacks protein tyrosine residues, converting them to tyrosyl radical. Additional reactions lead to o, o′-dityrosine formation or proteino, o′-dityrosine cross-linking. To test this hypothesis, we exposed an l-tyrosine-rich, synthetic polypeptide to either myeloperoxidase or horseradish peroxidase in the presence of H2O2,l-tyrosine, and the spin trap MNP. Following isolation of the polypeptide by size exclusion chromatography, the three-line MNP/tyrosyl radical spectrum was greatly broadened, suggesting formation of an immobilized adduct. This observation suggested that tyrosine residues on the polypeptide had been oxidized to tyrosyl radicals that subsequently reacted with MNP. This hypothesis was strongly supported by the demonstration that the broadened, nonisotropic three-line spectrum became nearly isotropic after the polypeptide was digested to low molecular weight peptides and free amino acids with a nonspecific protease. Protein o, o′-dityrosine cross-linking is commonly found in cell wall proteins that are modified after translation, as in bacterial and plant cell walls, yeast spore coats (25Briza P. Winkler H. Kalchhauser H. Breitenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4288-4294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the fertilization envelope of sea urchin embryos (26Foerder C.A. Schapiro B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In all cases where the biochemical mechanism is known, the reaction involves a heme protein and takes place in the absence of free tyrosine. High concentrations of horseradish peroxidase and H2O2 form o, o′-dityrosine cross-links in proteins in vitro (27Amado R. Aeschbach R. Neukom H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Also, protein-bound tyrosyl radical has been detected by EPR spin trapping in cytochromec exposed to H2O2 (28Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the mechanism involves the direct oxidation of protein-bound l-tyrosine residues by a heme protein. In contrast, myeloperoxidase requires freel-tyrosine to generateo, o′-dityrosine in proteins, implying that a species derived from l-tyrosine is the actual oxidizing intermediate. Our results strongly implicate tyrosyl radical as the reactive species. Although this study suggests that coupling of tyrosyl radicals generates o, o′-dityrosine, the reaction pathway that generates tyrosyl radical is not yet established. The mechanism could involve hydrogen atom abstraction from l-tyrosine, or it could be a one-electron oxidation of the phenolate anion (Scheme FS2). The latter may be kinetically favored, because alkaline pH is optimal for the formation of o, o′-dityrosine by horseradish peroxidase and myeloperoxidase (17Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These conditions favor loss of a proton from the hydroxyl group, as would happen in a one-electron oxidation of the phenolate anion.

One involves a radical-radical recombination reaction between two tyrosyl radicals, generating o, o′-dityrosine, isodityrosine, and other products. 2tyrosylradicals→o,o′­Dityrosine+otherproducts REACTION 3 Tyrosyl radical might also attack other readily oxidized substrates like vitamin E and polyunsaturated fatty acids, initiating lipid peroxidation (18Savenkova M.I.

Tyrosylradical+vitaminE⇔L­Tyrosine+tocopherylradical REACTION 4 Alternatively, it might exchange a hydrogen atom or electron with protein-bound l-tyrosine, forming protein-bound tyrosyl radical and regenerating l-tyrosine (16Heinecke J.W.

Tyrosylradical+protein­tyrosine⇔ L­Tyrosine+protein­tyrosylradical REACTION 5 Our detection of MNP bound to the synthetic polypeptide strongly supports this hypothesis and further suggests that tyrosyl radical is the true intermediate in the reaction. The protein-bound tyrosyl radical might then react with free tyrosyl radical or a second protein-bound tyrosyl radical to generate a protein-boundo, o′-dityrosine cross-link. Experiments with radiolabeled free l-tyrosine suggest that the predominant reaction involves free tyrosyl radical in solution (24Francis G.A. Mendez A.J. Bierman E.L. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6631-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Protein­tyrosylradical+tyrosylradical →Proteino,o′­dityrosinecross­links REACTION 6 The direct demonstration that peroxidases generate free tyrosyl radical may have important implications for the mechanism of tissue damage by activated phagocytes at sites of inflammation. Myeloperoxidase is present in atherosclerotic lesions, a chronic inflammatory condition (15Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Protein-bound levels of o, o′-dityrosine are greatly elevated in atherosclerotic tissue and in LDL isolated from such lesions (19Leeuwenburgh C. Rasmussen J.E. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Pennathur S. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3520-3526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, l-tyrosine may be an important substrate for myeloperoxidase. The resulting tyrosyl radical may render LDL atherogenic by peroxidizing its lipids and cross-linking its proteins. This connection between myeloperoxidase and l-tyrosine oxidation raises the possibility that the enzyme plays a key role in vascular tissue damage at sites of inflammation. Moreover, it is likely that heme proteins also oxidize l-tyrosine to tyrosyl radical in other biological systems. We thank Dr. L. Sage for critical reading of the manuscript and Dr. W. M. Nauseef for providing human myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2132306888,"The enzyme 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) participates in the dioxygenation of polyenoic fatty acids. This activity leads to the degradation of mitochondrial membranes during reticulocyte differentiation, the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators by a variety of cell types, and the oxidation of lipids in atherosclerotic lesions. The cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, are reported to induce the expression of 15-LO in human peripheral blood monocytes. In this report we explore the signaling mechanisms involved in the IL-13-mediated induction of 15-LO expression. First we demonstrate that the delayed induction of 15-LO requires continuous stimulation of monocytes for a minimum period of 12 h. We also found that tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocked the induction of 15-LO in a dose-dependent manner. By immunoprecipitation and antiphosphotyrosine blotting experiments, IL-13 was shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and Tyk2, but not Jak1 or Jak3, within 5 min of treatment in human monocytes. To investigate whether the early induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak2 and Tyk2 was ultimately involved in 15-LO expression, we generated antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) against Tyk2 and Jak2. We employed a cationic lipid-mediated delivery technique to transfect the monocytes and found that both antisense ODNs inhibited expression of their target proteins by 75–85%. The treatments were specific and did not affect the expression of each other. Furthermore, the antisense ODNs to Jak2 and Tyk2 both inhibited the induction of expression of 15-LO in monocytes treated with IL-13. Parallel experiments with sense ODNs to Jak2 and Tyk2 did not affect their protein levels or the induction of 15-LO by IL-13, and down-regulation of Jak1 also did not affect expression of 15-LO. Our results suggest the novel finding that IL-13 can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak2 and Tyk2 in primary human monocytes. This occurs as an early and essential signal transduction event for the IL-13-mediated induction of 15-LO expression. These data represent the first characterization of upstream kinases involved in the induced expression of 15-LO."

Importantly, in cell binding experiments, we demonstrate that this protein is a receptor for activated α2-macroglobulin.

In contrast, LRP is present in patchy regions around large neurons and most prominently in the glomeruli of the stratum granulare of the cerebellum.

The LDL1receptor gene family specifies a group of highly related composite membrane proteins engaged in receptor-mediated endocytosis of a variety of independent ligands. The members of the family are, listed in the order of their discovery, LDL receptor (LDLR), LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), gp330/megalin, VLDL receptor (or LR8), LR11, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2), and LR8B (1Schneider W.J.

Common features of these proteins are structurally and functionally distinct modules that are defined by distinct exons in the corresponding genes. These modules are (i) the type A binding repeats of ∼40 residues, each harboring 6 paired cysteines; (ii) type B repeats, also containing 6 cysteines each; (iii) modules of ∼50 residues with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD) (together with the type B repeats they constitute the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain); (iv) a short stretch containing many serines and threonines carryingO-linked sugars (in the case of LR8 this domain is 30 amino acids long and is encoded by a single exon (3Bujo H. Lindstedt K.A. Hermann M. Dalmau L.M. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23546-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)); (v) a short transmembrane domain of approximately 20 amino acids, and (vi) the cytoplasmic region with one or more signals for receptor internalization via coated pits. The structural hallmark of the members of this family is the presence of specific arrangements of exactly these domains. For example, the extracellular part of LRP, which is one of the largest members of the family, is highly complex and contains 31 type A repeats organized in four clusters of 2, 8, 10, and 11 of these repeats, respectively. These clusters are separated from each other by epidermal growth factor precursor domains. LRP is a multiligand receptor involved in a variety of independent processes such as lipoprotein metabolism and extracellular proteinase homeostasis (for review see Refs. 4Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar and 5Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The latter function is mediated by α2-macroglobulin (α2M), a multifunctional proteinase inhibitor (for review see Ref. 6Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11539-11542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2M forms complexes between a variety of proteinases that are rapidly removed from the circulation by specifically binding to hepatic LRP. The receptor binding site on α2M is exposed by a conformational change which is the result of a cleavage in the “bait region” of α2M by proteinases that subsequently become cross-linked to α2M via an internal thiolester. Because α2M also binds a broad spectrum of cytokines and growth factors, the LRP/α2M system might even function as a clearing or targeting mechanism for these cytokines (for review see Refs. 7LaMarre J.

The structure of these proteins is reminiscent of the smaller members of the family, LDLR and VLDL receptor, in that they harbor only one cluster of either 3, 4, 7, or 8 type A repeats (11Brandes C. Novak S. Stockinger W. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Genomics. 1997; 42: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Kim D.-H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C. Kim H.-J. Suzuki H. Fujita T.

The most interesting feature of apoER2 and LR7/8B is their site of expression. Whereas human apoER2 is found in brain and placenta, LR7/8B in chicken is expressed in brain only. This is in sharp contrast to other members of the LDLR family, which are all expressed to a certain extent in the brain but most prominently in a variety of other organs and cells. Lately, considerable interest has focused on LDLR, LRP, and VLDL receptors in respect to their expression in the central nervous system, because these receptors bind apoE isoforms, which are thought to play a role in the development of late onset Alzheimer’s disease (for review see Ref.14Strittmatter W.J. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4725-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Because apoER2 binds apoE-rich β-VLDL in vitro (13Kim D.-H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C.

LR7/8B is expressed in the perikaryon of all neurons throughout the brain, with a marked specificity for proximal dendrites. This localization was confirmed in cultured primary rat neurons, where the receptor was found in the cell body and dendrites. In addition, there is significant expression in the arachnoid membrane and, most notably, on the apical aspect of the epithelium of the choroid plexus. These results strongly suggest that LR7/8B is involved in the clearance of α2M·proteinase complexes or other substrates that bind to α2M from the cerebrospinal fluid and in particular from the surface of neurons.RESULTSTo characterize potential function(s) of LR7/8B, we stably expressed one of the splice variants harboring 8 ligand binding repeats (LR8B) in 293 cells. Northern and Western blot analyses show strong expression of LR8B in these cells (Figs. 1, A and B). Confocal microscopical studies of immunofluorescently stained 293 cells expressing the receptor demonstrated the presence of LR8B on the cell surface and in vesicular structures within the cell (Fig. 1 C). To functionally assess the competence of the recombinant receptor to interact with ligands, we measured LR8B-mediated binding and internalization of RAP, which has recently been shown to bind to native LR7/8B (12Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 extracts of LR8B-expressing cells were subjected to ligand blot experiments with125I-labeled RAP, and as seen in Fig. 2 A, LR8B expressed in 293 cells indeed binds RAP (lane 2), demonstrating binding competence of the recombinant receptor. The binding of125I-RAP can be competed for with an excess of unlabeled RAP but not with rabbit β-VLDL, which has been shown to bind to human apoER2 (13Kim D.-H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C.

Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight and incubated with human 125I-RAP-GST (100 μg/ml, 6 × 105cpm/mg) as described. The incubation was carried out without (lanes 1 and 2) or with addition of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled rabbit β-VLDL (lane 3) or unlabeled RAP-GST (lane 4). Blots were exposed on X-OmatTM(Kodak) for 7 h at −70 °C. B, cell association of125I-RAP in 293 cells stably transfected with the empty pCIneo vector (mock), a cDNA construct of LR8B, and a cDNA construct of LR8. Cell monolayers at a confluency of 70% were incubated with 125I-labeled RAP-GST at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (specific activity, 397 cpm/ng) for 3 h at 37 °C as described under “Materials and Methods.” After washing, the cells were lysed, the radioactivity of the lysate was determined, and the protein concentrations were measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used these cells to study RAP binding and internalization. Fig. 2 B shows the results of a representative experiment comparing LR8B- and LR8-mediated cell association at a RAP concentration of 1 μg/ml. This concentration is close to theK d of RAP binding to LR8B, which was determined in a separate experiment (data not shown). Cells expressing LR8, which is the chicken homologue of the mammalian VLDL receptor, were chosen as positive control because we have recently established RAP as ligand for this receptor (20Hiesberger T. Hermann M. Jacobsen L. Novak S. Hodits R.A. Bujo H. Meilinger M. Hüttinger M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18219-18226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected cells bind and internalize, possibly via low levels of endogenously expressed LRP, measurable amounts of RAP (24 ng of RAP/mg of cell protein/h). However, cells expressing LR8B bind and internalize ∼2.5 times the amount of RAP (60 ng of RAP/mg of cell protein/h) than mock-transfected cells. In comparison, LR8-mediated RAP binding and uptake amounts to 82 ng of RAP/mg of cell protein/h.The fact that α2M not only binds to LRP but also to LR8, which mediates vitellogenesis in egg-laying species and harbors eight ligand binding repeats just like LR8B (23Jacobsen L. Hermann M. Vieira P.M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6468-6475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), prompted us to test the possibility that LR8B might be a receptor for activated α2M (α2M*) in brain. As shown in Fig. 3 A, LR8B-expressing cells bind and internalize α2M* with a K d of 76 nm. This binding is specific because it is reduced to background levels by a 40-fold molar excess of RAP. Mock-transfected 293 cells bind small amounts (6 times less than LR8B-expressing cells) of α2M* with a K d of 41 nm. This binding is also inhibited by RAP and is most likely mediated by low endogenous levels of LRP in these cells (see above, RAP binding). Most significantly, as evaluated with a mutant CHO cell line expressing recombinant chicken LRP (19Avramoglu R.K. Nimpf J. McLeod R.S. Ko K.W.S. Wang Y. FitzGerald D. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6057-6065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the binding affinities of α2M* for LR8B and LRP, the prototype α2M* receptor, are similar (76 versus 30 nm) (Fig. 3 B). Specific binding of α2M* to mock-transfected cells was absent, because CHO-K1 do not express endogenous LRP (19Avramoglu R.K. Nimpf J. McLeod R.S. Ko K.W.S. Wang Y. FitzGerald D. Yao Z. J. Biol.

A, binding and uptake (cell associated activity) of 125I-α2M* by cells incubated in the presence of a 40-fold molar excess of GST-RAP was subtracted from that measured without competitor, and Scatchard analysis was performed (bound/free (b/f) against bound (b)) (inset).

We prepared antibodies against the entire cytosolic domain of chicken LR7/8B (12Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) produced in Escherichia coli as GST fusion protein. To compare expression of LR7/8B with the expression of LRP, an antibody against purified chicken LRP-515 was prepared. Fig. 4 shows a Western blot characterizing both new antibodies. As expected, anti-LR7/8B detects the antigen in a crude chicken brain membrane extract (lane 3); as control we used recombinant LR8B expressed in 293 cells (lane 1). Most importantly, this antibody does not cross-react with LRP in brain (lane 3) and liver (lane 4). Anti-LRP also fulfills the criteria needed in this study, in that it is specific for LRP and does not cross-react with LR7/8B, as demonstrated with transfected 293 cells (lane 7, 10 times as much protein loaded as in lane 1).Figure 4Analysis of specificity of anti-LR7/8B and anti-LRP515 antibodies. Triton X-100 membrane extracts from liver and total brain and extracts from 293 cells were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods” and subjected to electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions on a 4.5–18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane.Lane 1, 0.3 μg of 293-LR8B extract; lane 2, 3 μg of 293-pCIneo mock extract; lanes 3 and 6, 50 μg of chicken brain membrane extract; lanes 4 and 5, 50 μg of rooster liver membrane extract; lane 7, 3 μg of 293-LR8B extract. Lanes 1–4 were incubated with anti LR7/8B (20 μg/ml), and lanes 5-7 were incubated with anti LRP515 (20 μg/ml). Bound IgG was visualized with protein A-horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/ml) and a chemiluminescence system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5 displays an overview of sites and cells in chicken brain expressing LR7/8B. Representative for all regions of the brain, large neurons of the brain stem are prominently stained by anti-LR7/8B (Fig. 5 A). Inspection of other regions of the brain revealed a hierarchy among neurons based on the expression of the receptor. Large neurons express significantly more of the receptor than small neurons. Glial cells, however, do not show any detectable expression. Another site of massive expression of LR7/8B is the epithelium of the choroid plexus (Fig. 5 B). This cuboidal cell layer surrounds a capillary network producing most of the cerebrospinal fluid. Because the ependymal layer of the ventricles shows only very little or no staining, there is a clear demarcation between these cells and the epithelium of the choroid plexus marked by the expression of LR7/8B (arrow in Fig. 5 B). However, along the lateral wall and especially on the bottom of the third ventricle some ependymal cells were stained (arrow in Fig. 5 C). Another cell layer in close contact with the cerebrospinal fluid is the arachnoid membrane, which together with the pia mater and dura mater forms the three meningeal layers covering the brain. In addition to the wall of capillaries present in the subarachnoid space, strong immunoreactivity can be seen in the arachnoid membrane (Fig. 5 D). The staining of the vessel wall seen in Fig. 5 D is not specific for the subarachnoid space but is present in all blood vessels in the brain (Fig. 5 E). Both the endothelium and the media of the blood vessels express LR7/8B. The major site of expression in the cerebellum are the Purkinje cells, which are arranged side by side in a single layer separating the molecular layer from the granular layer (Fig. 5 F). As already clearly visible at this magnification, the staining extends into the proximal dendrites of the Purkinje cells, which continue into the molecular layer of the cerebellum. To control for the results presented in Fig. 5, we used the cerebellum again and performed the same experiment without the primary antibody and without hematoxylin for nuclear stain. As seen in Fig. 5 G, staining of the Purkinje cells depends upon the presence of anti-LR7/8B antibody. When the immunostaining procedure was carried out in the presence of an excess of the GST fusion protein used for the production of the antibody, staining at all sites of expression was strongly reduced (data not shown). Furthermore, in situ hybridization experiments using antisense (Fig. 5 H) and sense (Fig. 5 I) RNA probes specific for LR7/8B confirm the expression data obtained by cytohistochemistry.Figure 5Immunohistochemical analysis of LR7/8B expression in chicken brain. Immunohistochemistry (A toG) was performed on sagittal sections of a brain from a laying hen as described under “Material and Methods” using anti-LR7/8B antibody (expressed LR7/8B appears in red).

The most significant differences in the expression of these proteins are shown in Fig. 6 and relate to large neurons, Purkinje cells, and the choroid plexus. As seen in Fig. 6,A.1 and A.2, anti LR7/8B antibody produces a distinct punctate signal close to the cell membrane in large neurons of the brain stem and Purkinje cells, which is compatible with the staining of endocytic vesicles. Significantly, the signal obtained with anti-LRP antibody in the same area of the brain stem as seen in Fig. 6 A.1 is clearly different from that obtained with anti-LR7/8B. It outlines the cell membrane of the neurons without exhibiting a punctate staining within the cells (Fig. 6 B.1). Most significantly, areas surrounding the cell bodies of the neurons (arrows) exhibit prominent staining. RAP however, which is an ER-resident protein and interacts with both receptors (12Novak S. Hiesberger T. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11732-11736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), is expressed in all neurons and their dendrites (Fig. 6 C.1).Figure 6Immunohistochemical analysis of LR7/8B, LRP, and RAP expression in chicken brain. Immunohistochemistry was performed on sagittal sections of a brain from a laying hen as described under “Material and Methods” using anti-LR7/8B antibody (A.1 to A.3), anti-LRP antibody (B.1to B.3), and anti-RAP antibody (C.1 toC.3).

C.3, choroid plexus with nonpolar staining of the epithelial layer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As mentioned above, anti-LR7/8B antibody also stains dendrites extending from the Purkinje cells into the stratum moleculare of the cerebellum (Fig. 6 A.2). In sharp contrast to RAP (Fig. 6 C.2), which is expressed throughout the dendritic trees of the Purkinje cells, expression of LR7/8B seems to be restricted to the proximal part of the dendrites. The molecular layer and the granular layer do not show any significant expression of LR7/8B. Again, the anti-LRP antibody produces a completely different pattern in the cerebellum (Fig. 6 B.2). Expression of LRP within the Purkinje cells is much weaker than that of LR7/8B and RAP. The most intense staining with anti-LRP antibody can be seen in distinct areas of the granular layer. As evidenced by the nuclear staining with hematoxylin, these areas correspond to cerebellar glomeruli, acellular spaces within the granular layer, which is densely packed with small neurons (granule cells). Within glomeruli, these cells form complex synaptic contacts with the bulbous expansions of afferent fibers. Together with the intense staining surrounding large neurons, this pattern suggests that LRP is strongly expressed in synaptic regions of the brain.Finally, we have studied the expression of LR7/8B, LRP, and RAP in the choroid plexus. As seen in Fig. 6 A.3, expression of LR7/8B is restricted to the apical side of the epithelial cells. In sharp contrast, LRP is also found on the baso-lateral side of these cells (Fig. 6 B.3), whereas RAP is uniformly distributed in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (Fig. 6 C.3).To confirm the neuronal and dendritic staining seen in the cytohistochemical studies with anti-LR7/8B, we cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons (26Bartlett W.P. Banker G.A. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 1944-1953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and stained these cells with anti-LR7/8B. Neurons cultured for 18 days, which are characterized by fully developed dendrites, show an intense staining of the cell body and dendrites (Fig. 7 A). Obviously, the signal elicited by the antibody extends to the very ends of the dendrites without loosing intensity, suggesting a uniform expression of the receptor over the whole length of the outgrowing dendrites. This staining is specific, because control experiments without the first antibody completely abolished the signal (Fig. 7 B). LR7/8B is already expressed to a similar extent in the cell body and outgrowing dendrites at day 11 when dendrites become first visible (data not shown). Double immunostaining of these cells with anti-LR7/8B and anti-MAP 2, a dendritic marker (28Tucker R.P. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 1990; 15: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), in conjunction with confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are indeed colocalized in dendrites (Fig. 7 C). Moreover, accentuation of immunoreactivity on the surface of dendrites (Fig. 7 A) indicates expression on the"

C., Carey, D. J., and Brandan, E. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18418–18424). We examined the role of syndecan-1 in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. C2C12 myoblasts were stably transfected with an expression plasmid containing the rat syndecan-1 coding region cDNA. Constitutive syndecan-1 expression resulted in a strongly diminished capacity of the transfected clones to differentiate and to express skeletal muscle-specific markers such as fusion, creatine kinase, and myosin. The expression of myogenin, a master transcription factor for muscle differentiation, was also reduced and delayed. Analysis of the induction of a myogenin promoter-driven reporter revealed that syndecan-1 expression resulted in a 6–7-fold increase in sensitivity to bFGF-dependent inhibition of myogenin expression. Transfecting the cells with a plasmid containing myogenin cDNA reversed the inhibition of myogenin transcriptional activation and myosin expression in syndecan-1-transfected cells; however, cell fusion was not observed. These results demonstrate that syndecan-1 expression enhances cell responsiveness to bFGF and inhibits myoblast fusion and suggest that muscle terminal differentiation is regulated by syndecan-1 expression.

The process of myogenic development involves an ordered sequence of molecular events that includes commitment of muscle precursor cells, cessation of cell division, myoblast terminal differentiation, and formation of myotubes that express muscle-specific genes involved in the specialized functions of the myofiber (1Yun K. Wold B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). These processes are governed by a network of muscle regulatory factors (2Rawls A. Olson E.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One of the factors responsible for the induction of terminal differentiation is myogenin, a transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix family that activates skeletal muscle-specific products such as creatine kinase, myosin heavy chain, acetylcholine receptor, etc. (3Ludolph D.C. Konieczny S.F. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The onset and progression of this process are controlled by a complex set of interactions between myoblasts and their environment. The presence of the extracellular matrix (ECM)1 is essential for normal myogenesis (4Hauschka S.D. Konigsberg I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 5Melo F. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Saitoh O. Periasamy M. Kan M. Matsuda R. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The involvement of growth factors in the regulation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation is well established in vitro, as well as the modulation of their activities by interaction with ECM constituents such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans. The ability of myoblasts to differentiate is controlled in a negative manner by the extracellular concentration of specific mitogens, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), and transforming growth factor type-β (7Brunetti A.

Med. Biol. 1993; 343: 319-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the inhibitory growth factors, myoblasts continue to proliferate and fail to fuse or to express muscle-specific gene products. Conversely, in cell culture experiments the reduction in the concentration of these growth factors below a critical level results in irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle and terminal differentiation. It has been demonstrated that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are necessary for the modulation of terminal myogenesis (12Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B.

Cell Res. 1997; 234: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that the expression of syndecan-1, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (20Bernfield M.

Syndecan-1 mRNA as well as cell-surface syndecan-1 disappear almost completely by 48 h after triggering differentiation (22Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18418-18424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell-surface heparan sulfate molecules are critical in the activation of signaling receptors by growth factors (23Johnson G.R. Wong L. J. Biol.

It has been shown that, depending on the cellular localization, syndecans can either increase or decrease responsiveness to bFGF. Syndecans potentiate bFGF binding to the signaling receptor when they are associated with the membrane but inhibit bFGF receptor binding when added in soluble form (25Steinfeld R. Van Den Berghe H. David G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Overexpression of syndecan-1 in a cell line in which most of the expressed proteoglycan is shed from the membrane also leads to decreased responsiveness to bFGF (26Mali M. Elenius K. Miettinen H.M. Jalkanen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24215-24222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The potential to regulate growth factor activity by means of heparan sulfate-dependent interactions provides an attractive system for fine-tuning cellular responses to growth factors in the extracellular environment. Because its potential to act as a growth factor co-receptor (14Aviezer D. Levy E. Safran M. Svahn C. Buddecke E. Schmidt A. David G. Vlodavsky I. Yayon A. J. Biol.

To investigate the role of syndecan-1 during skeletal muscle terminal differentiation, we transfected C2C12 myoblasts with expression plasmids containing rat syndecan-1 cDNA. Constitutive expression of syndecan-1 resulted in a strongly diminished capacity of the transfected myoblasts to differentiate, and a 6-7-fold increase in sensitivity to bFGF-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. Thus the sensitivity of myoblasts to bFGF, an inhibitor of myogenesis, is directly modulated by syndecan-1 expression.

S&S Nytran Plus membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. The mouse skeletal muscle cell line C2C12 was grown as described (22Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Brandan E.

Three days after plating in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.05% CEE), differentiation was triggered by changing the medium to differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum). Two days later, 0.1 mm cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside was added to the culture medium. Thereafter the incubation medium was changed daily. In some experiments sodium chlorate (final concentration 50 mm) was added to the cultures at the time of plating and maintained during differentiation. Heparin (final concentration 0–1 mg/ml) was added to differentiation medium containing 5 ng/ml bFGF. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using Trizol. RNA samples (15 μg/lane) were electrophoresed through 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran membranes, and hybridized with probes for myogenin and syndecan-1 as described previously (22Larrain J.

Blots were hybridized with random primed labeled probes in a buffer containing 1.0m NaCl, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testes DNA at 65 °C overnight. Hybridized membranes were washed twice at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. For quantitative determination of the mRNA levels, the intensity of the hybridization signals was measured by densitometric scanning (GS 300 Scanning Densitometer, Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). C2C12 cells were plated at a density of 6,000 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes in growth medium. 24 h later the cells were transfected with the mammalian expression plasmid pCMVneo containing a 1-kb cDNA insert coding for full-length rat syndecan-1 in the sense orientation (29Cizmeci-Smith G.

Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with pCMVneo containing no insert. For transfections, 40 μg of plasmid DNA and 30 μg of LipofectAMINE in a total volume of 600 μl of Opti-MEM I were mixed in a glass tube and allowed to sit for 30 min. During this period the cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM I and maintained in this medium. The DNA mixture was added dropwise with swirling to C2C12cultures. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h with this mixture. FCS and CEE were then added to final concentrations of 10 and 0.5%, and the cells were incubated overnight in this medium. Finally the cells were rinsed twice with HBSS and cultured in normal growth medium. After 3 days the cells were switched to normal growth medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml). After 2–3 weeks viable colonies were subcultured using cloning rings. Metabolic labeling with [35S]Na2SO4 was carried out as described previously (18Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larrain J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were extracted with immunoprecipitation buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and aliquots of the extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C with affinity purified rabbit anti-syndecan-1 (22Larrain J.

Nuñez R. Koenig C.S. Carey D.J. Brandan E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) antibodies. The immune complexes were harvested by the addition of protein A-agarose beads followed by centrifugation. The amount of proteoglycans precipitated was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Some aliquots were analyzed by Sepharose-CL 4B for the presence of syndecan-1 (data not shown). For construction of the pMYOCAT reporter plasmid, a 688-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to a region of the myogenin promoter that contains MEF1 and E box sites (from +62 to −626 nucleotides (31Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjei P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)) was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction using a mouse BALB/c genomic library as template. The fragment was subcloned in the pCAT-basic vector. The identity of the DNA insert was verified by DNA sequence analysis using the Sequenase kit. The cells were plated in growth medium 1 day before transfection at a density of 6000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm plates. For transfection the cells were incubated for 6 h in Opti-MEM I containing 5 μg of each plasmid and 15 μg of LipofectAMINE. After transfection the cells were incubated for 14 h in Opti-MEM I containing 10% FCS and 0.5% CEE. The cells were then washed twice with HBSS and incubated for 2 days in growth medium followed by 1 or 2 days in differentiation medium or 30 h in differentiation medium containing bFGF (0–30 ng/ml). The cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (22Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18418-18424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed at least two times with at least two plasmid DNA preparations. Myoblasts and myoblasts induced to differentiate for 2, 3, or 4 days were washed twice with PBS and lysed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 25 °C. The cells were scraped, and creatine kinase activity was determined using the creatine kinase assay kit. All data points represent the mean of duplicate determinations from three independent experiments. Cells to be immunostained were grown on coverslips. The medium was removed, and the coverslips were rinsed with PBS. For staining of intracellular myosin, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated with the primary antibodies. The cells were then rinsed with BLOTTO and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with affinity purified fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in BLOTTO. After rinsing, the coverslips were mounted and viewed with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Cell extracts obtained as above were electrophoresed through 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Filters were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Blotto (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk) and incubated with monoclonal anti-myosin (1/500) or anti-α tubulin (1/500) for 1 h at room temperature. The bound antibodies were visualized with affinity purified alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Conditioned medium from 6 plates (100 mm) of cells induced to differentiate for 30 h was collected and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl. After extensive washing with the equilibration buffer, the column was eluted with the same buffer containing 2 m NaCl. bFGF in the eluted fractions was determined using the bFGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. DNA was determined in aliquots of cells extracts as described (32Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 443-475Crossref Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). Protein was determined as described (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The expression of early myogenic regulators like myogenin is strongly inhibited by growth factors such as bFGF and HGF-SF (7Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5960-5963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Anastasi S. Giordano S. Sthandier O. Gambarotta G. Maione R. Comoglio P. Amati P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The binding of these growth factors to their signaling receptors and their biological activities are strongly potentiated by binding to heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (15Naka D. Ishii T. Shimomura T. Hishida T. Hara H. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 34Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). To determine if heparan sulfate proteoglycans could regulate myogenin expression by modulation of heparin-dependent growth factor activity, we evaluated the effect of chlorate, a metabolic inhibitor of heparan sulfate synthesis, and heparin, a heparan sulfate analogue, on the activation of myogenin expression. Fig. 1 a shows the result of Northern blot analysis using a myogenin cDNA probe that was hybridized to total RNA isolated from C2C12 myoblasts incubated in differentiation medium for 30 h in the presence (lane 1) or absence (lane 2) of 10 ng/ml bFGF. As expected, bFGF inhibited the induction of myogenin expression that occurs during myoblast differentiation (7Brunetti A. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5960-5963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When myoblasts were preincubated with 50 mm sodium chlorate (lane 3), bFGF failed to inhibit myogenin expression. The inhibitory activity of bFGF on myogenin expression was partially restored by addition of 10 ng/ml heparin (lane 4). These results demonstrate that inhibition of myogenin expression by bFGF is dependent on the presence of myoblast heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We have reported previously that the expression of the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 is down-regulated during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells (22Larrain J. Cizmeci-Smith G. Troncoso V. Stahl R.C. Carey D.J. Brandan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18418-18424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that after terminal differentiation was initiated, down-regulation of cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans involved in bFGF signaling was necessary to attenuate the strong differentiation-inhibiting activity of bFGF. To determine whether the amount of heparan sulfate present on differentiating myoblasts was indeed limiting bFGF activity, we evaluated the effect of exogenous heparin on bFGF activity in myoblasts induced to differentiate for 30 h. In order to have a more sensitive assay for bFGF-dependent effects on myogenesis, a myogenin reporter plasmid consisting of ∼700 base pairs of the mouse myogenin promoter (31Edmondson D.G. Cheng T.C. Cserjei P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) linked to a CAT reporter (pMYOCAT) was constructed. pMYOCAT expression was induced in differentiation medium and inhibited by bFGF similarly to myogenin mRNA expression analyzed by Northern blot (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, exogenous heparin produced a significant and concentration-dependent potentiation of the inhibitory effect of bFGF on pMYOCAT activity in differentiating myoblasts. This observation suggests that a decrease in heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression could modulate activation of myogenin expression. We reasoned if down-regulation of syndecan-1 expression was responsible for the decrease in bFGF activity, then its constitutive expression would inhibit or delay myogenesis. To test this idea a cDNA coding for full-length rat syndecan-1 (29Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V. Stahl R.C. Teichman L.J. Chernousov M. Cowan K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15729-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the selectable expression vector pCMVneo (Fig. 2 A) and used to stably transfect C2C12 myoblasts. Clones were selected under growth conditions in the presence of G418. As a control, myoblasts were transfected with the same vector containing no cDNA insert. A total of 8 syndecan-1-transfected G418-resistant clones were isolated. Several of these clones were chosen for more detailed analysis. G418-resistant clones were analyzed by Northern blot for expression of the syndecan-1 transgene. Fig. 2 B shows the results of this analysis using a full-length syndecan-1 cDNA probe that was hybridized to total RNA isolated from control-transfected myoblasts (lane1) and four syndecan-1-transfected clones (lanes 2–6). As expected, hybridization signals were detected in all lanes for the endogenous syndecan-1 mRNA (arrows). Three G418-resistant clones (S1, lane 2; S2, lanes 3 and 6; S4, lane 4) also revealed an additional hybridization signal. The size of this band (∼1,000 nucleotides) was consistent with the expected size of the polyadenylated product of the syndecan-1 expression vector. To analyze syndecan-1 synthesis in the stably transfected clones, myoblasts, and myoblasts that were induced to differentiate for 4 days were metabolically labeled with [35S]Na2SO4, and detergent extracts were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-syndecan-1 (29Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V. Stahl R.C. Teichman L.J. Chernousov M. Cowan K. Carey D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15729-15736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-glypican antibodies (17Campos A. Nuñez R. Koenig C.S. Carey D.J. Brandan E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows the results obtained for clones C1, S2, and S4. At the myoblast stage clone S2 showed an increase in the amount of35SO4-labeled syndecan-1 over the control clone C1. After 4 days of differentiation (when endogenous syndecan-1 expression is down-regulated), clones S2 and S4 showed approximately 2–3-fold increases in 35SO4-labeled syndecan-1 with respect to the control clone. The increased expression of syndecan-1 in the transfected cells was specific for this proteoglycan and was not seen with glypican. As shown in Fig. 3 (inset), the amount of 35SO4-labeled glypican increased in all the clones after triggering of differentiation, consistent with previous findings (18Brandan E. Carey D.J. Larrain J. Melo F. Campos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 170-176PubMed Google Scholar). Clones S2 and S4 synthesized similar amounts of glypican as control cells. The capacity of syndecan-1-transfected clones to differentiate was compared with that of wild type C2C12 cells and with control-transfected cells. Both morphological and muscle-specific biochemical markers were evaluated. Fig. 4 shows the morphology of proliferating myoblasts (left panels) and myoblasts that were induced to differentiate for 4 days (right panels). The syndecan-1-transfected S2 myoblasts spread more extensively than wild type or control-transfected cells and appeared larger and more flattened. This was reminiscent of the morphology of syndecan-1-transfected Schwann cells reported previously (30Carey D.J. Stahl R.C. Cizmeci-Smith G. Asundi V.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A more striking observation was the essentially complete failure of S2 and S4 myoblasts to undergo fusion to myotubes. In contrast, by 4 days of differentiation many wild type and control-transfected cells had fused to form multinucleated myotubes. Table I shows the expression of the muscle-specific isoform of creatine kinase and myosin heavy chain during differentiation. In wild type and control-transfected cells, creatine kinase-specific activity increases approximately 40-fold over the levels in non-induced myoblasts. In contrast, little increase in creatine kinase activity was detected in syndecan-1-transfected S2 and S4 cells. Myosin heavy chain expression was also diminished in the syndecan-1 transfectants after 4 days in differentiation medium compared with wild type and control-transfected cells.Table IExpressions of creatine kinase and myosin heavy chain are inhibited in syndecan-1-expressing cellsCreatine kinaseMyosin/tubulin, (Day 4)Day 0Day 4WT5 ± 1242 ± 15 (100)1.06 ± 0.06C14 ± 1189 ± 20 (98)1.00 ± 0.04S25 ± 135 ± 9 (15)0.14 ± 0.02S43 ± 115 ± 5 (10)0.12 ± 0.02Wild type (WT), control-transfected (clone C1), and syndecan-1-transfected (clones S2 and S4) C2C12 cells were plated and incubated in differentiation medium.

However, the function of ATP hydrolysis in the repair reaction is controversial. In this paper we describe a steady-state kinetic analysis of the DNA-activated ATPase of human MutSα. Comparison of salt concentration effects on mismatch repair and mismatch-provoked excision in HeLa nuclear extracts with salt effects on the DNA-activated ATPase suggests that ATP hydrolysis by MutSα is involved in the rate determining step in the repair pathway. While the ATPase is activated by homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA, the half-maximal concentration for activation by heteroduplex DNA is significantly lower under physiological salt concentrations. Furthermore, at optimal salt concentration, heteroduplex DNA increases the k cat for ATP hydrolysis to a greater extent than does homoduplex DNA. We also demonstrate that the degree of ATPase activation is dependent on DNA chain length, with thek cat for hydrolysis increasing significantly with chain length of the DNA cofactor. These results are discussed in terms of the translocation (Allen, D. J., Makhov, A., Grilley, M., Taylor, J., Thresher, R., Modrich, P., and Griffith, J. D.

Bacterial MutS and MutL play critical roles in the initiation of the prokaryotic mismatch repair reaction. Mismatch recognition is mediated by a MutS homodimer (8Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 9Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and MutL, which exists as a homodimer in solution, binds to the MutS·DNA complex in a reaction that requires ATP but is apparently independent of nucleotide hydrolysis (12Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MutL is thought to interface mismatch recognition by MutS to activities that function subsequent to mismatch recognition (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 13Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, both MutS and MutL are required for the mismatch-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease (14Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which serves to identify the newly synthesized DNA strand, and for activation of DNA helicase II, which initiates excision at the nick introduced by MutH into an unmethylated d(GATC) sequence on the newly synthesized strand (15Yamaguchi M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MutL appears to play a direct role in the latter reaction since the protein has been shown to physically interact with and to dramatically activate helicase II on conventional helicase substrates (15Yamaguchi M.

A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the activities of MutLα in eukaryotic mismatch repair, yeast MutLα has been shown to form a ternary complex with MutSα and a mismatch, a reaction that like assembly of the bacterial MutL·MutS·heteroduplex ternary complex, requires ATP but apparently does not depend on ATP hydrolysis (29Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9837-9841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).In addition to its mispair recognition activity, bacterial MutS has an associated ATPase activity that is required for function of the protein in mismatch repair. Genetic inactivation of the nucleotide binding site results in a dominant negative phenotype (30Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding site consensus sequence is conserved in eukaryotic MutS homologs, and mutant studies have implicated the nucleotide binding centers of yMSH2, hMSH2, and hMSH6 in mismatch repair (32Alani E.

There is general agreement in the literature that prokaryotic and eukaryotic MutS homologs are responsible for the initial recognition of mismatches, with subsequent repair complex assembly leading to excision and resynthesis steps of the reaction (4Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 6Umar A. Kunkel T.A.

In the translocation model, MutS uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along the DNA contour, a mechanism that would permit coupling of mismatch recognition to recognition of the secondary site that determines strand specificity of the reaction (11Allen D.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the molecular switch model, the process of ATP binding and hydrolysis serve to switch the protein between two states, one of which is active in mismatch binding and one of which is not (34Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This model invokes mismatch recognition by the MutSα·ADP complex, which serves to recruit downstream repair activities to the mismatch. Subsequent binding of ATP results in release of MutSα from the DNA, and repair ensues.Both of these models are based on the observation that ATP reduces the efficiency of mismatch recognition by bacterial MutS and eukaryotic MutSα (12Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and that ATP challenge of specific complexes between MutS and heteroduplex DNA results in departure of the protein from the mismatch (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The crucial mechanistic question with respect to these two models is the path by which the MutS homolog leaves the mismatch upon ATP challenge, directly into solution or along the helix contour by translocation. In this paper, we demonstrate using human MutSα that reaction conditions that maximize DNA repairin vitro are identical to those that maximize ATP turnover, not DNA binding, in the presence of mismatch DNA. These observations are discussed in the context of the two models proposed for the role of ATP hydrolysis in DNA mismatch repair. The accompanying paper (35Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) demonstrates that ADP is not required for mismatch recognition by hMutSα and shows that ATP-promoted dissociation of hMutSα from small heteroduplexes is blocked by physical barriers placed at the ends of the DNA, consistent with a translocation mechanism.DISCUSSIONThe requirement for ATP hydrolysis by MutS homologs during mismatch repair is clearly documented (30Haber L.T. Walker G.C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2707-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Wu T.H. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5393-5400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Alani E. Sokolsky T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the modulating effects of ATP and ATP analogs on complex formation between MutS homologs and heteroduplex DNA are well established. However, the interpretation of these effects is a matter of some debate. The translocation model invokes ATP binding and hydrolysis in movement of the protein along the helix (11Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), an effect that would provide a physical mechanism for coupling mismatch recognition to recognition of the strand break elsewhere on the helix that directs repair (15Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The molecular switch model posits that ATP hydrolysis by hMutSα fulfills a signaling function, somewhat analogous to the role GTP hydrolysis plays in signaling by the G-protein family (41Bokoch G.M. Der C.J. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this model, mismatch recognition is mediated by the hMutSα·ADP complex, which binds to the mispair with nearly irreversible affinity (34Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The resulting ADP·hMutSα·DNA complex signals the presence of the lesion and serves as an assembly site for downstream repair activities, with subsequent ATP binding resulting in release of hMutSα from the DNA so that repair may proceed. In order to address these two models and to further clarify the role of ATP hydrolysis by MutS homologs in mismatch repair, we have used a steady-state kinetic approach to establish reaction parameters for the hMutSα ATPase and have compared the effects of reaction conditions on these ATPase parameters with those for mismatch repair. The accompanying paper describes the effects of nucleotides on the dynamics of hMutSα-heteroduplex interaction and examines the nature of the molecular path by which hMutSα dissociates from small heteroduplexes (35Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).The effects of salt concentration on the DNA-activated hMutSα ATPase reaction described may serve to clarify some of the puzzling effects alluded to above with respect to DNA effects on this MutS homolog activity. We have shown that the DNA activation of the ATPase is largely due to an increase in k cat,ATP, with decrease in activity at elevated salt concentrations due to turnover rate as well as a reduced apparent affinity for DNA. The resulting salt profile for the ATPase is strikingly similar to that of mismatch repair and mismatch-provoked excision reactions, strongly suggesting that hMutSα ATP hydrolysis is involved in the slow step that determines the overall rate of repair.These kinetic studies are also relevant to the question of the role ATP hydrolysis by hMutSα plays in mismatch repair. We have shown that conditions which maximize the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of hMutSα also maximize mismatch repair. This is in agreement with the concept that ATP hydrolysis is performing an active translocation role, which is necessary and limiting for subsequent steps in the repair pathway. However, these findings are difficult to reconcile with an information-based role for ATP hydrolysis. The role of ATP hydrolysis in the molecular switch model is to regenerate the “on” form of hMutSα (e.g. on a per-molecule basis, hMutSα must bind and hydrolyze ATP to regenerate a hMutSα·ADP complex in order to participate in further rounds of mismatch recognition and signaling). However, in the extract systems used to study in vitromismatch repair, hMutSα is in 20-fold excess over heteroduplex (23Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and is not limiting for repair (26Drummond J.T. Genschel J. Wolf E. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Consequently, there is no need to regenerate an “on” signal for efficient repair to occur in these cell-free systems. The limiting nature of hMutSα, therefore, is not in its solution concentration (e.g. rate or level of binding) but in its function subsequent to mismatch binding.Inasmuch as ATP binding is sufficient to promote the dissociation of specific hMutSα·mismatch complexes (18Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 33Iaccarino I. Marra G. Palombo F. Jiricny J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2677-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 34Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the requirement for ATP hydrolysis cannot be attributed to its function in release of hMutSα from the mismatch. At the saturating concentrations of ATP used in these studies, release of hMutSα from the mismatch will be independent of the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, single-turnover ATP hydrolysis experiments have shown that the rate of ATP hydrolysis is fast (e.g. chemistry is not rate-limiting) relative to the steady-state rate of ATP turnover (34Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Upon binding ATP, hMutSα rapidly hydrolyzes the nucleotide, and the ADP complex is relatively long lived. At saturating ATP, the steady-state concentration of hMutSα·ADP will be unaffected by subtle changes in the steady-state turnover rate of ATP. Thus, in a model where the steady-state concentration of hMutSα·ADP is the only relevant species that interacts with heteroduplex, there is no expected correlation between the rate of ATP turnover and the rate of repair.We have also observed chain length effects with respect to DNA cofactor activation of the ATPase, with longer DNAs consistently found to be better activators than oligonucleotide duplexes due to ak cat effect. While these data cannot be definitively interpreted in terms of mechanism, it is interesting to note that an increase in k cat,ATP with increased DNA chain length is the expected result for a translocation mechanism (42Young M.C. Kuhl S.B. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1436-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 43Young M.C. Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to rationalize these findings with the molecular switch model, which does not invoke a functional role for sequences external to the mispair.We thus regard the results presented here as inconsistent with a nucleotide signaling role in hMutSα function. Indeed, in the accompanying paper (35Blackwell L.J. Martik D. Bjornson K.P. Bjornson E.S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32055-32062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we show that free DNA termini are required for ATP-promoted hMutSα dissociation from a small heteroduplex, a finding which implies that hMutSα does in fact translocate along the helix in the presence of the nucleotide. As originally demonstrated in bacteria (1Claverys J.-P. Lacks S.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 50: 133-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Meselson M. Low K.B. Recombination of the Genetic Material. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 91-113Google Scholar, 3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), mismatch repair also plays an important role in stabilization of the genome of eukaryotes by correcting DNA biosynthetic errors and by participating in the cellular response to some types of DNA damage (reviewed in Refs.4Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 5Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 6Umar A. Kunkel T.A.

Markowitz S.D. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Bacterial MutS and MutL play critical roles in the initiation of the prokaryotic mismatch repair reaction. Mismatch recognition is mediated by a MutS homodimer (8Su S.-S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5057-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 9Su S.-S. Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4467-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and MutL, which exists as a homodimer in solution, binds to the MutS·DNA complex in a reaction that requires ATP but is apparently independent of nucleotide hydrolysis (12Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1000-1004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MutL is thought to interface mismatch recognition by MutS to activities that function subsequent to mismatch recognition (3Modrich P. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 229-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 13Sancar A. Hearst J.E. Science. 1993; 259: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, both MutS and MutL are required for the mismatch-dependent activation of the MutH d(GATC) endonuclease (14Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which serves to identify the newly synthesized DNA strand, and for activation of DNA helicase II, which initiates excision at the nick introduced by MutH into an unmethylated d(GATC) sequence on the newly synthesized strand (15Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9202-9207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MutL appears to play a direct role in the latter reaction since the protein has been shown to physically interact with and to dramatically activate helicase II on conventional helicase substrates (15Yamaguchi M. Dao V. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9197-9201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Hall M.C. Jordan J.R. Matson S.W.

Furthermore, our results show that specific types of in vivo phosphorylation of the linker histone tails influence both the binding to mononucleosomes and the aggregation of polynucleosomes.

The various linker histones containing a globular central region flanked by highly basic and hydrophilic C- and N-terminal tails (7Bradbury E.M. Cary P.D. Chapman G.E. Crane-Robinson C. Damby S.E.

There is evidence that histone H1 may interact differently with transcriptionally active and inactive regions of chromatin (11Nacheva G.A. Guschin D.Y. Preobrazhenskaya O.V. Karpov V.L. Ebralidse K.K. Mirzabekov A.D. Cell. 1989; 58: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Linker histones are also thought to modulate nucleosome position (12Wolffe A., P. Cell. 1994; 77: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E., D. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) and to influence replication efficiency in vitro (14Halmer L. Gruss C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1420-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The presence of this large number of various H1 histone subtypes and their possible posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation (15Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), make it very probable that H1 histones play numerous structural and functional roles in chromatin. Until now, no specific role for the various variants has been established although Kaludov et al. (16Kaludov N.K. Pabón-Peña L. Seavy M. Robinson G. Hurt M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15120-15127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showed that the mouse histone H1b binds preferentially to a regulatory sequence within a mouse H3.2 replication-dependent histone gene. Previous analysis of the structural role of H1 histones demonstrated that three subfractions of H1 histones differ in their effectiveness in condensing DNA fibers into ordered aggregates (17Liao L.W. Cole K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10124-10128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that histone subtype H1t, compared with other subtypes, differs in its ability to condense chromatin (18Delucia F. Faraone-Menella M.R. D’Erme M. Quesada P. Caiafa P. Farina B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 32-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,19Khadake J.R. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differences in the binding of H1 variants to DNA or phosphorylated H1 histones to DNA have been shown (20Clark D.J. Thomas J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Hill C.S. Rimmer J.M. Green B.N. Finch J.T. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1939-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The present work was undertaken to extend these earlier binding studies using an in vitro assay developed by Wolffe and Hayes (22Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 314-330Google Scholar), enabling us to systematically study the binding of all known linker histones to a model chromatin complex. The complex is based on a DNA fragment containing the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV LTR)1 promotor, the chromatin structure of which has been well characterized (23Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The MMTV LTR reproducibly acquires a series of six positioned nucleosomes (24Archer T.K. Cordingly M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We have extended our systematic study of the histone-chromatin complexes formed by all known various H1 subtypes, H1a to H1e, H10, and H1t, to differently phosphorylated H1 histones according to the various phases of the cell cycle. The in vitro results presented here suggest that (i) differences in binding to a single mononucleosome (210 bp) and (ii) differences in aggregation of polynucleosomes (1.3 kbp, 6 nucleosomes) exist among the various linker histones. Furthermore, we found that (iii) specific types of in vivo phosphorylation of the linker histone tails do not influence binding to mononucleosomes, whereas (iv) aggregation of polynucleosomes was decreased in the case of highly phosphorylated mitotic H1 histones. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in monolayer cultures and cultivated in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in the presence of 5% CO2. To obtain cells from the G1 phase, S phase, and mitosis, we used a cell synchronization method described by Talasz et al. (15Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Routine microscopic examination and FACS analysis showed that more than 90% of the cells were in the various cell cycle phases. For isolation of H1 histones, nuclei from mouse liver or NIH fibroblasts were prepared as described by Zubay and Doty (25Zubay G. Doty P. J. Mol. Biol. 1959; 1: 1-20Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and Talasz et al. (15Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). H1 histones were isolated from the resulting nuclear preparations by extracting with 5% perchloric acid at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with trichloroacetic acid to the final concentration of 20% and allowed to stand for 1 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was washed once with acetone-HCl and thereafter with acetone, resuspended in water containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and freeze-dried. The equipment used consisted of two Beckman model 114M pumps, a 421A system controller, and a model 165 variable-wavelength UV-visible detector. The effluent was monitored at 210 nm and the peaks were recorded using Beckman System Gold software. Protein separation was performed on a Nucleosil 300–5 C4 column (12.5 or 25 cm × 0.8 cm, 5-μm beads, 300 Å). The freeze-dried proteins were dissolved in 0.04 m 2-mercaptoethanol/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and samples of 100–300 μg of histones were loaded onto the column. At a constant flow rate of 1 and 1.5 ml/min, the H1 histones were eluted using a 45-min linear gradient from 34 to 54% solvent B (solvent A, water containing 15% ethylene glycolmonomethylether and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, ethylene glycolmonomethylether (15%)/70% acetonitrile (85%) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (26Lindner H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 450: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Lindner H. Helliger W. Chromatographia. 1990; 30: 518-522Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). High performance capillary electrophoresis of histone H1 proteins was performed with slight modifications according to Lindner et al. (29Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Talasz H. Wurm M. Sarg B. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 608: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30Lindner H. Helliger W. Sarg B. Meraner C. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In short, an untreated capillary (57/50 cm) was used, and separation was performed in a 10 mmtriethylamine/H3PO4 buffer system (pH 2.0) containing 90 mm perchloric acid and 0.02% hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The plasmid pMMTV-CAT was prepared from Escherichia coli cells harboring this plasmid using the alkali lysis method and the PC-500 Nucleobond kit (Macherey-Nagel). Plasmid DNA was digested either with restriction endonucleases SacI and BamHI (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C (2 units/μg of DNA overnight), which deliberated a 210-bp insert containing part of the MMTV LTR promotor region, or with restriction endonucleases BamHI and HindIII (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C (2 units/μg of DNA overnight), which liberated a 1.3-kbp insert containing the whole MMTV LTR promotor region. The inserts were purified from the digest on 1% agarose gels in 1× TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.3) using the GenElute Agarose Spin Columns (Supelco, Bellefonte). The 210-bp and 1.3-kbp DNA fragments were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and used for nucleosome reconstitution experiments. The naked nonspecific DNA (146 bp) was recovered from mouse liver mononucleosome particles with phenol-chloroform extraction after proteinase K (50 μg/1 mg of DNA) digestion in the presence of 1% SDS at 37 °C for 2 h. Mononucleosomes were recovered from mouse liver nuclei as described in Ref. 31Zalenskaya I.A. Pospelov V.A. Zalensky A.O. Vorob’ev V.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar. Nuclei from mouse liver were prepared (25Zubay G. Doty P. J. Mol. Biol. 1959; 1: 1-20Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and the crude nuclear extract was centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor through a 2.2 m sucrose (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine) cushion at 25,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to remove residual cytoplasmic components. Soluble chromatin was obtained by brief micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) digestion of the nuclei (31Zalenskaya I.A. Pospelov V.A. Zalensky A.O. Vorob’ev V.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 473-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Digestion of nuclei with 10 units of micrococcal nuclease per 1 mg of DNA for 30 s at 37 °C in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3m sucrose, 1 mm CaCl2 (Buffer 1) produces chromatin lengths of 10–30 nucleosomes. To remove linker histone H1 this soluble chromatin was treated with Dowex 50 W-X2 (Sigma) in 0.4 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Soluble chromatin without H1 histones was transferred to a dialysis bag (with a molecular size limit of 3 kDa) and dialyzed against Buffer 1 for 4 h. Thereafter, chromatin was redigested with 60 units of micrococcal nuclease per 1 mg of DNA for 10 min. Core particles were separated on 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradients containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na2EDTA by centrifuging in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 25,000 rpm for 17 h at 4 °C. Nucleosomes were reconstituted onto radiolabeled DNA fragments by exchange with mouse liver core particles (donor chromatin) according to Drew and Travers (32Drew H.R. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 773-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In the case of reconstitution onto a 1.3-kbp DNA fragment, the original 6 μl of exchange reaction containing ∼3200 ng of donor chromatin, 520 ng of naked nonspecific DNA (146 bp), and 200 ng of labeled 1.3-kbp fragment of the MMTV promotor was incubated in 1 m NaCl for 1 h (all incubations at room temperature). By adding 2.75 μl of TE 1 m NaCl was then diluted to 0.8 m NaCl followed by addition of 4.55 μl of TE to 0.6 m NaCl, for 30 min each (TE consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Thereafter, it was diluted to 0.4 m NaCl by addition of 9.1 μl of TE and to 0.1 m NaCl by addition of 82 μl TE, for 30 min each. The salt concentration was finally diluted to 0.05 m NaCl with 109 μl of TE. In this condition, 100% of the labeled 1.3-kbp MMTV promotor fragment was assembled to a saturated oligonucleosome chain. In the case of reconstitution onto 210-bp DNA fragments, the original 6 μl of exchange reaction containing ∼1300 ng of donor chromatin, ∼260 ng of naked nonspecific DNA (146 bp), and 80–100 ng of labeled 210-bp fragment of the MMTV promotor was incubated for 1 h (all incubations at room temperature) in 1 m NaCl. This was then diluted from 1 m NaCl to 0.05 mNaCl with TE as described for the exchange reaction onto 1.3-kbp. About 50–60% of the labeled MMTV LTR promotor 210-bp fragment was assembled to mononucleosome cores as monitored with electrophoresis. To ensure accurate protein concentration determination BCA protein assay (Pierce), spectrophotometry at 230 nm and reversed-phase HPLC with peak integration were used for concentration measurement of H1 histones. Additionally, we used the dotMETRIC protein assay (Geno Technology, Inc.), because the results obtained with this assay are not dependent on the amino acid composition of the protein, making the assay independent of protein-to-protein variation. Nucleosomes reconstituted with approximately 7 ng of radioactively end-labeled 210-bp MMTV LTR DNA in the presence of 110 ng of unlabeled nonspecific DNA were incubated with various amounts of histone H1 subtypes (see legend to Fig. 2) in 17 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Because about 40% of labeled DNA is free DNA, 4.2 ng (60%) of labeled DNA is reconstituted in mononucleosomes. Because the DNA is 210 base pairs, the concentration of the labeled mononucleosomes is about 2 nm. In the case of a 1.3-kbp fragment, approximately 10 ng of labeled fragment in reconstituted nucleosomes was incubated with various amounts of histone H1 subtypes (see legend to Fig. 7) in 10 μl of binding buffer in the presence of 120 ng of unlabeled nonspecific DNA (146 bp). For the 1.3-kbp fragment we used conditions where no free labeled DNA exists, this means that 10 ng of labeled DNA was reconstituted in polynucleosomes. Because the DNA was 1.3 kbp, the concentration of the polynucleosomes was about 1 nm.Figure 7Chromatin aggregation properties of the various H1 histone subtypes. A, nucleoprotein gel shift assay of the polynucleosome aggregation behavior of H1a, H1b, H1c, H1d/e, H10, and H1t. The position of free DNA, 6-mer polynucleosomes (PolyNuc), H1-polynucleosome complex (PolyNuc-H1), and aggregates is indicated. Polynucleosomes reconstituted with radioactively end-labeled 1.3-kbp MMTV LTR DNA were incubated with 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 ng of H1 subtypes, corresponding to 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 270, and 360 nm(lanes 2–8, respectively). In the case of H1b, we used higher concentrations and titrated with 0, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 192 ng (H1b high conc.). Lane 1, free 1.3-kbp DNA. Complexes were separated on 0.7% agarose gels, and the gels were autoradiographed. B, quantitative analysis of the polynucleosome H1 aggregates formed by titration with various H1 subtypes.

DNA was incubated with various amounts of histone H1 subtypes (see legend to Fig. 3) in 17 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol). Samples from reconstitution of nucleosomes or DNA with linker histones were incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min and loaded directly onto running 0.7% agarose gels in 0.1× TB (1× TB is 90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, pH 8.3) or in 0.5× TBE. Running buffer was circulated throughout the experiment at a rate sufficient to prevent formation of either pH or ion gradients. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The quality and quantity of the dried gels were determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics Inc.). For amplification and internal labeling of a 210-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the first A nucleosome of the MMTV LTR promotor (24Archer T.K. Cordingly M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we used the plasmid pMMTV-CAT and the primers 5′-CTT AGT GTT CTA TTT TCC TAT GTT CT-3′ and 5′-GAT GTG CGG GGG GAC-3′. Polymerase chain reaction radiolabeling reactions (50 μl) contained 1 ng of supercoiled plasmid template; 2 μm each primer; 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.85; 25 mm KCl; 5 mm (NH4)2SO4; 2 mm MgSO4; 200 μm each of the three nucleotides dATP, dGTP, and dTTP; 20 μm dCTP; and 2.5 units of Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). In addition, 5 μl of [32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol, 3.3 μm) was added to a final concentration of 0.33 μm. Thirty cycles of polymerase chain reaction were performed (denaturation, 30 s at 94 °C; annealing, 1 min at 51 °C; elongation, 1 min at 72 °C) after an initial 5 min of denaturation at 95 °C. The samples were precipitated and washed with ethanol and dried. Mononucleosomes (100 ng of specific internally labeled 210-bp DNA and 1600 ng of nonspecific 146-bp DNA) in the presence or absence of 200 ng of histone H1 (w/w ratio of histone to DNA was 0.12) were digested with 0.15, 0.3, or 0.6 units of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C. Incubation with histone H1 was performed as described above. Ca2+ was adjusted to 2 mm concomitantly with the addition of micrococcal nuclease. Micrococcal nuclease digestions were terminated by adding of EDTA (5 mm), SDS (0.25%, w/v), and proteinase K (0.5 μg/ml). Digestion with proteinase K lasted 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction. The labeled DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 9% polyacrylamide gels with 1× TBE as running buffer. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. H1 histones from mitotic cells were digested with alkaline phosphatase basically as described (33Sherod D. Johnson G. Chalkley R. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Harisanova N.T. Ralchev K.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1986; 11: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). About 50 μg of H1 histones in 140 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was mixed with 2 units of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (Sigma), corresponding to 40 units/mg histone. Incubation at 22 °C was terminated after 16 h by adjusting the incubation mixture to 5% perchloric acid. The histone H1 was resolved as described above. To test mononucleosome cores for their ability to bind the various linker histones we first fractionated mouse liver H1 histones using reversed-phase HPLC. The resulting subtypes and subfractions obtained were designated according to the nomenclature of Lennox et al. (35Lennox R.W. Oshima R.G. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5183-5189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mouse liver we found H1a, H1b, H1c, and H10 as pure subtypes, whereas one subfraction was a mixture containing the variants H1d and H1e (Fig. 1 A) (28Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Histone subtype H1t was obtained by means of reversed-phase HPLC fractionation of mouse testis (Fig. 1 B) (36Lindner H. Helliger W. Parvez H. Caudy P. Parvez S. Roland-Gosselin P. Progress in HPLC-HPCE. 5. VSP, Utrecht, The Netherlands1997: 97-113Google Scholar). Mononucleosome cores were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and reconstituted with a DNA fragment of the MMTV LTR promotor. We used a 210-bp fragment corresponding to the first A nucleosome described by Archer et al. (24Archer T.K. Cordingly M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We assembled about 50–60% of the labeled MMTV LTR DNA with a single octamer, whereas the rest remained unbound and served as a naked DNA control (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Fig. 2 shows the binding pattern of the mouse H1 histones H1a to H1e, H10, H1t, and total H1 histones from mouse liver and testis. Similar to reconstitution experiments performed by other groups (37Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we found that the reconstitutes were preferentially bound by the various linker histone subtypes over the naked DNA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3–8). After the octamer DNA complex shifted completely to the H1 octamer DNA complex, the H1 histone started to bind to naked DNA (disappearance of free DNA) and an H1 DNA complex appeared (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8). This phenomenon is visible at titration with H1a, H1c, H1d/e, H10, and total liver H1, but not clearly pronounced with H1b, H1t, and total testis H1 histones. Nucleoprotein gels, such as those shown in Fig. 2 A, were quantitatively analyzed to determine the relative nucleosome binding affinity of the various linker histone subtypes (Fig. 2 B). This analysis revealed that none of the subtypes has significantly different affinity, with the exception of histone H1b. For this H1b subtype we found a dissociation constant of 8–16 nm, whereas the dissociation constant of all other subtypes varied between 1 and 3 nm. In the cases of H1b and H1t, the binding to free DNA appears to be less strong than in the case of H1a. To test whether the various H1 subtypes have different affinities for free DNA we directly measured the binding of H1 subtypes to not nucleosomal organized DNA. These results (Fig. 3) further confirmed our finding that H1b and H1t have less stronger affinities not only to nucleosomal organized DNA but also to free DNA. As shown by Ura et al. (38Ura K. Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27171-27174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), micrococcal nuclease digestion of H1 histone-bound chromatin leads to an accumulation of a kinetic intermediate containing all the histones and 166–168 bp of DNA, known as the chromatosome (39Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). We used this chromatosomal stop (40Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) as a diagnostic tool for correct incorporation of the various linker histone subtypes into chromatin. Chromatosome-length DNA was observed regardless of the histone subtype used to reconstitute the MMTV LTR promotor mononucleosomal cores. Fig. 4compares total H1 histones from mouse liver and H1b subtype (other subtypes not shown). With an H1/DNA ratio (w/w) of 0.12, corresponding to a calculated molar ratio of about one MMTV LTR promotor DNA H1 histone molecule per reconstituted nucleosome core, both total H1 from mouse liver and pure mouse H1b subtype induced the appearance of chromatosome-length DNA. To test the influence of phosphorylation of the histone tails on binding to the MMTV LTR promotor DNA octamer complex, we prepared linker histones in various phosphorylation states (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Total H1 histones from mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were prepared from synchronized cells passing through G1 phase, S phase, or mitosis. Capillary electrophoresis was used to measure the phosphorylation state of total H1 histones (Fig. 5). In growth-arrested cells at G1 phase, linker histones are unphosphorylated, whereas in late S phase, the H1 variants exist as a combination of molecules containing one to three phosphate groups, according to the particular subtype (15Talasz H. Helliger W. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1761-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The fastest migrating components in capillary electrophoresis are the unphosphorylated H1 histones (29Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Talasz H. Wurm M. Sarg B. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 608: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Lindner H. Helliger W. Parvez H. Caudy P. Parvez S. Roland-Gosselin P. Progress in HPLC-HPCE. 5. VSP, Utrecht, The Netherlands1997: 97-113Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A, peaks between 18 and 20.5 min). Histones from S phase cells (Fig. 5 B) and, to a great extent, highly phosphorylated H1 histone subtypes from cells in mitosis containing four to five phosphate groups migrate at lower speed. In the case of the most highly phosphorylated H1 histones, the main peaks are visible at 20.5–21.5 min (Fig. 5 C). When we digested the mitotic H1 histones with alkaline phosphatase, only peaks between 18 and 20.5 min were visible, corresponding to unphosphorylated H1 histones (Fig. 5 D). Fig. 6 A shows the association of cell cycle-specific linker histones with the MMTV LTR nucleosome core, whereas Fig. 6 B presents the quantitative analysis of these nucleoprotein gels. Both the unphosphorylated linker histones prepared from G1 cells and the medium phosphorylated H1 histones from S phase seem to have a binding constant of about 3–5 nm, with a total shift to the chromatosome at 32 nm. Interestingly, the very highly phosphorylated H1 histones from mitotic cells also have a binding constant of about 3–5 nm and shifted completely to the chromatosome with 32 nm (Fig. 6 A, mitosis).

https://openalex.org/W2077163123,"Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a major substrate of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I receptors, which upon phosphorylation on tyrosine docks several signaling molecules. Recently, IRS-1 was found to interact with αvβ3 integrins upon insulin stimulation. Integrins are transmembrane proteins that play an important role in adhesion between cells and between cells and extracellular matrix. One of the major proteins implicated in integrin signaling is pp125FAK, a cytosolic tyrosine kinase, which upon integrin engagement becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently binds to c-Src. Here, we established a mammalian two-hybrid system to show that pp125FAK binds to IRS-1. This association depends largely on the C terminus of pp125FAK but not on pp125FAK tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of pp125FAK with IRS-1 in 293 cells, suggesting a possible biological function of this association. When IRS-1 was expressed in 293 cells together with pp125FAK or Src, we found extensive IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In pp125FAK-expressing cells, this was concomitant with increased association of IRS-1 with Src homology 2-containing proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase p85α subunit, and Src homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2. In addition, pp125FAK-induced association of IRS-1 with PI 3-kinase resulted in increased PI 3-kinase activity. In contrast, no change in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was observed, indicating that pp125FAK-induced association between IRS-1 and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 does not affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Moreover, we found that engagement of integrins induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Considering our results together, we suggest that integrins and insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling pathways converge at an early point in the signaling cascade, which is the IRS-1 protein.

Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine is an immediate event after integrin engagement following cell interaction with the extracellular matrix. One of the major phosphorylated proteins is the cytosolic tyrosine kinase (focal adhesion kinase) pp125FAK,1 which upon integrin engagement becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine and activated (8Hanks S.K.

The pp125FAK sequence, which allows targeting of the kinase to the focal adhesions, is located in the C terminus (11Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J.

The major autophosphorylation site of pp125FAK is tyrosine 397, which upon phosphorylation becomes a binding site for the cytosolic tyrosine kinase c-Src (18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Association of c-Src leads to pp125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, creating binding sites for SH2-containing proteins such as growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and possibly for the p85α regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (20Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 21Chen H.-C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.-L. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Evidence for a role of pp125FAK in cell migration has been provided by the use of pp125FAK knockout mice. Indeed, cells from pp125FAK-deficient mice have reduced mobility and enhanced focal adhesion contact formation (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). In addition to integrins, a number of growth factors and neuropeptides, including platelet-derived growth factor, bombesin, endothelin, and lysophosphatidic acid (24Zachary I. Sinnett S.J.

Together, these data have led to the suggestion that pp125FAK is a key protein linking integrin and growth factor signaling pathways (27Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis underlying this cooperation remains ill defined. Recent studies suggest that synergistic interactions between growth factor and integrin signaling pathways are involved in regulation of cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration (28Schwartz M.A. Lechene C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6138-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J.

Experiments performed in our laboratory have shown that insulin stimulation induces phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of pp125FAK, depending on the adhesion state of the cells (31Baron V. Calléja V. Ferrari P. Alengrin F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7162-7168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Moreover, these studies suggest that pp125FAK is a direct substrate of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors. Recently, it was found that αvβ3 integrin associates with activated insulin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor and potentiates the biological responses induced by platelet-derived growth factor (32Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In addition, Vuori and Ruoslahti (33Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) have reported that insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) co-immunoprecipitates with αvβ3 integrin following insulin stimulation. IRS-1 is a docking protein implicated in the insulin and IGF-I signaling pathways (34White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its tyrosine phosphorylation, induced upon insulin and IGF-I stimulation, creates binding sites for SH2-containing proteins such as the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, the adaptor GRB2, and the SH2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), resulting in activation of the PI 3-kinase and the MAP kinase pathways (35Sun X.J.

The aim of our study was to investigate the potential cross-talk between the insulin receptor (IR)/IRS-1 signaling pathway and the integrin/pp125FAK signaling circuitry. We first looked at a putative interaction between pp125FAK and IRS-1. To do this, we established a mammalian two-hybrid system, which allows for the analysis of direct protein/protein interactions. In addition, we searched for the occurrence of an interaction between pp125FAK and IRS-1 in intact cells. The reporter vector pE1bLUC was kindly provided by Richard A. Maurer (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). pp125FAK cDNA, inserted at the EcoRI site into the pBluescript (KS−), was a generous gift from Thomas J. Parsons (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). The constitutive active and the kinase-dead Src cDNAs, subcloned into pSGT vector, were kindly provided by Sara Courtneidge (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Culture media and Geneticin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine fibronectin, vitronectin, and poly-l-lysine were from Sigma. 125I and [γ-32P]ATP were from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Orsay, France); 125I-protein A was labeled using the chloramine-T method as described previously (42Freychet P. Roth J. Neville D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 43: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, leupeptin, benzamidine, pepstatin, andl-α-phosphatidylinositol were from Sigma. Aprotinin was from Bayer (Bayer AG, Germany), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Protein A and protein G-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Enzymes for molecular biology were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antiserum to IRS-1 was prepared in our laboratory and was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal sequence comprising amino acids 1223–1235 of rat IRS-1. Immunoblotting of p42 MAP kinase was performed with rabbit antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies against phosphotyrosine/phosphothreonine p42/p44 MAP kinases were from New England Biolabs. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of pp125FAK were performed, respectively, with a mouse monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and with an antibody prepared in our laboratory by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide derived from the pp125FAK sequence comprising amino acids 392–406. Antibodies to phosphotyrosine and to the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase used for Western blotting were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Insulin was kindly provided by Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). 293 EBNA cells are human embryo kidney cells that constitutively express the EBNA-1 protein from the Epstein-Barr virus (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (43Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) (5 μg of DNA per 100-mm diameter dish). 18 h after transfection, cells were starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 20 h before use. 150-mm culture dishes were incubated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) or fibronectin (10 μg/ml) together with vitronectin (3 μg/ml), in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The dishes were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.5 mmNa2PO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and dried 1 h at 37 °C before use. NHIR cells are NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with the insulin receptor. They are maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 0.5 μg/ml Geneticin. Confluent cells were detached with trypsin and plated on the extracellular matrix protein-coated dishes in DMEM, 10% FCS. 24 h after the plating, NHIR cells were starved in 0.2% bovine serum albumin medium for 4 h. Cells were then stimulated or not stimulated with insulin (10−8m) and lysed for immunoprecipitation. To produce the pBKS/pp125FAK-ΔC, pBKS/pp125FAK was cleaved by NheI and ClaI. After a fill-in, religation was performed at 16 °C for 4 h. Kinase-deficient pp125FAK was produced by site-directed mutagenesis using the TransformerTM kit fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The two primers (Genset, Paris, France) were 5′-CCG CTC TAG AAC TAG TGG GCC CCC CGG GCT GC-3′, which changes the BamHI site toApaI in the pBKS polylinker, and 5′-GGC TGT AGC AAT CAG AAC ATG TAA AAA CTG C-3′, which changes Lys454 to Arg in pp125FAK. pp125FAK cDNAs were subcloned into pCEP by excision of pBKS constructs at the XbaI and XhoI sites and ligation with the NheI and XhoI sites of pCEP. The Y397F mutant of pp125FAK was made in the pBKS vector using Quick ChangeTM kit from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). The two primers were 5′-GAA ACA GAT GAC TTT GCA GAG-3′ and 5′-CTC TGC AAA GTC ATC TGT TTC-3′ (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The Y397F cDNA was then excised from pBKS using NotI and XhoI and inserted into pCEP cleaved by the same enzymes. To subclone constitutive active and kinase-dead Src cDNAs into pCEP vector, the Src cDNAs were excised of pSGT constructs at theSpeI/BglII sites and ligated into pCEP at theNheI/BamHI sites. Cells were washed with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (NaVO4). Cells were then lysed for 15 min on ice with buffer A supplemented with 2 mm NaVO4, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm leupeptin, 4 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 units/ml aprotinin (lysis buffer). After centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min, cell lysates were added to antibodies (pp125FAK (1 μg of Ig/sample) or IRS-1 (serum dilution 1:50)) preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose (mouse monoclonal antibodies) or protein A-Sepharose (rabbit polyclonal antibodies). Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 4 h for pp125FAK and 2 h for IRS-1. Pellets were then washed three times with buffer A supplemented with 2 mmNaVO4 and resuspended in Laemmli buffer (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp.) in transfer buffer (25 mmTris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3). The membrane was blocked with TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl) containing 5% bovine serum albumin (w/v) for 1 h and incubated with antibodies to pp125FAK (1:200), IRS-1 (1:1000), p85α (1.6 μg/ml), GRB2 (1 μg/ml), SHP-2 (2 μg/ml), p42 MAP kinase (0.5 μg/ml), phospho-MAP kinase (1 μg/ml), or phosphotyrosine (1 μg/ml) for 90 min at room temperature. When necessary, an incubation with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins was performed for 1 h at room temperature. After each incubation, the membrane was washed four times with TBS containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and then twice with TBS. The membrane was finally incubated with125I-protein A (250,000 cpm/ml) or with chemiluminescent antibodies (enhanced chemiluminescence, Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature; washed five times with TBS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and twice with TBS; and exposed to sensitive films. The mammalian two-hybrid system was purchased from CLONTECH. It contains two expression vectors, pM and pVP16. The reporter vector pE1bLUC was kindly provided by Richard A. Maurer. pM expression vector contains the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Gal4, and the other vector contains the VP16 activation domain (AD). We subcloned the cDNAs of the proteins of interest in-frame downstream of the DBD or the AD. The cDNAs were first amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the Pwo DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) with different sets of primers: IRS-1, 5′-ACG CGT CGA CGT ATG GCG AGC CCT CCG CCG G-3′ and 5′-CCCAAG CTT CTA TTG ACG GTC CTC TGG TTG-3′; ΔPTB-IRS-1, 5′-GGA ATT CAT GGC GAG CCC TCC GGA TAC CG-3′ and 5′-CCCAAG CTT CTC CCC TGC CTC TCC GAC GCC-3′ for the N-terminal extremity, and 5′-CCC AAG CTT GGT TCC TTC AGG GTG CGT G-3′ and 5′-CCC-AAG CTT CTA TTG ACG GTC CTC TGG-3′ for the C-terminal part; ΔPH-IRS-1, 5′-GCG-CGT CGA CAT AAT CGG GCA AAG GCC CAC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAG CTT CTA TTG ACG GTC CTC TGG-3′; pp125FAKand pp125FAK-KD, 5′-CGC GGA TCC GTA TGG AGC GTT CCC CGG GGG CC-3′ and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TTA GTG GGG CCT GGA CTG GC-3′; constitutively active c-Src, 5′-CCG GAA TTC CGG ATG GGG AGC AGC AAG AGC-3′ and 5′-CCG GAA TTC CGG CTA TAG GTT CTC TCC AGG-3′. The restriction sites are underlined. Inserts and vectors pM and pVP16 were digested with the corresponding enzymes, and ligation was performed using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit from Boehringer Mannheim. pM/pp125FAK-ΔC, pM/βIR, and pVP16/p85α were obtained by excising pp125FAK-ΔC, IR β-subunit (βIR), and p85α cDNAs from pBTM116/pp125FAK-ΔC, PCDNA3/βIR, and pLex/p85α, respectively, and religated in-frame into pM vector or pVP16 vector using appropriate enzymes. All the constructions were verified by sequencing the open reading frame between the AD or the DBD and the insert (T7 sequence kit, Pharmacia, and SEQUAGEL, National Diagnostic, Atlanta, GA). Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS and 500 μg/ml Geneticin. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (500 ng of each expression vector and 100 ng of reporter vector/17-mm diameter dish). 18 h after being transfected, cells were starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FCS for 20 h. 36 h after transfection, cells were solubilized in 100 μl of Reporter lysis buffer from Promega (Madison, WI). 10 μl of cell lysate was used to measure the luciferase activity with 50 μl of luciferin substrate purchased from Promega. Substrate degradation was followed by production of photons, and this chemiluminescent reaction was measured using a luminometer. To measure PI 3-kinase activity, 293 cells were transfected with pp125FAK, IRS-1, or both and were stimulated or not stimulated with 10−6m insulin for 5 min. Cells were washed with buffer A, supplemented with 2 mmNaVO4, and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer, and cell extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with pp125FAK (1 μg of Ig/sample) or IRS-1 antibodies (serum dilution 1:50). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with each of the following buffers: 1) phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Nonidet P40; 2) 100 mm Tris, 0.5 m LiCl, pH 7.4; and 3) 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.4 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, and the kinase reaction was started by the addition of l-α-phosphatidylinositol (0.2 mg/ml), 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol) and was performed for 15 min at room temperature. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 4 m HCl, and the phosphoinositides were extracted with 130 μl of chloroform/methanol (v/v). The phospholipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and Cerenkov counting. We have set up a two-hybrid system in mammalian embryonic kidney cells, 293 cells (Fig. 1). We used pM and pVP16 vectors (CLONTECH) and the reporter vector pE1bLUC obtained from R. Maurer. The pM vector contains the SV40 promoter followed by the sequence coding for the DBD of Gal4. The pVP16 vector is similar to pM but contains the AD of VP16 instead of the DBD of Gal4. The pM and pVP16 polylinkers are located, respectively, downstream of the DBD or the AD, and the proteins of interest are subcloned in-frame with these domains. The reporter vector pE1bLUC contains five copies of the upstream activation sequence to which the DBD of Gal4 binds upstream of the luciferase cDNA. Interaction between proteins of interest reconstitutes a functional transcription factor (DBD Gal4/AD VP16) and allows transcription of luciferase. Hence, the interaction is quantified by a luminometric measurement of luciferase activity. 293 cells were transfected with the reporter vector pE1bLUC, pp125FAK-WT, or several mutants subcloned into pM and constitutively active c-Src subcloned into pVP16. Direct interaction between the proteins was revealed by a luminometric assay, and results have been calculated as a function of the mock condition (Fig. 2). The mock condition is the highest basal luciferase activity given by either the construct in pM or the construct in pVP16 alone. As shown in Fig. 2, and in accordance with previous reports of co-immunoprecipitations (18Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 19Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we found in our mammalian two-hybrid system that wild-type pp125FAKinteracted with c-Src. More precisely, interaction between pp125FAK and c-Src induced a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the mock condition. Since it is known that c-Src binds to the autophosphorylated tyrosine 397 of pp125FAK, our observations suggest that the kinase activity of pp125FAK is functional in our mammalian system. This was further confirmed using the kinase-deficient mutant of pp125FAK (obtained by mutation of lysine 454 in the ATP binding site), which did not associate with c-Src. Next we looked at the possible participation of another domain of pp125FAK. The pp125FAK mutant deleted of the C-terminal domain (Δ aa 965–1065) interacted with c-Src to the same extent as wild-type pp125FAK. This is expected, since the c-Src binding site is not included in the deleted part. In summary, our mammalian two-hybrid system is able to detect the interaction between pp125FAKand constitutively active c-Src. This interaction is subject to modulation by changes in the structure and kinase activity of pp125FAK. Taken together, our results confirm the validity of this mammalian system. The cDNAs of pp125FAK or the βIR were subcloned into pM. The cDNAs of IRS-1 or the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase (p85α) were subcloned into pVP16. 293 cells were transfected with pE1bLUC, pM/βIR, and pVP16/IRS-1; pM/pp125FAK and pVP16/p85α; or pM/pp125FAK and pVP16/IRS-1. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3, we found that pp125FAK and IRS-1 interact strongly in this system, since their coexpression led to a 48-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the mock condition. This is the first evidence demonstrating a direct molecular interplay between these two molecules. Moreover, coexpression of βIR and IRS-1 led to a 15-fold increase in luciferase activity, indicating that the two proteins interact in our mammalian system. Such interaction has been previously demonstrated using the classical yeast two-hybrid system (45Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Gamha A. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Indeed, IRS-1 contains a PTB (aa 144–318), which binds to phosphotyrosine 960 of βIR (46Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), pp125FAK interacts directly with p85α, since we found a 20-fold increase in luciferase activity when pp125FAK and p85α are coexpressed. The interactions between pp125FAKand p85α, and between IRS-1 and βIR, indicate that these proteins are functional and correctly expressed in 293 cells. Next, we searched for the domains of pp125FAK and IRS-1 potentially involved in the interaction between the two molecules. Neither pp125FAK nor IRS-1 contains SH2 or SH3 domains (35Sun X.J.

Fetal epidermis comprises a single cell layer at day 14 (E14)1 in the mouse. By E18, a stratified, squamous epithelium is formed, comprising five cell layers (1Bickenbach J.R. Greer J.M. Bundman D.S. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 405-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The appearance of differentiating (suprabasal) keratinocytes in fetal epidermis is characterized by the sequential expression and post-translational processing of keratins and other differentiation-specific proteins, which form cornified cell envelopes in terminally differentiated keratinocytes. The biochemical mechanisms underlying these remarkable structural changes, the keratinization and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, are largely unknown. We identified a cytochrome P450 (CYP gene superfamily) in fetal mouse skin, CYP2B19, that is a new and novel cellular marker for differentiated keratinocytes. Mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes are monooxygenases that metabolize small, hydrophobic compounds including steroids, sterols, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, drugs, and toxins (2Nebert D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1203-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recombinant CYP2B19 metabolizes arachidonic acid, a normal constituent of cellular membranes and the precursor of biologically active lipids such as epoxyeicosatrienoic (EET) acids, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic (HETE) acids, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and prostaglandins. Normal fatty acid metabolism is critical to the permeability barrier function of the epidermis. Scaling epidermal lesions, abnormal keratinocyte differentiation, and chronic hyperproliferation are associated with abnormal levels of fatty acids including arachidonate; these skin phenotypes can be induced by dietary essential fatty acid deficiency (3Feingold K.R. Adv. Lipid Res. 1991; 24: 57-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Williams M.L. Semin. Dermatol. 1992; 11: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar) or skin disease, such as psoriasis (5Hammarström S. Hamberg M.

Cytochrome P450 arachidonic acid monooxygenases are present in many mammalian tissues where they comprise the only known enzymatic sources of regioisomeric EETs. Murine epidermis appears to utilize a unique, keratinocyte-specific arachidonic acid monooxygenase (CYP2B19) that generates EETs and HETEs. CYP2B12, a homologous cytochrome P450 in rat skin, is also an arachidonic acid monooxygenase. Like CYP2B19 it is keratinocyte-specific but generates only EETs from arachidonate (7Friedberg T.

Expression data indicate that the catalytic activities of these two enzymes are highly compartmentalized to the most differentiated, viable cell layers in the epidermis (granular cells), hair follicles (inner root sheath), or sebaceous glands (sebocytes). The P450-mediated bioactivation of arachidonate generates eicosanoids that may function in vasomodulation (EETs and 19- and 20-HETE) in vascular tissues or as secretagogues (EETs) for neuroendocrine cells (9McGiff J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol Toxicol. 1991; 31: 339-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 10Capdevila J.H. Zeldin D. Karara A. Falck J.R. Adv. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 14: 317-339Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism of action of EETs was demonstrated in endothelial cells where EETs activate ion channels and effect increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations (11Baron A. Frieden M. Bény J.-L. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). While EETs or their enzymatic source have not been studied previously in cutaneous tissues, a physiological role involving ion transport or Ca2+-dependent signaling in keratinocytes must be considered since Ca2+ is a key regulator of keratinocyte differentiation in vitro (12Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1207-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ gradient maintained in the epidermis in situ also suggests a regulatory role for this cation in vivo, extracellular and intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations are greatest in the granular cell layer where CYP2B19 is expressed and lowest in the basal cell layer (13Menon G.K. Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated as described (14Keeney D.S. Ikeda Y. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1091-1098Google Scholar). For reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), total RNA was primed with oligo(dT)16, reverse-transcribed and amplified using a GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer). CYP2B subfamily-specific oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Table I) were used to screen embryonic RNAs. The PCR products were size-fractionated on agarose gels, visualized with ethidium bromide, subcloned, and DNA sequenced.

Tissue preparation and in situ hybridization methods were described (14Keeney D.S. Ikeda Y. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1091-1098Google Scholar). Specific hybridization was distinguished by comparing silver grain development produced by sense and antisense cRNAs applied to consecutive sections on the same slide. For Northern analyses, total RNA was size-fractionated on formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels and transferred by capillarity to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont). Membranes were baked at 80 °C and stained with methylene blue to assess RNA integrity. The following murine cDNAs were used forin vitro transcription to generate [35S]UTP-labeled cRNAs for in situhybridization or were random labeled with [32P]dCTP for Northern blot analyses: CYP2B19 (GenBank accession number AF047529, 558–981 and 2381–2639 bp), keratin 10 (number V00830, 1727–1944 bp), keratin 14 (number M13806, 681–1063 bp), loricrin (number M34398, 1518–1684 bp), profilaggrin (number J03458, 12–188 bp), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (number X64414, 2109–2272 bp). For Northern data analyses, radioactivity on the washed membranes was quantitated using a PhosphorImager and the volume integration method of ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). In every sample lane, the relative counts (average from two scans) corresponding to each radiolabeled cDNA were normalized for those corresponding to cyclophilin mRNAs (PstI-BamHI fragment of p1B15) (15Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA. 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The data are reported as % of the 0 h control value for each experimental treatment. One × 106 plaques of a whole mouse skin (adult female C57B/6) cDNA library (Stratagene) were screened by plaque hybridization. A 595-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′-end (exonic) of CYP2B19 was generated by RT-PCR and randomly labeled with [32P]dCTP for hybridization. Secondary and tertiary screening resulted in five positive plaques. The cDNA inserts were sequenced, including both strands of clone 2-1B-1A. A full-length CYP2B19 cDNA (pBS2B19; clone 2-1B-1A) was modified as described (16Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, the 3′-untranslated sequence of CYP2B19 was shortened by PCR mutagenesis using oligonucleotides 7 and 8 (Table I). This antisense oligo contains a KpnI site, for ligation back into pBS2B19 and an adjacent, internal XbaI site for subsequent ligation into pCWori+. The PCR product (635 bp) was restricted withHindIII and KpnI, and a 200-bp fragment containing the stop codon was purified and ligated back into pBS2B19. Next, the first seven residues of native CYP2B19 were changed to MALLLAV by PCR mutagenesis using oligonucleotides 9 and 10. The PCR product (750 bp) was restricted with BamHI and NcoI, and a 140-bp fragment containing the modified N terminus was purified and ligated back into pBS2B19. Finally, pBS2B19 modified at both ends was restricted with NdeI and XbaI, producing a 1.5-kb fragment, which was ligated into pCWori+. By DNA sequence analysis, pCW2B19 contained the entire open reading frame of CYP2B19, the N-terminal MALLLAV modification, and 25 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. Competent Escherichia coli cells (Topp3 strain; Stratagene) were transformed with pCW2B19 and grown as described (16Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) for 48–72 h (29 °C, 125 rpm) in media supplemented with δ-aminolevulinic acid (0.5 mm, final concentration). Spheroplasts were prepared as described (16Barnes H.J. Arlotto M.P. Waterman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Buffers for subsequent purification contained potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) at the indicated molarity, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EDTA. Spheroplasts were resuspended (5 ml/g wet weight; 10 mm buffer, 30% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μM arachidonate, 1 μg/ml DNase I). Triton X-114 was added to 0.7% final concentration, and the solubilized bacterial membranes were isolated by phase separation (18Halkier B.A. Sibbesen O. Møller B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 272: 268-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytochrome P450 fraction was diluted 4-fold (10 mmbuffer, 20 μM arachidonate, 0.2% Triton X-100) and loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) column. Void fractions were applied to a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad), which was equilibrated with 1 mm buffer containing 20 μM arachidonate and 0.1% Triton X-100, and eluted with 400 mm buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Heme-containing fractions (A 418 nm) were pooled, diluted 10-fold, and further purified using a flavodoxin-Sepharose affinity column followed by hydroxylapatite as described (19Jenkins C.M. Pikuleva I. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Heme-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed (100 mm buffer, 0.3% sodium cholate), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Arachidonate monooxygenase activity was assayed as described (20Capdevila J.H. Falck J.R. Dishman E. Karara A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Partially purified CYP2B19 was reconstituted in the presence of [1-14C]arachidonic acid (50 μCi/μmol; 50 μM final concentration). Organic extracts of the reaction mixtures were resolved by reversed-phase HPLC with on-line liquid scintillation detection. Radioactive fractions containing metabolites were collected and analyzed on different chromatographic systems (reversed-phase, normal phase or chiral columns) to identify analytes (21Capdevila J.H.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Endogenous EETs were measured in fresh frozen murine epidermis. Whole skins from 15 neonatal mice were frozen flat on solid CO2 and scraped with a razor blade. An accurate wet weight measurement of the pooled, scraped epidermis was not obtained because of frozen water vapor in the sample. Tissue was extracted in the presence of triphenylphosphine, and the content of 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-EET was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry as described (21Capdevila J.H. Dishman E. Karara A. Falck J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from 2–3-day-old mice as described (23Dlugosz A.A. Glick A.B. Tennenbaum T. Weinberg W.C. Yuspa S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in complete keratinocyte growth medium (Medium 154XP, Cascade Biologics) containing 0.05 mm Ca2+ and 1% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum (1 pup equivalent/two 100-mm dishes). The cultures were fed on the third day and every other day thereafter with the same medium (no serum). In 6–7 days when the cultures were 75–85% confluent, treatments were initiated with fresh growth medium (no serum) containing 0.125 mm Ca2+ to induce differentiation. Some cultures were treated with higher Ca2+ concentrations or other divalent cations in the presence of 0.05 mm Ca2+ where indicated. Finally, some cultures (in 0.05 mm Ca2+) were treated with platelet activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-glycerophosphocholine) (Sigma), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma), or vehicle (0.1% ethanol). Control cultures were maintained in 0.05 mmCa2+. At timed intervals after initiating treatments (0 h), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Attached cells were lysed in 1.5 ml of guanidinium thiocyanate. Cells in the wash were collected by centrifugation, lysed with 0.5 ml guanidinium thiocyanate, pooled with the attached cell lysates, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Mouse embryo RNAs were screened by RT-PCR to identifyCYP genes expressed during fetal development. Degenerate oligonucleotides specific for mammalian CYP2B genes amplified a fragment of a novel gene, Cyp2b19, with RNA isolated from developing limbs (E15.5). This nucleotide sequence was more closely related to two rat genes, CYP2B12 (7Friedberg T. Grassow M.A. Bartlomowicz-Oesch B. Siegert P. Arand M. Adesnik M. Oesch F. Biochem.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), than to previously identified murine genes. Authenticity of this partial cDNA was confirmed by the specific hybridization of antisense CYP2B19 cRNA to fetal mouse epidermis (E15.5; Fig. 1 A). In serially sectioned mouse embryos, specific hybridization was not observed with any other tissue or organ. Silver grains representing CYP2B19 mRNA localized to the uppermost suprabasal cells (Fig. 1, B and C), the most differentiated keratinocytes in this immature (E16.5) epithelium. Specific hybridization was not observed in basal cells or in many of the intermediate cells. Temporally, CYP2B19 mRNA was first detected at E15–E15.5, coincident with the appearance of suprabasal cells in fetal epidermis. Expression levels appeared to increase proportionately with increases in the number of differentiated keratinocytes, as the epidermis thickens between E15 and term (≈E19). Spatially, CYP2B19 is expressed in the same cellular layer as loricrin, a marker of late differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes (granular cell layer) (1Bickenbach J.R. Greer J.M. Bundman D.S. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 405-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Loricrin mRNAs localized to the most differentiated (uppermost) suprabasal cells in fetal (E16.5) epidermis (Fig. 1, D and E). Considering its much higher expression level than CYP2B19, relatively few silver grains representing loricrin mRNA were present over intermediate cells. A different pattern was observed for keratin 10, a marker of newly differentiating keratinocytes (spinous cell layer) (1Bickenbach J.R. Greer J.M. Bundman D.S. Rothnagel J.A. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 405-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Keratin 10 was expressed at moderately high and uniform levels in all suprabasal cells (Fig. 1, F and G). None of these mRNAs were detectable in basal cells. These data demonstrate that CYP2B19, like loricrin, is a specific marker for the most differentiated, nucleated keratinocytes in murine epidermis. The coincident onset of CYP2B19 expression and the appearance of loricrin-expressing suprabasal keratinocytes suggest a function for this cytochrome P450 enzyme in the stratification stage during development of fetal mouse epidermis. Sequence analyses of RT-PCR-generated CYP2B clones led to identification of low levels of CYP2B10 mRNA in mouse skin (not shown). CYP2B10 is a predominant CYP2B in mouse liver having 16-hydroxylase activity with androgens, like testosterone (25Noshiro M. Lasko M. Kawajiri K. Negishi M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6434-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CYP2B10 mRNAs were represented in the mouse skin cDNA library, so a CYP2B19 hybridization probe and stringency conditions were chosen to minimize cross-hybridization with CYP2B10. Several CYP2B19 cDNA clones were isolated (Fig. 2) that contained the novel CYP2B sequence originally amplified from mouse embryo RNA. Except for a missing ATG start codon, clone 2-1B-1A is full-length (2.7 kb). It contains an open reading frame encoding a 492-amino acid protein, 1.2 kb of 3′-untranslated sequence, and a polyadenylated tail. A start codon was likely missing because the second codon contains an EcoRI site, the same restriction site used to prepare the cDNA library. An ATG start codon was found in a 2-kb clone (5-2A-1A) containing the first 0.96 kb of the open reading frame, up to the putative exon 6/7 boundary. Exon/intron boundaries are conserved within CYP gene subfamilies (26Gotoh O. Omura T. Ishimura Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Cytochrome P- 450. 2nd Ed. Kodansha, Tokyo1993: 207-233Google Scholar). The remainder of this clone might encode intron 6 because the next 50 bp are 90% identical to intron 6 of CYP2B15 (24Nakayama K. Suwa Y. Mizukami Y. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Only the first 50 bp of the 5′-end of this intron have been reported. Sequence data obtained beyond this point were unrelated to sequences in GenBank, except for 300 bp of the 3′-end which were identical to phage λlacZ transcript. Clone 5-2A-1A had another alteration, a 31-bp insertion at the presumed exon 1/2 boundary that would cause a frameshift. A third 2.3-kb clone (7-1A-1A) lacked the first 0.5 kb of open reading frame. It was otherwise identical to clone 2-1B-1A except for an extra 8 bp (CCTTGCTT) immediately preceding a polyadenylated tail. By DNA sequence analysis, these three overlapping clones represent a single 2.7-kb transcript encoding CYP2B19. Murine CYP2B19 is 87 and 86% identical to rat CYP2B12 and rat CYP2B15, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences (Fig. 3) of these three homologous enzymes are typical of cytochromes P450. They are unremarkable except for residue 24, located near the end of the N-terminal, membrane-spanning region and preceding the conserved proline-rich region (27Yamazaki S. Sato K. Suhara K. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 652-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This residue is present in CYP2B19, CYP2B15, and CYP2B12 but is absent (gapped) in all other CYP2Bs, in alignments generated by multiple sequence comparisons. While the functional significance of this “extra” residue is unknown, there is a strict correlation between its presence and keratinocyte-specific expression. Hence, this residue may serve as a signature of keratinocyte-specific CYP2B monooxygenases. The striking sequence identities among CYP2B19, CYP2B15, and CYP2B12 led us to compare their expression patterns throughout development. All three genes were found to be uniquely expressed in differentiated, skin keratinocytes (Table II). Data for rat CYP2B12 have been reported (8Keeney D.S. Skinner C. Wei S. Friedberg T. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9279-9284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the expression patterns of CYP2B15 are identical to those of CYP2B19, the results in Fig. 4 are equally applicable to CYP2B19 in mouse skin and CYP2B15 in rat skin. CYP2B19 and CYP2B15 are expressed not only in fetal epidermis, but throughout all stages of postnatal development, in both sexes. The only notable difference between these species is that epidermal CYP2B15 mRNA levels in rat skin appeared to diminish somewhat in adulthood. In adult mouse skin (Fig. 4,A and B), CYP2B19 mRNAs localized to the differentiated keratinocytes of three cutaneous structures: suprabasal cells in the epidermis, sebocytes in sebaceous glands, and the inner root sheath of hair follicles. While epidermal CYP2B19 expression was first detected at E15–E15.5, follicular and sebaceous expression were first detected in neonatal skin. These skin appendages develop morphologically during the first week of postnatal development in rodents.Table IISummary of unique attributes of three keratinocyte-specific CYP monooxygenases in skin, murine CYP2B19, rat CYP2B15, and rat CYP2B12GeneExpression patternsActivitiesConstitutiveEpidermisHair folliclesSebaceous glandsSubstrateMetabolitesCyp2b19YesYesYesYesArachidonic acidEETs and HETEsCYP2B15YesYesYesYesND2-aND, not determined.NDCYP2B12 2-bData reported in Ref. 8.YesNoNoYesArachidonic acidEETs2-a ND, not determined.2-b Data reported in Ref. 8Keeney D.S.

Open table in a new tab In rat skin (Fig. 4, C and D), CYP2B15 localized to suprabasal cells in the epidermis and sebocytes in the preputial gland, the large paired sebaceous glands beneath the genital skin of rodents. Sectioned close to the midline, sebaceous tissue expressing CYP2B15 is shown surrounding a central collecting duct that directs the flow of sebum to the skin surface. Sebocytes in other types of sebaceous glands also express CYP2B15: meibomian glands in the eyelid, anal glands in anogenital skin, and sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles (not shown). A serially sectioned rat vibrissae follicle (Fig. 4, E and F) shows a single layer of CYP2B15-expressing keratinocytes, which outlines the hair canal. An adjacent section cut obliquely (Fig. 4 G) exposes a relatively large surface of inner root sheath expressing CYP2B15. The tissue distribution of CYP2B19 and CYP2B15 was analyzed by RT-PCR. For CYP2B19 mRNAs in mouse tissues, products of expected size were obtained using RNAs isolated from all cutaneous tissues examined, but not from mouse adrenal gland, ovary, testis, vesicular gland, uterus, liver, lung, kidney, small intestine, colon, caecum, spleen, brain, heart, tongue, tibia, or femur (not shown). No products were observed in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Similar results were obtained for CYP2B15 mRNAs in rat tissues. Products of expected size were amplified with RNA isolated from all cutaneous tissues examined, but not from rat adrenal gland, ovary, uterus, heart, liver, kidney, or spleen (not shown). In situ hybridization studies also confirmed that CYP2B19 is not detectable in the keratinocytes of mucosal epithelia such as the rectum, colon, vagina, uterus, cornea, and conjunctiva (not shown). Hence, CYP2B19 and CYP2B15 appear truly specific for skin keratinocytes. CYP2B19 and CYP2B15 are predicted to be orthologous because their expression patterns are indistinguishable and their 3′-untranslated sequences are more identical to each other than to that of CYP2B12. Importantly, CYP2B12 expression patterns differ (8Keeney D.S. Skinner C. Wei S. Friedberg T. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9279-9284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Table II), being limited to sebocytes, a subset of differentiated skin keratinocytes. The inability to detect epidermal and follicular CYP2B12 expression byin situ hybridization further suggests that the orthologues will be CYP2B19 and CYP2B15. Arachidonic acid was demonstrated to be a substrate for recombinant CYP2B19. Turnover numbers estimated for CYP2B19 with [1-14C]arachidonic acid averaged 3.5 min−1 (Fig. 5 A). Metabolites generated by CYP2B19 were resolved by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 5 B). Five fractions (P1–P5) were collected and analyzed further, and characterized structurally (Table III). All five P450 metabolites were produced enantioselectively, attesting to their enzymatic origin. Fraction P5 had the same retention time in reversed-phase HPLC as a mixture of authentic 11,12- and 8,9-EET. Further analysis confirmed that P5 contained only 11,12-EET and that the major enantiomer was 11S,12R-EET. Fraction P4 had the same retention time as authentic 14,15-EET and contained nearly exclusively 14S,15R-EET. Fraction P3 contained a mixture of 11-, 12-, and 15-HETE, in which the predominant enantiomers were 11S-, 12R-, and 15R-HETE. The radioactive material in P1 had a retention time similar to that of a mixture of dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids and likely arose by hydration of the EETs. The radioactive material in P2 remains to be identified. Importantly, ω- or ω-1 hydroxylated arachidonic acids were not detected. In summary, EETs accounted for approximately two-thirds of the identified metabolites, while HETEs accounted for the remaining one-third. Significantly, CYP2B19 is the first cytochrome P450 identified in skin that generates 12R-HETE"

Small amino-terminal segments (TAF N-terminal domain (TAND)) of DrosophilaTAFII230 (dTAFII230) and yeast TAFII145 (yTAFII145) bind strongly to TBP and inhibit TBP-DNA interactions. yTAFII145 TAND (yTAND) was divided into two subdomains, yTANDI10–37 and yTANDII46–71, that function cooperatively.

Transcription of protein coding genes in eukaryotes is carried out by RNA polymerase II and a set of auxiliary initiation factors (1Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). These factors, including TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, can be assembled in a combinatorial fashion in vitro to form a preinitiation complex. Recently, it was proposed that most of these factors are preassembled in vivo in the form of holoenzyme and recruited as a single complex to the core promoter to initiate transcription (3Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 4Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Barberis et al. (5Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that recruitment of holoenzyme via a fortuitous interaction between GAL4 DNA binding domain and GAL11 or by fusing lexA to GAL11 would suffice for gene activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A similar result was obtained for SRB2, another component of holoenzyme (6Farrell S. Simkovich N. Wu Y. Barberis A. Ptashne M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2359-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is evidence that TBP binding to the TATA box is also a rate-limiting step for transcriptional activation that can be accelerated by gene-specific activators (7Klein C. Struhl K. Science. 1994; 266: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In fact, a physical connection of TBP to a DNA binding module bypasses the requirement for activators (8Klages N. Strubin M. Nature. 1995; 374: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 9Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 10Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Given that TBP is a subunit of TFIID and not a component of holoenzyme (11Wilson C.J. Chao D.M. Imbalzano A.N. Schnitzler G.R. Kingston R.E. Young R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), it appears that recruitment of either TFIID or holoenzyme will suffice for gene activation in yeast (12Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 311-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, it is notable that TFIID is required for both cases because mutation of the TATA sequence greatly decreased activation even by holoenzyme recruitment (5Barberis A. Pearlberg J. Simkovich N. Farrell S. Reinagel P. Bamdad C. Sigal G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1995; 81: 359-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, the question of how activators stimulate transcription has been addressed mostly by biochemical approaches. Particular attention has focused on TFIID, a multiprotein complex composed of TBP and a series of TBP-associated factors (TAFIIs), because TAFIIs were shown to be indispensable for activated transcription in vitro (13Dynlacht B.D. Hoey T. Tjian R. Cell. 1991; 66: 563-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 14Kokubo T. Takada R. Yamashita S. Gong D.-W. Roeder R.G. Horikoshi M. Nakatani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17554-17558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We and others cloned cDNAs encoding TAFIIs from various organisms to decipher the molecular basis of transcriptional regulation (15Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). It is currently known that TAFIIs possess some intriguing structural motifs and/or enzymatic activities. For instance, dTAFII62/dTAFII42 forms a histone octamer-like heterotetrameric structure (16Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). dTAFII230 has multiple enzymatic activities, including a protein serine kinase activity that selectively phosphorylates RAP74 (17Dikstein R. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and a histone acetyltransferase activity specific for histones H3 and H4 (18Mizzen C.A. Yang X.J. Kokubo T. Brownell J.E. Bannister A.J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J. Wang L. Berger S.L. Kouzarides T. Nakatani Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 87: 1261-1270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several TAFIIs were shown to provide interaction sites for distinct activators and general transcription factors (19Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, little is known about how each TAFII is involved in decoding the information sent from activators and how the components of the basal transcriptional machinery communicate with each other to determine the final level of transcription. We previously identified a surprising activity within the amino terminus of dTAFII230/yTAFII145 that strongly inhibits TBP-DNA interactions (20Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Kokubo K. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cumulative evidence plausibly supports the notion that some of the TAFIIs might bear such an inhibitory activity critical for promoter recognition and transactivation (24Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26575-26583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R.

First, TBP-TAFII250-TAFII150 subcomplex discriminates core promoter structures so that it can bind more stably to the DNA that has both TATA sequence and downstream core promoter elements (e.g. initiator) but less stably to the TATA sequence alone (25Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Given that TBP binds equally to the DNA with or without downstream elements, TAFII250 or TAFII150 must negatively regulate TBP binding to the TATA sequence in the absence of downstream elements. In another experiment, the inhibitory effect of TAFII250 on TBP-mediated basal activity observed for TBP-TAFII250 subcomplex on the HIV or E1B core promoter was specifically antagonized by transcriptional activators (26Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, gel shift and DNase I footprinting studies demonstrated that activators such as GAL4VP16 and Zta facilitate the formation of the TFIID-TFIIA complex on the promoter (28Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 29Kobayashi N. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell.

Importantly, TFIIA and TAFIIs are essential for this enhancement. These findings could be interpreted to indicate that the inhibition of TBP binding to the promoter by TAFIIs (possibly by TAFII250) creates a rate-limiting step during the course of transcription that would be overcome with the aid of both activators and TFIIA (27Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This idea is further supported by our observation that TFIIA can compete with the amino terminus of yTAFII145 for TBP interaction (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Here we designate the aforementioned amino-terminal small portion of TAFIIs that inhibit TBP-DNA interactions specifically as TAF N-terminal domain (TAND) because the corresponding activities seem to be conserved among the species (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar,31Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 1T. Kokubo, unpublished observations. 1T. Kokubo, unpublished observations. We previously demonstrated that yTAFII145 TAND (yTAND) was further divided into two subdomains, yTANDI (10–37 aa) and yTANDII (46–71 aa), that function cooperatively (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas dTAFII230 TAND (dTAND) functioned as a single entity (21Kokubo K. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify dTANDII at 118–143 aa, neighboring the previously identified dTAND (hereafter called dTANDI; 18–77 aa). dTANDII is highly homologous to yTANDII. Intriguingly, however, neither corresponding subdomains of dTAND can function equivalently in vivo to the yeast TANDs, even though they are entirely interchangeable in vitro. Finally, we identify the highly conserved segments within TANDII that are functionally interchangeable in vitro and in vivo. These results have important implications for the molecular interaction between TBP and TAND and its role in transcriptional regulation. Standard yeast genetic techniques were used for the growth and transformation of the yeast strains (32Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1998) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. 2, pp. 13.0.1-13.13.9, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar, 33Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1991: 1-37Google Scholar). Table I lists the S. cerevisiae strains used in this study. All yeast strains are derived from Y22.4 containing a deletion of the chromosomalyTAF II 145 coding region and the wild typeyTAF II 145 gene on a URA3-based low copy number vector (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine the abilities of the yTAFII145 mutants to support yeast cell growth at elevated temperatures, a plasmid shuffle technique was used (34Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R.

Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or yTAND (6–96 aa) in pBluescript II by site-directed mutagenesis (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar). TheBamHI-EcoRI fragment encoding yTAND was subcloned into pGEX2T for expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)2 fusion protein or into pUC19 for the purpose of exchanging TANDs. (Note that BssHII and MluI sites are not unique in pGEX2T or pBluescript II.) Amino acid changes at both sites (i.e. GA to AR at 41–42 aa and EE to TR at 72–73 aa) did not affect the activity in vivo (growth phenotype) or in vitro (TBP binding) (data not shown). To generate the parental template, pM11 (yTAFII145/pRS314), BssHII and MluI sites were created in pYN2 as described above, and the BamHI site in the multicloning sites was disrupted. For constructing pM734 (yTAND (6–96 aa)/pUC19), BssHII and MluI sites were first created in pBluescript II, to make pM5, and then theBamHI-EcoRI fragment was transferred from pM5 to pUC19 as described above. Both pM11 and pM734 have the BamHI site originally at 4–5 aa (near the amino-terminal border of yTANDI). Thus yTANDI could be replaced with a BamHI-BssHII DNA fragment amplified by polymerase chain reaction techniques containing dTANDI (11–80 aa) or dTANDIs (11–114 aa) (s denotes the spacer region). Similarly, yTANDII was replaced with aBssHII-MluI DNA fragment containing dTANDII (116–145 aa). Site-directed mutagenesis (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar) was performed to delete yTANDI from the parental plasmid using oligonucleotide TK43 (5′-TAAAGCAGCAGGGATCCGCGCGCAATTCAAAGGACTATAC-3′). To prepare N-CORE/CORE/C-CORE chimeras, yI-YDY was first constructed from yI-YYY by using oligonucleotide TK42 (5′-AGCATTTGCCGGATGCTATAGATTATTCAGATATAACTGAACTTTCTGAAGACGATGACGATTTGCC-3′). Then, yI-DDY and yI-YDD were constructed from yI-YDY by using TK61 (5′-GCGGGGATGAAGCGCGCGAGGATGGCGCCGTAAAGGCTCAGGACGATGCTATAGATTATTC-3′) and TK62 (5′-CTGAACTTTCTGAAGACTGCCCACGCACTCCGCCCGAAACGCGTTCTGATGCTAA-3′), respectively. yI-DYD was made from yI-DDD by using TK94 (5′-AGGCTCAGGACGATGCCGTAGACTTTGAAGACGAAGATGAGTTAGCTGATGACTGCCCACGCACTCC-3′). The parental plasmids described above were digested withBssHII and MluI and then religated to remove TANDII. Site-directed mutagenesis (35Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4545) Google Scholar) was performed for pM11 (yTAFII145/pRS314) and pM5 (yTAND (6–96 aa)/pBluescript II) to introduce alanine scanning mutations into the yTANDII CORE region. Oligonucleotides used for this purpose were as follows.

TAND derivatives for the protein-protein interaction assay were expressed in Escherichia coli(DH5α) as GST fusion proteins. The cell pellet was suspended in110 culture volume of Buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.2 m KCl and sonicated several times to prepare cell lysates. Lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 15000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. GST-TANDs in the cleared lysates were quantitated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Preparation of yeast TBP and its mutant (K133E/K138E/K145E) was conducted as described previously (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To study interactions between GST-TANDs and TBP, purified TBP (30 pmol) was incubated with bacterial lysate expressing GST-TANDs or GST (30 pmol) in 100 μl of 0.1 m KCl/Buffer D at 4 °C for 30 min, incubated with 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for another 30 min, and washed three times with 500 μl of 0.1 m KCl/Buffer D. The beads were boiled in SDS sample buffer to elute TBP bound to GST-TANDs. Eluates were run on SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. The central portion of yTAFII145 (amino acids 288–489) was expressed in E. coli as a histidine-tagged protein and purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA agarose under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). It was further purified by eluting the corresponding band from the SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The purified protein was then injected into New Zealand White rabbits to prepare specific antiserum. Anti-TBP antibody was prepared in the same way except that the entire coding region of TBP was expressed as an antigen and purified with Ni2+-NTA agarose under nondenaturing conditions. Yeast cells at the log phase were harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold water, and resuspended in cracking buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1 mm EDTA, 8m urea, 5% (w/v) SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 350 ng/ml bestatin, 2 mm benzamidine, 400 ng/ml pepstatin A, 500 ng/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mg/ml BPB) (36Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were sonicated several times and boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. For Western blotting, cell extracts were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-yTAFII145 antibody (37Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Detection of the immune signal was done with the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL Western detection kit. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was conducted as described previously (31Bai Y. Perez G.M. Beechem J.M. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) except using BA/200 extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.6), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 350 ng/ml bestatin, 2 mm benzamidine, 400 ng/ml pepstatin A, 500 ng/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Precipitates were immunoblotted as described above. Gel retardation assays were performed as described previously (20Kokubo T. Gong D.-W. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with affinity purified GST-TAND derivatives and yeast TBP. Adenovirus major late promoter (−119 to +61 of the transcription initiation site) was radiolabeled and used as a probe. We previously demonstrated that yTAND can be divided into two subdomains, yTANDI (10–37 aa) and yTANDII (46–71 aa), both of which are required for full activity (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, we originally identified dTAND (18–77 aa) as a single functional unit (21Kokubo K. Yamashita S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3520-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and noted several other differences between these two TANDs. First, the yTAND-TBP complex is highly salt-sensitive, being disrupted in buffer containing ∼0.3m KCl, whereas the dTAND-TBP complex is resistant to salt concentration up to ∼1.0 m. Second, a TBP mutant (K133E/K138E/K145E), in which three lysines at positions 133, 138, 145 on helix 2 were changed to oppositely charged glutamates, could not interact with TFIIA and yTAND simultaneously. In contrast, it could still bind to dTAND, suggesting that only yTAND shares the interaction surface with TFIIA on TBP. The latter conclusion was verified by biochemical competition analysis (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Given that the interactions between TBP, TAND, and TFIIA are expected to play a significant role in transcriptional regulation, we presumed that they would be conserved between the species. However, obvious sequence similarities were not found between yTAND (10–76 aa) and dTAND (18–77 aa). Thus, we examined these elements more extensively for sequence conservation (Fig. 1,A and B). The region from 125 to 138 aa (DAIDYSDITELSED) outside the originally identified dTAND was found to be significantly similar to the region from 53 to 66 aa of yTANDII (DAVDFEDEDELADD, see Fig. 1 A) (22Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the corresponding region is also conserved in human TAFII250 (Fig. 1 B) (DAVDYSDINEVAED, the region from 106 to 119 aa). Therefore, we hypothesized that dTAND also consists of two subdomains, the minimally conserved dTANDI (18–77 aa; originally identified as dTAND) and more highly conserved dTANDII (118–143 aa) (Fig. 1 A), both of which would be required for full activity. Indeed, the additional stabilizing effect of dTANDII on TBP binding was observed by the biochemical competition analysis (22Nishikawa J. Kokubo T. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We designated the most conserved region in TANDII, composed of 14 amino acid residues, as the core region (CORE; Fig. 1 B). To test this hypothesis more directly, we asked whether dTANDII could substitute for yTANDII in forming a stable TBP-yTAND protein complexin vitro. Toward this end, we produced chimerical GST-TAND fusion proteins in bacteria and used them for GST pull-down experiments with purified recombinant TBP. GST fusions containing only yTANDI (yI), yTANDII (yII), or dTANDII (dII) showed little or no TBP binding activity (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2, 3, and 5). However, the chimerical construct containing yTANDI and dTANDII (yIdII) bound TBP nearly as strongly as did the wild type construct (yIyII) (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1 and 4). Thus we conclude that dTANDII is functionally equivalent to yTANDII for TBP binding in vitro and that a bipartite subdomain structure is conserved in both TANDs. In our previous studies, mutations in the highly conserved core region (CORE) of yTANDII (e.g. Δ54–57 aa) affected the TBP binding activity most severely (23Kokubo T. Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mutations close to the CORE (e.g. Δ46–49 aa) also impaired the activity but to a lesser extent. Sequence similarities between the species were confined to the CORE (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that it is primarily responsible for TBP binding and that other regions of TANDII simply facilitate interaction between the CORE and TBP. To explore this possibility further, we divided TANDII into three subregions, namely, amino-terminal side of the CORE (N-CORE), the CORE itself, and carboxyl-terminal side of the CORE (C-CORE) and constructed the chimeric GST fusion proteins shown in Fig. 2 A. We reasoned that if the N-CORE"

Although it is clear that MHV-3-induced hepatitis depends upon macrophage activation and the expression of a specific prothrombinase,fgl-2, the signaling pathways involved in virally stimulated cell activation are unclear. Since we had previously found that MHV-3 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, we investigated the roles of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins. In a series of Western blots, immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assay studies, we found that both the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK proteins are tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated following exposure of murine peritoneal exudative macrophages (PEM) to MHV-3. Although p38 phosphorylation and activity are induced soon after MHV-3 exposure, peaking by 1–5 min, ERK phosphorylation and activity increase more gradually, peaking at 20–30 min and gradually fading thereafter. Interestingly, whereas selective p38 inhibition with SB203580 (1–20 μm) abolished the virally stimulated induction of fgl-2 mRNA, protein, and functional activity, selective ERK inhibition with PD98059 (1–50 μm) limitedfgl-2 functional activity but had little to no effect onfgl-2 mRNA or protein levels. Moreover, whereas inhibition of ERK had no effect on p38 activity, p38 inhibition consistently increased MHV-3-induced ERK activity. To ensure that these pathways were relevant in vivo, MHV-3 was injected intraperitoneally, and peritoneal exudative macrophages were collected. Again, MHV-3 exposure led to increased p38 and ERK tyrosine phosphorylation. These data argue that MHV-3 induces tightly interconnected ERK and p38 MAPK cascades in the macrophage bothin vitro and in vivo. Although the ERK and p38 MAPK proteins have discordant effects at the level of fgl-2expression, both converge at the level of its activity, suggesting that targeted MAPK inhibition may ultimately be useful in the modulation of viral hepatitis.

Studies using a model of viral hepatitis induced by infection with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3)1 have provided significant insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease and have suggested novel approaches to therapy (1Pappas S.C.

Fulminant hepatitis induced by this virus is characterized by the presence of sinusoidal thrombosis and associated hepatocellular necrosis (3Levy G.A. MacPhee P.J. Fung L.S. Fisher M.M.

These findings occur concomitant with the expression of a virus-induced procoagulant molecule in the sinusoidal lining cells of the liver. This prothrombinase protein, encoded by thefgl-2 gene, has the ability to activate directly the coagulation cascade, an ability expressed as procoagulant activity (PCA) and measured by standard clotting assays (6Parr R.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1789-1795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence suggests that the virus-induced PCA plays a central role in the pathological changes observed in this disease. Following infection with MHV-3, hepatocellular necrosis is seen to occur in regions of sinusoidal fibrin deposition, where concomitant expression of thefgl-2 gene and its protein product is observed in the sinusoidal lining cells (8Ding J.W. Ning Q. Liu M.F. Lai A. Leibowitz J. Peltekian K.M. Cole E.H. Fung L.S. Holloway C. Marsden P.A. Yeger H. Phillips M.J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9223-9230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, other organs simultaneously infected with MHV-3 fail to express Fgl-2 protein and remain uninjured (8Ding J.W. Ning Q. Liu M.F. Lai A. Leibowitz J. Peltekian K.M. Cole E.H. Fung L.S. Holloway C. Marsden P.A. Yeger H. Phillips M.J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9223-9230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, pretreatment with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against MHV-3-induced PCA prevents sinusoidal fibrin deposition, hepatocellular necrosis, and mortality in infected mice (5Li C.

Thus, there is good reason to conclude that an fgl-2up-regulation is essential to the lethal hepatitis induced by MHV-3. These considerations become all the more relevant with the recent discovery of a human fgl-2 analogue (9Ruegg C. Pytela R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which may contribute to inducible endothelial PCA (10Sekiya F. Usui H. Inoue K. Fukudome K. Morita T. J. Biol.

MHV-3 infection of murine macrophages represents an excellent model to study the induction of fgl-2 for several reasons. First, the degree of hepatocellular necrosis following infection correlates well with the induction of macrophage PCA (2Abecassis A. Falk J.A. Makowka L. Dindzans V.J. Falk R.E. Levy G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Li C. Fung L.S. Chung S. Crow A. Myers-Mason N. Phillips M.J. Leibowitz J.L. Cole E. Ottaway C.A. Levy G. J. Exp.

Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5252-5260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages from susceptible mouse strains (Balb/cJ) infected with MHV-3 exhibit a marked increase in PCA, whereas those recovered from resistant mice (A/J) fail to do so (13Chung S. Gorczynski R. Cruz B. Fingerote R. Skamene E. Perlman S. Leibowitz J. Fung L. Flowers M. Levy G. Immunology. 1994; 83: 353-361PubMed Google Scholar, 14Fingerote R.J. Abecassis M. Phillips M.J. Rao Y.S. Cole E.H. Leibowitz J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 275-4282Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the resistant A/J strains will develop both fulminant hepatitis and macrophage PCA following pretreatment with corticosteroids, which stabilize fgl-2mRNA (14Fingerote R.J. Abecassis M. Phillips M.J. Rao Y.S. Cole E.H. Leibowitz J. Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 275-4282Crossref Google Scholar). Second, administration of exogenous prostaglandin E2 completely abrogates viral induction of macrophage PCA both in vitro and in vivo and prevents the development of fulminant hepatitis (2Abecassis A. Falk J.A. Makowka L. Dindzans V.J. Falk R.E. Levy G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 15Chung S.W. Sinclair S.B. Fung L.S. Cole E.H. Levy G.A. Prostaglandins. 1991; 42: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Considered together, these findings suggest that macrophage PCA may serve both as a marker of disease and contribute to the pathogenesis of the process by virtue of the ability of the cells to sequester in the infected liver. The cellular mechanisms underlying the induction of this protein in macrophages as well as in other cells are presently being defined. Detailed studies by Holmes and colleagues (16Dveksler G.S. Dieffenbach C.W. Cardellichio C.B. McCuaig K. Pensiero M.N. Jiang G.S. Beauchemin N. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Nedellec P. Dveksler G.S. Daniels E. Turbide C. Chow B. Basile A.A. Holmes K.V. Beauchemin N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4525-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have characterized the MHV receptor as a 110–120-kDa glycoprotein in the carcinoembryonic antigen family of glycoproteins. Expression of this receptor in hamster cell lines confers susceptibility to MHV infection (17Nedellec P. Dveksler G.S. Daniels E. Turbide C. Chow B. Basile A.A. Holmes K.V. Beauchemin N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4525-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent events in the signaling pathway(s) leading to expression of fgl-2 in MHV-infected macrophages have not been clearly elucidated. Our group previously demonstrated that incubation of macrophages with MHV-3 caused the rapid accumulation of tyrosine phosphoproteins over a range of molecular masses from 33 to 91 kDa. In addition, the nonspecific tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein, herbimycin, and tyrphostin AG51 inhibited virus-induced PCA, both at the functional level and at the level of gene expression (18Dackiw A.P.B. Zakrzewski K. Nathens A.B. Cheung P.Y.C. Fingerote R. Levy G.A. Rotstein O.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that tyrosine kinase activation in response to MHV-3 stimulation is an important component of the signaling cascade leading to fgl-2 expression. In this regard, a clustering of tyrosine phosphorylation around the 38–44-kDa region was suggestive of activation of members of the MAP kinase family, specifically p38/CSBP/reactivating kinase and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK2. These proteins, which undergo dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues during their activation, are known to be involved in the response of cells to a variety of infectious and inflammatory stimuli (19McGilvray I.D.

Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized a role for these proteins in MHV-induced macrophagefgl-2 expression. In the present studies, we demonstrate that MHV-3 induces the phosphorylation and activation of both ERK and p38. However, although both of these kinases are activated, the use of specific inhibitors clearly demonstrates that p38, but not ERK, is integral to the induction of fgl-2 mRNA and its protein product. Pathogen-free female Swiss-Webster mice aged 6–7 weeks were obtained from Taconic Farms and were chow fed and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week prior to experiments. 3% thioglycollate (Life Technologies, Inc.) was prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions. Endotoxin-free RPMI and HBSS were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal calf serum (FCS) was from HyClone. The p38-selective inhibitor SB203580 was the kind gift of Dr. J. C. Lee (SmithKline Beecham) and was prepared in Me2SO to a 20 mm solution. The selective MAP kinase kinase-1 inhibitor PD98059 (Research Biochemicals International) was prepared in Me2SO to a 10 mm stock solution. Peritoneal exudative macrophages (PEM) were harvested in ice-cold HBSS 5–6 days after the intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of sterile thioglycollate. The cells were washed twice in cold HBSS and resuspended in RPMI, 2% FCS, l-Gln at 1–10 × 106 cells/ml. This procedure consistently yields a >96% macrophage cell population by Wright's stain, with >97% viability by trypan blue exclusion (26Brisseau G.F. Dackiw A.P.B. Cheung P.Y.C. Christie N. Rotstein O.D. Blood. 1995; 85: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 prior to experimentation. MHV-3 was obtained and purified as described previously (18Dackiw A.P.B. Zakrzewski K. Nathens A.B. Cheung P.Y.C. Fingerote R. Levy G.A. Rotstein O.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5824-5828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virus was grown to titers of 10–50 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml RPMI on confluent 17CL cells with a strictly aseptic technique. For studies using dead virus, MHV-3 preparations were irradiated under UV light for 20 min (UVG-11 ultraviolet lamp; Ultra-Violet Products Inc.). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence or absence of MHV-3 for times ranging from 1 min to 6 h. Unless otherwise indicated, a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5:1 was employed. In some studies, PEM were preincubated in the presence or absence of 1–50 μm PD98059 or 1–20 μmSB203580 for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Control cells were exposed to vehicle, 0.1% Me2SO, during the preincubation period. At the end of the incubation period, reactions were stopped by placing the cells on ice. PEM were pelleted 6 h after exposure to viral particles and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml RPMI. Following a single freeze-thaw cycle at −70 °C, PCA was measured by single stage recalcification clotting assay. PCA was expressed as milliunits/106 cells by comparison to rabbit brain thromboplastin as described previously (18Dackiw A.P.B. Zakrzewski K. Nathens A.B. Cheung P.Y.C. Fingerote R. Levy G.A.

Levy G.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5252-5260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); for details, see “Results.” At various times after virion exposure, PEM were pelleted and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer. Whole cell lysates were prepared with 2× Laemmli, 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT) buffer followed by immediate boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Cytosolic fractions were isolated with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Postnuclear supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min and diluted with 2× Laemmli buffer, 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT). Lysates prepared from 100,000 cells were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Blots were then probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Laboratories), anti-phospho-ERK or anti-phospho-p38 (New England Biolabs) antibody, or rabbit anti-fgl-2 antibody (Dr. G. Levy, University of Toronto). Following incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blots were developed using an ECL-based system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells (3 × 106) were lysed as above and the postnuclear supernatants precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cellular proteins were immunocomplexed using rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK-2 or anti-p38 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The resulting immune complexes were washed five times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Tween 20, and then separated from beads by 2× Laemmli buffer, 0.1 m DTT and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Beads were then sedimented by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was collected for Western blot analysis. ERK2 or p38 immunocomplexes were washed with 5 changes of cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% Tween 20 and then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μg of ultra-pure myelin basic protein (MBP, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or 5 μg of recombinant activating transcription factor-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), respectively, in kinase assay buffer composed of 0.4 mm cold and 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 2× Laemmli buffer, 0.1 m DTT and boiling at 100 °C for 5 min. Equal volumes were loaded and run on 10% SDS-PAGE. Autoradiograms developed by exposure of the dried gels to Kodak BIOMAX MR film. Total RNA from 10 × 106 PEM was obtained using the guanidinium-isothiocyanate method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 109-113Crossref Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RNA was denatured, electrophoresed through a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membrane. Hybridization was carried out using a32P-labeled, random-primed murine fgl-2 cDNA probe, after which the blots were stripped and probed for 18 S RNA or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA to ensure equal loading. PEM were allowed to adhere to autoclaved glass coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, incubated in the presence or absence of 50 μm PD98059, and then infected with MHV-3 at an m.o.i. of 1. Following a 6-h incubation with the virus, the cells were fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature, quenched for 10 min with 100 mm glycine, and blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% normal goat serum (Sigma) in PBS (pH 7.4). Rabbit anti-Fgl-2 primary antibody was diluted 1:100 in PBS, 1% normal goat serum and incubated with fixed PEM for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with five changes of PBS and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit pAb (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. After five washes in PBS coverslips were mounted using SlowFade antifade reagents (Molecular Probes) and evaluated by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope with Comos 7.0 software. At day 5 following intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate, mice were infected with 50 × 106 virions in 500 μl of RPMI, 2% FCS, l-Gln at 37 °C by intraperitoneal injection. Control animals were injected with 500 μl of medium alone, pre-warmed to 37 °C. At 10, 20, and 30 min after injection of the virus, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and PEM collected by peritoneal lavage using 10 ml of ice-cold HBSS. Cells were immediately placed on ice, sedimented, and prepared for Western blot analysis as described above. Protein amounts were standardized by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) prior to gel loading. Continuous data are represented as the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Where representative studies are shown, these are indicative of at least three equivalent studies performed independently. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey. Two approaches were used to determine whether the ERK MAP kinase was targeted by the response to MHV-3. Fig. 1 A shows the time course of the appearance of tyrosine-phosphorylated p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 in response to MHV-3 stimulation. MHV-3 induced a rise in phospho-ERK as early as 5 min, reaching a peak at 20–30 min, and fading over the ensuing 30 min. As confirmation of this effect, ERK2 was immunoprecipitated and evaluated for tyrosine-phosphorylated residues. As shown in Fig. 1 B, tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 peaked at 20–30 min after exposure to MHV-3 and persisted through 45 min. By having shown the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2, in vitrokinase assays were performed to evaluate its activation (Fig. 1 C). MHV induced ERK2 activation with a time course consistent with its pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation. MHV-3 also induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of p38. Fig. 2, A and B,illustrates the time course of phosphorylation of p38 using the phosphospecific anti-p38 antibody and immunoprecipitation, respectively. It should be noted that in our work and that of others (28Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the p38 MAP kinase migrates at 42 kDa. In contrast to the activation of the ERK pathway, MHV-3 induces a much faster and briefer tyrosine phosphorylation of p38. Phosphorylation was seen as early as 1 min, generally peaking by 1–5 min, and fading over the next 10–20 min. The time course of p38 tyrosine phosphorylation was reflected directly in p38 activity, as revealed by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 2 C). Considered together with the results in Fig. 1, these studies demonstrate that MHV-3 induces both ERK and p38 activation, albeit with markedly different time courses. Although endotoxin (LPS) has been shown to activate both ERK and p38 in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (21Liu M.K. Herrera-Velit P. Brownsey R.W. Reiner N.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2642-2652PubMed Google Scholar, 24Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar), it is very unlikely that LPS contamination contributed to our results for the following reasons. All media and culture materials were endotoxin-free, both by commercial testing and Limulus assay, and strict attention was paid to sterile techniques. Moreover, endotoxin induces a very different pattern of ERK and p38 activation in PEM; a 1 μg/ml dose of Escherichia coli O111:B4 LPS leads to a more profound tyrosine phosphorylation of the ERK1 and ERK2 proteins that persists through 60 min and beyond and induces p38 tyrosine phosphorylation that peaks at 20–30 min and persists to 60 min (data not shown). Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with 50 μg/ml LPS-complexing polymyxin B greatly attenuated LPS-induced PEM activation as assessed by PCA but had no effect on MHV-3-dependent PCA (data not shown). Finally, MHV-3 preparations induced fgl-2expression, whereas LPS does not. Taken together, these results argue that our findings are not due to LPS contamination. Two compounds have recently been described that act as selective inhibitors of the ERK and p38 pathways. PD98059 selectively inhibits MAP kinase kinase-1, the tyrosine kinase immediately upstream of ERK (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2582) Google Scholar), whereas the bicyclic imidazole SB203580 directly inhibits p38 kinase activity (31Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar, 32Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Prior to evaluating the role of these MAP kinases in virus-inducedfgl-2 expression, initial studies were performed to determine the effect of these inhibitors on activation of ERK2 and p38 following MHV-3 stimulation. Pretreatment of cells with PD98059 caused a dose-dependent decrease in ERK2 activity, with complete inhibition of ERK2 activity generally achieved at a 10–50 μm dose (Fig. 3 A), although most consistently at 50 μm. Confirming its selectivity, PD98059 failed to inhibit the MHV-3-induced p38 activation (Fig. 3 B, compare lane 4 to lane 6). Pretreatment of PEM with 10 μm SB203580 markedly attenuated the activation of p38 following treatment with MHV-3 (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig. 3 C, SB20380 did not cross-inhibit ERK2 activation and, in fact, caused a consistent augmentation. Neither inhibitor caused cellular toxicity, as evidenced by >95% trypan blue exclusion after 6 and 24 h of incubation. By having defined the ability of the two agents to inhibit their respective kinase activities following MHV-3 stimulation, studies were performed to evaluate their effect on fgl-2 expression. Fig. 4 A is a representative Western blot examining the effect of PD98059 and SB203580 on Fgl-2 protein in response to MHV-3. At concentrations shown to completely inhibit ERK2 kinase activation, PD98059 had little inhibitory effect on MHV-induced Fgl-2 protein levels. By contrast, SB203580 (20 μm) caused a marked attenuation of Fgl-2 protein expression. Consistent with the effect on Fgl-2 protein, PD98058 failed to reduce the MHV-stimulated increase in fgl-2 mRNA levels, whereas SB203580 caused almost complete inhibition (Fig. 5 presents results obtained with a 20 μm dose of PD98059; doses up to 50 μmfailed to inhibit fgl-2 mRNA). These data therefore suggest that although MHV-3 activates both the ERK and p38 pathways, it appears that only the latter is required for fgl-2expression.Figure 5fgl-2 mRNA expression is selectively abrogated by inhibition of p38 MAP kinase. Following pretreatment with PD98059 (20 μm) or SB203580 (20 μm), PEM were exposed to MHV-3 and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The mRNA from 10 × 106 cells was isolated, separated, and probed forfgl-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Note that although PD98059 had little to no effect on MHV-3-inducedfgl-2 mRNA expression, the increase was blocked by selective p38 MAP kinase inhibition with SB203580. A typical Northern blot is shown and is representative of results obtained in at least four independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W1989720411,"The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/α2MR) mediates the internalization of numerous ligands, including prourokinase (pro-UK) and complexes between two-chain urokinase (tc-u-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). It has been suggested that through its ability to internalize these ligands, LRP/α2MR may regulate the expression of plasminogen activator activity on cell surfaces; this hypothesis, however, has not been experimentally confirmed.

Trophoblasts internalized and degraded exogenous125I-pro-UK (primarily following its conversion to tc-u-PA and incorporation into tc-u-PA·PAI complexes) in an LRP/α2MR-dependent manner, which was inhibited by the LRP/α2MR receptor-associated protein. Receptor-associated protein also caused a ∼50% reduction in cell surface plasminogen activator activity and delayed the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR by cells on which uPAR were initially saturated with pro-UK. Identical effects were caused by anti-LRP/α2MR antibodies.

Furthermore, despite characterization of the processes by which pro-UK and tc-u-PA·PAI-1 complexes bind to and are internalized by LRP/α2MR, an effect of LRP/α2MR on cellular plasminogen activatoractivity has not been demonstrated. To address this, we assessed the effect of LRP/α2MR inhibition on the cell surface plasminogen activator activity of human trophoblast cells, which express both uPAR and LRP/α2MR (30Coukos G.

The expression of LRP/α2MR and VLDL receptors was assessed by immunoblotting and ligand blotting, using RAP as the ligand (42Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The internalization and degradation of125I-pro-UK was measured as described previously (12Kuonnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 2 nm 125I-pro-UK. At various intervals, degraded radioligand was determined by measuring the amount of radioactivity in conditioned medium that remained soluble in 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The amount of 125I-pro-UK bound to the cell surface was determined by measuring the radioactivity within eluates prepared by incubating cells for 3 min in 50 mmglycine-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 3.0 (53Stoppelli M.P.

Specific degradation was defined as the difference between the amount of 125I-pro-UK degraded in the absence and presence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled pro-UK. The effect of RAP or anti-LRP/α2MR antibodies on125I-pro-UK degradation was assessed using the formula, %Inhibition=(A−B)A×100(Eq. 1) where A = specific 125I-pro-UK degradation (cpm), and B = 125I-pro-UK degradation (cpm) in the presence of RAP. The significance of differences between the amount of 125I-pro-UK internalized, degraded, or bound to control and RAP-exposed cells was determined using the Student’s two-tailed t test for paired samples. Cell surface plasminogen activator activity was measured as described by Elliset al. (1Ellis V. Behrendt N. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Ellis V. Scully M.F. Kakkar V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2185-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates and incubated in the absence (HTR 8 cells) or presence (ED 27 and ED 77 cells) of 2 nm pro-UK, for varying intervals. Cells were then washed and further incubated in fresh medium containing 0.2 μm plasminogen and 0.6 mmH-D-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC for 75 min. Plasmin generation was determined by measuring substrate hydrolysis (excitation wavelength, 360 nm; emission wavelength, 460 nm) using a Cytofluor 2300 fluorescence plate reader (Millipore, Bedford MA). To confirm the dependence of this assay on the assembly of pro-UK and plasminogen on the cell surface, we compared the u-PA-dependent activation of plasminogen in the absence and presence of ED 27 cells. Briefly, cells were incubated with 2.0 nm pro-UK and washed, and plasminogen activator activity was measured as described above. In parallel, 0.1 nmpro-UK, a concentration chosen to reflect the amount of pro-UK expected to bind to cellular uPAR under these conditions (based on the affinity of pro-UK binding; Table I), was incubated in empty wells. Concentrated stock solutions of plasminogen and H-D-Val-Leu-Lys-AMC were then directly added to the pro-UK-containing wells to achieve final concentrations equivalent to those in wells containing cells.Table ICharacterization of uPAR, urokinase, and PAI-1 expression by trophoblast cellsCell typeuPA binding (K d)uPARuPA productionPAI-1 productionLRP (ligand blot)nmsites/cellng/106 cells/24 hng/106 cells/24 hED 273.2 ± 0.2259,403 ± 48,823ND16.6 ± 1.7+ED 773.6 ± 0.1205,681 ± 983ND21.2 ± 1.0+HTR 80.7 ± 0.0677,696 ± 12,0492.5 ± 0.443.4 ± 1.9+Data represent the mean ± S.D. of a minimum of three experiments for each reported value.

To determine the effect of RAP on the expression of cell surface plasminogen activator activity by HTR 8 cells (which produce endogenous prourokinase), 4 μl of either phosphate-buffered saline or a 500 μg/ml solution of RAP were added to quadruplicate wells of cells cultured in 96-well plates. Sixteen and 18 h later, a similar amount of RAP was added to each of two additional sets of wells. Medium was then removed, and cell surface plasminogen activator activity was measured. Similar assays were utilized to assess the effect of RAP on the plasminogen activator activity of ED 27 and ED 77 cells. However, because these cells did not produce pro-UK, they were incubated for 6 h with 0, 0.5, or 2.0 nm pro-UK, in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml RAP, prior to measurement of plasminogen activator activity. In selected experiments, the effects of RAP and anti-LRP/α2MR antibodies on cell surface plasminogen activator activity were measured in parallel. To assess the species of 125I-u-PA that accumulated on the surface of cells incubated with 125I-pro-UK and RAP, ED 27 cells were incubated with 4 nm 125I-pro-UK for 30 min and then washed and further incubated, at 37 °C, in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml RAP. Immediately after incubation with 125I-pro-UK, as well as after 4 and 6 h of incubation in the absence or presence of RAP, equal volumes (15 μl) of cell eluates were analyzed in parallel using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (56Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) and autoradiography. Autoradiograms were prepared by exposing dried gels to Reflection™ autoradiography film (New England Nuclear) for 24 h. Bands were quantitated by scanning the autoradiogram into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA) and determining the relative amount of radioactivity within each band by measuring the number of pixels contained within it, using NIH Image, version 1.59. Because RAP-mediated inhibition of ligand uptake by LRP/α2MR might impair the regeneration of uPAR, we assessed the effect of RAP on the expression of unoccupied uPAR by cells on which uPARs were initially saturated with pro-UK. ED 27 cells were incubated with 4 nm unlabeled prourokinase, to saturate cellular uPAR, in the absence or presence of 20 μg/ml of RAP. Cells were then washed, and those initially incubated with pro-UK and RAP or with pro-UK alone were further incubated in fresh medium containing either 20 μg/ml RAP or no additions, respectively. At selected time points (0, 0.5, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 h), cells were chilled to 4 °C and washed, and their expression of unoccupied uPAR was assessed by measuring the binding of 125I-pro-UK. To ensure that RAP had no direct effect on uPAR expression, the expression of unoccupied uPAR by these cells was assessed at selected time points following incubation with RAP alone. In initial studies, the expression of uPAR, u-PA and PAI-1 by the trophoblast cells used in these studies was measured (Table I). All three cell lines expressed uPAR, as demonstrated by their high affinity binding of125I-pro-UK. All cells also produced PAI-1, measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that detects both free and complexed inhibitor. However, u-PA was produced only by HTR 8 cells, and as a consequence, these were the only cells to express cell surface plasminogen activator activity in the absence of added pro-UK. We next determined whether the cells internalized and degraded 125I-pro-UK in an LRP/α2MR-dependent manner. Each of the cell lines internalized and degraded 125I-pro-UK, as demonstrated by the accumulation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in conditioned medium (Fig. 1). The amount of cell surface-associated radioactivity diminished with time, whereas the amount of u-PA within the cells remained relatively constant. Qualitatively similar patterns of 125I-pro-UK degradation were observed for all three cell lines, although HTR 8 cells demonstrated less cell surface-associated and internalized 125I-pro-UK at all time points. This observation is explained by the expression of fewer uPAR by these cells and the fact that HTR 8 cells produced endogenous pro-UK, which would be expected to compete with 125I-pro-UK for binding to uPAR (Table I). Serial analyses of the 125I-pro-UK in conditioned medium over the course of these studies demonstrate that it remained predominantly (>95%) in the single chain form. To determine the role of LRP/α2MR in the internalization and degradation of u-PA by trophoblast cells, the ability of 20 μg/ml (512 nm) RAP to inhibit the degradation of exogenous125I-pro-UK by ED 27 and ED 77 cells was determined. RAP affected the disposition of the radioligand in two ways. First, degradation was inhibited by approximately 75% (Table II), consistent with the results of studies employing other cell types (12Kuonnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, RAP caused the accumulation of significantly (p < 0.001) more radioactivity (∼25%) on the cell surface, an observation not previously reported (Table II). Similar results were obtained using HTR 8 cells (not shown).Table IIEffect of RAP (20 μg/ml) on the disposition of125I-prourokinaseED 27PED 77PDegradation (% added ligand)No RAP10.4 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.1+RAP3.4 ± 0.6<0.0010.8 ± 0.1<0.001Cell surface-associated (% added ligand)No RAP37.1 ± 0.911.7 ± 0.4+RAP44.7 ± 0.5<0.00115.0 ± 0.3<0.001Data represent the mean ± S.D. of a minimum of three experiments for each reported value.

To confirm that these effects were mediated through LRP/α2MR, the effect of RAP on the degradation of125I-pro-UK by ED 77 cells was compared with that of an affinity-purified, anti-LRP/α2MR antibody. Both RAP and the antibody significantly inhibited degradation (Fig. 2 A) and caused similar increases in ce"
https://openalex.org/W2056602961,"We have investigated the mechanisms by which stimulation of cardiac muscarinic receptors result in paradoxical stimulatory effects on cardiac function, using cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes as a model system. Application of low concentrations of carbachol (CCh) (EC50 = 35 nm) produced an atropine-sensitive decrease in spontaneous contraction rate, while, in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin, higher concentrations of CCh (EC50 = 26 μm) elicited an atropine-sensitive increase in contraction rate. Oxotremorine, an m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist, mimicked the negative but not the positive chronotropic response to CCh. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction carried out on mRNA obtained from single cells indicated that ventricular myocytes express mRNA for the m1, m2, and, possibly, m4 mAChRs. The presence of m1 and m2 mAChR protein on the surface membranes of the cultured ventricular myocytes was confirmed by immunofluorescence. The CCh-induced positive chronotropic response was significantly inhibited by fluorescein-tagged antisense oligonucleotides directed against the m1, but not the m2 and m4, mAChR subtypes. The response was also inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides against Gqα protein. Finally, inhibition of CCh-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis with 500 μm neomycin or 5 μm U73122 completely abolished the CCh-induced positive chronotropic response. These results are consistent with the stimulatory effects of mAChR activation on the rate of contractions in cultured ventricular myocytes being mediated through the m1 mAChR coupled through Gq to phospholipase C-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis.

Stimulation of postsynaptic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)1 on cardiac cells is able to produce dual effects on the heartbeat. Classically, stimulation of the vagus nerve or the application of low concentrations of muscarinic cholinergic agonists produces characteristic negative chronotropic and inotropic effects on cardiac tissue and cells (1Hartzell H.C. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1988; 52: 165-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, under appropriate conditions, activation of cardiac mAChRs elicits stimulatory effects on the rate of beating and contractile force of the heart. These latter effects often require higher concentrations of agonist and in some cardiac cell types are only seen after pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTx) (2Endoh M. Tamura K. Hashimoto K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1970; 175: 377-387PubMed Google Scholar, 3Eglen R.M. Montgomery W.W. Whiting R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1988; 247: 911-917PubMed Google Scholar, 4Pappano A.J. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1991; 2: 262-273Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It has been widely believed, based on both radioligand binding techniques as well as Northern blot analyses, that cardiac cells express only the m2 mAChR subtype on their surface membranes (5Maeda A. Kubo T. Mishina M. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 6Entzeroth M. Doods H.N. Mayer N. Arch.

Chen F. Sung T. Hsu H. Wu D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C666-C673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, more recent findings suggest limits in the sensitivity of these techniques in detecting low levels of protein and mRNA (6Entzeroth M. Doods H.N. Mayer N. Arch. Pharmacol. 1990; 341: 432-438Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, it has been demonstrated that mRNA for mAChR subtypes that were missed by Northern blot studies were detected by use of reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in neuroblastoma cells as well as in guinea pig ventricular myocytes (7Gallo M.P. Alloatti G. Eva C. Oberto A. Levi R.C. J. Physiol. 1993; 471: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Steel M.C. Buckley N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 694-701PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work in this laboratory, employing the techniques of single-cell RT-PCR on cardiac myocytes isolated from adult rat ventricle has demonstrated the existence of m1mAChR mRNA in addition to m2 mRNA (10Sharma V.K. Colecraft H.M. Wang D.X. Levey A.I. Grigorenko E.V. Yeh H.H. Sheu S.-S. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Sharma V.K. Colecraft H.M. Rubin L.E. Sheu S.-S. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1023-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the activation of m1mAChRs leads to an increase in muscle shortening and Ca2+transients. However, the signal transduction pathway mediating this stimulatory response is still unknown. Moreover, there is no report on the role of m1 mAChRs in the regulation of heart rate. In the present studies, we have taken advantage of the ability of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes to contract spontaneously and have utilized them as a cardiac cell model system to investigate the role of m1 mAChRs in the regulation of rate of contraction. By applying a number of complementary approaches, including single-cell intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measurements, single-cell RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry and antisense technology, four specific questions were addressed. 1) Do cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes exhibit dual responses to mAChR stimulation in a manner similar to that observed in other cardiac cell preparations? 2) How many subtypes of mAChRs are expressed in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes? 3) Which mAChR subtype mediates the stimulatory effects of muscarinic agonists on the rate of contraction? 4) What second messenger system is involved in generating this response? A preliminary report of this work has appeared in abstract form (12Colecraft H.M. Sheu S.-S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: A392Google Scholar). Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were prepared using modifications of a previously published procedure (13Rogers T.B. Gaa S.T. Allen I.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1986; 236: 438-444PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with ether and decapitated, and their hearts aseptically excised. The bottom half of the hearts were cut, rinsed in magnesium- and calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and finely minced with a pair of scissors. Single cells were obtained by brief alternating periods of enzymatic digestion with 0.125% trypsin and mechanical disaggregation at room temperature. The cells dispersed in the supernatant from the first two digestions were discarded. The supernatant from the following digestions were collected in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 10% calf serum, and 10% horse serum. When all the tissue was digested, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g in a tabletop centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in growth medium and the cells preplated in 10-cm diameter tissue culture dishes. After 2–3 h, unattached cells were plated on 25-mm diameter, circular glass coverslips in 35-mm tissue culture wells (∼1 × 104 cells/well). The cultures were exposed to 3500 rads of γ-irradiation from a cesium source 24 h after the culture. This treatment has been found to limit proliferation of nonmyocardial cells while having little effect on the properties of myocytes (14Lokuta A. Kirby M.S. Gaa S.T. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were washed every second day and used for experiments after 4–14 days in culture. The method for recording of Ca2+transients from single cardiac myocytes has been published previously (10Sharma V.K. Colecraft H.M. Wang D.X. Levey A.I. Grigorenko E.V. Yeh H.H. Sheu S.-S. Circ.

Pharmacol. 1992; 346: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ventricular myocytes cultured on glass coverslips were loaded with the membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl ester form of fura-2 (200 nm fura-2 AM for 10 min) at room temperature in HEPES buffer. The buffer solution contained (mm): NaCl 145, KCl 5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4). After incubation, cells were allowed to sit for >30 min to allow the complete conversion of fura-2 AM to fura-2 free acid. For measurements of [Ca2+]i transients, coverslips with dye-loaded cultured ventricular myocytes were mounted in a tissue chamber on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Single cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm wavelength light from a Xenon-arc UV lamp through a 40× oil immersion objective. The emitted signal at 510 nm was focused onto the photocathode of a photon-counting photomultiplier tube. The signals in response to the two excitation wavelengths were digitized and stored in a microcomputer. All experiments were conducted at 37 °C with continuous perfusion of cells with HEPES buffer containing no drugs (control recordings) or the indicated concentrations of drugs in a final constant bath volume of 1 ml. The method of single-cell RT-PCR was adapted from previously published protocols (10Sharma V.K. Colecraft H.M. Wang D.X. Levey A.I. Grigorenko E.V. Yeh H.H. Sheu S.-S. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Lambolez B. Audinat E. Bochet P. Crepel F. Rossier J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 247-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass micropipettes of the type used for conventional patch clamp studies were fashioned and back-filled with approximately 3 μl of RNase-free water. The micropipettes were used to suck up the contents of single cultured ventricular myocytes identified in culture by the application of a gentle suction. Entry of the cellular contents into the micropipette was monitored under the light microscope. The aspirated cell contents were then extruded into an Eppendorf tube that contained a reverse transcription master mix. The master mix contained: 2 μl of 10× RT buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT) primer. Since the intracellular contents harvested included the nucleus, 1 unit of RNase-free DNase was added to the mixture to remove genomic DNA. Following a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the DNase was inactivated by heating the sample at 95 °C for 5 min and then placing it on ice. Reverse transcription was initiated by the addition of 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by incubation of the sample at 42 °C for 1 h. For negative controls, water was added instead of reverse transcriptase. For the PCR reactions, 4–10 μl of the RT product was added to a reaction solution (50 μl final volume) consisting of: 2–5 mm MgCl2, 5 μl 10× PCR buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm KCl), 0.2 mm each dNTP, 50 pmol of each PCR primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer). The reaction mixture was overlaid with mineral oil and the PCR amplifications carried out in an automated thermocycler for 45–50 cycles (94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min). Ten μl of the PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination.

Briefly, cultured ventricular myocytes were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and subsequently permeabilized with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by preincubating the fixed cells for 30 min with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (GPBS). Cells were then exposed to GPBS, containing either no primary antibody or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the m1 and m2 mAChRs (diluted 1:200; 0.5 μg/ml final concentration) for 48 h at 4 °C. These antibodies have been characterized by immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry using the family of cloned mAChRs as well as receptors expressed in their native tissues (20Levey A.J. Kitt C.A. Simonds W.F. Price D.L. Brann M. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 3218-3226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, excess primary antibody was removed by washing with GPBS and the cells were exposed to a fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, used at 1:500 dilution, for 45 min at room temperature. Following the removal of excess secondary antibody by washing with PBS, the cells were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem). Images were acquired through the use of a confocal microscope. Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to mRNA for the m1, m2, and m4 mAChRs as well as to Gqα and Gsα protein were designed based on their published sequences. Phosphorothioated, 20-mer oligonucleotides synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry and purified by gel filtration were obtained from the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The oligonucleotides were further modified by the addition of a 3′-amino linker arm to allow their labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes). The oligonucleotides were each designed to contain comparable amounts of pyrimidines and purines. The uniqueness of the sequences targeted by each of the oligonucleotides used in this study was determined by comparing the targeted sequence against sequences found in GenBank and other data bases using BLAST (21Altschul S.F.

Briefly, 0.1 μmol of oligonucleotide was incubated with 0.6 μmol of fluorescein isothiocyanate for 18 h in 1 ml of sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9). The reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of 100 mm ammonium chloride, and after another 2 h the fluorescein-tagged oligonucleotide was separated from free fluorescein isothiocyanate by spun column chromatography using Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with deionized water. The labeled oligonucleotides were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2-μm membrane filter and quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (A 260). One A 260unit was taken as being equivalent to 30 μg of oligonucleotide. Antisense oligonucleotides were dispensed from a stock concentration of 100 μm stored at −20 °C. For transfection of cells, 200–500 nm of fluorescein-tagged oligonucleotides and 8 μg/ml Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were each diluted in 100 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prewarmed to 37 °C. The two solutions were then combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For each transfection, 0.8 ml of serum-free medium was added to each tube containing the Lipofectin-oligonucleotide complexes and the resulting mixture overlaid onto the cultured cells. Unless otherwise stated, the cells were incubated with the Lipofectin-DNA complexes for 18 h at 37 °C in a CO2incubator, after which time this solution was removed and replaced with serum-containing normal growth medium. To identify cells with nuclear localization of fluorescein-tagged oligonucleotides, they were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were placed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence. Selected cells were excited with 490 nm wavelength light through a 40× oil immersion objective. The emitted fluorescence images were acquired at 530 nm with a dichroic mirror focused onto a SIT camera. Intracellular organelles such as the nucleus were first identified by phase contrast microscopy and the images thereby attained compared with the fluorescent microscopic pictures to determine the intracellular localization of oligonucleotides. Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, treated with antisense oligonucleotides directed against m1 mAChR mRNA, were probed by immunocytochemistry using m1 and m2 mAChR subtype-specific antibodies and the ABC Elite kit from Vector Laboratories. Briefly, cultured ventricular myocytes were treated with 200 nm antisense oligonucleotides and 8 μg/ml Lipofectin in serum-free culture medium, and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 18 h. At this time, the existing medium was removed and replaced with normal serum-supplemented culture medium. Twenty-four to 48 h later, cells were fixed with a 50% acetone:50% methanol solution for 5 min and subsequently permeabilized and blocked with PBS containing 5% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, and 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then exposed to affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for the m1 and m2 mAChRs (R&D Ab, used at 1:1000 dilution) in GPBS for 24 h at 4 °C. Excess primary antibody was removed by repeated washing with GPBS and the cells were exposed to a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, used at 1:100 dilution, for 1 h at room temperature. Following the removal of excess secondary antibody, the cells were incubated with avidin DH and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H, premixed according to manufacturer's instructions. After washing, cells were stained by incubation for 5 min with a peroxidase substrate solution containing an equal volume of 0.02% hydrogen peroxide and 0.1% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride made in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.2. Following washing and air drying, the cells were placed on coverslips with Mowiol (Calbiochem) and viewed first using fluorescence microscopy to identify nuclear fluorescein staining, and then under the light microscope to examine peroxidase staining. Inositol phosphate (IP1) accumulation was assessed as a measure of phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis using modifications of previously described procedures (25Watson S.P. McConnell R.T. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13199-13203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ventricular myocytes were cultured in 12-well tissue culture dishes for 5 days, at which time the cells were incubated with normal growth medium containing 2 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for another 36 h. The cells were rinsed twice with a physiological saline solution (PSS) which contained (mm): NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 3, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, glucose 10, EDTA 0.5, and HEPES 20 (pH 7.4). The cells were then incubated with 10 mm LiCl in PSS for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with the indicated concentrations of drugs for another 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by removing the PSS bathing the cells, followed by the addition of 0.6 ml of ice-cold methanol to each well. The cells were scraped from the wells and transferred to centrifuge tubes, to each of which was added 0.3 ml of chloroform and 0.25 ml of water. The tubes were vortexed vigorously to break up the cells, after which 0.3 ml each of chloroform and water was added. The tubes were again vortexed and centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 10 min, after which 0.7 ml of the upper phase was withdrawn and added to 2.3 ml of water in a conical tube. Approximately 175 mg of Dowex AG1 × 8 anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) was added to each tube and vortexed. The gel was allowed to settle and the supernatant poured off. The resin was then washed four times with 3 ml of water. IP1 was extracted by the addition of 0.5 ml of 200 mm ammonium formate/100 mm formic acid to each tube. After vortexing and allowing to settle, 0.4 ml of the supernatant was removed and placed into a 20-ml scintillation vial. This procedure was repeated, and 0.5 ml of supernatant was removed and combined with the other extract. Ten ml of scintillation fluid was added to each combined extract and counted. To account for differences in cell number between different wells, the counts obtained for each extract were divided by the total radioactivity present in the respective lipid fraction. In cardiac cells, each contraction is dependent on a transient elevation of [Ca2+]i. Thus, we recorded the frequency of fura-2-reported Ca2+ transients in spontaneously beating cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes as a measure of the contraction rate. Fig. 1 A shows the effect of 500 nm CCh in the perfusion solution on the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients. At this concentration, CCh immediately and completely abolished the spontaneous contractions as evidenced by the lack of Ca2+ transients. Washout of CCh resulted in the reappearance of Ca2+ transients, demonstrating the reversible nature of this inhibitory response. In most cases, the decrease in rate was accompanied by a decrease in the diastolic Ca2+ concentration. This negative chronotropic response to CCh was observed at all concentrations (>10 nm) tested; however, at higher CCh concentrations (>1 μm) there was often an attenuation of the response in the continued presence of agonist. In experiments in which the CCh-induced decrease in rate was measured, only the response in the first 2 min after the addition of drug was taken into account for analyses. During this time no appreciable desensitization or rebound of the response occurred. In a number of cardiac cell types, the stimulatory effects of mAChR stimulation are only seen after pretreatment with PTx. To determine whether CCh could also have stimulatory effects on the rate of spontaneous contractions in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml PTx for 18–24 h to inactivate the Gi/Go protein and thus abolish the CCh-induced negative chronotropic response. Under these conditions, exposure of cells to higher concentrations of CCh resulted in a concentration-dependent, reversible increase in the rate of spontaneous contractions (Fig. 1 B). The increase in rate was often accompanied by an increase in the diastolic Ca2+concentration. The concentration-response curves for the CCh-induced negative and positive chronotropic responses are shown in Fig. 1 C. A comparison of the curves for the two responses demonstrates that CCh is more efficacious in eliciting the inhibitory response (EC50 = 35 nm) as compared with the stimulatory response (EC50 = 26 μm). The maximal inhibitory response on the rate of spontaneous contractions was a complete abolition of the heartbeat (100% inhibition) and was achieved with concentrations of CCh ≥ 500 nm. For the positive chronotropic response, the threshold concentration for the observation of a response was 5 μm CCh and the maximum response was obtained with 300 μm CCh. At this concentration, CCh increased the rate of spontaneous contractions from a control value of 59 ± 6 beats/min (n = 12) to a value of 119 ± 8 beats/min (n = 12). After two minutes of wash, the rate of spontaneous contractions returned toward control rates with a value of 73 ± 7 beats/min, thus demonstrating the reversible nature of the positive chronotropic response. To determine whether the dual and opposite effects of CCh on the rate of spontaneous contractions are both mediated through cell surface mAChRs, the non-selective muscarinic antagonist, atropine, was used to inhibit the observed responses. In the presence of 100 nmatropine, the inhibitory effect of 500 nm CCh on the rate of spontaneous contractions was completely abolished (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, atropine inhibited the CCh-induced positive chronotropic response. In cells treated with 200 ng/ml PTx for 24 h, 50 μm CCh increased the rate of spontaneous contractions by 34 ± 3 beats/min (n = 5). In the presence of 100 nm atropine, however, 50 μm CCh produced a change in the rate of spontaneous contractions of −3 ± 3 beats/min, indicating a complete block of the positive chronotropic response (Fig. 2 B). Thus, both the CCh-induced negative and positive chronotropic effects are mediated through cell surface mAChRs. One hallmark of the dual effects of muscarinic activation on the heartbeat obtained from previous studies on various cardiac tissue preparations is that the two responses can be differentiated by different muscarinic agonists. It has been reported that while CCh and acetylcholine are able to elicit both the inhibitory and stimulatory effects, the m2 mAChR-selective agonist, oxotremorine, is able to elicit only the inhibitory response (4Pappano A.J. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1991; 2: 262-273Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26Korth M. Kuhlkamp V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether oxotremorine could similarly differentiate between the negative and positive chronotropic effects of mAChR activation in the cultured ventricular myocytes. In three separate experiments, addition of 1 μm oxotremorine to the superfusion buffer completely abolished spontaneous contractions in an atropine-sensitive manner (Fig. 3 A). In cells pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTx, however, oxotremorine was unable to mimic the"

Expression of the effector-domain mutant Ras-G12V,Y40C, which is unable to bind Raf, induced only modest down-modulation of tropomyosin.

These data suggest that this mutant form of MEK-1 interferes with a yet uncharacterized pathway controlled by Raf.

TM down-modulation observed in tumor cells is not an artifact of prolonged cell culture or deliberate transformation, since it has also been observed in freshly isolated human prostate, breast, ovarian, and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (8Alaiya A.A.

These data suggest that TM down-modulation is consistently associated with tumorigenesis regardless of the specific genetic alterations responsible for the transformed phenotype. Several lines of evidence suggest that TM down-modulation is essential for transformation.

Collectively, these results suggest that the expression of high molecular weight tropomyosin plays an important role in maintaining the non-transformed phenotype. Oncogenic Ras mutants activate many different downstream signaling pathways including those controlled by the activity of Rac, Rho, Cdc42, Ral, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and Raf (see Joneson and Bar-Sagi and Katz and McCormick, for reviews (19Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar)). To identify which pathway(s) downstream of Ras may be involved in TM down-modulation, we analyzed the effects of activated forms of Raf, Rac, Rho, Lbc, and Ral, as well as the Ras effector-domain mutant Ras-G12V,Y40C, on TM levels. We also investigated the effects of MEK and Raf inhibition in ras- and raf-transformed cells using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and a mutant form of MEK-1, MEK-S218A,S222A. The results of our studies implicate Raf in ras-induced TM down-modulation but suggest that the critical downstream effectors may be MEK-independent. Our data provide evidence for the existence of Raf substrates in addition to MEK-1 and MEK-2 which may control the levels of actin-binding proteins including the high molecular weight TMs and regulate the phenotype of transformed cells.

Fibroblasts grown to 50% confluency in a 6-well plate in medium without serum were stably transfected with the above expression vectors (0.5–2 μg of DNA) using 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression vectors were co-transfected with pSVneoin a molar ratio of 10:1, except for rho-Q63L in pZipneo and MEK-1-S218A,S222A in pAUCT, which contain the neo R gene, as indicated.

Transfections with MEK-1-S218A,S222A in pAUCTneo were performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline and cells were kept in tetracycline-containing medium unless otherwise indicated. Nearly confluent monolayers of fibroblast cultures in 6-well plates were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with 250 μl of lysis buffer (1% SDS in 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Samples were boiled to reduce the viscosity and protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Protein samples were mixed 4 to 1 (v/v) with 5 × loading buffer (6% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Equal amounts of protein per lane were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting. Equal loading of the samples was assessed by staining the blots with a 0.1% Ponceau S, 5% acetic acid solution (Sigma). The membranes were probed with antibodies directed against the relevant proteins and proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence as described previously (16Janssen R.A. Mier J.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was performed using the Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer GS-700 in combination with Molecular Analyst Software. The ERK in-gel kinase assay was performed as described previously (16Janssen R.A. Mier J.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vivo Raf and MEK activities were determined by assaying the levels of phosphorylation of their substrates MEK-1, and ERK-1 and ERK-2, respectively, using the anti-phospho-MEK and anti-phospho-ERK antibodies from New England Biolabs. ERK phosphorylation levels were normalized to the total ERK levels as determined by Western blotting using an anti-ERK-1 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We previously demonstrated that v-Ki-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells have substantially reduced levels of the high molecular weight isoforms of tropomyosin (TM-1, TM-2, and TM-3; Ref. 16Janssen R.A. Mier J.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 897-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ras is a molecular switch controlling many different signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis. In order to determine which signaling pathway(s) downstream of Ras might be involved in TM down-regulation, NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing the activated forms of Raf, Rac, Rho, Ral, or Lbc were generated and the levels of high molecular weight isoforms of tropomyosin were determined by Western blotting. Cell lines expressing the activated forms of Rac, Rho, Ral, or Lbc did not have reduced TM levels relative to non-transformed NIH3T3 cells (not shown). In contrast, cell lines transfected with constitutively active forms of Raf (v-raf and raf-20A) had markedly decreased TM-1 and TM-2 levels and a complete disappearance of TM-3, identical to the changes induced by v-Ki-ras (Fig. 1). These results indicate that Raf activity is sufficient to down-regulate TM expression. To determine if Raf activity is essential for ras-induced TM down-modulation, we tested the effects of the Ras effector-domain mutant, Ras-G12V,Y40C, which is unable to bind Raf, in non-transformed NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cell lines were stably transfected with vector only or with vectors containing H-ras-G12V,Y40C or H-ras-G12V. Expression of the transfected genes was validated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) and examination of cellular morphology. NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector alone were flat and grew as a monolayer. The H-ras-G12V-transfected cells showed a spindle-shaped morphology and grew in multiple layers. The H-ras-G12V,Y40C-transfected cells showed an intermediate phenotype (not shown). To confirm that the Ras-G12V,Y40C mutant was indeed unable to interact with Raf, we determined the levels of ERK-phosphorylation in these cell lines. To exclude the influence of growth factors, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Fig. 2 B shows that the levels of ERK-phosphorylation in theras-G12V,Y40C-transfected cells (normalized to total ERK protein levels) were comparable to those in normal NIH3T3 cells transfected with vector only. In contrast, the levels of ERK-1 and ERK-2 phosphorylation were increased 4.0- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in ras-G12V-transformed cells relative to normal NIH3T3 cells. Stable expression of H-ras-G12V induced a 98% decrease in the combined levels of TM-2 and TM-3 as determined by densitometry and a 90% reduction in those of TM-1 (Fig. 2 C). Conversely, stable expression of H-ras-G12V,Y40C induced only a 40% decline in the TM levels. This difference in TM down-regulation was not due to differences in transgene expression, since the levels of H-Ras-G12V,Y40C present in the transfectants used in this study were actually higher than those of H-Ras-G12V (Fig. 2 A). This result suggests that Raf activity is necessary for the complete down-regulation of tropomyosin induced by the ras oncogene, but that Raf-independent pathways may contribute to TM down-regulation. In addition to the Ras-G12V,Y40C study, we tested the effects of PD98059, a well characterized inhibitor of Raf-mediated MEK activation (31Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar), on TM levels in ras- and raf-transformed NIH3T3 cells. Ras-transformed cells were treated with various concentrations of PD98059 in Me2SO or with Me2SO alone for 5, 24, and 48 h and ERK-1 and ERK-2 activities were assayed using the in-gel kinase assay. ERK activities in ras-transformed cells were almost completely inhibited when the cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 for 24 or 48 h (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with PD98059 for 24 h at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 μmdecreased ERK-1 phosphorylation (normalized) by 83, 94, and 97%, respectively, and ERK-2 phosphorylation by 80, 90, and 98%, respectively. Treatment at the same concentrations of PD98059 for 48 h decreased the level of ERK-1 phosphorylation by 78, 65, and 55%, and that of ERK-2 by 87, 62, and 58%. The drug had only a modest effect on TM-2 levels and almost no effect on TM-1 levels (Fig. 3 B). In fact, the TM-1 levels actually decreased below baseline level when cells were incubated with PD98059 at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, PD98059 failed to restore TM-3 expression. The results shown in Fig. 3 have been corroborated in a subsequent study in which the duration of exposure to PD98059, and suppression of ERK activity, were extended to 78 h. In this study, TM levels remained depressed to the same extent as those observed at 48 h of exposure (not shown). Results similar to those reported above were obtained withraf-transformed cells. In these studies, both Raf-20A, a constitutively active form of Raf-1 with 313 amino acids deleted from the NH2 terminus and containing only the kinase domain, and v-Raf, which contains all effector domains of Raf-1, were used. Both forms of Raf preferentially phosphorylate ERK-2. Levels of phosphorylated ERK-2 in raf-transformed cells were comparable to those in v-Ki-ras-transformed cells, whereas levels of phosphorylated ERK-1 in raf-transformed cells were approximately 70% lower than those in ras-transformed cells (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of raf-20A-transformed cells with the MEK inhibitor at 50 μm for 48 h decreased the normalized levels of phosphorylated ERK-1 and ERK-2 by 97 and 90%, respectively. Treatment of v-raf-transformed cells with the inhibitor resulted in virtually undetectable ERK-1 phosphorylation and a more than 95% decrease of ERK-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A). As with theras-transformed cells, MEK inhibition in raf-transformed cells resulted only in a minor increase in TM-2 levels and no change in those of TM-1 or TM-3 (Fig. 4 B). Expression of the MEK-1 mutants MEK-1-S217A and MEK-1-S221A in ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells induces reversion to a non-transformed phenotype with flattening of the cells and restitution of actin cables (32Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that expression of mutants of MEK-1 in which the serine phosphorylation sites of Raf have been mutated may affect cytoskeletal organization, possibly by restoring the expression of various actin-binding proteins known to be down-modulated in transformed cells. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of the MEK-1 mutant MEK-1-S218A,S222A on tropomyosin expression in v-Ki-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. In this study, v-Ki-ras-transformed cells were stably transfected with tetracycline-regulable MEK-1-S218A,S222A. In the absence of tetracycline, the level of MEK-1-S218A,S222A increased 9-fold over background within 48 h (Fig. 5 A). At this point, the levels of phosphorylated ERK-1 and ERK-2 (normalized) were decreased by 60 and 63%, respectively, compared with those of cells grown in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 5 B), indicating that MEK-1-S218A,S222A was functionally active. Addition of tetracycline to cell cultures of untransfected v-Ki-ras-transformed cells had no effect on ERK phosphorylation levels (not shown). The degree of MEK inhibition induced by MEK-1-S218A,S222A (Fig. 5 B) was much less than that induced by PD98059 (Fig. 3 A). In addition, MEK-S218A,S222A expression did not inhibit MEK-1 phosphorylation in v-Ki-ras-transformed cells (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that MEK-S218A,S222A does not interfere with Raf activity in these cells. Despite the lack of Raf inhibition and the incomplete down-regulation of ERK phosphorylation, the levels of all three high molecular weight isoforms of TM in MEK-S218A,S222A expressing cells were up-regulated to levels comparable to those observed in non-transformed NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5 D). Addition of tetracycline to cell cultures of untransfected v-Ki-ras-transformed cells had no effect on TM levels (Fig. 5 D). The restorative effect of MEK-S218A,S222A on TM levels, its modest inhibitory effect on ERK phosphorylation, and the minimal effect of PD98059 on TM expression all support the contention that the ability of MEK-S218A,S222A to normalize TM levels in ras-transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts cannot be attributed to the disruption of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Rather, the data suggest that the MEK-S218A,S222A mutant affects the cytoskeleton by interfering with another, yet to be characterized, signaling cascade controlled by Raf. The aggressive behavior of ras-transformed cells is a result of its ability to activate multiple signaling pathways capable of cooperating in the promotion of anchorage-independent growth, motility, invasiveness, and metastasis. Of the various signaling molecules downstream of Ras, the serine/threonine kinase Raf is perhaps the most vital to the transforming activity of the GTPase. Constitutively active raf mutants are able to directly transform NIH3T3 cells (33Kolch W. Heidecker G. Lloyd P. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 426-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 34Troppmair J. Bruder J.T. Munoz H. Lloyd P.A. Kyriakis J. Banerjee P. Avruch J. Rapp U.R. J. Biol.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Active forms of Rac, Ral, and Rho on the other hand, are either non-transforming, weakly transforming, or functional only when introduced in combinations (26Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 35Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 36Urano T. Emkey T. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In the studies reported herein, we assessed the ability of active mutants of raf, rac, rho, ral, and lbc to down-modulate the high molecular weight TM isoforms and observed that raf was the only one capable of inducing TM down-modulation when introduced as a single oncogene. This parallel between the ability of an oncogene to down-regulate TM and to transform immortalized fibroblasts not only singles out Raf as the downstream Ras target most essential for this cytoskeletal modification but also reinforces the notion that TM down-modulation is a critical step in the acquisition of the malignant phenotype. The fact that Raf activity induces the down-modulation of TM does not necessarily indicate that it plays an essential role in ras-mediated cytoskeletal modifications. To determine if Raf activity was necessary for ras-induced TM down-modulation, we assessed the effects of the effector-domain mutant Ras-G12V,Y40C, which is unable to interact with Raf. The expression of this Ras mutant does indeed reduce TM levels, indicating that signaling pathways other than those activated through Raf may contribute to the cytoskeletal modifications observed in ras-transformants. However, this reduction is only modest and does not approach the nearly complete down-modulation induced by Ras-G12V or oncogenic Raf. These data suggest that Raf activation is essential for the nearly complete disappearance of the high molecular weight TMs observed in ras-transformed cells. So far, the only well characterized signaling pathway downstream of Raf is the MEK/ERK pathway. Since Raf activity appears to be essential for the ras-induced TM down-modulation, it was expected that inhibition of MEK in ras- and raf-transformed cells would lead to TM restoration. Surprisingly, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had only a modest effect on ras- orraf-induced down-regulation of TM levels. In the presence of PD98059, only the TM-2 isoform was partially up-regulated while TM-1 and TM-3 isoforms were virtually unaffected. These data indicate that MEK activity is not necessary for complete ras- orraf-induced down-regulation of TM. The inability of PD98059 to restore TM levels contrasts sharply with the effects of MEK-1-S218A,S222A, which increased the levels of all three high molecular weight TM isoforms almost to those observed in non-transformed NIH3T3 cells. The different effects of MEK-1-S218A,S222A and PD98059 on TM down-modulation are not due to differences in their respective potency. In fact, the MEK inhibitor suppresses ERK phosphorylation far better than does MEK-1-S218A,S222A. The mutant MEK-1-S218A,S222A used in our studies lacks the serine phosphorylation sites at positions 218 and 222, thereby preventing it from being activated by Raf. In a yeast two-hybrid screening, this mutant was found to bind tightly to all Raf isoforms (38Wu X. Noh S.J. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, of 29 clones isolated, Raf proteins were the only ones identified as interacting with this mutant MEK. The related triple mutant MEK-1-K97A,S218A,S222A, which has an additional defect in ATP binding, co-immunoprecipitates with Raf and ERK (39Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These MEK mutants and others have been shown to block chemotaxis toward fibronectin and to suppress the transformed phenotype of ras-transformed cells (30Anand-Apte B. Zetter B.R. Viswanathan A.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar). Because of these properties, these MEK mutants are regarded as dominant negative forms of MEK-1. However, despite this designation, few of these mutants have actually been shown to inhibit the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. In fact, numerous studies, including those in the present report, have shown that MEK-1 mutants in which one or more of the amino acids at positions Lys-97, Ser-218, and Ser-222 have been mutated to alanine are very poor inhibitors of MEK and/or ERK activation (32Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 39Syu L.J. Guan K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that MEK-1-S218A,S222A interferes with a yet uncharacterized pathway distinct from the MEK/ERK cascade leading to the down-regulation of tropomyosin. Although Raf isoforms were the only MEK partners identified in earlier two-hybrid experiments (38Wu X. Noh S.J. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), MEK has recently been shown to bind to the adaptor protein Grb10 and to the carboxyl-terminal region of kinase suppressor of Ras (41Nantel A.

Biol. 1998; 8: 46-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of MEK-1-S218A,S222A to normalize TM levels in ras-transformed cells may be due to an interaction between the mutant form of MEK-1 and one of these proteins or others yet to be identified. MEK is not the only downstream effector of Raf. In some cells, Raf activates the p70 S6 kinase (44Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and NF-κB (45Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Whether these factors play a role in ras-induced down-regulation of TM remains to be determined. The activation of NF-κB by rafis probably mediated by JNK (45Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Since the expression of a constitutively active Rac, which activates JNK, does not down-modulate TM (not shown), it seems unlikely that NF-κB activation would be responsible for the TM down-modulation observed in ras-transformed cells. We observed that rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase, had no effect on TM levels in ras-transformed cells (not shown). These negative data suggest that the non-MEK Raf target responsible for TM down-regulation may be novel. Our results on the regulation of TM are reminiscent of those reported by Ramocki et al. (29Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) on the regulation of MyoD in transfected fibroblasts. Although MyoD expression has recently been shown to be ERK-dependent in C2C12 myoblasts (46Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), Ramockiet al. (29Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell.

These results and ours emphasize the notion that not all Raf-induced phenomena are dependent on the activity of MEK. Ramocki et al. (29Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) also observed that the Ras-G12V,Y40C effector domain partially inhibited MyoD transcriptional activity, a finding comparable to our observation that the Ras-G12V,Y40C mutant has a modest down-modulating effect on TM levels. Collectively, our data and those of Ramocki et al. (29Ramocki M.B. Johnson S.E. White M.A. Ashendel C.L. Konieczny S.F. Taparowsky E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3547-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) indicate that Raf activation is the dominant means by which Ras reduces TM levels and suppresses MyoD transcriptional activity in transformed fibroblasts. Our results support the notion that MEK-independent signaling pathways exist downstream of Ras and Raf that regulate cellular transformation and differentiation. We thank M.

https://openalex.org/W1969264986,"Expression of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta) is spatially and temporally restricted during embryonal development. Also during retinoic acid (RA)-dependent embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell differentiation, RARbeta expression is initially up-regulated, while in later phases of differentiation expression is down-regulated, by an unknown mechanism. To gain insight into the regulation of RARbeta, we studied the activity of the RARbeta2 promoter and mutants thereof in various cell lines. While the RARbeta2 promoter is activated by RA in a limited number of cell lines, synthetic RA-responsive reporters are activated in most cell types. We show that the expression levels of proteins that bind to the beta-retinoic acid response element (RAR/retinoid X receptors and orphan receptors) and also the differential expression of a number of coactivators modulate the RA response on both natural and synthetic reporters. We further show that cell type-specific activation of the RARbeta2 promoter is dependent on the promoter architecture including the spacing between retinoic acid response element and TATA-box and initiator sequence (betaINR). Mutation within these regions caused a decrease in the activity of this promoter in responsive EC cells, while an increase in activity in non-EC cell lines was observed. Cell-specific complexes were formed on the betaINR, suggesting that the betaINR contributes to cell-specific activation of the promoter. On this basis we propose that promoter context-dependent and more general RA response-determining mechanisms contribute to cell-specific RA-dependent activation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1991117082,"Cytokines play crucial roles in the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. They bind to specific cell membrane receptors that usually do not possess intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Janus kinases (JAKs) are cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases that physically interact with intracellular domains of the cytokine receptors and have been implicated in playing important roles in signal transduction triggered by the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. However, it is still uncertain whether JAK activation alone suffices to induce cell proliferation. In this work, we modified Tyk2, a member of the JAK family, by adding a membrane localization sequence and a chemical dimerizer (coumermycin)-dependent dimerization sequence. The modified Tyk2 was activated in a coumermycin-dependent manner, and the activated Tyk2 conferred cytokine independence upon interleukin-3-dependent pro-B lymphoid cells. This cytokine-independent proliferation was completely inhibited by dominant-negative Ras. These results indicate that activation of JAK through membrane-proximal dimerization is sufficient to induce cell cycle progression and that Ras is essentially involved in JAK-triggered mitogenesis.

Janus kinases signal transducers and activators of transcription interleukin-3 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Growth and differentiation of hematopoietic cells are tightly controlled by a distinct class of humoral factors termed cytokines (1Paul W.E. Seder R.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 241-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1685) Google Scholar). The spatial and temporal expression of particular sets of cytokines ensures the propagation and differentiation of specialized lineages of hematopoietic cells. Cytokines interact with specific cell membrane receptors that, in general, do not possess intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity (2Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 3Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the cytokine receptors associate with cytoplasmic nonreceptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases, thereby forming molecular complexes that are functionally equivalent to the receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases. Of these kinases, Janus kinases (JAKs)1 have been implicated as playing crucial roles in cytokine signaling because they physically bind to the receptor cytoplasmic regions that appear to be critical in mitogenic signal transduction, and their kinase activity is rapidly stimulated by cytokine binding to these receptors (4Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Activated JAKs phosphorylate a series of substrates that include a class of transcription factors termed STATs. To date, seven different STATs have been described. Once phosphorylated, the STATs translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where they initiate transcription of cytokine-responsive genes (5Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 6Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Different cytokine receptors activate distinct sets of JAKs and STATs upon ligand stimulation, and this may explain, at least in part, the redundant and pleiotropic actions of cytokines. Cytokines are known to activate multiple cytoplasmic signal-transducing molecules in addition to JAKs. Src family proteins are another class of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases that are rapidly activated in response to a variety of cytokine signals (7Hatakeyama M. Kono T. Kobayashi N. Kawahara A.

Cytokine signals also activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (20Merida I. Diez E. Gaulton G.N. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2202-2207PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise roles of these cytoplasmic signal transducers in cytokine-mediated cell growth and differentiation are not well understood. Concomitant activation of multiple signaling pathways that lie downstream of the cytokine receptors makes it difficult to pursue specific roles of JAKs in cytokine-triggered mitogenesis. Receptor reconstitution studies have shown that mutant cytokine receptors that cannot interact with JAKs fail to transmit mitogenic signals (21Miura O. Cleveland J.L. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell.

Although the observations indicate important roles for JAKs in cell proliferation, they do not exclude the possibility that other signal transducers interact with the same regions that JAKs bind, or alternatively, such receptor mutations may disrupt structural integrity of the intracellular domains and inactivate receptor function. Recently, a chimeric molecule consisting of the extracellular epidermal growth factor receptor and the cytoplasmic Jak2 kinase domain was shown to confer epidermal growth factor dependence upon interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cells (26Nakamura N. Chin H. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19483-19488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a fusion protein consisting of the catalytic domain of Jak2 and TEL, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, transformed IL-3-dependent cells into factor independence (27Lacronique V. Boureux A. Valle V.D. Poirel H. Quang C.T. Mauchauffe M. Berthou C. Lessard M. Berger R. Ghysdael J. Bernard O.A. Science. 1997; 278: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the catalytic domain of JAK is capable of generating sufficient inputs to promote cell proliferation. In contrast, simple overexpression of wild-type Jak2 or a hyperactive form of Jak2 failed to convert cytokine-dependent cells to factor independence (28Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate that IL-3-dependent cells acquire cytokine independence by a conditional, membrane-proximal activation of Tyk2, a member of the JAK family, with the use of a recently developed chemical dimerization technique (29Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 30Farrar M.A. Alberola-lla J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The establishment of the conditional Tyk2-dependent cells made it possible to study downstream elements of JAK in mitogenesis in the absence of concomitant activation of other signaling pathways that lie downstream of the cytokine receptors. We provide evidence that Ras is critically involved in JAK-dependent mitogenesis. 6-1 cells were made from the Ba/F3-derived mouse pro-B cell line F7 (31Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T.

The 6-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20% WEHI-3B-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. The TcIP promoter is a chimeric promoter consisting of the tetracycline-regulated promoter (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar) and thelac operator. The promoter activity is negatively and positively regulated by tetracycline and IPTG, respectively (41Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Each of the JAK cDNAs was cloned into pOPTET-BSD, an expression plasmid containing the TcIP promoter and the blasticidin S resistance gene (BSD) as a selection marker. A kinase-dead Tyk2 was generated by substituting lysine at position 930 with isoleucine with the use of site-directed mutagenesis. G-Tyk2 was constructed by connecting a cDNA encoding human Tyk2 lacking the N-terminal 25 amino acids in frame to the 3′-end of the B subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase cDNA (30Farrar M.A. Alberola-lla J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To construct SG-Tyk2 cDNA, a synthetic oligonucleotide encoding the myristoylation signal sequence of v-Src (33Spencer D.M. Graef I. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9805-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was ligated in frame to the 5′-end of G-Tyk2 cDNA. G-Tyk2 and SG-Tyk2 cDNAs were each cloned into pOPTET-BSD. A cDNA encoding c-Ha-RasN17 was cloned into pOPTET-puro, which possesses the puromycin resistance gene instead of the BSD gene. Reporter plasmids were constructed from the pGL3-Basic vector by connecting the luciferase gene downstream of the c-fos,c-myc, and cyclin D3 promoter sequences, respectively. The 6-1 cells were transiently transfected with 1.25 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 2.5 μg of expression plasmid vector by the DEAE-dextran method. The same batch of transfected cells were split and cultured in cytokine-free medium for 30 h in the presence of either 1 μg/ml tetracycline or 5 mm IPTG before the luciferase assay. For conditional dimerization of the modified Tyk2, cells were treated with 300 nm coumermycin. Luciferase activities were measured by the luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression plasmid (2–10 μg) was linearized and transfected into 1 × 107 6-1 cells by electroporation. Transfected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 20% WEHI-3B-conditioned medium in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Drug-resistant cells were obtained by selecting transfected cells with 20 μg/ml blasticidin S or 1.5 μg/ml puromycin and were single cell-cloned by limiting dilution. For establishing cytokine-independent cells, blasticidin S-resistant cells obtained by transfecting pOPTET-BSD-SG-Tyk2 were collected, washed, and cultured in cytokine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of 5 mm IPTG and 300 nmcoumermycin. Proteins were induced in the stable transfectants with 5 mm IPTG and extracted with ELB buffer (34Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). For sequential immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting, cell lysates were first treated with anti-Tyk2 or anti-Stat5 antibody for 3 h. The immune complexes were then collected with protein A-Sepharose. Total cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products). Antibodies used were anti-Tyk2 (Santa Cruz sc-169), anti-Stat5 (Santa Cruz sc-835), anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology 05-321), anti-Raf-1 (Santa Cruz sc-133), and anti-Ha-Ras (Santa Cruz sc-520). To investigate the potential role of JAKs in cell proliferation, we first addressed the ability of each member of the JAK family (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2) to activate the expression of genes involved in G0/G1 cell cycle progression by transiently expressing each in the Ba/F3-derived subline 6-1 (31Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The cDNA was inducibly expressed in the IL-3-dependent 6-1 cells using a modified tetracycline-repressible promoter (TcIP promoter) (32Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar, 41Hoshikawa Y. Amimoto K. Mizuguchi R. Hatakeyama M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) whose activity was suppressed by tetracycline and induced by the lactose analog IPTG. Reporter plasmids were chosen to serve as indicators of proliferation-associated genes. They were constructed by connecting the luciferase gene downstream of the c-fos, c-myc,and cyclin D3 promoter sequences, respectively. These promoters were all activated upon IL-3 stimulation in 6-1 cells. Transient expression of each JAK except Jak3 in the 6-1 cells resulted in a significant activation of these promoters in the absence of IL-3 (Fig. 1 A). Among the JAKs examined, Tyk2 provoked the strongest activation of all three promoters. The promoter activation required an active kinase because a kinase-dead Tyk2 mutant completely lacked this activity (Fig. 1 B). It is unknown whether differences in promoter activation among different JAKs reflect levels of protein induced in the transiently transfected cells or specific roles of these JAKs in gene regulation. Notably, Tyk2 was expressed in the 6-1 cells and was activated in response to IL-3 as determined by its autophosphorylation status (Fig. 2).Figure 2Activation of endogenous Tyk2 by IL-3 in 6-1 cells. The 6-1 cells were growth-arrested by culturing in cytokine-free medium. After 8 h, cells were re-stimulated with IL-3 and harvested at the indicated times after stimulation. Whole cell lysates were prepared from the cells and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyk2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates (I.P.) were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (α-PY; upper). The same filter was re-probed with anti-Tyk2 antibody (lower).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) JAKs interact with the cytoplasmic domains of the cytokine receptors, and upon ligand-induced oligomerization of the receptor, the receptor-associated JAKs may become juxtaposed and transphosphorylate each other to be activated. Hence, we suspected that artificial membrane-proximal localization and dimerization of JAK could mimic a cytokine-activated form of JAKs. Accordingly, we used Tyk2 as a representative of the JAKs, modifying it so that it could be conditionally dimerized. To do so, we employed a recently developed chemical dimerization technique (29Spencer D.M. Wandless T.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1993; 262: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 30Farrar M.A. Alberola-lla J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal subdomain (219 amino acids) of the B subunit of bacterial DNA gyrase (GyrB) homodimerizes in the presence of a chemical dimerizer, coumermycin. Hence, we connected GyrB to the amino-terminal region of Tyk2 to generate a Tyk2 mutant (G-Tyk2) that homodimerizes in the presence of coumermycin. We also introduced the myristoylation sequence (14 amino acids) of v-Src into the amino terminus of G-Tyk2, expecting to target G-Tyk2 at the inner surface of plasma membrane as has been reported previously (33Spencer D.M. Graef I. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9805-9809Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The resultant construct was termed SG-Tyk2 (Fig. 3 A). The cDNA encoding G-Tyk2 or SG-Tyk2 was inserted downstream of the TcIP promoter and transiently introduced together with the c-fos promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid into 6-1 cells, and the effect of the modified Tyk2 on c-fos promoter was examined (Fig. 3 B). Induction of G-Tyk2 by IPTG led to a significant c-fos promoter activation that was further potentiated upon coumermycin treatment, indicating that dimerization of Tyk2 augmented c-fos gene activation. Expression of SG-Tyk2 resulted in stronger c-fos promoter activation than that induced by G-Tyk2 alone in the absence of coumermycin. Furthermore, dimerization of SG-Tyk2 by coumermycin resulted in a synergistic effect on the activation of the c-fos promoter. These results indicate that membrane tethering and dimerization of Tyk2 are two critical processes underlying the activation of the c-fospromoter by Tyk2. The above observations suggested that ectopic expression of the modified Tyk2 in the 6-1 cells could provoke certain biological effects in a coumermycin-dependent fashion. To address this possibility, we stably transfected the cDNA encoding SG-Tyk2 under the control of the TcIP promoter (pOPTET-BSD-SG-Tyk2) into 6-1 cells and selected blasticidin S-resistant cells. The cells were then pooled and cultured in cytokine-free medium in the presence of IPTG and coumermycin, which we expected to permit the constitutive expression of dimerized SG-Tyk2. After a few days of culture, a number of the drug-resistant cells started to proliferate despite the absence of IL-3. These cytokine-independent cells were then single cell-cloned by limiting dilution. All the independently established clones constitutively expressed high levels of SG-Tyk2 that could not be efficiently suppressed by tetracycline (Fig. 4 A, upper). This was most likely due to the growth advantage of the high SG-Tyk2 expressors selected under the cytokine-free culture conditions. However, the cytokine-independent proliferation was completely dependent on coumermycin because its withdrawal from the culture resulted in rapid cell growth arrest and cell death (Fig. 4 A, lower). This indicated that simple overexpression of SG-Tyk2 was not sufficient to transform 6-1 cells into factor independence. The proliferation rate of cells supported by IPTG and coumermycin was comparable to that supported by IL-3. To investigate whether the kinase activity of SG-Tyk2 in these stable transfectants was specifically regulated by coumermycin, we examined the autophosphorylation status of the SG-Tyk2 molecules. Treatment of the transfectant cells with coumermycin induced rapid and strong tyrosine phosphorylation of SG-Tyk2, indicating that the kinase was activated through the coumermycin-mediated homodimerization (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, the coumermycin treatment provoked strong tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Stat5 (Fig. 4 C). We concluded from these observations that the kinase activity of SG-Tyk2 was strictly under the control of the chemical dimerizer coumermycin. Notably, we could not detect tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs other than Stat5 by activated SG-Tyk2, although some are relatively abundantly expressed in 6-1 cells (data not shown). This indicates that Stat5 is a major if not the sole target of SG-Tyk2 among STATs in 6-1 cells. By employing the SG-Tyk2 transfectants, we next addressed cytoplasmic signaling molecules that lie downstream of Tyk2. In particular, we wished to determine whether JAK-triggered mitogenesis involves Ras, a critical transducer of mitogenic signals triggered by receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases. Indeed, treatment of the 6-1 cells with IL-3 activated Raf-1, a critical downstream effector of Ras, indicating involvement of the Ras pathway in IL-3-triggered mitogenesis (Fig. 5) (14Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Transient expression of dominant-negative c-Ha-Ras (RasN17) in the 6-1 cells strongly inhibited Tyk2-dependent induction of the c-fos, c-myc, and cyclin D3 genes as examined by a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 6 A). Accordingly, we generated doubly stable transfectants that coexpress SG-Tyk2 and RasN17 by transfecting pOPTET-puro-RasN17 into the SG-Tyk2 transfectant SG-15-2 (Fig. 6 B, left). Induction of superphysiological amounts of RasN17 in the doubly stable line SG/dnR-2-8 caused little inhibition of IL-3-dependent growth (Fig. 6 B, right). Hence, RasN17 overexpression itself was not toxic and was tolerated by the cells. The parental (SG-15-2) and transfectant (SG/dnR-2-8) cells were then treated with coumermycin and IPTG in cytokine-free medium to switch their growth from the IL-3-dependent state to the Tyk2-dependent state. As shown in Fig. 6 C (upper), both cell types expressed comparable levels of the SG-Tyk2 molecules that were activated and phosphorylated endogenous Stat5 upon coumermycin-mediated dimerization. However, in striking contrast to IL-3-dependent growth, the presence of RasN17completely inhibited Tyk2-dependent cell proliferation (Fig. 6 C, lower). Exactly the same results were obtained when another RasN17 transfectant (SG/dn-3-7) was examined. 2R. Mizuguchi, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observations. This observation indicates that Ras is essentially involved in Tyk2-mediated mitogenic signal transduction. JAKs are thought to play crucial roles in cytokine signaling. However, it remains to be elucidated whether they are directly involved in cytokine-dependent mitogenesis. In this work, we investigated the possible function of JAK in promoting cell proliferation. We first demonstrated that JAKs were capable of activating expression of proliferation-associated genes such as c-fos, c-myc, and cyclin D3 in a transient luciferase reporter assay in IL-3-dependent 6-1 cells. Because it induced the proliferation-associated genes most efficiently, we employed Tyk2 as a representative of the JAKs in this work. Notably, Tyk2 is expressed in the 6-1 cells as well as in the parental Ba/F3 cells and is rapidly activated in response to IL-3 (Fig. 2) (35Nagata Y. Todokoro K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Danial N.N. Rothman P.B. Goff S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1947-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that a hyperactive mutant of Jak2 that contains a point mutation in the JH2 domain failed to convert Ba/F3 cells to factor independence (28Luo H. Rose P. Barber D. Hanratty W.P. Lee S. Roberts T.M. D'Andrea A.D. Dearolf C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we did not succeed in transforming the Ba/F3 cells into factor independence by a simple ectopic overexpression of wild-type Tyk2.2 Accordingly, we modified the Tyk2 molecule so that it could mimic the receptor-associated JAK by adding a myristoylation sequence and a chemical dimerizer-dependent dimerization domain, respectively. Addition of the membrane-targeting sequence to Tyk2 significantly potentiated Tyk2-dependent c-fos promoter activation. Furthermore, dimerization of the membrane-targeted Tyk2 by a chemical dimerizer (coumermycin) resulted in a synergistic effect on promoter activation. Since this c-fos gene activation required active Tyk2 kinase, both membrane tethering and dimerization of Tyk2 appear to be critical in promoting maximal activation of Tyk2 and subsequent gene induction. Stable expression of the modified Tyk2 in the Ba/F3-derived 6-1 cells revealed that the kinase activity was strictly regulated by the coumermycin-mediated dimerization. The modified Tyk2 was rapidly autophosphorylated upon coumermycin treatment and phosphorylated endogenous Stat5. Furthermore, the modified Tyk2 was able to transform the IL-3-dependent cells into factor independence in a coumermycin-dependent manner. Our results thus demonstrate that JAK, when appropriately activated, suffices for cell proliferation and indicate the direct involvement of JAK in cytokine-dependent cell proliferation. In addition to the JAKs, the cytokine receptors are known to activate multiple effectors. The establishment of cells whose growth is strictly dependent on the activated Tyk2 provided us with a unique opportunity to study downstream elements of JAK in mitogenic signal transduction in the absence of concomitant activation of other signaling pathways that lie downstream of the cytokine receptors. Because it is a well known downstream transducer of mitogenic signals generated by receptor-type protein-tyrosine kinases, we were particularly interested in the potential involvement of Ras in Tyk2-dependent mitogenesis. Dominant-negative c-Ha-Ras (RasN17), which binds tightly to the Ras GDP/GTP exchange factor and prevents activation of the Ras effector pathways (37Feig L.A. Pan B.T. Roberts T.M. Cooper G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4607-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), inhibited induction of the proliferation-associated genes by Tyk2 and specifically blocked Tyk2-dependent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Our results thus indicate that Ras activity is essentially required for Tyk2-dependent mitogenesis and support the general importance of the protein-tyrosine kinase/Ras effector pathways in mitogenic signal transduction. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Ras by Tyk2 remain to be elucidated, the kinase may directly phosphorylate adaptor molecules such as Shc (12Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 82: 2296-2303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or alternatively, it may phosphorylate and activate other cytoplasmic signaling molecules that couple with the Ras signaling pathways. However, overexpression of constitutively active c-Ha-Ras did not succeed in converting the Ba/F3 cells to cytokine independence (38Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,39Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 3S. Noto, R. Mizuguchi, and M. Hatakeyama, unpublished observations. Accordingly, Ras activation is required, but is not sufficient for Tyk2-dependent mitogenesis. This indicates the participation of additional downstream targets of Tyk2 in Tyk2-dependent mitogenesis. Notably, tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 by Tyk2 was totally independent of the Ras status (Fig. 6 C). Hence, it is possible that concomitant activation of Ras and STATs is required for JAK-induced mitogenesis. Whereas dominant-negative RasN17 exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the Tyk2-dependent growth of 6-1 cells, IL-3-dependent growth was unchanged despite the continued presence of RasN17 in the same cells. Unresponsiveness of the IL-3-dependent cells to dominant-negative Ras has already been reported (38Terada K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27880-27886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The observation thus indicates the existence of an alternative, JAK-independent mitogenic pathway that redundantly triggers cell cycle progression in response to cytokine. This notion is further supported by a recent study with another cytokine receptor, the thrombopoietin receptor, demonstrating that JAK activation is not an essential prerequisite for thrombopoietin-induced mitogenesis in Ba/F3 cells (36Dorsch M. Fan P.D. Danial N.N. Rothman P.B. Goff S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1947-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that the JAK-dependent and -independent signaling pathways physiologically cooperate to proceed through the cell cycle in response to cytokine. Indeed, dominant-negative Ras, which is ineffective in the IL-3-dependent growth of Ba/F3 cells, was shown to inhibit the IL-3-dependent growth of 32D myeloid cells (40Okuda K. Ernst T.J. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24602-24607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the relative contribution of the JAK-dependent and -independent mitogenic signaling pathways in cytokine-stimulated cell proliferation may vary among different cell types as well as different cytokines. The presence of two (or more) distinct signaling pathways, each of which is capable of supporting cell cycle progression in a single cell, may well explain why no cytoplasmic signal transducer has yet been found to be indispensable for cytokine-triggered cell proliferation. Molecular elucidation of components constituting the JAK-dependent and -independent pathways in cytokine-dependent mitogenesis will be a major challenge, and the conditional Tyk2-dependent cells established here should provide a powerful tool to address this issue.

The net effect on HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake is not known.We determined the impact of acute in vivo inhibition of rat adrenal HL activity by antibodies on SR-BI expression and on human and rat HDL-[3H]cholesteryl ether (CEth) uptake in the adrenal gland. Rat HDL was isolated from rats in which HL activity had been inhibited for 1 h. The rats were studied under basal conditions (not ACTH-treated) and after previous treatment with ACTH for 6 days (ACTH-treated). Intravenous injection of anti-HL resulted in 70% lowering of adrenal HL activity in both conditions which were maintained for at least 8 h. In not ACTH-treated rats, inhibition of adrenal HL increased adrenal SR-BI mRNA (5.2-fold) and mass (1.6-fold) within 4 h.

The adrenal uptake of rat HDL-[3H]CEth increased by 68%, 4 h after the antibody injection. ACTH treatment increased total adrenal HL activity from 3.7 ± 0.5 milliunits to 34.0 ± 17.2 milliunits, as well as adrenal SR-BI mRNA from 2.9 ± 0.7 arbitrary units (A.U.) to 86.8 ± 41.1 A.U. and SR-BI mass from 7.7 ± 1.8 A.U. to 63.16 ± 46.7 A.U.

Jansen et al. (12Jansen H. Van Tol A. Hülsmann W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) showed that plasma HDL-cholesterol increased by in vivo inhibition of HL. At the same time de novo cholesterol synthesis in liver (13Jansen H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in superovulated rat ovaries (14Jansen H. Greef W.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 57: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) is induced. These findings are compatible with the involvement of HL in the uptake of extracellular cholesterol. HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake has been studied in a wide range of tissues under different metabolic conditions and may be taken up via several mechanisms. Besides the classical endocytotic pathway (see Ref. 15Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar as review) a selective uptake mechanism, in which HDL-cholesteryl esters are taken up without concomitant internalization of the protein part, has been proposed (8Van’t Hooft F.M. Van Gent T. Van Tol A. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 877-885Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar,16Glass C.G. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), exclusively present in liver and non-placental steroidogenic tissues, is involved in this process (18Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschultz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science (Wash. D. C.). 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 19Landschultz K.T. Acton S. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin.

O’Shaughnessy P.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 134: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Additionally, cellular cholesterol levels may modulate SR-BI expression (22Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Ng D.S. Francone O.L. Forte T.M. Zhang J. Haghpassand M. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15777-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Investigations in HL-deficient (knock-out) mice suggest a link between HL and SR-BI expression (22Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In female HL knock-out mice, SR-BI expression in adrenal gland was strongly enhanced. The induction of SR-BI was suggested to result from a lowering of intracellular cholesterol stores because of HL deficiency. An alternative mechanism may be that SR-BI expression is stimulated compensatory to changes in plasma lipoprotein metabolism because of the long-term HL deficiency. Remarkably, despite the greatly enhanced SR-BI levels (3.5-fold), adrenal cholesterol (ester) stores were largely depleted suggesting that the increase in SR-BI did not result in adequate cholesterol supply to support steroidogenesis. This may indicate that HL activity is required for the optimal activation of selective HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake. In the present investigation we studied the impact of acute in vivo inhibition of HL activity on adrenal SR-BI expression. In addition, we measured the consequences for HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake under these conditions. Male Wistar rats (200–300 g) were kept under controlled conditions of humidity, light, and temperature with free access to tap water and chow diet. The animals were fasted overnight before use. ACTH treatment consisted of daily subcutaneous administration of 0.2 mg of Synacthen (a synthetic ACTH analogue, Ciba) per kg body weight for 6 days. Control rats were injected daily with saline for the same period. The IgG fraction of goat anti-rat HL and non-immune goat serum was isolated by protein G affinity chromatography. The IgGs were dialyzed against 5 mm (NH4)HCO3 and lyophilized. The obtained pellets were resuspended in 0.15 m NaCl to a concentration of 30 mg of protein/ml. The antibody preparation was tested for its ability to inhibit HL activity of heparin-containing rat liver perfusate. To inhibit adrenal lipase activity, the rats were treated with an amount of antibodies that inhibited the enzyme activity equivalent to all heparin-releasable HL activity in rats of the same weight. Control animals were injected with the same amount of control IgG. Four, eight, or twenty-four hours after antibody injection, adrenals were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 10 IU/ml heparin and 1 mmbenzamidine. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C), the post-nuclear fraction was assayed for hepatic lipase activity as described elsewhere (24Jansen H. Birkenhäger J.C. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1981; 30: 428-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was determined as triacylglycerol hydrolase and expressed as milliunits (nmol of free fatty acids released per min). Total tissue RNA was isolated from adrenal glands as described (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63166) Google Scholar). Adrenal RNA (7.5 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Highbond-N+, Amersham). The SR-BI cDNA probe for in situ hybridization was prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR using 1 μg of adrenal RNA. The reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed as described previously (26Vieira-van Bruggen D. Verhoeven A.J.M. Heuveling M. Kalkman C. de Greef W.J. Jansen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 126: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), using the primers SR-BI(1)-(5′-CGG AAT TCA GGG GTG TTT GAA GGC-3′) and SR-BI(2)-(5′-CGG GAT CCT GAA TGG CCT CCT TAT CC-3′) according to the human cDNA sequence (27Calvo D. Vega M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18929-18935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This primer combination yields a PCR product of 550 base pairs, which is ∼98% homologous with that of the rat (data not shown). The RT-PCR product (550 base pairs) was extracted from agarose gel and resuspended in sterile water. A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (570 base pairs) was also prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR from rat heart RNA and used as reference. Both probes were labeled using 1 mCi of [32P]ATP. Membranes were hybridized following standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were analyzed using a GS363 Molecular Imager System from Bio-Rad. Values of the SR-BI mRNA were normalized for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase contents in the same samples. Crude membranes of adrenal glands were isolated as described elsewhere (29Kovanen P.T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11367-11373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μg of membrane protein were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal anti-rat SR-BI antibody followed by incubation for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs as secondary antibody. SR-BI protein bands were detected and scanned using a Hewlett Packard ScanJet 4C and quantified. Human HDL was isolated from blood of healthy volunteers at a density between 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml by sequential ultracentrifugation using standard techniques (31Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). HDL was passed over a Sepharose-heparin column to remove apoE-containing lipoproteins (32Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After dialysis against 0.15 m NaCl, containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, the lipoprotein was labeled in its lipid moiety with [1α,2α-3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously for LDL (33Groener J.E.M. Pelton R.W. Kostner G.M. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The labeled HDL was reisolated by gradient ultracentrifugation (33Groener J.E.M. Pelton R.W. Kostner G.M. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl. Before use the preparation was filtered through a 0.45-μm Millipore filter. Rat HDL was isolated from blood of control animals injected with polyclonal anti-HL antibody and sacrificed 1 h later. During this period HL activity in the liver is inhibited 90–98%. The HDL fraction was isolated and handled as described above for human HDL, except that the lipoprotein fraction was collected at density between 1.050 and 1.21 g/ml. The labeling of rat HDL occurred in the presence of human lipoprotein-deficient serum as a source of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (33Groener J.E.M. Pelton R.W. Kostner G.M. Clin. Chem. 1986; 32: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To study adrenal HDL[3H]CEth uptake in vivo, two different procedures were used. In the first procedure rats were intravenously injected with 0.1 ml of concentrated anti-HL or non-immune IgG preparation. Four hours later 0.2 ml of human HDL-[3H]cholesteryl ether solution, corresponding to 124 nmol of total cholesterol and 1 × 106 dpm, was injected intravenously. Animals were sacrificed 4 or 24 h after the injection of labeled HDL. In the second procedure, animals were intravenously injected with 0.1 ml of concentrated anti-HL or non-immune IgG preparation. Two hours later 0.2 ml of rat HDL[3H]CEth corresponding to 100 nmol of total cholesterol and 1 × 106 dpm was intravenously injected. Two hours after the injection of the labeled HDL, 0.1 ml of concentrated anti-HL or control IgGs were administrated again. Animals were sacrificed 4 h after the labeled lipoprotein injection. The adrenals were excised, cleaned from adherent fat tissue, and weighed. Tissue samples were dissolved in Soluene-350 (Packard Instrument) for 4 h at 55 °C and analyzed for radioactivity. The radioactivity in the adrenals was corrected for contamination of plasma radioactivity and used 9.9% (v/w) plasma per organ (34Caster W.O. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1956; 91: 122Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the experiments with rat HDL the radioactivity in the adrenals was also corrected for the increase in HDL-cholesteryl esters between 2 and 4 h after the antibody injection (12.3%) (12Jansen H. Van Tol A. Hülsmann W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). HL activity was lowered in vivo by administration of HL activity inhibiting antibodies. Four hours after anti-HL administration to control (not ACTH-treated) rats, the adrenal lipase activity was inhibited by 68% (Table I). The adrenal HL activity remained inhibited for at least 4 h. After 8 h the adrenal HL activity was still 40% lower than in controls (non-immune) (2.21 ± 0.36 versus 3.68 ± 0.46 milliunits/organ). After 24 h, the adrenal lipase activity had increased to 2- to 3-fold over the basal activity. Four hours after the injection of anti-HL antibody into control (not ACTH-treated) animals the adrenal SR-BI mRNA content was greatly increased (5.2-fold) (Table I). SR-BI mass increased during the same period by 66%. Twenty-four h after the injection of anti-HL, when HL activity had increased above the basal activity, SR-BI mRNA was about 18% below control values (n.s.). SR-BI mass, however, remained increased at the level already reached 4 h after inhibition of HL activity.Table IIn vivo effect of anti-HL antibody administration on adrenal HL activity and SR-BI expression in control ratsHL activitySR-BI mRNASR-BI mass(total milliunits/organ)(A.U./organ)(A.U./organ)Control IgG (4 h)3.68 ± 0.462.9 ± 0.77.7 ± 1.8Anti-HL (4 h)1.18 ± 0.481-ap < 0.0001.15.1 ± 4.21-ap < 0.0001.12.8 ± 0.41-ap < 0.0001.Anti-HL (24 h)8.38 ± 1.081-ap < 0.0001.2.4 ± 0.6NS13.7 ± 3.51-ap < 0.0001.Animals were injected with goat non-immune IgG (control IgG) or with a goat polyclonal anti-hepatic lipase antibody (anti-HL) and sacrificed after 4 h or 24 h. Adrenal glands were removed, homogenized, and assayed for HL activity.

SR-BI mRNA and mass were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are mean ± S.D. (n = 7) except for HL activity at 24 h (n = 3) and for SR-BI expression (n = 3).

In the following experiments we studied the consequences of the changes in HL activity and SR-BI expression for the adrenal uptake of HDL-cholesteryl ester. To this end, the rats were injected with HDL labeled with a non-degradable cholesteryl ester analogue, [3H]cholesteryl ether (HDL-[3H]CEth). The accumulation of radioactivity represents the uptake of HDL-[3H]cholesteryl ether (HDL-[3H]CEth) as an estimation of HDL-cholesteryl ester. In the first 4 h after administration of labeled human HDL, 72.0 ± 2.4% of the injected HDL-[3H]CEth was cleared from the plasma compartment in control rats, compared with 66.0 ± 2.7% in antibody-treated rats (n.s). Most of this label is removed by the liver (not shown). The adrenals took up 0.58 ± 0.11% of the total injected dose during this time period (Fig. 1). In rats treated with anti-HL, the adrenal uptake of HDL-[3H]CEth was 41% higher than in the controls. This effect on adrenal HDL-[3H]CEth uptake was also present when the rats were studied 24 h after HDL-[3H]CEth injection, although it tended to be smaller (Fig. 1). Additional experiments were carried out using HDL isolated from rats in which HL activity had been functionally inactivated by anti-HL antibody for 1 h. In the first 4 h after the administration of rat HDL-[3H]CEth about 50% (controls, 53.0 ± 5.2%; anti-HL-treated rats, 47.6 ± 3.0%, n.s.) of the label was cleared from the plasma compartment. During this period control adrenals took up 0.47 ± 0.12% of the injected dose per organ. In rats treated with anti-HL, the adrenal uptake was increased by 68% (Fig. 1) (0.47 ± 0.12,n = 4 versus 0.79 ± 0.18,n = 5, p < 0.02). From these experiments, we concluded that SR-BI rather than HL activity corresponds with the uptake of HDL-cholesteryl ester in the adrenal gland. On the other hand, SR-BI expression may be modulated by changes in HL activity. Next we studied whether HL activity may affect HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake when the adrenal gland is stimulated by ACTH treatment and HL activity is greatly enhanced. Rats were treated with ACTH for 6 days, leading to about a 2-fold increase in HL activity (107 ± 13versus 213 ± 50 milliunits/g wet weight). Because the adrenal weight increased during ACTH treatment (35 ± 5versus 174 ± 61 mg/2 adrenals), the total lipase activity in the adrenals increased even more (9.2-fold) (Fig. 2). Under these conditions SR-BI expression is also greatly enhanced (Fig. 2). Total SR-BI mRNA in stimulated adrenals was 30-fold higher than in the control (2.9 ± 0.7 versus 86.8 ± 41.1 A.U./2 adrenals). SR-BI mass was less increased (4.9 ± 0.6 versus 19.5 ± 14.8 A.U./mg of protein) (Fig. 2), but total SR-BI mass in the adrenals was 8.1-fold higher than in the controls (7.7 ± 1.8 versus63.2 ± 46.7 A.U./2 adrenals). Under these conditions, the stimulated adrenals took up 7.2% of the injected dose of (HDL-[3H]CEth) in 4 h, which is about 12 times more than in the unstimulated adrenals (Fig. 2). Inhibition of HL activity under these conditions had no effect on SR-BI expression either in total mRNA (86.8 ± 41.1 versus 67.1 ± 9.9 A.U./2 adrenals) or in total SR-BI mass (63.2 ± 46.7versus 60.9 ± 33.6 A.U./2 adrenals). In addition, inhibition of HL activity did not influence [3H]CEth uptake (7.24 ± 1.58 versus 6.67 ± 1.40% of injected dose/2 adrenals) in ACTH-treated rats for 4 h. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the (selective) uptake of HDL-cholesteryl ester in the adrenal gland. Both L-type lipase, the adrenal form of HL, and SR-BI may play a role in adrenal cholesterol homeostasis. In vitro, several studies on the effect of HL on HDL-cholesterol (ester) uptake in cultured cells have been reported, but no in vivo data are available. HL and SR-BI expression may be coordinately regulated. Gene-targeted inactivation of HL in mice was found to be associated with increased expression of SR-BI. Despite the increase in SR-BI expression, adrenal cholesteryl ester stores were partly depleted (22Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This suggested that the induction of SR-BI could not fully compensate for the loss of HL activity in cholesterol homeostasis. The effect of the increased SR-BI on HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake was not evaluated. In the present study, we determined the effect of an acute inhibition of adrenal HL activity on SR-BI expression and on HDL-cholesteryl ether uptake in vivo. Administration of anti-HL to rats leads to a rapid inactivation of HL activity in adrenals and liver. The adrenal HL turnover is relatively slow. Once adrenal lipase activity is inhibited it remains lowered during at least 8 h, while the HL activity in the liver is restored to control values in 4 h. Twenty-four hours after the injection of antibody the adrenal lipase activity is increased above the control values. Acute inhibition of HL in the adrenal gland led to a greatly increased expression of SR-BI within 4 h, which was accompanied by a significant increase in HDL-[3H]CEth uptake. Twenty-four hours after antibody administration, SR-BI expression had returned to control values. The actual rate of adrenal uptake of HDL-cholesteryl esters at this time point cannot be determined as the major part of HDL-[3H]CEth uptake is by the liver (35Groener J.E.M. Van Gent T. Van Tol A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1002: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and takes place within the first 4 h after injection. Between 4 and 24 h after HDL-[3H]CEth administration the increase in uptake of label in the adrenal gland was much smaller in the antibody-treated animals than in the controls. In this time period SR-BI mRNA decreased to control values in the antibody-treated animals. This may partly explain the lower rate of uptake of HDL-[3H]CEth in the adrenals. We also used rat HDL isolated from animals in which HL activity had been functionally inactivated for 1 h. Therefore, this HDL had hardly been processed by HL in vivo prior to intravenous injection and is enriched in phospholipids and cholesterol (12Jansen H. Van Tol A. Hülsmann W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Uptake of [3H]CEth from these “unprocessed” homologous rat HDL was similar to that from human HDL. Our data are compatible with a model in which adrenal HL activity is a determinant of SR-BI expression and SR-BI is the most important determinant of HDL-[3H]CEth uptake. The latter is further supported by findings in ACTH pretreated rats. ACTH pretreatment led to a considerable increase in SR-BI expression, adrenal HL activity, and HDL-[3H]CEth uptake. The increase in SR-BI mass was in line with the increased HDL-[3H]CEth uptake. In stimulated rats the inhibition of HL did not affect either SR-BI expression or HDL-[3H]CEth uptake. This clearly rules out adrenal HL activity as a major determinant of HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake under these conditions. The mechanism of the interaction between adrenal HL activity and SR-BI expression in the control rats can only be speculated about. HL is an enzyme with high phospholipase activity. Its preferred substrates are HDL-phospholipids. HL has been shown to be able to modulate HDL-unesterified cholesterol fluxes between HDL and cells and specifically to diminish the efflux of cholesterol from cells to HDL (36Bamberger M. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 869-876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Johnson W.J. Bamberger M.J. Latta R.A. Rapp P.E. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5766-5776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI expression is likely to be regulated by the cellular cholesterol content (22Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be that in vivo inhibition of HL leads to an increased efflux (or diminished influx) of non-esterified cholesterol in the adrenal gland which in turn gives rise to induction of SR-BI expression. Subsequently, SR-BI may stimulate HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake. In this model the primary role of HL would be in the modulation of fluxes of unesterified HDL-cholesterol and that of SR-BI in the mediation of HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake. Taken together, HL and SR-BI may be part of mechanisms ensuring an optimal cholesterol supply for steroid hormone synthesis under a variety of conditions. We thank Dr. A. R. Tall for kindly providing the anti-SR-BI antibody and Dr. A. J. M. Verhoeven for help with the SR-BI mRNA assays."

Thus, p62 tyrosine phosphorylation is a common signaling event following activation of receptor and cytosolic tyrosine kinases. Isolation of a cDNA for p62 was reported, but it became clear that this protein was Sam68 and is distinct from the RasGAP-associated p62 (11Wong G. Muller O. Clark R. Conroy L. Moran M.F. Polakis P.

Recently, the RasGAP-associated p62 was cloned from cells transformed by oncogenic Abl proteins and was termed p62dok(downstream of tyrosinekinases) (16Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D.

Cell. 1997; 88: 205-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of p62dok has partial sequence homology to a pleckstrin homology domain and part of a phosphotyrosine binding domain. The protein is relatively rich in serines and threonines and has a C-terminal domain that is proline-rich (16Carpino N. Wisniewski D. Strife A. Marshak D. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Clarkson B.

Activation of the Abl oncogene has been associated with a variety of human leukemias. A Bcr-Abl fusion protein of 210 kDa, in which the first exon of c-Abl has been replaced by Bcr sequences encoding 927 or 902 amino acids is present in 95% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (18Ben-Neriah Y. Daley G.Q. Mes-Masson A.-M. Witte O.N. Baltimore D. Science. 1986; 233: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 19Shtivelman E. Lifshitz B. Gale R.P. Canaani E. Nature. 1985; 315: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Another Bcr-Abl fusion protein, p185bcr-abl, contains only sequences from Bcr exon 1 (426 amino acids) fused to exons 2–11 of c-Abl and is seen in 5–10% of de novo acute lymphocytic leukemias (20Hermans A.

The tyrosine kinase activity of these proteins has been shown to be essential for the transforming activity of the Bcr-Abl protein (22Daley G.Q. Ben-Neriah Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 151-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 23Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Muller A.J. Witte O.N.

Although numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins have been identified in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, the necessity of these proteins for Bcr-Abl transforming function are unknown. p120RasGAP and associated proteins, p190 and p62 are tyrosine-phosphorylated in Bcr-Abl cell lines, and p62 was shown to be a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in progenitor cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients in early phases of the disease (25Wisniewski D. Strife A. Wojciechowicz D. Lambek C. Clarkson B. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 688-693PubMed Google Scholar, 26Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, tyrosine phosphorylation of p62 has been shown to correlate with the ability of Bcr-Abl to transform fibroblasts (24Oda T. Tamura S. Matsuguchi T. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 27Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell.

These findings prompted us to analyze whether p62dok is the tyrosine-phosphorylated 62-kDa protein that has been described in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, to determine whether this protein is the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that correlates with fibroblast transformation, and to investigate protein-protein interactions of p62dok in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. The p210bcr-abl SH2 domain deletion (p210ΔSH2) and kinase-defective mutants were previously described (24Oda T. Tamura S. Matsuguchi T. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar) and were subcloned into the retroviral vector pGD (gift of G. Daley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). A p185 cDNA was a gift of O. Witte (UCLA). The SH2 domain deletion in p185 was created by replacing the KpnI to AatII fragment of p185 with the equivalent fragment from p210ΔSH2. The GST-CrkL fusion proteins were generated as described previously (28Oda T. Heaney C. Hagopian J. Okuda K. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. J. Biol.

The 32Dcl3 cell line (30Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2391-2395Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar) was obtained from Joel Greenberger (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and 15% WEHI-3B conditioned media as a source of interleukin-3. Rat-1 fibroblasts were obtained from Charles Sawyers (UCLA). They were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. pGD or pGD containing a full-length Bcr-Abl, a tyrosine kinase-defective mutant of Bcr-Abl, and the Bcr-Abl SH2 domain deletion mutants was introduced into the 32Dcl3 cells by electroporation as described (24Oda T.

Individual clones were selected after growth in soft agar and analyzed for interleukin-3-independent growth. Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing p185bcr-abl and p185ΔSH2 were generated as described (32Lugo T.G. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single clones were analyzed for Bcr-Abl expression and used for further experiments. Analysis of interactions using the yeast two-hybrid system were performed as described (33Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). A full-length p185bcr-abl was expressed as a LexA fusion protein. Full-length p62dok (gift of B. Stillman and N. Carpino) was expressed in frame fused to the acidic activation domain VP16. Interaction was identified by selection on plates lacking histidine and analyzed for β-galactosidase production as described (33Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Controls included Lex A, VP-16, and LexA-lamin. Antibodies recognizing Abl proteins (24-11 and K-12), p62dok, p120RasGAP, and GST were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Specificity of the antibodies for Abl proteins has previously been described (26Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bhat A. Kolibaba K. Oda T. Ohno-Jones S. Heaney C. Druker B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16170-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The 2C4 monoclonal antibody that recognizes p62dok was used exclusively for immunoprecipitations (Babco). The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, was generated using KLH-phosphotyramine as the immunogen and was used as described (35Druker B.J. Mamon H.J. Roberts T.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 36Kanakura Y. Druker B. Cannistra S.A. Furukawa Y. Torimoto Y. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1990; 76: 706-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against CrkL was generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 204–225 of CrkL. This antiserum was used exclusively for immunoblotting experiments. For other experiments, CrkL antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The hemagglutinin (12CA5) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. 32D, 32Dp210, and 32Dp210ΔSH2 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Whole cell lysates were normalized for either total protein using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) or by immunoblotting for p62dok or Abl proteins. Lysates expressing equivalent amounts of protein or Bcr-Abl were used in subsequent experiments. In experiments where normalization was performed for Bcr-Abl, control cells without Bcr-Abl expression were compared based on c-Abl expression levels. For immunoprecipitation experiments, lysates were normalized by immunoblotting of p62dokimmunoprecipitates for p62dok or by immunoblotting of Abl immunoprecipitates for Abl. Normalized lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of CrkL, p62dok, p120RasGAP, or Abl antiserum followed by SDS-PAGE or were analyzed as whole cell lysates by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF (Immobilon-P, Millipore) membranes in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192.5 mm glycine, 20% MeOH for 4 h at 0.45 A. Residual binding sites were blocked by incubation in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat milk for 60 min at 25 °C. The blots were incubated for 4–16 h at room temperature with primary antibody. Antibody reactions were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) or alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Dephosphorylation of p62dok was performed on p62dok immunoprecipitates using calcineurin (Thomas Soderling, Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU)) or protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 (John Denu, OHSU) as described (37Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Green Publishing Associates, Inc./John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). Briefly, p62dok was immunoprecipitated from 32D, 32p210KD, 32Dp210, or 32Dp210ΔSH2 cell lysates and bound to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For treatment with calcineurin, the p62dok immune complex was incubated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mmMgCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Calcineurin (0.5 units) was added, and the reaction was maintained at 37 °C for a further 15 min. For treatment with protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1, the immunoprecipitated p62dok immune complex was incubated in 50 mm imidazolium, pH 7.5, for 10 min at 37 °C. One unit of protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 was added, and the reaction was maintained at 37 °C for 15 min. In all cases, the untreated controls were handled in a similar manner to the treated samples, except no phosphatase was added. The reactions were terminated by the addition of loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. GST fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli DH-5α, and protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to exponentially growing cells. The GST fusion proteins were isolated from sonicated bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Coomassie-stained gels of the GST fusion proteins were used to normalize for expression of the various GST fusion proteins. Between 2.5 and 5 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in bacterial lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, containing 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). The beads were washed four times in ice-cold PBS and incubated for 4 h with normalized cell lysates. The beads were washed three times with PBS and boiled in SDS-sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes for immunoblot analysis. GST, GST-Abl SH2, GST-Abl SH3, GST-CrkL, GST-CrkL SH2, and GST-CrkL SH3n fusion proteins were used for this assay. PVDF membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were washed twice in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either GST only or with GST-Abl or GST-CrkL fusion protein (2 μg/ml) in binding buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.20, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaF, 1% nonfat milk, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Bound GST protein was detected by incubation with anti-GST antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 in binding buffer excluding milk, dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Antibody reactions were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. The blots were washed for 1 h in PBS-T between each of the steps. Bcr-Abl-expressing cells contain numerous tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins as compared with control cells, and one of the most prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins is a protein with a relative molecular mass of 62 kDa. We have previously shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein is significantly decreased in a Bcr-Abl mutant with a deletion of the SH2 domain (24Oda T. Tamura S. Matsuguchi T. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62-kDa protein was seen in 32D cells, a murine myeloid cell line, and Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing the SH2 domain deletion mutant (Fig. 1, A and B). This mutant renders 32D myeloid cells growth factor-independent but is defective in fibroblast transformation as determined by the inability to form colonies in soft agar (24Oda T. Tamura S. Matsuguchi T. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 295-301PubMed Google Scholar, 38McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 39Ilaria R.L.J. Van Etten R.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 3897-3904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, p62 tyrosine phosphorylation correlates with fibroblast transformation by Bcr-Abl but not its ability to induce factor-independent growth. Immunoprecipitation of p120RasGAP followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting demonstrated a marked decrease in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the RasGAP-associated p62 in cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion of Bcr-Abl as compared with full-length Bcr-Abl. (Fig. 1 C). The RasGAP-associated p62 protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated in the ΔSH2-expressing cells as compared with control cells, but its phosphorylation is significantly less than in cells expressing full-length Bcr-Abl. To determine whether this 62-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was the recently cloned p62dok, an anti-p62dok immunoprecipitation followed by a phosphotyrosine blot was performed. As seen in Fig. 2 A, p62dokimmunoprecipitated from cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion of Bcr-Abl is tyrosine-phosphorylated as compared with control cells without Bcr-Abl. However, the p62dok immunoprecipitated from cells expressing full-length Bcr-Abl demonstrates markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation with a slower mobility suggestive of hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). Equal amounts of p62dok were immunoprecipitated from each cell line (Fig. 2 B). Of note, in Fig. 2 A, there is a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in p62dok immunoprecipitates that migrates below p62dok. This protein is not recognized by p62dok immunoblotting of p62dok immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that it is distinct from p62dok and is probably a p62dok-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. To determine whether the pattern of p62dok mobility as determined by SDS-PAGE was solely due to phosphorylation, p62dok was immunoprecipitated from both the 32Dp210 and 32Dp210ΔSH2 cell lines, treated with purified calcineurin, a serine/threonine phosphatase, or with purified protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1. Phosphatase-treated immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with p62dok antiserum. As shown in Fig. 3, calcineurin treatment of p62dok had no effect on the mobility of p62dok, whereas treatment of p62dok immunoprecipitates with protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1 eliminated the more slowly migrating forms of p62dok. These data suggest that the retarded mobility of p62dok seen in the 32Dp210 cells compared with the 32Dp210ΔSH2 cells was due to differences in tyrosine phosphorylation. We have previously demonstrated that Bcr-Abl and RasGAP co-immunoprecipitate (26Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether p62dok was present in this complex, p62dok immunoprecipitations followed by Abl immunoblots or Abl immunoprecipitations followed by p62dok immunoblots were performed. In both cases, an association between p62dok and Bcr-Abl is detected (Fig. 4). This association is also seen in cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion of Bcr-Abl; however, less Bcr-Abl is present in the complex in these cells. These experiments have been performed normalizing for levels of protein or amount of Bcr-Abl or p62dok immunoprecipitated and have demonstrated consistently less Bcr-Abl in association with p62dok in cells expressing the ΔSH2 mutant. The data presented above suggest a possible interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated p62dok and the SH2 domain of Abl. To assist in localizing the domains of Bcr-Abl that may interact with p62dok, full-length Bcr-Abl or the Abl kinase domain tagged with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (12CA5) epitope was expressed in SF9 cells. Infected cells were lysed, and Bcr-Abl or the Abl kinase were purified by binding to 12CA5-Sepharose. Binding of p62dok to the purified Bcr-Abl or Abl kinase domain was analyzed by incubating cellular lysates with these immobilized constructs followed by immunoblotting of bound protein for p62dok (Fig. 5). Full-length p210bcr-abl, but not the kinase domain of Abl, interacted with p62dok from both the 32Dp210 and the 32Dp210ΔSH2 cell lines (Fig. 5). No p62dok binding was seen using lysates from 32D cells or 32D cells expressing the kinase-inactive Bcr-Abl (data not shown). These data suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of p62dok was required for binding to Bcr-Abl and that a domain outside the kinase domain of Abl mediates the binding of p62dok to Bcr-Abl. To further narrow the domain of Bcr-Abl that may be interacting with p62dok, GST binding assays using the Abl SH2 or SH3 or the SH2/SH3 domains were performed. In these experiments, the SH2 domain of Abl interacted with p62dok from both the 32Dp210 and 32Dp210ΔSH2 cell lines (Fig. 6). In the experiments presented in Figs. 5 and 6, both the hyperphosphorylated p62dok from 32Dp210 cells and the hypophosphorylated p62dok from 32Dp210ΔSH2 cells bound to Bcr-Abl (Fig. 5) or to the Abl SH2 domain (Fig. 6).Figure 6Analysis of p62dok binding to Abl domains expressed as GST fusion proteins. Lysates of 32Dp210 (top panel) or 32Dp210ΔSH2 (bottom panel) were analyzed for p62dok binding to the indicated fusion proteins. Glutathione beads (Beads) and bacterially expressed GST (GST) were used as controls. WCL was used to determine the presence and migration of p62dok.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The above data are consistent with an interaction between the Abl SH2 domain and tyrosine-phosphorylated p62dok but cannot address the question of whether these interactions are direct or indirect. To address this question, a gel overlay assay was performed using GST-Abl SH2 and SH3 domains as probes. p62dok immunoprecipitates from Bcr-Abl-expressing cells were performed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and probed using the Abl SH2 or SH3 domains. Fig. 7 shows that p62dokimmunoprecipitated from 32Dp210 cells bound to the SH2 domain of Abl, but no direct interaction was observed in p62dokimmunoprecipitates from cells expressing either kinase-inactive Bcr-Abl or the SH2 domain deletion of Bcr-Abl. No direct interaction was observed between the SH3 domain of Abl and p62dok in this assay (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the isolated SH2 domain of Abl can bind directly to tyrosine-phosphorylated p62dok from 32Dp210 cells. To further analyze whether a direct interaction between p62dokand Bcr-Abl occurs in vivo, in the context of a full-length Bcr-Abl, a yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed. For these experiments, full-length p185bcr-abl was expressed as a LexA DNA binding domain fusion protein, and p62dok was expressed as a VP16 activation domain protein. These constructs were transformed into a yeast strain containing a histidine gene under the control of a LexA promoter. Interactions between the proteins of interest are scored by growth on plates lacking histidine. Kinase-active Bcr-Abl was expressed in yeast as demonstrated by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (data not shown) and its ability to interact with Grb-2 (Fig. 8), an interaction that requires tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl (40Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). p62dok expression was confirmed by a positive interaction with Grb-2 (data not shown). In this system, we could not detect a direct interaction between p62dok and Bcr-Abl (Fig. 8). The above data are consistent with the model of Bcr-Abl interaction with p62dok shown in Fig. 10. In this model, an initial indirect interaction between p62dok and Bcr-Abl occurs, regardless of the presence or absence of the SH2 domain of Abl. In the presence of the SH2 domain of Abl, p62dok becomes hyperphosphorylated and is then capable of binding directly to the SH2 domain of Abl. To test this model, p62dok interactions in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells were analyzed. p62dok has multiple consensus binding sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules including Abl, RasGAP, and Crk proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, p62dok and Bcr-Abl co-immunoprecipitate, and as expected, p62dok and p120RasGAP are present in an immune complex (Fig. 9 A).Figure 9Interactions of p62dok with p120RasGAP and CrkL. Lysates of the indicated cells were immunoprecipitated with p62dok (A) or CrkL antisera (B) and immunoblotted with RasGAP or p62dokantisera as indicated. C, lysates of 32Dp210 (top) or 32Dp210ΔSH2 (bottom) were analyzed for p62dok binding to the indicated GST-CrkL or GST-Crk II fusion proteins. K39 is a Lys to Arg mutant in the FLVRES SH2 phosphotyrosine binding domain of CrkL, and SH3 is the amino-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL. Glutathione beads (beads) and bacterially expressed GST (GST) were used as controls. WCL was used to determine the presence and migration of p62dok. D, p62dok immunoprecipitates from lysates of the indicated cells were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with bacterially expressed CrkL SH2 domain, and binding was detected with a GST antibody (A). No binding was detected using GST alone or using the CrkL SH3 domain (data not shown). The migration of p62dok and the antibody heavy chain (VH) is indicated to theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CrkL has been identified as a prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells; therefore, the association of p62dok with CrkL was also analyzed. As shown in Fig. 9 B, CrkL immunoprecipitates from Bcr-Abl-expressing cells contain p62dok as do cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion mutant. Various domains of CrkL expressed as GST fusion proteins were analyzed for their ability to bind to p62dok. As seen in Fig. 9 C, full-length CrkL was capable of interacting with p62dok from 32Dp210 cells, but this interaction was reduced in cells expressing p210ΔSH2. In a gel overlay assay, the CrkL SH2 domain was capable of binding directly to p62dokimmunoprecipitated from Bcr-Abl-expressing cells (Fig. 9 D, lane 2). However, no direct binding of CrkL was observed in p62dok immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion mutant (Fig. 9 D, lane 3). No binding was detected using the SH3 domain of CrkL (data not shown). In this paper, we have demonstrated that p62dok is hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells but minimally phosphorylated in cells expressing an SH2 domain deletion of Bcr-Abl. In addition, p62dok is present in an immune complex with Bcr-Abl and RasGAP, suggesting that p62dok is the RasGAP-associated p62 protein. Further, p62dok, when hyperphosphorylated, is capable of binding directly to the SH2 domain of Abl and CrkL. However, no direct binding of p62dok to Bcr-Abl is seen in the yeast two-hybrid system. Thus, our current model of p62dok and Bcr-Abl interaction is that indirect interactions mediate initial binding of p62dok to Bcr-Abl, regardless of the presence or absence of the SH2 domain of Abl. Hyperphosphorylation of p62dok requires the presence of the SH2 domain of Abl, and once hyperphosphorylated, p62dok can bind directly to the SH2 domain of Abl or to other Bcr-Abl-associated proteins (Fig. 10). The finding that the SH2 domain of Abl is required for hyperphosphorylation of a substrate is similar to data obtained with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (42Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The identity of the protein that mediates the initial binding of p62dok to Bcr-Abl is presently unknown. We have previously shown that CrkL binds directly to a proline-rich region in the C terminus of Abl (29Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that CrkL is not responsible for mediating the initial interaction of p62dok and Bcr-Abl, since direct binding between CrkL and p62dok can only be demonstrated when p62dok is hyperphosphorylated. Another candidate for mediating the interaction is p120RasGAP, since this protein has been demonstrated to be present in an immune complex with Bcr-Abl and p62dok. Further, this complex is present in cells expressing the SH2 domain mutant of Bcr-Abl. Since the mechanism of RasGAP and Bcr-Abl interaction is not known, additional experiments will be required to test this hypothesis. Preliminary data from the yeast two-hybrid system suggest that p62dok and Grb-2 interact directly. Since Grb-2 is known to bind to tyrosine 177 of Bcr-Abl, Grb-2 is another candidate for mediating the interaction between p62dok and Bcr-Abl. The data presented here support the conclusion that p62dok is the bona fide RasGAP-associated p62. Previous experiments have demonstrated that a RasGAP-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 62 kDa is present in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells. This is supported by our finding of p62dok tyrosine phosphorylation and association with RasGAP in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. It has also been noted that tyrosine phosphorylation of a 62-kDa RasGAP-associated protein correlates with fibroblast transformation by Bcr-Abl (26Druker B. Okuda K. Matulonis U. Salgia R. Roberts T. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau N.R. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A similar RasGAP-associated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is seen in cells transformed by other activated tyrosine kinases such as Src and Fps, and lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein has also been observed in SH2 domain mutants of these proteins (43DeClue J.E. Vass W.C. Johnson M.R. Stacey D.W. Lowy D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6799-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Koch C.A. Moran M. Sadowski I. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4131-4140Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that p62dok is minimally tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells expressing an SH2 domain deletion of Bcr-Abl as compared with wild type Bcr-Abl. The lack of increase in phosphorylation of p62dok is seen in both fibroblasts and myeloid cells expressing the SH2 domain deletion mutant. The phenotype of the Bcr-Abl SH2 domain mutant is that it is defective for fibroblast transformation but remains capable of inducing factor independent growth in myeloid cells. Thus, the hyperphosphorylation of p62dok correlates with fibroblast transformation but not induction of growth factor independence by Bcr-Abl. In chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, Bcr-Abl is postulated to have several possible functions. These include an increased proliferation of progenitor cells, protection from programmed cell death, and an adherence defect leading to increased numbers of circulating immature cells. Since the function of p62dok is currently unknown, it is not clear which of these possible functions are impacted by p62dok hyperphosphorylation. However, the correlation of p62dok hyperphosphorylation with the induction of anchorage-independent growth in fibroblasts suggests a possible role for p62dok in mediating the adherence defect of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. In the absence of a biochemical activity, placement of p62dok function in a specific pathway will require additional knowledge of p62dok interactions or generation of p62dok null mice. We thank T.

https://openalex.org/W1966219402,"There has been speculation as to the existence of the mouse equivalent of human type I keratin 16 (K16). The function of this keratin is particularly intriguing because, in normal epidermis, it is usually confined to hair follicles and only becomes expressed in the suprabasal intrafollicular regions when the epidermis is traumatized. Previous studies suggested that K16 is highly expressed in the skin of mice carrying a truncated K10 gene. We therefore used the skin of heterozygous and homozygous mice to create a cDNA library, and we report here the successful cloning and sequencing of mouse K16. Recent in vitro studies suggested that filaments formed by human K16 are shorter than those formed by other type I keratins. One hypothesis put forward was that a proline residue in the 1B subdomain of the helical domain was responsible. The data presented here demonstrate that this proline is not conserved between mouse and human, casting doubt on the proposed function of this proline residue in filament assembly. In vitro assembly studies showed that mouse K16 produced long filaments in vitro. Also, in contrast to previous observations, transfection studies of PtK2 cells showed that mouse K16 (without the proline) and also human K16 (with the proline) can incorporate into the endogenous K8/K18 network without detrimental effect. In addition, K16 from both species can form filaments de novo when transfected with human K5 into immortalized human lens epithelial cells, which do not express keratins. These results suggest that reduced assembly capabilities due to unusual sequence characteristics in helix 1B are not the key to the unique function of K16. Rather, these data implicate the tail domain of K16 as the more likely protein domain that determines the unique functions.

Keratins are a family of proteins that form the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in epithelial cells. They are divided into two groups, the type I acidic keratins and the type II basic keratins (1Eichner R. Bonitz P. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The first step in keratin intermediate filament (KIF)1 assembly is the formation of heterodimers between a type I and a type II keratin (2Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1199-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 3Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8766-8774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although any type I keratin can bind with any type II keratin, only certain pairs of keratins exist in vivo (4Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1826-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). These pairs are expressed in a tissue-type and developmentally regulated manner (5O’Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T.-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar). However, for some keratins, such as K17, a specific/unique partner has not been found. K16 and its partner, K6, are expressed in various stratified epithelia including those of the oral cavity, esophagus, genital tract, and epidermis (6Quinlan R.A. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Achstatter T. Moll R. Jorcano J.L. Magin T.M. Franke W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 455: 282-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In the epidermis, they are normally confined to the hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands, although they are also expressed in the suprabasal layer of palmoplantar epidermis (6Quinlan R.A. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Achstatter T. Moll R. Jorcano J.L. Magin T.M. Franke W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1985; 455: 282-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 7Stark H.-J. Breitkreuts D. Limat A. Bowden P. Fusening N.E. Differentiation. 1987; 35: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The expression of these two keratins is of particular interest since, together with K17, they are expressed in hyperproliferative situations such as benign and malignant tumors, keratinocytes in culture, hyperproliferative skin diseases such as psoriasis, and wound healing (8McGuire J. Osber M. Lightfoot L. Br. J. Dermatol. 1984; 27: 111-127Google Scholar, 9Moll R. Moll I. Franke W.W. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1984; 276: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 10Stoler A. Kopan R. Duvic M. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Weiss R. Eichner R. Sun T.-T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). K6, K16, and K17 are therefore sometimes referred to as the “hyperproliferation-associated” keratins. Often associated with the expression of these keratins is the down-regulation of the differentiation-specific keratins 1 and 10, which normally predominate in the suprabasal epidermis (12Mansbridge J.N. Knapp A.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1987; 89: 253-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies suggest that K16 has unique properties that could affect the structural organization of KIFs (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Specifically, K16 appears to form shorter filaments than K14 with the type II keratins K5 and K6a. If this property of making shorter filaments is important for the modulation of keratinocyte behavior via alterations in the cytoskeleton during wound healing and in hyperproliferating keratinocytes, then the K16 sequence would be expected to be highly conserved among mammalian species. Mutations in keratin genes, including K16, have now been identified as the underlying cause of several inherited epithelial disorders (14Corden L.D. McLean W.H.I. Exp. Dermatol. 1996; 5: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Mutations in human K16 (hK16) result in pachyonychia congenita type I, which is characterized by nail dystrophy, focal palmoplantar keratoderma, and oral keratoses reflecting the expression pattern of this keratin (15McLean W.H.I. Rugg E.L. Lunny D.P. Morley S.M. Lane E.B. Swensson O. Dopping-Hepenstal P.J.C. Griffiths W.A.D. Eady R.A.J. Higgins C. Navasaria H.A. Leigh I.M. Strachan T. Kunkeler L. Munro C.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Despite the apparently important functions of K16 in humans, there has been some speculation as to the existence of a K16 gene in mice (16Schweizer J. Darmon M.B. Molecular Biology of the Skin: The Keratinocyte. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 33-77Google Scholar). Using a mouse model for the inherited skin disease bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, our previous studies suggested that K16 is highly expressed in the acanthotic epidermis of these mice (17Porter R.M. Leitgeb S. Melton D.W. Swensson O. Eady R.A.J. Magin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although there is some evidence to suggest that the hyperproliferation-associated keratins are controlled, at least in part, post-transcriptionally (18Tyner A.L. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we observed a significant increase in the putative mRNA levels of K16 in K10 mutant mice. It therefore seemed logical to assume that a cDNA library generated from the skin of these mutant mice would facilitate the isolation of the gene for mouse K16 (mK16). Here we describe the cloning and sequencing of a complete cDNA for mK16 isolated from such a library made from the skin of K10 mutant mice. Using the mK16 cDNA, in vitroassembly studies and transfection studies were carried out to assess previous hypotheses relating specific K16 sequences to function. Skin was removed from three homozygous, two heterozygous, and one wild-type neonatal C57Bl6 mouse as described previously (17Porter R.M. Leitgeb S. Melton D.W. Swensson O. Eady R.A.J. Magin T.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). mRNA was extracted using a Quickprep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA synthesis and library construction were carried out using a Zap Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The library was screened with a probe prepared by polymerase chain reaction of hK16 cDNA using the forward primer CTGGCTTTGGTGGTGGTTT and the reverse primer AGGCAGCTCAGTTCTAGGAGC (40 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and synthesis at 72 °C for 1 min). Random-primed DNA labeling of the probe with digoxigenin was carried out using a DIG-high prime labeling and detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The probe was diluted to 10 ng/ml in standard buffer and 50% formamide and hybridized at 37 °C overnight. The filters were washed two times in 2× SSC (20× SSC = 3m sodium chloride, 300 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature (5 min) and two times in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C (15 min). Positive colonies were detected by a colorimetric method using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma, Poole, UK) as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. The positive clones were excised as pBK-CMV phagemids and sequenced with T3 or M13 primers using an automated sequencer (ABI 377). Mouse cDNA, excised by anEcoRI/XhoI digestion from a pBK-CMV phagemid and labeled as described above, was used as a probe to screen for longer length clones. To obtain the sequence of the 5′-end, the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocol was followed using a RACE kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The following primers were used for amplification: SP1, GGATCTTCACCTCCAGGTCTC; SP2, CCACCAAATCCACTACCAAGTCC; and SP3, CTGCTGAAGCTCCCACCATAG. Sequencing of the RACE product was achieved using the SP3 primer. Complete sequence analysis of mK16 cDNA was obtained using the forward primers F1 (GACCATTGAGGACCTGAAGAG), F2 (TGTATGCAGCTGTCCCAGATC), F3 (CCTCAGCATGGCCACCTGCAG), and F4 (CTGAGGAGCTGAACAAAGAGG) and the reverse primers R1 (ATCTGGGACAGCTGCATACAG), R2 (AGCCTGGCATTGTCAATCTGC), R3 (GGCAGTTGTGGGTGAGGAGGC), and SP1 (see above). We were also able to sequence the mK14 clone 5.1 using the mK16 primers R1 and F1 and the plasmid-specific primers T3 and M13(−20). A polyclonal antibody to mK16 (RPmK16) was obtained by immunizing rabbits with the C-terminal peptide GSTSFSQSQSQSSRD of mK16 linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Frozen sections were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) at −20 °C for 5 min and incubated with RPmK16 diluted 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs (Sigma). Slides were mounted in 10% Mowiol, 2.5% diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). Complete mK16 was created by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from RNA extracted from K10 heterozygous mouse skins using Taqpolymerase, forward primer F3, and reverse primer R3 and cloned into pGEM (Promega). Five clones were sequenced in both directions, and one clone with a single silent mutation was selected for subcloning of the mK16 cDNA into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Transfection was carried out on subconfluent PtK2 cells grown on 13-mm2 glass coverslips using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. cDNAs of hK14 and hK16 cloned into pcDNA3 were used as controls. A mutant hK16 in pCR3 was also transfected. This cDNA was obtained from a patient with pachyonychia congenita and contains an L130P mutation. At 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 1 min at −20 °C in methanol/acetone (1:1). RPmK16 was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (1:500), and LL025 (K16), LL001 (K14), LE65 (K18) were applied undiluted. All primary incubations were for 1 h. After washing coverslips in H2O, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs (heavy and light chains; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., Stratech, UK), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma), or goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma) were diluted 1:50 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 30 min. Coverslips were mounted in Citifluor (Agar, Stansted, UK) and sealed with nail varnish. After removing coverslips from the culture dishes, the remaining cells were scraped from the dish and solubilized in SDS sample buffer (100 μl). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (19Reichelt J. Bauer C. Porter R.M. Lane E.B. Herzog V. Magin T.M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2175-2186PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: LE65 and LL025 (1:5) and RPmK16 (1:5000) in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated to alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:1000 (Dako, Bucks, UK). Detection was with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. H36CEI cells are derived from human epithelial cells of the eye lens (20Reddan J.R. Prescott A.R. Andley U.P. Bagchi M. Gribbon C. Dziedzic D. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1654Google Scholar). Subconfluent cells grown on 13-mm2 glass coverslips were individually transfected in a well of a 24-well plate with 0.6 μg of mK16, hK16, hK5, or hK14 cDNA in pcDNA3. Double transfections were with 0.3 μg of hK5 cDNA and 0.3 μg of each type I keratin cDNA. Transfection was achieved by linking the plasmid DNA to inactivated adenovirus particles (5 × 108) using 10 mm polyethyleneimine as described previously (21Baker A. Saltik M. Killisch I. Mautner V. Lamm G. Christofori G. Cotten M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Staining was carried out as described for PtK2 cells. Polyclonal antibody BL-18 to K5 was diluted 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline. hK5, mK16, and hK16 cDNAs were generated with an NdeI restriction site introduced at the beginning by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using a 5′-primer with a 3-base pair extension of CAT. After sequencing to check that no errors had been incorporated, the cDNAs were cloned into pT7-7 (mK16) (22Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) or pET-23b (hK16 and hK5) (Novagen) vectors. These plasmids were individually transformed intoEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and grown toA 600 ∼ 0.5 before inducing protein expression with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) for 4 h. Inclusion body preparation was carried out as described previously (23Quinlan R.A. Moir R.D. Stewart M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 71-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Keratins were purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a Merck-Hitachi Biochromatography system with a 10 × 150-mm Fractogel-EMD DEAE-650S column (Merck) equilibrated in 8 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Fractions of 2 ml were eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–0.4 mNaCl over 40 min at 1 ml/min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Recombinant type I and II keratins were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. Assembly was achieved either by a rapid dialysis procedure against 2.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 4 °C for 16–20 h (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) or by a staged dialysis procedure essentially as described (25Quinlan R.A. Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Campbell D.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 909-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples in 8 m urea-containing buffer were dialyzed in 4 m urea-containing buffer and then in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 25 mm2-mercaptoethanol. An additional dialysis against Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was included for direct comparison with the rapid dialysis procedure. The assembly was completed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Assembly was monitored at all stages by electron microscopy. Proteins were diluted to 1:10 and negatively stained using 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Grids were examined in a Jeol 1200EX transmission electron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. The efficiency of filament formation was assessed by sedimentation assay (25Quinlan R.A. Carter J.M. Hutcheson A.M. Campbell D.G. Curr. Eye Res. 1992; 11: 909-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assembly mixture was layered on top of 0.85 m sucrose in the final assembly buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 ×g at 20 °C in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor using a TL100 bench-top ultracentrifuge. The final pellet was dissolved directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the remaining protein in the supernatant was precipitated (27Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) before also being resuspended in sample buffer. Both protein samples were dissolved in volumes directly proportional to the original sample volume for direct comparison by SDS-PAGE. We have generated a Zap Express mouse cDNA library from the skin of mice created as a model for the skin disease bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Using the hK16 probe, two mK16 clones (4.2 and 8.1) and one K14 clone (5.1) were isolated as pBK phagemids. None of the clones contained full-length keratin cDNAs, so the library was rescreened with mK16 cDNA from the longer of the two clones. Two additional clones containing K16 were obtained (7.31 and 2.11), the largest of which was 50 base pairs short of the 5′-end (clone 7.31). The shared sequence of all four clones was identical. We obtained the 5′-sequence including the start codon and 10 base pairs of untranslated sequence using RACE. The complete cDNA sequence obtained from sequence analysis of the clones and the RACE product is shown in Fig. 1. When scanned against the data base, the sequence is most highly related to hK16 (GenBankTMaccession number S79867). After the TAA stop codon, there is a 157-base pair untranslated region including a poly(A) addition signal (AATAAA) and an 18-residue poly(A) tail. The K14 clone 5.1 was identical in sequence to the mK14 clone pkSCC52 reported previously (GenBankTM accession number J02644) (28Knapp B. Rentrop M. Schweizer J. Winter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 938-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our sequence analysis extends the mK14 sequence by an additional 17 amino acids upstream of QNLNDRLATY. The additional amino acids are identical to mK16. The sequence codes for a protein of 469 amino acids with a calculated M r of 51,514. All keratins have structural similarities, including an α-helical rod domain interrupted by short non-helical linker regions and non-helical head and tail domains. The rod domain is bounded by the highly conserved helix initiation and helix termination motifs and consists of four segments (1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) of conserved length (29Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The sequence of mK16 is 85% homologous to that of hK16 (Fig. 2), with the central α-helical rod domain being most highly conserved (89% identical over 308 amino acids starting at KVTMQNLNDRLATY and finishing at TYRRLDGE). The helix initiation motif differs from that of hK16 in that it contains a threonine rather than a serine. Although mutations in this motif can cause very severe disorders, this particular change is apparently tolerated and is also observed in mK14 (28Knapp B. Rentrop M. Schweizer J. Winter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 938-945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The helix termination motif also differs from that of hK16 by one amino acid residue; in this case, an aspartic acid residue replaces a glutamic acid residue. This glutamic acid is highly conserved in epithelial keratins; however, an aspartate is seen at this position in type I hard α-keratins found in hair and in CP49/phakinin, an intermediate filament protein of the eye lens (29Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1988; 10: 79-98Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Hess J.F. Casselman J.T. FitzGerald P.G. Curr.

Agata J. Eguchi G. Quinlan R. Maisel H. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A significant difference in the α-helical region is the lack of the proline residue in the 1B domain that has been postulated to be responsible for the formation of rather shorter keratin filaments by hK16 (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The head domain of mK16 shares 71% homology with hK16, over the first 113 amino acids of mK16. This region of hK16 has sequence that is identical to that of hK14 and hK17 (see Troyanovsky et al. (44Troyanovsky S.M. Leube R.E. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 127-137PubMed Google Scholar) for an alignment). Of these shared residues, 88% are conserved in the mouse sequence. In the tail domain, 70% of mK16 amino acids are present in hK16. Of particular note, 13 of the last 19 residues of hK16 are conserved. This region bears no homology to hK14 or hK17 and is likely to make K16 unique. The C terminus of mK16 is longer than that of hK16 and contains two additional charged residues. Therefore, it is perhaps of no surprise that a polyclonal antibody (RPmK16) raised against the last 15 amino acid residues has proved to be specific for mK16 and does not recognize hK16. We have tested the antibody on human skin specimens including scalp, axilla, thigh, face, breast, lip, palate, and finger and observed no staining of hair follicles or suprabasal epidermis, as is readily seen with the monoclonal antibody to hK16 (LL025) (33Wilson C.L. Dean D. Lane E.B. Dawber R.P.R. Leigh I.M. Br. J. Dermatol. 1994; 131: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, which constitutively expresses K16, did not stain with RPmK16 (34Ryle C.M. Breitkreutz D. Stark H.-J. Leigh I.M. Steinert P.M. Roop D. Fusenig N.E. Differentiation. 1989; 40: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mouse epidermis, however, was recognized by this antibody. Hair follicles and whisker follicles were positive in normal mouse epidermis (data not shown). Also, positive staining of the suprabasal layer of the acanthotic epidermis of K10 mutant mice was observed (data not shown) and was similar to the results obtained with LL025 (35Porter R.M. Reichelt J. Lunny D.P. Magin T.M. Lane E.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 951-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that forced expression of hK16 in PtK2 cells causes the endogenous K8/K18 network to retract from the cytoplasmic periphery (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This reorganization was described as increasing with time, and at 72 h post-transfection, >50% of the transfected cells showed a juxtanuclear location of the keratin filaments (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We therefore chose this time point to examine the effect of transfected mK16 in PtK2 cells. In 95% of the transfected cells, mK16 was incorporated into the existing K8/K18 network, forming normal filaments at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 3 a). In the remainder of the cells, small regular circular structures were observed (Fig. 3 b), as described in other transfection experiments of PtK2 cells with normal and mutant human keratins (36Paramio J.M. Jorcano J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37McCormick M.B. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J.

No perinuclear keratin filaments were observed comparable to those described by Paladini et al. (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). At 24 h post-transfection, mK16 had already incorporated into the endogenous K8/K18 filament matrix as shown by double immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3, c and d). For comparison, we also transfected PtK2 cells with plasmids containing either hK16 (containing the proline in coil 1B) or hK14 cDNA. Similar well extended filaments were observed as well as some small spherical aggregates found in 5% of the transfected cells (Fig. 3 e). Retracted filaments (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Wawersik M. Paladini R.D. Noensie E. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32557-32565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were only observed in transfections with K16 cDNA carrying a point mutation (L130P) obtained from a patient with pachyonychia congenita (Fig. 3 f). Both the monoclonal antibody to hK16 (LL025) and the polyclonal antibody RPmK16 were used to stain transfected cells (33Wilson C.L. Dean D. Lane E.B. Dawber R.P.R. Leigh I.M. Br. J. Dermatol. 1994; 131: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas LL025 stained cells transfected with either mK16 or hK16, RPmK16 only stained cells transfected with mK16. Analysis of transfected cells by immunoblotting showed hK16 and mK16 to have similar relative mobilities on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and confirmed the species specificity of RPmK16 (Fig. 4). To determine if mK16 could form filaments in the absence of an established keratin network, we carried out cotransfections of mK16 with hK5 into a human lens epithelial cell line (H36CEI). This cell line has vimentin (but not keratin) intermediate filaments (20Reddan J.R. Prescott A.R. Andley U.P. Bagchi M. Gribbon C. Dziedzic D. Quinlan R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1654Google Scholar). At 24 h post-transfection, >50% of the transfected cells showed extensive networks of keratin filaments when stained with BL-18 (Fig. 5 a). The filaments formed were comparable to those obtained in double transfections of hK14 or hK16 with hK5 in a similar percentage of transfected cells (Fig. 5,b and c). The remainder of the transfected cells either had not formed filaments or contained very short filaments. Sometimes large clumps of keratins were seen in the cells. These irregular filaments were seen in K5/K14-transfected cells as well as in K5/K16-transfected cells. No filaments were formed in single transfections. The assembly properties of mK16 were of particular interest due to the report that hK16, under certain conditions, forms shorter filaments with hK5/hK6 than does hK14 (13Paladini R.D. Takahashi K.T. Bravo N.S. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Keratins from human and mouse were expressed in bacteria and purified by ion-exchange chromatography for in vitro assembly studies. Two different methods of assembly were performed; one used a rapid dialysis procedure, and the other employed a staged dialysis procedure to remove the urea from the protein solution. In both"

We previously reported the presence in mammalian brain of an unusual protein termed high mass methyl-accepting protein (HMAP)1 discovered on the basis of its ability to serve as an effective substrate for protein-l-isoaspartate O-methyltransferase (PIMT; EC 2.1.1.77) (1Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22965-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). PIMT selectively methylates proteins and peptides containing atypical l-isoaspartyl (isoAsp) residues that form when certain Asn-Xaa and Asp-Xaa sequences undergo a spontaneous intramolecular rearrangement resulting in an Asp-Xaa linkage that is made through the Asp side chain. The resulting peptide contains an extra methylene in the polypeptide backbone and a free internal α-carboxyl group. IsoAsp seems to form most rapidly when Xaa is Gly or Ser and when the susceptible sequence falls within a highly flexible domain of the protein (2Powell M.F. Pearlman R. Wang Y.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24586-24595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular proteins contain low levels of isoAsp, usually less than 0.05 mol/mol of protein. In contrast, we estimated that HMAP contains ≥1 mol of isoAsp/polypeptide chain (1Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22965-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence supports the current view that PIMT serves a repair function in cells. In vitro, purified PIMT has been shown to convert isoAsp-Xaa linkages to normal Asp-Xaa linkages (11Johnson B.A. Murray Jr., E.D. Clarke S. Glass D.B. Aswad D.W. J. Biol.

In rat PC12 cells, inhibition of PIMT activity results in a rapid and significant accumulation of isoAsp sites that is reversed when the inhibition is withdrawn (14Johnson B.A. Najbauer J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the PIMT gene in mice produces a phenotype characterized by elevated levels of isoAsp in all tissues examined and by premature death between the ages of 28 and 60 days that is preceded by epileptic seizures (15Kim E. Lowenson J.D. MacLaren D.C. Clarke S. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6132-6137Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 16Yamamoto A. Takagi H. Kitamura D. Tatsuoka H.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The emerging picture implicates isoAsp formation as a major source of spontaneous protein damage in vivo, and PIMT as an essential enzyme for preventing the accumulation of these atypical and deleterious structures. The unusual level of isoAsp found in HMAP, its high affinity for PIMT, and its unique location in the brain prompted us to undertake a more detailed examination of its physical properties, regional distribution in brain, and developmental profile. Because of its high mass and heterogeneity, we previously speculated that HMAP might be an aggregate of cytosolic, age-damaged proteins that had become metabolically isolated, thereby eluding repair by PIMT (1Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22965-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The properties of HMAP found in the present study lead, however, to a different conclusion. HMAP consists mainly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) that reside in the extracellular matrix and play a key role in neural development by modulating the adhesive properties of neurons and glia. These new findings have important implications regarding a possible role for isoAsp in the development of the central nervous system.

Fresh rat brains used in the animal comparison and regional distribution studies were obtained from two 8-week-old anesthetized Sprague-Dawley male rats (Charles River). All subsequent steps were done at 4 °C using chilled equipment. The brains were homogenized in four volumes of homogenization buffer (5 mm sodium PIPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (w/w) sucrose, 6.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 90 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μg/ml leupeptin) by six strokes in a glass Teflon homogenizer at 3/4 motor speed using a Contorque Power-Stir (Eberbach Corp.). The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were recovered and stored at −70 °C until used. For studies on the developmental profile of HMAP accumulation, one Wistar male rat (Charles River) was used for each time point. Extracts were prepared as described above. Bovine and human brain extracts were prepared from frozen cerebral cortex in the same manner as described above for rat brain. The human sample, stored at −70 °C, was from a 64-year-old female who died from myocardial infarction with no evidence of brain disease. In a pilot study of human brain samples assayed for PIMT activity and protein isoAsp content, this sample placed closest to the group average (n = 11) for both of these parameters. 2J. Orpiszewski and D. Aswad, unpublished results. The human brain sample was obtained from the Irvine Research Unit on Brain Aging and Alzheimer's Disease at the University of California, Irvine. Bovine brains, obtained from a local slaughterhouse, were transported to the laboratory on ice. After removing the meninges and the bulk of the white matter that lines the cerebral cortices, the brains were stored at −70 °C until used. All operations were done at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Frozen cerebral cortex (500 g) was thawed slowly and then homogenized in 2 liters of buffer A (20 mm BisTris-Cl, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using an Ultraturrax model STD Tissuemizer (Tekmar Co.). After centrifuging the homogenate for 1 h at 25,900 × g, the supernatant was recovered through four layers of cheesecloth and combined with 700 ml of wet, packed DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE-23; previously equilibrated with buffer A), stirred gently for 30 min, and then filtered through Whatman 54 filter paper. The filtered DE-23 was washed once by resuspending in 700 ml of fresh buffer A, stirring for 30 min, and refiltering. HMAP was eluted from the DE-23 by resuspending it in 600 ml of buffer A containing 1.0 m NaCl (high salt buffer A), stirring for 30 min and then filtering. The DE-23 was treated with an additional 450 ml of high salt buffer A and the filtrates were combined. HMAP was precipitated from the high salt DE-23 filtrate by stepwise treatment with ammonium sulfate. The fraction precipitating between 30 and 95% ammonium sulfate saturation was recovered by centrifugation at 25,900 × g for 20 min, dissolved in 100 ml of buffer B (20 mm BisTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and dialyzed against this same solution until the conductivity reached a value ≤ 10 mmho. The preparation was centrifuged at 25,900 × gfor 20 min, and the supernatant was recovered. One-half of the HMAP preparation was chromatographed on a 2.5 × 24 cm column of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE-52) equilibrated in buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl. After loading the HMAP preparation and washing the column in buffer B, a 1.0-liter linear gradient of 100 to 600 mm NaCl in buffer B was used. The flow rate was 3.1 ml/min, and 16-ml fractions were collected. The majority of HMAP eluted as a broad, nearly symmetrical peak in the conductivity range of 30–45 mmho. Fractions enriched in HMAP were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration over an Amicon ZM-500 membrane (500-kDa cut-off) at 10 p.s.i. The chromatography and ultrafiltration steps were then repeated with the second half of the dialyzed HMAP, and the concentrated solutions from both fractionations were combined. The post-ultrafiltration material was dialyzed against buffer C (5 mm BisTris-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8) and centrifuged at 20,400 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was chromatographed on a 1.5 × 20 cm column of high resolution hydroxylapatite (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) equilibrated with buffer C. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of increasing phosphate generated by mixing 75 ml of buffer C and 75 ml of 300 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, and 4.0-ml fractions were collected. HMAP eluted as a trailing peak early in the phosphate gradient. HMAP-rich fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration over an Amicon YM-10 membrane (10-kDa cut-off) at 25 p.s.i. The preparation was then dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 250 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Final purification was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a 300 × 7.8-mm Bio-Sil SEC-250 high performance liquid chromatography column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Samples containing approximately 1 mg of HMAP in a volume of 200 μl were injected per run until all of the HMAP was chromatographed. A flow rate of 0.75 ml/min was used. HMAP eluted near the void volume and was concentrated by ultrafiltration, first with the Amicon ZM-500 membrane and then with the YM-10 membrane. Brain extracts and protein samples destined for analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography were methylated by purified rat PIMT (1.2–3.0 μm) in 50-μl reactions incubated for 10 min at pH 6.2 as described previously (1Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22965-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In these reactions, [methyl-3H]AdoMet was 36–50 μm and 12,000–30,0000 dpm/pmol. Prior to SDS-PAGE, disulfide bonds were reduced as described below. To assess the methyl-accepting capacity of HMAP at various stages of purification, samples were methylated for 30 min at pH 6.8 in 50-μl reactions containing 2 μm PIMT and 100 μm[methyl-3H]AdoMet (1500 dpm/pmol). Methyl transfer was determined by the diffusion method (24Macfarlane D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1357-1362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Potter S.M. Henzel W.J. Aswad D.W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1648-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Three different SDS-PAGE systems were used in this study. The high resolution pH 8.8 Tris-glycine system of Laemmli and Favre (26Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) was used when preservation of base labile isoAsp methyl esters was unnecessary. Gels were stained with either Coomassie Blue R-250 (26Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) or Stains-all (27Green M.R. Pastewka J.V. Peacock A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For analysis of3H-methylated proteins, we used either the pH 2.4 phosphate system of Fairbanks and Avruch (28Fairbanks G. Avruch J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1972; 1: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or the NOVEX NuPAGE system (Novel Experimental Technology) with pH 6.4 BisTris resolving gels and the pH 7.3 MES running buffer. In control experiments, we determined that the recovery of 3H-methyl esters associated with HMAP was similar for these two gel systems. For both systems,3H-methylated protein samples were reduced at pH 6.2 for 10 min at 50 °C in the presence of 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol and 2% (w/v) SDS and then brought to the appropriate final sample compositions before loading the gels (29Najbauer J. Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5183-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond reduction at lower pH was found to be ineffective, whereas reduction at higher pHs promotes hydrolysis of the protein methyl esters. Fluorography was carried out as described previously (29Najbauer J. Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5183-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Incubations were done at 37 °C for 45 min in 100 mm Tris-Cl, 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 8.0, with a final concentration of 0.5 milliunit chondroitinase ABC/μg HMAP or rat brain CSPGs and the following protease inhibitors: 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.25 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For the initial antibody screening, SDS-PAGE 5% acrylamide gels were used (26Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus at a constant 120 V for 1 h, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane in a Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot cell filled with Towbin (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 9: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44922) Google Scholar) transfer buffer. Transfer was done at a constant 100 V for 1 h at room temperature with the cooling unit in place. After electroblotting, to visualize the protein bands and assist in cutting the lanes into strips, the nitrocellulose membrane was stained with 0.5% (w/v) Ponceau S dissolved in 1% acetic acid. The strips were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), washed, and probed with primary antibodies. After washing with TBST, the strips were incubated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobins conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Vector Labs). Detection of antibody binding was monitored colorimetrically by the reaction of alkaline phosphatase with nitroblue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 505Google Scholar) Immunoblots used for comparison with fluorograms of3H-methylated HMAP were carried out on proteins separated on NuPAGE 4–12% gradient gels run for 5 h at 4 °C at a constant 100 V. Electroblotting and immunodetection conditions were the same as described above. Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following precipitation by 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid unless otherwise noted. Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. After hydrolysis in 6 nHCl, the amino acid composition of HMAP was determined on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems amino acid analyzer at the Protein/Peptide Micro Analytical Laboratory at the Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology. Chondroitinase-treated HMAP was subjected to SDS-PAGE (pH 8.8) on 1.5-mm-thick gels (14 × 17 cm) of 5% acrylamide, loading two 7-mm-wide lanes with 40 μg of protein/lane. After electrophoresis, the gel was equilibrated in Towbin (30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 9: 4350-4354Crossref Scopus (44922) Google Scholar) transfer buffer and electroblotted onto two layers of Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad) at 150 V for 17 h in a 4 °C coldroom. After blotting, the proximal membrane was washed with three changes of deionized water and allowed to air dry. Protein bands were visualized by virture of their differential drying rate and were outlined with pin pricks. The band of interest was excised from both lanes, and 75% of the combined sample was subjected to sequencing directly from the membrane pieces. N-terminal protein sequencing was done by the Biotechnology Resource Facility of the University of California, Irvine, on a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 477A automated sequencer with on-line 120A phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid analyzer and a 610A data analyzer. Sequencing procedures using polybrene were provided by the manufacturer, and sequencing reagents were purchased from the manufacturer. Fig. 1 shows that soluble extracts from rat, bovine, and human brain contain similar levels of HMAP. Endogenous methylation (lanes 1, 5, and 9) carried out in the absence of added PIMT or alternative substrates results in the methylation of high mass material (HMAP) that barely enters the gel. Note that the acidic SDS-PAGE system used here does not employ a stacking gel. Lanes 2, 6, and 10 demonstrate that endogenous methylation of HMAP is mediated by PIMT because it is blocked by high levels of an isoAsp-containing nonapeptide substrate (isoAsp-δ-sleep-inducing peptide) but not by the normal Asp form of this peptide (lanes 3, 7, and 11). Maximal methylation of HMAP and of other lower mass substrates is seen when methylation is carried out with addition of purified PIMT (lanes 4, 8, and 12). Because of its size and ready availability, we chose bovine brain as the source for purification and characterization of HMAP. Purification of HMAP from bovine brain is summarized in Table I, and the details are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results of the anion exchange chromatography, which provided the greatest purification of any single step, are shown in Fig. 2. The majority of HMAP eluted as a broad peak between 0.27 and 0.36 mNaCl, suggesting that HMAP is highly acidic. As previously reported (1Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22965-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), HMAP eluted near the void volume during size exclusion chromatography on a Biosil SEC-250 column, indicating an apparent mass of ≥700 kDa.Table IPurification of HMAP from 500 g of bovine brain cortexStepVolumeProtein1-aProtein was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that the trichloroacetic acid precipitation step was omitted for samples from the last three stages of purification.

Open table in a new tab SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide was used to monitor the purification of HMAP (Fig. 3). When gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, the intensity of protein staining at the expected position of HMAP (at the top of the gel lanes) remained low, and very little protein staining was evident anywhere in the most highly purified material (lane 6). Because of the highly acidic nature of HMAP, we tested Stains-all (27Green M.R. Pastewka J.V. Peacock A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 33Homer K.A. Denbow L. Beighton D. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as an alternative. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3, Stains-all revealed a staining pattern quite different from that obtained with Coomassie Blue. Most notable was the presence of intense purple-blue staining coincident with the expected position of HMAP, which is especially evident at the tops of lanes 10–12. Initial attempts to quantitate the specific activity and methylation stoichiometry of HMAP during its purification were hampered by problems with accurate protein determination. Our lab typically uses a Lowry assay (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) preceded by precipitation of the protein sample with 5% trichloroacetic acid to remove potentially interfering substances such as reducing agents and chelators. When this method was used with the most purified fractions of HMAP, we obtained protein levels that seemed unusually low. To investigate this further, we compared the trichloroacetic acid-Lowry method with protein estimated spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 280 and 260 nm and with quantitative amino acid analysis. The latter indicated that purified HMAP has an amino acid composition similar to that of the “average” protein (data not shown), and the 280/260 ratio indicated that HMAP contains little or no nucleic acid. The protein content of purified HMAP estimated by amino acid analysis agreed well with the estimate obtained by absorbances at 280 and 260 nm, and both estimates were 4–7 times higher than that obtained by the trichloroacetic acid-Lowry method. Upon further study, we found that HMAP is highly soluble in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Elimination of the trichloroacetic acid precipitation step, afforded by the use of appropriate buffer blanks, resulted in a Lowry assay that agreed well with the other methods. The direct Lowry assay allowed us to calculate a final specific activity of 17.7 nmol of methyl acceptor sites/mg protein, a value 80 times that obtained with the 26,000 × g soluble supernatant fraction of brain. 3In our previous communication (1Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22965-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) we described a preliminary purification of HMAP from bovine brain and reported that it had a methyl-accepting capacity of 12.1 nmol/mg of protein, a value close to that reported here. That study used a trichloroacetic acid precipitation in conjunction with the determination of HMAP protein, so the reported stoichiometry and purification in the previous study was overestimated by a factor of 4–7 compared with the present work. Considering that HMAP constitutes ≥50% of all the methylation capacity seen in soluble brain extracts (Fig. 1), the isoAsp content of HMAP is calculated to be 150–200 times that of the average protein in brain cytoso"

https://openalex.org/W1992389247,"The yeast transcriptional activator Adr1p controls expression of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase gene (ADH2), genes involved in glycerol metabolism, and genes required for peroxisome biogenesis and function. Previous data suggested that promoter-specific activation domains might contribute to expression of the different types of ADR1-dependent genes. By using gene fusions encoding the Gal4p DNA binding domain and portions of Adr1p, we identified a single, strong acidic activation domain spanning amino acids 420–462 of Adr1p. Both acidic and hydrophobic amino acids within this activation domain were important for its function. The critical hydrophobic residues are in a motif previously identified in p53 and related acidic activators. A mini-Adr1 protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of Adr1p fused to this 42-residue activation domain carried out all of the known functions of wild-type ADR1. It conferred stringent glucose repression on the ADH2 locus and on UAS1-containing reporter genes. The putative inhibitory region of Adr1p encompassing the protein kinase A phosphorylation site at Ser-230 is thus not essential for glucose repression mediated byADR1. Mini-ADR1 allowed efficient derepression of gene expression. In addition it complemented anADR1-null allele for growth on glycerol and oleate media, indicating efficient activation of genes required for glycerol metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis. Thus, a single activation domain can activate all ADR1-dependent promoters. The yeast transcriptional activator Adr1p controls expression of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase gene (ADH2), genes involved in glycerol metabolism, and genes required for peroxisome biogenesis and function. Previous data suggested that promoter-specific activation domains might contribute to expression of the different types of ADR1-dependent genes. By using gene fusions encoding the Gal4p DNA binding domain and portions of Adr1p, we identified a single, strong acidic activation domain spanning amino acids 420–462 of Adr1p. Both acidic and hydrophobic amino acids within this activation domain were important for its function. The critical hydrophobic residues are in a motif previously identified in p53 and related acidic activators.

Activation domains of transcription factors transmit signals to the transcriptional machinery of a cell to ensure proper gene expression. When tethered to a DNA binding domain, either covalently or via protein-protein interaction, they ensure that signals are transmitted to appropriate genes to activate their transcription. Although the specificity of gene expression is determined primarily by the DNA binding domain of transcription factors, activation domains can contribute to this specificity (1Tanaka M. Lai J.-S.

As with many eukaryotic transcription factors, Adr1p contains multiple domains. The ADR1 DNA binding domain (ABD)1 is encompassed by amino acids ∼70–165 (16Thukral S.K. Tavianini M.A. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A nuclear targeting signal is found in the first 21 amino acids of the protein (24Blumberg H. Characterization of ADR1, a Transcription Factor in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Ph.D. thesis. University of Washington, Seattle1987Google Scholar). Four transcription activation domains (TADs) were identified by fusion of various parts of ADR1 to the DNA binding domain of LexA as follows: TADI, amino acids 1–220; TADII, amino acids 263–359; TADIII, amino acids 359–571; and TADIV amino acids 642–704 (20Cook W.J.

In vitrobinding studies, as well as in vivo co-immunoprecipitation, suggest that TFIID, TFIIB, and Gcn5p, a histone acetylase, are targets of these activation domains (25Chiang Y.-C. Komarnitsky P.

In addition, two inhibitory regions were identified, one of which contains the protein kinase A phosphorylation site at amino acid Ser-230. Mutation of this site enhances the activity of Adr1p on both repressing and derepressing media by an unknown mechanism (27Cherry J.R. Johnson T.R. Dollard C. Shuster J.R. Denis C.L. Cell. 1989; 56: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 28Denis C.L. Gallo C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4026-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 29Denis C.L.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Deletion studies of ADR1 suggested that its activation domains were promoter-specific (20Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chiang Y.-C. Komarnitsky P. Chase D. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 32359-32365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Deletion of the 3′- half of ADR1, including TADIV, prevented cells from growing on oleate, an inducer of peroxisome proliferation, whose utilization requires ADR1 (14Simon M.M. Pavlik P. Hartig A. Binder M. Ruis H. Cook W.J. Denis C.L. Schanz B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This ADR1 deletion mutant could still support growth on glycerol, but further deletion of TADIII prevented growth on glycerol and still allowed ADH2derepression (14Simon M.M. Pavlik P. Hartig A. Binder M. Ruis H. Cook W.J. Denis C.L. Schanz B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here we describe the results of our search for transcriptional activation domains in Adr1p by fusing different parts of ADR1 to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 (GBD). In contrast to the results obtained using LexA fusions, our analyses indicate the presence of a single major TAD corresponding to TADIII. When TADIII was deleted from ADR1, the rate of ADH2 derepression decreased more than 10-fold without altering the stability of Adr1p, indicating that it plays an important role in transcription activation by native Adr1p. We have identified the region of TADIII that is important for activation as amino acids 420–462. Within this region, the pattern of hydrophobic amino acids matches that in the transcription activation domains of p53 and related acidic activators. Mutagenesis showed that hydrophobic amino acids within the consensus sequence were particularly important for transcription activation, suggesting a conserved role for this motif in mammalian and yeast cells.We examined the function of a gene we call mini-ADR1, a fusion of TADIII to the DNA binding domain of Adr1p. Mini-ADR1 activated ADH2 expression and growth on glycerol or oleate as well as wild-type, full-length Adr1p. Importantly, mini-ADR1 conferred stringent glucose repression on the ADH2 gene and on UAS1-containing reporters. The same amino acids that were important for transcription activation by GBD-TADIII were important for the activity of mini-ADR1.DISCUSSIONGAL4(GBD)-ADR1 fusions identified a single, strong activation domain comprised of only 42 amino acids (residues 420–462) within Adr1p. A previous analysis usingLexA-ADR1 gene fusions identified four activation domains including one between residues 359 and 571. The latter region was designated TADIII (20Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on our unpublished results,3 a later report (25Chiang Y.-C. Komarnitsky P. Chase D. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 32359-32365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar) tested residues 420–462 and showed that they were sufficient to activate transcription when fused to LexA. TADIII can function at three naturalGAL4-dependent promoters, at artificialLexA- and GAL4-dependent promoters, and at ADR1-dependent promoters. Surprisingly, TADs I, II, and IV did not significantly activate transcription fromGAL4-dependent promoters.TADIII is sufficient when fused to the nuclear targeting and DNA binding domains of ADR1 to carry out all of the known functions of ADR1. The observation that mini-ADR1could fully complement an ADR1-null allele was unexpected since the encoded protein is only 24 kDa, much smaller than full-length Adr1p (150 kDa). Recently we have found that when TADIII is replaced by the activation domain from the herpesvirus VP16 gene the resultant ADR1-VP16 fusion behaved in an identical manner to mini-ADR1.2These results argue strongly that regulation mediated byADR1 is due to the DNA binding domain of the protein or its binding site, UAS1 (40Finley Jr., R.L. Chen S. Ma J. Byrne P. West Jr., R.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5663-5670Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Adr1p have failed to find a regulatory domain that mediates glucose repression. In particular, attempts to demonstrate a regulatory role for phosphorylation at the cAPK site at amino acid 230 have not met with success (20Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cherry J.R. Johnson T.R. Dollard C. Shuster J.R. Denis C.L. Cell. 1989; 56: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 29Denis C.L. Fontaine S.C. Chase D. Kemp B.E. Bemis L.T. Mol. Cell.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1450-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our studies with mini-ADR1 and withADR1-VP16 2 demonstrate that neither the Ser-230 region nor the other portion of Adr1p that functioned as an inhibitory domain in Lex-ADR1 gene fusion (20Cook W.J. Chase D. Audino D.C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 629-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are essential for glucose repression mediated by Adr1p.The observation that mini-ADR1 or an ADR1(ABD)-VP16 gene fusion can complement anADR1-null allele also demonstrates that allADR1-dependent promoters can be activated by a single, small activation domain. Thus, it seems unlikely that wild-type Adr1p employs promoter-specific activation domains.Also surprising was the high level of activity shown by TADIII even when expressed from the weak ADR1 promoter on a low copy plasmid. TADIII was as strong as the activation domain of VP16. This provided us with a sensitive assay to measure the effect of mutations within the activation domain on the activation of UAS1-containing reporters and on ADH2 itself.Mutational analysis of the activation domain allowed us to identify a potential target of TADIII. Several activation domains from multicellular eukaryotes possess a conserved motif, FXXΦΦ, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid (43Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This motif is also present in TADIII, as shown in Fig. 9. Related sequences, FXLLX and GXXLLX, are also present. Most importantly, the conserved hydrophobic amino acids have been shown by mutational analysis to be important for the function of the activation domain. The conservation of this motif and its importance in transcriptional activation domains from mammals and yeast suggest that its function may be conserved as well.Co-crystal structures of the activation domains of VP16 and p53 complexed with hTaf31 and Mdm2, respectively, have demonstrated a role for the motif FXXΦΦ in interaction of an induced α helix of the activation domain with its partner (43Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 44Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar). These results suggest that this motif in ADR1 might interact with a protein related to either Mdm2 or Taf31. The yeast homolog of TAF31 is TAF17, an essential yeast gene (45Moqtaderi Z. Yale J.D. Struhl K. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14654-14658Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating the possibility that TADIIIinteracts TAF17.TADs have numerous targets in the nucleus (5Ptashne M.

One potential target is a histone acetylase complex. In vitro expressed GST-GCN5 and/or TFIIB interact withADR1 TADs, and ADR1-dependent gene expression exhibited ADA2 and GCN5 dependence (25Chiang Y.-C. Komarnitsky P. Chase D. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 32359-32365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Adr1p also interacts with TFIID in vivo as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, and specific components of TFIID that contact TADI (TAFIIs 25 and 90), TADII (TATA-binding protein, TAFII130/145), and/or TADIV (TAFIIs 25, 60, 90, 130/145 and TATA-binding protein) were identified in the same study (26Komarnitsky P.B. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5861-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). No target for TADIII was found.The fact that ADR1 encoded-TADs interact with multiple components presumably allows a higher level of transcription activation than would be possible if it interacted with a single factor. Therefore, it is surprising that mini-ADR1, containing only a single activation domain, was as active as the entire protein. However, TADIII cannot be the only TAD active atADR1-dependent promoters since its deletion from the entire protein reduced (about 10-fold) but did not abolish expression from these promoters. We speculate that in the context of the entire protein some of the ADR1-encoded TADs may be unavailable initially for interaction with components of the transcription apparatus and that during assembly of an active initiation complex (49Huang J. Weintraub H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5478-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or during DNA binding (50Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), different TADs may become accessible to contribute to activation. By exposing TADs as artificial proteins, such as in mini-ADR1, they may exhibit higher activities than they possess in their natural environment. This may explain why mutations that severely impair the activity of mini-ADR1 are less deleterious in the context of the native protein.Mutational analysis of TADIII identified important acidic and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 9). Changing hydrophobic amino acids to Ala had a more detrimental effect on activation than individual acidic-to-Ala substitutions, as has been observed for other acidic activators (46Drysdale C.M. Jackson B.M. McVeigh R. Klebanow E.R. Bai Y. Kokubo T. Swanson M. Nakatani Y. Weil P.A. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 51Leuther K.K.

Mutation of a cluster of charged (four acidic and one basic) residues at the C terminus of TADIII inactivated it. Mutating other clusters of acidic residues also significantly reduced transcription activation. Based on biochemical studies, it has been proposed that negatively charged regions of an activation domain might provide electrostatic interactions between an activation domain and its target, allowing weak initial binding that is supplanted by an induced fit interaction between hydrophobic residues on the two partners (43Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). There appears to be a correlation between negative charge of TADIII and transcriptional activity, but further mutagenesis and analysis is needed to test this rigorously. No promoter-specific defects were noted for any of the mutants tested. They had similar defects when tested in the context of a GBD-TADIII fusion or in mini-ADR1 and at different GAL4- and ADR1-dependent promoters. Thus, it is likely that they are defective in steps common to all of the promoters tested.Why was only one ADR1-encoded TAD evident when assayed in the GAL4 gene fusions whereas four were found usingLexA-ADR1 fusions? Several explanations are possible. (a) TADI, TADII, and TADIV might be promoter-specific, activating Lex operator-containing reporters but not UASG-containing reporters(4). (b) LexA-Adr1p fusions might be more abundant than GBD-Adr1p fusions. As shown here, ABD itself is inactive when expressed at physiological levels. However, when expressed at very high levels, its activity can be detected in derepressed conditions (16Thukral S.K. Tavianini M.A. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2360-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or in strains with mutations in ADR7, ADR8, or ADR9 (57Karnitz L. Morrison M. Young E.T. Genetics. 1992; 132: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TADI seems to require very high levels in order to display its activity. (c) TADI, TADII, and TADIV might be cryptic activation domains whose activity is strongly dependent on the particular fragment of ADR1 that is fused to the DNA-binding fragment. This is true for GAL4-ADI (39Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar) and for ADR1 TADIV (25Chiang Y.-C. Komarnitsky P. Chase D. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 32359-32365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). (d) The GAL4-ADR1 fusions encompassing TADI, TADII, and TADIV might have been inactive because they were misfolded. This seems unlikely because deletion of TADIII reduced 10–20-fold the activity of a GBD-ADR1 gene fusion that would still encode TADs I, II, and IV and yet the mutant protein was as stable as the wild-type fusion protein.The interpretation we favor to explain these different results invokes the ability of activation domains to function with different efficiencies at different core promoters (4Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We suggest that the LexA promoter used in the other studies recruits a different constellation of RNA polymerase II-associated factors than the GAL4- and ADR1-specific promoters we used or that the relative importance of the various factors differs at different core promoters (4Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since Adr1p deleted for TADIII can still activate transcription, albeit weakly, contacts mediated by other TADs are sufficient for activated transcription.Why does ADR1 encode 1323 amino acids if its essential functions can be carried out by mini-ADR1, encoding only 210 amino acids? A similar conundrum is presented by Gal4p, another large transcription factor (881 amino acids) whose essential features are present in a mini-GAL4 comprised of the DNA binding and activation/Gal80p-association regions (39Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 58Ding W.V. Johnston A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2538-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Dissection of GCN4 also revealed redundant activation domains, only one of which was necessary and sufficient for nearly wild-type function (52Drysdale C.M. Duenas E. Jackson B.M. Reusser U. Braus G.H. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1220-1233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a natural setting the other parts of these transcription factors may be important. Evolution may have favored the formation of large transcription factors so that they could perform different or overlapping functions at different promoters. Our laboratory-based experiments may only survey a small fraction of these functions. Global surveys of Adr1p function should allow us to test this hypothesis using the different ADR1 alleles described here. Activation domains of transcription factors transmit signals to the transcriptional machinery of a cell to ensure proper gene expression. When tethered to a DNA binding domain, either covalently or via protein-protein interaction, they ensure that signals are transmitted to appropriate genes to activate their transcription. Although the specificity of gene expression is determined primarily by the DNA binding domain of transcription factors, activation domains can contribute to this specificity (1Tanaka M. Lai J.-S.

Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The proteins contacted by activation domains include various subunits of TFIID, including TATA-binding protein itself and TATA-binding protein-associated factors, and other general transcription factors such as TFIIB, TFIIH, and members of adaptor or mediator complexes. By contacting these proteins, they recruit RNA polymerase II to the promoter and facilitate initiation and elongation of transcription (5Ptashne M. Gann A.
