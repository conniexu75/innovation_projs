https://openalex.org/W2007725471,"In cell encapsulation, transplanted cells are protected from immune rejection by an artificial, semipermeable membrane, potentially allowing transplantation (allo- or xenotransplantation) without the need for immunosuppression. Yet, despite some promising results in animal studies, the field has not lived up to expectations, and clinical products based on encapsulated cell technology continue to elude the scientific community. This commentary discusses the reasons for this, summarizes recent progress in the field and outlines what is needed to bring this technology closer to clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2089783517,"Preadipocytes are present throughout adult life in adipose tissues and can proliferate and differentiate into mature adipocytes according to the energy balance. An increasing number of reports demonstrate that cells from adipose lineages (preadipocytes and adipocytes) and macrophages share numerous functional or antigenic properties. No large scale comparison reflecting the phenotype complexity has been performed between these different cell types until now. We used profiling analysis to define the common features shared by preadipocyte, adipocyte, and macrophage populations. Our analysis showed that the preadipocyte profile is surprisingly closer to the macrophage than to the adipocyte profile. From these data, we hypothesized that in a macrophage environment preadipocytes could effectively be converted into macrophages. We injected labeled stroma-vascular cells isolated from mouse white adipose tissue or 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line into the peritoneal cavity of nude mice and investigated changes in their phenotype. Preadipocytes rapidly and massively acquired high phagocytic activity and index. 60–70% of preadipocytes also expressed five macrophage-specific antigens: F4/80, Mac-1, CD80, CD86, and CD45. These values were similar to those observed for peritoneal macrophages.In vitro experiments showed that cell-to-cell contact between preadipocytes and peritoneal macrophages partially induced this preadipocyte phenotype conversion. Overall, these results suggest that preadipocyte and macrophage phenotypes are very similar and that preadipocytes have the potential to be very efficiently and rapidly converted into macrophages. This work emphasizes the great cellular plasticity of adipose precursors and reinforces the link between adipose tissue and innate immunity processes.

This work emphasizes the great cellular plasticity of adipose precursors and reinforces the link between adipose tissue and innate immunity processes. White adipose tissue is known to undergo considerable changes. It develops mainly after birth, and its mass increases greatly in obesity (1Hahn P. Novak M. J. Lipid Res. 1975; 16: 79-91Google Scholar). Conversely, it almost completely disappears during starvation or cachexia (2Tisdale M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1763-1773Google Scholar). Tissue growth is due to increase in size and/or number of mature adipocytes. These mature cells differentiate from progenitors,i.e. preadipocytes, which are present in stroma-vascular fraction (SVF) 1The abbreviations used are: SVF, stroma-vascular fraction; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NCS, newborn calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate 1The abbreviations used are: SVF, stroma-vascular fraction; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NCS, newborn calf serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate and can be recruited throughout adult life (3Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. Negrel R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Google Scholar). This phenomenon seems to be reversible, and several reports describe the dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes into a preadipocyte state (4Zhang B. Berger J. Hu E. Szalkowski D. White-Carrington S. Spiegelman B.M. Moller D.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1457-1466Google Scholar, 5Ron D. Brasier A.R. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 223-233Google Scholar, 6Negrel R. Grimaldi P. Forest C. Ailhaud G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 377-385Google Scholar). Analysis of the literature revealed that adipocyte and monocyte/macrophage lineages have many features in common (3Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. Negrel R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Google Scholar, 7Takemura R. Werb Z. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C1-C9Google Scholar, 8Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24255-24263Google Scholar). In particular, proteins or functions known to be specific to one lineage are characterized in the other. For instance, mature adipose cells express a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase similar to that present in specialized phagocytes (8Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1006-1013Google Scholar), and preadipocytes and adipocytes secrete numerous inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and are sensitive to lipopolysaccharide activation (14Lin Y. Lee H. Berg A.H. Lisanti M.P. Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24255-24263Google Scholar). Conversely, aP2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, long described as specific to adipocyte lineage, have been detected in macrophages (12Pelton P.D. Zhou L. Demarest K.T. Burris T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 456-458Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that preadipocytes of the 3T3-L1 cell line as well as preadipocytes in primary culture display phagocytic and microbicidal activities similar to those of specialized phagocytic cells, i.e. macrophages (15Cousin B. Munoz O. Andre M. Fontanilles A.M. Dani C. Cousin J.L. Laharrague P. Casteilla L. Penicaud L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 305-312Google Scholar). This activity is lower than that of macrophages but is stimulated in inflammatory situations (16Cousin B. Andre M. Casteilla L. Penicaud L. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 380-386Google Scholar). A putative link between adipose and macrophage lineages was strengthened by the detection on preadipocytes and adipocytes of MOMA-2 antigen, a marker of monocyte-macrophage lineage (15Cousin B. Munoz O. Andre M. Fontanilles A.M. Dani C. Cousin J.L. Laharrague P. Casteilla L. Penicaud L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 305-312Google Scholar). However, the most commonly used macrophage cell surface markers, F4/80 or Mac-1 (CD11b) (17Martinez-Pomares L. Platt N. McKnight A.J. da Silva R.P. Gordon S. Immunobiology. 1996; 195: 407-416Google Scholar), were not detected under standard conditions on preadipocytes or adipocytes. Despite all these common features, no systematic or large scale comparison between these two lineages has been performed to further analyze the similarities among preadipocyte, adipocyte, and macrophage phenotypes. This can be done by large scale gene expression data set analysis such as transcriptome profiling. This technique is the commonest and most powerful tool to identify genes of interest differentially expressed according to time scale and/or treatment (18Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Google Scholar,19Gerhold D.L. Liu F. Jiang G. Li Z. Xu J. Lu M. Sachs J.R. Bagchi A. Fridman A. Holder D.J. Doebber T.W. Berger J. Elbrecht A. Moller D.E. Zhang B.B. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2106-2118Google Scholar). However, it has rarely been used to characterize and compare different phenotypes (20Alon U. Barkai N. Notterman D.A. Gish K. Ybarra S. Mack D. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6745-6750Google Scholar, 21Jiang Y. Vaessen B. Lenvik T. Blackstad M. Reyes M. Verfaillie C.M. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 896-904Google Scholar). We used this technique to compare adipocyte and macrophage lineages and found close similarities between preadipocyte and macrophage phenotypes, suggesting that preadipocytes can convert to macrophages. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we chose the peritoneal cavity as an adequate environment to support macrophage phenotype after preadipocyte transplantation. We were able to demonstrate that preadipocytes can efficiently and rapidly convert into macrophages. All components for cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen. The fluorescent nuclear marker 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Chimie. Adenovirus CMV-GFP was a gift from Prof. P. Moullier, Laboratoire de Thérapie Génique, AFM, Nantes, France. Antibodies: anti-F4/80 was obtained from Serotec (Cergy Saint-Christophe, France), and all others were obtained from Clinisciences (Mont-Rouge, France). Immunochemical reagents were purchased from Dako (Trappes, France). Collagenase (Roche Diagnostics) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France). Ob17 and Hgfu cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Dani, Nice, France. J774.2 and RAW 264.7 cell lines were purchased from ECACC. 5–6-week-old Swiss nu/nu and C57B6J mice (Harlan, France) were housed in microisolator cages in conventional animal quarters. All animals had free access to food and water and were sacrificed with CO2. Peritoneal cells were obtained by washing the peritoneal cavity of mice with 5 ml of sterile PBS and grown in DMEM/F12 containing 10% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (NCS). SVF and mature adipocytes were obtained from inguinal fat depot as previously described (22Bjorntorp P. Karlsson M. Pertoft H. Pettersson P. Sjostrom L. Smith U. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 316-324Google Scholar). Briefly, adipose tissue was digested with 2 mg/ml collagenase in 2% albumin-containing DMEM/F12 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. After filtration through a 25-μm nylon membrane to eliminate undigested fragments, cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to separate mature adipocytes from pellets of SVF cells. SVF cells were counted (Coulter Z2) and plated (30,000 cells/cm2) in DMEM/F12 10% NCS medium. Six hours after plating, cells were washed to remove all non-adherent cells. All cell lines were maintained before confluence in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and glutamine (2 mm). 3T3-F442A adipose differentiation was performed by adding rosiglitazone (100 nm) at the first confluence day, and then cells were fed every 2 days with the same medium. 3T3-F442A-differentiated cells were stopped 7 days after the beginning of differentiation. Culture medium containing 1 μg/ml DAPI or 70 plaque-forming units/cell adenovirus containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA under the control of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was added for 12 h on SVF cells (6 h after plating) or on non-confluent 3T3-L1 cells. Adequate adenovirus titer was determined after dose response infection study. This concentration was chosen to achieve significant labeling with limited toxic effects. The cells were then rinsed five times with DMEM + 10% fetal calf serum or DMEM/F12 + 10% NCS and twice with PBS. After trypsinization, preadipocytes were collected and washed twice with PBS. Before injection in the peritoneal cavity, cells were resuspended in PBS (2 × 106 in 500 μl). For control experiments, the supernatant of the last wash was collected and filtered at 0.2 μm before injection (500 μl). Co-cultures were performed in DMEM/F12 + 10% NCS for 24 h. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were labeled and washed as for in vivo experiments. Labeled preadipocytes and non-labeled peritoneal macrophages were plated (12,500 3T3-L1/cm2 and 25,000 macrophages/cm2) together onto glass slides (Lab-tek slides, Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) or in two chambers separated by a track-etched membrane (pore size, 0.4 μm). Yeast (Candida parapsilosis) was washed in PBS and suspended at 4 × 107 yeast/ml in DMEM/F12 + 4% NCS without antibiotics (23Takao S. Smith E.H. Wang D. Chan C.K. Bulkley G.B. Klein A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1278-C1284Google Scholar). After culture for 24 h on Lab-tek slides, peritoneal cells were incubated 45 min in 1 ml of yeast suspension at 37 °C in a CO2 chamber. Slides were then washed three times with PBS and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium. Mounted Lab-tek slides were observed with phased and UV lights (UV filter: λe, 340–380 nm; λa, 425 nm) or FITC (FITC filter: λe, 450–490 nm; λa, 515 nm). Phagocytic activity is the percentage of phagocytizing cells, and the phagocytic index is the average number of engulfed yeast per phagocytizing cell. For immunocytochemistry experiments, 3T3-L1 or peritoneal cells were cytospun onto glass slides and fixed in PBS with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Standard methodology was used to detect immunological staining (15Cousin B. Munoz O. Andre M. Fontanilles A.M. Dani C. Cousin J.L. Laharrague P. Casteilla L. Penicaud L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 305-312Google Scholar). PBS containing 0.01% polyoxyethylenesorbitant-monolaurate (Tween 20) or 1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin was used in DAPI-labeled or GFP-expressing cell experiments respectively. Primary antibodies (IgG2, rat anti-mouse) concentrations were 100 μg/ml for anti-Mac-1, 50 μg/ml for anti-F4/80, and anti-CD86, 500 μg/ml for anti-CD80, and 25 g/ml for anti-MHCII. A non-relevant IgG2isotype antibody was used as negative control. The secondary antibody was a rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin (Fab′ fragment) coupled with rhodamin-phycoerythrin (RPE) (concentration 5 μg/ml). RPE was visualized with fluorescent light (TX2 filter: λe, 560/40 nm; λa, 645/75 nm). RNA was isolated from cell culture, isolated cells, or cold powdered tissue samples using Tripur reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was treated for 30 min at 37 °C with DNase to eliminate potential DNA residues. RNA was then purified using the phenol/chloroform extraction procedure (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA quality was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric analysis (OD260/280). Ten micrograms of total RNA (denatured at 70 °C for 10 min) were reverse-transcribed for 2 h at 42 °C with 1 μl (200 units) of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 4 μg of 25 mer/oligo(dT), 80 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, 2500 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μl of H2O, and 6 μl of 5× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 30 μl. After 1 h, 1 μl of Superscript II reverse transcriptase was added to the reaction mixture. The resulting [33P]cDNA probes were purified with ProbeQuant G-50 Micro columns (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. After counting, probes with a total activity higher than 2 × 107 cpm were the only ones to be hybridized. Mouse Genefilters (GF400 from ResGen, Invitrogen) were used for profiling expression analysis. Genefilters contain 5185 genes (75% are expressed sequence tags (ESTs)). The membranes were pretreated with boiled 0.5% SDS for 10 min. Prehybridization was performed for 4 h at 42 °C in MicroHyb hybridization solution (ResGen) with 5 μg of denatured mouse Cot-1 and 4 μg of poly(dA) as blocking reagents. The column-purified and denatured probes were then added and hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h. After hybridization, the membranes were successively washed twice for 10 min at 50 °C in roller tubes containing 2× standard saline citrate solution (SSC) and 1% SDS. The last two washes were carried out in a plastic box with horizontal shaking: 2× SSC and 1% SDS for 20 min at 50 °C and 0.5× SSC and 1% SDS for 15 min at 55 °C. The membranes were then exposed to low energy phosphorimage screens for 2 days. Images were acquired using PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Biosciences, Sunnyvale, CA), and analyzed with IMAGENE 4.0 (Biodiscovery, Marina del Rey) and Excel (Microsoft) software. Each hybridization was performed with independent RNA samples (cell preparation and RNA extraction). For each hybridization, the mean of local background incremented with two S.D. was subtracted from each spot's intensity. After this correction, all positive values were considered as significant and transformed into log10values. Hybridizations were then normalized by dividing the intensity of each spot by the mean of the control spot intensity of total genomic DNA (Tg) spotted by the manufacturer onto membrane. Profile analyses were performed using J-Express 2.0 software (Molmine, Ref. 25Dysvik B. Jonassen I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 369-370Google Scholar) and ExpressionSieveTM 1.0 lite (BioSieve). “Random” profile was created using the RAND Excel function (Microsoft). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between means was evaluated using the unpaired Student's t test. In the time course experiments, statistical significance was evaluated using one-way ANOVA analysis. All RNA samples were purified from murine cells to avoid mismatch recognition between the labeled probe derived from these samples and the mouse cDNA spotted onto matrix. To obtain the best physiological relevance, we used several cell lines for one phenotype as well as cells freshly isolated from mouse tissues. However, for one phenotype, data from immortalized or non-immortalized cells were individualized. 3T3-L1, 3T3-F442A, Ob17, Hgfu preadipocyte, and RAW 264.7, J774.2 murine cell lines were the most often used to investigate adipocyte and macrophage properties, respectively. Preadipocytes were enriched from SVF cells by plating and culturing for 48 h. To exclude the possibility of contaminating macrophages, we tested for F4/80 or Mac-1-positive cells. Less than 1% of SVF cells were expressing these antigens (data not shown). The independent hybridizations corresponding to each phenotype class were gathered together to build height representative profiles, named metaprofiles (Table I). To build them, genes were first filtered to retain only those whom expression was detected in more than 50% of hybridizations. The mean of their positive hybridization values were calculated and retained. The resulting dataset was again filtered to normalize the number of positive genes and to exclude genes that were always negative (2040 of 5185 initial genes) or positive (133) in all metaprofiles.Table IExperimental design of metaprofilesPhenotypePreadipocyteAdipocyteMacrophageLiverMetaprofilePreadipocyte lineSVFAdipocyte lineAdipocyteMacrophage linePeritoneal macrophageLiverHybridizations3T3-L1 3T3-F442A Ob17 HgfuSVF cells in primary cultureDifferentiated 3T3-F442AIsolated adipocytesRAW 264.7 J774.2Peritoneal exudated cellsTissue samples Open table in a new tab At this stage and to test the significance of clustering, we included a “random” metaprofile in the dataset. In this metaprofile, the values of hybridizations were distributed at random. The resulting dataset contained 468 genes. Before clustering, column variances were normalized (J-Express, Plug-ins). The metaprofiles in the dataset were clustered with a hierarchical classification algorithm based on Pearson's correlation distance (d = 1 − r) and average linkage. The clustering algorithm separated metaprofiles into two distinct clusters (Fig. 1). The first cluster included liver and random metaprofiles. As expected, the two negative controls random and liver metaprofiles were the most isolated profiles with a low similarity between them (d > 0.8). The second cluster contained all cellular metaprofiles. Thus, the macrophage phenotypes, which corresponded to a differentiated phenotype, were closer to the preadipocyte metaprofiles (d ≤ 0.5) than to the metaprofiles of differentiated adipocytes (from fatty tissue or also preadipocyte cell lines) (d > 0.5). Within the subcluster, preadipocyte or macrophage metaprofiles were systematically paired according to the nature of the sample (immortalized cell lines versusnon-immortalized cells). This common behavior suggested a strong similarity between the two phenotypes, although the identification of gene clusters preferentially expressed in one metaprofile demonstrated that they were not identical. However, because of this close resemblance, the question of putative conversion of preadipocytes into macrophages emerged from this analysis. To address this question, we decided to transplant labeled preadipocytes into an environment suitable for supporting the macrophage phenotype (i.e. the peritoneal cavity). Preadipocytes were labeled with DAPI before injection into the peritoneal cavity. Two controls were performed to demonstrate the absence of staining of endogenous peritoneal cells by contaminating DAPI during injection of DAPI-labeled cells. First, supernatants of labeling washings and highly concentrated DAPI solution (500 μl) were directly injected into the peritoneal cavity. Second, DAPI-labeled preadipocytes and non-labeled peritoneal macrophages were co-cultured for 2 days in 2 chambers separated by a track-etched membrane (pore size, 0.4 μm). No contaminating staining was observed at any time in either case. Furthermore, we checked that DAPI had no effect on the preadipocyte phenotype, its proliferation and differentiation process in our conditions (data not shown). Before injection, 28 ± 4% of SVF cells were phagocytizing with a phagocytic index of 6 ± 1 and less than 1% were expressing the mature macrophage antigens F4/80 or Mac-1. Twenty-four hours after their injection into the peritoneal cavity, 15 ± 2% of peritoneal cells were DAPI+, and the phagocytic activity of these cells reached 92 ± 1% with a phagocytic index of 18 ± 3. Similar results were obtained 6 days after injection (Fig. 2, A andB). The time course of these changes was investigated. As soon as 24 h after cell transplantation, 61 ± 1% and 81 ± 3% of DAPI+ cells were strongly stained with antibodies against F4/80 and Mac-1 respectively (Fig. 2,C and D). All values were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those measured on non-injected SVF cells and were not significantly different from those of peritoneal macrophages (98 ± 1% of macrophages presented phagocytic activity with a phagocytic index of 19 ± 1; 63 ± 7% and 70 ± 4% were F4/80+ and Mac-1+, respectively). Afterward, these values remained at this level whatever the time of sampling. To determine whether a clonal preadipocyte population had similar behavior, immortalized 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used. In basal conditions, the phagocytic activity and index of 3T3-L1 were 26 ± 5% and 3 ± 1 yeast/cell, respectively (see below). None of these cells expressed F4/80 or Mac-1 (data not shown). Six hours after injection, 23 ± 2% of peritoneal cells were DAPI+. Phagocytic activity and index of these cells dramatically increased and reached 81 ± 6% and 15 ± 1 respectively (Fig.3 A). 72 ± 3% of DAPI+ cells expressed F4/80, and similar values were observed for Mac-1 expression (Fig. 3 B). No further significant change of these parameters was observed whatever the time of sampling (Fig. 3, A and B). All values were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those observed in basal conditions and were not significantly different from those of peritoneal macrophages. The expression of CD80, CD86, and MHCII was then investigated. CD80, CD86, and MHCII antibodies stained 62 ± 4%, 63 ± 5%, and 20.1 ± 0.1% of peritoneal cells respectively (Fig. 3 C). No staining with any antibodies was detected in preadipocytes before injection. Twenty-four hours after peritoneal injection of 3T3-L1 cells, 53 ± 10% and 68 ± 3% of DAPI+ cells expressed CD80 and CD86 respectively (Fig. 3 C). The values obtained with CD80 and CD86 were not significantly different from those of peritoneal cells. Similar results were obtained with CD45 antigen, which is considered as pan-hematopoietic (data not shown). Under the same conditions, MHCII was never detected on 3T3L1 DAPI+ cells (Fig. 3 C) as well as on primary adipocyte precursors (data not shown). To confirm these results with other labeling techniques, similar transplantation experiments were performed with 3T3-L1 after adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GFP (GFP+). After overnight infection with 70 plaque-forming units/cell of the CMV-GFP adenovirus, 70% of the cultured 3T3-L1 cells expressed GFP. The absence of free viral particles in the injection medium was checked by injection of adenovirus-infected 3T3-L1 supernatant into the peritoneal cavity. No GFP+ peritoneal cells were observed 1 day after supernatant injection. One day after peritoneal injection, the changes in GFP+ cells were similar to those observed in DAPI+ cells (Fig. 4). These observations confirmed the results obtained with the DAPI-labeled cells. DAPI+ or GFP+ 3T3-L1 cells were co-cultured with peritoneal macrophages either together on Lab-tek slides or in two chambers separated by a track-etched membrane. After 1 day in co-culture without separation membrane, phagocytic activity of the stained preadipocytes significantly increased and reached 45 ± 5% (Table II). In addition, after co-culture with peritoneal macrophages, F4/80 and Mac-1 positive preadipocytes were detected (8.3 ± 0.3% and 9 ± 1% of DAPI+ cells (Table II). When preadipocytes were co-cultured with C2C12 myoblasts, no change of the preadipocyte phenotype was noted. When preadipocytes were co-cultured without cell-to-cell contact, in the 2-chamber system, no change in phagocytic activity or expression of macrophage antigens was observed (Table II).Table IIMacrophage contact is necessary for specific conversion of preadipocytes into macrophages3T3-L1 controls3T3-L1/Mph co-cultured non-separated3T3-L1/C2C12 co-cultured non-separated3T3-L1/Mph co-cultured separated%%%%Phagocytic activity22 ± 745 ± 5*20 ± 526 ± 5F4/8008.3 ± 0.3**00Mac-109 ± 1**00Preadipocytes and macrophages were co-cultured together or separated by a track-etched membrane.

Values represent the percentage of phagocytic cells or F4/80+ or Mac-1+ cells in the total number of DAPI+ cells. Results are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 and **, p< 0.01 versus 3T3-L1 controls. To test the similarity between cells of adipocyte lineage (i.e. preadipocytes and adipocytes) and macrophages without focusing on specific genes, we decided to use the transcriptome profiling approach. First, differences highlighted by our analysis between immortalized and non-immortalized cells, whatever their phenotype, confirmed the previous report and a posterioriour approach (18Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Google Scholar). The result of profiling is unambiguous. Indeed, macrophages are genomically closer to adipocyte precursors than to adipocytes. The link between a differentiated phenotype, i.e. macrophage, and proliferating precursor cells excluded any artifactual clustering due to proliferating potential. This closeness is true for phenotypes derived from cell lines as well as those derived from cells purified from mice. This argues for close resemblance between preadipocytes and macrophages even though each metaprofile can be identified by specific gene clusters under standard conditions. This conclusion is consistent with our previous work (15Cousin B. Munoz O. Andre M. Fontanilles A.M. Dani C. Cousin J.L. Laharrague P. Casteilla L. Penicaud L. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 305-312Google Scholar). The strong proximity of preadipocyte and macrophage phenotypes raises the question of whether preadipocytes have the potential to transdifferentiate into macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we chose to graft preadipocytes into a site that is suitable for supporting the macrophage phenotype, i.e. the peritoneal cavity. Recent implantation studies have used the fluorescent nuclear marker DAPI to trace implanted cells (26Dorfman J. Duong M. Zibaitis A. Pelletier M.P. Shum-Tim D. Li C. Chiu R.C. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. 1998; 116: 744-751Google Scholar, 27Pye D. Watt D.J. J. Anat. 2001; 198: 163-173Google Scholar). DAPI, which binds strongly to adenine-thymidine-rich sites in nuclear DNA, is easy to use with all cell types whatever their proliferation state, and labels 100% of treated cells. These characteristics are very convenient for labeling cells in primary culture, which are often refractory to transfection or infection. An alternative would be to use adenovirus. Adenovirus has been extensively used to transiently express protein in infected cells (28de Martin R. Raidl M. Hofer E. Binder B.R. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 493-495Google Scholar), but it is not as effective as DAPI, especially for preadipocyte cell lines and SVF, and leads in vivo to inflammatory responses (29Yang Y. Li Q. Ertl H.C. Wilson J.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2004-2015Google Scholar, 30Tripathy S.K. Black H.B. Goldwasser E. Leiden J.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 545-550Google Scholar). However, after injection, the labeling of host cells caused by viral particles attached to the membrane of infected cells cannot be excluded. For all these reasons, CMV-GFP adenovirus was only used to check that our results were independent of the labeling technique. After injection into the peritoneal cavity, most of the SVF cells as well as 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were very rapidly converted into cells which displayed the functional (high phagocytic capacity) and antigenic properties (expression of F4/80, Mac-1, and CD45) of neighboring peritoneal macrophages. This strongly argues for a phenotypic conversion of preadipocytes into typical macrophages. To complete this phenotype, the expression of proteins associated with antigen-presenting function was compared with that of peritoneal macrophages. Once again, CD80 and CD86 antibodies stained similar percentages of DAPI+ and peritoneal exudated cells. The peritoneal cavity of mouse can educate preadipocytes into phagocytosing cell that express the immunologically significant constimulation molecules B7.1 and B7.2 (CD80 and CD86). The effect of peritoneal cavity on the preadipocyte phenotype is consistent with numerous studies on cellular plasticity in which the environmental and pathological context strongly direct the fate of injected cells whatever their tissue origins (31Ferrari G. Cusella-De Angelis G. Coletta M. Paolucci E. Stornaiuolo A. Cossu G. Mavilio F. Science. 1998; 279: 1528-1530Google Scholar, 32Galli R. Borello U. Gritti A. Minasi M.G. Bjornson C. Coletta M. Mora M. De Angelis M.G. Fiocco R. Cossu G. Vescovi A.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 986-991Google Scholar, 33Condorelli G. Borello U. De Angelis L. Latronico M. Sirabella D. Coletta M. Galli R. Balconi G. Follenzi A. Frati G. Cusella De Angelis M.G. Gioglio L. Amuchastegui S. Adorini L. Naldini L. Vescovi A. Dejana E. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10733-10738Google Scholar). An intriguing point is that differentiated cells present in the cavity,i.e. peritoneal macrophages, can induce the phenotypic transformation of precursor cells into their own phenotype. Although this conversion is very low in vitro, it is specific because no F4/80 or Mac-1 staining was detected when co-culture was performed with the C2C12 myoblastic cell line. Very recently, it was shown that endothelial cells cultivated with cardiomyocytes could differentiate into cardiomyocytes (33Condorelli G. Borello U. De Angelis L. Latronico M. Sirabella D. Coletta M. Galli R. Balconi G. Follenzi A. Frati G. Cusella De Angelis M.G. Gioglio L. Amuchastegui S. Adorini L. Naldini L. Vescovi A. Dejana E. Cossu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10733-10738Google Scholar). This suggests that differentiated cells are themselves strong inducers of their own differentiation program. In our study, direct contact between preadipocytes and macrophages seems to be required to achieve this phenotypic conversion, as demonstrated by the experiments using track-etched membrane separation. The involvement of cell-to-cell contact is not very surprising and underlines its role in many differentiation processes (34Prosper F. Verfaillie C.M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 69: 307-316Google Scholar, 35Albelda S.M. Buck C.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2868-2880Google Scholar). The nature of the observed phenotype change is very difficult to define precisely. It in fact corresponds to a conversion process between two lineages that were previously thought to be independent. Although it has been shown that preadipocyte cell lines could be induced to differentiate into other cell types, such as osteoblasts (36Ji X. Chen D. Xu C. Harris S.E. Mundy G.R. Yoneda T. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2000; 18: 132-139Google Scholar), the rapid kinetics of change could suggest a transdifferentiation process or/and a stronger lineage relationship between adipocyte progenitors and macrophages than expected. Our study demonstrates that adipose progenitors can rapidly and efficiently convert into typical macrophages. This raises the possibility that the preadipocyte could have been changed into a cell capable of costimulating a T cell. Such interaction may influence the biology of both cell types and have grave implications in immunologic as well as metabolic pathogenic states. Increasing cross-talk between both fields are reported and emphasize the importance of inflammation in various metabolic disorders as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and obesity (16Cousin B. Andre M.

The signals emanating from growth factor receptors determine the size, number, and turnover rate of cells within a given tissue (1Conlon I. Raff M. Cell. 1999; 96: 235-244Google Scholar). A major pathway that controls cell growth and survival in response to the activation of growth factor receptors is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K1/Akt) pathway (2Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 65-71Google Scholar). Studies of the PI3K/Akt pathway in model organisms such asDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have established the importance of this pathway in controlling the number and size of cells within an organism and also in controlling the size and longevity of the entire organism. In vertebrates, constitutively active oncogenic forms of both PI3K and Akt have been characterized in murine and avian retroviruses, and inactivating mutations in PTEN (a phosphatase that opposes the action of PI3K) are prevalent in many types of human tumors (3Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Google Scholar, 4Chang H.W. Aoki M. Fruman D. Auger K.R. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Cantley L.C. Roberts T.M. Vogt P.K.

Tavtigian S.V. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Google Scholar).Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway stimulates growth and survival via its actions on a number of Akt substrates, including the FOXO family transcription factors Bad, GSK-3, mTOR, and tuberin. Active FOXO family transcription factors promote the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis such as p27kip1 and Bim (6Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Google Scholar, 7Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9138-9148Google Scholar). One mechanism by which Akt promotes cell survival is by phosphorylating FOXO family transcription factors, which inactivates them and prevents the transcription of proapoptotic molecules. Recently Akt has also been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate a negative regulator of cell size, tuberin (9Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar, 10Gao X. Zhang Y. Arrazola P. Hino O. Kobayashi T. Yeung R.S. Ru B. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Google Scholar, 11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J.

In conjunction with its binding partner hamartin, increased tuberin protein levels negatively regulate cell size, possibly by inhibiting the phosphorylation and activation of mTOR or p70S6K. Phosphorylation by Akt prevents tuberin-dependent declines in cell size.In growth factor-dependent cells, the removal of growth factors triggers cellular atrophy and the initiation of programmed cell death (13Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Google Scholar). Activation of Akt inhibits both of these processes, suggesting that Akt can inhibit mediators of both cell atrophy and cell death (14Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Google Scholar). In analyzing the effects of Akt activation on downstream targets involved in the regulation of cell size and survival, we show here that the activation of Akt results in a decline in total protein levels of tuberin and FOXO3a. The Akt-stimulated decline in tuberin correlated with a decline in the protein level of its binding partner, hamartin, suggesting that the tuberin-hamartin complex is coordinately regulated by Akt. Inhibition of the proteasome resulted in a recovery in the protein levels of tuberin, FOXO1, and FOXO3a and triggered a general accumulation of Akt substrates. Physiologic activation of the endogenous PI3K/Akt pathway through the IL-3 receptor in the presence of proteasome inhibitors resulted in prolonged phosphorylation of tuberin and FOXO3a. IL-3 stimulation triggered the ubiquitination of a number of potential Akt substrates, indicating that Akt-dependent degradation of substrates may be induced through their ubiquitination. Together the data indicate that activation of Akt targets the substrates of Akt for degradation in the proteasome.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStable transfectants expressing constitutively active myrAkt under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter were established using the nontransformed IL-3-dependent murine hematopoietic cell line FL5.12 with the intent of identifying and purifying Akt substrates involved in the control of growth and survival (Fig. 1, A and B). A low level of myrAkt is expressed in the absence of doxycycline. However, the addition of doxycycline to myrAkt-expressing cells results in a rapid and prolonged increase in Akt activity with concomitant increases in cell size and the induction of growth factor-independent cell survival (Fig. 1C). Disappointingly, using antibodies specific for Akt phosphorylation sites, doxycycline induction of Akt failed to induce an increase in the number or intensity of immunoreactive bands on immunoblots. This result prompted an examination of the expression of specific Akt substrates. The Akt consensus phosphorylation sequence identified tuberin as a potential Akt substrate, which has been confirmed recently in several studies (9Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar,11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar, 18Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35364-35370Google Scholar). Analysis of tuberin expression revealed a decline in tuberin protein levels as Akt activity was induced (Fig.1D). A decline in the protein levels of the tuberin binding partner hamartin was also observed in myrAkt cells, and this decline was consistently accompanied by the appearance of a faster migrating species in hamartin immunoblots, suggesting the generation of a hamartin degradation product in cells with activated Akt.In IL-3-dependent cells, growth factor withdrawal rapidly induces a decline in cell size followed by the induction of programmed cell death. Expression of Bcl-xL prevents the induction of cell death without altering the kinetics of cell atrophy, permitting analysis of cell atrophy in the absence of complicating effects of apoptosis (13Rathmell J.C. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Frauwirth K.A. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 683-692Google Scholar). Because tuberin and hamartin function in complex to negatively regulate cell size (20Nellist M. van Slegtenhorst M.A. Goedbloed M. van den Ouweland A.M. Halley D.J. van der Sluijs P. J. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 105: 345-355Google Scholar), we compared the effect of IL-3 withdrawal and the induction of atrophy on tuberin and hamartin protein expression levels in Bcl-xL-expressing and myrAkt-expressing cells. IL-3 withdrawal had little effect on tuberin and hamartin protein levels. However, induction of Akt in the absence of other components of IL-3 signal transduction still led to a near complete decline in both hamartin and tuberin levels (Fig.1E). The declines in tuberin and hamartin levels in cells with activated Akt corresponded with increased cell size both in the presence and absence of IL-3 (Fig. 1, F andG).Phosphorylation can target proteins for degradation by the proteasome (24Deshaies R.J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Cell. 2001; 107: 819-822Google Scholar). To determine whether proteasomal degradation was involved in the decline in tuberin protein levels in myrAkt-expressing cells, the proteasome inhibitor ALLN was added to cultures. In vector control and Bcl-xL-expressing cells, the addition of ALLN had little effect on tuberin protein levels. However, ALLN triggered a substantial recovery of tuberin protein in myrAkt-expressing cells, suggesting that proteasomal degradation of tuberin was triggered by activated Akt (Fig.2A). In addition to inhibiting proteasomal degradation, ALLN inhibits the activities of other proteases within the cell. To verify the involvement of the proteasome in the Akt-dependent decline in tuberin levels, cells were treated with ALLM, an analogue of ALLN that shares the ability to inhibit proteases but has poor affinity for the proteasome (25Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Google Scholar). In contrast to ALLN, ALLM treatment did not result in the recovery of tuberin protein levels, indicating that the ability to inhibit the proteasome is required to prevent degradation of tuberin (Fig.2B). Further evidence supporting a role for the proteasome in Akt-dependent declines in tuberin levels was obtained by treating cells with epoxomicin, an irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome with a mechanism of action that is distinct from ALLN (26Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 739-758Google Scholar). Similar to ALLN, the addition of epoxomicin to Akt-expressing cells resulted in a recovery in tuberin protein levels (Fig. 2B). Thus, Akt stimulates proteasomal degradation of tuberin.Figure 2Akt-induced proteasomal degradation of tuberin. A, cells were cultured with doxycycline in the presence and absence of IL-3.

Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar, 11Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Google Scholar). To determine whether other Akt substrates are also targeted for degradation by the proteasome, vector control, Bcl-xL-expressing, and myrAkt-expressing cells were treated with ALLN and probed in an immunoblot with an antiserum specific for phosphorylated residues in the context of the consensus Akt substrate motif (9Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the number of immunoreactive protein species was lower in Akt-expressing cells than in control or Bcl-xL-expressing cells. However, a number of bands containing potential Akt phosphorylation sites were induced by treatment with ALLN in all three lines, and the magnitude of induction was greatest in cells expressing activated Akt (Fig.3A). The accumulation of Akt substrates in control cells cultured in ALLN and IL-3 suggests that the IL-3 receptor activation of the endogenous PI3K/Akt pathway is sufficient to cause degradation of Akt substrates. These data suggest that Akt may target a number of substrates for proteasomal degradation, and the extent of proteasomal degradation correlates with the extent of Akt activation.Figure 3Putative Akt substrates are targeted for proteasomal degradation. A, cells were cultured with doxycycline in the presence of IL-3. Eight h after the addition of Me2SO (−) or ALLN (+), total cell lysates were prepared and analyzed in an immunoblot using an antiserum specific for phosphorylated residues that match the Akt consensus motif.Arrows indicate phosphoproteins that were stabilized by the addition of proteasome inhibitors. Vec., vector control.B, the lysates described in panel A were probed in tuberin, FOXO1, FOXO3a, and actin immunoblots. Results are representative of three experiments. C, vector control and Akt-expressing cells cultured in the presence of doxycycline were treated with vehicle control (−), ALLN, or ALLN+ 10 ॖm LY294002, as indicated. Total cell lysates were probed in immunoblots for FOXO3a phosphothreonine 26 (p-FOXO3a), FOXO3a, or actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because ALLN promoted the accumulation of potential Akt substrates in the 50–90-kDa range, the effects of proteasome inhibitors on protein levels of FOXO family transcription factors were evaluated as a test of this hypothesis. Expression of activated Akt triggered a decline in protein levels of both FOXO1 and FOXO3a, and treatment of cells with ALLN triggered a recovery in protein levels for both transcription factors (Fig. 3B). In lysates from vector control cells the addition of ALLN triggered a significant increase in FOXO3a protein levels, specifically in a slower migrating form of the protein. This result suggested that IL-3 receptor stimulation was sufficient to trigger endogenous Akt phosphorylation and degradation of FOXO3a. To test this possibility, vector control and myrAkt cells were cultured in the presence and absence of ALLN and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. As shown previously, culture in the presence of ALLN caused an accumulation of a slow migrating form of FOXO3a. The addition of LY294002 prevented IL-3-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3a and caused an increase in the mobility of total FOXO3a protein (Fig. 3C). The addition of LY294002 had little effect on the phosphorylation or mobility of FOXO3a in cells expressing activated Akt. These data indicate that the effects of LY294002 on FOXO3a protein mobility in response to IL-3 depend on inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Taken together, the results suggest that protein levels of both FOXO1 and FOXO3a are regulated in response to the activation of Akt in a proteasome-dependent manner.The effects on FOXO3a protein mobility suggested that the activation of endogenous Akt by the IL-3 receptor can influence protein stability. To further explore whether proteasomal degradation of Akt substrates is induced at physiologic levels of Akt activation, we examined the effects of IL-3-induced Akt activation on the expression and phosphorylation status of tuberin and FOXO3a after the addition of IL-3 to growth factor-deprived cells. IL-3 was added to cells that had been pretreated for 30 min with vehicle control or epoxomicin. We have previously demonstrated under these conditions that IL-3 causes a rapid induction of PI3K-dependent Akt activity that is detectable within 5 min and persists for more than an hour (14Plas D.R. Talapatra S. Edinger A.L. Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12041-12048Google Scholar). Total cell lysates were isolated at several time points and probed in immunoblots with antisera that recognize Akt phosphorylation sites within tuberin and FOXO3a. IL-3-stimulated phosphorylation of tuberin and FOXO3a was maximal at 10 min followed by a decay in phosphorylation and protein levels over time (Fig.4A). Treatment of cells with epoxomicin resulted in the accumulation of phosphorylated forms of both tuberin and FOXO3a at later time points, suggesting that phosphorylated tuberin and FOXO3a are targeted for proteasomal degradation after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 4A). At later time points, IL-3 stimulation caused a mild decline in tuberin protein levels that was abrogated by the addition of epoxomicin (compare Fig. 4A, lanes 9 and10, with lanes 1 and 2). As seen in ALLN-treated cells, FOXO3a was characterized by heterogeneous mobility at early time points after IL-3 stimulation, and this persisted in epoxomicin-treated cells (Figs. 3, B and C, and 4A).Figure 4Proteasomal degradation of Akt substrates after IL-3 stimulation. A, FL5.12 cells were withdrawn from IL-3 for 4 h followed by a 30-min incubation in Me2SO (−) or 100 nm epoxomicin (Epox.)(+). Cells were then stimulated with 4 ng/ml IL-3 for the indicated time before lysis. Total cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot analysis with antisera recognizing tuberin phosphothreonine 1462 (p-Tuberin), FOXO3a phosphothreonine 26 (p-FOXO3a), tuberin, FOXO3a, or actin. Results are representative of three experiments. B, doxycycline-inducible clones of either wild type human FOXO1 or human FOXO1 (huFOXO1) with three Akt phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (FOXO1-3A) were established in FL5.12. These clones were infected with a retroviral vector encoding GFP alone (GFP) or GFP and myrAkt (Akt). GFP-positive cells were isolated and cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline for 24 h to induce human FOXO1, and FOXO1 protein levels were assessed by immunoblot. Levels of phospho-Akt were measured in cells as a control for the efficiency of retroviral transduction of myrAkt.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that direct Akt phosphorylation is required for Akt-induced protein degradation, we experimentally introduced tetracycline-inducible constructs of either wild type human FOXO1 or a human FOXO1 in which Akt phosphorylation sites had been mutated to alanine (FOXO1-3A) into FL5.12 cells (17Tang E.D.

GFP-positive cells were isolated by cell sorting and expanded in the presence or absence of doxycycline. In cells expressing wild type FOXO1, expression of myrAkt led to increased levels of phosphorylated Akt and a concomitant decline in the level of FOXO1 protein. In cells expressing FOXO1-3A in which major Akt phosphorylation sites have been mutated, the effect of myrAkt on the proteins levels of the FOXO1-3A protein was blunted compared with the effect of Akt on wild type FOXO1 (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that Akt-induced declines in FOXO protein levels require the presence of Akt phosphorylation sites in the substrate.The 26 S proteasome degrades proteins that are conjugated to polyubiquitin chains. Akt-induced degradation of substrates in the proteasome may be stimulated by an increase in the ubiquitination of these proteins. To determine whether tuberin ubiquitination is increased in cells expressing activated Akt, ubiquitinated proteins were enriched using an affinity matrix consisting of glutathioneS-transferase fused to the ubiquitin-binding UBA domains of Rad23 (27Chen L. Shinde U. Ortolan T.G. Madura K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 933-938Google Scholar, 28Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Google Scholar). Tuberin was enriched among ubiquitinated proteins isolated from epoxomicin-treated myrAkt cells compared with vector control cells (cultured in the absence of IL-3), indicating that increased Akt activity is sufficient to cause an increase in tuberin ubiquitination (Fig. 5A).Figure 5Akt induces the ubiquitination of tuberin and other putative substrates. A, vector control (Vec.) and myrAkt (Akt) cells were removed from IL-3 for 1 h and incubated in the presence and absence of epoxomicin for an additional hour. Ubiquitinated proteins were isolated from total cell lysates using the Rad23 UBA domains bound to agarose. After three washes, bound proteins were resolved by gel electrophoresis and probed in an anti-tuberin immunoblot. The blot was stripped and reprobed in an anti-ubiquitin immunoblot to control for efficiency of enrichment of ubiquitinated proteins. B, vector control (V) and myrAkt (A) cells were removed from IL-3 for 2 h followed by a 30-min incubation in vehicle control (Me2SO), 100 nm epoxomicin (Epox.), or epoxomicin and 10 ॖm LY294002 (LY + Epox.). Cells were stimulated with IL-3 for 1 h, and total cell lysates were prepared. Putative Akt substrates were detected using the Akt substrate antiserum (top). Ubiquitinated Akt substrates that were detectable in epoxomicin-treated vector control cells and epoxomicin-treated myrAkt cells, but not vector control cells treated with LY294002, are marked with a star. A potential ubiquitinated Akt substrate detected in only myrAkt cells is marked with an arrow. The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-ubiquitin as a loading control (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether activation of the endogenous PI3K/Akt pathway by the IL-3 receptor can cause a generalized increase in the ubiquitination of Akt substrates, vector control and myrAkt cells were stimulated with IL-3 in the presence and absence of epoxomicin and LY294002 for 60 min, a time point at which degradation of tuberin and FOXO3a was observed previously (Fig. 4A). Akt substrates were detected using the Akt substrate antiserum in fractions enriched for ubiquitinated proteins using the Rad23 UBA domains (Fig.5B). In vector control cells, ubiquitinated Akt substrates were detected in lysates from epoxomicin-treated cells but not from cells treated with vehicle control, suggesting that ubiquitinated Akt substrates are processed through the proteasome on stimulation of the endogenous PI3K/Akt pathway with IL-3. The addition of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor that blocks the activation of Akt by the IL-3 receptor, prevented the accumulation of ubiquitinated Akt substrates in epoxomicin-treated cells, suggesting that activation of Akt was required for ubiquitination of these proteins. Expression of activated Akt-enriched ubiquitinated proteins detected using the Akt substrate antiserum (Fig. 5B). The addition of LY294002 reduced but did not eliminate the detection of Akt substrates among ubiquitinated proteins in myrAkt cells, suggesting that the effect of LY294002 in vector control cells required inactivation of Akt. By combining the data obtained from vector control and myrAkt cells, ubiquitinated Akt substrates can be identified as proteins that are 1) detected in epoxomicin-treated vector control cells, 2) not detected in vector control cells treated with LY294002 and epoxomicin, and 3) detected in myrAkt cells treated with either epoxomicin or LY294002 and epoxomicin. Proteins meeting these criteria are marked with an asterisk (Fig. 5B). An additional potential ubiquitinated Akt substrate was also identified only in lysates from myrAkt cells. These data suggest that a number of proteins are phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in an Akt-dependent manner in response to stimulation with IL-3 or expression of myrAkt, resulting in proteasome-dependent degradation of Akt substrates.Previous reports have suggested that Akt phosphorylation of substrates can alter their subcellular distribution, induce their association with 14-3-3 proteins, and/or inhibit their catalytic activity (29Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Google Scholar). The data presented here show that an additional effect of Akt phosphorylation is the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of the substrates of Akt. Prolonged expression of myrAkt caused proteasome-dependent declines in tuberin and FOXO protein levels, which were recapitulated to a lesser degree by stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by the IL-3 receptor. Differences in the magnitude of the effects of myrAkt and the IL-3 receptor on tuberin and FOXO protein levels may be a result of the relative levels of Akt activation between the two stimuli, as shown in Fig. 1A. The induction of proteasomal degradation of tuberin and FOXO3a by Akt may serve as prototypic examples of a general mechanism used by Akt in the coordinated regulation of cell growth and survival. This hypothesis is supported by the data presented in Fig. 3A, which indicate that the phosphorylation of a number of Akt substrates is stabilized by the addition of proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, endogenous levels of Akt are sufficient to cause both ubiquitination and degradation of substrates (Figs. 3B, 4A, and5B), indicating that these effects can be induced in a physiologic context.Recent findings show that Akt can control the expression levels of proteins, such as p53, the androgen receptor, and insulin receptor substrate-1 (30Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1299-1303Google Scholar, 31Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Google Scholar, 32Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Akt targets substrates such as tuberin and FOXO proteins for ubiquitination is unknown. Akt has been shown to activate the ubiquitin ligase activity of murine double minute-2, and murine double minute-2 activity has been implicated in Akt-stimulated increases in androgen receptor and p53 degradation (30Gottlieb T.M. Leal J.F. Seger R. Taya Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1299-1303Google Scholar, 31Lin H.K. Wang L. Hu Y.C. Altuwaijri S. Chang C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4037-4048Google Scholar, 33Zhou B.P. Liao Y. Xia W. Zou Y. Spohn B. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 973-982Google Scholar). Alternatively, an E3 ubiquitin ligase may specifically target proteins with phosphorylated residues within Akt substrate motifs in a manner analogous to the regulation of protein stability by ubiquitin ligases capable of binding to proteins phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (34Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Google Scholar).The PI3K/Akt pathway plays a critical role in promoting cell growth and survival downstream of growth factor receptors. Much of the growth and survival activities of Akt have been attributed to the ability of Akt to inhibit the function of proteins that mediate cellular atrophy and programmed cell death. Using tuberin and FOXO3a as examples, we have shown that Akt targets its substrates for degradation via the proteasome. We propose that proteasomal degradation of substrates may therefore represent a central mechanism by which Akt acts to promote cell growth and survival. Metazoan cell size, survival, and proliferation are coordinately regulated by the availability of extrinsic growth factors that govern these processes through their control of intracellular signal transduction cascades. The signals emanating from growth factor receptors determine the size, number, and turnover rate of cells within a given tissue (1Conlon I. Raff M. Cell. 1999; 96: 235-244Google Scholar). A major pathway that controls cell growth and survival in response to the activation of growth factor receptors is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K1/Akt) pathway (2Kozma S.C."

In contrast to ATR, loss of ATM does not affect the phosphorylation of these or other targets in response to hypoxia. However, hypoxia within tumors is often transient and is inevitably followed by reoxygenation. We hypothesized that ATR activity is induced under hypoxic conditions because of growth arrest and ATM activity increases in response to the oxidative stress of reoxygenation. Using the comet assay to detect DNA damage, we find that reoxygenation induced significant amounts of DNA damage. Two ATR/ATM targets, p53 serine 15 and histone H2AX, were both phosphorylated in response to hypoxia in an ATR-dependent manner. These phosphorylations were then maintained in response to reoxygenation-induced DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner. The reoxygenation-induced p53 serine 15 phosphorylation was inhibited by the addition ofN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), indicating that free radical-induced DNA damage was mediated by reactive oxygen species. Taken together these data implicate both ATR and ATM as critical roles in the response of hypoxia and reperfusion in solid tumors.

The mammalian response to hypoxia is complex and varies at different oxygen tensions (1Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1834-1843Google Scholar). These include the induction of hypoxia-responsive genes by the transcription factors early growth response-1 (EGR1), AP-1, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1 (2Nishi H N.K. Johnson A.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 827-834Google Scholar, 3Laderoute K.R. Calaoagan J.M. Knapp A.M. Mendonca H.L. Johnson R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1134-1139Google Scholar). HIF is a heterodimer that consists of Hif1α and ॆ subunits that bind to the sequence 5′-RCGTG-3′ (4Miyazaki K. Kawamoto T. Tanimoto K. Nishiyama M. Honda H. Kato Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47014-47021Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions HIF-1α is rapidly degraded when it is bound to the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein that targets it for ubiquitination (5Kondo K. Klco J. Nakamura E. Lechpammer M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 237-246Google Scholar, 6Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E121-E123Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions HIF-1α is hydroxylated at a conserved proline residue, number 564, by a family of highly conserved 4-prolyl hydroxylases (7Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1441-1445Google Scholar, 8Chan D.A. Sutphin P.D. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40112-40117Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions the activity of this oxygen-sensitive hydroxylase is repressed, and HIF-1α is unable to complex with VHL, which in turn leads to its increase in stability. In contrast to HIF-1, which is stabilized at 27 oxygen, the protein product of the p53 tumor suppressor gene also accumulates in hypoxic cells but requires more stringent hypoxic conditions (1Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1834-1843Google Scholar). Hypoxia-induced p53 activates a cytochrome c-mediated apoptotic pathway that can act as a selective pressure for the expansion of tumor cells with either inactive or mutant p53 (9Alarcon R.M. Denko N.C. Giaccia A.J. Novartis Found. Symp. 2001; 240: 115-128Google Scholar, 10Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p53 accumulates under hypoxic conditions has been attributed to both a decrease in mdm2 levels (11Alarcon R. Koumenis C. Geyer R.K. Maki C.G. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6046-6051Google Scholar) and increased translation. mdm2 acts a negative regulator of p53 by targeting p53 for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. mdm2 is a p53-responsive gene that acts to keep p53 in check through a feedback loop. However, under hypoxic conditions, p53 does not seem to transactivate mdm2, and the decrease in mdm2 protein in hypoxic cells is due to degradation of the protein. It has been reported that p53 protein that accumulates under hypoxic conditions is transcriptionally impaired and is unable to induce p21, Bax, or mdm2. This loss of transactivation potential has been attributed in part to the lack of association between p53 and the co-activator p300 in hypoxic extracts. Instead, p53 that accumulates under hypoxic conditions associates with the co-repressor molecule mSin3a, suggesting that can act as a trans-repressor (12Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W. Murphy M. Derr J. Taya Y. Lowe S.W. Kastan M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1297-1310Google Scholar). Both p300 and mSin3a have been shown to bind to the amino terminus of p53 (13Zilfou J.T. Hoffman W.H. Sank M. George D.L. Murphy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3974-3985Google Scholar). The amino terminus of p53 is also the site of mdm2 binding and specific stress-induced phosphorylations. We have shown previously that p53 is phosphorylated by ATR in response to hypoxia at residue serine 15 (1). Those studies also indicated that without this phosphorylation event, p53 accumulation in response to hypoxia was diminished. Several explanations exist for this finding, including the potential masking of a nuclear export signal by this phosphorylation and the subsequent accumulation of p53 in the nuclear compartment (14Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Google Scholar). In contrast to ATR, we found that ATM had no role to play in the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 in response to hypoxia because of a lack of DNA damage under hypoxic conditions. The link between the ATM kinase and phosphorylation of p53 in response to DNA damage-inducing stresses is well established and may well be responsible for suppressing tumor expansion (15Saito S.

Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Google Scholar). Histone H2AX has recently been identified as having a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase motif (SQ) at serine 139 and is a target for both ATM and ATR (17Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Google Scholar, 18Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Google Scholar). Histone H2AX is phosphorylated (γH2AX) in response to genotoxic agents, UV, hydroxyurea-mediated replication arrest, and at physiological sites of recombination during class switching (19Petersen S. Casellas R. Reina-San-Martin B. Chen H.T. Difilippantonio M.J. Wilson P.C. Hanitsch L. Celeste A. Muramatsu M. Pilch D.R. Redon C. Ried T. Bonner W.M. Honjo T. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Nature. 2001; 414: 660-665Google Scholar). During the initiation of DNA fragmentation that occurs during apoptosis, H2AX is also phosphorylated. This phosphorylation occurs with the appearance of high molecular weight DNA fragments but before the externalization of phosphatidylserine or the appearance of internucleosomal DNA fragments (20Talasz H. Helliger W. Sarg B. Debbage P.L. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 27-39Google Scholar, 21Rogakou E.P. Nieves-Neira W. Boon C. Pommier Y. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9390-9395Google Scholar). Recent studies have provided some insight into the function of H2AX. Homozygous null H2AX knockout mice are born with the expected frequency but are radiation-sensitive, growth-retarded, immune-deficient, and infertile (22Bassing C.H. Chua K.F. Sekiguchi J. Suh H. Whitlow S.R. Fleming J.C. Monroe B.C. Ciccone D.N. Yan C. Vlasakova K. Livingston D.M. Ferguson D.O. Scully R. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8173-8178Google Scholar, 23Celeste A.

Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Google Scholar). Elegant foci studies have shown that H2AX null cells had impaired recruitment of Nbs 1, 53bp1, and Brca1 to the sites of DNA damage. However, the formation of Rad51 foci in response to DNA damage was only slightly affected, if at all, in the absence of H2AX (22Bassing C.H. Chua K.F. Sekiguchi J. Suh H. Whitlow S.R. Fleming J.C. Monroe B.C. Ciccone D.N. Yan C. Vlasakova K. Livingston D.M. Ferguson D.O. Scully R. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8173-8178Google Scholar, 23Celeste A. Petersen S.

Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Google Scholar). These findings indicate that histone H2AX is needed for genome stability and efficient DNA repair and in particular the assembly of specific DNA repair proteins to DNA damage-induced nuclear foci. We have used γH2AX as a marker of both ATR and ATM activity that can be readily assayed. In this report we have further investigated the phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 by ATR in response to hypoxia, and we have shown that like p53, histone H2AX is also phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner in response to hypoxia. Most importantly, co-localization of p53 serine 15 and γH2AX within hypoxic regions of tumors indicates that oxygen concentrations within tumors are low enough to activate ATR. These data indicate that ATR and ATR-mediated signaling have a physiologically significant role to play in tumor development. We have also demonstrated that in contrast to hypoxia, reoxygenation induces a significant amount of DNA damage that can be detected by comet assays. This damage leads to ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 and other ATM targets. Because of the poorly developed vasculature of tumors, the tumor microenvironment represents a dynamic situation where tumor cells are exposed to both hypoxia and reoxygenation (24Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416Google Scholar). These studies suggest that ATR is the principal kinase for the phosphorylation of p53 in response to hypoxia and that ATM is activated by DNA damage during reoxygenation. Thus, ATR and ATM are activated by different stimuli in the tumor microenvironment. The RKO and H1299 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum. GM1526 and GM0536 were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 157 fetal bovine serum. Both GM1526 (ATM+/+, p53+/+) and GM536 (ATM−/− isolated from an ataxia-telangiectasia patient) are Epstein-Barr virus immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines. The parental HCT116 cell line and the ATR−/flox derivative were maintained in McCoy's medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum. Prior to infection with adenovirus-cre, 5 × 105 cells were plated were plated on a 10-cm dish. The cells were then infected for 48 h with fresh medium, and virus was added after 24 h. The medium was replaced before hypoxia treatment (25Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar). The cells were plated in glass dishes and treatment carried out in a hypoxia chamber (<0.27 O2) (Sheldon Corp., Cornelius, OR). Unless otherwise noted, the cells were harvested in the hypoxia chamber using PBS, lysis buffer, and trypsin where needed that had been equilibrated with the chamber.N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) was used at a final concentration of 30 mm for the duration of the hypoxia treatment. For immunoblotting the cells were lysed in 9m urea, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15m ॆ-mercaptoethanol and sonicated briefly. 50 ॖg of protein were electrophoresed on 107 polyacrylamide Tris-Tricine gels. Primary antibodies used were p53 DO-1, anti-phospho-H2AX (serine 139; Upstate Biotechnology number 07-164), anti-phospho-p53 (serine 15; Cell Signaling Technology number 9284), GAPDH (TRK5G4–6C5; Research Diagnostics), Hif1α (H72320; Transduction Laboratories), and protein G-purified α-ATR (26Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Google Scholar). The cells were grown and treated on 8-well chamber slides. After treatment the cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 20 min, then rehydrated in PBS, and blocked in 207 heat-inactivated normal goat serum, 0.17 bovine serum albumin, 0.17 sodium azide in PBS for 30 min. The cells were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C in a humidified box with anti-phospho-H2AX (serine 139) at a final concentration of 1 ॖg/ml in blocking solution. The samples were washed with PBS, 0.27 Tween 20 and then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. After washing, the samples were counter-stained with Hoescht (10 ॖg/ml) and mounted with coverslips and an aqueous anti-fade mounting reagent (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Snap frozen tumors were sectioned (14 ॖm), fixed, and stained for EF5 as previously described (27Koch C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 3-31Google Scholar). Comet assays were carried out as previously described (28Dorie M.J. Kovacs M.S. Gabalski E.C. Adam M. Le Q.T. Bloch D.A. Pinto H.A. Terris D.J. Brown J.M. Neoplasia. 1999; 1: 461-467Google Scholar, 29Siim B.G. Atwell G.J. Anderson R.F. Wardman P. Pullen S.M. Wilson W.R. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 1381-1390Google Scholar). In brief, 1–3 × 104RKO cells were prepared as a single cell suspension in magnesium/calcium-free PBS. Three volumes of a 17 low melt agarose, 27 Me2SO solution were added to the cells followed by mixing. The mixture was placed onto a microscope slide and allowed to set on a cold surface. When completely set the slide was immersed in lysis buffer for 1 h (0.03 m NaOH, 1 mNaCl, 0.17 N-lauroylsarcosine) at room temperature. The propidium iodide-stained cells (comets) were visualized using a Nikon Optiphot microscope attached to an Ikegami 4612 CCD camera and fluorescence image analysis system. Using specially designed software, the tail moment of each cells was calculated as the product of the percentage of DNA in the tail multiplied by the length of the comet tail. 200 comets were scored for each treatment. Previous work has indicated that H2AX is a substrate for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family (18Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Google Scholar). To investigate the phosphorylation of H2AX by hypoxia, RKO cells were grown at both 0.02 and 27 oxygen and harvested at different times over a 24-h period (Fig. 1A). We examined the changes in HIF-1α and p53 protein levels and p53 serine 15 and γH2AX. HIF-1α accumulated at both 0.02 and 27 oxygen. In contrast p53 only accumulated at 0.027 oxygen. Histone H2AX was clearly phosphorylated in response to extreme hypoxia but remained unaffected at 27 oxygen. These finding suggest that like p53 histone H2AX might be phosphorylated by a stress-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. To investigate the kinase responsible for this phosphorylation, we made use of both ATM and DNA-PKcs matched cell lines and a conditional ATR knockout cell line (25Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Google Scholar, 30Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402Google Scholar). Using isogenic ATM-deficient and reconstituted cell lines (GM1526 and GM0536), we found that both p53 serine 15 and H2AX are phosphorylated in response to hypoxia in an ATM-independent manner (Fig. 1B). We also found this to be true in spontaneously transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts from ATM−/− animals. Thus, a deficiency in ATM had little affect on H2AX phosphorylation. Similarly, cells that lack DNA-PKcs exhibited similar levels of H2AX phosphorylation as parental wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that hypoxia does not activate the DNA damage response kinases ATM or DNA-PKcs. Therefore, we hypothesized that ATR was responsible for histone H2AX and p53 phosphorylation in response to hypoxia. HCT116 ATR−/flox cells were treated with adenovirus-cre to knock out the remaining ATR allele from this cell line; the cells were then exposed to hypoxia and harvested at varying times for protein analysis (Fig. 1D). The level of ATR in the HCT116 ATR−/flox was significantly reduced when compared with the parental HCT116 cell line. The level of ATR protein was reduced further by infection with adenovirus-cre. Treatment with adenovirus-cre reduced hypoxia-dependent induction of both p53 serine 15 and γH2AX, indicating that the ATR kinase was activated under hypoxic conditions. Although the levels of ATR in the parental cell line and the ATR-heterozygous version were significantly different, both p53 serine 15 and H2AX were phosphorylated to the same extent in response to hypoxia. This implies that the level of ATR in the heterozygote is sufficient to phosphorylate its targets and that it is only when ATR levels are reduced below this that differences in activity can be detected. Interestingly a more significant decrease in p53 serine 15 was observed when ATR was reduced compared with the reduction seen in γH2AX levels. Fig. 1D shows a decrease in p53 serine 15 of 507, whereas the decrease in γH2AX signal is reduced by 307. Similar results were also seen when the ATR dominant negative was transfected into the RKO cell line and exposed to hypoxia (data not shown). Using this approach we would not expect to reduce the phosphorylation of either H2AX or p53 by 1007 because there is some residual ATR protein and hence ATR activity. However, the consistent discrepancy we see between γH2AX and serine 15 of p53 leads us to conclude that phosphorylation of these targets by ATR is not equivalent. A possible explanation for this finding is the different cellular localizations of p53 and H2AX; γH2AX has been shown to co-localize with BRCA1, PCNA, and 53BP1 in nuclear foci and therefore could be phosphorylated first by the remaining ATR in the adenovirus-cre cells (18Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47759-47762Google Scholar). It is also possible that other kinases, for example ATM, take over the role of ATR in its absence and that these may act on H2AX preferentially or with faster kinetics. Histone H2AX has been shown to form foci in response to both damage- and hydroxyurea-mediated replication arrest (17Burma S. Chen B.P. Murphy M. Kurimasa A. Chen D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Google Scholar), although the exact nature of these foci is as yet unclear. Fig.2 shows that γH2AX is also present in foci in hypoxia-treated RKO cells. The lack of detectable DNA damage associated with hypoxia indicates that these foci are not solely formed at sites of damage (1Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1834-1843Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that ATR is activated by replication arrest under hypoxic conditions. As would be expected for an ATR-mediated event, γH2AX foci were not detected in all cells. γH2AX foci were seen in ∼287 of cells. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions when cells were treated with the DNA damaging agent adriamycin, foci were seen in all cells. To determine whether thesein vitro findings with γH2AX or p53 serine 15 occurred in hypoxic tumor regions, we grew tumors in mice from the H1299 cell line expressing tetracycline-inducible p53, which we have previously described (12Koumenis C. Alarcon R. Hammond E. Sutphin P. Hoffman W. Murphy M. Derr J. Taya Y. Lowe S.W. Kastan M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1297-1310Google Scholar). Approximately 107 cells were implanted into the flanks of nude mice and were allowed to grow until they reached a diameter of 1 cm. Doxycycline and sucrose were added to the drinking water of half the mice, whereas the remaining half received sucrose alone before being sacrificed 24 h later. Prior to sacrifice, the mice were injected with EF5 to allow the visualization of hypoxic tumor regions (27Koch C.J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 352: 3-31Google Scholar, 31Evans S.M. Hahn S.M. Magarelli D.P. Koch C.J. Am. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 24: 467-472Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows tumor sections stained for total p53 in mice that had been fed doxycycline (lower panel) or sucrose alone (upper panel). There was a clear induction of p53 after the addition of doxycycline. This was also verified by northern blotting and persisted while doxycycline was given to the mice (up to 6 days; data not shown). Generating p53-positive tumors this way results in higher levels of p53 than would normally be seen, which ease detection in vivo. Fig. 3C shows the staining of serial sections for γH2AX, p53 Ser15, and EF5. We chose to use serial sections for these studies because the EF5 stain can bleed through to the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. The overlays of both γH2AX and p53 ser15 with EF5 are shown. Despite the use of serial sections, there was a clear overlap between staining for EF5 and γH2AX as well as EF5 and p53 serine 15. Perhaps more striking is the overlap between p53 serine 15 and γH2AX. It should be noted that not all of the cells within the EF5-positive region stained for p53 serine 15 or γH2AX, consistent with the S phase-dependent nature of ATR activation. It was not possible to visualize individual foci within stained cells. However, both p53 serine 15 and γH2AX did appear to be nuclear in localization. These data provide direct evidence that oxygen levels within tumors can reach levels low enough to induce a replication arrest and hence ATR, supporting an important role for ATR in tumor development. Hypoxia is not the only physiological stress present within a tumor. Tumor cells are also exposed to low pH, increased pressure, lack of glucose or serum, and osmotic shock (32Xu L. Glassford A.J. Giaccia A.J. Giffard R.G. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 875-879Google Scholar, 33Dmitrieva N.I. Bulavin D.V. Fornace Jr., A.J. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 184-189Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that these factors have a co-operative role in inducing the phosphorylation of ATR targets like p53 serine 15 or histone H2AX. To investigate this possibility, we grew RKO cells in conditions designed to mimic those present in tumors. The Western blots shown in Fig.4 demonstrate that neither p53 serine 15 nor H2AX were substantially phosphorylated in response to any of the stresses tested unless significant apoptosis was also induced. As previously mentioned, H2AX has been shown to be phosphorylated during the early phases of apoptosis (21Rogakou E.P. Nieves-Neira W. Boon C. Pommier Y. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9390-9395Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with sodium chloride, to mimic osmotic shock, induced one of the highest levels of apoptosis and yet very little p53 serine 15 or H2AX phosphorylation. We have previously demonstrated that hypoxia does not induce any detectable DNA damage using the alkaline comet assay (1Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1834-1843Google Scholar). We hypothesized, however, that reoxygenation would induce significant amounts of damage. This is physiologically relevant because hypoxia within tumors is often transient, resulting from transient blockage of poorly developed vasculature or increased interstitial pressure (34McDonald D.M. Baluk P. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5381-5385Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that tumor cells are exposed to continuous cycles of hypoxia and reoxygenation. To assess the amount of damage associated with reoxygenation, RKO cells were treated with hypoxia for 16 h and then harvested after different times after reoxygenation. The relative amounts of DNA damage were then assessed by comet assay. As a reference point, the cells were also exposed to 8 Gy of ionizing radiation (Fig.5). When cells were harvested entirely in normoxic conditions and hence fully reoxygenated, a significant amount of DNA damage occurred. Reoxygenation induced DNA damage approximately equivalent to treating cells with 4–5 Gy of ionizing radiation. We proposed that this level of damage would subsequently lead to increased or sustained phosphorylation of proteins that contain ATM recognition sites. To investigate this, we again made use of the GM1526 (ATM−/−) and GM0536 (ATM+/+) cell lines. The cells were exposed to hypoxia for 16 h before being harvested after various periods of reoxygenation (Fig. 6A). The p53 protein was clearly phosphorylated at serine 15 in response to hypoxia in ATM wild-type and ATM-deficient cell lines. However, as we predicted, the levels of phosphorylation were sustained in the ATM+/+ cell line, whereas they begin to decrease after 10 min of reoxygenation in the ATM nulls. This suggests that in response to the DNA damage that occurs upon reoxygenation, ATM becomes activated and is responsible for maintaining phosphorylation of targets such as p53 serine 15. Reoxygenation leads to the rapid production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) mostly in the form of superoxide molecules. By pretreating cells exposed to hypoxia with a chemical scavenger for ROS, we hypothesized that cells would be protected from the DNA-damaging effects of these molecules, and consequently reoxygenation-induced phosphorylation of p53 serine 15 would be inhibited. RKO cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence or absence of NAC and then reoxygenated (Fig. 6B). As was seen in the ATM wild-type cells (GM0536), the levels of p53 serine 15 in RKOs remained high and constant during the 35-min period after removal from hypoxia. However NAC significantly reduced the level of p53 serine 15 during reoxygenation. In the presence of NAC, the hypoxia-induced p53 serine 15 appears identical to that seen in the absence of NAC, indicating that the production of ROS during hypoxia treatment either is minimal or has no role in the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15.Figure 6p53 is phosphorylated at residue serine 15 in response to reoxygenation in an ATM-dependent manner. A, GM0536 (ATM+/+) and GM1526 (ATM−/−) cells were treated with hypoxia for 16 h. The cells were then returned to normoxia and harvested after the time periods shown. The levels of p53 serine 15 and GAPDH are shown. The cells not reoxygenated are also shown (time 0). B, RKO cells were exposed to hypoxia for 16 h before reoxygenation in the absence or presence of NAC. Upon reoxygenation the levels of p53 serine 15 remained high in those cells not treated with NAC but diminished in the presence of NAC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Many previous reports have demonstrated that γH2AX is a rapidly induced marker of DNA damage; in some cases phosphorylation has been reported within 10 min of genotoxic insult (35Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of histone H2AX occurs with much slower kinetics in response to hypoxia treatment. We have shown that this phosphorylation is ATR-dependent. Our data suggest that ATR becomes active, perhaps mediated by a change in cellular localization, in response to extreme levels of hypoxia, which induce replication arrest (1Hammond E.M. Denko N.C. Dorie M.J. Abraham R.T. Giaccia A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1834-1843Google Scholar). The induction of this replication arrest is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen present in the microenvironment. In accordance with this observation, plating cells in glass dishes, which retain less oxygen, can increase the kinetics of H2AX and p53 phosphorylation. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for a role of ATR in tumors. We have demonstrated that ATR does not phosphorylate target molecules like p53 and H2AX until oxygen levels are low enough to induce a complete stop in DNA synthesis, i.e. replication arrest. Significantly, the finding that both p53 and H2AX are phosphorylated in vivo in the hypoxic regions of tumors indicates that these extreme levels of hypoxia do indeed occur in tumors. We have eliminated many other tumor-physiologically relevant stresses as having a co-operative role in the induction of these phosphorylation events. We have previously showed that hypoxia did not induce any DNA damage detectable by the comet assay. Here, in contrast, we found that cells taken from severe hypoxia to normoxia had a significant amount of comet-detectable damage. What was particularly striking about these findings was the rapid kinetics of DNA damage induction in response to reoxygenation. We hypothesized that this damage might lead to subsequent ATM activation and also may have been mediated by the formation of ROS. We have presented evidence that both of these hypotheses are indeed valid. In the absence of ATM, the level of p53 phosphorylated at serine 15 slowly decreased, whereas it was maintained in the presence of ATM for at least 60 min. The addition of the ROS scavenger NAC inhibited the reoxygenation-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 but had no effect on the hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. We propose that both ATR and ATM have roles to play in tumor progression but that these roles may be distinct. Fig.7 shows our proposed model. Initially ATR responds to replication arrest induced at severe levels of hypoxia followed by an ATM response to the DNA damage induced when these areas become reoxygenated. Our data suggest that the activation of one phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase over another is based on the presence or absence of DNA damage. We have been unable to detect DNA damage in cells that have undergone a replication arrest in response to hypoxia and therefore conclude that damage is not required for the relocalization of ATR to nuclear foci. We do not exclude the possibility that damage nondetectable by Comet assay does occur but would argue that if present it must be at a very low level and certainly not comparable with the significant damage seen upon reoxygenation. As previously mentioned, ATM has a much more defined role in the response to DNA damage, and it is perhaps therefore not surprising that it has a role to play in the reoxygenation response. Further insight will come from the identification of ATM- or ATR-specific targets. Neither Chk 2 or residue 20 of p53 are phosphorylated in response to extreme hypoxia, 2E. M. Hammond and A. J. Giaccia, unpublished results. but both may be induced in response to reoxygenation in an ATM-dependent manner. The identification of these damage-specific targets will allow us to further elucidate the ATM damage response and the ATR replication response. Hypoxia may well be the ideal if not only model to study this further because it is unique in the induction of replication arrest without detectable concomitant damage. We are very grateful to Drs. Baz Smith and Dawn Zinyk for technical assistance. We also thank Drs. David Cortez and Stephen Elledge for the gift of the HCT116 ATR−/flox cell line and the Adeno-cre, and Dr. David Chen for the mouse embryonic fibroblast DNA-PKcs−/− and mouse embryonic fibroblast ATM−/− cell lines."

Chem. 1998; 273: 7507-7511Google Scholar). In this study, the arginine-rich motif of the HIV-11 TAT protein should be used to overcome these obstacles. The 101-amino acid HIV-1 TAT protein regulates transcriptional activation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat promoter element by binding to a short nascent stem-bulge-loop leader RNA, trans-activation response (TAR), recruiting a positive transcription elongation complex (P-TEFb) (3Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Google Scholar). Binding of HIV-1 TAT protein to the TAR RNA is substantially mediated through the arginine-rich motif (amino acids 47–57), which represents a basic stretch of amino acids located to domain 4 of the HIV-1 TAT protein (3Jeang K.T. Xiao H. Rich E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28837-28840Google Scholar). Besides its importance for binding to the TAR RNA, the arginine-rich motif of the HIV-1 TAT protein (TAT peptide) has been shown to function as a protein transduction domain, penetrating cell membranes in a manner different from classic endocytosis (4Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Google Scholar, 5Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Google Scholar, 6Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Google Scholar). This uptake mechanism was also observed for heterologous proteins when they were chemically coupled (7Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 664-668Google Scholar) or genetically fused (8Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Google Scholar) to the TAT peptide. In addition, the conjugation of the TAT peptide to various structures of nanometric size, such as superparamagnetic nanoparticles (9Lewin M. Carlesso N. Tung C.H. Tang X.W. Cory D. Scadden D.T. Weissleder R. Nat Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 410-414Google Scholar), liposomes (10Torchilin V.P. Rammohan R. Weissig V. Levchenko T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8786-8791Google Scholar), and λ phage (11Eguchi A. Akuta T. Okuyama H. Senda T. Yokoi H. Inokuchi H. Fujita S. Hayakawa T. Takeda K. Hasegawa M. Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26204-26210Google Scholar), led to their uptake into cells in a manner apparently different from endocytosis. Besides this unique feature of the TAT-peptide, the TAT peptide represents a nuclear localization sequence (12Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Google Scholar). Upon binding of the TAT peptide itself or its conjugates to the nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein importin β, nuclear import through the nuclear pore has been observed (4Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O.

The objective of the present study was to examine whether the unique features of the TAT peptide (protein transduction domain and nuclear localization sequence) and its polycationic nature are suitable to enhance nonviral gene delivery. Chemical properties of cationic polymers, such as the degree of polymerization, the type of cationic groups present in the polymer, or the amino acid composition of cationic oligopeptides influence the biophysical properties of their polyelectrolyte complexes with plasmid DNA. DNA binding affinity, surface charge, and particle size have pronounced effects on their efficacy in gene delivery and on biodistribution in vivo(13Plank C. Tang M.X. Wolfe A.R. Szoka Jr., F.C. Hum Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 319-332Google Scholar, 14Wolfert M.A. Dash P.R. Nazarova O. Oupicky D. Seymour L.W. Smart S. Strohalm J. Ulbrich K.

Since compaction of DNA into stable microparticulate structures by oligopeptides suitable for gene transfer requires a minimum chain length of 6–10 cationic amino acids (13Plank C. Tang M.X. Wolfe A.R. Szoka Jr., F.C. Hum Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 319-332Google Scholar), we synthesized the TAT peptide as oligomers. The dimer, trimer, and tetramer of identical repeats with intervening glycine residues comprise 16, 24, and 32 positive charges, respectively. We attempted to find a correlation between the degree of oligomerization of the TAT peptide, the resulting biophysical characteristics of peptide-DNA complexes, and their gene delivery efficiency in context with the unique functions of the TAT peptide. The following peptides were synthesized. Peptide C(YGRKKRRQRRRG)2–4 (TAT2–4) contained the arginine-rich motif of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 TAT protein. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 431 A automatic synthesizer according to a standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol. Peptide C(YGRKERRQERRG)2 (TAT2-M1) was synthesized by the Department of Medicine (Charité) (Institute of Biochemistry, Humboldt-University, Berlin). The free sulfhydryl groups were modified by dithiodipyridine reaction (13Plank C. Tang M.X. Wolfe A.R. Szoka Jr., F.C. Hum Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 319-332Google Scholar). pCMV-Luc containing firefly luciferase cDNA driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter was generously provided by Dr. E. Wagner (Department of Pharmacy, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich) and amplified as described in Ref. 16Rudolph C. Lausier J. Naundorf S. Muller R.H. Rosenecker J. J Gene Med. 2000; 2: 269-278Google Scholar. The particle sizes were determined by dynamic light scattering, and ζ potentials were measured electrophoretically (Zetasizer 3000HS; Malvern Instruments, Herrenberg, Germany). Gene vector solutions in distilled water or HBS were generated at a DNA concentration of 10 μg/ml (17Rudolph C. Muller R.H. Rosenecker J. J Gene Med. 2002; 4: 66-74Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (pCMVLuc) was labeled with TOTO-1 (dye/base pair ratio of 1:20). The TAT oligomers were serially diluted in HBS in a 96-well plate corresponding to the indicated charge ratios. 100 μl of a solution of TOTO-1-labeled DNA (0.25 μg of DNA in HBS) was pipetted to either 100 μl of TAT oligomer solution or 100 μl of HBS (100%) and thoroughly mixed. The excitation filter was set at 485 nm, and the emission filter was set at 535 nm (SPECTRAFluor Plus, Tecan, Germany). Measurements were performed in quadruples. Human bronchoepithelial cells (16HBE14o−) were provided by Dieter C. Gruenert (University of Vermont, Burlington, VT). Cells were grown in FCS (10%)-supplemented minimum essential medium (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. COS-7 cells were cultivated in FCS (10%)-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Fresh nasal respiratory epithelium was obtained from patients through surgery and immediately processed as follows. Briefly, epithelial cells were detached from connective tissue after 1-h incubation at 37 °C in the presence of dispase II (1 unit/ml phosphate-buffered saline; Roche Diagnostics) and then filtered and centrifuged (150 × g, 5 min, ambient temperature). The pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of RPMI plus 10% FCS containing antibiotics, and cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes. The next day, the medium was replaced by bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (catalog no.C21160; Promocell). Gene vector complexes for one well were formulated as follows. 1 μg of DNA and the corresponding amount of vector were diluted in HBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) to 75 μl, respectively. The DNA solution was pipetted to the vector solution and mixed vigorously by pipetting up and down. The complexes were incubated for 20 min at ambient temperature before use. Ternary gene vector complexes for one well were generated in the same manner, but DNA, TAT oligomer, and standard cationic transfection agent (PEI, average molecular mass of 25 kDa; Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany; dialyzed against water, 12–14-kDa molecular mass cut-off and adjusted to pH 7; fractured dendrimers; SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, GmbH) were diluted in HBS to 50 μl, respectively. The DNA solution was pipetted to the TAT oligomer or poly-l-arginine (pLa; Sigma catalog no. P 4663;M r 5000–15,000) solution, mixed vigorously, and incubated at ambient temperature for 10 min, and then the standard cationic vector solution was added, again incubated at ambient temperature for 10 min. Alternatively, DNA was first pipetted to the standard vector solution, and the TAT oligomer solution was then added. 150 μl of gene vector solution, corresponding to 1 μg of DNA, were pipetted onto cells (COS-7, 30,000 cells/well; 16HBE, 100,000 cells/well), which had been seeded into 24-well plates 1 day before, and then covered with 850 μl of medium in the absence of FCS. After 4 h of incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C, the medium was replaced with 10% FCS-containing medium supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5% (v/v) gentamycin (Invitrogen). When transfections were performed at 4 °C, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C before transfection and incubation with the gene vectors was performed at 4 °C. When transfections were performed in the presence of a mixture of endocytosis inhibitors, the transfection medium was supplemented with antimycin A (1 μg/ml; Sigma), sodium fluoride (10 mm; Sigma), and sodium azide (0.1% (m/v); Sigma), respectively. After 4 h, the medium was replaced with 10% FCS-containing medium supplemented with antibiotics (see above). Transfections of growth-arrested cells were performed as follows. Cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence of FCS (serum starvation) or subjected to incubation followed by a 12-h incubation period with aphidicolin (25 μm, with FCS) before transfection. Transfections were then performed either in the presence of aphidicolin (25 μm) followed by further incubation of the cells for 24 h in aphidicolin-supplemented medium or in the absence of FCS. 24 h later, cells were lysed by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer (250 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8) per well, and luciferase activity was measured (Promega kit, Lumat LB 9507; Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany). Protein content was determined by a standard Bio-Rad protein assay (Bradford method). A three-dimensional fluorescence in situhybridization was done following the protocol of Solovei and Cremer (18.Solovei, I., and Cremer, M. (in press) Methods Mol. Biol.Google Scholar) with several modifications for our specific needs. A DNA probe was generated from the pEGFP plasmid (Clontech) by nick translation. A digoxigenin hapten was inserted with Dig Nick Translation Mix (Roche Diagnostics) generating a probe with a 300-bp median length. The reaction mixtures were cleaned of small fragments and nucleotides with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 1 μg of probe was precipitated with 50 μg of salmon testes DNA (Sigma). The dried pellet was reconstituted in 20 μl of formamide at 37 °C for 2 h and stored until use at −20 °C. The probe was brought to 37 °C and mixed 1:1 with “Fish Mix” (4× SSC, 40% dextran sulfate), resulting in a hybridization solution of 25 ng/μl probe in 2× SSC, 20% dextran sulfate, 50% formamide. The hybridization solution was denatured at 75 °C for 5 min and briefly kept at 37 °C prior to slide application. The slides were removed one at a time from the storage solution, 50 μl of hybridization solution was placed on each slide, a coverslip was applied, and finally rubber cement was used as a sealant. The sealed slides were heated to 75 °C for 3 min to denature the cellular DNA, also further denaturing the probe DNA. The slides were placed in a moist chamber within a 37 °C oven and were hybridized for 2–3 days. Light optical sections were generated for each nucleus with a three-channel confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS 4D; Leica Inc., Deerfield, IL) equipped with a Plan Apo 63×/1.32 oil immersion lens. Using the 488 and 567 lines of an argon/krypton laser for visualization of the Sytox and rhodamine, signals respectively, stacks of 256 × 256 equidistant 8-bit grayscale images were generated at an axial distance of 250 nm, pixel size of 1 nm. Each series consisted of ∼20–25 images. Lines were averaged eight times. The different fluorochromes were imaged sequentially in identical nuclear planes. Laser power and voltage for the rhodamine channel were maintained at the same level for all conditions, whereas the voltage of the Sytox channel was adjusted for variations in nuclear counterstain. Cells were randomly selected when a signal appeared to be in the cell, and the midnuclear sections were used to detect the distribution of plasmid DNA. Ternary gene vector complexes used for in vivoexperiments were generated as described above, but the TAT oligomer and DNA solution were diluted in double-distilled water (Fresenius AG, Bad Homburg, Germany), respectively. 60 μl of gene vector solution containing 20 μg of DNA were applied per mouse. The gene vector application was performed as described in Ref. 16Rudolph C. Lausier J. Naundorf S. Muller R.H. Rosenecker J. J Gene Med. 2000; 2: 269-278Google Scholar. In brief, mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with pentobarbital and directly intubated with a single 60-μl bolus of the indicated gene vector using a 22-gauge intravascular cannula sleeve, needle removed (25 mm, 0.9-mm outer diameter, 0.6-mm inner diameter; Baxter, Germany). At 24 h post-transfection, mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with pentobarbital, and mice peritoneum were opened by midline incision. In order to wash blood from the lungs and to avoid interference with the subsequent luciferase assay, a posterior vena cava exit was cut, and 1 ml of an isotonic sodium chloride solution was slowly perfused into the mice right cardiac ventricle. The lungs were dissected from animals, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. At assay time, the tissue was thawed on ice, and 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm magnesium sulfate, 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100 (m/V), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units/ml buffer aprotinin) was added to each sample and homogenized for 20 s using a Polytron Pt 2100 homogenizer (level 5 corresponding to 26,000 rpm; Kinematica, Litau/Luzern, Switzerland). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and 40 μl of the supernatant were measured for luciferase activity in a Lumat LB 9507 instrument (Berthold) injecting 100 μl of luciferase reagent (Promega) to each sample, and the light emitted over 10 s was measured. The background was subtracted from the reported values. 1 × 106 relative luciferase units/10 s correspond to 1.25 ng of luciferase. All animal procedures were approved and controlled by the local ethics committee and carried out according to the guidelines of the German law of protection of animal life. Results are reported as means ± S.D. The statistical analysis between different groups has been determined with a nonpairedt test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the program StatView 5.0. (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The condensation of DNA into particulate structures is a prerequisite for gene delivery. For this reason, we first examined the capability of the TAT oligomers to condense DNA and to form particulate complexes. Laser light scattering showed that all of the TAT oligomer gene vectors had a diameter of ∼70 nm in water, which increased to 700 nm in HBS at charge ratios of ±1 and 5, respectively (Table I). pLa (control) gene vectors showed a similar diameter. TAT oligomer and pLa gene vectors had a positive ζ potential of approximately +40 mV in water and negative ζ potential of approximately −20 mV at ±1 in HBS, which changed into a positive ζ potential of 20 mV at ± 5 and slightly increased with the degree of oligomerization (Table I). The extent of complexation was independent of the degree of polymerization as examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and DNase I protection assay (see Supplementary Material). The only difference among TAT oligomer gene vectors depending on the oligomer size could be observed when complexes were analyzed by a fluorescence quenching assay (Fig.1). Fluorescence quenching strongly increased at low charge ratios, reaching a plateau at approximately ±2. Higher charge ratios only slightly increased further DNA condensation. Fluorescence quenching induced by pLa was shifted to a higher charge ratio compared with the TAT peptides. Fluorescence quenching at a given charge ratio increased with the degree of oligomerization, indicating that the DNA was more tightly packed in the complex when the size of the TAT oligomer increased.Table IParticle size (nm) and ζ potential (mV) in water and HBS(+/−)TAT2TAT3TAT4pLa1Water91 ± 590 ± 388 ± 884 ± 3(43.9 ± 8.2)(39.3 ± 11.9)(39.2 ± 6.4)(−1.5 ± 5.1)HBS723 ± 174737 ± 159718 ± 159156 ± 19(−22.8 ± 2.1)(−15.7 ± 2.6)(−19.5 ± 3.4)(−36.2 ± 3.4)5Water76 ± 769 ± 368 ± 369 ± 5(41.6 ± 12.3)(42.7 ± 8.3)(35.8 ± 8.6)(41.1 ± 13.6)HBS709 ± 172696 ± 189708 ± 187755 ± 178(15.8 ± 2.7)(21.9 ± 2.9)(27.2 ± 1.0)(29.7 ± 0.5)Gene vector complexes were prepared in double-distilled water or HBS at the indicated charge ratios, and the particle size (nm) or ζ potential (mV) was measured. Open table in a new tab Gene vector complexes were prepared in double-distilled water or HBS at the indicated charge ratios, and the particle size (nm) or ζ potential (mV) was measured. Plasmid DNA was complexed with each of the TAT oligomers at different charge ratios and transfection efficiency was examined in vitro. In addition, pLa gene vectors were prepared under the same conditions as control to assess the possibility of a sequence-dependent process (Fig. 2 A). For each charge ratio tested, a significant improvement of transfection by TAT2 and TAT3 gene vectors compared with pLa gene vectors was observed. No statistical difference between TAT4 and pLa gene vectors was observed. The transfection rates mediated by each of the oligomers did not correlate with the degree of oligomerization of the TAT peptide. Intermediate length of the TAT3-oligomer mediated the highest level of transgene expression. To further characterize sequence dependence, gene transfer efficiency mediated by the nuclear transport-deficient TAT2-M1 peptide (12Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Google Scholar) was examined. Gene transfer efficiency mediated by the TAT2-M1 peptide (± charge = 10) was 6-fold lower as compared with the TAT2 peptide (± charge = 10, Fig. 2 C, p < 0.01). To examine endocytosis as an uptake mechanism, transfections were performed in the presence of chloroquin (19Cotten M. Langle-Rouault F. Kirlappos H. Wagner E. Mechtler K. Zenke M. Beug H. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4033-4037Google Scholar), at 4 °C (6Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Google Scholar, 10Torchilin V.P.

For each of the TAT oligomer gene vectors, transfection efficiencies in the presence of chloroquine strongly increased (Fig. 2 B; compare with Fig. 2 A). Gene transfer mediated by TAT2and TAT3 gene vectors was significantly higher as compared with pLa gene vectors. This was not the case for TAT4vectors. Overall transfection efficiency increased in the following order: TAT2 > TAT3 > TAT4. In the presence of chloroquine, the transfection efficiency of TAT2 gene vectors was enhanced 40-fold, whereas the transfection efficiency of pLa gene vectors was only enhanced 3-fold. Transfections performed at 4 °C led to a 20–90-fold decrease of transgene expression (Fig. 2 D). Transfection rates in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitors decreased even more (Fig.2 E). Transgene expression mediated by TAT3-DNA complexes in the presence of chloroquine was 3- and 4-fold higher as compared with PEI and SuperFect polyplexes and at the same level as LipofectAMINE lipoplexes (Fig. 2 F). These data suggest that the cellular uptake mechanism of the TAT oligomer gene vector complexes was predominated by the endosomal pathway and could not be precisely differentiated from endocytosis. However, due to the much stronger increase of gene transfer of the TAT oligomer complexes in the presence of chloroquin, as compared with pLa complexes, one could suggest that gene transfer of the TAT oligomers, in particular TAT2, was peptide sequence-dependent. This is supported by the higher gene transfer efficiency of the TAT2 gene vectors as compared with the TAT2-M1 gene vectors (Fig.2 C). To further investigate the localization of plasmid DNA electrostatically bound to each of the TAT oligomers within the cell, COS-7 cells were transfected with TAT oligomer polyplexes or with pLa polyplexes, and plasmid DNA distribution was visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Transfections were stopped after 4 h, and slides were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Fig.3 shows a single light optical section. Numerous rounded red spots of DNA were seen in the cytoplasm, and a few were located in the cell nucleus and at the nuclear membrane for TAT2 gene vectors. The same distribution pattern could be observed for TAT3 gene vectors, but the total number of intracellular DNA spots seemed to be reduced. There were no DNA spots found in the nucleus of cells transfected with TAT4 gene vectors. In this case, DNA was rather found as rounded and irregular structures restricted to only the outer side of the nuclear membrane. A similar distribution pattern was observed for pLa gene vectors. The previous experiments suggest that the TAT oligomers could facilitate the transport of DNA into the nucleus. Next we examined whether the TAT oligomers were able to enhance gene transfer efficiency of poly- or lipoplexes that lack efficient nuclear plasmid transport (2Pollard H. Remy J.S. Loussouarn G. Demolombe S. Behr J.P. Escande D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7507-7511Google Scholar, 23Brunner S. Sauer T. Carotta S. Cotten M. Saltik M. Wagner E. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 401-407Google Scholar, 24Zabner J. Fasbender A.J. Moninger T. Poellinger K.A. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18997-19007Google Scholar). Ternary gene vector complexes consisting of TAT oligomer, standard cationic transfection agent, and DNA were formulated in two different manners. Either TAT oligomer was added to preformed gene vectors consisting of DNA and standard cationic transfection agent, or complexes were generated vice versa through the addition of standard cationic transfection agent to preformed TAT oligomer gene vector complexes. When one charge equivalent of each of the TAT oligomers or pLa was added to preformed standard cationic gene vector complexes, the level of transgene expression remained approximately at the same level as of the standard cationic gene vectors (Fig.4). In contrast, when the ternary gene vector complexes were generated vice versa (i.e.the DNA was first complexed with one charge equivalent of each of the TAT oligomers, and then the standard transfection agents were added), a strong increase of transgene expression depending on the degree of oligomerization and the type of standard transfection agent was observed (Fig. 4). The presence of TAT2, TAT3, and TAT4 enhanced transgene expression of PEI 130-, 80-, and 40-fold, respectively. pLa did not enhance PEI-mediated gene transfer. An analog behavior could be observed when the TAT oligomers were combined with either fractured dendrimers or LipofectAMINE. To characterize in more detail the transfection mechanism of the ternary TATn-PEI-DNA complexes, the kinetics of transgene expression was examined on 16HBE cells (Fig. 5). At the 4-h time point, the transgene expression of transfected 16HBE cells was 220-, 170-, and 100-fold higher for the TAT2-, TAT3-, and TAT4-derived ternary gene vectors as compared with PEI polyplexes, respectively. At the 8-h time point, the enhancement in transfection efficiency increased to 390-, 240-, and 140-fold, respectively. After 24 h, the level of transfection efficiency mediated by the ternary TAT2–4 gene vectors was 104-, 56-, and 45-fold higher as compared with PEI polyplexes, respectively. The transfection efficiency of the TAT2-PEI-DNA complex at as early as the 4-h time point was 4-fold higher as compared with the transfection efficiency mediated by PEI polyplexes after 24 h (p < 0.01). These data suggest rapid accumulation of the DNA in the cell nucleus when TAT oligomers were incorporated into the PEI polyplexes. To further assess whether the enhancement of transfection efficiency mediated by the TAT oligomers could be due to facilitated nuclear transport of the transgene, transfection experiments were performed on growth-arrested cells. Transfection experiments were performed on 16HBE cells either arrested by aphidicolin incubation (25Escriou V. Carriere M. Bussone F. Wils P. Scherman D. J Gene Med. 2001; 3: 179-187Google Scholar) or through serum starvation (26Chida K. Sueyoshi R. Kuroki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 849-852Google Scholar). Under both conditions, the transfection efficiency of the ternary gene vector complexes was significantly higher as compared with PEI polyplexes (Fig. 6). The incorporation of TAT2, TAT3, and TAT4 led to a 35-, 20-, and 12-fold higher transf"

Production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was increased in alveolar macrophages from SP-C (−/−) mice. Absence of SP-C caused a severe progressive pulmonary disorder with histologic features consistent with interstitial pneumonitis. SP-C is a 34–35-amino acid peptide expressed selectively in type II epithelial cells in the alveolus of the lung (for review see Refs. 1Weaver T.E. Conkright J.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 555-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholarand 2Johansson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A single sp-C gene is located on human chromosome 8 that is syntenic to that in the mouse located on chromosome 14. Thesp-C gene encodes a proprotein of 197 or 191 amino acids (pro-SP-C) that is palmitoylated, proteolytically processed, and routed through the rough endoplasmic reticulum and multivesicular bodies to lamellar bodies in which surfactant is stored. The SP-C peptide is secreted into the airspace where it enhances the stability and spreading of phospholipids. The SP-C peptide is highly hydrophobic and also contains two cysteine residues in an NH2-terminal domain. These cysteines are palmitoylated and located near an extended hydrophobic domain wherein 19 of 23 residues are valine, leucine, or isoleucine. This hydrophobic region forms an α-helical structure that spans a lipid bilayer (3Morrow M.R. Taneva S. Simatos G.A. Allwood L.A. Keough K.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11338-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both the α-helical domain and the cysteine-linked palmitoyl groups are tightly associated with phospholipids. SP-C disrupts phospholipid acyl chain packing and enhances recruitment of phospholipids to monolayers and multilayers at the air-liquid interface (4Horowitz A.D. Elledge B. Whitsett J.A. Baatz J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Johansson J. Szyperski T. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These features suggest a structural role for SP-C in facilitating the movement of phospholipids between multilayered films. Biological functions of purified SP-C or synthetic SP-C peptides are highly active in vitro and in vivo, enhancing surfactant properties of lipids and restoring lung function in surfactant-deficient animals (6Whitsett J.A.

These results indicate that SP-C plays an important role in the spreading and stabilization of phospholipid films in the alveolus.An unexpected role for SP-C in pulmonary homeostasis was provided by recent studies (8Nogee L.M.

Pulmonary disease in these patients was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Interstitial pneumonitis includes various pulmonary disorders including desquamating interstitial pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, and other disorders broadly termed idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (IIP) (10Katzenstein A.L. Myers J.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Individuals with these disorders usually present with progressive lung disease associated with exercise limitation, tachypnea, and shortness of breath. Because mutations in the SP-C proprotein resulted in the production of an abnormal pro-SP-C peptide that was not fully processed, it has been unclear whether the lack of SP-C per se or misfolding of pro-SP-C or SP-C was involved in the pathogenesis of IIP in these patients (5Johansson J. Szyperski T. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In general, various forms of IIP are associated with alveolar inflammation, pulmonary infiltration with monocytes-macrophages, progressive loss of alveolar structure, and pulmonary fibrosis (10Katzenstein A.L. Myers J.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IIP have been elusive despite well recognized histologic and clinical manifestations.Targeted disruption of the sp-C gene in outbred Swiss black mice resulted in mild abnormalities in lung function consistent with decreased stability of the surfactant film at low lung volumes (11Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. Na C.-L. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6366-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this outbred genetic background, sp-C gene targeted mice had only subtle alterations in lung mechanics that were exacerbated by oxygen-induced injury and an accompanying deficiency in SP-B (12Ikegami M. Weaver T.E. Conkright J.J. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Whitsett J.A. Glasser S.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, the SP-C (−/−) allele was studied in a congenic 129/Sv strain. SP-C-deficient mice developed severe, progressive pulmonary disease associated with emphysema, α-smooth muscle actin staining, monocytic infiltrates, and epithelial cell dysplasia in conducting and peripheral airways.DISCUSSIONA severe pulmonary disorder characterized by emphysema, epithelial cell dysplasia, monocytic cell infiltration, increased α-smooth muscle staining, and abnormal lipid accumulations was caused by targeted deletion of the sp-C gene in a congenic strain of SP-C (−/−)/129/Sv mice. Heterogeneous pulmonary lesions contained the following: 1) thickened alveolar walls that stained for α-smooth muscle actin; 2) extensive monocytic infiltrates and increased expression of metalloproteinases; 3) regions of severe emphysema with septal thinning and degeneration of pulmonary capillaries; 4) epithelial cell dysplasia and MUC5A/C expression in conducting airways; and 5) accumulation of intracellular lipids in various cell types. Pathologic findings in the SP-C (−/−) mice were consistent with, but not identical to, those seen in lungs from patients with various conditions termed idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (IIP). Thus, lack of SP-C or pro-SP-C can be directly linked to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease in mice.A mutation in the sp-C gene was recently associated with familial interstitial pneumonitis that was inherited as an autosomal dominant effect (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 9Thomas A.Q. Lane K. Phillips III, J. Prince M. Markin C.

In a sibship with mutation c460 + 1Gly → Ala, resulting in an exon 4 deletion of the pro-SP-C peptide, misprocessed pro-SP-C accumulated within type II epithelial cells; tissue and lung lavage material lacked the active SP-C peptide (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Similarly, a single base pair substitution (L188Q) altered subcellular localization of pro-SP-C in an extended family with IIP (9Thomas A.Q. Lane K. Phillips III, J. Prince M. Markin C. Speer M. Schwartz D.A. Gaddipati R. Marney A. Johnson J. Roberts R. Haines J. Stahlman M. Loyd J.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been unclear whether the severe pulmonary disease in these patients results from the lack of SP-C or to abnormal accumulations of misfolded mutant SP-C or pro-SP-C proteins. The present studies demonstrate that the lack of SP-C per se can recapitulate many of the pathologic findings consistent with various forms of adult and childhood interstitial pneumonitis.Although the absence of pro-SP-C and/or SP-C caused severe lung disease in the mouse, the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder remains unclear. At the light microscopic level, lung structure in the SP-C (−/−) mice was normal at E19.5 and postnatal day 1 (data not shown). Abnormalities seen in lung structure increased with advancing age, suggesting that emphysema and remodeling do not arise from abnormalities in lung morphogenesis but from ongoing injury and repair processes. The expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines that have been associated previously with emphysema and inflammation were not altered in the SP-C (−/−) mice. There was no change in neutrophil number, and there was no evidence of viral or bacterial infection in SP-C (−/−) mice. These findings suggest that the remodeling and inflammation are caused by cellular abnormalities intrinsic to the lung, and dependent upon the functions of SP-C or perhaps the result of selective degradation of extracellular matrix by MMPs elaborated by the macrophages rather than to susceptibility to pathogens. MMP-9 and MMP-2 production by alveolar macrophages and MMP-12 mRNA levels were increased and therefore may play a role in the pathogenesis of the lung disease in the SP-C (−/−) mice. Increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 expression was previously associated with emphysema in sp-Dgene targeted mice (26Wert S.E. Yoshida M. LeVine A.M. Ikegami M. Jones T. Ross G.F. Fisher J.H. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar).Whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were not increased in the lungs of the SP-C (−/−) mice, the lungs were infiltrated with atypical alveolar macrophages containing numerous lipid inclusions and Ym1 crystals (25Chang N.C. Hung S.I. Hwa K.Y. Kato I. Chen J.E. Liu C.H. Chang A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17497-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The numbers of the abnormal macrophages were increased 4–5-fold compared with control. Cellular infiltration was associated with discrete sites of alveolar thickening and fibrosis. The myofibroblast transformation and collagen deposition seen at the ultrastructural level were consistent with increased α-SMA staining seen throughout the alveolar walls of the SP-C (−/−) mice. Paradoxically, marked epithelial cell dysplasia was observed in conducting airways in the SP-C (−/−) mice, despite the fact that pro-SP-C is not expressed in these cells in wild type mice. Furthermore, high levels of expression of MUC5A/C were observed in the conducting airways at sites in which SP-C mRNA and protein are not normally expressed. MUC5A/C is normally expressed at low levels in the conducting airways of mice but is readily induced by inflammation or inflammatory cytokines, being increased by IL-4, IL-13, and allergens (for review see Ref. 27Rose M.C. Nickola T.J. Voynow J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These latter findings suggest that the lack of SP-C may influence gene expression outside the alveolus, implying that SP-C plays a role, directly or indirectly, in the conducting airways. However, it is unclear whether cellular abnormalities in the conducting airways of SP-C (−/−) mice are mediated directly by SP-C-dependent signaling events or might be related to SP-C-dependent modulation of surface forces or changes in mucociliary clearance in the absence of SP-C.The finding that severe lung disease can be caused by either the expression of a dominantly inherited mutant pro-SP-C protein or the deletion of sp-C gene suggests several potential mechanisms by which SP-C may contribute to the pathogenesis of IIP. In the IIP patients described by Nogee et al. (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and Thomas et al. (9Thomas A.Q. Lane K. Phillips III, J. Prince M. Markin C. Speer M. Schwartz D.A. Gaddipati R. Marney A. Johnson J. Roberts R. Haines J. Stahlman M. Loyd J.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 165: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), the mutant pro-SP-C protein accumulated within type II cells, potentially creating cell injury related to the misfolding or misprocessing of the precursor protein. In support of this concept, Conkright et al. (28Conkright J.J. Na C.-L. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that expression of an SP-C mutant protein caused lethal lung dysfunction in vivo. However, the active SP-C peptide was absent in the SP-C (−/−) mice and in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis caused by this dominantly inherited SP-C mutation (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of SP-C per se may be involved in the pathogenesis of IIP. Amin et al. (29Amin R.S. Wert S.E. Baughman R.P. Tomashefski J.F. Nogee L.M. Brody A.S. Hull W.M. Whitsett J.A. J. Pediatr. 2001; 139: 85-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) recently described a sibship in which three individuals were severely affected by IIP, each of whom lacked detectable expression of either pro-SP-C or SP-C in alveolar lavage, despite the failure to find mutations in the coding region of SP-C. Whether the selective lack of pro-SP-C or SP-C directly caused the disorder in these patients is unclear.Do Abnormalities in Surfactant Function Contribute to IIP?The present findings demonstrate unequivocally that the lack of SP-C per se causes inflammation and alveolar remodeling in mice. Because SP-C enhances surface properties of phospholipids in the airspace, it is possible that the lack of SP-C alters surfactant function in time leading to pneumonitis. However, lung phospholipid content was unaltered in SP-C (−/−) mice in the Swiss black strain (11Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Korfhagen T.R. Na C.-L. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Ikegami M. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6366-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and was increased 2-fold in SP-C (−/−) mice in 129/Sv background. Surfactant phospholipid composition, structure of lamellar bodies, and tubular myelin were generally preserved in both strains of SP-C (−/−) mice. Changes in lung mechanics and lung histology shown in a previous study of 8-week-old Swiss black SP-C (−/−) mice were distinct from the present study. In SP-C (−/−) Swiss black mice, there was no evidence of inflammation or emphysema. Hysteresivity, which describes the mechanical coupling between tissue resistance and elastace, was decreased, and findings were consistent with a modest abnormality of in vitro surface activities of surfactant. In contrast, the SP-C (−/−) mice in the present study showed more severe abnormalities in airway resistance, tissue damping, and hysteresivity. Taken together, the findings of altered pulmonary mechanics are consistent with similar functional changes detected in a transgenic model that develops emphysema (30Pillow J.J. Korfhagen T.R. Ikegami M. Sly P.D. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SP-B and surfactant phospholipid pool sizes were normal or increased, consistent with the observed preservation of surfactant function. The modestly increased levels of SP-A and SP-D in the SP-C (−/−) 129/Sv mice may reflect changes related to chronic lung inflammation. Thus, there is no evidence at present that surfactant deficiency accounts for the chronic lung disease in the SP-C (−/−) 129/Sv mice, but it remains possible that subtle differences in sheer forces not discernible in the present studies may contribute to the disruption of lung structure and function in the SP-C (−/−) mice. In vitro studies demonstrate that various growth factors, cytokines, and sheer stress can cause myofibroblast transformation of lung fibroblasts. Consistent with the increased α-SMA staining observed in the present study in mice, the extensive fibrosis and myofibroblast transformation is often seen in humans with IIP (10Katzenstein A.L. Myers J.L. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Whereas abnormal trichrome staining was observed in the lungs of SP-C (−/−) mice, these areas were relatively sparse and heterogeneous. Severe fibrotic lesions characteristic of human patients with IIP or sp-C gene mutations were not observed. It is presently unclear whether these differences reflect species or age-related differences or that the pathological processes are distinct. If lack of SP-C contributes to the pathogenesis of the pulmonary disease, therapy in which exogenous SP-C is administered might be considered for patients with deficiency or mutations in SP-C. On the other hand, if the disorder is caused by misrouting and abnormal accumulations of SP-C or mutant SP-C, the addition or increased expression of normal SP-C may actually contribute to the disorder.Does SP-C Deficiency Cause a Lipid Storage Disease?Surfactant lipids, lamellar bodies, and tubular myelin accumulated in the atypical macrophages, and prominent lipid droplets were observed in the abundant fibroblasts underlying type II cells in the lungs of SP-C (−/−) mice. These pathologic findings suggest the possibility that the absence of SP-C alters the catabolism of surfactant or other cellular constituents, creating a storage disorder.In vitro studies (31Horowitz A.D. Moussavian B. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L69-L79PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SP-C enhances surfactant lipid uptake by type II epithelial cells, functioning in a manner distinct from that of SP-A and SP-B, the latter serving to maintain large surfactant aggregates associated with the epithelial surfaces. Thus SP-C may have both intracellular and extracellular roles in surfactant homeostasis.Strain Influences the Pathologic Finding in the SP-C (−/−) MiceThe severe lung disease observed in the SP-C (−/−) mice in the 129/Sv strain contrasts sharply with the milder abnormalities seen in SP-C (−/−) mice when maintained in outbred Swiss black background. Whereas the SP-C (−/−) Swiss black mice do not have overt abnormalities in lung structure, these mice are susceptible to lung dysfunction when placed in hyperoxia and reduction of surfactant protein B (12Ikegami M. Weaver T.E. Conkright J.J. Sly P.D. Ross G.F. Whitsett J.A. Glasser S.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In recent studies with SP-C (−/−) Swiss black mice, we have observed pneumonitis in mice after 1 year of age. 2S. W. Glasser, E. A. Detmer, M. Ikegami, C.-L. Na, M. T. Stahlman, and J. A. Whitsett, unpublished observations. The strong strain-dependent influence on the SP-C (−/−) phenotype and the heterogeneity of pulmonary lesions that vary in severity, time, and place are consistent with findings in patients with familial idiopathic fibrosis caused by mutations in the sp-C gene (32Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. Chest. 2002; 121: S20-S21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These syndromes are clinically and pathologically distinct from the emphysema associated with α1-antitrypsin deficiency. In IIP, clinical and pathologic findings vary greatly in these sibships, and multiple histopathological diagnoses have been made within the same family. Whereas the nature of the SP-C mutations may influence the disorder, marked heterogeneity in severity, age of presentation, and time of progression of pulmonary disease characterizes this disorder, suggesting that environmental factors or other genes strongly influence its pathogenesis. The observed strain differences in the severity of lung disease caused by SP-C deficiency in the SP-C (−/−) mice suggest that the phenotype associated with SP-C deficiency or SP-C mutations may be strongly influenced by genetic factors. Whereas there is no evidence that infection complicated the interpretation of the present study, lung dysfunction in patients with IIP is exacerbated by infection.Implications for Diagnosis and TherapyThe present study and recent human studies (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 32Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. Chest. 2002; 121: S20-S21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) provide perhaps the first association between sp-C gene mutations and pulmonary disease. Because the absence of SP-C caused severe lung disease in the SP-C (−/−) mice, it is also possible that deficiency of SP-C, whether genetic or secondary to injury, may contribute to acute and chronic lung disease. The association between mutations in SP-C with IIP in humans makes feasible genetic testing for the risk of the disease. Likewise, histologic diagnosis of the various pathologies caused by mutations in the sp-C gene can be made by immunohistochemistry. Detection of mutant sp-C genes or the presence or absence of SP-C from BALF may provide diagnostic insights into the role of SP-C in patients with complex lung diseases. Finally, it is unclear whether human IIP is caused by the following: 1) the absence of SP-C and pro-SP-C; 2) misfolding and misrouting of either the SP-C proprotein or the active SP-C peptide; or 3) altered routing, processing, or degradation of other cellular components whose homeostasis is dependent upon pro-SP-C and/or SP-C. If protein misfolding in type II or other lung cells contributes to the pathogenesis of lung disease, the misfolding of proteins other than SP-C may be considered in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease. Clarification of cellular and molecular mechanisms causing interstitial lung disease related to abnormalities in SP-C may provide a conceptual basis for the development of new therapies for IIP. SP-C is a 34–35-amino acid peptide expressed selectively in type II epithelial cells in the alveolus of the lung (for review see Refs. 1Weaver T.E. Conkright J.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 555-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholarand 2Johansson J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A single sp-C gene is located on human chromosome 8 that is syntenic to that in the mouse located on chromosome 14. Thesp-C gene encodes a proprotein of 197 or 191 amino acids (pro-SP-C) that is palmitoylated, proteolytically processed, and routed through the rough endoplasmic reticulum and multivesicular bodies to lamellar bodies in which surfactant is stored. The SP-C peptide is secreted into the airspace where it enhances the stability and spreading of phospholipids. The SP-C peptide is highly hydrophobic and also contains two cysteine residues in an NH2-terminal domain. These cysteines are palmitoylated and located near an extended hydrophobic domain wherein 19 of 23 residues are valine, leucine, or isoleucine. This hydrophobic region forms an α-helical structure that spans a lipid bilayer (3Morrow M.R. Taneva S. Simatos G.A. Allwood L.A. Keough K.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11338-11344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both the α-helical domain and the cysteine-linked palmitoyl groups are tightly associated with phospholipids. SP-C disrupts phospholipid acyl chain packing and enhances recruitment of phospholipids to monolayers and multilayers at the air-liquid interface (4Horowitz A.D. Elledge B. Whitsett J.A. Baatz J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1107: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Johansson J. Szyperski T. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These features suggest a structural role for SP-C in facilitating the movement of phospholipids between multilayered films. Biological functions of purified SP-C or synthetic SP-C peptides are highly active in vitro and in vivo, enhancing surfactant properties of lipids and restoring lung function in surfactant-deficient animals (6Whitsett J.A.

Brown C. White T. Buckley D. Lesikar D. Benson B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 484-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These results indicate that SP-C plays an important role in the spreading and stabilization of phospholipid films in the alveolus. An unexpected role for SP-C in pulmonary homeostasis was provided by recent studies (8Nogee L.M. Dunbar A.E. Wert S.E. Askin F. Hamvas A. Whitsett J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 9Thomas A.Q. Lane K. Phillips III, J. Prince M. Markin C. Speer M. Schwartz D.A. Gaddipati R. Marney A. Johnson J. Roberts R.

Pulmonary disease in these patients was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.

We report here on the crystal structure of ferric P450BSβ in the substrate-bound form, determined at a resolution of 2.1 Å. P450BSβ exhibits a typical P450 fold. The substrate binds to a specific channel in the enzyme and is stabilized through hydrophobic interactions of its alkyl side chain with some hydrophobic residues on the enzyme as well as by electrostatic interaction of its terminal carboxylate with the Arg242 guanidium group. These interactions are responsible for the site specificity of the hydroxylation site in which the α- and β-positions of the fatty acid come into close proximity to the heme iron sixth site. The fatty acid carboxylate group interacts with Arg242 in the same fashion as has been reported for the active site of chloroperoxidase, His105-Glu183, which is an acid-base catalyst in the peroxidation reactions. On the basis of these observations, a possible mechanism for the hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by P450BSβ is proposed in which the carboxylate of the bound-substrate fatty acid assists in the cleavage of the peroxide O-O bond.

Two bacterial cytochrome P450s isolated from Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Bacillus subtilis, P450SPα 1The abbreviations used are: P450SPα, cytochrome P450 isolated from Sphingomonas paucimobilis ; P450BSβ, cytochrome P450 isolated fromBacillus subtilis ; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CPO, chloroperoxidase 1The abbreviations used are: P450SPα, cytochrome P450 isolated from Sphingomonas paucimobilis ; P450BSβ, cytochrome P450 isolated fromBacillus subtilis ; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CPO, chloroperoxidase and P450BSβ, respectively, are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation reaction of long chain fatty acids (e.g. myristic acid) using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant to produce hydroxylated (-OH) fatty acids (1Matsunaga I. Sumimoto T. Ueda A. Kusunose E. Ichihara K. Lipids. 2000; 35: 365-371Google Scholar, 2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar). In the enzymatic reactions, an oxygen atom derived from H2O2 is efficiently introduced into the substrate with a high catalytic turnover (1,000 min−1) (2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar, 3Matsunaga I. Yamada M. Kusunose E. Miki T. Ichihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 105-110Google Scholar, 4Matsunaga I. Yokotani N. Gotoh O. Kusunose E. Yamada M. Ichihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23592-23596Google Scholar). P450SPα produces the α-OH fatty acid (100%) as the product, whereas P450BSβproduces both the β-OH (60%) and the α-OH (40%) fatty acids (1Matsunaga I. Sumimoto T. Ueda A. Kusunose E. Ichihara K. Lipids. 2000; 35: 365-371Google Scholar,2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar, 4Matsunaga I. Yokotani N. Gotoh O. Kusunose E. Yamada M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1886-1892Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the two enzymes shares a 44% identity (2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar). Data base investigation has shown that P450SPα and P450BSβ belong to the P450 superfamily and, therefore, they have been given the systematic nomenclature designations CYP152B1 and CYP152A1, respectively (6Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Google Scholar). However, when compared with reactions catalyzed by other P450s, two characteristic properties in the P450SPα and P450BSβ reactions were found, i.e. the utilization of H2O2 and the site specificity of the reaction.In typical P450 reactions an oxygen atom derived from molecular oxygen (O2) is inserted into the substrates (7Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2888Google Scholar), and the reaction is referred to as a monooxygenation reaction. Two protons and two electrons are required in the monooxygenation reaction. The electrons are supplied from NAD(P)H through mediation by flavoproteins and iron-sulfur proteins, and the protons are probably delivered from solvent water to the active site through a specific hydrogen-bonding network (8Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Google Scholar). In the monooxygenase P450 system, H2O2 is sometimes used as a surrogate for the O2/2e−/2H+ system (peroxide shunt pathway), but the turnover rate in the peroxide shunt pathway is generally much lower than that in the reduction system-supported catalytic cycle. In contrast, P450SPα and P450BSβ did not require any reduction system of O2 for their catalysis. Indeed, ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and P450 reductase systems do not appear to function in the P450SPα and P450BSβreactions. 2I. Matsunaga, unpublished results. 2I. Matsunaga, unpublished results. Both enzymes specifically require H2O2 for their catalytic activities in place of O2/2e−/2H+, and, thus, the peroxide shunt pathway is the main route to hydroxylated fatty acid production. These bacterial P450 enzymes, therefore, should be appropriately designated as peroxygenase rather than monooxygenase (1Matsunaga I. Sumimoto T. Ueda A. Kusunose E. Ichihara K. Lipids. 2000; 35: 365-371Google Scholar, 2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar, 4Matsunaga I. Yokotani N. Gotoh O. Kusunose E. Yamada M.

Kusunose E. Yano I. Ichihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1554-1560Google Scholar).Concerning the site specificity of the reaction, the α- and β-hydroxylation of fatty acids by P450SPα and P450BSβ are very unique compared with monooxygenase P450s such as P450 from Bacillus megaterium (P450BM3), which are known to catalyze the hydroxylation at the ω-n(n = 1, 2, 3) sites of fatty acids. In the crystal structure of the substrate-bound form of P450BM3 it was found that the substrate (palmitoleic acid) binds to the enzyme through an ionic interaction of the carboxylate with a phenol group of Tyr51located on the protein surface and through hydrophobic interactions of the long alkyl chain with the hydrophobic interior of the protein (11Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Google Scholar). Most recently, Haines et al. (12Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Google Scholar) reported on the crystal structure of P450BM3 in which the carboxylate group of the substrate,N-palmitoylglycine, interacts with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Gln73 and Ala74 on the surface of the protein. In any event, such interactions result in the CH3-terminal (ω-position) of the alkyl chain of the fatty acid being located near the active center, leading to ω-1, ω-2, and ω-3 hydroxylated products. In contrast, P450SPα and P450BSβ give an α- and/or a β-OH fatty acid as the products of the hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, the α- and β-carbons (-CβH2-CαH2-COOH) must be located in close proximity to the heme active site. This suggests that the substrate-enzyme interaction for P450SPα and P450BSβ is entirely different from that for P450BM3. The difference in the site specificity of the reaction must be due to differences in structures involved in the substrate recognition between peroxygenase P450s (P450SPαand P450BSβ) and monooxygenase P450s.To address these two issues concerning the unique peroxygenases P450BSβ and P450SPα properties, we attempted to crystallize the enzymes for crystallographic analyses. Fortunately, we were successful in obtaining a crystal of P450BSβ (13Lee D.S. Yamada A. Matsunaga I. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 687-689Google Scholar) and report herein on its crystal structures determined at 2.1-Å resolution, which provide the structural basis of understanding the characteristic properties of the peroxygenase P450BSβ described above.

Lipids. 2000; 35: 365-371Google Scholar,2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar, 4Matsunaga I. Yokotani N. Gotoh O. Kusunose E. Yamada M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1886-1892Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the two enzymes shares a 44% identity (2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar). Data base investigation has shown that P450SPα and P450BSβ belong to the P450 superfamily and, therefore, they have been given the systematic nomenclature designations CYP152B1 and CYP152A1, respectively (6Nelson D.R. Kamataki T. Waxman D.J. Guengerich F.P. Estabrook R.W. Feyereisen R. Gonzalez F.J. Coon M.J. Gunsalus I.C. Gotoh O. Okuda K. Nebert D.W. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 1-51Google Scholar). However, when compared with reactions catalyzed by other P450s, two characteristic properties in the P450SPα and P450BSβ reactions were found, i.e. the utilization of H2O2 and the site specificity of the reaction. In typical P450 reactions an oxygen atom derived from molecular oxygen (O2) is inserted into the substrates (7Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2888Google Scholar), and the reaction is referred to as a monooxygenation reaction. Two protons and two electrons are required in the monooxygenation reaction. The electrons are supplied from NAD(P)H through mediation by flavoproteins and iron-sulfur proteins, and the protons are probably delivered from solvent water to the active site through a specific hydrogen-bonding network (8Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Google Scholar). In the monooxygenase P450 system, H2O2 is sometimes used as a surrogate for the O2/2e−/2H+ system (peroxide shunt pathway), but the turnover rate in the peroxide shunt pathway is generally much lower than that in the reduction system-supported catalytic cycle. In contrast, P450SPα and P450BSβ did not require any reduction system of O2 for their catalysis. Indeed, ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and P450 reductase systems do not appear to function in the P450SPα and P450BSβreactions. 2I. Matsunaga, unpublished results. 2I. Matsunaga, unpublished results. Both enzymes specifically require H2O2 for their catalytic activities in place of O2/2e−/2H+, and, thus, the peroxide shunt pathway is the main route to hydroxylated fatty acid production. These bacterial P450 enzymes, therefore, should be appropriately designated as peroxygenase rather than monooxygenase (1Matsunaga I. Sumimoto T. Ueda A. Kusunose E. Ichihara K. Lipids. 2000; 35: 365-371Google Scholar, 2Matsunaga I. Ueda A. Fujiwara N. Sumimoto T. Ichihara K. Lipids. 1999; 34: 841-846Google Scholar, 4Matsunaga I. Yokotani N. Gotoh O. Kusunose E. Yamada M.

Kusunose E. Yano I. Ichihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1554-1560Google Scholar). Concerning the site specificity of the reaction, the α- and β-hydroxylation of fatty acids by P450SPα and P450BSβ are very unique compared with monooxygenase P450s such as P450 from Bacillus megaterium (P450BM3), which are known to catalyze the hydroxylation at the ω-n(n = 1, 2, 3) sites of fatty acids. In the crystal structure of the substrate-bound form of P450BM3 it was found that the substrate (palmitoleic acid) binds to the enzyme through an ionic interaction of the carboxylate with a phenol group of Tyr51located on the protein surface and through hydrophobic interactions of the long alkyl chain with the hydrophobic interior of the protein (11Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Google Scholar). Most recently, Haines et al. (12Haines D.C. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13456-13465Google Scholar) reported on the crystal structure of P450BM3 in which the carboxylate group of the substrate,N-palmitoylglycine, interacts with the backbone nitrogen atoms of Gln73 and Ala74 on the surface of the protein. In any event, such interactions result in the CH3-terminal (ω-position) of the alkyl chain of the fatty acid being located near the active center, leading to ω-1, ω-2, and ω-3 hydroxylated products. In contrast, P450SPα and P450BSβ give an α- and/or a β-OH fatty acid as the products of the hydroxylation reaction. Therefore, the α- and β-carbons (-CβH2-CαH2-COOH) must be located in close proximity to the heme active site. This suggests that the substrate-enzyme interaction for P450SPα and P450BSβ is entirely different from that for P450BM3. The difference in the site specificity of the reaction must be due to differences in structures involved in the substrate recognition between peroxygenase P450s (P450SPαand P450BSβ) and monooxygenase P450s. To address these two issues concerning the unique peroxygenases P450BSβ and P450SPα properties, we attempted to crystallize the enzymes for crystallographic analyses. Fortunately, we were successful in obtaining a crystal of P450BSβ (13Lee D.S. Yamada A. Matsunaga I. Ichihara K. Adachi S. Park S.Y. Shiro Y. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 687-689Google Scholar) and report herein on its crystal structures determined at 2.1-Å resolution, which provide the structural basis of understanding the characteristic properties of the peroxygenase P450BSβ described above."

Here we investigated the role of complement in the induction of tolerance after intraocular injection. We found that the development of antigen-specific tolerance is dependent on a complement activation product. The ligation of the complement C3 activation product iC3b to complement receptor type 3 (the iC3b receptor) on antigen-presenting cells resulted in the sequential production of transforming growth factor-beta2 and interleukin-10, which is essential for the induction of tolerance. These observations may extend to the development of both neonatal tolerance and other forms of acquired tolerance."

The internal disulfide linkage in the immunoglobulin fold is of particular importance for most proteins in the immunoglobulin superfamily because this linkage has a critical influence on the stability of these proteins (1Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1433-1441Google Scholar, 2Glockshuber R. Schmidt T. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1270-1279Google Scholar). The linkage, which is highly conserved, connects two β-sheets in a sandwich structure (3Alzari P.M. Lascombe M.B. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 555-580Google Scholar, 4Hunkapiller T.

J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 891-910Google Scholar) were the first to analyze intrachain disulfide bond formation in the constant fragments of the immunoglobulin light chain (CL), 1The abbreviations used are: CL, light chain of immunoglobulin constant regions; bis-ANS, 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid dipotassium salt; β-ME, 2-mercaptoethanol; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); FT-IR, Fourier transformed-infrared; Fv, fragment of immunoglobulin variable regions; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; HyHEL-10, mouse anti-lysozyme monoclonal antibody; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight; scFv, single-chain Fv fragment; VH, heavy chain domain in Fv; VL, light chain in Fv demonstrating the contribution of the disulfide linkage to the stabilization and folding of the CL domain. For the variable fragment in antibody molecules (Fv), which is composed of heavy and light chain domains (VH and VL, respectively), the immunoglobulin fold is known to be partially and irreversibly denatured to an aggregate under reducing conditions (2Glockshuber R. Schmidt T. Plückthun A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1270-1279Google Scholar); furthermore, the instability of the Fv that is missing its disulfide linkages has been proved by natural antibodies missing a disulfide linkage (8Proba K. Honegger A. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 161-172Google Scholar) and replacement of the essential cysteinyl residue by serine residue (9Langedijk A.C. Honegger A. Maat J. Planta R.J. van Schaik R.C. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 95-110Google Scholar). Recently, the folding kinetics and aggregation behavior of the single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) after removal of the disulfide linkages have been analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy and a combination of mass spectrometry and an H/D exchange technique (10Ramm K. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 535-546Google Scholar,11Jäger M. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 1111-1129Google Scholar). In the folding of the disulfide-containing scFv in vitro, the presence of the disulfide linkage accelerates the independent folding of the VH and VL domains, and then the domains are associated with each other to form the correct quaternary structure. For the scFv with a domain containing no cysteinyl residues, the disulfide-free domain refolds more slowly than the disulfide-containing domain in the same scFv, and refolding requires an interface on the domain with a native disulfide linkage to form a functional structure (10Ramm K. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 535-546Google Scholar). It has also been noted that when VH folds prior to interaction with the VLdomain, the native structure results, whereas when the stable VL domain is formed before VH, aggregate formation is likely (10Ramm K. Gehrig P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 535-546Google Scholar). Antibody molecules are one of the key proteins for diagnostics in medicine and various researches in the field of proteomics (12Carter P. Merchant A.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 449-454Google Scholar, 13Holt L.J. Enever C. de Wildt R.M. Tomlinson I.M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 445-449Google Scholar). Bacterial expression systems for recombinant proteins, especially systems using Escherichia coli, have been utilized to produce tailor-made antibody molecules such as scFv and Fab fragments (14Plückthun A. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 130: 151-188Google Scholar, 15Skerra A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 256-262Google Scholar). However, the expression of antibodies in E. coliis usually limited to the periplasm because the reducing condition in the cytoplasm rules out the formation of disulfide linkages that is crucial for the immunoglobulin fold. Furthermore, the secretory expression of most scFv and Fab fragments involves insoluble aggregated forms called inclusion bodies in the periplasm (14Plückthun A. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 130: 151-188Google Scholar, 16Field H. Yarranton G.T. Rees A.R. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 641-647Google Scholar), and some antibody fragments cannot be expressed even as inclusion bodies (17Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18551-18557Google Scholar). Consequently, a few other systems have been developed for the production of functional antibodies from E. coli, for example, direct production of functional scFv in the cytoplasm by the coexpression of disulfide bond chaperones (18Jurado P. Ritz D. Beckwith J. de Lorenzo V. Fernández L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1-10Google Scholar), and refolding of recombinant antibody fragments from inclusion bodies in vitro (19Buchner J. Rudolph R. Biotechnology. 1991; 9: 157-162Google Scholar). The coexpression system is a recent development, but the refolding approach has been utilized for a decade to renature scFv and Fab fragments from their aggregated forms (2Glockshuber R. Schmidt T.

The general refolding system is based on dilution of denatured protein in a refolding buffer, and thiol-disulfide interchange reaction is applied to the system in order to increase the yield of refolding. However, the dilution method does not always result in a high refolding yield, and a more efficient method is needed. Recently, we proposed (23Tsumoto K. Shinoki K. Kondo H. Uchikawa M. Juji T. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 219: 119-129Google Scholar) an improved refolding system for completely unfolded antibody molecules with reduced cysteinyl residues, a system based on the gradual removal of the denaturing reagent by means of stepwise dialysis. The refolding yield and the recovery of biological activity are greater than 95% in the case of various scFvs. Disulfide exchange and suppression of protein aggregation are controlled by the addition of the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) andl-arginine at appropriate stages (23Tsumoto K. Shinoki K. Kondo H. Uchikawa M. Juji T. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 219: 119-129Google Scholar). The high refolding yield, however, has not yet been evaluated in the view of physical and chemical studies, which are critically important for elucidating the stepwise folding process that leads to the completely functional scFv and for understanding how GSSG and l-arginine influence the folding pathway. In this paper, we present spectroscopic studies on the refolding process of the scFv from a mouse anti-lysozyme monoclonal antibody, HyHEL-10, in our stepwise dialysis system. We measured CD and tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra for the scFv solution at each stage to observe the conformational changes in the secondary and tertiary structures. We also used 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid dipotassium salt (bis-ANS) analysis to probe hydrophobic area formation on scFv during the dialysis, and the analysis indicated a correlation between aggregation and the formation of an exposed hydrophobic area on scFv. Quantification of the free thiol groups in scFv, by means of Ellman's assay and mass spectrometry experiments, indicated that the pathway of disulfide bond formation in the presence of l-arginine was essentially different from the pathway in the solution containing only GdnHCl. The secondary structure and the number of free thiol groups for an aggregated scFv in the stepwise dialysis system were estimated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and Ellman's assay, and we discuss the factors leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates at each stage. The folding pathway for scFv depended strongly on the additives (GSSG and l-arginine), and the addition of these reagents at a particular stage enabled scFv to be refolded in high yield with recovery of biological activity. The plasmid containing the HyHEL-10 scFv (VL-linker-VH–(His)6) cDNA was constructed by insertion of the NcoI–XbaI fragment of pUTN3 (24Tsumoto K. Nakaoki Y. Ueda Y. Ogasahara K. Yutani K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 546-551Google Scholar) into the NcoI–XbaI-digested plasmid pUT7 (25Uchiyama H. Perez-Prat E.M. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Kuwajima K. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 1153-1161Google Scholar). Transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were incubated in 2× YT medium at 28 °C, and expression of the HyHEL-10 scFv under the control of the T7 promoter was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The harvested cells were centrifuged and suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 200 mm NaCl. After sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 5,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended several times in the 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 4% Triton X-100 and 200 mmNaCl to remove nonspecifically adsorbed proteins, and the solution was centrifuged again at 5,800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C (23Tsumoto K. Shinoki K. Kondo H. Uchikawa M. Juji T. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 219: 119-129Google Scholar). After the removal step was repeated, the pellet was washed in water to remove Triton X-100, and then it was solubilized in the 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 6 m GdnHCl and 200 mm NaCl. The solubilized scFv was refined by means of 1) a metal-chelate chromatography column that interacted with the histidine tag in scFv and 2) a gel filtration chromatography column (Sephacryl S-200). The concentration of the unfolded HyHEL-10 scFv was adjusted to 7.5 μm in the 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 6 m GdnHCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA, and the fragment was reduced by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) at a 50-fold molar excess relative to the protein. After β-ME was removed by dialysis against the same Tris-HCl buffer without β-ME, the unfolded scFv was refolded by gradual removal of GdnHCl by means of stepwise dialysis from 6 to 0 m through 3, 2, 1, and 0.5 m by one of the following four methods (Fig.1): (a) the concentration of GdnHCl was decreased by stepwise dialysis without any additives; (b) GSSG (50-fold molar excess relative to protein) was added at the 1 and 0.5 m GdnHCl stages; (c) 400 mml-arginine was added at the 1 and 0.5m GdnHCl stages; and (d) GSSG (50-fold molar excess relative to protein) and l-arginine (400 mm) were added at the 1 and 0.5 m GdnHCl stages. Absorption spectra were measured on a U-3000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Japan) in a 1-cm cuvette. CD spectra were measured on a J-720w spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc. Japan) as follows: path length, 1.0 mm; bandwidth, 1.0 nm; resolution, 0.1 nm; response time, 8 s; scan speed, 5 nm/min; and number of scans, 4. The spectra of the scFv solutions at each stage of the dialysis were directly measured, but the CD spectra of the solution containing aggregated particles were measured after the removal of the particles by centrifugation. Fluorescence spectra were recorded for each stage with an RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Co. Japan) in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were measured for the scFv solution at a concentration of 0.5 μm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, and bis-ANS fluorescence spectra were measured at an excitation wavelength of 395 nm 10 min after bis-ANS was mixed with scFv in a 1:10 ratio (bis-ANS, 0.38 μm; scFv, 3.8 μm). The scFv solutions containing aggregated particles were utilized after the removal of the particles by centrifugation. Diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectra were obtained on an FTS-165 (Bio-Rad); the aggregated form of scFv was dried under vacuum and then mixed with KBr at about 1% (w/w). Ellman's assay was applied to the scFv solutions at each stage, and the scFv was denatured by the dialysis from the scFv solutions at each stage to 6 mGdnHCl solution (100 mm potassium phosphate HCl (pH 5), 1 mm EDTA). Each scFv solution was diluted to 1.5 μm with the Tris-HCl buffer keeping each GdnHCl concentration after aggregated particles had been removed by centrifugation, and then 50 μl of 10 mm DTNB solution (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mmEDTA) was added to 1.25 ml of the diluted scFv solution. The absorbance at 412 nm was monitored after the addition of DTNB, and the number of the free thiol groups in an scFv was calculated from the extinction coefficient of nitrothiophenol, which is generated by reaction of DTNB with a thiol group. The exact extinction coefficient of nitrothiophenol was estimated in each solution by reaction with the reduced form of GSH because the coefficient depended on the concentrations of GdnHCl andl-arginine. For quantification of the free thiol groups in the aggregated scFv in the stepwise dialysis, the aggregated particles were collected by centrifugation at each stage so that the insoluble particles aggregated at the different stage did not become mixed, e.g. the dialysis from 1 m GdnHCl to 0.5 m was carried out after the removal of the aggregated particles formed at the 1m stage. The aggregated scFv at each stage was dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl at pH 5 before the assay was carried out. An iodoacetic acid solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) was added to the scFv solution obtained from each stage (final concentrations: iodoacetic acid, 1 mm; scFv, 5 μm), and the pH was adjusted to 8 with an NaOH solution. After 30 min, the alkylated scFv solution was dialyzed to 2 m GdnHCl to remove the residual iodoacetic acid and to standardize the concentration of GdnHCl. For alkylation of the scFv in the denatured state, the scFv solutions from each stage were dialyzed to 6 m GdnHCl (100 mm potassium phosphate-HCl, pH 5, 1 mm EDTA), and then the iodoacetic acid solution was added to the denatured scFv solutions. Mass spectra were measured on a REFLEX III matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Analytische, GmbH, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 nm). Sinapic acid was applied as a matrix and was dissolved to saturation in water/acetonitrile (2:1, v/v) containing 0.067% trifluoroacetic acid. Sample solutions from each stage were mixed with the sinapic acid-saturated solution in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio, and then 1 μl of the mixed solution was loaded onto the sample target. After co-crystallization on the target, the crystals were washed 2 times with 2 μl of water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to remove GdnHCl and other salts. Analysis was performed in positive and linear modes with an accelerating voltage of 27 kV, and 200 scans were averaged. The spectra obtained were calibrated externally using the [M + H+] ions from two protein standards: cytochrome c from horse heart (m/z 12360.08) and bovine trypsin (m/z 23311.53). We used the absorbance at 320 nm as a probe for suspension of scFv in the stepwise dialysis system (Fig. 2). No suspension was observed in solutions at GdnHCl concentrations higher than 2m. A rapid increase in the 320 nm absorbance was observed at the 1 m GdnHCl stage only for the simple GdnHCl solution, i.e. the solution without the GSSG andl-arginine additives (Fig. 2); this increase indicated aggregation of scFv in the solution. In contrast, no scFv aggregates formed at the 1 m GdnHCl stage in the solutions with GSSG or l-arginine (Fig. 2). These additives suppressed aggregation in the dialysis from 2 to 1 m. At the 0.5m GdnHCl stage, aggregation was observed in all the solutions except for the optimal GdnHCl solution, which contained both GSSG and l-arginine (Fig. 2), although the additives promoted the folding of scFv to some extent. The aggregation of scFv at the 0.5 m GdnHCl stage of stepwise dialysis could be suppressed only by the addition of both GSSG andl-arginine. Fig.3 shows the CD spectra of scFv in the simple GdnHCl solution at each stage of the stepwise dialysis. In the 6m GdnHCl solution, the CD spectrum of scFv showed no characteristic CD signals derived from secondary structure in the region of 215–225 nm and instead showed a rather large trough with a tail extending beyond 220 nm, which implies random structure (Fig.3 a). Spectra with extended tails were also observed for the 3 and 2 m GdnHCl solutions, and no secondary structure was observed (Fig. 3, b and c). For the solutions of scFv in 1, 0.5, and 0 m GdnHCl, the CD spectra were measured after insoluble scFv aggregates were removed by centrifugation. Although the CD spectra still indicated random structure in the 1 and 0.5 m GdnHCl solutions, the random component got small around 210–220 nm, and a new trough appeared at 218 nm (Fig. 3, d and e). The 218-nm trough could be derived from a polypeptide with β-strand structure. In the 0m GdnHCl solution, in which scFv was folded, the 218-nm trough was also observed, and there was no CD signal for random structure (Fig. 3 f). Therefore, the secondary structure of scFv was mainly formed upon dialysis from the 2 m GdnHCl solution, and the refolded scFv has a structure rich in β-strands. The CD spectrum of scFv at the 1 m GdnHCl stage was also measured in the GdnHCl solution with GSSG (Fig.4). Comparison of the spectra in the GdnHCl solution with those in GdnHCl-GSSG solution clearly showed that more β-strand structure was formed in the presence of GSSG. Becausel-arginine has strong CD intensity in the measured region, we could not measure the CD spectra of scFv in the GdnHCl solutions with l-arginine.Figure 4CD spectra of scFv at the 1 m GdnHCl stage in the simple GdnHCl solution (solid line) and the GdnHCl-GSSG solution (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The folding of scFv in the dialysis system was also explored by means of the change in the tryptophan fluorescence emission maximum (Fig.5). The scFv has six tryptophan residues (four in VH and two in VL), and all the residues except for Trp-95 in VH are buried inside the native structure (27Kondo H. Shiroishi M. Matsushima M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Google Scholar). The tryptophan molecules in scFv showed an intense emission with a maximum at 353 nm in the 6 m GdnHCl solution, and the emission was slightly blue-shifted in the 3 and 2m GdnHCl solutions. These results indicate that the tryptophans were exposed to the hydrophilic solvent because of the fact that scFv was unfolded at GdnHCl concentrations higher than 2m, even though the environment around tryptophans was a little changed by the decreasing of GdnHCl concentration. In all the refolding solutions, a large blue-shift to 346 nm was observed as the GdnHCl concentration changed from 2 to 1 m, and the fluorescence intensity also decreased at this same stage (data not shown). The blue-shift and accompanying decrease of intensity were also observed in the dialysates from 1 to 0.5 m GdnHCl and from 0.5 to 0 m. Decreasing the GdnHCl concentration to less than 2 m drastically changed the environment around the scFv tryptophan residues. These results, along with the CD spectra (Fig. 3), indicate that the secondary and tertiary structures in scFv began forming at the same stage (1 m GdnHCl stage). In dialysis systems in which GSSG or l-arginine was applied, the tryptophan molecules showed emission changes similar to those observed in the simple GdnHCl solutions, except for the fact that the tryptophan emissions were more blue-shifted at the 1 and 0.5m GdnHCl stages in the solutions with GSSG orl-arginine (Fig. 5). This result suggests that scFv folded more promptly in the GdnHCl solution with GSSG orl-arginine than it did in the simple GdnHCl solution. In order to probe the hydrophobicity of scFv, we measured the fluorescence intensity of bis-ANS in the presence of scFv by adding bis-ANS to the scFv-GdnHCl solution at each stage of the dialysis (Fig.6). The weak bis-ANS fluorescence in the 6 m GdnHCl solution was equal in intensity to the fluorescence in the scFv-free GdnHCl solution, which indicates that no hydrophobic area formed on scFv, because of its completely unfolded stage (28Goto Y. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 945-952Google Scholar, 29Chapeaurouge A. Johansson J.S. Ferreira S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14861-14866Google Scholar). In contrast, bis-ANS became highly fluorescent as the concentration of GdnHCl was decreased to 3 and 2 m (Fig. 6). This result, which differed from the CD and tryptophan emission results (Figs. 3 and5), indicates that a hydrophobic area on scFv was formed without discernible secondary and tertiary structures even at the high GdnHCl concentrations of 3 and 2 m. The bis-ANS fluorescence was further enhanced at the 1 m GdnHCl stage, during which the secondary and tertiary structures were forming. The hydrophobic area on scFv was most exposed to the solvent at the 0.5 m GdnHCl stage in all the refolding solutions, except for the simple GdnHCl solution, in which the bis-ANS had similar fluorescence intensity at GdnHCl concentrations of 1 and 0.5 m (Fig. 6). Comparison of the bis-ANS result with the observation of 320-nm absorbance indicates a connection between the extent of the hydrophobic area on scFv and aggregation of scFv at the 0.5 m GdnHCl stage (Figs. 2 and 6). The hydrophobic area on scFv did not expand from the 1 m GdnHCl stage in the simple GdnHCl solution, despite the fact that the bis-ANS fluorescence intensity at the 1 mGdnHCl stage was comparable to the intensities in the other three solutions (GdnHCl-GSSG, GdnHCl-l-arginine, and optimal GdnHCl solutions). The conformational change at the 0.5 mGdnHCl stage may be insufficient in the simple GdnHCl solution because there is nothing to stabilize the hydrophobic area. At the 0m GdnHCl stage, at which GSSG and l-arginine were removed as well as GdnHCl, the size of the hydrophobic area on scFv rapidly decreased in all cases (Fig. 6). This result suggests that the VL and VH domains become stacked at the final stage. The free thiol groups in untreated and denatured (6 m GdnHCl) scFv were quantified at each stage by means of Ellman's assay. The pH of the denaturing solution was adjusted to 5.0 in order to prevent formation of disulfide linkage in the denaturing process. The average number of free thiol groups in scFv at the 6 m GdnHCl stage was 3.0 despite scFv having four thiol groups, indicating that a few thiol groups were naturally oxidized even in the 6 m GdnHCl solution. When the GdnHCl concentration was decreased from 6 to 3 m, the number of free thiol groups in scFv decreased from 3 to 1.5 for the untreated scFv (Fig. 7 a), whereas the same number of free thiol groups was detected in the scFv denatured from the 6 and 3 m GdnHCl stages (Fig. 7 b). A similar discrepancy in the number of free thiol groups at the 3m GdnHCl stage was also observed at the 2 mGdnHCl stage, although the difference was smaller than that at the 3m GdnHCl stage. This result reveals that the scFv structure in the 3 and 2 m GdnHCl solutions hinders DTNB access to the thiol groups, which supports the bis-ANS results suggesting that some structure was formed at the 3 and 2 m GdnHCl stages. In the dialysis from 2 m GdnHCl, oxidation of free thiol groups was significantly dependent upon the composition of the refolding solutions. In the GdnHCl solution without additives (Fig.7 a), the free thiol groups in the 2 m GdnHCl solution were spontaneously oxidized by disulfide bond formation only in the dialysis from 2 to 1 m; consequently, some free thiol groups remained even at the 0 m GdnHCl stage. These results indicate that natural oxidization cannot make a sufficient number of disulfide linkages in scFv. For the GdnHCl solutions with GSSG, Ellman's assay was used after complete exclusion of the oxidizing reagent by dialysis. The assay showed that the addition of GSSG left few free thiol groups at the 1 and 0.5 m GdnHCl stages (Fig. 7 b). We attempted to detect the binding of GSSG to scFv by mass spectrometry, but the scFv without GSSG was enhanced in the GdnHCl-GSSG solution at the 1 m GdnHCl stage (data not shown). Therefore, the addition of GSSG enabled sufficient disulfide-bond formation in scFv at the 1 m GdnHCl stage. Ellman's assay also distinguished an essentially distinct disulfide bond formation pathway in the presence of l-arginine (Fig.7 c). In the presence of l-arginine, the results differed from those observed for the simple GdnHCl and GdnHCl-GSSG solutions (Fig. 7, a and b); the th"

Nuclear hormone receptors that heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR), such as thyroid receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and liver X receptors, modulate lipid metabolism. We recently demonstrated that these nuclear hormone receptors are repressed during the acute phase response induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), consistent with the known decreases in genes that they regulate. In the present study, we show that LPS significantly decreases farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mRNA in mouse liver as early as 8 h after LPS administration, and this decrease was dose-dependent with the half-maximal effect observed at 0.5 μg/100 g of body weight. Gel-shift experiments demonstrated that DNA binding activity to an FXR response element (IR1) is significantly reduced by LPS treatment. Supershift experiments demonstrated that the shifted protein-DNA complex contains FXR and RXR. Furthermore, the expression of FXR target genes, SHP and apoCII, were significantly reduced by LPS (70 and 60%, respectively). Also, LPS decreases hepatic LRH expression in mouse, which may explain the reduced expression of CYP7A1 in the face of SHP repression. In Hep3B human hepatoma cells, both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) significantly decreased FXR mRNA, whereas IL-6 did not have any effect. TNF and IL-1 also decreased the DNA binding activity to an IR1 response element and the expression of SHP and apoCII. Importantly, TNF and IL-1 almost completely blocked the expression of luciferase activity linked to a FXR response element promoter construct transfected into Hep3B cells. Together with our earlier studies on the repression of RXRs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, LXRs, thyroid receptors, constitutive androstane receptor, and pregnane X receptor, these results suggest that decreases in nuclear hormone receptors are major contributors to the decreased gene expression that occurs in the negative acute phase response.

Among these, changes in lipid metabolism have received much attention due to the link between infection/inflammatory diseases and atherosclerosis (2Libby P. Egan D. Skarlatos S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4095-4103Google Scholar, 3Jousilahti P. Vartiainen E. Tuomilehto J. Puska P. Lancet. 1996; 348: 567-572Google Scholar, 4Ridker P.M. Hennekens C.H. Buring J.E. Rifai N. N. Engl.

These changes are mediated by alterations in gene expression caused by pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 (10Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism by which these cytokines regulate gene transcription is not well understood, especially for the negative acute phase proteins. Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in various biological processes including development and physiological homeostasis (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar). Small lipophilic molecules such as steroids, thyroid hormones, vitamin D, and retinoids bind to and activate these receptors to exert their physiological effects by regulating the transcription of specific genes (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar, 14Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Google Scholar, 15Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M. Science. 1999; 284: 757-760Google Scholar). These receptors share common structural features, including central, highly conserved DNA binding domains and carboxyl-terminal ligand binding domains (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar, 14Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3149-3155Google Scholar, 15Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. Willson T.M. Science. 1999; 284: 757-760Google Scholar). They can be divided into four major subgroups based on their dimerization and DNA binding properties. Type II receptors are characterized by their DNA binding as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar, 16Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Google Scholar). This group includes the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), retinoic acid receptor, vitamin D receptor, liver X receptor (LXR), and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) (13Mangelsdorf D.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). The farnesoid X receptor (FXR) was once an orphan receptor, and recently, it was found that bile acids are the ligands for FXR (18Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y.

Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Google Scholar). FXR forms an obligate heterodimer with RXR and, thus, belongs to the Type II nuclear receptor subgroup. FXR has been shown to bind to FXR response elements (FXRE) composed of two inverted hexanucleotide repeats (AGGTCA) spaced by one nucleotide (IR-1) (21Laffitte B.A. Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Zavacki A.M.

Activation of FXR down-regulates the expression of CYP7A1 via the action of SHP protein (26Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C.

FXR-induced SHP binds to and inactivates the liver receptor homolog 1(LRH), a transcription factor that is required for the expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) (26Goodwin B. Jones S.A.

Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Google Scholar). CYP7A1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the neutral pathway of bile acid synthesis (28Chiang J.Y.L. Front Biosci. 1998; 3: 176-193Google Scholar), and therefore, FXR activation inhibits bile acid biosynthesis. Because bile acid is synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and is the major route for the elimination of cholesterol from the body, regulation of CYP7A1 transcription and activity indicates a critical role of FXR in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. A number of genes involved in lipid metabolism whose hepatic expression is decreased during the acute phase response are known to be regulated by type II nuclear hormone receptors. Previously, we demonstrated that in Syrian hamsters, LPS administration results in a decrease in hepatic mRNA and/or protein levels of RXRα, -β, and -γ, PPARα and -γ, TRα and -β, and LXRα (29Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Google Scholar, 30Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E228-E236Google Scholar). Furthermore, hepatic nuclear extracts obtained from animals treated with LPS exhibited a reduced binding activity to RXR-RXR, RXR-PPAR, RXR-TR, and RXR-LXR response elements (29Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Google Scholar, 30Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E228-E236Google Scholar). This suggests that reduced hepatic RXR levels alone or in combination with decreases in PPARs and LXR could be a mechanism for coordinately inhibiting the expression of multiple genes during the acute phase response. Expression of two proteins that are regulated by FXR, bile salt export pump (BSEP) (31Hartmann G. Cheung A.K. Piquette-Miller M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 303: 273-281Google Scholar) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) (32Jiang X.C. Bruce C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17133-17138Google Scholar), are decreased during the APR. Therefore, we hypothesized that the bile acid receptor FXR is also suppressed during APR, affecting lipid/cholesterol metabolism. In the present study, we demonstrate that LPS and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1β decrease the expression of FXR, its DNA binding activity to FXR response element (IR1), and transcription by FXR in studies of mice in vivo and the Hep3B human hepatoma cells in vitro, which is accompanied by decreased expression of FXR-regulated genes, SHP, and apoCII. The data suggest that altered FXR activity may contribute to the changes in lipid and cholesterol metabolism that occur during the APR. LPS (Escherichia coli 55:B5) was obtained from Difco and freshly diluted to the desired concentration in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline. Minimum essential medium (MEM) was purchased from Fisher. Cytokines (human TNFα, human IL-1β, and human IL-6) were from R&D Systems and were freshly diluted to desired concentrations in serum-free MEM media containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). Tri-Reagent and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligo(dT)-cellulose type 77F was fromAmersham Biosciences. Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were maintained in a normal light-cycle room and were provided with rodent chow and water ad libitum. Anesthesia was induced with halothane. To determine the effect of APR on FXR and other mRNA levels, mice were injected IP with 100 μg of LPS in saline or with saline alone. Food was withdrawn at the time of injection, because LPS induces anorexia in rodents (33Grunfeld C. Zhao C. Fuller J. Pollack A. Moser A. Friedman J. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2152-2157Google Scholar). Livers were removed at the time indicated in the figure legends (Figs. 1, 2, 4) after treatment.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+- and Mg2+-free) and trypsinized before seeding. For typical experiments, cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/dish. After an overnight incubation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and medium was replaced with fresh MEM (without serum) plus 0.1% bovine albumin and the appropriate cytokine concentration. For transfection assays, 1.5 × 105 cells were used/well in 6-well plates. Total RNA from mouse was isolated from 300–400 mg of snap-frozen whole liver and ∼100 mg of kidney tissue using Tri-Reagent (Sigma). Poly(A)+ RNA was subsequently purified using oligo(dT) cellulose. RNA was quantified by measuring absorption at 260 nm. 10 μg of poly(A)+ were denatured and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose, formaldehyde gel. Total RNA from Hep3B was isolated from a 100-mm dish by the Tri-Reagent method and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. 30 μg of total RNA was denatured and electrophoresed as described above. The uniformity of sample loading was checked by UV visualization of the ethidium bromide-stained gel before electrotransfer to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing procedures were performed as described previously (34Memon R.A. Fuller J. Moser A.H. Smith P.J. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E64-E72Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs using the random priming technique (Amersham Biosciences). mRNA levels were detected by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film and quantified by densitometry. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control probe. LRH-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Kristina Schoonjans (Institut de Genetique et de Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Universite Louis Pasteur, Paris, France). Mouse and human FXR, SHP, and apoCII probes were prepared by PCR using the following primers: FXR 5′-CGT GAC TTG CGN CAA GTG ACC-3′ (upper), 5′-CCA NGA CAT CAG CAT CTC AGC-3′ (lower); SHP 5′-AGG GGT CTG CCC ATG CCA G-3′ (upper), 5′-GGT CAC CTC AGC AAA AGC ATG TC-3′ (lower); apoCII 5′-GCC AAG GAG GTT GCC AAA G-3′ (upper), 5′-GGT CTG GTG ATG CGA GCA A-3′ (lower). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Neish et al. (35Neish A.S. Khachigian L.M. Park A. Baichwal V.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28903-28909Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were disrupted in a sucrose-HEPES buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet-P40 as a detergent, protease inhibitors, and dithiothreitol. After disruption by 5 min of incubation on ice and centrifugation, nuclear proteins were separated in a NaCl-HEPES buffer and re-suspended in a glycerol-containing buffer. All the procedures were carried out on ice. Protein quantification was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and yields were similar in control and cytokine-treated groups. 10 μg of crude nuclear extract were incubated on ice for 30 min with 6 × 104cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides in 15 μl of binding buffer consisting of 20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 50 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis (constant voltage of 200 V) on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA at 4 °C. The gel was dried, exposed to x-ray film, and quantified by densitometry. In the competition assay, a 100-fold molar excess of the specific or mutated unlabeled oligonucleotide was preincubated on ice for 1 h with 10 μg of nuclear extract from control cells. The following oligonucleotides were used: IR1, 5′-GATCGGCCAGGGTGAATAACCTCGGGG-3′; mut-IR1, 5′-GATCGGCCAGGAAGAATATTCTCGGGG-3′. Hep3B cells were grown overnight in 35-mm plates and washed twice with serum-free medium. DNA-Lipofectin complex containing 1.5 μg/ml FXRE-luciferase vector (a gift from Dr. Mangelsdorf, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), 0.5 μg/ml Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase vector (a gift from Dr. Allan Pollock, Nephrology section at Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA), and 5 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) were allowed to form at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were overlaid with the DNA-Lipofectin complex and incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h. After washing the cells with serum-free medium, fresh growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Transfected cells were treated with lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and aliquots of the lysates were assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activity as described in the manufacturer's instruction using Wallac VICTOR2™ 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). β-Galactosidase enzyme activity was used to normalize for variability in the transfection efficiency. Data are expressed as the mean ±S.E. of experiments from 3–5 animals or plates for each groups or time point. The difference between two experimental groups was analyzed using the Student's t test. Differences among multiple groups were analyzed using one way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni's post hoc. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. We initially determined the effect of LPS administration on the FXR mRNA levels in mouse liver at various times up to 24 h. As shown in Fig.1 A, LPS (100 μg) administration did not cause any significant change in the FXR mRNA level at 2 h. However, FXR mRNA decreased significantly by 8 h to ∼40% that of the control level, and the reduction persisted for 24 h. Next, we determined if FXR mRNA decreases in a dose-dependent manner in response to LPS administration. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the LPS-induced decrease in FXR mRNA was dose-dependent in mouse liver, with the half-maximal effect occurring at ∼0.5 μg/100 g of body weight. All doses tested in the experiment caused a significant reduction in FXR mRNA levels. Thus, LPS decreases FXR mRNA levels in the liver of mice at relatively low doses. Because hepatic expression of FXR is down-regulated by LPS administration in mouse liver, next we examined if FXR expression is altered in the intestine and the kidney, which also express FXR. As in the liver, LPS administration for 16 h caused a significant decrease (∼55%) in the level of FXR mRNA in the kidney (Fig.1 C). However, FXR mRNA was not reduced in the intestine (∼130%), suggesting that LPS causes tissue-specific responses in terms of FXR expression. These results indicate that LPS-induced APR reduces expression of FXR in mouse liver and kidney but not in the intestine. Nuclear hormone receptors exert their effect on transcriptional regulation by binding to their cognitive response element in the promoter region of target genes. To determine whether the reduction of FXR mRNA caused by LPS administration affects the DNA binding activity of FXR, we isolated nuclei from mouse liver and performed the electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay using a32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide containing FXR response element IR-1. As shown in Fig.2 A, two major FXR·IR1 complexes were observed in the control samples. LPS administration significantly decreased the binding of proteins in the nuclear extract from mouse liver to IR1 when compared with the control. LPS decreased FXR·IR1 binding by ∼75 and ∼50% for the upper and the lower band, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Competition with 100-fold molar excess of specific oligonucleotide (WT), but not with mutated oligonucleotide (Mut), abolished the complex formation of radiolabeled IR1 with FXR (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating the specificity of the two complexes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the complexes contain FXR and RXR. They were supershifted with anti-FXR (SS1, second lane) and anti-RXR (SS2, third lane) antibody (Fig.3). The migration of FXR·DNA complex was not affected by nonspecific IgG (fifth lane). To determine whether the decreased binding of FXR to DNA in hepatic nuclear extracts from LPS-treated mouse is associated with reduced transcription of FXR-regulated genes, we investigated the effect of LPS administration on the mRNA levels of SHP and apoCII, two of genes that are known to be regulated by FXR. SHP is a key mediator of the FXR effect on the transcriptional regulation of CYP7A1 gene, and SHP is induced by FXR activation. As shown in Fig.4, LPS administration decreases the expression of SHP by ∼70% and apoCII by 60% in mouse liver when compared with control. These data demonstrate that FXR-regulated genes are also repressed during LPS-induced APR in the mouse. It is well established that FXR down-regulates CYP7A1 expression as a feedback mechanism to maintain homeostasis of bile acid metabolism (26Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Google Scholar, 27Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Google Scholar). This is achieved by FXR-induced stimulation of SHP expression (26Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Google Scholar). SHP binds to and inactivates LRH, which is required for the transcriptional activation of CYP7A1 (26Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 517-526Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the above results showing a decrease in FXR and SHP, it is reasonable to expect an increase in the level of CYP7A1 during the APR. However, our previous studies demonstrated that the expression of Cyp7A1 is down-regulated during the APR induced by LPS administration in vivo (36Feingold K.R. Spady D.K. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 223-228Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the effect of LPS on the expression of LRH in mouse liver. As shown in Fig. 5, LPS administration for 16 h caused an ∼65% reduction in the LRH mRNA levels in mouse liver. This result suggests that the LPS-induced decrease in LRH may play a major role in determining the transcriptional regulation of CYP7A1. It is well known that the physiological effect of LPS is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1, and IL-6. To determine whether these cytokines also decrease FXR mRNAin vitro, as LPS does in mouse liver, human hepatoma cell line Hep3B cells were treated with cytokines at 10 ng/ml for 24 h, and RNA was isolated for Northern analysis. As shown in Fig.6, TNF treatment decreased FXR mRNA to less than 20% that of the control level. Also, IL-1 decreased FXR mRNA by 60%. However, IL-6 did not affect FXR expression in Hep3B cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the effect of LPS on FXR expression is mediated by TNF and IL-1. Because the inflammatory cytokine TNF causes a reduction in the FXR mRNA, we next determined if TNF also causes a similar change in the DNA binding activity of nuclear extracts from human hepatoma cells to an IR-1 FXR response element.

The 2.3-kb cDNA encodes an aldehyde dehydrogenase of 487 amino acid residues, about two-orders of magnitude more active in vitro with 9-cis-retinal than with all-trans-retinal. RALDH4 recognizes as substrate 9-cis-retinal generated in transfected cells by the short-chain dehydrogenases CRAD1, CRAD3, or RDH1, to reconstitute a path of 9-cis-retinoic acid biosynthesis in situ. Northern blot analysis showed expression of RALDH4 mRNA in adult mouse liver and kidney. In situ hybridization revealed expression of RALDH4 in liver on embryo day 14.5, in adult hepatocytes, and kidney cortex. Immunohistochemistry confirmed RALDH4 expression in hepatocytes and showed that hepatocytes also express RALDH1, RALDH2, and RALDH3. Kidney expresses the RALDH4 protein primarily in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules of the cortex but not in the glomeruli or the medulla. Kidney expresses RALDH2 in the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex but not in the distal convoluted tubules or glomeruli. Kidney expresses RALDH1 and RALDH2 in the medulla. The enzymatic characteristics of RALDH4, its expression in fetal liver, and its unique expression pattern in adult kidney compared with RALDH1, -2, and -3 suggest that it could meet specific needs for 9-cis-retinoic acid biosynthesis.

RXR forms heterodimers with numerous nuclear receptors, including RAR, vitamin D receptor (VDR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). The heterodimers seem to require only the non-RXR ligands for maximum activation, if present in sufficient concentrations. Nevertheless, 9cRA increases heterodimer activation in vitro when non-RXR ligand concentrations fall below maximum. 9cRA and its analogues may affect disease progression, including noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and specific cancers (9Nagpal S. Chandraratna R.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 919-931Google Scholar, 10Altucci L. Gronemeyer H. Nature Reviews. 2001; 1: 181-193Google Scholar). If endogenous 9cRA has important functionsin vivo, its biosynthesis likely would be controlled. Understanding control would require detailed knowledge of the enzymes that catalyze 9cRA biosynthesis and their expression loci. RA biosynthesis from retinol proceeds via two reactions with retinal as an intermediate (11Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Google Scholar). Only one mouse SDR, RDH1, functions efficiently with all-trans-retinol, but at least three mouse SDR, RDH1, CRAD1, and CRAD3, function efficiently with 9-cis-retinol (12Napoli J.L. Mol. Cell.

Four different RALDH have been identified that convert all-trans- or 9-cis-retinal into RA. All belong to the ALDH superfamily, which consists of at least 86 eukaryotic members (16Sophos N.A.

A fourth candidate, the human ALDH12 (not the same enzyme as Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, which also has been designated ALDH12/ALDH8A1 (29Hu C. Lin W.-W. Cassandra O. Valle D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40106-40112Google Scholar). It is the only known ALDH more efficient for 9-cis-retinal than for all-trans-retinal. Here, we report cDNA cloning and characterization of a new mouse ALDH, RALDH4, and its mRNA and protein expression patterns in the adult and embryo. We reconstituted 9cRA biosynthesis in intact cells to compare the activity of mRALDH4 to the other two mouse RALDH (RALDH1 and RALDH2) that recognize 9-cis-retinal and to assess ability of the three RALDH to generate 9cRA from 9-cis-retinal produced in intact cells by the retinol dehydrogenases mCRAD1, mCRAD3, and mRDH1. We found that RALDH4 functions in intact cells to generate 9cRA when co-expressed with CRAD1, CRAD2, or RDH1 and has a unique expression pattern in kidney compared with the other RALDH. The expressed sequence tag clone AI504872 (ATCC, IMAGE 987012) in GenBankTMshows significant homology with human ALDH12 (31Lin M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40106-40112Google Scholar). We sequenced the entire insert and generated the complete 3′-untranslated region with two rounds of RACE using mouse e17 Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech). First-round PCR was done with a program of 3 min/94 °C, 30 s/94 °C, 30 s/55 °C, and 90 s/72 °C for 35 cycles and finally 72 °C/10 min. Nested PCR was done using the same program except with 25 cycles. The gene-specific primers for the two rounds of RACE-PCR were 5′-TGTCAGTGCAGTCAACAGAG-3′ (nt 1561–1580) and 5′-CTCAATGACCACTGACGGTA-3′ (nt 1628–1647) of the final cDNA. An additional 5′-untranslated region sequence was amplified by 5′-RACE using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) and mouse liver poly(A+) RNA (Clontech) with the primer 5′-AGAGACTGCTCCAGTACATC-3′ (nt 282–301 of the final cDNA), following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR products were cloned into pGEN-T (Promega) for sequencing. Mouse multiple tissue and embryo Northern blots were purchased from Clontech. A 304-base pair probe corresponding to nt 1343–1646 of the cDNA sequence was amplified by PCR, labeled with 32P using the RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen), and hybridized according to the manufacturer's protocol. Prehybridization and hybridization were done in 10 ml of ExpressHyb (Clontech) solution at 68 °C for 30 min and 1 h, respectively. The blot was washed four times in 2× SSC with 0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 min, followed by two washes in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 30 min. We stripped the RALDH4 probe and reprobed the blot with a β-actin probe (Clontech) using the same protocol. Blots were exposed to Kodak X-OMAT LS film overnight. The coding region of mRALDH4 was amplified with primers (restriction sites are underlined), 5′-CGGGATCCGGCACTTTCCTAACATGGCT-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCCACAGCAGCTGTAGGATGAT-3′, and was cloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to create pcDNA3/mRALDH4. pcDNA3/mRALDH4 was transfected into CHO-K1 cells with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). Cells transfected with pcDNA3 were used as control. 24 h after transfection, cells were sonicated in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mmKCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 2 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The 800 × g supernatants (10-min spins) were the source of protein for enzyme assays done at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm NAD+. Retinoids were added in 2 μl of Me2SO. RA was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (29Hu C. Lin W.-W. Cassandra O. Valle D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6754-6762Google Scholar). The day before transfection with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), CHO-K1 cells were seeded into 6-well plates. 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium (1 ml/well) containing 1 μm9-cis-retinol. After 1 h of incubation, cells and medium were extracted to quantify 9cRA. The same probe used for Northern blot hybridization was cloned into pGEM-T. The direction of insertion was determined by DNA sequencing. The construct was digested withSpeI and transcribed from the T7 promoter to generate the antisense probe or was digested with SacII and transcribed from the SP6 promoter to generate the sense probe. Adult liver and kidney samples were harvested from 4-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory). NIH Swiss mouse embryos were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). The morning of plug detection was designated e0.5. In situ hybridization was done on paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using35S-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes as described (28Grun F. Hirose Y. Kawauchi S. Ogura T. Umesono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41210-41218Google Scholar, 32Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Tissue sections were counterstained with propidium iodide after development. Images were obtained under dark-field and epifluorescent illumination. Rabbit antibodies were raised against peptides designed from mouse RALDH4 (residues 406–419, DSEEEVITRANSVR), RALDH1 (residues 434–455, TKDLDKAITVSS), RALDH2 (residues 482–493, REYSEVKTVTVK), and RALDH3 (residues 446–459, KNLDKALKLAAALE). Each was purified by affinity chromatography using peptide coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated-Sepharose 4 (AmershamBiosciences). For Western blot analyses, ∼5 μg of protein from CHO cell lysates were run on 10% SDS-PAGE. The samples were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot S.D. semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk. The membrane was then incubated with 0.1 μg/μl primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Immunohistochemistry was done with the rabbit ABC staining system following the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Adult mouse tissue sections were obtained from Histo-Tec Laboratory (Hayward, CA). Slides were de-paraffined using Citrisolv (Fisher) and rehydrated with serial dilutions of aqueous ethanol. Antigens were unmasked by a 10-min treatment with 0.1% pepsin in HCl buffer, pH 2.5. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by a 10-min incubation with 1% H2O2. Slides were incubated with 1.5% blocking serum at room temperature for 1 h, then with 0.5 μg/μl primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature or 4 °C overnight, and finally with biotinylated secondary antibody at room temperature for 30 min. Signals were detected by incubation with biotinylated horse radish peroxidase together with avidin and were stained with peroxidase substrate. Negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibody. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Amplification by RACE of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the expressed sequence tag clone IMAGE 987012 produced a cDNA of 2.3 kb that included 50 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start site, continued through the polyadenylation signal, and concluded with 22 adenosine residues (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence showed high identify with a human RALDH (90%) and with the partial sequence of a rat RALDH (91%) and contained all 23 invariant residues of the ALDH superfamily (Fig.1). The mouse ALDH, designated RALDH4, shows no more than 50% amino acid sequence similarity with mouse RALDH1, -2, and -3 (Table I) (19Lee M.O. Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab GenBank™ accession numbers are provided in parentheses. Initial assays were done with 10 μm substrate and the 800 × g supernatant of transfected CHO cells. mRALDH4 had high enzymatic activity with 9-cis-retinal (2.5 ± 0.2 nmol/min/mg protein; means ± S.D., n = 3), lower activity with 13-cis-retinal (0.6 ± 0.06), and very low activity with all-trans-retinal (0.03 ± 0.002). Kinetic constants were determined in two independent assays under initial velocity conditions with the most efficient substrate, 9-cis-retinal. The average K m value was 2.3 ± 0.3 μm (± S.E.) and the averageV max value was 3.4 ± 0.1 nmol/min/mg (Fig.2, top). Disulfiram and citral inhibited mRALDH4 activity with IC50 values of 5.3 and 31 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, bottom). Acetaldehyde inhibited weakly (IC50 value = 9.6 mm). mRALDH4 functioned in reconstituted paths of 9cRA biosynthesis in intact cells, with 9-cis-retinal generated in situ by mCRAD1, mCRAD3, or mRDH1 (Fig.3). CRAD1 and CRAD3 were about equivalent in generating 9-cis-retinal, as predicted by their kinetic constants (13Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Google Scholar, 14Zhuang R. Lin M. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3477-3483Google Scholar), whereas RDH1 was less efficient, consistent with its greater efficiency with all-trans-retinol than 9-cis-retinol (15Zhang M. Chen W. Smith S.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44083-44090Google Scholar). RALDH4 was less efficient than RALDH1 or RALDH2 in generating 9cRA from 9-cis-retinal produced by CRAD1. Western blots showed that differences in protein expression did not contribute markedly to the differences in activities. Northern blot showed intense expression of mRALDH4 mRNA in liver and kidney (Fig.4). No signals were detected in six other tissues screened. Northern blot also showed expression at e15 and e17 but no signal at e7 or e11, indicating initiation of RALDH4 expression after e11 and on or before e15. No mRALDH4 mRNA signal was detected in the e10.5 embryo, consistent with the Northern blot data (Fig.5). At e14.5, expression was detected in liver but not in kidney or elsewhere except for low but consistent signals in some blood cell populations (data not shown). In the 4-week-old male mouse, RALDH4 mRNA was expressed throughout the liver and intensely in the kidney cortex (Fig.6).Figure 6In situ hybridization of RALDH4 in adult mouse liver and kidney. Hybridization signals are represented by silver grains; nuclei were visualized with propidium iodide. A, antisense cRNA reveals robust RALDH4 transcript levels throughout liver.

Magnification is 4× in all panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether the anti-peptide antibodies were specific, Western blot analyses were done with lysates of CHO cells transfected with each RALDH construct. Each RALDH was detected as a ∼54-kDa band, and each antibody reacted specifically with its corresponding enzyme (Fig.7). Immunohistochemical staining of adult mouse liver sections showed that many but not all hepatocytes throughout the liver express the four RALDH (Fig. 8). No pattern emerged for RALDH expression in any particular liver section. Frequent signals for RALDH1 were detected in cells with lipid droplets (Fig. 8, panel 1, arrow). Signals for RALDH2 and 3 were much less frequent in cells with lipid droplets, and signals for RALDH4 did appear in cells with lipid droplets. The epithelial cells of the bile ducts and the endothelial cells of blood vessels showed no specific signal for any of the four enzymes. Negative controls (no primary antibody) showed no staining (Fig. 8 C). Immunohistochemistry showed that kidney expresses RALDH4 primarily in the cortex in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, overlapping with its mRNA expression (Fig.9 A). RALDH4 was not detected in glomeruli (Fig. 9, B and C). RALDH1 produced weak signals close to background in the cortex (Fig. 9 D) but showed strong signals in the medulla, localized to the straight segments of loops of Henle (Fig. 9 F), collecting tubules (Fig. 9 G), and thin segments of loops of Henle (Fig.9 H). RALDH2 was detected in the cortex in proximal convoluted tubules but not in distal convoluted tubules or glomeruli (Fig. 9 E). RALDH2 also was detected in the medulla in collecting tubules (Fig. 9 I) and straight segments of loops of Henle (Fig. 9 J). Negative controls (no primary antibody) showed no signals (Fig. 9 K). No RALDH3 signals were detected in kidney. This report shows that a fourth mouse ALDH, RALDH4, recognizes retinoids as substrates. Mouse RALDH4 likely represents an ortholog of human ALDH12 3The standardized ALDH nomenclature approved by HUGO has named 17 human ALDH genes, but the human ALDH with 9-cis-retinal dehydrogenase activity reported in Ref. 31Lin M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40106-40112Google Scholar as ALDH12 was not among them. The trivial name ALDH12 has been assigned to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylase (16Sophos N.A. Pappa A. Ziegler T.L. Vasiliou V. Chem.-Biol. Inter. 2001; 130–132: 323-337Google Scholar). because the two share 90% amino acid identity, have similar K mvalues for 9-cis-retinal (3.2 μm for ALDH12), do not catalyze all-trans-retinal dehydrogenation well, and are expressed intensely in the adult only in liver and kidney (31Lin M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40106-40112Google Scholar). Characterization of mouse RALDH4 extends insight into retinoid metabolism by demonstrating its generation of 9cRA in intact cells in cooperation with any one of three mouse SDR (CRAD1, CRAD3, RDH1) and by showing that its mRNA and protein expression patterns differ from the other RALDH. In contrast to RALDH4, the e14.5 mouse liver expresses RALDH1 mRNA weakly and does not express RALDH2 or RALDH3 mRNA (33Niederreither K. McCaffery P. Dräger U.C. Chambon P. Dollé P. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 67-78Google Scholar, 34Niederreither K. Fraulab V. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Dollé P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 165-171Google Scholar). This early intense expression of RALDH4 in fetal liver suggests a function in fetal liver development. Expression of RALDH4 in liver and some blood cells at e14.5 suggests a potential contribution to fetal hemopoiesis. This is significant because mouse embryos that lack RXRα have decreased erythropoietin expression and impaired erythropoiesis between e10.25 and e14.5 (35Makita T. Hernandez-Hoyos G. Chen T.H-P. Wu H. Rothenberg E.V. Sucov H.M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 889-901Google Scholar). These observations may provide insight into the mechanism for the synergistic effects of vitamin A and iron supplementation on erythropoiesis and relief of nutritional anemia relative to iron supplementation alone (36Suharno D. West C.E. Muhilal K.D. Jautvast J.G. Lancet. 1993; 342: 1325-1328Google Scholar). RALDH1 accounts for at least 90% of the all-trans-retinal and 9-cis-retinal dehydrogenase activities in adult rat/mouse liver and kidney (18Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Yanagawa Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 37-44Google Scholar, 19Lee M.O. Manthey C.L. Sladek N.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1279-1285Google Scholar, 24El Akawi Z. Napoli J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1938-1943Google Scholar). RALDH2, -3, and -4 contribute the remaining activity, without apparent domination by any one. Multiple RALDH expressed in hepatocytes, albeit not necessarily in the same hepatocytes, may allow differential regulation or may reflect the status of the cell cycle or differentiation state. Distinctive functions for each isozyme are suggested by the observation that adult mouse kidney cortex expresses RALDH2 and -4, whereas the medulla expresses RALDH1 and -2. Adult mouse kidney expresses RDH1 protein in both the cortex and medulla, which could provide 9-cis-retinal for 9cRA production by RALDH. 4Na Bien-Ly and J. L. Napoli, unpublished data. The lack of a protein signal for RALDH3 in kidney contrasts with detection of RALDH3 mRNA in the collecting ducts of the renal papilla in fetal and adult mouse (34Niederreither K. Fraulab V. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Dollé P. Mech. Dev. 2002; 110: 165-171Google Scholar). It is not clear whether this reflects a technical problem or weak translation of RALDH3 mRNA and/or rapid turnover of RALDH3 protein in adult kidney. Citral inhibits retinal metabolism catalyzed by rat RALDH1 and -2 and chick RALDH3 with IC50 values of 1, 12, and 3.5 μm, respectively, compared with the IC50value of 25 μm with mRALDH4 (20Posch K.C. Burns R.D. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19676-19682Google Scholar, 23Bhat P.V. Labrecque J. Boutin J.M. Lacroix A. Yoshida A. Gene. 1995; 166: 303-306Google Scholar, 28Grun F. Hirose Y. Kawauchi S. Ogura T. Umesono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41210-41218Google Scholar). Areas affected morphologically by citral have been considered loci of RA biosynthesis and signaling, even though no data indicates that citral inhibits RALDH and/or any ALDH specifically. The aldehyde functional group of citral could impair actions of many proteins through Schiff's-base formation unrelated to active site binding. Acetaldehyde inhibition of all RALDH suggests potential impairment of RA generation through two mechanisms, competition at active sites and acetylation of lysine residues. In summary, this study describes cDNA cloning and characterization of mouse RALDH4, an enzyme active with endogenously generated 9-cis-retinal in intact cells. RALDH4 has different expression during embryonic development and in the adult kidney compared with three other mouse RALDH. RALDH4 can function with any one of CRAD1, CRAD3, or RDH1 to reconstitute a path of 9cRA biosynthesis in cells. These data are consistent with a distinct contribution of RALDH4 to retinoid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2062008821,"Base excision repair of oxidized pyrimidines in human DNA is initiated by the DNAN-glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase, human NTH1 (hNTH1), the homolog of Escherichia coliendonuclease III (Nth). In contrast to Nth, the DNAN-glycosylase activity of hNTH1 is 7-fold greater than its AP lyase activity when the DNA substrate contains a thymine glycol (Tg) opposite adenine (Tg:A) (Marenstein, D. R., Ocampo, M. T. A., Chan, M. K., Altamirano, A., Basu, A. K., Boorstein, R. J., Cunningham, R. P., and Teebor, G. W. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 21242–21249). When Tg is opposite guanine (Tg:G), the two activities are of the same specific activity as the AP lyase activity of hNTH1 against Tg:A (Ocampo, M. T. A., Chaung, W., Marenstein, D. R., Chan, M. K., Altamirano, A., Basu, A. K., Boorstein, R. J., Cunningham, R. P., and Teebor, G. W. (2002) Mol. Cell. Biol. 22, 6111–6121). We demonstrate here that hNTH1 was inhibited by the product of its DNA N-glycosylase activity directed against Tg:G, the AP:G site. In contrast, hNTH1 was not as inhibited by the AP:A site arising from release of Tg from Tg:A. Addition of human APE1 (APendonuclease-1) increased dissociation of hNTH1 from the DNA N-glycosylase-generated AP:A site, resulting in abrogation of AP lyase activity and an increase in turnover of the DNA N-glycosylase activity of hNTH1. Addition of APE1 did not abrogate hNTH1 AP lyase activity against Tg:G. The stimulatory protein YB-1 (Marenstein et al.), added to APE1, resulted in an additive increase in both activities of hNTH1 regardless of base pairing. Tg:A is formed by oxidative attack on thymine opposite adenine. Tg:G is formed by oxidative attack on 5-methylcytosine opposite guanine (Zuo, S., Boorstein, R. J., and Teebor, G. W. (1995) Nucleic Acids Res. 23, 3239–3243). It is possible that the in vitro substrate selectivity of mammalian NTH1 and the concomitant selective stimulation of activity by APE1 are indicative of selective repair of oxidative damage in different regions of the genome. Base excision repair of oxidized pyrimidines in human DNA is initiated by the DNAN-glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase, human NTH1 (hNTH1), the homolog of Escherichia coliendonuclease III (Nth). In contrast to Nth, the DNAN-glycosylase activity of hNTH1 is 7-fold greater than its AP lyase activity when the DNA substrate contains a thymine glycol (Tg) opposite adenine (Tg:A) (Marenstein, D.

It is possible that the in vitro substrate selectivity of mammalian NTH1 and the concomitant selective stimulation of activity by APE1 are indicative of selective repair of oxidative damage in different regions of the genome. Like its Escherichia coli homolog, endonuclease III (Nth), hNTH1 1The abbreviations used are: hNTH1, human NTH1; AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; BER, base excision repair; Tg, thymine glycol; hOGG1, human OGG1 is a bifunctional DNA N-glycosylase/apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase that removes ring-saturated pyrimidines, be they hydrated, reduced, or oxidized, from the DNA backbone as the initial step of base excision repair (BER) of such modified residues (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar). The oxidation product of thymine, 5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymine (thymine glycol (Tg)) is a widely studied model substrate for hNTH1 and catalyzes its release from DNA via its DNA N-glycosylase activity. This enzyme activity is mediated via formation of a transient Schiff base (imino) enzyme-DNA intermediate, an example of covalent catalysis and a characteristic of all known bifunctional DNAN-glycosylases/AP lyases (4O'Handley S. Scholes C.P. Cunningham R.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2528-2536Google Scholar, 5McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Google Scholar). The Schiff base moiety has been hypothesized to be required for the enzymatic catalysis of the β-elimination reaction, which effects DNA strand cleavage 3′ to the abasic (AP) site formed as a product of the release of the base from the 2′-deoxyribose moiety to which it was linked. The hydrolysis of the Schiff base intermediate can occur in the absence of or following enzyme-catalyzed β-elimination (AP lyase activity), resulting in DNA strand cleavage. The enzymatic catalysis of β-elimination by DNA N-glycosylases/AP lyases has been shown to be initiated via abstraction of the deoxyribose pro-S-2′-hydrogen by a basic amino acid in the enzyme active site. Several factors, including pH, can affect the efficiency of the AP lyase step by affecting substrate binding and proton abstraction (5McCullough A.K. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 255-285Google Scholar). Based on the results of studies with Nth, the two activities of hNTH1 (DNA N-glycosylase and β-elimination catalysis) require the formation of the Schiff base intermediate and were thought to occur concomitantly. However, data from our laboratory (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar) and from other laboratories (6Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Google Scholar, 7Vidal A.E. Dickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar, 8Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Google Scholar) indicate that DNA N-glycosylase and β-elimination catalysis by mammalian members of the endonuclease III enzyme superfamily are not concurrent under the assay conditions employed. We were the first to report that the DNAN-glycosylase and AP lyase activities of hNTH1 are not concurrent, i.e. that the rate of AP lyase-mediated strand cleavage is much slower than the rate of DNAN-glycosylase-mediated base release. These results are similar to the non-concurrence of base release and strand cleavage reported for the mammalian 8-oxoguanine-DNAN-glycosylase homolog OGG1 (8Zharkov D.O. Rosenquist T.A. Gerchman S.E. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28607-28617Google Scholar). In this report, we present data demonstrating that the dissociation of the two activities of hNTH1 is dependent on the nature of the orphan base opposite the Tg residue in DNA. In our studies of the properties of hNTH1, we have focused our attention on protein modulators of hNTH1 activities. This approach resulted from our original observation that the enzyme properties of mammalian endonuclease III homologs are strikingly different from those of bacterial endonuclease III. Our laboratory was the first to identify mammalian endonuclease III homologs and to describe their distinct kinetic properties (9Hilbert T.P. Boorstein R.J. Kung H.C. Bolton P.H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2505-2511Google Scholar, 10Hilbert T.P. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6733-6740Google Scholar). These observations spurred us to isolate novel proteins that might modulate the enzyme activities of mammalian NTH1. A yeast two-hybrid search resulted in identification of the pluripotent transcription factor YB-1 (Y-box-binding protein-1; also known as DNA-binding protein B) as a stimulator of hNTH1 activity (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar). We now report additional aspects of the proteomics of hNTH1-initiated BER based on the effects of human APE1 (APendonuclease-1; HAP1/REF1/APE) on hNTH1 activity. APE1, a human homolog of E. coli exonuclease III (Xth), catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond 5′ to AP sites, generating a free 3′-hydroxyl end for the initiation of DNA polymerase repair synthesis. APE1 has recently been demonstrated to play a significant role in the coordination of BER. APE1 has been shown to modulate the activities of several major DNA N-glycosylases, although physical interaction between APE1 and most of these DNAN-glycosylases has not been demonstrated (6Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Google Scholar, 7Vidal A.E. Dickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar, 11Yang H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Google Scholar). The functional interaction between APE1 and DNA N-glycosylases is consistent with the model of the coordinated activities of BER enzymes at sites of DNA damage (13Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Google Scholar, 14Kavli B. Sundheim O. Akbari M. Otterlei M. Nilsen H. Skorpen F. Aas P.A. Hagen L. Krokan H.E. Slupphaug G. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 480–481: 277-284Google Scholar). Two groups independently demonstrated the stimulation of human OGG1 (hOGG1) by APE1 (6Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Google Scholar, 7Vidal A.E. Dickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Google Scholar). Both groups demonstrated that APE1 replaces hOGG1 bound to the AP site following base release and prior to hOGG1-catalyzed β-elimination. This resulted in bypass of the AP lyase step and an increase in hOGG1 turnover. In this study, we report similar findings with hNTH1 and APE1. However, stimulation by APE1 proved to be dependent on the nature of the orphan base opposite the Tg residue in DNA. Expression and purification of recombinant hNTH1 were induced as described previously (10Hilbert T.P. Chaung W. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6733-6740Google Scholar). hNTH1 concentration was quantified using an extinction coefficient of 1 absorbance unit at A 410 of 69.4 μm for the C-terminal cubane 4[Fe-S] cluster (17Cunningham R.P.

YB-1 was expressed with a His6 tag in Trichoplusia ni cells and purified as described (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J.

The 30-mer 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide substrate containing a uracil residue at position 13 of the identical sequence and the complementary 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Department of Cell Biology of the New York University School of Medicine. 2′-Deoxyribose oligonucleotides were deblocked, deprotected, and purified by 20% denaturing PAGE. The 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotides were gel-purified and labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) or at the 3′-end using [α-32P]ddATP (Amersham Biosciences) and terminal transferase (New England Biolabs Inc.). All labeled nucleotides were purified by Sephadex G-25 spin column filtration (AmershamBiosciences) and annealed to the complementary strand, which contained an adenine or guanine base opposite the Tg or uracil residue. Unless otherwise indicated, assays were performed at 37 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Enzyme, protein, and substrate were diluted to working conditions in assay buffer and equilibrated at 37 °C. MgCl2-independent assays were performed with the above reaction buffer minus MgCl2 in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, which permits binding of APE1 to DNA, but inhibits its endonuclease activity (18Mckenzie J.A. Strauss P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13254-13261Google Scholar). Reactions contained 40 nm32P-5′-end-labeled 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrate and 5 nm hNTH1 with or without 20 nm APE1. Two sets of 10-μl aliquots were taken at the indicated time periods and snap-frozen in ethanol and dry ice, after which one set was treated with 5 μl of 0.5 m putrescine (pH 8.0) to measure base release. The treated assay mixtures were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by addition of 15 μl of loading dye (95% deionized formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). To measure strand cleavage, samples were treated with an equal volume of loading dye. All samples were then heated at 55 °C for 5 min, and products were separated by 20% PAGE in 7 m urea and 1× Tris borate/EDTA. Low substrate concentration assays were performed with 20 nmhNTH1 and 20 nm32P-5′-end-labeled 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrate. At the indicated times, aliquots were taken and treated as described above. Multiple-turnover assays at V max were performed individually in 10-μl volumes containing reaction buffer, the indicated concentration of 32P-5′-end-labeled 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrate, and 20 nmhNTH1 with or without 100 nm YB-1 and/or 100 nmAPE1. The reactions were split into two 5-μl aliquots, snap-frozen in ethanol and dry ice, and treated as described above. To discriminate between endonucleolytic and AP lyase products, reactions were performed using 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrate labeled at the 3′-end with [α-32P]ddAMP. Reactions contained the indicated substrate and enzyme concentrations and were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. NaBH4 was added to 100 mm, and the reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min for reduction of the 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate moiety (19Ischenko A.A. Saparbaev M.K. Nature. 2002; 415: 183-187Google Scholar). The products were purified by Sephadex G-25 spin column filtration prior to separation and analysis. Single-turnover assays contained 10 nm 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex labeled at the 3′-end with [α-32P]ddAMP and 100 nm hNTH1 with or without 100 nm APE1 in a volume of 220 μl. Enzyme reaction mixtures were incubated together for 2 min prior to initiation of the assay upon addition of substrate. To measure base release, 5-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated time periods, snap-frozen, and treated with 5 μl of 0.5 m putrescine (pH 8.0). The treated assay mixtures were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by addition of 10 μl of loading dye. To measure strand cleavage and to determine incision products, 5-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated time periods, snap-frozen, and treated with an equal volume of 0.5 m NaBH4 at 37 °C for 20 min for reduction of the 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate moiety. Samples were then filtered through a Sephadex G-25 spin column, treated with an equal volume of loading dye, and heated at 55 °C for 5 min, and products were separated by 20% PAGE in 7 m urea and 1× Tris borate/EDTA. All products were analyzed quantitatively via phosphorimaging using a Molecular Imager FX system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For NaBH4 reduction, assays contained the indicated 32P-5′-end-labeled 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex (400 nm) and 20 nm hNTH1 with or without 100 nm APE1 and/or 100 nm YB-1 in a volume of 10 μl. After a 15-min incubation, reaction mixtures were treated with 5 μl of 0.5 mNaBH4 and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. After addition of an equal volume of Laemmli SDS loading buffer, samples were boiled in preparation for separation and analysis. All samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed quantitatively via phosphorimaging as described above. We previously demonstrated, using a Tg:A-containing substrate, that the initial rate of DNAN-glycosylase-mediated release of Tg by hNTH1 is much greater than the rate of AP lyase-mediated DNA strand cleavage (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar). Because all previous assays with Tg have been done with adenine as the opposite base and because this may not be the only context in which Tg occurs in vivo, we decided to look at hNTH1 activity against substrates containing Tg paired opposite guanine (2Ocampo M.T.A. Chaung W. Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6111-6121Google Scholar). Fig.1 is confirmation of our previous data. The assay was carried out in a shorter reaction period than we previously used and revealed that the difference between the rate of base release and strand cleavage of a Tg:A substrate is even greater than we had reported, differing by an order of magnitude. In sharp contrast, the AP lyase activity of hNTH1 was the same as its DNAN-glycosylase activity against a Tg:G substrate. The DNAN-glycosylase activity of the enzyme against Tg:A appeared to reach V max at substrate concentrations >400 nm. However, as we previously reported, hNTH1 does not follow Michaelis-Menten pseudo zero-order kinetics (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar). Instead, the apparent k cat (which includes the product release rates) increased with increasing hNTH1 concentrations, suggesting positive cooperativity in hNTH1 substrate processing. This observation and interpretation have been corroborated and expanded upon by Liu and Roy (20Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Google Scholar). Because of this phenomenon,k cat and K m values for the 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrates vary with enzyme concentration. As we previously suggested, the V versus S data of Fig. 1 reflect the fact that the enzyme was dissociating from the DNA N-glycosylase-generated AP:A site and initiating base release on new Tg:A substrates without catalyzing β-elimination (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar). However, when the substrate was Tg:G, there was no evidence of enzyme dissociation from AP:G (2Ocampo M.T.A. Chaung W. Marenstein D.R. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6111-6121Google Scholar). We looked at the effect of APE1 on the activities of hNTH1. There is evidence that APE1 interacts with DNAN-glycosylases in BER as part of a “single-nucleotide BER relay” involved in the coordination of processing of BER pathway intermediates (13Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Google Scholar, 21Mol D.C. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Google Scholar, 22Ranalli T.A. Tom S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41715-41724Google Scholar, 23Srivastava D.K. Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that addition of APE1 increased hNTH1 activity against a Tg:A substrate. The stimulation of hNTH1 activity was independent of the enzyme activity of APE1. The assay mixture lacked MgCl2 and contained sufficient EDTA to abrogate APE1-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage, but not the binding of APE1 to DNA (18Mckenzie J.A. Strauss P.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13254-13261Google Scholar). Identical experiments with Tg:G substrates showed no increase in hNTH1 substrate processing in the presence of APE1 (data not shown). We found that the optimum ratio for stimulation of hNTH1 by APE1 varied with both hNTH1 and substrate concentrations, ranging from 1:1 to 1:10. We suggest that this variability was due, at least in part, to the positive cooperativity exhibited by hNTH1 (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar, 20Liu X. Roy R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 265-276Google Scholar). Having determined that the effect of APE1 on hNTH1 activity differed with substrate, we characterized the incision products generated by APE1 and hNTH1 with the two substrates. The incision products generated by hNTH1 in the presence of APE1 in vitro differed with each substrate. Fig. 3 is the gel analysis of the incision products of 32P-3′-end-labeled Tg:A- and Tg:G-containing 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrates generated by hNTH1 in the presence or absence of APE1. In contrast to the experiments shown in Fig. 2, MgCl2 was added to the reaction to activate the endonucleolytic activity of APE1. The 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate residue generated by APE1-catalyzed endonucleolytic cleavage of an AP site is extremely labile and not retained during electrophoresis. Reduction by NaBH4 prior to electrophoresis stabilizes the sugar moiety and permits size discrimination between 5′-endonucleolytic and 3′-β-elimination AP lyase products (19Ischenko A.A. Saparbaev M.K. Nature. 2002; 415: 183-187Google Scholar). The AP lyase product (p-17-p*ddA) can be seen in lanes containing hNTH1 with either the Tg:A or Tg:G substrate (lanes 2 and 4, respectively). Addition of APE1 to hNTH1 using Tg:A produced a higher molecular weight incision product, which was the endonucleolytic product (p-rAP-p-17-p*ddA, where rAP is reduced apurinic/apyrimidinic) generated by APE1 (lane 3). In the case of the Tg:G substrate, no change in the size of the incision product was detected upon APE1 addition, indicating that the AP lyase activity of hNTH1 was unaffected by APE1 with this substrate (lane 5). In Fig. 3, there are two marker lanes for the β-elimination product, one with the Tg:G-containing substrate and one with the U:A-containing substrate (lanes 6 and 8, respectively). Formamidopyrimidine-DNA N-glycosylase has β/δ-elimination activity. Because the substrate was 3′-labeled, the only product observed with formamidopyrimidine-DNAN-glycosylase was the β-elimination product (lane 6). A second marker lane for the β-elimination product is the AP site-containing substrate generated by incubation of the U:A-containing substrate with uracil-DNA N-glycosylase and hNTH1 to generate the AP lyase product (p-17-p*ddA) (lane 8). The U:A-containing substrate incubated with uracil-DNAN-glycosylase and APE1 serves as the marker for the endonucleolytic product (p-rAP-p-17-p*ddA) (lane 7). Because our previous work identified YB-1 as a modifier of hNTH1 activity (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham R.P. Teebor G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21242-21249Google Scholar), we next investigated whether addition of YB-1 together with APE1 had any effect on the nature of the incision products of hNTH1 with Tg:A-containing 2′-deoxyribose oligonucleotide duplex substrate labeled at the 3′-end with [32P]ddAMP (Fig.4). Addition of YB-1 in the presence or absence of APE1 increased product formation (lanes 2 and4). However, it did not change the nature of the incision product, which, in the presence of APE1, was the endonucleolytic product (p-rAP-p-17-p*ddA) (lanes 3 and4). Because hNTH1 did not demonstrate AP lyase activity against Tg:A sites in the presence of APE1, we investigated whether the removal of the 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate residue could be effected by DNA polymerase β. Fig. 4 demonstrates the reappearance of the β-elimination product upon addition of DNA polymerase β to hNTH1 and APE1 with a Tg:A substrate (lane 7). This observation is consistent with the known 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphatase activity of DNA polymerase β (22Ranalli T.A. Tom S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41715-41724Google Scholar). The marker lane for the β-elimination product (p-17-p*ddA) contains formamidopyrimidine-DNAN-glycosylase (lane 9). Similar experiments with an N-terminal deletion mutant of hNTH1 lacking amino acids 1–57 produced the same results in the presence of APE1 and YB-1 (data not shown), suggesting that the effects of YB-1 and APE1 are not mediated by the N terminus of hNTH1. To elucidate the mechanism by which APE1 affects hNTH1 activity, we investigated whether APE1 changed the catalytic properties of hNTH1 or whether it affected product inhibition. To address this, we conducted the reaction under single-turnover conditions in which [E] ≫ [S] using substrates labeled at the 3′-end with [32P]ddAMP to determine the nature of the incision product. Because all substrate molecules are bound by enzyme under single-turnover conditions, the rates that determine product formation are dependent only on the rate of base release (Schiff base formation) and β-elimination (24Porello S.L. Leyes A.E. David S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14756-14764Google Scholar). If APE1 did not affect either of these catalytic properties, then there should be no stimulation under conditions of single turnover. Fig. 5 illustrates that no stimulatory effect of DNA N-glycosylase activity was observed under conditions in which neither enzyme turnover nor substrate binding contributed significantly to the rate of the reaction. A complete abrogation of the AP lyase-mediated AP site cleavage was seen with the Tg:A substrate (Fig. 5 A). This is consistent with the results of Figs. 3 and 4 (lanes 3). Interestingly, in the case of the Tg:G substrate, addition of APE1 increased the rate of hNTH1 AP lyase activity (Fig. 5 B). We previously mentioned that addition of APE1 did not result in increased product formation by hNTH1 under turnover conditions using Tg:G (see above). Thus, the results of Fig. 5 B suggest that hNTH1 remained tightly bound to the nicked AP:G DNA, which is the product of AP lyase activity. With both Tg:A and Tg:G substrates, the binding to the substrate and base release were rapid, whereas β-elimination-catalyzed cleavage of the resulting AP site was clearly the rate-limiting reaction. Under single-turnover conditions, the lag of the AP lyase step behind the DNAN-glycosylase step was only slightly longer for Tg:A than for Tg:G, indicating that the difference in processing of the two substrates was due to enzyme turnover determined by the relative rates of dissociation of hNTH1 from its products (Fig. 5). Further evidence for this is shown in Fig. 6, in which both hNTH1 and Tg:A and Tg:G substrates were present at low equimolar concentrations. Under these conditions, the dissociation of the DNAN-glycosylase and AP lyase activities of hNTH1 was apparent against the Tg:A substrate, but there was no dissociation between the two activities against the Tg:G substrate. To determine whether APE1 increased the maximal rate of turnover for the enzyme, we tested stimulation by APE1 under conditions of V max for both DNAN-glycosylase and AP lyase activities using 20 nm hNTH1 and 400 nm Tg:A substrate, identical to the conditions of Fig. 1. However, in the experiments of Fig.7, MgCl2 was added to activate APE1 endonucleolytic activity. In reactions containing hNTH1 alone or with YB-1, DNA cleavage was due solely to hNTH1-catalyzed β-elimination. For all four sets of experiments, DNAN-glycosylase activity was quantified by measuring the cleavage of hNTH1-generated AP sites by treatment with organic base (putrescine), which effects cleavage via β-elimination (25Mazumder A. Gerlt J.A. Absalon M.J. Stubbe J. Cunningham R.P. Withka J. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1119-1126Google Scholar). In reactions containing APE1, all cleavages were the result of APE1 activity. Addition of APE1 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the number of hNTH1-generated AP sites compared with hNTH1 alone. Addition of YB-1 also caused a 2–3-fold increase in DNA N-glycosylase activity, as we previously described (1Marenstein D.R. Ocampo M.T.A. Chan M.K. Altamirano A. Basu A.K. Boorstein R.J. Cunningham"

Facilitated transport of water across cell membranes must be highly selective to prevent uncontrolled movement of other solutes, protons, and ions. Discovery of the aquaporins provided a molecular explanation to these processes (2Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). More than 200 aquaporins have now been identified, and their presence has been established in most forms of life (3Agre P.

No aquaporin from Archaea has yet been characterized, although functional roles for a water channel protein have been predicted in these organisms (4Roberts M.F. Front.

Two major protein family subsets are presently recognized, water-selective channels (aquaporins) and glycerol-transporting homologs with varying water permeabilities (aquaglyceroporins). The permeation selectivity of new members of the protein family may be predicted by a small number of conserved residues (5Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C.

The frozen samples were freeze-substituted in acetone containing 2% osmium tetroxide at −80 °C for 2 days, then at −20 °C for 2 h, and 4 °C for 2 h. The samples were rinsed with fresh absolute acetone and embedded in Spurr resin (Quetol 653). Thin sections (70–80 nm) were gathered on copper grids covered with Formvar, double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined under a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7000). The plasmid pTrc10HisAqpZ (8Borgnia M.J. Kozono D. Calamita G. Maloney P.C. Agre P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI and SalI, andaqpM from M. marburgensis (19Ding X. Kitagawa Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2001; 92: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was inserted in place of AqpZ. The resulting construct, pTrc10HisAqpM (encoding 10-His-AqpM) contains the sequence of commercially available pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) with the sequenceNcoI-SalI, replaced by insertion of the sequence for a 10× His tag (MGHHHHHHHHHHSSIEGRHEF) followed by the coding sequence for AqpM. E. coli strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) was transformed with the expression construct. E. coli strain XL1Blue (Stratagene) transformed with pTrc10HisAqpZ was used for 10-His-AqpZ expression, and XL1Blue transformed with pTrc10HisGlpF (13Borgnia M.J. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2888-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) was used for 10-His-GlpF expression. For heterologous expression of rat AQP4, the plasmid pYES2 10xHis-hAQP1 (21Saparov S.M. Kozono D. Rothe U. Agre P. Pohl P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31515-31520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the gene encoding full-length rat AQP4 was inserted in place of hAQP1. Apep4-deficient strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiaewith lowered proteolytic activity was transformed with the expression construct. For expression of bacterial aquaporins, 1-liter cultures of E. coli harboring the pTrc10HisAqpM, pTrc10HisAqpZ, or pTrc10HisGlpF construct were propagated in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of about 1.5. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Harvested cells were resuspended in 1:100 culture volume of ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mmK2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subjected to three French press cycles (18,000 pounds/square inch) at 4 °C. For heterologous expression of rat AQP4, a 1-liter culture of pep4 S. cerevisiae harboring the pYES2–10xHis-rAQP4 construct was propagated in Ura- media (27 g of Dropout Base + 0.77 g of Complete supplement mixture minus uracil) at 30 °C to an optical density of about 1.0 and then harvested and used to inoculate 6 liters of YP-Gal (2% Bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% galactose). This culture was propagated at 30 °C for about 18 h to an optical density of around 6–7. Harvested cells were resuspended in 1/15 culture volume of 100 mm K2HPO4 and subjected to two French press cycles (20,000 pounds/square inch) at 4 °C. For all protein preparations, unbroken cells and debris were separated from the cell lysate by a 10-min centrifugation at 6,000 × g and discarded. The membrane fraction was recovered from the supernatant by a 60-min centrifugation at 200,000 ×g. The detergent OG was used for AqpM, GlpF, and rAQP4 purification; the detergent DM was used for AqpZ purification. The membrane fraction was resuspended to the volume used for French press with solubilization buffer (3% detergent in 100 mm K2HPO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 200 mmNaCl, pH 8.0) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was pelleted by a 45-min centrifugation at 200,000 × g and discarded. The soluble fraction was mixed with 1–2 ml of prewashed Ni-NTA-agarose beads and incubated with gentle agitation at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then packed in a glass/plastic Econo column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 100 bead volumes of wash buffer (2% detergent, 100 mm K2HPO4, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mmNaCl, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) to remove nonspecifically bound materials. Ni-NTA-agarose-bound material was eluted with 0.5–1-ml amounts of elution buffer (2% detergent, 100 mm K2HPO4, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 mm NaCl, and 1m imidazole, pH 7.0). Protein concentrations were measured by the Schaffner-Weissman filter protein assay method (22Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. Velocity sedimentation analysis was used to determine the oligomeric structure of purified protein. Detergent-solubilized material (2–10 μg of purified protein in a 200-μl sample volume) was layered on top of a 4-ml continuous sucrose gradient (20 mm Tris·HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3% OG, 1 mm NaN3, and 5–20% sucrose, pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 140,000 × g for 18 h in a KNOTRON swing-out TST60.4 rotor at 20 °C. Up to 20 fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE to determine the migration of the protein. Pure protein was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The sedimentation coefficient (s 20,w) of each species was determined by interpolation of the relative migrationversus sedimentation coefficient linear function for the following standards: cytochrome c (1.8), carbonic anhydrase (2.9), BSA (4.3), β-amylase (8.9), and catalase (11.2). Purified AqpM protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes by the dilution method, because the dialysis method yielded non-functional proteoliposomes. E. coli total lipid extract (acetone/ether preparation, Avanti Polar Lipids) was hydrated in 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml, incubated at room temperature for 1 h, divided into aliquots, and frozen at −80 °C. Before use, lipids were diluted in a borosilicate tube (16 × 125 mm) under a nitrogen/argon atmosphere to a final concentration of 45 mg/ml in 50 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.5, and pulsed in a bath sonicator until a clear suspension was obtained. A reconstitution mixture was prepared in a glass tube at room temperature by sequentially adding (to final concentrations) 100 mm MOPS-Na, pH 7.5, 1.25% (w/v) OG, 133 μg/ml purified protein, and 10 mg/ml sonicated lipids (protein/lipid = 1:75). The reconstitution mixture was injected into 25 volumes of assay buffer under constant stirring to dilute the detergent. Liposomes were harvested by centrifugation (45 min at 140,000 × g) and resuspended into assay buffer (50 mm MOPS and 150 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine, pH 7.50, with HCl). Protein content was measured as described (22Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. The osmotic behaviors of reconstituted proteoliposomes and control liposomes were analyzed by following the light scattering of the preparation in a stopped-flow apparatus with a dead time of ≤1 ms (SF-2001; KinTek Instruments, University Park, PA). Water permeability was measured by rapidly mixing 100 μl of a proteoliposome suspension (1 μg of protein and 75 μg of E. coli polar phospholipids) in assay buffer (see above) with a similar volume of hyperosmolar solution (assay buffer with 570 mosm sucrose added as an osmolyte) at 4 °C for 1 s. The osmotic gradient (285 mosm) drives water efflux, and the consequent reduction in vesicle volume is measured as an increase in the intensity of scattered light (λ = 600 nm). Equation 1describes the change in volume as a function of membrane permeability (23Zeidel M.L. Ambudkar S.V. Smith B.L. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7436-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). dVrel(t)/dt=Pf(S/V0)vw(Ci/Vrel(t)−C0)Equation 1 V rel, the vesicular volume relative to the initial volume, is proportional to the intensity of scattered light (24Illsley N.P. Verkman A.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and is dimensionless. P f is the osmotic water permeability; S/V 0 is vesicle surface area to initial volume ratio; v w is the partial molar volume of water (18 cm3); C i is the initial intravesicular osmolarity; and C o is the external osmolarity. Single-exponential time constants (k) were calculated by least squares fit of experimental data. A family of simulated curves was obtained by numerical integration of Equation 1and fitted to a single exponential. P f was estimated by iterative comparison of the experimental time constants with the values obtained from the simulation by using MATHCAD software. To determine permeability to glycerol and urea, proteoliposomes were equilibrated in assay buffer supplemented with glycerol or urea (∼570 mosm). The suspensions were then rapidly mixed with a solution in which osmolarity was compensated by a nonpermeant solute (sucrose). Glycerol and urea permeabilities were measured at 37 °C for 2–4 s under similar conditions as above. The external concentration of permeant solute is reduced by half (285 mosm) without a change in osmolarity, driving the efflux of the permeant osmolyte and generating an outwardly oriented osmotic gradient. Water efflux causes a reduction in volume and an increase in the intensity of scattered light. To investigate whether AqpM was sensitive to HgCl2, proteoliposomes were incubated with 0.1 mmHgCl2 for 30 min prior to assay; to test reversibility, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was incubated for an additional 30 min prior to assay. To determine the thermal stability of AqpM, the proteoliposomes were incubated at temperatures from 30 to 100 °C for 15 min and gradually returned to room temperature prior to permeability assays. For Arrhenius activation energies, water transport permeability measurements were undertaken at temperatures from 4 to 37 °C. A tetrameric derivative of the 2.2 Å x-ray diffraction structure of bovine aquaporin-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1J4N) (17Sui H. Han B.G. Lee J.K. Walian P. Jap B.K. Nature. 2001; 414: 872-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar) was used as the template. By using data from multiple sequence alignment, the amino acid sequence of AqpM was manually threaded through the template in Swiss Protein Database Viewer (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9397) Google Scholar). The optimal tertiary structure was computed by SWISS-MODEL. Figures were generated with VMD (26Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35699) Google Scholar) and Raster3D (27Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3866) Google Scholar). To evaluate the presence of a water channel in archaeon, M. marburgensis cells in exponential growth phase were subjected to hyperosmotic shock and visualized by transmission electron microscopy. Before treatment, cells appeared turgid (Fig. 1 A). When exposed to hyperosmotic shock with 1 m mannitol, the cells showed retraction of the cytoplasm forming plasmolytic spaces (Fig. 1 B). Minimal shrinkage was observed in M. marburgensis cells pretreated with HgCl2 (Fig.1 C), suggesting the functional expression of a water channel that can mediate osmotically driven water flux in this organism. A similar phenomenon was observed in wild-type E. coli but not in an AqpZ-null mutant (28Delamarche C. Thomas D. Rolland J.P. Froger A. Gouranton J. Svelto M. Agre P. Calamita G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4193-4197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently identified a single aquaporin-like sequence, aqpM, in the genome of M. marburgensis (19Ding X. Kitagawa Y. J. Biosci. Bioeng. 2001; 92: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence of AqpM was 71 and 50% identical to two candidate aquaporin sequences from other Archaea (Archaeglobus fulgidus andMethanosarcina barkeri) and 30–36% identical (with gaps) to sequences from eubacteria, yeast, plants, and mammals. Multiple alignments revealed residues that are highly conserved in each of the transmembrane domains as well as the functionally important loops B and E (Fig. 2 A). Compared with other homologs, the archaeal sequences have a relatively long loop A between TM1 and TM2. Information from the crystal structure of GlpF and hydropathy analysis provided a framework for predicting the membrane topology of AqpM (Fig. 2 B). We constructed a tree with the neighbor-joining method of phylogenetic inference (29Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), using sequences from aquaporin homologs that have been functionally characterized (2Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P.

Tohsaka A. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree did not distinguish whether AqpM is an aquaporin or an aquaglyceroporin (Fig. 2 C). In particular, the residues surrounding the narrowest region of the pore (Ile-187 and Ser-196) do not conform to the corresponding residues in either aquaporins (His-180 and Cys-189 in hAQP1) or aquaglyceroporins (Gly-191 and Phe-200 in GlpF). P2–P5 residues, which distinguish eukaryotic and eubacterial aquaporins from aquaglyceroporins, (4Roberts M.F. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D796-D812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not provide clear assignment for AqpM. The P2–P5 residues of AqpM (Thr-203, Tyr-207, Tyr-221, and Val-222) conform with only one residue in the aquaporins (Ser, Ala, Phe/Tyr, and Try) but with none in the aquaglyceroporins (Asp, Arg/Lys, Pro, and Ile/Leu). Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with 5 ng of aqpM cRNA failed to demonstrate increased water, glycerol, or urea permeabilities (data not shown) as shown for other aquaporins (37Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Presumably this reflects failure of eukaryotic oocytes to express an archaeal membrane protein, so we attempted protein expression in bacteria for reconstitution into proteoliposomes. The AqpM protein was predicted to contain only short N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains, so the DNA was cloned into the pTrc10HisAqpZ plasmid (8Borgnia M.J. Kozono D. Calamita G. Maloney P.C. Agre P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) encoding a polypeptide with a 21-residue extension with 10 consecutive histidine residues at the N terminus of AqpM (10-His-AqpM). E. coli cells transformed with pTrc10HisAqpM grew normally in LB-ampicillin medium. Addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside arrested growth but did not prevent protein expression. In our case, 1 liter of culture typically yielded 3–5 mg of purified protein. The purified 10-His-AqpM protein and standard proteins were separately loaded on sucrose gradients. The apparent sedimentation coefficient for the peak fraction, ∼5.9 S, was determined by comparing mobilities of 10-His-AqpM to standards ranging from 1.8 to 11.2 S (Fig. 3 A). The value for OG-solubilized 10-His-AqpM was slightly above the values obtained for DM-solubilized AqpZ (8Borgnia M.J. Kozono D. Calamita G. Maloney P.C. Agre P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and OG-solubilized AQP1 (40Mathai J.C. Agre P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which are known to be tetramers. When visualized by silver staining, the purified 10-His-AqpM protein migrated as a single molecular species of ∼110 kDa in 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE slabs. To evaluate the molecular mass of the ∼110-kDa species, the electrophoretic behavior in SDS-PAGE was investigated at different concentrations of acrylamide. A linear relationship was observed between the apparent molecular mass and the acrylamide concentration (Fig. 3 B), with faster mobility in gels of lower polymer content. This aberrant electrophoretic behavior is characteristic of aquaporins (41Helenius A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 415: 1-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (2387) Google Scholar). Together, the sedimentation and electrophoretic studies suggest that 10-His-AqpM exists as a tetramer when solubilized either in mild detergents, such as OG, or strong detergents, such as SDS, which usually unfolds and dissociates protein subunits. Dissociation of the tetramer was attempted under several different conditions. Incubation of the samples with chaotropic (8 murea or guanidinium chloride) or hydrophilic reducing agents (500 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 1000 mmdithiothreitol) did not cause any dissociation of 10-His-AqpM, even after 1 week (data not shown). Incubation at pH <4.0 (Fig.3 C) or with the reducing agent ethanedithiol at a concentration of 600 mm (Fig. 3 D) led to almost complete dissociation of 10-His-AqpM to a monomer with the predicted size of ∼24 kDa. AqpM proteoliposomes were prepared by dilution with E. coli lipids and 10-His-AqpM at a lipid-to-protein ratio of 75:1. AqpM proteoliposomes and control liposomes were abruptly transferred to an outwardly directed osmotic gradient, and the changes recorded in light scattering were measured at λem = 600 nm (Fig.4 A). AqpM proteoliposomes exhibited a moderately high osmotic water permeability of 57 ± 4 μm·s−1, whereas control liposomes yielded much lower permeability, 12 ± 0.7 μm·s−1. The permeability of AqpM proteoliposomes was 90% inhibited by treatment with 0.1 mm HgCl2. However, the inhibition was partially reversed with 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The Arrhenius activation energy was calculated from measurements performed at various temperatures from 4 to 37 °C, yielding a value (E a(water) = 2.67 kcal/mol) consistent with water transport through a channel as opposed to diffusion across the lipid bilayer as seen in control liposomes (E a(water) = 12.9 kcal/mol). AqpM proteoliposomes consistently exhibited a transient initial phase of glycerol permeability that was above the permeability of contro"
https://openalex.org/W2052873348,"Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (Smurf1), a HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with inhibitory Smad7 and induces translocation of Smad7 to the cytoplasm. Smurf1 then associates with the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β type I receptor, TβR-I, enhancing turnover. However, the mechanism of nuclear export of Smad7 by Smurf1 has not been elucidated. Here we identified a functional nuclear export signal (NES) in a C-terminal region of Smurf1. In transfected cells, the Smurf1-Smad7 complex was accumulated in the cytoplasm by the nuclear export receptor, CRM1; this action was prevented by treatment with leptomycin B, a specific inactivator of CRM1 function. A green fluorescence protein fusion protein containing the C-terminal NES motif of Smurf1, located in the cytoplasm, accumulated in the nucleus following treatment with leptomycin B. Moreover, Smurf1 was shown to bind physically to CRM1 through NES, and nuclear export of the Smurf1-Smad7 complex was prevented by mutations of Smurf1 within the NES. Finally, the Smurf1 NES mutant reduced inhibition by Smad7 of the transcriptional activation induced by TGF-β. These results thus suggest that CRM1-dependent nuclear export of Smurf1 is essential for the negative regulation of TGF-β signaling by Smad7."

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in CXCL12-induced and CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis of T-lymphocytes are not completely elucidated. In the present study, we examined the role of the membrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45, which regulates antigen receptor signaling in CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in T-cells. We observed a significant reduction in CXCL12-induced chemotaxis in the CD45-negative Jurkat cell line (J45.01) as compared with the CD45-positive control (JE6.1) cells. Expression of a chimeric protein containing the intracellular phosphatase domain of CD45 was able to partially restore CXCL12-induced chemotaxis in the J45.01 cells. However, reconstitution of CD45 into the J45.01 cells restored the CXCL12-induced chemotaxis to about 90%. CD45 had no significant effect on CXCL12 or human immunodeficiency virus gp120-induced internalization of the CXCR4 receptor. Furthermore, J45.01 cells showed a slight enhancement in CXCL12-induced MAP kinase activity as compared with the JE6.1 cells. We also observed that CXCL12 treatment enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45 and induced its association with the CXCR4 receptor. Pretreatment of T-cells with the lipid raft inhibitor, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, blocked the association between CXCR4 and CD45 and markedly abolished CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. Comparisons of signaling pathways induced by CXCL12 in JE6.1 and J45.01 cells revealed that CD45 might moderately regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion components the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase/Pyk2, focal adhesion kinase, p130Cas, and paxillin. CD45 has also been shown to regulate CXCR4-mediated activation and phosphorylation of T-cell receptor downstream effectors Lck, ZAP-70, and SLP-76.

Although CXCL12 acts as a potent chemoattractant for various cell types including T-cells and regulates the directional movement of these cells, relatively little is known about the signaling pathways that may mediate these effects (1Aiuti A. Webb I.J. Bleul C. Springer T. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 111-120Google Scholar, 11Bleul C.C. Wu L. Hoxie J.A. Springer T.A. Mackay C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 3067-3074Google Scholar) have recently deciphered the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating CXCR4 and CCR5-mediated chemotaxis. We have demonstrated that CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 stimulates multiple signaling pathways including activation of focal adhesion components such as the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK, also known as Pyk2 or Cak-β), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and p130Cas (12Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23169-23175Google Scholar). Furthermore, protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 have also been shown to be involved in CXCR4- or CCR5-mediated chemotaxis (13Vila-Coro A.J. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Martin De Ana A.

Cooper S. Anzai N. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 681-690Google Scholar). Hematopoietic cells derived from mice lacking SHP1 showed altered patterns of chemotactic response to CXCL12 (17Kim C.H. Qu C.K. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Anzai N. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 681-690Google Scholar). SHP2 was shown to associate with CXCR4 and to regulate the CXCL12-induced migration of T- and pre-B-cells (15Chernock R.D. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 608-615Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we further delineated the role of tyrosine phosphatases and showed that the membrane-bound tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is a key regulator of CXCL12-induced and CXCR4-mediated chemotaxis. CD45 is expressed exclusively on cells of hematopoietic lineage (18Alexander D.R. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 349-359Google Scholar, 19Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol.

Studies using CD45-deficient mice and cell lines revealed that this phosphatase is very important for thymocyte differentiation (24Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A. Kundig T.M. Kawai K.

Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Google Scholar). CD45 is shown to influence the early events in T-cell activation by operating as a positive, as well as negative, regulator of the Src family kinases, p56 Lck and p59 Fyn. Recent studies have also identified CD45 as a negative regulator of cytokine-mediated signaling by acting as a JAK tyrosine phosphatase (26Irie-Sasaki J. Sasaki T. Matsumoto W. Opavsky A. Cheng M. Welstead G. Griffiths E. Krawczyk C. Richardson C.D. Aitken K. Iscove N. Koretzky G. Johnson P. Liu P. Rothstein D.M. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 349-354Google Scholar). Thus, CD45 plays a crucial role in cytokine receptor-mediated differentiation, proliferation, and anti-viral responses. In addition, CD45 is also required for some integrin-mediated adhesion events (27Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E.D. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Google Scholar, 28Shenoi H. Seavitt J. Zheleznyak A. Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7120-7127Google Scholar). It has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis in humans (29Licastro F. Mallory M. Hansen L.A. Masliah E. J. Neuroimmunol. 1998; 88: 105-110Google Scholar,30Ballerini C.

Although our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CD45 in regulating TCR and cytokine receptor signaling have increased substantially, its role in chemokine-mediated biological functions has not been explored. In the present study, we have investigated the role of CD45 in regulating CXCL12-induced chemotaxis and MAP kinase activation in T-cells. Our data indicate a prominent role for CD45 in these processes and thus provide new information regarding CXCR4-mediated chemotactic signaling pathways. Purified antibodies to phosphospecific p44/42 MAP kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to p44/42 protein, phosphotyrosine (pTyr99), and p56Lck were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphospecific antibodies to RAFTK (Pyk2, pTyr402, pTyr881) and FAK (pTyr397) were obtained from BIOSOURCEInternational (Camarillo, CA). Phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), ZAP-70, and SLP-76 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Paxillin antibody was from Transduction Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Electrophoresis reagents and nitrocellulose membrane were obtained from Bio-Rad. The protease inhibitors leupeptin and antitrypsin, and all other reagents, were obtained from Sigma. The human T-cell line Jurkat, clone JE6.1, and the CD45-deficient variant of this clone, J45.01, were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). J45/CH11 (expressing a chimeric protein containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of HLA-A2 and the cytoplasmic domain of CD45), its control J45/A2 (expressing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of HLA-A2), and J45/LB3 (J45.01 transfectants expressing normal human CD45) were kindly provided by Dr. Gary A. Koretzky (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) and Dr. Eric J. Brown (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and have been described before (23Hovis R.R. Donovan J.A. Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Goldman F.D. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. Science. 1993; 260: 544-546Google Scholar). All the cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Primary lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized venous blood as described before (31Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Google Scholar). Blood collected from healthy donors was subjected to Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 25 min. The cells were suspended in RPMI containing 15% fetal calf serum, 2 mmglutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Monocytes were depleted by two rounds of adherence to plastic. Nonadherent cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) for 3 days. Cells were then removed to a fresh medium supplemented with recombinant human interleukin 2 (Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD). Two-week-old cells were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments to study the association of CD45 with CXCR4, as described below. CD45-negative (J45.01), Jurkat (JE6.1), J45/CH11, J45/A2, and J45/LB3 cells were washed twice with 1× Hanks' salt solution (Mediatech Co.), suspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in the same solution, and starved for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were next stimulated with 100 ng/ml CXCL12. After stimulation, the cells were microfuged for 10 s and lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 2 mm each of sodium vanadate and sodium fluoride, and 0.25 m sodium pyrophosphate). Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and kinase assay as described below. Immunoprecipitation analysis was done as described (12Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23169-23175Google Scholar, 15Chernock R.D. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 608-615Google Scholar). Briefly, equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were precleared by incubation with protein-A-Sepharose CL-4B/protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant from each sample was collected after brief centrifugation. Different primary antibody was added for each experiment, and samples were incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. The immune complexes were precipitated with 50 μl of protein-A-Sepharose CL-4B (50% suspension) or protein-G-Sepharose (10% suspension) overnight at 4 °C or for 36 h for anti-CXCR4 immunoprecipitations. The nonspecific bound proteins were removed by washing the Sepharose beads three times with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The immune complexes bound to the beads were either subjected to kinase assay or solubilized in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer and further analyzed by Western blotting, as described below. Western blot analyses were done as described previously. Briefly, equivalent amounts of protein from each sample were run on 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed and incubated with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). The data are representative of findings from three experiments. The activity of the bands was quantified by densitometric analysis using a Bio-Rad Imager. The mean densities of the bands are represented as the optical density in units/mm2. Assays were done as described previously (15Chernock R.D. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 608-615Google Scholar, 16Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3067-3074Google Scholar). Briefly, J45.01, JE6.1, J45/CH11, J45/A2, or J45/LB3 cells were washed twice, and 10 × 106 cells/ml were suspended in medium containing RPMI 1640 with 2.5% fetal calf serum. The chemotaxis assay was performed in 24-well plates containing 5-μm porosity inserts (Co-Star Corporation, Kennebunk, ME). 100 μl (1 × 106 cells) from each cell line (J45.01, JE6.1, J45/CH11, J45/A2, J45/LB3) was loaded onto the upper well. 0.6 ml of medium containing CXCL12 (0, 10, 50, 100 ng/ml) was added to the lower chamber. The plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation, the inserts were removed carefully, and the viable cells were counted using standard procedures. The results are expressed as the number of cells migrating to the bottom chamber. Each experiment was performed three or four times in triplicate. Kinase assay of the Src family member, Lck, was done as described (32Munshi N. Groopman J.E. Gill P.S. Ganju R.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1169-1174Google Scholar). Briefly, the immune complexes obtained by immunoprecipitating the cell lysates with antibodies to Lck were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μm Na3VO4, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). Finally, the immune complexes were incubated in a total volume of 25 μl of kinase buffer containing enolase as a substrate and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. The proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. Bands were detected by autoradiography. Confocal microscopy studies were done as described earlier (33Fernandis A.Z. Cherla R.P. Chernock R.D. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18111-18117Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat (JE6.1 clones) cells were washed twice with Hank's-buffered salt solution (Cellgro) and resuspended in Hank's-buffered salt solution at a density of 107 cells/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml CXCL12 at 37 °C for various time periods. Following stimulation, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 2 min on ice. The cells were washed and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. CXCR4 or CD45 was stained with anti-CXCR4 or anti-CD45 antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by staining with secondary antibody coupled to Texas red (Vector Laboratories) or phosphatidylethanolamine (Amersham Biosciences). The cells were cytofuged on slides, and the expression of these proteins was visualized using a Leica TCS confocal microscope. The CXCR4 or CD45 receptor on the JE6.1, J45.01, J45/CH11, J45/A2, or J45/LB3 cells was stained with phycoerythrin-coupled anti-CXCR4 or CD4 antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. For CXCR4 down-modulation analysis, JE6.1 or J45.01 cells were stimulated with CXCL12 (1 μg/ml) or HIV gp120 (1.2 μg/ml) for various time periods (0, 2, 4, 6 h). Following stimulation, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with anti-CXCR4 antibody as discussed above and then washed with PBS, suspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS, and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of data obtained from three or four experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate. The statistical significance was determined by the Student's t test. CXCL12-induced chemotaxis has been shown to be regulated by tyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 (15Chernock R.D. Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 608-615Google Scholar, 17Kim C.H. Qu C.K. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Anzai N. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 681-690Google Scholar). We have further extended these studies to evaluate the role of CD45 in CXCR4-mediated and CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. To examine the involvement of CD45 in the regulation of CXCL12-induced chemotaxis, the CD45-deficient Jurkat cell line J45.01 and CD45-expressing JE6.1 cells were assessed for their ability to migrate in response to different concentrations of CXCL12. The CD45-deficient J45.01 cells showed a reduced response (>75%) toward CXCL12-induced (50 ng/ml) chemotaxis in comparison to the control JE6.1 Jurkat cells (Fig.1 A). The difference in chemotactic response toward CXCL12 was consistent over a concentration range of 10–100 ng/ml, levels at which optimal migration has been reported (16Cherla R.P. Ganju R.K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3067-3074Google Scholar). However, migratory response was less significant at higher concentrations of CXCL12 (500–1000 ng/ml) (data not shown). Next, we identified the region of CD45 important for CXCL12-induced chemotaxis by assaying the ability of transfectants expressing hybrid CD45 cDNA to restore chemotaxis. As shown in Fig.1, B and D, CD45-deficient Jurkat cells expressing a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular domain and transmembrane domain of the class I major histocompatibility complex protein and the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (J45/CH11) partially restored the CXCL12-induced chemotaxis as compared with cells expressing only the extracellular and transmembrane regions of the class I major histocompatibility complex protein (J45/A2). Furthermore, reconstitution of J45.01 cells with normal human CD45 (J45/LB3) significantly restored the CXCL12-induced chemotaxis (Fig.1 C). These results show that expression of the full-length CD45 (J45/LB3) restored the CXCL12-induced chemotaxis to about 90%, whereas cells expressing only the cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (J45/CH11) restored the chemotaxis to about 65% as compared with the JE6.1 parental cell line (Fig. 1 D). Similar levels of CXCR4 receptor were expressed by all cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, the differences in chemotaxis observed in the various Jurkat clones and transfectants are not because of variation in CXCR4 levels. CXCL12 and gp120 at higher concentrations have been shown to induce CXCR4 receptor internalization (33Fernandis A.Z. Cherla R.P. Chernock R.D. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18111-18117Google Scholar). CXCR4 trafficking is important in HIV infection and immune regulation. Recently, we have shown that the proteasome pathway regulates CXCL12-induced down-modulation and chemotaxis (33Fernandis A.Z. Cherla R.P. Chernock R.D. Ganju R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18111-18117Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, we have shown that CD45 regulates CXCL12-induced chemotaxis. Thus, we next explored the role of CD45 in the ligand-induced down-modulation of the CXCR4 receptor. No significant difference in CXCL12 or HIV gp120-induced down-modulation of CXCR4 was observed between the CD45-positive JE6.1 (Fig.2 A) and CD45-negative J45.01 (Fig. 2 B) cells. These results suggest that CD45 does not regulate the CXCL12- or gp120-induced pathway leading to CXCR4 internalization. To investigate further CD45-regulated chemotactic signaling mechanisms, we first determined the tyrosine phosphorylation status of CD45 upon CXCL12 treatment in the CD45-positive JE6.1 cells. As shown in Fig.3 A, CXCL12 stimulation induced the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of CD45. This phosphorylation was rapid and reached a maximum level between 0.5 to 2.5 min. Equal amounts of CD45 protein were present in each lane (Fig.3 A, bottom panel). We also investigated whether the CXCR4 receptor associates with CD45 by coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting studies. Cell lysates obtained from CD45-positive JE6.1 cells (Fig. 3 B) or peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig.3 C) stimulated with CXCL12 were immunoprecipitated with anti-CXCR4 antibody and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-CD45 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, CXCL12 stimulation induced the association of the CXCR4 receptor with CD45. Equal amounts of protein were present in each lane as detected by immunoblotting the lysates with anti-actin antibody (Fig.3, B and C, bottom panels). The association of CXCR4 with CD45 was further confirmed by confocal microscopy. CD45-positive cells (JE6.1) were stimulated with CXCL12 (100 ng/ml) for different time periods. The cells were fixed and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD45 (green) or phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-CXCR4 (red) antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 D, a marked colocalization (yellow) of the two proteins was observed upon CXCL12 stimulation. CXCL12 treatment also induced the clustering of CXCR4 and CD45 into pseudopodia-like structures (Fig.3 D). Plasma membranes of many cell types, including T-cells, contain microdomains referred to as lipid rafts (34Pierini L.M. Maxfield F.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9471-9473Google Scholar, 35Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Google Scholar, 36Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Google Scholar). These domains are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, which form a lateral assembly in a saturated glycerophospholipid environment. The domains are known to serve as moving platforms on the cell surface and are more ordered and resistant to detergents like Triton X-100. The domains also act as good sites for cross-talk between various proteins. These include cytoskeletal proteins, Src family kinases, protein kinase C, actin-binding proteins, G proteins, and various molecules involved in TCR signaling (35Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Google Scholar, 36Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Google Scholar). Lipid rafts have also been shown to be important for T-cell polarization and chemotaxis (37Tibaldi E.V. Salgia R. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7582-7587Google Scholar, 38Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A. Manes S. Martinez A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9642-9647Google Scholar). To characterize the role of lipid rafts in CXCR4-mediated signaling, we examined the effect of the lipid raft inhibitor, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MBC), on the association of CXCR4 with CD45. As shown in Fig.4 A, pretreatment of JE6.1 cells with MBC (10 mm) inhibited the CD45 and CXCR4 association, as detected by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. An equal amount of protein was present in eachlane as detected by immunoblotting the lysates with anti-actin antibody (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel). Furthermore, we observed that MBC treatment attenuated CXCL12-induced chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner in medium without serum (Fig. 4 B). The maximum inhibition observed was at a 10 mm concentration. However, no effect on chemotaxis at various MBC concentrations was observed in medium containing 2.5% serum (Fig. 4 C). The lack of effect may be because of cholesterol replenishment under this condition. Src kinases have been shown to play an important role in cell migration and adhesion (39Timpson P. Jones G.E.

https://openalex.org/W2103601033,"Molting in crustaceans is controlled by molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and ecdysteroids. It is presumed that MIH inhibits the synthesis and the secretion of ecdysteroids by the Y-organ, resulting in molt suppression. The amino acid sequence of MIH is similar to that of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), and therefore, they form a peptide family referred to as the CHH family. Most of the CHH family peptides show no cross-activity, whereas a few peptides show multiple hormonal activities. To reveal the structural basis of this functional specificity, we determined the solution structure of MIH from the Kuruma prawn Marsupenaeus japonicus and compared the solution structure of MIH with a homology-modeled structure of M. japonicus CHH. The solution structure of MIH consisted of five α-helices and no β-structures, constituting a novel structural motif. The homology-modeled structure of M. japonicus CHH was very similar to the solution structure of MIH with the exception of the absence of the N-terminal α-helix and the C-terminal tail, which were sterically close to each other. The surface properties of MIH around this region were quite different from those of CHH. These results strongly suggest that this region is a functionally important site for conferring molt-inhibiting activity.

These results strongly suggest that this region is a functionally important site for conferring molt-inhibiting activity. Molting is one of the most significant processes occurring during the arthropod life cycle and is triggered by a molting hormone, ecdysteroids. In crustaceans, it is presumed that the synthesis and the secretion of ecdysteroids by the Y-organ are suppressed by molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) 1The abbreviations used are: MIH, molt-inhibiting hormone; r-MIH, recombinant M. japonicus MIH; CHH, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; SGP, sinus gland peptide (1Soumoff C. O'Connor J.D. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1982; 48: 432-439Google Scholar). MIH is produced by the X-organ and released from the sinus gland located in the eyestalk. Crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), gonad-inhibiting hormone, and mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone are also synthesized in and released from the X-organ/sinus gland complex. Most of these peptides consist of 72–78 amino acid residues and exhibit similar amino acid sequences. Therefore, these peptides form a peptide family referred to as the CHH family (2Keller R. Experientia. 1992; 48: 439-448Google Scholar). The CHH family peptides commonly have six cysteine residues, which form three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Circular dichroism spectral analyses of some CHH family peptides demonstrated that they were rich in α-helices (3Huberman A. Aguilar M.B. Brew K. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Peptides. 1993; 14: 7-16Google Scholar, 4Chung J.S. Webster S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 358-364Google Scholar, 5Katayama H. Ohira T. Nagata K. Nagasawa H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1832-1839Google Scholar). However, there has so far been no report on the determination of the tertiary structure of any of the CHH family peptides. CHH family peptides show various biological activities: some peptides that suppress molting, increase hemolymph glucose levels, and suppress vitellogenesis in the ovary and others that suppress the synthesis of methyl farnesoate in the mandibular organ (2Keller R. Experientia. 1992; 48: 439-448Google Scholar). In general, each CHH family peptide shows only one type of biological activity, although a few peptides show multiple hormonal activities. For instance, CHH from the American lobster Homarus americanus also exhibits molt-inhibiting activity (6Chang E.S. Bruce M.J. Newcomb R.W. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1987; 65: 56-64Google Scholar), and mandibular organ-inhibiting hormone from the spider crab Libinia emarginata exhibits hyperglycemic activity (7Lei L. Laufer H. Arch. Insect. Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 32: 375-385Google Scholar). To reveal the structural basis of the functional specificity of the CHH family peptides, we have elucidated the solution structure of MIH from the Kuruma prawn Marsupenaeus japonicus by heteronuclear three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. In this paper, we propose the functionally important sites of the CHH family peptides presumed from the comparison of the tertiary and surface structures between MIH and CHH. A recombinant M. japonicusMIH (r-MIH) was overproduced using a pET-28a(+) plasmid (Novagen) inEscherichia coli BL21-Codonplus™(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) and purified after the refolding reaction as described previously (5Katayama H. Ohira T. Nagata K. Nagasawa H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1832-1839Google Scholar, 8Ohira T. Nishimura T. Sonobe H. Okuno A. Watanabe T. Nagasawa H. Kawazoe I. Aida K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1576-1581Google Scholar). Uniformly 15N-labeled and13C/15N-doubly labeled r-MIHs were obtained by growing the cells in M9 minimal medium. The refolded r-MIH was dissolved in 30% acetonitrile aqueous solution at the concentration of 100 μg/ml. The CD spectrum was recorded from 200 to 260 nm on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature with a 1-mm path length cell. All NMR spectra were measured on a Varian Unity INOVA500 spectrometer at 25 °C. Sample solution was prepared at a concentration of 1–2 mm in 30% C2H3CN, 70% 2H2O or 30% C2H3CN, 10% 2H2O, 60% 1H2O. Chemical shifts were referenced to sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. All of the non-labile1H, 13C, and 15N atoms in r-MIH were assigned by the standard triple resonance NMR experiments. All of the NMR spectra were processed using the software NMRPipe (version 1.6) (9Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) on an Octane work station (Silicon Graphics). Interproton distance restraints were obtained from cross-peak intensities in15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra (10Muhandiram D.R. Farrow N.A. Xu G.-Y. Smallcombe S.H. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 317-321Google Scholar,11Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6150-6156Google Scholar). Peak intensities on the13C-edited and the15N-edited NOESY spectra were translated to interproton distances based on the relation of NOE ∝ (distance)−6. The upper bound distance restraints were set to the calculated distances plus 1.0 Å considering internal mobility. φ-Angle restraints were derived from 3 J HNHαcoupling constants obtained from HNHA spectrum (12Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Google Scholar) and secondary structure predicted from the chemical shifts of HN, Cα, and C′ by the program CSI (version 1.0) (13Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Google Scholar). φ-Angles were restrained to the range of −90 to −40° for the residues that satisfied both of the following criteria. 1) the coupling constant (3 J HNHα) was <6 Hz. 2) The residue was predicted to be α-helical by CSI. Three-dimensional structure was calculated with the disulfide bond distance restraints and the NMR-derived restraints including interproton distance restraints and torsion angle restraints. 50 random conformations were annealed in 10,000 steps by torsion angle dynamics with the program DYANA (version 1.4) (14Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Google Scholar). Ten conformers having the lowest DYANA target functions were used to present the solution conformation of r-MIH. Ramachandran φ-ψ-plot analysis was performed with PROCHECK NMR (version 3.4) (15Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). Secondary structure was defined, and tertiary structure was visualized with MOLMOL (version 2.6) (16Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar). The DALI server (17Holm M. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) was used in the search for structurally similar proteins to r-MIH. Homology modeling of CHH was performed using the SWISS model server (18Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). The r-MIH (8Ohira T. Nishimura T. Sonobe H. Okuno A. Watanabe T. Nagasawa H. Kawazoe I. Aida K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1576-1581Google Scholar) was shown to be functionally and structurally identical to native MIH by comparison of molt-inhibiting activity, arrangement of the disulfide linkages, and the CD spectra (5Katayama H. Ohira T. Nagata K. Nagasawa H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2001; 65: 1832-1839Google Scholar, 8Ohira T. Nishimura T. Sonobe H. Okuno A. Watanabe T. Nagasawa H. Kawazoe I. Aida K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1576-1581Google Scholar). It was not possible to dissolve r-MIH in water or phosphate-buffered saline at high concentrations above 1 mm. However, r-MIH could be dissolved in 30% aqueous acetonitrile at concentrations over 2 mm. In addition, r-MIH in this solution showed essentially the same CD spectrum as that in phosphate-buffered saline, indicating that the conformation of r-MIH remained intact in this solution (data not shown). Thus, we used 30% acetonitrile as the solvent for the NMR experiments. All of the non-labile1H, 13C, and 15N atoms of r-MIH were assigned based on the standard triple resonance NMR experiments (Table I). A total of 2252 restraints including 2209 distance restraints and 43 torsion angle restraints was obtained from the NMR data and used in the structural calculations of r-MIH. A set of 10 structures was selected from 50 calculated structures based on the agreement with the experimental data. In these selected structures, there were no violations greater than 0.4 Å and 2° in interproton distances and torsion angles, respectively. The solution structure of r-MIH was well defined with the exception of the N- and C-terminal regions. The pairwise root mean square deviations among the 10 structures were 0.51 ± 0.09 Å for the backbone heavy atoms (N, Cα, and C′) and 1.24 ± 0.10 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms in the well defined region (Asn5-Ala75). The conformation of the N-terminal (Ser1-Asp4) and C-terminal (Gly76-Gln77) regions was much less defined, because only a few restraints were obtained for these regions. In the Ramachandran φ-ψ-plot for the well defined region of the 10 selected structures, 99.8% φ-ψ plot was located in the favored and allowed regions (Table I).Table IStructural statistics for the 10 DYANA structures of r-MIHInter proton distance restraintsAll2152Intraresidual (‖i − j‖ = 0)475Sequential (‖i − j‖ = 1)470Medium-range (2 ≤ ‖i − j‖ ≤ 5)704Long range (6 ≤ ‖i − j‖)503Hydrogen bond distance restraints48Disulfide bond distance restraints9φ-Angle restraints43Distance restraints violationsSum (Å)9.0 ± 0.6Maximum (Å)0.34 ± 0.02φ-Angle restraints violationsSum (°)1.3 ± 0.8Maximum (°)0.8 ± 0.4van der Waals distance restraints violationsSum (Å)5.2 ± 0.7Maximum (Å)0.28 ± 0.02DYANA target function (Å2)1.94 ± 0.21Root mean square deviations of atomic coordinatesBackbone (N, Cα, C“) (Å)0.51 ± 0.09Heavy atoms (Å)1.24 ± 0.10Ramachandran φ-ψ plotMost favored (%)63.5Additionally allowed (%)26.8Generally allowed (%)9.5Disallowed (%)0.2 Open table in a new tab Fig.1 A shows the best-fit superposition of the backbone atoms of r-MIH. The r-MIH molecule consists of an N-terminal region, five α-helices (α1, Val10-Asn13; α2, Ile16-Phe31; α3, Pro34-Cys40; α4, Glu49-Lys55; and α5, Glu62-Ile72), four loops between the α-helices (L1–2, L2–3, L3–4, and L4–5), and a C-terminal tail region (Fig. 1 B). The disulfide bonds linked N-terminal region and L3–4, α2 and α3, and α2 and α4. This α-helical structure is consistent with the prediction of the secondary structure by CSI. The conformation of r-MIH was stabilized by a number of hydrophobic interactions in the cluster of nine hydrophobic residues (Leu16, Val20, Val23, Phe46, Phe50, Leu54, Phe66, Ile70, and Leu73) and the three disulfide bonds (Fig. 1 C). These hydrophobic and cysteine residues are conserved in most of the CHH family peptides as shown in Fig. 2, suggesting that the CHH family peptides harbor similar foldings. We searched for proteins structurally similar to MIH using the DALI server (17Holm M. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar), and several were found to be similar to MIH including RNA polymerase ς-factor, DNA ligase fragment, and acyl-CoA oxidase. However, the Z-scores of these proteins for MIH, which indicate the extent of similarity in three-dimensional structure, were very low (3.4 at highest); thus, we concluded that these proteins were not structurally similar to MIH. These results indicated that CHH family peptides would form a novel class of folds. The tertiary structure of Pej-SGP-III, one of theM. japonicus CHHs that has a 32% sequence identity to M. japonicus MIH (19Yang W.-J. Aida K. Nagasawa H. Aquaculture. 1995; 135: 205-212Google Scholar), was homology-modeled using the SWISS model server (18Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar). Fig.3 C shows the modeled structure of CHH. This structure is very similar to the solution structure of r-MIH with the exception that CHH lacks α1. In the CHH family peptides, MIHs have a glycine residue inserted at position 12 (20). The solution structure of r-MIH shows that this glycine residue is located at α1. The absence of α1 in CHH may be because of the lack of the glycine residue. Because the C-terminal sequence of CHH is shorter than that of MIH by a few amino acids, the CHH lacked the C-terminal region present in MIH. The C-terminal region of MIH was located close to α1in the tertiary structure (Fig. 3 A). The surface properties including electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity of these peptides were different in this terminal region (Fig. 3, B andD). Therefore, it was presumed that the region containing α1 and the C terminus was important for molt-inhibiting activity. Fig. 3,E and F, shows the surface structures of MIH and CHH. The residues conserved or homologous only within MIHs (positions 12, 13, 19, 20, 48, 56, 59, 61, 62, 69, 72, 73, and 76) are indicated in green, and the residues conserved or homologous only within CHHs (positions 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 19, 27, 42, 46, 54, 56, 57, 70, and 72) are indicated in blue. Thus, the green residues are mainly located on the front in Fig. 3 E, and the blue residues are dispersed all over the molecular surface. Therefore, the green-colored side in the MIH was considered to be important for the molt-inhibiting activity. As this side of the molecule includes α1 and the C terminus, these results were consistent with the presumption described above. Our previous study demonstrated that the C-terminal amide moiety of CHH is significant in conferring biological activity (21Katayama H. Ohira T. Aida K. Nagasawa H. Peptides. 2002; 23: 1537-1546Google Scholar, 22Ohira T. Katayama H. Aida K. Nagasawa H. Fisheries Sci. 2003; 69: 95-100Google Scholar). In addition, the C-terminally truncated CHH from the South African spiny lobsterJasus lalandii, which lacked six C-terminal amino acid residues, showed no hyperglycemic activity (23Marco H.G. Brandt W. Stoeva S. Voelter W. Gäde G. Peptides. 2000; 21: 19-27Google Scholar). These results suggest that the functional site of CHH may be located at the C-terminal region. On the basis of our results from the present experiments, we propose the hypothesis that the functionally important sites of CHH family peptides may be located at the region containing α1 and the C terminus. In conclusion, we have determined the solution structure of MIH and have demonstrated the existence of a novel structural motif. This is the first report on the tertiary structure analysis of a crustacean neuropeptide. The elucidation of this solution structure is expected to provide new insights, shedding light not only on structure-activity relationships but also on the molecular evolution of the CHH family peptides We thank Dr. M.

Recent analyses have verified the prediction that AlkB is a member of the Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenase family of enzymes. AlkB mediates repair of methylated DNA by direct demethylation of 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine lesions.

Assays measuring 2OG turnover were used to investigate the selectivity of AlkB. 1-Methyladenosine, 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, 3-methylcytidine, and 3-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine all stimulated 2OG turnover by AlkB but were not demethylated indicating an uncoupling of 2OG and prime substrate oxidation and that oligomeric DNA is required for hydroxylation and subsequent demethylation. In contrast the equivalent unmethylated nucleosides did not stimulate 2OG turnover indicating that the presence of a methyl group in the substrate is important in initiating oxidation of 2OG. Stimulation of 2OG turnover by 1-methyladenosine was highly dependent on the presence of a reducing agent, ascorbate or dithiothreitol. Following the observation that AlkB is inhibited by high concentrations of 2OG, analogues of 2OG, including 2-mercaptoglutarate, were found to specifically inhibit AlkB. The flavonoid quercetin inhibits both AlkB and the 2OG oxygenase factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) in vitro. FIH inhibition by quercetin occurs in the presence of excess iron indicating a specific interaction, while the inhibition of AlkB by quercetin is, predominantly, due to nonspecific iron chelation.

Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). DNA can be alkylated by a variety of agents that occur both exogenously and endogenously (2Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar, 3Sedgwick B. Vaughan P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Alkylating agents are used in some chemotherapy treatments, and alkylated DNA bases have been detected in the urine of smokers (4Kopplin A. Eberleadamkiewicz G. Glusenkamp K.H. Nehls P. Kirstein U. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2637-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). AlkB catalyzes demethylation of DNA and along with AlkA, AidB, and Ada is one of four proteins involved in the adaptive response to alkylation damaged DNA in Escherichia coli (5Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Ada, which has been termed the “suicidal repair protein,” contains two active sites, one of which demethylatesO6-methylguanine by irreversible transfer of the methyl group to a cysteine (5Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 6Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res.-Rev. Mutat.

The second active site removes methyl groups from S-methyl phosphoesters by nucleophilic methylation of another cysteine residue (5Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev.

Methylation of the latter cysteine converts Ada into a strong transcriptional activator of both its own production and the other three proteins of the adaptive response (9Landini P. Volkert M.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6543-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). AlkA is a DNA glycosylase with a wide substrate selectivity, including excision of cytotoxic 3-methyladenine residues (10Wyatt M.D. Allan J.M. Lau A.Y. Ellenberger T.E. Samson L.D. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). AlkA “flips” the damaged base out of the DNA double helix by inserting Leu-125 into the position occupied by the damaged base (11Hollis T. Ichikawa Y. Ellenberger T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The glycosidic bond is then cleaved, and the abasic site repaired by the standard base excision repair pathway. AidB is poorly characterized, but it may be involved in the destruction of certain alkylating agents (5Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). AlkB is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals (12Wei Y.F. Carter K.C. Wang R.P. Shell B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). AlkBknockout mutants are defective at repairing DNA methylation damage induced by SN2 type methylating agents including dimethyl sulfate, methyl iodide, and methyl methane sulfonate (MMS)1 (13Kataoka H.

Recently, two groups have independently confirmed the predictions based upon sequence analyses (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Biol. 2001; (research/0007.0001–0007.0008): 2Google Scholar) that AlkB is a member of the non-heme FeII family of oxygenases, requiring a 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) molecule as a cosubstrate (17Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 18Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that AlkB repairs the cytotoxic 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine lesions in both single and double-stranded DNA by an oxidative process (Fig.1). The reaction most probably proceeds by hydroxylation of the methyl group, leading to its extrusion as formaldehyde. Such a direct repair mechanism is likely to be efficient as unlike the nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair pathways, it is not reliant on a complementary strand for maintenance of genetic information. The 2OG-dependent family of oxygenase enzymes are involved in a range of metabolic processes in humans including the biosynthesis of collagen and carnitine (19Prescott A.G. Lloyd M.D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000; 17: 367-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). They also play a key role in the hypoxic response, where it has been proposed that enzymes catalyzing hydroxylations of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) act as oxygen sensors (20Jaakkola P.

Inhibition of the HIF hydroxylases offers potential to develop pro-angiogenic agents; however, inhibitors of the asparagine and prolyl hydroxylases will need to be selective for the target 2OG oxygenases. Here we report work that supports the identification of AlkB as a 2OG-dependent oxygenase and demonstrate its inhibition by 2OG analogues. Further, we report that in the presence of the nucleoside substrates 1-methyladenosine, 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, 3-methylcytidine, and 3-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine, there is a stimulation of 2OG turnover by AlkB. However, the 2OG reaction does not appear to be coupled to hydroxylation of the prime substrate. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma; oligonucleotides (Sigma-Genosys); restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs); Pfu Turbo, ligation kit, and competent cells (Stratagene); pET-24a(+) vector (Novagen); Gentra systems kit for purification of E. coli DNA, 1-[14C]-2-oxoglutarate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); hyamine hydroxide (ICN Radiochemicals); and Opti-phase “SAFE” scintillant (Fisher). AlkB was cloned from genomicE. coli DNA by PCR using the primers: forward 5′-GGTGGTCATATGTTGGATCTGTTTGCC-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTGGTGGATCCTTATTCTTTTTTACCTGC-3′. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pET-24a(+). The pET-24a(+)-alkB plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold competent cells, and growth conditions were optimized. Initially cultures were grown at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.6, where isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm and the temperature was dropped to 28 °C. Cells were harvested after 4 h by centrifugation. AlkB was produced as approximately 10% of the total soluble protein (by SDS-PAGE analysis). Cells (15 g) were resuspended on ice in 50 ml of 100 mm MES, pH 5.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 μg ml−1 lysozyme, 4 μg ml−1 DNaseI, then sonicated (Ultrasonics Inc., W-380) with 4 × 30-s pulses and centrifuged (Beckman JA25–50) for 20 min at 19,000 rpm. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane and loaded on to a (50 ml) S-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), run at 10 ml min−1 in 100 mm MES, pH 5.8. AlkB was eluted with a gradient of 0–1m NaCl over 400 ml. AlkB-containing fractions were pooled and diluted 3-fold prior to loading on a (6 ml) Resource-S column (Amersham Biosciences) run at 8 ml min−1; again AlkB was eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl over 180 ml. AlkB-containing fractions were concentrated and loaded onto a (720 ml, Superdex-75) gel filtration column at 3 ml min−1 in 150 mm TRIS, pH 7.5. This yielded ∼30 mg of AlkB with >95% purity (by SDS-PAGE analysis). Methylated DNA oligonucleotides were prepared using a modified version of literature procedures (22Bodell W.J. Singer B. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2860-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Encell L. Shuker D.E.G. Foiles P.G. Gold B. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Polydeoxyadenine (poly(dA)) and polydeoxycytosine (poly(dC)) were both 15 mer. The 27 mer and 33 mer were of random sequence and contained all four DNA bases. Prior to reaction with MMS oligomers were dissolved at 0.05 mm in 10 mmTRIS, pH 7.5. MMS (240 mm in EtOH) was added to a final concentration of 24 mm. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 24 h. The DNA was precipitated by addition of 3 volumes of ice-cold EtOH (0.3 m acetate, pH 5.2) and placing at −80 °C for 30 min. The sample was then centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the precipitated DNA was washed six times with EtOH. DNA concentration was measured by UV spectroscopy. 1-Methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine was prepared using the procedure of Singer et al. (24Singer B. Sun L. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). 1-Methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine was the major product, produced in ∼20% yield (∼75% of starting material remained). Yield was estimated by integration of the HPLC trace at 260 nm. 1-Methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine was purified by HPLC using a Phenomenex LUNA C-18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm). All solvents were filtered through 0.2-μm filters and sparged with He (g) at 100 ml min−1 for 20 min before use. The column was run at 3.2 ml min−1 in 50 mmammonium acetate, pH 6.4, and 5% acetonitrile for 25 min, and then a gradient was run to 30% acetonitrile over 5 min and held there for 10 min. Isolated 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine m/z (ESI+) 266 Da; UV: λmax(pH 7) 259 nm, λmax(pH 1) 259 nm, λmax(pH 13) 260 nm, λinflection(pH 13) 279 nm. As expected these UV profiles were the same as those obtained for the commercial 1-methyladenosine. 3-Methyl-2′-deoxycytidine was prepared using the same procedure as for methylation of 2′-deoxyadenosine. Isolated 3-methyl-2′-deoxycytidinem/z(ESI+) 242 Da; UV: λmax(pH 7) 278 nm, λmax(pH 1) 278 nm, λmax(pH 13) 267 nm. As expected these UV profiles were the same as those obtained for the commercial 3-methylcytidine. This assay is based on the method used to measure 14CO2release by α-ketoisocaproate oxygenase (25Sabourin P.J. Bieber L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7460-7467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard assay conditions comprise a total volume of 100 μl, 50 mm TRIS, pH 7.5, 4 mm ascorbate, 160 μm 2OG (2.5% 1-[14C]), 80 μm(NH4)2SO4.FeSO4.6H2O, 0.48 mg ml−1 catalase, 12.5 μm AlkB. Generally two stocks were made, one total volume of 25 μl contained AlkB and FeII, the second total volume of 75 μl contained all other reagents. Assays were started by the addition of the FeII, AlkB stock to the other stock. A tube containing 200 μl of hyamine hydroxide was added, and the vial sealed. The assays were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and quenched with 20% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (300 μl). They were then left on ice for 30 min to collect 14CO2 gas before the hyamine hydroxide was removed and treated with scintillant for counting (Beckman, LS6500). Assay points were performed in triplicate unless otherwise stated, values quoted are an average with standard deviation given as the error. DNA oligomers were incubated at a final concentration of 10 μm. Nucleoside and base substrates were dissolved at 20 mm in Me2SO, these were added to a final concentration of 400 μm, and AlkB activity was not affected by the presence of 2% (v/v) Me2SO. For the inhibitor, replacement of ascorbate and variation of 2OG concentration assays 800 μm1-methyladenosine was present. Inhibitors were assayed at five concentrations around the approximate IC50 value; the maximum concentration of inhibitor tested was 4 mm. Initial rate was plotted against inhibitor concentration in an Excel worksheet, a curve was fitted to the data, and the equation for the curve was solved for half the rate in the absence of inhibitor to give an approximate IC50 value. For assays in which FeII concentration was varied with inhibitor concentration held at IC50, FeII was added to a final concentration of 40, 80, 160, 250, and 500 μm. For the assays using an alternative reducing agent a 100-mm stock of reducing agent was made and added to a final concentration of 4 mm. For variation of ascorbate concentration assays, ascorbate was added to a final concentration of 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 4 mm. For variation of 2OG concentration assays, 2OG was added to a final concentration 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, and 700 μm; these assays were single points and carried out at both 80 and 250 μmFeII. Graphs showing variation of ascorbate and 2OG concentration were plotted in SigmaPlot. HPLC was carried out using a Synergi C-18 Hydro column (250 × 4.6 mm 4 μm) from Phenomenex, and the elutant was analyzed using a Photodiode Array Detector. All solvents were filtered through 0.2-μm filters and sparged with He (g) at 100 ml min−1 for 20 min before use. Prior to injection 1% (v/v) acetic acid was added to samples, and they were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The column was run at 0.8 ml min−1 in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.4, and 2% acetonitrile for 25 min, and then a gradient was run to 30% acetonitrile over 5 min and held there for 10 min. AlkB assays for HPLC were carried out using the same concentrations of reagents as above except that no radiolabeled 2OG was present, and they were quenched with 1 volume of MeOH after 40 min and placed on ice to precipitate the protein. HPLC runs for 1-methlyadenosine, 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, 3-methlycytidine, and 3-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine assays were also analyzed with some demethylated nucleoside added to confirm that product would be detected if demethylation had occurred. The same conditions were used for the LCMS assays with products being analyzed with a Micromass ZMD mass spectrometer electrospray ionization (+). Factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) was purified and assayed as described previously with the C-terminal fragment of HIF1α-(775–826) as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was used as a substrate (21Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

The alkB gene was cloned from E. coli and inserted into the pET-24a(+) vector. A three column protocol was developed for purification of AlkB based on cation exchange and gel filtration chromatography, giving the desired protein at >95% purity by SDS-PAGE analysis. AlkB activity was analyzed by incubating AlkB with 1-[14C]2OG and measuring the release of 14CO2 upon formation of succinate (25Sabourin P.J. Bieber L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7460-7467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results were consistent with the conclusions of Falnes et al. and Trewick et al. that AlkB is a 2OG-dependent FeII dioxygenase (17Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar,18Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Several oligonucleotides including poly(dA) and poly(dC) were reacted with the SN2 methylating agent MMS. When assayed with AlkB, the unmethylated oligonucleotides did not increase 2OG turnover significantly above the uncoupled rate (TableI). However, the methylated oligonucleotides gave rise to a significant increase in decarboxylation of 2OG by AlkB. The methylated oligomers used to ascertain the identity of the substrates of AlkB (18Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) are not precisely defined in a chemical sense as they are made by nonspecific methylation of an oligomeric substrate. Consequently, monomeric, potential substrates were assayed to probe the structural features of DNA that are required for AlkB catalysis.Table I2OG turnover by AlkB in the presence of oligomers before and after they had been treated with MMSOligomeric ssDNA substrate2OG turnoverpmol/sNo substrate1.00 ± 0.227 Mer1.39 ± 0.4Me27 mer2.76 ± 0.233 Mer0.92 ± 0.1Me33 mer2.21 ± 0.3poly(dA)1.55 ± 0.4Mepoly(dA)2.65 ± 0.3poly(dC)0.72 ± 0.3Mepoly(dC)2.00 ± 0.3The prefix Me indicates that the oligomer had been treated with MMS. Open table in a new tab The prefix Me indicates that the oligomer had been treated with MMS. Various methylated bases, nucleotides, and nucleosides were assayed as potential substrates for AlkB, including those with the 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine bases that are substrates for AlkB when incorporated into oligomeric DNA (TableII) (17Falnes P.O. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. Nature. 2002; 419: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 18Trewick S.C. Henshaw T.F. Hausinger R.P. Lindahl T. Sedgwick B. Nature. 2002; 419: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Incubation with 1-methyladenosine or 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine was found to induce up to a 7-fold increase in 2OG turnover. 3-Methylcytidine and 3-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine only brought about a 2- and 3-fold increase, respectively. This suggests that 1-methyladenine rather than 3-methylcytosine lesions may be preferred substrates for AlkB. An HPLC-based assay was developed to investigate the production of nucleosides from their methylated counterparts by AlkB. Neither analysis by photodiode array HPLC or by ESI-LCMS led to the detection of any demethylated nucleoside for the incubation of either 1-methyladenosine, 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, 3-methylcytidine, or 3-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine with AlkB. Thus, unlike the situation with oligomeric DNA the turnover of 2OG and hydroxylation of the prime substrate appear to be predominantly uncoupled in the presence of nucleoside substrate analogues. This is of interest with regard to substrate recognition by AlkB. Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and solution studies of other 2OG oxygenases have indicated that binding of the prime substrate to the enzyme complex is required to initiate dioxygen binding and subsequent reaction of 2OG (31Zhang Z.H. Ren J.S. Harlos K. McKinnon C.H. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 32Solomon E.I. Brunold T.C. Davis M.I. Kemsley J.N. Lee S.K.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4999-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It appears that 1-methyladenosine and 3-methylcytidine nucleosides are recognized by the AlkB active site and can stimulate reaction of 2OG with dioxygen, but the reactive oxidizing species, believed to be [FeIV=O ↔ FeIII–O⋅], does not react with the methyl group. It may be that when the requisite connections are not made to the DNA oligomer the reactive oxidized species is not positioned correctly to effect hydroxylation. To effect further 2OG catalysis the original FeII center must be regenerated by an alternative pathway possibly involving ascorbate (see below).Table IIThe effect on rate of 2OG turnover by AlkB incubated with various DNA bases, nucleosides, and nucleotidesSubstrates2OG turnoverpmol/sNo substrate1.75 ± 0.11-Methyladenosine12.25 ± 0.41-Methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine12.79 ± 0.5Adenosine1.39 ± 0.42′-Deoxyadenosine1.63 ± 0.21-Methyladenine5.27 ± 0.2Adenine1.70 ± 0.13-Methylcytidine3.57 ± 0.4>3-Methyl-2′-deoxycytidine4.98 ± 0.5Cytidine1.73 ± 0.22′-Deoxycytidine1.68 ± 0.2Cytosine1.15 ± 0.66-Amino-1-methyluracil1.01 ± 0.17-Methylguanosine1.67 ± 0.3N 6-Methyladenosine-5′-monophosphate1.49 ± 0.0N 2-Methylguanosine1.75 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab To further investigate the structural motifs recognized by AlkB, assays with 1-methyladenine and various non-methylated bases and nucleosides were carried out (Table II). The rate of 2OG turnover remained consistent at the level observed in the absence of substrate when AlkB was incubated with adenosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, or adenine,i.e. in the absence of the 1-methyl group. For both 1-methyladenine, 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, and 1-methyladenosine there was an increase in the rate of 2OG turnover, indicating that the 1-methyl group is an absolute requirement for stimulation of the reaction between 2OG and O2. 2OG conversion was lower for 1-methyladenine than for 1-methyladenosine and 1-methyl-2′-deoxyadenosine, indicating that the presence of a sugar moiety improves substrate recognition by AlkB, possibly by direct contacts between the enzyme and the sugar giving rise to tighter enzyme/substrate analogue binding. Similarly, cytidine, 2′-deoxycytidine and cytosine all failed to bring about an increase in the rate of 2OG conversion, indicating that AlkB activity is stimulated by binding the methyl group of 3-methylcytidine nucleosides. Stimulation of 2OG oxidation without coupling to hydroxylation of the prime substrate has previously been observed for procollagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase with substrate analogues (34Venkateswara Rao N. Adams E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6327-6330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, mutagenesis studies on deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase have resulted in an uncoupling of 2OG turnover and prime substrate hydroxylation (35Lipscomb S.J. Lee H.J. Mukherji M. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Lloyd M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2735-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For procollagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase the uncoupled oxidation of 2OG has been linked to the requirement for ascorbate as well as FeII and 2OG. It has been proposed that an ascorbate molecule regenerates the FeII center in the event of uncoupled turnover of 2OG to the ferryl intermediate and succinate (36Myllyla R. Majamaa K. Gunzler V. Hanauskeabel H.M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5403-5405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uncoupled 2OG turnover by AlkB was found to be highly dependent on ascorbate both in the presence and absence of 1-methyladenosine, but more so in the former case (Fig.2). However, the amount of ascorbate required for optimal uncoupled 2OG turnover was far in excess of stoichiometry to 2OG. The role of ascorbate was investigated further by attempting to replace it in the assay with alternative reducing agents (Table III). Activity was maintained withd -isoascorbate and dithiothreitol, the latter giving approximately 90% of the activity withl -ascorbate. All other agents tested resulted in a significant loss of activity, though when compared with the rate of reaction in the absence of reducing agent, β-mercaptoethanol gave a moderate increase in activity while addition of dithionite and 4-nitrocatechol brought about a reduction in rate.Table IIIThe effect on rate of 2OG turnover by AlkB brought about by replacing ascorbate in the assay with alternative reducing agentsReducing agent2OG turnoverpmol/sNo reducing agent1.32 ± 0.0l-Ascorbate11.75 ± 0.1d-Isoascorbate12.68 ± 0.4Dithiothreitol10.70 ± 1.2Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine1.51 ± 0.1Dithionite0.56 ± 0.0β-Mercaptoethanol1.98 ± 0.34-Nitrocatechol0.18 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab For prolyl-4-hydroxylase, in the presence of poly(l-proline) (a substrate that stimulates uncoupled 2OG turnover but is not hydroxylated) a stoichiometric reaction of 2OG with disappearance of ascorbate has been reported (36Myllyla R. Majamaa K. Gunzler V. Hanauskeabel H.M. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5403-5405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work on anthocyanidin synthase, a 2OG-dependent oxygenase involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants, has suggested that an ascorbate molecule may bind at the active site in the presence of the prime substrate and might be involved in catalysis (37Wilmouth R.C. Turnbull J.J. Welford R.W.D. Clifton I.J. Prescott A.G. Schofield C.J. Structure. 2002; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the exact role of ascorbate in AlkB catalysis will require further work. However, the observation that it can be replaced by dithiothreitol suggests that its role may not be entirely specific. During the course of this work it was found that 2OG concentrations greater than 200 μm caused a reduction in the initial rate of 2OG turnover (Fig.3). This inhibition was unaffected by an increase in FeII concentration, and the same pattern was observed at both 80 μm and 250 μmFeII. Therefore, AlkB inhibition at high 2OG concentrations is unlikely to be a result of FeII chelation by 2OG. The 2OG-dependent dioxygenases deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase and thymine-7-hydroxylase have also been observed to be inhibited by high concentrations of 2OG (33Holme E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4999-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Dubus A. Llyod M.D. Lee H.J. Schofield C.J. Baldwin J.E. Frere J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Enzyme inhibition by high substrate concentrations is often thought to be a result of two molecules of substrate binding to the enzyme to produce an inactive complex (39Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London2001: 121-122Google Scholar). It is possible, though unlikely, that inhibition of AlkB by 2OG has physiological significance. The inhibition of AlkB by high concentrations of 2OG prompted us to investigate the inhibition of AlkB by a variety of structural analogues of 2OG. The ability to selectively inhibit enzymes that repair alkylation damage to DNA could potentially allow a reduction in the amount of cytotoxic alkylating agents used in cancer chemotherapy. Various compounds were therefore assayed as inhibitors of AlkB (TableIV). N-Oxalylglycine differs from 2OG by the replacement of the 3-CH2 with an NH and has previously been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of both the procollagen (26Cunliffe C.J. Franklin T.J.

The 2 thiono derivative of N-oxalylglycine gave a similar IC50 of 0.81 mm. Both R- andS-enantiomers of N-oxalylalanine were then tested as inhibitors. Neither stereochemistry was found to be a good inhibitor with IC50 values of 2.4 and 3.3 mm for theS- and R-enantiomers, respectively, both significantly higher than that for N-oxalylglycine. This observation implies that space within the 2OG binding pocket of AlkB may be limited compared with some other 2OG oxygenases.N-Oxalyl-4S-alanine was also found to be a better inhibitor than the 4R of procollagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases (26Cunliffe C.J. Franklin T.J. Hales N.J. Hill G.B. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 2652-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Inhibitors in which the 2-keto of 2OG was replaced with a thiol or an alcohol were then tested. As these compounds lack the carbonyl group that reacts with dioxygen they are relatively resistant to nucleophilic attack by an activated dioxygen molecule. The C-2 thiol, (±)-2-mercaptoglutarate had the lowest IC50 (0.12 mm) of the 2OG analogues tested; in contrast the C-2 alcohol showed no inhibition up to a concentration of 4 mm. The significant difference between inhibition by the alcohol and the thiol is interesting and is possibly a result of the high affinity of the thiol for FeII. Changing the concentration of FeII had no effect on inhibition by (±)-2-mercaptoglutarate, indicating that simple solution-based FeII chelation was not responsible for inhibition. It is also noteworthy that, during catalysis by isopenicillin Nsynthase, an oxidase with a close structural relationship to the 2OG oxygenases, ligation of its thiol substrate (l)-δ-(α-aminoadipyl)-(l)-cysteinyl-(d)-valine to the FeII center is a key step in catalysis (40Roach P.L.

Thiols are present in a number of pharmaceuticals, therefore it may be of interest to pursue their use in attempts to prepare generic templates for inhibition of 2OG-dependent oxygenases.Table IVIC50 values and structures of the 2OG analogues tested as inhibitors of AlkB Open table in a new tab Recently, it has been proposed that the naturally occurring flavonoid quercetin, (a compound used in dietary supplements) can regulate the hypoxic response by inhibition of the HIF hydroxylases involved in the degradation of the HIF-1α protein (41Wilson W.J. Poellinger L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HIF-1α is hydroxylated by members of the FeII, 2OG-dependent dioxygenase family at an asparagine residue by FIH and two proline residues by the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes. Quercetin is a good iron chelator, and its regulatory role could in part be due to its effect on iron concentrations and consequently the activity of the FeIIdioxygenases. Under the standard AlkB assay conditions, quercetin was found to have an IC50 of 0.08 mm for inhibition of 2OG turnover by AlkB. However, AlkB activity could be returned to normal levels by addition of excess FeII (160 μm) (data not shown). This indicates that there is unlikely to be any specific and tight binding interaction between quercetin and AlkB. However it may still be possible to modulate the activity of AlkB using nonspecific iron chelators. For comparison the effect of quercetin on the asparagine hydroxylase FIH was also explored. Quercetin was found to inhibit FIH with an IC50 of 0.6 mm. Increasing the FeII concentration failed to return FIH activity to the normal rate, indicating a specific interaction between FIH and quercetin. The specificity of quercetin for FIH inhibition over that of AlkB could aid the design of inhibitors that specifically inhibit members of the 2OG-dependent family of dioxygenases involved in the hypoxic response or in repair of alkylated DNA. The inhibition of FIH by quercetin may also reflect a role for flavonoids in human metabolism, but to conclude such at present is premature.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP)1 monooxygenases are a superfamily of heme-thiolate enzymes that are involved in a wide array of NADPH/NADH- and O2-dependent reactions (1Guengerich F.P. MacDonald T.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2453-2459Google Scholar). There are currently more than 2000 family members, including a large number of putative P450 open reading frames found in fully sequenced prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes (drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html). Extensive studies have firmly established their role in the biosynthesis of sterols, fatty acids, and prostaglandins in animals, antibiotics, and other biologically active molecules in bacteria, fungi, and plants as well as in the metabolism of xenobiotic drugs and toxic chemicals (2Guengerich F.P. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2002; 1: 359-366Google Scholar). Accordingly, the extraordinary diversity in amino acid sequence enables wide variation in the substrates utilized and the patterns of oxidation catalyzed by these enzymes. A particularly rich source of CYPs is from Streptomycesspp., a group of developmentally complex, Gram-positive bacteria that are known for production of a broad array of biologically active secondary metabolites. Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has been investigated extensively as a model system for the study of morphological and physiological development of Streptomycesand for investigation of the genetic control of antibiotic production (3Hopwood D.A. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 2183-2202Google Scholar). Over the past decade, an increasing number ofStreptomyces spp. have been investigated because of their production of pharmaceutically important compounds including anti-cancer agents, immunosuppressants, and antibiotics. In addition,Streptomyces are being recognized as a source of versatile biocatalysts for the detoxification of hazardous chemicals (4Shelton D.R. Khader S. Karns J.S. Pogell B.M.

In an effort to analyze fully the complement of CYPs in the industrially important Streptomyces, we decided to focus on the 8.7 Mb S. coelicolor A3(2) genome whose sequence was recently completed by the Sanger Centre (10Bentley S.D.

Most of the currently identified antibiotics are produced by complex biosynthetic systems comprised of clustered gene sets located contiguously on the Streptomyces chromosome (12Xue Y. Zhao L.

A. 1999; 96: 9509-9514Google Scholar). These reactions typically occur during the late stages of biosynthesis after formation of the core ring system by a polyketide synthase. The hydroxyl or epoxide substituents provide an important layer of structural variability into the final natural product structures and often significantly influence biological activity (12Xue Y.

Our current study was motivated by the intriguing amino acid sequence relationship between a number of S. coelicolor A3(2) CYPs that show significant similarity with P450 monooxygenases from other microorganisms involved in regio-specific oxidation of macrolide antibiotics. Among eight crystal structures reported for cytochrome P450 over the last 17 years, only one has been reported for a macrolide hydroxylase (P450 EryF from Saccharopolyspora erythraea) (37Cupp-Vickery J.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 144-153Google Scholar). EryF is involved in hydroxylation of C-6 of the 14-membered ring macrolactone 6-deoxyerythronolide B in the erythromycin biosynthetic pathway.

Two protein molecules are present in the asymmetric unit. The quality of the final structure (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III) was assessed with the program PROCHECK (41Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). For the first molecule, 90.17 of residues were found in the most-favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and 9.97 were found in the allowed regions. For the second molecule, 91.77 of residues were found in the most-favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and 9.37 were found in the allowed regions. YC-17-induced (43Djerassi C. Zderic J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1956; 78: 6390-6395Google Scholar) and narbomycin-induced (44Djerassi C. Halpern O. Tetrahedron. 1958; 3: 255-268Google Scholar) spectral shifts were monitored at 23.5 °C by using a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer. The sample contained 1 ml of 5 ॖmCYP154C1 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 107 glycerol. YC-17 and narbomycin were dissolved in ethanol at a stock concentration of 25 mm. Spectral binding assay was carried out by difference spectra with the addition of substrate dissolved in ethanol to the sample cuvette and ethanol to the reference cuvette by 2-ॖl aliquots. The assays were performed by using eight YC-17 or narbomycin concentrations ranging from 50 to 390 ॖm. The data were linearized in the form of the S0/ΔA versus S0 plot, whereS0 is a total concentration of substrate in the reaction mixture. The difference in absorbance between 384 nm (peak) and 418 nm (trough) for each spectrum was taken as the ΔAof the reaction. Kd was estimated from the intercept of the linear plot on the S0 axis. The CYP154C1 and PikC conversion of YC17 or narbomycin was compared using a modification of the assay developed for PikC (19Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 1 ॖm enzyme, 3.5 mm spinach ferredoxin, 0.1 unit of spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, 1 mm NADPH, and ∼500 ॖm YC17 or narbomycin in a total volume of 1 ml of conversion buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 107 glycerol). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by extraction with ethyl acetate (3 × 1 ml). The extracts were combined, dried, and resuspended in 100 ॖl of ethyl acetate. The extracts were compared with purified compounds using silica TLC developed with chloroform:methanol:NH4OH (9:1:0.1) and stained with vanillin. CYP154C1(Q9L142; accession numbers are according to SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL Protein Knowledgebase, tw.expasy.org/sprot/) is one of the 18 cytochromes P450 revealed in theS. coelicolor A3(2) genome (10Bentley S.D.

The closest homolog of CYP154C1 identified in the data base using program BLAST (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) is a cytochrome P450 CYP154B1 from Streptomyces fradiae with 447 sequence identity (Q9XCC6) localized within the tylosin biosynthetic gene cluster (13Bate N. Butler A.R. Gandecha A.R. Cundliffe E. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 617-624Google Scholar). However, because macrolactone ring hydroxylations at C-20 and C-23 that occur during tylosin biosynthesis are catalyzed by the products of different genes, one of which encodes another cytochrome P450, CYP105L1 (Q9ZHQ1) (14Fouces R. Mellado E. Diez B. Barredo J.L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 855-868Google Scholar), the role of the CYP154C1 homolog in S. fradiae remains unknown. CYPs with lower identity include the second member of CYP154 family in S. coelicolor A3(2), CYP154A1 (Q9KZR7) (with 427 identity), as well as CYP107B1 (B42606) and EryF, or CYP107A1 (Q00441), from S. erythraea (both with 377 identity and 54 and 517 homology, respectively). There are also a number of P450s from different Streptomyces species having about 367 identity, including CYP107C1 from S. thermotolerans (Q60005), CYP107L1 (PikC) from Streptomyces venezuelae (O87605), PTED from Streptomyces avermitilis (Q93H80), and CYP107D1 (OLEP) from Streptomyces antibioticus (Q59819). This last group of related P450s is known to be involved in modification of macrolide antibiotics such as carbomycin (46Arisawa A. Tsunekawa H. Okamura K. Okamoto R. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 582-588Google Scholar), methymycin, neomethymycin, pikromycin (19Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Google Scholar, 21Graziani E.I. Cane D.E.

Omura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9509-9514Google Scholar), and oleandomycin (24Rodriguez A.M. Olano C. Mendez C. Hutchinson C.R. Salas J.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 127: 117-120Google Scholar). Two S. erythraea enzymes, CYP107B1 and EryF (467 identical to each other) show the same level of identity to CYP154C1 fromS. coelicolor A3(2) (Fig. 1). Having 467 identity, the enzymes have different enzymatic activity. Specifically, EryF catalyzes C-6 hydroxylation of the 6-deoxyerythronolide B (Scheme FS1) in the biosynthesis of erythromycin (47Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Google Scholar). CYP107B1 shows no detectable activity toward 6-deoxyerythronolide B (48Andersen J.F. Hutchinson C.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 725-735Google Scholar), and its function remains unknown. Interestingly, CYP107B1 has 517 identity and 657 homology with the PikC from S. venezuelae (Fig. 1A). Previous studies have revealed that PikC has remarkable substrate flexibility. It is capable of accepting 12- and 14-membered ring macrolides as substrates and catalyzes conversion of the 12-membered ring macrolide intermediate YC-17 to methymycin, neomethymycin (12Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Google Scholar, 19Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem.

Sherman D.H. J. Nat. Prod. 2001; 64: 1447-1450Google Scholar). PikC also converts the 14-membered ring macrolide narbomycin to pikromycin (12Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Google Scholar, 19Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Google Scholar, 21Graziani E.I. Cane D.E. Betlach M.C. Kealey J.T.

CYP154C1 lies on the chromosome adjacent to CYP157A1 in an operon that does not contain polyketide synthases or nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene sequences. Adjacent sequences include a sensor kinase, two open reading frames of unknown function, and an ATP-binding protein. The expression of this operon and the function of CYP154C1 may be related to secondary metabolism through a regulatory cascade induced by an environmental stress or to modification of xenobiotics. Sequence similarity of CYP154C1 with monooxygenases involved in tailoring of macrolide antibiotics (Fig. 1A) led us to investigate its catalytic activity toward these important compounds. Thus, the protein was tested against 12- and 14-membered ring macrolide intermediates YC-17 and narbomycin, which are converted to methymycin, neomethymycin, novamethymycin, and pikromycin by PikC inS. venezuelae (12Xue Y. Zhao L. Liu H.W. Sherman D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12111-12116Google Scholar, 19Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Google Scholar, 20Xue Y.

Interestingly, CYP154C1 showed catalytic activity toward both substrates. The reaction with the 14-membered ring macrolide narbomycin was notably faster and resulted in a more complete conversion to pikromycin compared with conversion of the 12-membered ring macrolide, YC-17. However, transformation of YC-17 was accomplished with notable position selectivity at the C12 position, leading predominantly to neomethymycin. This substrate selectivity is in marked contrast to PikC, which converts YC-17 with equal efficiency to methymycin and neomethymycin (19Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Google Scholar). CYP154C1 binds YC-17 and narbomycin with similar affinity (Kd = 405 and 403 ॖm, respectively), producing type I binding spectra resulting from expulsion of a water molecule from the iron coordination sphere followed by"

Initial phosphorylation of RB and titration of the CDK inhibitors expedites the activation of the cyclin E/CDK2 kinase, thereby completing RB phosphorylation and inactivation prior to initiation of DNA replication.Initiation of DNA replication at the G1/S phase boundary is meticulously regulated to ensure the cell has assembled the appropriate machinery needed for high fidelity genome duplication. Prior to S phase entry, pre-replication complexes (pre-RC) form at replication origins during G1 phase. Origins are first marked by the origin recognition complex (ORC), which is composed of six subunits (ORC1–6) (3Bell S.P. Stillman B.

Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1053-1061Google Scholar), RB also directly associates with the pre-RC through MCM7 (18Sterner J.M. Dew-Knight S. Musahl C. Kornbluth S. Horowitz J.M. Mol.

The identification of glycosylated antigens within the M. tuberculosis complex raises the possibility that the carbohydrate moiety of these glycoproteins might be involved in pathogenesis, either by interaction with mannose receptors on host cells, or as targets or modulators of the cell-mediated immune response. Given such a possibility characterization of mycobacterial glycoproteins is a step toward understanding their functional role and elucidating the mechanisms of mycobacterial glycosylation. Mycobacterium tuberculosis andMycobacterium bovis, the causative agents of human and bovine tuberculosis, have been reported to express a range of surface and secreted glycoproteins, although only one of these has been subjected to detailed structural analysis. We describe the use of a genetic system, in conjunction with lectin binding, to characterize the points of attachment of carbohydrate moieties to the polypeptide backbone of a second mycobacterial glycoprotein, antigen MPB83 fromM. bovis.

In contrast, the number of reports of this post-translational modification by prokaryotes is comparatively low. Examples of eubacterial glycoproteins identified to date include cell surface or secreted proteins of pathogens that have antigenic properties and play a role in host pathogen interaction (1Virji M.

Removal of a sero-specific glycosyl moiety from the flagellin of Campylobacter jejuni has been reported to alter the O antigenicity of the organism (9Doig P. Kinsella N. Guerry P. Trust T.J. Mol.

Immun. 1999; 67: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that removal of covalently bound mannose from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen MPT32 reduced by 10-fold its ability to elicit a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in guinea pigs immunized withMycobacterium bovis BCG. M. tuberculosis and M. bovis are closely related members of the “M. tuberculosis complex” (MTb complex) that secrete a series of immunodominant antigens that have been reported to be glycosylated, on the basis of their ability to bind lectins such as concanavalin A (ConA)1 (12Espitia C.

Structural confirmation of protein glycosylation by mycobacteria was provided by detailed chemical compositional analysis of MPT32, a 45/47-kDa secreted antigen of M. tuberculosis (15Dobos K.M.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2498-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Mannose, mannobiose, and mannotriose substituents were found O-linked to four threonine residues on the protein backbone. Also, site-directed mutagenesis of the 19-kDa lipoprotein antigen of M. tuberculosis implicated threonine residues in ConA binding, consistent with the observed O-linked glycosylation (17Herrmann J.L. O'Gaora P. Gallagher A. Thole J.E. Young D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3547-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On the basis of monoclonal antibody-binding studies, Fifiset al. (13Fifis T. Costopoulos C. Radford A.J. Bacic A. Wood P.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 800-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that the 25/23-kDa secreted antigen of M. bovis was a glycosylated form of the major M. bovis antigen MPB70. They suggested that the increases in molecular weight, relative to the 22,000 MPB70, were attributable to glycosylation with mannose, as treatment of these antigens with α-mannosidase resulted in a reduction in their relative molecular weight. Subsequently, we demonstrated the presence of a gene,mpb83, which encodes a protein with 61% identity at the amino acid level to MPB70 (18Hewinson R.G. Michell S.L. Russell W.P. McAdam R.A. Jacobs W.J. Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 43: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the same study, the protein encoded for by this gene, MPB83, was shown to bind a monoclonal antibody specific for the 25/23-kDa M. bovis antigen. Thus, the 25/23-kDa antigen characterized by Fifis et al. (13Fifis T. Costopoulos C. Radford A.J. Bacic A. Wood P.R. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 800-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is MPB83, rather than a glycosylated form of MPB70. M. bovis expresses high levels of both MPB70 and MPB83 and these proteins are strongly recognized by the immune system duringM. bovis infection in cattle and badgers (19O'Loan C.J. Pollock J.M. Hanna J. Neill S.D. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1994; 1: 608-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Goodger J. Nolan A. Russell W.P. Dalley D.J. Thorns C.J. Croston P. Newell D.G. Vet. Rec. 1994; 135: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the proteins are expressed only at low levels in M. tuberculosis when grown in vitro, they are highly immunogenic during infection with live bacteria in mice (18Hewinson R.G. Michell S.L. Russell W.P. McAdam R.A. Jacobs W.J. Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 43: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and man (21Roche P.W. Triccas J.A. Avery D.T. Fifis T. Billman-Jacobe H. Britton W.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1994; 170: 1326-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition, vaccination of mice with a plasmid encoding MPB83 has been shown to confer significant protection against challenge withM. bovis (22Chambers M.A. Vordermeier H. Whelan A. Commander N. Tascon R. Lowrie D. Hewinson R.G. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2000; 30: S283-S287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, given its strong recognition by the immune system, further characterization of MPB83 is required. Open reading frames with homology to MPB70 and MPB83 can be identified in genome sequences from Streptomyces coelicolorand other microbes, but a physiological function has yet to be ascribed to these proteins. The aims of this study were to explore the glycosylation status of MPB83 and MPB70, to map specific sites for glycosylation within the molecules, and to elucidate the chemical structure of the carbohydrate moiety. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches we have demonstrated that MPB83 but not MPB70 is glycosylated, and that glycosylation occurs via attachment of short (1→3)-linked mannose chains to two threonine residues. Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 expressing PhoA hybrid proteins were grown in Luria broth, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, or in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with albumin, dextrose, catalase (MADC), and 0.05% Tween 80, 200 μg/ml hygromycin, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase activity of E. coli and mycobacterial PhoA recombinants was determined by the presence of blue colonies when plated on L agar (containing appropriate hygromycin concentrations) supplemented with 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate-p-toluidine (Sigma). The genes encoding MPB70, MPB83, and those regions of MPB83 used for deletion mapping, were amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides described in TableI. Oligonucleotides were supplied by Oswel, Southampton, United Kingdom. PCR amplifications were carried out in a DNA thermal cycler (Biometra) using 0.5 units of clonedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PCR reactions were performed in 50-μl volumes containing: 50 mm-KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm of each dinucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), and 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer overlaid with mineral oil. The parameters for amplification were one denaturation cycle at 96 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 96 °C for 1.5 min, hybridization at 56 °C for 1.5 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1.5 min. A final extension at 72 °C for 5 min was also performed.Table IOligonucleotides used for fragment amplificationOligonucleotideNo.Sequence70 PF15′-ACGGGTACCATGAAGGTAAAGAACACAAT70 PR25′-TGAGGATCCCGCCGGAGGCATTAGCACGC83 PF35′-ACGGGTACCATGATCAACGTTCAGGCCAA83 PR45′-TGAGGATCCCTGTGCCGGGGGCATCAGCA28 aa-83 PR55′-TGAGGATCCGGTGCTCGAACAACCCGCTA35 aa-83 PR65′-TGAGGATCCGGTGTCTTGCGACACGGGTT56 aa-83 PR75′-TGAGGATCCTGCGGGGTCAGCCATTGCCG65 aa-83 PR85′-TGAGGATCCCCCACGACCAATCAGGTCCGTT(48,49)VV PF95′-GCCCGGCGGCGCCCGTTGTAGTAGCGGCAATGGCTGTT(48,49)VV PR105′-CAGCCATTGCCGCTACTACAACGGGCGCCGCCGGGCThe restriction endonuclease sites are underlined and the site-directed mutations are shown in bold.

Michell S.L. Russell W.P. McAdam R.A. Jacobs W.J. Scand. J. Immunol. 1996; 43: 490-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), using the oligonucleotide pairs 1,2 and 3,4, respectively (Table I). Amplified fragments were purified using Wizard PCR Prep columns (Promega) and digested with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and KpnI (Promega). Digested fragments were cloned into BamHI/KpnI-digested p19pro-PhoA (Fig. 1), a modified version of pSMT3(19-PhoA) (17Herrmann J.L. O'Gaora P. Gallagher A. Thole J.E. Young D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3547-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) containing a leaderless E. coli alkaline phosphatase (phoA) gene, using standard procedures (Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar)). p19proSP-PhoA contains the promoter and signal peptide of the 19 kDa of M. tuberculosis in-frame with the PhoA gene in 19pro-PhoA and is used as a positive control for anti-alkaline phosphatase antibody activity and as a negative control for ConA binding. Truncated versions of mpb83 were amplified using oligonucleotide 83PF with the corresponding reverse complementary oligonucleotide and cloned into p19pro-PhoA as described above. Recombinants with functional alkaline phosphatase activity were selected after transformation into competent E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen), by the presence of blue colonies when grown onl-agar supplemented with 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate-p-toluidine. Plasmid DNA was isolated (Qiagen) and subsequently transformed into M. smegmatis mc2155 according to the method of Snapperet al. (24Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar).Figure 1Maps of plasmids used in this study.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Complementary forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers 9 and 10 (Table I) were used in conjunction with the reverse complementary and forward oligonucleotide primers, 4 and 3 (Table I), for mpb83, respectively. Following purification, the two products, having an overlap of 30 bp, were combined and amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 3 and 8 to give a fragment of mpb83 incorporating the desired mutation. All cloned DNA fragments were DNA sequenced using the TaqFS dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit in conjunction with a 373A Automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Each nucleotide was sequenced a minimum of three times from both strands. DNA sequence data analysis and protein sequence comparison were performed using the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR Inc.). For SDS-PAGE, recombinantM. smegmatis was grown in 40 ml of MADC-Tween 80 at 37 °C, 225 rpm, for 48 h. The mycobacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (4,000 rpm for 10 min, Sigma 3K10, rotor 11133), washed twice with 40 ml of PBS (pH 7.0), and resuspended in 3 ml of PBS (pH 7.0). The resulting suspensions were sonicated on ice 10 times for 60 s with 90-s intervals, using a Soniprep 150 (MSE Ltd) equipped with a 1-cm probe. Sonicated extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was isolated and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Total protein concentrations of sonicated extracts were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce and Warriner). 10 μg of extracts were solubilized by heating at 100 °C for 3 min in an equal volume of sample loading buffer {5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Samples were fractionated by electrophoresis through 12.5% acrylamide (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a discontinuous Tris-HCl buffer system as described by Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting as described previously (26Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rainbow protein markers (Amersham Biosciences) were run as molecular mass standards. ConA binding was determined by first blocking the nitrocellulose membranes with 20 ml of 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the membranes three times for 10 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, they were incubated with 20 ml of peroxidase-conjugated ConA at 1 mg/ml in PBS, 0.5% Tween 20 without bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed twice for 10 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and finally for 10 min with PBS only. The substrate solution for visualizing peroxidase activity was prepared by dissolving 30 mg of 4-chloronaphthol (Sigma) in 12 ml of methanol followed by addition of 96 ml of PBS and 17 μl of 30% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide. For detecting PhoA protein expression or MPB83, the membranes were blocked with 0.01 m Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder (TBSM), and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following three 10-min washes with TBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST) the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with monoclonal antibody raised against bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) or MBS43 (VLA Weybridge), both at a dilution of 1 in 8000 in 30 ml of TBST containing 3% (w/v) skimmed milk (TBSTM). Membranes were then washed in TBST as described previously and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) diluted 1 in 8000 in TBSTM. After three further 10-min washes at room temperature with TBS bound alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody was detected with SigmaFast tablets (Sigma) dissolved in 15 ml of water. Native MPB83 was purified from a M. bovis culture supernatant. M. bovis AN5 was grown as a surface pellicle on Bureau of Animal Industry medium (14 g of l-asparagine, 1.5 g of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.74 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of magnesium sulfate, 0.3 g of ferric sulfate, 0.08 g of zinc sulfate, 0.008 g of manganese chloride, 0.00138 g of cobaltous chloride, 10 g of glucose, 100 g of glycerol/liter) for 10 weeks at 37 °C. The culture was filtered through a stainless steel mesh strainer and then passed through a 0.2-μm VacuCap bottle top filter (Gelman Sciences). The culture supernatant was filtered a second time though a 0.2-μm VacuCap bottle top filter to ensure sterility. The culture supernatant was diluted 3-fold in preparative anion exchange chromatography (AEC) loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.05% (v/v) Igepal CA-630) and applied to a XK50/20 column (Amersham Biosciences) containing 200 ml of Fast Flow DEAE anion exchange medium (Amersham Biosciences) using a fast protein liquid chromatography instrument. Adsorbed protein was eluted from the column by applying a linear increasing gradient of 0–250 mmsodium chloride over a 1-liter volume. Fractions containing MPB83 were identified by separation on SDS-PAGE gels, transfer to nitrocellulose, and probing with the MPB83-specific antibody MBS43 using a Western blotting procedure. The purity of each MPB83 containing fraction was assessed by total protein analysis of SDS-PAGE gels using a silver stain procedure. Fractions containing MPB83 were pooled and concentrated using a 50-ml stirred cell concentrator containing a YM10 membrane (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) (Millipore UK). The enriched MPB83 containing material was further purified by high resolution AEC using a MonoQ HR10/10 column. The sample was diluted 5-fold in AEC loading buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8) and applied to a MonoQ HR10/10 column using a fast protein liquid chromatography instrument. The adsorbed material was eluted from the column by applying a linear increasing gradient of 0–250 mm sodium chloride over a 100-ml volume. Fractions containing MPB83 were identified as described above. The pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using a CentriPrep 10 (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) concentrator unit (Millipore UK) centrifuged at 2500 ×g (MSE Mistrial 2000 centrifuge, Sanyo Gallenkamp). The AEC purified material was diluted 5-fold in hydrophobic interaction chromatography loading buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 1 m ammonium sulfate) and applied to a HR5/5 phenyl-Superose hydrophobic interaction chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) using a fast protein liquid chromatography instrument. Adsorbed material was eluted by applying a linear, decreasing gradient, of 1–0 m ammonium sulfate over a volume of 80 ml. Fractions containing MPB83 were identified as described above. The pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon 10 (10,000 M r cut-off) concentrator units (Millipore UK) centrifuged at 4000 × g (MSE Mistral 2000 centrifuge, Sanyo Gallenkamp). The concentrated material was dialyzed against 4× 2 liters of PBS using a 3,500M r cut-off dialysis cassette (Perbio Science). Dialysis was performed at 4 °C and a minimum of 2 h was allowed between each change of dialysis buffer. The dialyzed material was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein estimation assay. Purified native MPB83 was subjected to a chemical deglycosylation procedure using a GlycoFree deglycosylation kit (Glyko Inc.). This method employs the use of anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, which cleavesN- and O-linked glycans nonselectively from glycoproteins while leaving the primary structure of the protein intact (27Sojar H.T. Bahl O.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Purified native MPB83 was initially desalted by dialysis against 4× 2-liter volumes of water using a 3,500 M rcut-off dialysis cassette (Perbio Science). The desalted sample was then frozen at −80 °C and lyophilized overnight in a model EF03 freeze dryer (Edwards High Vacuum International). The deglycosylation procedure was then performed in accordance with the GlycoFree kit recommendations. Briefly, a reaction vial, containing 0.5 mg of lyophilized material, was placed in a dry ice/ethanol bath and 50 μl of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was slowly added. The vial was then incubated at −20 °C for 4 h and then returned to a dry ice/ethanol bath, to which 150 μl of pyridine was slowly added. The vial was then transferred to dry ice for a further 5 min and then to wet ice for a further 15 min. The reaction mixture was neutralized by addition of 400 μl of 0.5% (w/v) ammonium bicarbonate. The deglycosylated protein was then isolated from the reaction products and reagents by dialysis against 4× 2 liters of PBS using a 3,500M r cut-off dialysis cassette (Perbio Science). The protein concentration of the dialyzed material was determined using the BCA protein estimation assay. Intact MPB83 and products of tryptic digestion were analyzed by ES-MS using a nanospray ion source on a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time of flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Micromass UK) (28Morris H.R.

Signals attributable to glycopeptides were passed separately for collisionally activated decomposition tandem MS experiments (CAD MS/MS) into a collision cell filled with argon gas, using collision energies from 10 to 40 eV as appropriate (28Morris H.R.

The modifying sugars of purified MPB83 were identified by first hydrolyzing the protein (50 μg) with 4m trifluoroacetic acid at 95 °C for 4 h to release the sugars. The hydrolysis reaction was dried under vacuum at 40 °C in a SCV100H SpeedVac apparatus (Stratech Scientific) and then resuspended in 100 μl of water. A sample of 10 μl was then analyzed on a CarboPak PA1 anion exchange column (Dionex Corp.) using a 625LC high performance liquid chromatography instrument (Waters) equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector (Dionex Corp.). Sugars were eluted from the column with 16 mm sodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Sugars were identified by comparing the column retention time with that of sugar standards prepared at known concentrations run under identical conditions (all sugar standards were supplied by Sigma). Reductive elimination, permethylation, preparation of partially methylated alditol acetates, and acquisition of FAB-MS and GC-MS data were performed as described previously (30Dell A. Reason A.J.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used to determine whether MPB70 and MPB83 were glycosylated by mycobacteria. The genes encoding these proteins were cloned in-frame with E. coli alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) lacking its own signal sequence in the mycobacterial shuttle vector 19pro-PhoA (Fig. 1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PhoA was used as a hybrid partner to allow the level of expression of the different constructs to be monitored and to verify that the fusion proteins were being exported. The fusion proteins encoded by these constructs expressed functionally active alkaline phosphatase in both E. coli DH5α andM. smegmatis mc2155, as determined by the formation of blue colonies in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate-p-toluidine. Glycosylation of the fusion proteins was monitored by their ability to bind ConA following fractionation of recombinant cell extracts by denaturing SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes. In these experiments only MPB83-PhoA expressed by M. smegmatismc2155 was recognized by ConA (Fig.2 A, lane 5). ConA did not bind MPB83-PhoA expressed by E. coli DH5α (Fig.2 A, lane 4), demonstrating that post-translational modification of MPB83 is restricted to the mycobacterial host. Neither the MPB70-PhoA fusion protein nor the PhoA protein alone expressed by M. smegmatis mc2155 bound ConA (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 6, respectively). Probing a duplicate blot with antibody directed against PhoA (Fig. 2 B) demonstrated a similar amount of hybrid protein in each of the extracts, indicating that differences in ConA binding were not a consequence of differences in expression levels of the recombinant fusion proteins. There was evidence of partial proteolysis of fusion proteins expressed in M. smegmatismc2155 as two bands reacting with anti-PhoA antibody were observed.Figure 2Binding of ConA to MPB83 when expressed by mycobacteria.

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) binds directly to eNOS, augmenting NO production. We have used purified proteins to characterize further the mechanism by which HSP90 increases eNOS activity at low (100 nm) and high (10 μm) Ca2+levels. In the presence of calmodulin (CaM), HSP90 increased eNOS activity dose dependently at both low and high Ca2+concentrations. This effect was abolished by the specific HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) at both calcium concentrations. The EC50 values of eNOS for both Ca2+ and CaM were decreased in the presence of HSP90. HSP90 also significantly increased the rate of NADPH-dependent cytochrome creduction by eNOS at both low and high Ca2+ concentrations. HSP90 bound to eNOS in a dose-dependent manner, and the amount of bound HSP90 also increased with increasing Ca2+/CaM. At 100 nm Ca2+, HSP90 promoted dose-dependent CaM binding to eNOS that was fully inhibitable by GA. At high calcium, HSP90 did not affect CaM binding to eNOS, but GA inhibited HSP90 binding to eNOS. At high Ca2+, HSP90 caused the V max of eNOS forl-arginine to increase by 2-fold, but theK m of eNOS was unchanged. HSP90 bound preferentially to CaM-prebound eNOS and significantly increased both its NO synthesis and reductase activities. These data support that HSP90 promotes eNOS activity by two mechanisms: (i) a CaM-dependent mechanism operative at low Ca2+concentrations, characterized by an increase in the affinity of eNOS for CaM and (ii) a CaM-independent mechanism apparent at high Ca2+ concentrations, characterized by stimulation of eNOS reductase activity without further change in CaM binding. These studies contribute to our understanding of eNOS activation by HSP90 and provide a basis for in vitro studies of other eNOS-interacting proteins.

Endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), the highly regulated enzyme responsible for physiological production of NO in the vasculature, is primarily a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent enzyme. However, recent studies have revealed additional regulation of eNOS activity by subcellular localization, post-translational modification such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and interactions with several regulatory proteins, including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) (2Govers R. Rabelink T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F193-F206Google Scholar, 3Fleming I. Busse R. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 532-541Google Scholar, 4Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Google Scholar). HSP90 increases the activity of eNOS in vitro, and stimulation of endothelial cells with various stimuli such as vascular endothelial growth factor, histamine, estrogen, and fluid shear stress increases an association of HSP90 with eNOS, resulting in elevation of NO production (4Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Google Scholar, 5Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Caulin-Glaser T. Rosneck J. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. J. Biol.

HSP90 has no effect on eNOS dissociation from caveolin in the absence of Ca2+/CaM but facilitates CaM-induced eNOS release from eNOS-caveolin (7Gratton J.-P. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Google Scholar). Recently, the domains of eNOS and HSP90 necessary for their interaction were identified (8Harris M.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Google Scholar) showed that HSP90 association with eNOS is a prerequisite for subsequent Akt-mediated stimulation of eNOS. Together with the data that HSP90 directly interacts with Akt (10Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Google Scholar), their results suggest that HSP90 might be a scaffold factor between eNOS and Akt. Accumulating data have indicated that HSP90 plays a crucial role in regulating eNOS activity in endothelial cells. However, the mechanism by which HSP90 directly promotes eNOS activity has remained unclear. Many studies have suggested the existence of so-called “Ca2+-independent” activation of eNOS, although it is well established that Ca2+-activated CaM is necessary for eNOS activity (11Forstermann U. Pollock J.S. Schmidt H.H. Heller M. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1788-1792Google Scholar, 12Busse R. Mülsch A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 133-136Google Scholar). It was reported that fluid shear stress and estrogen increase NO production without mobilizing cytosolic Ca2+ in endothelial cells (13Kuchan M.J. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C628-C636Google Scholar, 14Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Google Scholar, 15Ayajiki K. Kindermann M. Hecker M. Fleming I. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 750-758Google Scholar) and that HSP90 might mediate their effects on eNOS (4Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Google Scholar, 5Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Caulin-Glaser T. Rosneck J. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5026-5030Google Scholar). As observed in eNOS phosphorylated by protein kinases such as Akt (at Ser-1177 and -1179 for human and bovine eNOS, respectively) (16Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K.

Biol. 1991; 9: 845-848Google Scholar), these results raised the possibility that HSP90 also participates in Ca2+-independent activation of eNOS. Whether Ca2+-independent activation of eNOS can be induced by HSP90 is also a critical question that needs to be addressed. Therefore, the present study was designated to clarify the mechanism of the stimulatory effect of HSP90 on eNOS activity including Ca2+/CaM requirement. The enzymes, antibodies, and reagents used in this study and their sources are as follows: bovine brain HSP90, CHAPS, Dowex AG50WX8, tetrahydrobiopterin, NADPH, FAD, FMN,l-NAME, l-arginine, cytochrome c, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Sigma); recombinant chicken CaM, geldanamycin (GA), and protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA); anti-eNOS antibody N30020 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-HSP90 antibody SPA830, (Stressgen, Victoria, BC); anti-CaM antibody and protein G-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); secondary antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase, ECL Western blotting detection reagents, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose 4B, CaM-Sepharose 4B, and HiTrap Q (AmershamBiosciences); Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA); BENCH MARK prestained protein ladder (Invitrogen); polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA); calcium calibration buffer kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR);l-[2,3,4-3H]arginine (45–70 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). HSP90 was reconstituted in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μm ATP, and 1 mm MgCl2. All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Recombinant bovine wild-type eNOS, expressed in Sf9 cells, was purified from the lysate by sequential chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose and CaM according to the method of List et al. (19List B.M. Klosch B. Volker C. Gorren A.C. Sessa W.C. Werner E.R. Kukovetz W.R. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 159-165Google Scholar). The eNOS was further purified by HiTrap Q chromatography with a linear gradient of 0.1–1m NaCl. The eNOS protein was stored at −80 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EGTA. Protein concentration was determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard. In the case of preparing CaM-bound eNOS, purified eNOS was incubated with 1 mm Ca2+ and 300 nm CaM on ice for 30 min and then loaded to a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column. Following washes, CaM-bound eNOS was eluted with 10 mm NADPH. NOS activity was measured as the conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline as described by Bredt and Snyder (20Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Google Scholar). Free calcium concentrations were calculated at pH 7.5 and 100 mm NaCl with K D(Ca2+-EGTA) of 27.9 nm at 37 °C, and the desired concentrations were achieved by mixing EGTA and Ca2+-EGTA (21Tsien R. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Google Scholar). eNOS (9.8 nm) was preincubated with HSP90 at room temperature for 5 min, because the 5-min treatment reached the maximal effect of HSP90 (data not shown). In some experiments, HSP90 was treated with 1 μm GA. eNOS was then mixed with the reaction buffer consisting of 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NADPH, 20 μm FAD, 20 μm FMN, 20 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, and 300 nm CaM in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+. NOS reaction was initiated by adding 100 μml-[3H]arginine (1 μCi), and incubation was done at 37 °C for 10 min unless otherwise stated. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 5.5) buffer containing 2 mm EGTA and 2 mm EDTA. l-[3H]citrulline was separated through a Dowex AG50WX8 (Na+-form) column and then counted on a liquid scintillation analyzer.l-NAME-inhibitable activity was determined as specific eNOS activity. Cytochromec reductase activity was determined photometrically according to previously reported methods (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar) with minor modifications. eNOS (9.8 nm) was mixed with HSP90 (45 nm) in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ in reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm CHAPS, 200 μm cytochrome c, and 300 nm CaM. SOD was added at 1 unit. The reductase reaction was initiated by adding 100 μm NADPH, and then change in absorbance at 550 nm was measured at 23 °C for 3 min. The rate of reduction was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 0.021 μm−1 cm−1 for cytochromec at 550 nm. eNOS (9.8 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in the NOS reaction buffer in the presence of EGTA or Ca2+ after eNOS was preincubated with HSP90 at room temperature for 5 min. eNOS complex was then immunoprecipitated by anti-eNOS antibody (1:100–200) and successively by protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C. Following washes with the corresponding buffer, the immunoprecipitates were suspended in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated with the primary antibody against eNOS (1:1000), HSP90 (1:1000), or CaM (1:500) and then probed with the secondary antibody linked to peroxidase. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized on x-ray films with chemiluminescent ECL reagents. The intensity of each band was measured by a densitometer and normalized to the corresponding eNOS. Relative intensity to the defined group as described in each figure legend was calculated. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student's ttest. EC50, K m andV max values were obtained from the direct fits to the data according to Hill equation on SigmaPlot 2001 software.p value of <0.05 was regarded as significant. Recombinant bovine eNOS was purified to near homogeneity by sequential chromatographic steps (Fig.1 A, inset). The protein in our preparation was recognized by anti-eNOS antibody, but immunoblotting of the preparation with anti-HSP90 and anti-CaM antibodies were both negative (data not shown). We examined the effects of HSP90 on eNOS activity in the presence of CaM at several calcium concentrations (Fig. 1 A). Depletion of free Ca2+(<1 nm) was achieved by addition of 10 mm EGTA to the reaction. eNOS activity was negligible under these conditions, and HSP90 was unable to stimulate eNOS activity in the presence of EGTA. Presence of low (100 nm) or high (10 μm) Ca2+ caused activation of eNOS (2.2 ± 0.4 and 13.6 ± 0.6 nmol/min/nmol of protein at 100 nm and 10 μm Ca2+, respectively), which was in both cases significant in comparison to the Ca2+-free control. HSP90 also significantly augmented eNOS activity under both low and high calcium conditions. The increases in eNOS activity at 100 nm and 10 μmCa2+ due to HSP90 were 7.2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, compared with the corresponding HSP90-free control. GA, a relatively specific inhibitor of HSP90, had no effect on Ca2+-activated eNOS activity by itself but completely inhibited the eNOS-stimulatory effects of HSP90 at both low and high calcium concentrations. The eNOS reactions at low and high calcium concentrations proceeded linearly up to 20 min both in the absence and presence of HSP90 (Fig. 1 B), supporting that eNOS in the absence of HSP90 is not denatured and that the HSP90 effect is likely due to actions other than protection against thermal denaturation. HSP90 promoted an increase in Ca2+-activated eNOS activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.2). The absolute activity of eNOS was greater in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+ than 100 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 1 A). The overall stimulation of eNOS was substantially greater over a range of HSP90 concentrations in the presence of 100 nm Ca2+(∼7-fold) than in the presence of 10 μmCa2+ (∼2-fold). At 100 nm Ca2+, eNOS activity was 353% above control at 12 nm HSP90 and 697% above control at 45 nm HSP90. At maximal calcium levels (10 μm Ca2+), the increase in eNOS activity to increasing HSP90 was smaller (139% at 12 nmHSP90 and 254% at 45 nm HSP90) but was significant. This increase occurred with eNOS bound to maximal and constant amounts of Ca2+/CaM at both of these HSP90 concentrations (see Fig. 5and results below).Figure 5Binding of HSP90 and CaM to eNOS. eNOS (9.8 nm) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with the indicated dose of HSP90 in the presence of 300 nm CaM and either 10 mm EGTA, 100 nm Ca2+, or 10 μm Ca2+. GA treatment was performed at 1 μm. Thereafter, eNOS was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-eNOS antibody, and the presence of eNOS, HSP90, and CaM was evaluated by immunoblotting. Ratios of intensity of HSP90 and CaM to eNOS in each group were determined, and then each relative intensity was calculated. Data are expressed as % of 45 nm HSP90 and 10 μm Ca2+ group and presented as mean ± S.E. for four determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ca2+ and CaM dependencies of eNOS activity were separately examined in the absence and presence of HSP90 (Fig. 3). eNOS activity in the presence of 300 nm CaM increased in a Ca2+-dependent manner in the absence and presence of HSP90 within the range of 30–1000 nmCa2+ and was maximally stimulated at calcium concentrations ≥1 μm (Fig. 3 A). HSP90 enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of eNOS under these conditions. The EC50 values of eNOS for Ca2+-dependent stimulation were 239 nm and 83 nm in the absence and presence of HSP90, respectively. HSP90 significantly increased eNOS activity at all calcium concentrations (maximal increase from 14.9 to 32.4 nmol/min/nmol of protein at 10 μm Ca2+). Fig.3 A shows that the maximal eNOS activity in the presence of HSP90 and 100 nm Ca2+ was 17.4 nmol/min/nmol of protein. In the absence of HSP90, the maximal eNOS activity attained was 14.9 nmol/min/nmol of protein. Therefore, at least 14% of the maximal measurable eNOS activity in these studies is due to an effect of HSP90 on the enzyme that is independent of Ca2+/CaM (see “Discussion”). HSP90 also augmented CaM-dependent eNOS activity (Fig.3 B). HSP90 reduced the EC50 value for CaM from 8.5 to 2.7 nm in the presence of 10 μmCa2+. The CaM effect became apparent at CaM levels ≥1 nm, though HSP90 had no measurable effect on eNOS activity at lower CaM concentrations, even at maximal Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3 B and data not shown). The rate of NO synthesis by eNOS is determined by the intrinsic activity of the reductase domain of the enzyme to transfer electrons to heme (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar, 23Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Google Scholar, 24Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Google Scholar). We examined whether the increase in eNOS activity in the presence of HSP90 is accompanied by enhanced reductase activity of eNOS by measuring NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reduction in the presence of 300 nm CaM. In the presence of EGTA, cytochrome c reductase activity of eNOS was minimal, and HSP90 had no effect on this activity (Fig.4 A). In the presence of 100 nm or 10 μm Ca2+, reductase activity was elevated in a Ca2+-dependent manner (0.22 ± 0.03 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 μ mol/min/mol of eNOS protein). The Ca2+/CaM-activated reductase activity was significantly enhanced by HSP90 at both 100 nm and 10 μm Ca2+ (5.9- and 1.8-fold, respectively). Next, we repeated these studies in the presence of SOD to explore differences that might have occurred due to reduction of cytochrome c by eNOS-derived superoxide (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). SOD decreased the rate of cytochrome creduction somewhat for control eNOS both at 100 nm and 10 μm Ca2+ (28.1% and 25.7%, respectively), but the majority of Ca2+/CaM-dependent reductase activity was still present. The extent of uncoupling was quite similar to previously reported values determined by the same method (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar). The cytochrome c reductase activity of eNOS in the presence of HSP90 was only slightly reduced by SOD, (6.7% at 100 nm Ca2+ and 10.3% at 10 μmCa2+) compared with the corresponding value without SOD. HSP90 still significantly promoted cytochrome c reductase activity of eNOS in the presence of SOD to degrees similar to those measured in the absence of SOD (7.3- and 2.0-fold at 100 nmand 10 μm Ca2+, respectively). The extents of the increases in eNOS activity (Fig. 1 A) and reductase activities (Fig. 4) in the presence of HSP90 were thus of similar magnitudes. These data support that HSP90 primarily stimulates the reductase activity of eNOS and, to a much lesser extent, inhibits uncoupling of the enzyme. Binding of HSP90 and CaM to eNOS was examined by immunoprecipitation studies with anti-eNOS antibody (Fig.5). HSP90 bound to eNOS in the absence of Ca2+ to a small degree, but eNOS-HSP90 complex formation was enhanced in a Ca2+-dependent manner. eNOS bound more HSP90 as the concentration of HSP90 present was increased. CaM was detected in the eNOS immunopellet only in the presence of Ca2+. At 100 nm Ca2+, HSP90 dose dependently increased the amount of CaM bound to eNOS along with the corresponding increase in HSP90 bound to the synthase. The absolute amount of CaM bound in the presence of 100 nmCa2+ and 45 nm HSP90 was substantially lower than the amount of CaM bound to eNOS at 10 μmCa2+ even in the absence of HSP90. The level of eNOS activity at 100 nm Ca2+ due to the presence of HSP90 was higher than the control eNOS activity at 10 μmCa2+ (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, HSP90 had no further effect on CaM binding at 10 μm Ca2+, although HSP90 still significantly (though modestly) increased eNOS activity (cf. Figs. 1 A and 2). GA potently inhibited HSP90 binding to eNOS in the absence and presence of calcium and abolished the effect of HSP90 on CaM binding at 100 nm. However, CaM binding to eNOS at 10 μm Ca2+was not affected by GA. The amount of CaM bound to eNOS at 10 μm Ca2+ was not influenced by HSP90 or GA, indicating that Ca2+/CaM binding to eNOS is saturated at 10 μm Ca2+. At 10 μm Ca2+, HSP90 increased both the NO synthase and cytochrome c reductase activities of eNOS. A dose-dependent increase in HSP90 binding to eNOS also was observed at high Ca2+ concentration. However, CaM binding was unchanged by HSP90 at this calcium concentration. To further explore the HSP90 effects at 10 μm Ca2+, we compared eNOS activities and measured the V maxand K m values of eNOS for l-arginine at 10 μm Ca2+ in the absence and presence of HSP90 (Fig. 6). eNOS exhibited a higher velocity of NO synthesis in the presence of HSP90. TheV max value for arginine was increased 2-fold by HSP90 (from 14.6 ± 0.15 to 28.7 ± 4.2 nmol/min/nmol of protein for eNOS in the absence or presence of HSP90, respectively). However, HSP90 did not affect the affinity for l-arginine as the K m value for l-arginine was 4.2 ± 0.3 in the presence and 4.1 ± 0.2 μm in the absence of HSP90. We prepared eNOS in the presence of EGTA (CaM-free eNOS) or 1 mm Ca2+ (CaM-bound eNOS) (Fig.7 A) and examined the effects of HSP90 on both the synthase and reductase activities of the enzyme (Fig. 7, B and C). HSP90 bound preferentially to CaM-bound eNOS and GA treatment prevented binding of HSP90 to eNOS. In addition, both NOS and cytochrome c reductase activities of CaM-bound eNOS were significantly enhanced by HSP90. These results show that HSP90 has a direct effect on eNOS pre-bound to CaM even in the absence of added (exogenous) CaM. We have examined the mechanism of HSP90 activation of eNOSin vitro. HSP90 appears to increase eNOS activity in the presence of Ca2+ and CaM by two mechanisms. Under conditions where eNOS is not saturated with CaM, HSP90 reduced the EC50 values for Ca2+ and CaM and dose dependently increased the amount of CaM bound to eNOS. These results indicate that HSP90 elevates the binding affinity of eNOS for CaM, resulting in an increase in NO synthesis. Gratton et al. (7Gratton J.-P. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Google Scholar) reported previously that CaM-induced dissociation of eNOS from caveolin is facilitated by HSP90 through an unknown mechanism. Our results support that an HSP90-induced increase in CaM binding might facilitate eNOS dissociation from this protein. The CaM-dependent mechanism we observed appears similar to the effect of HSP90 on nNOS, though the effect of HSP90 on eNOS activity appears to be greater than its effect on nNOS (25Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 357-360Google Scholar). Our data support that HSP90 also activates eNOS by a CaM-independent mechanism, which was detectable at high calcium levels. The evidence for a CaM-independent HSP90 effect includes the following. (i) HSP90 dose dependently increased NO synthesis and reductase activities of eNOS in the presence of saturating levels of Ca2+ and CaM (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). (ii) HSP90 binding to eNOS increases when the quantity of CaM bound to eNOS remains constant (Fig. 5), and this results in a further increase in eNOS activity (from 139% to 254% of basal eNOS activity at 12 and 45 nm HSP90, respectively; Fig. 2). (iii) Despite the fact that CaM is a critical determinant ofK m, HSP90 significantly increased theV max for l-arginine without affecting the K m in the presence of saturating Ca2+ and CaM (Fig. 6). (iv) HSP90 association with CaM-bound eNOS results in increases in NO synthesis and reductase activities of eNOS even in the absence of added CaM or any change in CaM binding to eNOS (Fig. 7). (v) These effects of HSP90 were prevented by an HSP90-specific inhibitor, geldanamycin (Figs. 1, 5, and 7). The CaM-independent effect of HSP90 causes only an ∼2-fold increase in eNOS activity at 45 nm HSP90 and is therefore weaker than the CaM-dependent effect of HSP90 on eNOS activity under these conditions. However, the combined CaM-dependent and -independent effects of HSP90 may both be active to varying degrees across a range of Ca2+ concentrations and cooperate in an additive or synergistic fashion to stimulate eNOS activity. Pritchardet al. (27Pritchard Jr., K.A. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Google Scholar) reported that HSP90 may prevent eNOS uncoupling and thus both inhibit superoxide production and increase NO synthesis. We observed modest eNOS uncoupling in the absence of HSP90, consistent with this prior work (27Pritchard Jr., K.A. Ackerman A.W. Gross E.R. Stepp D.W. Shi Y. Fontana J.T. Baker J.E. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17621-17624Google Scholar). However, uncoupling accounted for at most 20–25% of the decrease in the eNOS cytochrome c reductase, supporting that the stimulatory effects of HSP90 on eNOS activity account for the majority of the HSP90 effect. The data here support that HSP90 and CaM bind cooperatively to eNOS. eNOS has a higher affinity for CaM in the presence of HSP90, and, conversely, CaM-activated eNOS has a higher affinity for HSP90. Increases in both binding affinities might be expected to stabilize a complex between eNOS with CaM and HSP90. The precise molecular mechanisms by which HSP90 activates eNOS remain to be determined, but a refined model can be proposed based in part on the biological roles of HSP90 in other systems. HSP90 acts as a molecular chaperone and is involved in protein folding and regulation of protein conformation in signaling pathways such as those involving steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases (26Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1998; 217: 420-434Google Scholar). It is plausible that HSP90 induces a conformational change in eNOS that results in increases in the affinity of eNOS for CaM (CaM-dependent mechanism) and in increased reductase activity (CaM-independent mechanism). The CaM-independent effect of HSP90 to enhance reductase activity is consistent with the established concept that the rate of NO synthesis by eNOS is determined by this intrinsic reductase activity (22McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Google Scholar, 23Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5566-5571Google Scholar, 24Nishida C.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that HSP90 leads to relatively large increases in eNOS nitric oxide production at physiological Ca2+ concentrations. In concert with Akt phosphorylation, this may account for a marked reduction in the need for Ca2+ to achieve a given level of eNOS activation (6Brouet A. Sonveaux P. Dessy C. Balligand J.-L. Feron O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Google Scholar). This may be one explanation for observed increases in NO production by stimuli such as fluid shear stress and estrogen in the absence of detectable increases in cytosolic Ca2+ (5Russell K.S. Haynes M.P. Caulin-Glaser T. Rosneck J. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5026-5030Google Scholar, 14Caulin-Glaser T. Garcia-Cardena G. Sarrel P. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ.

Miyoshi E. Fujiwara N. Taniguchi N. Murata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3459-3467Google Scholar). In conclusion, HSP90 promotes eNOS activity by CaM-dependent and CaM-independent mechanisms, increases the affinity of eNOS for CaM, and stimulates an increase in the intrinsic reductase activity of eNOS in the presence of a fixed amount of CaM. Since HSP90 and CaM bind to eNOS at lower Ca2+ levels, both mechanisms of HSP90-dependent eNOS activation are predicted to contribute to the increase in efficiency of NO production by eNOS at physiological Ca2+ concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2048933338,"The Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III γ complex clamp loader assembles the ring-shaped β sliding clamp onto DNA. The core polymerase is tethered to the template by β, enabling processive replication of the genome. Here we investigate the DNA substrate specificity of the clamp-loading reaction by measuring the pre-steady-state kinetics of DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis using elongation-proficient and deficient primer/template DNA. The ATP-bound clamp loader binds both elongation-proficient and deficient DNA substrates either in the presence or absence of β. However, elongation-proficient DNA preferentially triggers γ complex to release β onto DNA with concomitant hydrolysis of ATP. Binding to elongation-proficient DNA converts the γ complex from a high affinity ATP-bound state to an ADP-bound state having a 105-fold lower affinity for DNA. Steady-state binding assays are misleading, suggesting that γ complex binds much more avidly to non-extendable primer/template DNA because recycling to the high affinity binding state is rate-limiting. Pre-steady-state rotational anisotropy data reveal a dynamic association-dissociation of γ complex with extendable primer/templates leading to the diametrically opposite conclusion. The strongly favored dynamic recognition of extendable DNA does not require the presence of β. Thus, the γ complex uses ATP binding and hydrolysis as a mechanism for modulating its interaction with DNA in which the ATP-bound form binds with high affinity to DNA but elongation-proficient DNA substrates preferentially trigger hydrolysis of ATP and conversion to a low affinity state."

Here we demonstrate that expression of a caspase-8 non-cleavable (nc) BID-D59A mutant or expression of wild type (wt) BID induces apoptosis in Bid −/−, caspase-8 −/−, and wt primary MEFs. Western blot analysis indicated that no cleavage products appeared in cells expressing ncBID. ncBID was as effective as wtBID in inducing cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. ncBID and wtBID (nc/wtBID) were much less effective than tBID in localizing to mitochondria and in inducing cytochrome c release, but only slightly less effective in inducing apoptosis. Studies with Apaf-1- and caspase-9-deficient primary MEFs indicated that both proteins were essential for nc/wtBID and for tBID-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, expression of non-apoptotic levels of either ncBID or wtBID in Bid −/− MEFs induced a similar and significant enhancement in apoptosis in response to a variety of death signals, which was accompanied by enhanced localization of BID to mitochondria and cytochrome crelease.

The BCL-2 family members are major regulators of the apoptotic process (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3336) Google Scholar). The cell death regulatory mechanism of these proteins is unknown, although it is thought that their function depends mostly on their ability to modulate mitochondrial function. This family is comprised of both pro-, as well as anti-apoptotic proteins. A subset of the proapoptotics are the BH3-only proteins. Another major component of the death machinery is a proteolytic system involving a family of cysteine proteases named caspases (2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Two major apoptotic pathways have been identified: the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The cell-intrinsic apoptotic pathway is initiated when the outer mitochondrial membrane becomes permeable, resulting in the release of cytochrome c (Cytc)1 and other intermembrane space proteins (3Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, Cyt cinduces the oligomerization of Apaf-1, which forms a multimeric complex that recruits and leads to the activation of caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 leads to downstream caspase-3 activation resulting in apoptotic cell death. Strong support for the necessity and linearity of this pathway has come from animal knockout studies. These studies have demonstrated that Apaf-1-, caspase-9-, and caspase-3-deficient embryonic stem cells (ES) or fibroblasts (MEFs) are resistant to intrinsic damage signals (4Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cyt c-deficient ES cells showed a similar resistant to various apoptotic stimuli (5Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In the extrinsic pathway, apoptosis is initiated through activation of certain cell surface receptors. The best characterized are members of the TNF/Fas receptor family. Once engaged by ligand, these receptors initiate the formation of the DISC, which leads to activation of caspase-8 (6Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Active caspase-8 can initiate both the activation of a cascade of caspases and the cleavage of the proapoptotic BID protein. Cleavage of cytosolic BID at Asp-59 yields a p15 C-terminal truncated fragment (tBID) that translocates to the mitochondria to induce the release of Cyt c (7Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MEFs deficient in either Bak or Bax are sensitive to tBID-induced cell death; however, Bax, Bak double deficient MEFs are completely resistant to tBID-induced cell death as well as to multiple apoptotic stimuli (13Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). The requirement for BID in the extrinsic death pathway was demonstrated in Bid-deficient mice, which are resistant to Fas-induced hepatocellular apoptosis (14Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The fact that BID is cleaved by caspase-8 and tBID translocates to the mitochondria to initiate an apoptotic program suggests that the proapoptotic activity of BID depends upon its cleavage. In addition,in vitro studies as well as studies using permeabilized cells have demonstrated that full-length BID is much less effective than tBID in targeting to mitochondria and in inducing the release of Cyt c (8Luo X.

Based on the studies mentioned above, full-length BID seems to be the inactive form of this protein. However, several studies have suggested differently. One of these studies has demonstrated that addition of staurosporine (STS) to HeLa cells induced the translocation of BID to the mitochondria (17Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Another study using purified mitochondria has demonstrated that BID was capable of inducing the oligomerization and insertion of BAX into the outer mitochondrial membrane (11Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Translocation of BID to mitochondria, resulting in Cyt crelease and apoptotic cell death was recently demonstrated in Jurkat T cells treated with either ceramide or anti-Fas antibodies in combination with inhibitors to both caspase-8 and PARP (18Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10073-10082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The possible involvement of phospholipids in the translocation of BID was demonstrated in a study showing that physiological concentrations of certain phospholipids induced the translocation of BID to the mitochondria (19Esposti M.D. Erler J.T. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7268-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that uncleaved BID may play an active role in mitochondria during apoptosis. To further define the ability of full-length BID to induce apoptosis and to explore its mechanism of action, we mutated the caspase-8 cleavage site in BID and analyzed the effects of this mutant in Bid −/− and wild type primary MEFs. We demonstrate that the caspase-8 non-cleavable (nc) BID mutant is a potent inducer of apoptosis in both types of MEFs. Both ncBID and wild type (wt) BID were much less effective than tBID in inducing Cyt c release, but only slightly less effective in inducing apoptosis. Apaf-1, caspase-9, and both BAX and BAK, but not caspase-3 or caspase-8 were essential for both nc/wtBID and tBID-induced apoptosis in primary MEFs. Finally, expression of non-apoptotic levels of either ncBID or wtBID in Bid −/− MEFs induced a similar and significant enhancement in apoptosis in response to a variety of death signals. Thus, these results implicate full-length BID as an active player in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. For the expression of BID in MEFs we have produced adenovirus vectors expressing BID under the control of tetracycline (tet)-regulatable promoters. In these constructs the E1 region of the virus was replaced with either a D59A mutant of BID (ncBID), wild-type (wt) BID, or tBID. Two types of adenovectors were produced: 1) a “tet-on” inducible vector that relies on the reverse tet transactivator (rtTA) (20Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar) for the expression of either wtBID or ncBID tagged with a C-terminal FLAG epitope; 2) a tet operator containing a full CMV promoter-driven vector system, which is inhibitable with the tet repressor (tetR) (T-REx, Invitrogen), for the constitutive expression of either wtBID or tBID tagged with a C-terminal HA epitope or for the expression of GFP. We have used this system for the expression of tBID since tBID under control of the tetracycline-inducible promoter was too toxic to the 293 packaging cells and therefore viruses could not be prepared. To produce the adenovectors, the genes to be expressed were cloned into pCA14 (a CMV promoter-containing variant of pΔE1sp1A) or variants in which we had replaced the CMV promoter to tet-regulatable promoters. The pCA14 construct is a shuttle vector for making adenovectors with inserts in the E1 region of the viral genome. For the tet-on vectors, the promoter from pTRE (Clontech) containing 2 tet operator sites and a minimal CMV was used to replace the full CMV promoter in pCA14 to produce pCA14Tind. For the T-REx-driven vectors, the promoter from pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) containing a full CMV promoter with two upstream tet operator sites was subcloned in place of the CMV promoter in pCA14 to produce pCA14T-Rex. This T-REx system functions as a constitutive promoter in all cell types lacking the tet repressor. The ncBid gene was cloned into pCA14Tind; wtBidwas cloned into pCA14Tind and pCA14T-REx; tBid andGFP were cloned into pCA14T-Rex, and thertTA gene was from pUHD17-1 (20Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2039) Google Scholar) was cloned into pCA14. To produce adenovirus vectors, individual pCA14 and pCA14Tind-derived shuttle vectors were introduced into 293T cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) together with pJM17 (an adenovirus genomic construct lacking the E1 region of the virus) to produce recombinant viruses by the standard procedure. At each stage of viral plaque purification, PCR screening was used to confirm that the correct inserts were present. The only difference with pCA14T-REx-based adenovirus vectors was that the lipofections were done in 293T-TR cells, which are a variant of 293T cells that express the tetR from a stable plasmid integration with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen). The tetR keeps the inserted gene repressed during virus production. Viruses were grown using 293T or 293T-TR cells depending on the promoter they contained. Virus preparations were made from freeze-thaw lysis of the cells, and virus titers were done on 293T-TR cells. In experiments, cells were generally seeded at 70–80% confluence. With the tet-inducible system, cells were infected with an MOI (multiplicity of infection) of 100 with both the BID containing virus and the rtTA-containing virus. 1 μg/ml doxycycline (a synthetic analog of tetracycline; Sigma) was added to the medium 12–15 h postinfection to activate gene expression from the tet-inducible promoter. With the T-REx BID viruses, cells were infected at an MOI of 100. Efficiency of infection was determined using the recombinant adenovirus carrying the constitutive expressing vector of GFP (pCA14T-Rex-GFP) and was in the range of 70–90%. Wild type and knockout primary MEFs were prepared from 11–13 days embryos, and maintained in ISCOVE's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Caspase-9 −/− and caspase-3 −/− primary MEFs were obtained from Richard A. Flavell and Apaf-1 −/− primary MEFs were obtained from Tak W. Mak. Caspase-8 −/− primary MEFs were a generous gift from David Wallach (Weizmann Institute). Bax,Bak double-deficient primary MEFs were a generous gift from Stanley J. Korsmeyer (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). SV-40 transformation of primary MEFs was performed by transfecting cells with the SV-40 whole genome using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable clones were collected 14–18 days post-transfection. TNFα, ActD, and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma. Etoposide, cisplatin, and thapsigargin were purchased from Alexis. Cell viability was determined at the designated time points by propidium iodide (PI)/dye exclusion. PI (2.5 μg/ml) was added to the cells immediately prior to FACScan (BD Biosciences) analysis. Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μm digitonin, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were used for the assays. Enzymatic reactions were carried out in buffer A containing 20 μg of protein and 50 μmacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) to measure caspase-3 activity, and acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (LEHD-AMC) to measure caspase-9 activity. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and fluorescent AMC formation was measured at excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm using a microplate spectrofluorometer (SPECTRAmax, Molecular Devices). Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, BioRad). Antibodies included anti-mBID (21Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), and anti-active caspase-3 (CM-1; a generous gift from Idun Pharmaceuticals). Western blots were developed by use of the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For immunocytochemistry, primary MEFs were grown on glass coverslips. At the designated time points, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. For blocking, the cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton and 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. For double-immunostaining, cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-cytochrome c 6H2.B4 monoclonal antibodies (BD PharMingen, diluted 1:200) together with either anti-BID antibodies (diluted 1:200) or CM-1 antibodies (diluted 1:50) in blocking solution. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton, the cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature with Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse (dilution 1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit Abs (dilution 1:150, Molecular Probes), followed by 5 min of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining (10 μg/ml). For staining of mitochondria, cells were incubated with 100 nm Mitotracker red (MTR; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. The coverslips were mounted with elvanol, and the cells were viewed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope at a magnification of ×200/×400. Pictures were taken with a 1310 digital camera (DVC). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV microscope (Oberkochen, Germany), attached to the Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning system, operated by LaserSharp software. In order to define whether cleavage of BID by caspase-8 is essential for triggering its apoptotic activity, we have constructed recombinant adenoviruses carrying tetracycline-inducible vectors of either wtBID or a caspase-8 ncBID-D59A mutant tagged with a C-terminal FLAG epitope. Bid −/− primary MEFs were infected with each of the viruses and 12–15 h later doxycycline was added to the culture to induce BID expression. Expression of BID was analyzed by Western blot using anti-BID antibodies. Low levels of expression of both wtBID and ncBID were detected in the absence of doxycycline because of leakage of the tet promoter (Fig.1 A, top). A significant increase in the expression of both forms was detected by 4.5 h post- doxycycline treatment. Importantly, wtBID was cleaved to generate p15 tBID, whereas ncBID was not (Fig. 1 A,top). Next, we measured the levels of cell death 8- and 24-h postinduction of BID expression. Strikingly, expression of either wtBID or ncBID induced comparable levels of cell death (Fig. 1 A,bottom). To assure that cell death was indeed due to expression of nc/wtBID, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus carrying a constitutive expressing vector of GFP, and found that infection of Bid −/− MEFs with this adenovirus had little effect on cell viability (Fig. 1 A, bottom). To assess whether full-length BID can induce apoptosis in the absence of caspase-8, caspase-8 −/− primary MEFs were infected with either of the recombinant viruses, and the levels of death were measured following doxycycline treatment. Expression of either wtBID or ncBID induced a similar and significant increase in the levels of cell death (Fig. 1 B, top). Thus, cleavage of BID by caspase-8 is not essential for triggering its apoptotic activity in primary MEFs. Interestingly, Western blot analysis indicated that in caspase-8 −/− MEFs, exogenous FLAG-tagged wtBID and endogenous BID were cleaved to generate p15 tBID but FLAG-tagged ncBID was not (Fig.1 B, bottom). Since the cleavage of wtBID probably occurs only after the death process has been initiated, these results suggest that ncBID and wtBID (nc/wtBID) are capable of inducing the activation of a downstream caspase (other than caspase-8) that feeds back to cleave wtBID at Asp59. In this respect, caspase-3 was shown to cleave BID at Asp-59 downstream of mitochondria (22Woo M. Hakem A. Elia A.J. Hakem R. Duncan G.S. Patterson B.J. Mak T.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 23Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The translocation of tBID to the mitochondria leads to Cyt c release, apoptosome formation and caspase-9 and -3 activation. To determine whether these caspases were activated in Bid −/− MEFs expressing nc/wtBID, the cleavage of specific fluorogenic peptide substrates, LEHD-AMC for the caspase-9-like subset and DEVD-AMC for the caspase-3-like subset, were measured. In wtBID-expressing cells, caspase-9 and -3 activities appeared 4.5-h postinduction of BID expression, peaked at 7 h, and decreased by 10 h (Fig.2 A). In ncBID-expressing cells, there was lower activation of caspase-9, but the overall time course of caspase-9 and -3 activation was similar to the time course observed in the wtBID-expressing cells (Fig. 2 A). A similar set of experiments using caspase-9- and caspase-3-deficient primary MEFs clearly indicated that the activities measured with the LEHD-AMC and DEVD-AMC peptide substrates were specific for caspase-9 and caspase-3, respectively (Fig. 2 A). To further confirm that these caspases were activated and that there was no significant difference in the time course of caspase activation between the two BID forms, the cleavage of caspase-3 was analyzed by Western blot. Using the CM-1 antibody, which principally recognizes the p17 cleaved form of caspase-3 (24Srinivasan A. Roth K.A. Sayers R.O. Shindler K.S. Wong A.M. Fritz L.C. Tomaselli K.J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1004-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we detected a weak signal by 3-h postinduction of either wtBID or ncBID, and a much stronger signal by 5- and 8-h postinduction (Fig. 2 B). At 5-h postinduction, the level of cleaved caspase-3 in ncBID-expressing cells was lower than the level in wtBID-expressing cells but eventually reached similar levels by 8-h postinduction. The results presented above suggest that ncBID acts by inducing the release of Cyt c from mitochondria, leading to apoptosome formation and caspase activation. Next, we analyzed the ability of ncBID to induce Cyt c release. Since tBID is 100-fold more effective than full-length BID in inducing Cytc release from mitochondria in vitro (16Madesh M. Antonsson B. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5651-5659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we used tBID as a positive control in these experiments. For this purpose we constructed two additional recombinant adenoviruses carrying constitutive expressing vectors of either wtBID or tBID tagged with a C-terminal HA epitope. The time course of wt/tBID expression using the constitutive system was similar to the time course of nc/wtBID expression using the inducible system. Of note, the levels of tBID generated in cells infected with the constitutive wtBID virus were similar to the levels of tBID expressed in cells infected with the tBID virus (Fig. 3 A). In this set of experiments, the cellular location of BID and the release of Cytc were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Bid −/− primary MEFs were infected with either the inducible or the constitutive adenoviruses, fixed and stained with both anti-BID and anti-Cytc antibodies. The nuclei were stained by DAPI. Both ncBID and wtBID (inducible or constitutive expression) were mainly localized to the cytosol, and in a low percent of the cells Cyt c was substantially released (Fig. 3 B and see below). A closer examination of both ncBID and wtBID-expressing cells indicated that Cytc was substantially released only in cells in which BID showed a punctate staining (Fig. 3 B). Prestaining of the cells with Mitotracker indicated that the BID punctate staining represented mitochondrial localization (Fig. 3 C). 5- and 8-h postinduction, BID was localized to mitochondria in only ∼20% of the cells expressing nc/wtBID, and only in these cells Cyt c was substantially released (Fig. 3 D, left panel). Using the constitutive system, tBID was localized to mitochondria in 100% of the cells infected with the tBID virus, and in 73 ± 6.6% of these cells Cyt c was substantially released (Fig.3, B and D, right panel). In contrast, in cells infected with the wtBID virus, BID was localized to mitochondria in only 14 ± 1.6% of the cells, and only in these cells Cyt c was substantially released (Fig. 3 D,right panel). The fact that only 14% of the cells infected with the wtBID virus substantially released Cyt c compared with 73% of the cells infected with the tBID virus is surprising in light of the fact that the levels of tBID detected in both infected cells were similar (Fig. 3 A). To compare the level of apoptosis in cells infected with either the wtBID or tBID viruses, apoptotic nuclei were counted in the cells from the same experiment that was performed to monitor Cyt c release. As shown in Fig. 4 E, wtBID induced less apoptosis than tBID at 5-h postinfection, but similar levels at 8-h postinfection. Thus, wtBID is capable of inducing comparable levels of apoptosis compared with tBID but with less release of Cytc.Figure 4nc/wtBID induce the cleavage of effector caspases also in cells, which show a punctate/mitochondrial staining of Cyt c. Bid −/− primary MEFs were infected with the ncBID virus, treated for 6 h with doxycycline, fixed and double immunostained with the CM-1 Ab (green) and the Cytc Ab (red). The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining (blue). Top, A, most of the CM-1-positive cells (71 ± 4.2%) showed nuclear condensation resulting in artificial fluorescence staining. B, 22 ± 6.5% of the CM-1-positive cells with intact nuclei released Cytc. C, 7 ± 2% of the CM-1-positive cells with intact nuclei did not release Cyt c. Bottom, a graph summarizing the percentages indicated above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A possible explanation for the results presented in the previous section is that nc/wtBID are actually inducing the release of Cyt c in a larger percent of the infected cell population, but since the release is not robust in these cells (as in the case of tBID) it may be difficult to detect by immunofluorescence. Previous calculations have demonstrated that ∼20% of the total mitochondrial Cyt cis sufficient to induce caspase activation (25Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30299-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To address this issue we have preformed immunofluorescence studies using the CM-1 antibody, and searched for CM-1-positive cells, which retained Cyt cin the mitochondria. 71 ± 4.2% of the CM-1-positive cells showed nuclear condensation and therefore were not suitable for our analysis (Fig. 4 A). Among the CM-1-positive cells that had an intact nuclei, 22 ± 6.5% released Cyt c and 7 ± 2% did not (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). These results suggest that nc/wtBID are probably inducing low levels of Cytc release in more than ∼20% of the infected cells, which is sufficient to induce effector caspase cleavage/activation. On the other hand, these results might suggest that nc/wtBID could induce caspase activation independently of Cyt c release. However, this is probably not the case since expression of nc/wtBID in Bax, Bak double-deficient MEFs (which are resistant to tBID-induced Cytc release, Ref. 13Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar) did not result in the appearance of CM-1-positive cells (not shown). The results presented above suggest that Cyt c release, apoptosome formation and activation of caspase-9 and -3 are important for nc/wtBID-induced cell death. Next, we determined whether Apaf-1, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were essential for these forms of BID to induce cell death. Wild type primary MEFs and primary MEFs deficient in Apaf-1, caspase-9, or caspase-3 were infected with nc/wtBID viruses and cell death was measured 24 h post-BID induction. Both Apaf-1 −/− and caspase-9 −/− cells were completely resistant to the expression of both forms of BID (Fig. 5 A). These cells remained viable even 96 h post-BID expression. In contrast, caspase-3 −/− cells were susceptible to both forms of BID but died with delayed kinetics compared with wild-type cells (Fi"

We have previously shown that unusually low sulfated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the intervillous spaces of the placenta are the receptors for IRBC adhesion, which involves a chondroitin 4-sulfate motif consisting of six disaccharide moieties with ∼30% 4-sulfated residues. However, it was puzzling how the placental CSPGs, which have only ∼8% of the disaccharide 4-sulfated, could efficiently bind IRBCs. Thus, we undertook to determine the precise structural features of the CS chains of placental CSPGs that interact with IRBCs. We show that the placental CSPGs are a mixture of two major populations, which are similar by all criteria except differing in their sulfate contents; 2–3% and 9–14% of the disaccharide units of the CS chains are 4-sulfated, and the remainder are nonsulfated. The majority of the sulfate groups in the CSPGs are clustered in CS chain domains consisting of 6–14 repeating disaccharide units. While the sulfate-rich regions of the CS chains contain 20–28% 4-sulfated disaccharides, the other regions have little or no sulfate. Further, we find that the placental CSPGs are able to efficiently bind IRBCs due to the presence of 4-sulfated disaccharide clusters. The oligosaccharides corresponding to the sulfate-rich domains of the CS chains efficiently inhibited IRBC adhesion. Thus, our data demonstrate, for the first time, the unique distribution of sulfate groups in the CS chains of placental CSPGs and that these sulfate-clustered domains have the necessary structural elements for the efficient adhesion of IRBCs, although the CS chains have an overall low degree of sulfation.

Thus, the parasite, by its ability to express divergent P. falciparum EMP1s using the var gene repertoire, can adhere to various organs. However, over a period of time, the host develops antibodies against the exposed P. falciparum EMP1 that are able to inhibit adhesion of IRBC adhesion and aid clearance of infection (29Fried M.

Immun. 2001; 69: 7487-7492Google Scholar). To overcome this defensive mechanism, the parasite constantly switches, at low frequency, to various adherent phenotypes by expressing P. falciparum EMP1s with different receptor specificity (35Taylor H.M. Kyes S.A. Newbold C.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 391-397Google Scholar, 36Nielsen M.A. Staalsoe T. Kurtzhals J.A. Goka B.Q. Dodoo D. Alifrangis M. Theander T.G. Akanmori B.D. Hviid L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3444-3450Google Scholar). This ability of the parasite to express P. falciparum EMP1, for which the host has not yet developed adhesion-inhibitory antibodies, enables it to selectively adhere through a different receptor. In this manner, when one adherent phenotype of parasite is eliminated by the host, another phenotype continues to thrive. In endemic areas, people by adulthood acquire a broad spectrum protective immunity against P. falciparum, including antibodies to P. falciparumEMP1s (37Baird J.K. Parasitol.

Therefore, in immune-protected people, the IRBCs cannot adhere in the vascular capillaries, limiting the parasite growth. In pregnant women, however, the placenta provides a new opportunity for IRBC adhesion, because women lack immunity against placenta-adherent parasites prior to pregnancy (39Fried M. Duffy P.E.

Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar). These CSPGs were found to be unusually low sulfated; on an average, only ∼8% of the disaccharide repeating units of the CS chains of placental CSPGs are 4-sulfated, and the remainder are nonsulfated (50Achur R.N.

Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Google Scholar). A recent study confirmed most of our findings (52Chai W. Beeson J.G. Lawson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22438-22446Google Scholar), except that four or five rather than two of the disaccharide repeating units of the binding motif containing six-disaccharide repeating units needs to be 4-sulfated for effective IRBC binding. However, it should be noted that these investigators measured C4S-IRBC interactions by immobilizing the commercially available bovine trachea C4S/C6S copolymer (52Chai W. Beeson J.G. Lawson A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22438-22446Google Scholar), a nonrelevant glycosaminoglycan, rather than the placental CSPGs, the natural receptor used in our study (50Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar). Regardless of this discrepancy, it remained a puzzle how IRBCs are able to efficiently bind the unusually low sulfated CS chains of the placental intervillous space CSPGs. A full understanding of the structural requirements for IRBC binding to placenta is important for developing therapeutics or vaccine for placental malaria (53Staalsoe T. Jensen A. Theander T. Hviid L. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 84: 133-136Google Scholar). Therefore, in this study, we investigated in detail the structure of the CS chains of placental CSPGs, particularly the pattern of sulfate group distribution and its correlation to IRBC binding. The placental CSPGs were fractionated into two differentially sulfated proteoglycan populations and their CS chains isolated. The polysaccharide chains were degraded with an endoenzyme that specifically cleaves the nonsulfated regions of the CS into disaccharides, and the oligosaccharide products thus obtained were purified and examined for their ability to inhibit IRBC binding to intact CSPGs. The data demonstrate that, although the overall sulfate content of the CS chains of placental CSPGs are markedly lower than that required for optimal binding, the sulfate groups in the CS chains are clustered in uniquely size-defined domains. These sulfate-rich CS domains have the requisite structural features for the efficient binding of IRBCs. Proteus vulgarischondroitinase ABC (120 units/mg), Streptococcus dysgalactiae hyaluronidase (0.5 units/vial) andStreptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (2000 turbidity-reducing units/mg), Flavobacterium heparinum heparitinase (113 units/mg), chondroitin, and C4S (sturgeon notochord) were purchased from Seikagaku America (Falmouth, MA); ovine testicular hyaluronidase (2160 units/mg) was from ICN Biomedicals; C4S (bovine trachea) was from Sigma; Sepharose CL-6B, Sepharose CL-4B, DEAE-Sephacel, DEAE-Sepharose, and blue dextran were from Amersham Biosciences; Bio-Gel P-6 was from Bio-Rad; HPLC grade 6m HCl, trifluoroacetic acid, and micro-BCA protein assay kit were from Pierce; polystyrene Petri dishes (Falcon 1058) were from Becton Dickinson Labware. C4S with 36% 4-sulfate was prepared by the regioselective 6-O-desulfation of bovine trachea C4S/C6S copolymer as described previously (51Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Google Scholar) and fractionation of the product by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. 2R. N. Achur and D. C. Gowda, unpublished results. C4S 6-mers with 36% 4-sulfate was prepared by the digestion of C4S containing 36% 4-sulfate group with testicular hyaluronidase and fractionation of the oligosaccharides by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-6.2C4Ss with 3 and 11% 4-sulfate groups were prepared by the solvolytic desulfation of a fully 4-sulfated C4S from sturgeon notochord as described previously (51Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Google Scholar). The low sulfated CSPGs of the placental intervillous spaces were isolated as described previously with minor modification (50Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar). Briefly, the placentas were cut into small pieces and extracted with PBS, pH 7.2, containing protease inhibitors, and the extract was applied onto DEAE-Sephacel columns (2.5 × 22 cm). The columns were washed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, and then equilibrated with 50 mm NaOAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.5. The bound material was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.9 m NaCl in 50 mmNaOAc, pH 5.5. 10-ml fractions were collected, and aliquots were analyzed for uronic acid content (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). Uronic acid-containing fractions corresponding to BCSPG-2, the major CSPG of the placental intervillous spaces (50Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar), were pooled and dialyzed against water. The dialysates were adjusted to 50 mm NaOAc, 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.5, and applied onto DEAE-Sepharose columns (2.5 × 17 cm). The columns were washed with 50 mm NaOAc, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 5.5, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–0.55m NaCl in 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.5. Fractions of 10-ml were collected, absorption at 260 and 280 nm was measured, and aliquots were analyzed for uronic acid content (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). The crude CSPG fractions obtained by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography were dissolved (1 mg/ml) in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 4m guanidine hydrochloride, and 42% (w/w) CsBr. The solutions were centrifuged in a Beckman 50 TI rotor at 44,000 rpm for 65 h (55Yphantis D.A. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 297-317Google Scholar). Gradients were collected from the bottom of the centrifuge tubes into 15 equal fractions and analyzed for uronic acid content (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar) and for proteins by measuring the absorption at 260 and 280 nm. The CSPG fractions obtained from the CsBr density gradient centrifugation step were further purified by chromatography on columns of Sepharose CL-6B (1 × 49 cm) and/or Sepharose CL-4B (1 × 48 cm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, containing 4m guanidine hydrochloride. Fractions were collected and monitored for absorption at 260 and 280 nm and for uronic acid content (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). The purified CSPGs (0.3 mg) were treated with S. hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase and heparitinase as described previously (50Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar). The enzyme-incubation mixtures were chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-6 (1 × 47 cm) in 0.1m acetic acid, 0.1 m pyridine. Fractions (0.67 ml) were collected and analyzed for uronic acid (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). The purified CSPGs were treated with 0.1 m NaOH, 1 m NaBH4for 18–20 h under nitrogen atmosphere at 45 °C (56Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Google Scholar). The solutions were cooled in ice bath, neutralized with 1 m cold acetic acid, and then dried in a rotary evaporator. Boric acid was removed by repeated evaporation in a rotary evaporator by the addition of methanol, 0.1% acetic acid. The residue was applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1 × 10 cm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 7.8, and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15–0.6m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions (2.5 ml) were collected, and aliquots were assayed for uronic acid content (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). Uronic acid-positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. The placental CS chains and chondroitin (1.4–1.8 mg each) were treated with S. dysgalactiae hyaluronidase (300 milliunits) in 250 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 0.02% BSA at 37 °C for 24 h (57Hamai A. Morikawa K. Horie K. Tokuyasu K. Seikagaku. 1986; 58: 783Google Scholar). The enzyme digests were heated at 100 °C for 5 min, centrifuged, and then chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-6 columns (1 × 47 cm) in 0.1m pyridine, 0.1 m acetic acid. Fractions (0.67 ml) were collected, and aliquots were analyzed for uronic acid (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). The CS oligosaccharides were dissolved in 100 mm Tris base, 100 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3, containing 5% glycerol (58Wall R.S. Gyi T.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 298-299Google Scholar). The solutions were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (15 × 16 cm) in 100 mm Tris base, 100 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3. The gels were stained with 0.03% Alcian Blue in 25% ethanol, 10% aqueous acetic acid for 4 h and destained with 25% ethanol, 10% aqueous acetic acid. For silver staining, the gels were treated with 10% aqueous glutaraldehyde for 30 min and washed with water three times for 30 min each. The gels were then treated with freshly prepared ammoniacal silver for 15 min, washed with water two times for 30 s each, developed with 0.005% citric acid and 0.019% formaldehyde in water, and then washed with water (59Krueger Jr., R.C. Schwartz N.B. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 295-300Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides (fractions 20–35, 50 μg) obtained by the Bio-Gel P-6 chromatography of the S. dysgalactiae hyaluronidase digest of chondroitin were dissolved in 20 mm NaOAc, 50 mm NaCl, pH 5.0, and applied onto a DEAE-Sepharose microcolumn (0.1-ml bed volume). After washing with 0.5 ml of the above buffer, the bound oligosaccharides were eluted stepwise with buffer containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m NaCl (0.5 ml each). Fractions (0.1 ml) were collected, and aliquots were analyzed for uronic acid (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide-containing fractions were pooled and digested with chondroitinase ABC, and the disaccharides formed were analyzed by HPLC. The C4Ss or C4S oligosaccharides (10–15 μg) were digested with chondroitinase ABC (10–20 milliunits) in 50 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm NaOAc and 0.01% BSA at 37 °C for 12–15 h (60Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Google Scholar). The released, unsaturated disaccharides were analyzed on an amine-bond Microsorb-MV column (4.6 × 250 mm; Varian) using Waters 600E HPLC system (Milford, MA) (61Sugahara K. Shigeno K. Masuda M. Fujii N. Kurosaka A. Takeda K. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 145-163Google Scholar). The enzyme digests were injected, and the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 16–530 mm NaH2PO4 over 70 min at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution of disaccharides was monitored by measuring the absorption at 232 nm using a Waters 484 variable wavelength UV detector. The data were processed with the Millennium 2010 chromatography manager using NEC PowerMate 433 data processing system. The CSPGs or CS chains (5–10 μg) were hydrolyzed with 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 6 h. The hydrolysates were dried in a Speed-Vac and analyzed on a CarboPac PA1 high pH anion exchange HPLC column (4 × 250 mm; Dionex) (62Hardy M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 76-82Google Scholar). The column was eluted with 20 mm sodium hydroxide, elution of sugars was monitored by pulsed amperometric detection, and the response factors for sugars were determined using standard sugar solutions. The uronic acid contents in various column chromatography fractions were determined by the carbazole-sulfuric acid method (54Dische Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 167: 189-198Google Scholar). Protein contents were measured using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit from Pierce (63Redinbaugh M.G. Turley R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 267-271Google Scholar). The C4S adherent P. falciparum, selected by panning of 3D7 laboratory parasite clones on placental CSPG-coated plastic plates, were used in this study. The parasites were cultured using type O-positive human red blood cells at 3% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mmHEPES, 29 mm sodium bicarbonate, 0.005% hypoxanthine,p-aminobenzoic acid (2 mg/liter), gentamycin sulfate (50 mg/liter), and 10% O-positive human serum. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% nitrogen, 5% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide (51Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Google Scholar). The adherence of IRBCs was performed by coating solutions (10–15 μl) of purified CSPGs as circular spots on 150 × 15-mm plastic Petri dishes as described previously (51Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Google Scholar). The specificity of IRBC binding to CSPGs was ascertained by incubating the CSPG-coated plates with chondroitinase ABC (50 milliunits/ml) as well as by competitive inhibition with various C4Ss. For adhesion-inhibition assays, IRBCs were incubated with various C4Ss or C4S oligosaccharides at the indicated concentrations in PBS, pH 7.2, in 96-well microtiter plates at room temperature for 30 min with intermittent mixing (51Alkhalil A. Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40357-40364Google Scholar). The IRBC suspension was then layered on CSPG-coated spots on Petri dishes. After 40 min at room temperature, the unbound cells were washed, and the bound cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, stained with Giemsa, and counted using a light microscope. The major low sulfated CSPG fraction (previously designated as BCSPG-2) (50Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar) was isolated by one-step DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of the isotonic buffer extract of placentas. This CSPG fraction represents about 93–94% of the total low sulfated CSPGs in the intervillous spaces (50Achur R.N. Valiyaveettil M. Alkhalil A. Ockenhouse C.F. Gowda D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40344-40356Google Scholar). When subjected to DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, using a 0.15–0.55 m NaCl gradient, the CSPG was partially resolved into two fractions (designated BCSPG-2a and BCSPG-2b) that are distinct in their sulfation levels (Fig. 1). The proportions of BCSPG-2a and BCSPG-2b varied considerably from one placenta to another, in the range 40–65% and 35–60%, respectively. These CSPG fractions were further purified and characterized, and their ability to bind IRBCs was studied. On CsBr density"
https://openalex.org/W2048539816,"EphB6 is the most recently identified member of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family. EphB6 is primarily expressed in thymocytes and a subpopulation of T cells, suggesting that it may be involved in regulation of T lymphocyte differentiation and functions. We show here that overexpression of EphB6 in Jurkat T cells and stimulation with the EphB6 ligand, ephrin-B1, results in the selective inhibition of TCR-mediated activation of JNK but not the MAPK pathway. EphB6 appears to suppress the JNK pathway by preventing T cell receptor (TCR)-induced activation of the small GTPase Rac1, a critical event in initiating the JNK cascade. Furthermore, EphB6 blocked anti-CD3-induced secretion of IL-2 and CD25 expression in a ligand-dependent manner. Dominant negative EphB6 suppressed the inhibitory activity of the endogenous receptor and enhanced anti-CD3-induced JNK activation, CD25 expression, and IL-2 secretion, confirming the requirement for EphB6-specific signaling. Activation of the JNK pathway and the establishment of an IL-2/IL-2R autocrine loop have been shown to play a role in the negative selection of CD4+CD8+ self-reacting thymocytes. In agreement, stimulation of murine thymocytes with ephrin-B1 not only blocked anti-CD3-induced CD25 up-regulation and IL-2 production, but also inhibited TCR-mediated apoptosis. Thus, EphB6 may play an important role in regulating thymocyte differentiation and modulating responses of mature T cells.

T cell receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase fibroblast growth factor receptor phosphate-buffered saline fluorescein isothiocyanate interleukin guanine exchange factor c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase Eph receptors represent the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, with at least 14 members (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar, 2Pasquale E.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ephs are activated by a group of ligands, all membrane-anchored either by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (ephrin-A1–A5) or a trans-membrane domain (ephrin-B1–B3) (3Drescher U. Curr Biol. 1997; 7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eph receptors are divided into two groups EphA and EphB according to their ligand binding preference; although within a group receptor-ligand specificity is degenerate (4Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is a characteristic of the Eph receptor family that their ligands must be membrane bound to be active (5Davis S. Gale N.W.

This requirement for membrane anchorage of the ligand makes cell-cell contact an obligatory event for activation of Eph receptors, and consequently, the activated receptors are concentrated in the area of cell-cell contact. In accordance with their membrane-anchored nature, ephrins are also involved in the process of reverse signaling. They interact with cytoplasmic signaling molecules and upon stimulation with appropriate receptors transmit signals inside the cell (8Boyd A.W. Lackmann M. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/112/re20)PubMed Google Scholar). Eph receptors and their ligands are typically most highly expressed in neural and endothelial cells (4Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and most descriptions of their function concern development of the nervous system and angiogenesis (9Frisen J. Holmberg J.

Upon the formation of cell-cell contact, signaling through the Eph receptors results in modulation of integrin activity and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. As a result, Ephs generate adhesive or repulsive signals, and in the neural system guide the movement of axonal growth cones, cell migration, and synapse formation (12Drescher U. Kremoser C.

Uncharacteristically, a recently discovered member of the EphB subfamily, EphB6 is predominantly expressed in the thymus and a subpopulation of mature T lymphocytes (19Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). While structural analysis of EphB6 reveals conservation of the major Eph receptor autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-638 and Tyr-644), there are several critical alterations in its kinase domain. These include substitution of a crucial lysine residue in the ATP binding site, resulting in a receptor without detectable kinase activity (19Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar, 21Matsuoka H. Iwata N. Ito M. Shimoyama M. Nagata A. Chihara K. Takai S. Matsui T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 235: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that stimulation with ephrin-B1 induces EphB6 trans-phosphorylation by a catalytically active EphB partner and thus initiates its signaling (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The predominant expression of EphB6 in the thymus (19Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar) and a subset of T lymphocytes (20Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) indicates that it may play an important role in regulation of both T cell differentiation and function. Current evidence suggests that Eph receptors may interact with the T cell receptor (TCR)1 signaling pathways as Eph receptors can regulate the activity of small GTPases (23Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent observations suggest that EphB6 interacts with a key member of TCR signaling pathways, c-Cbl (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 36Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and that co-cross-linking of EphB6 and CD3 with antibodies increases apoptotic cell death in Jurkat T cells (36Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that stimulation of thymocytes with the EphB6 ligand ephrin-B1 (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) prevents major TCR-induced responses such as IL-2 secretion and up-regulation of IL-2 receptor α-chain (CD25) expression. In agreement with previously published data (37Bassiri H. Carding S.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5945-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the blockage of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) signaling in thymocytes significantly inhibits TCR-mediated apoptotic cell death. This response to ephrin-B1 is most likely mediated by the EphB6 receptor as overexpression of EphB6 in Jurkat cells strongly suppresses TCR-mediated IL-2 cytokine secretion and IL-2R expression, an effect further enhanced by ephrin-B1 stimulation. We show here that stimulation of Jurkat T cells with ephrin-B1 or overexpression of the EphB6 receptor results in the selective inhibition of TCR-mediated activation of JNK but not the MAPK pathway. EphB6 appears to suppress the JNK pathway by preventing TCR-induced activation of the small GTPase Rac1, a critical event in initiating the JNK cascade (38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The requirement for EphB6-specific signaling in modulation of TCR pathways was confirmed by the inability of the EphB6 receptor with its cytoplasmic domain deleted (ΔEphB6) to inhibit TCR-induced JNK activation and cellular responses. Moreover, ΔEphB6 demonstrated dominant negative properties and suppressed the inhibitory influence of the endogenous EphB6 receptor. In sum, these findings strongly suggest that the EphB6 receptor alters TCR-mediated responses through inhibition of the Rac1 GTPase. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine and PAK-1 PBD-agarose beads were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to EphB6, Myc, phospho-MAPK, MAPK, JNK, Rac1, and Lck were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase, and anti-p70 S6 kinase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Soluble ephrin-B1 and FGFR-Fc were purchased from R&D Systems. Anti-human CD3ε was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK) or BD Biosciences (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Cells were lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Antibodies and protein G-Sepharose were added to cleared lysates and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 7% non-fat milk (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) in PBS. Immunoblotting antibodies were added at optimal dilutions in PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and LumiGlo chemiluminescent reagents (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). cDNA for EphB6, was cloned from normal human thymocyte RNA by reverse transcription-PCR into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. ΔEphB6- deletion of the cytoplasmic tail was created by PCR using cloned cDNA as the template. The resulting cDNA was cloned and sequenced to confirm the mutation. Myc-tagged EphB6 was generated by PCR by insertion of a Myc tag, and constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression of wild type proteins and mutants were examined by transfection in COS-7 cells and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies. The human T-cell line Jurkat was transfected with empty pcDNA3, EphB6-M, or ΔEphB6. The Jurkat cells were electroporated in 400 μl complete RPMI medium with 30 μg of DNA by pulsing once for 65 ms at 260 V (BTK electrosquare porator, BTX, Division of Genetronics Inc., San Diego, CA). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before addition of G418 to the medium. After 30 days of selection the resulting oligoclonal cell populations were screened by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc and Western blotting with anti-Myc or anti-EphB6 and the EphB6- or ΔEphB6-expressing cell population was selected. Thymuses were obtained from female BALB/c mice, 5–7 weeks old. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. Adherent cells were removed by incubation to plastic dishes for 60 min at 37 °C. The resulting thymocytes are typically >95% CD3. All animal-involved experiments were conducted according to Canadian federal regulations and Hospital of Sick Children guidelines. Ephrin-B1-Fc and anti-CD3 were immobilized at the concentration of 20 μg/ml, unless otherwise indicated, on plastic tissue culture dishes for 1.5 h at 37 °C and remaining soluble protein was removed by three washes with PBS. Human IgG or irrelevant FGFR-Fc fusion protein were immobilized at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in all ephrin-B1-negative cases as a control for the nonspecific effects of the Fc portion of Ephrin-B1-Fc fusion protein. Concentrations of human IgG were adjusted where required to keep protein concentration constant. Although murine ephrin-B1 was utilized, this effectively induced human EphB6 phosphorylation (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 0.5% serum for 20 h with or without immobilized ephrin-B1-Fc fusion protein and immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Irrelevant antibody or FGFR-Fc fusion protein were used as a control for immobilized ephrin-B1 where necessary. The expression of CD25 was then analyzed by staining with phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD25 and isotype control (Immunotech). Cells were stimulated as indicated for 20 h at 37 °C, and conditioned media collected. IL-2 concentrations in the collected samples were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stimulated as indicated for 20 h at 37 °C and stained with annexin V-FITC, and annexin-positive cells were detected by flow cytometry. Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kits from R&D Systems were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The EphB6 receptor was reported to be predominantly expressed in thymocytes (19Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary expression of its ligands was also detected in the thymus (4Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggesting that EphB6 may play a role in T cell differentiation. CD4+8+ double positive thymocytes that express productively rearranged TCRαβ are susceptible to repertoire selection. Double positive thymocytes reacting with self-MHC/antigen complex with high affinity are negatively selected and die by apoptosis. A TCR-induced IL-2/IL-2R autocrine loop, among other factors, contributes significantly to the induction of apoptosis in self-reacting double positive thymocytes (37Bassiri H. Carding S.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5945-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Stimulation of thymocytes with a high concentration of immobilized anti-CD3 can mimic this process and induce apoptosis in thymocytes (39Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.P. Graef I. Karin M. Wagner E.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As expected, stimulation of murine thymocytes with immobilized anti-CD3-induced IL-2 secretion and up-regulation of IL-2R α chain (CD25) expression (Fig. 1,A and B). To examine the possible involvement of Eph receptors in the regulation of these responses we simultaneously stimulated thymocytes with the EphB6 ligand ephrin-B1. Dimeric ephrin-B1 fused to the Fc domain of human IgG was immobilized to mimic its membrane-bound nature. Purified human IgG was used in all points without ephrin-B1 as a specificity control. Co-stimulation with ephrin-B1 strongly inhibited both TCR-mediated IL-2 secretion and CD25 up-regulation (Fig. 1, A and B). The inhibition of T cell response was ephrin-B1 concentration-dependant and ligand immobilization at 2–5 μg/ml was sufficient for significant suppression of TCR-mediated responses (Fig. 1 C). An additional specificity control with irrelevant FGFR-Fc fusion protein had no effect even when immobilized at 10 μg/ml (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with its inhibitory effect on TCR-mediated induction of the IL-2/IL-2R autocrine loop in thymocytes, ephrin-B1 treatment strongly inhibited TCR-initiated apoptosis (Fig. 1 D). Thus, ephrin-B1 and its receptors, potentially including the highly expressed EphB6, can negatively modulate TCR-induced responses in thymocytes. A high level of EphB6 receptor expression has been reported not only in thymocytes, but also in a subpopulation of mature T cells and in the T cell line Jurkat (20Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ligands for the EphB6 receptor, ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Munthe E. Rian E. Holien T. Rasmussen A. Levy F.O. Aasheim H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), are expressed in most organs and cell types (4Zhou R. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 151-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and therefore the potential for T cells to be activated through EphB6 upon cell-cell contact is high. The persistent expression of EphB6 across the T cell lineage, combined with the practically ubiquitous expression of its ligands, suggests that EphB6 might not be important only during differentiation but also in mature T cell function. T lymphocyte homeostasis is precisely regulated with numerous TCR co-stimulatory events required for finely tuned control of cell fate, these signals regulating both proliferative and apoptotic pathways (41Chambers C.A. Allison J.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In particular, stimulation of the TCR can lead to the induction of IL-2 production and CD25 (IL-2Rα) expression, resulting in an autocrine loop and thus the clonal expansion of activated T cells. To examine whether the EphB6 receptor, specifically, could down-regulate TCR-mediated induction of IL-2 and IL-2R, we generated stable overexpression of Myc-tagged EphB6 in the mature T cell line Jurkat (B6-J cells) (Fig. 2 A). We have previously determined that upon stimulation with ephrin-B1, EphB6 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by catalytically active Eph receptors (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3823-3828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As a test for functionality of the transfected EphB6 receptor, the oligoclonal B6-J cell line was stimulated with ephrin-B1, and the overexpressed receptor was indeed observed to undergo tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B). To determine if the EphB6 receptor could influence responses to TCR activation, pcDNA3-transfected control and B6-J cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 and ephrin-B1 and the secretion of IL-2 was examined by ELISA. In agreement with recent observations, immobilized anti-CD3 was sufficient to induce IL-2 expression (38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Nemorin J.G. Laporte P. Berube G. Duplay P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4408-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, a significant inhibition of anti-CD3-induced IL-2 production was observed upon stimulation of control cells with ephrin-B1 (Fig.3 A) in accordance with the high level of endogenous EphB6 expression reported in those cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of EphB6 strongly suppressed induction of IL-2 secretion by anti-CD3 in B6-J cells. This inhibitory effect was further enhanced upon ephrin-B1 stimulation. The induction of CD25 expression in control and B6-J cells was also examined (Fig. 3 B). Once again, a significant inhibition of anti-CD3-induced CD25 up-regulation was observed upon both ephrin-B1 stimulation and overexpression of EphB6. In addition to using human IgG as a control for the human Fc portion of the recombinant ephrin-B1, an irrelevant fusion protein control (FGFR-Fc) was included (Fig.3 C). In sum, these findings show that the EphB6 receptor can inhibit TCR-mediated IL-2 secretion and CD25 expression in mature T cells, suggesting that EphB6 may be responsible for the similar pattern of inhibition induced by ephrin-B1 in thymocytes. The JNK pathway is one of the major signaling cascades initiated upon TCR activation (35Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.P. Graef I. Karin M. Wagner E.F. J. Exp.

Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine if the EphB6 receptor could down-regulate TCR-mediated activation of the JNK pathway, we treated control pcDNA3 cells and B6-J cells with anti-CD3 alone or in combination with increasing concentrations of ephrin-B1 and determined the activation status of JNK by Western blotting with anti-phospho-JNK. Stimulation with immobilized anti-CD3 induced JNK activation in agreement with recent findings using pre-complexed anti-CD3 (38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Anti-CD3-induced p54Jun kinase phosphorylation was prominent in control cells but reduced upon stimulation with ephrin-B1 in a concentration-dependent manner. Induction of JNK phosphorylation was also significantly inhibited in B6-J cells and further down-regulated upon ephrin-B1 stimulation (Fig. 4, A andB). TCR-mediated stimulation of the JNK pathway requires activation of the small GTPase Rac1 by the GEF protein Vav1. This activation occurs upon direct Vav-Rac1 interaction (38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As Eph receptors have previously been shown to regulate small GTPases, in particular through the control of GEF activity (23Shamah S.M. Lin M.Z. Goldberg J.L. Estrach S. Sahin M. Hu L. Bazalakova M. Neve R.L. Corfas G. Debant A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 2001; 105: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 24Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we examined whether the EphB6 receptor could affect Vav interaction with Rac1 in T cells. In pcDNA3 control cells anti-CD3 stimulation induced Vav-Rac1 association, which could be detected by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 C). However, the induction of Vav-Rac1 interaction was blocked by both ephrin-B1 stimulation and EphB6 overexpression. Activated Rac1 interacts with the PAK serine/threonine kinase and induces its autophosphorylation and activation. We could not detect Rac1 activation in PAK pull-down assays (exploiting PAK1–1 PBD beads) upon stimulation with anti-CD3, probably due to insufficient sensitivity of the assay. More potent anti-CD3/anti-CD28 co-stimulation was found to induce Rac1 activation (Fig. 4 D). Overexpression of the EphB6 receptor and ephrin-B1 stimulation strongly suppressed anti-CD3/CD28-initiated activation of Rac1. In agreement, anti-CD3/CD28-induced IL-2 secretion was also inhibited upon EphB6 overexpression (not shown). In sum, these findings suggest that EphB6 inhibits TCR-induced IL-2 secretion and activation of JNK through the control over Rac1 activity. In addition to inducing JNK activation, TCR stimulation also results in the initiation of the MAPK signaling pathway, leading to phosphorylation of MAPK and its consequent activation. As certain Eph receptors have been previously reported to down-regulate activation of the MAPK pathway in non-lymphoid cells (25Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M. Li Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 26Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we examined the influence of the EphB6 receptor on anti-CD3-induced MAPK phosphorylation. Remarkably, attenuation of anti-CD3-initiated signaling by EphB6 appeared to specifically target the JNK pathway as TCR-mediated MAPK phosphorylation was not affected by overexpression of the EphB6 receptor (Fig. 5 A). However, ephrin-B1 stimulation caused a minor inhibition of MAPK activation, probably mediated by other members of the EphB subfamily (some of which have been shown to inhibit MAPK activation (26Elowe S. Holland S.J. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7429-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)). Moreover, anti-CD3-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase on Thr-421/Ser-424 residues, crucial for kinase activation and cell cycle progression, was not affected by the EphB6 receptor either (Fig.5 B). Thus, EphB6 appears to be a specific negative regulator of TCR-mediated Rac1 and JNK pathway activation, suggesting that the down-regulation of TCR-induced IL-2 secretion upon ephrin-B1 stimulation or EphB6 overexpression probably results from the selective inhibition of the Rac1 GTPase. To confirm that the inhibitory effects of EphB6 overexpression were specific to the EphB6 receptor and did not result from reverse signaling through ephrin-B ligands (potentially expressed in Jurkat cells) or from nonspecific interference with the signaling of other Eph receptors, we compared the consequences of overexpressing wild type and cytoplasmic domain-deleted (ΔEphB6) forms of EphB6 (Fig. 6 A). While oligoclonal B6-J populations were utilized in previous experiments, this should also eliminate the possibility that the effects observed with B6-J cells were due to clonal variation. The functional status and expression level of ΔEphB6 was verified by the ability of ΔEphB6-transfected Jurkat cells (ΔB6-J) to bind recombinant ephrin-B1-Fc ligand, which was greater than control cells and equivalent to B6-J cells (not shown). Equal CD3ε expression on B6-J, ΔB6-J, and pcDNA3 cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (not shown). In contrast to the overexpression of wild-type EphB6, expression of ΔEphB6 did not inhibit TCR-mediated responses. Moreover, although we did not detect any increase in Vav-Rac1 association in ΔB6-J (not shown), probably due to low sensitivity of the assays, ΔB6-J cells demonstrated significantly increased responses to anti-CD3 stimulation relative to control cells (Fig. 6,B, C, and D). This suggests that ΔEphB6 may act as dominant negative toward endogenous EphB6 receptors, releasing the cell from their basal inhibitory effects. In agreement, ΔEphB6 also reduced to varying degrees the inhibitory effects of ephrin-B1 stimulation. In sum, these findings strongly suggest that an EphB6-specific signaling cascade is responsible for the attenuation of TCR-mediated responses. Unusually for a receptor tyrosine kinase, and particularly for an Eph receptor, EphB6 is most highly expressed in the T cell lineage (19Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar,20Shimoyama M. Matsuoka H. Tamekane A. Ito M. Iwata N. Inoue R. Chihara K. Furuya A. Hanai N. Matsui T. Growth Factors. 2000; 18: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and recent findings suggested a potential role for EphB6 in modulating T-cell responses (36Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have shown here that both the EphB6 receptor and its ligand ephrin-B1 can regulate TCR-induced IL-2 secretion and IL-2R α-chain expression in T lymphocytes. Ephrin-B1 treatment and EphB6 overexpression also inhibited stimulation of the JNK pathway in anti-CD3-activated cells. The inhibitory properties of EphB6 were confirmed by the ability of a truncated EphB6 receptor, missing its cytoplasmic portion, to suppress the inhibitory activity of the endogenous EphB6 receptor. The inhibition of TCR responses by EphB6 specifically targeted the JNK pathway as essentially no effect on another major signaling cascade, the MAPK pathway, was observed upon either increased EphB6 expression or ephrin-B1 stimulation. Similarly there was no inhibition of anti-CD3-induced p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation. While there is evidence to suggest that production of IL-2 upon TCR engagement requires activation of the JNK signaling cascade (38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Sabapathy K. Kallunki T. David J.P. Graef I. Karin M. Wagner E.F. J. Exp.

Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. Penninger J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), contradictory reports also exist and the precise role of JNK in T cells is currently controversial (35Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Activation of the small GTPase Rac1 is the initiating event in the JNK cascade. Rac1 activation requires interaction with its GEF protein Vav, which can be induced by TCR stimulation (38Kaminuma O. Deckert M. Elly C. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3126-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We found that anti-CD3-induced Rac1-Vav interaction was blocked in B6-J cells or upon stimulation with ephrin-B1. This strongly suggests that EphB6 inhibits JNK pathway initiation and induction of IL-2 secretion by preventing Rac1 activation. This also raises an alternative model of EphB6 action, whereby suppression of TCR-mediated IL-2 secretion may not be the consequence of blockage of the JNK pathway, but rather IL-2 secretion and JNK activation may be down-regulated independently as the result of the inhibition of the Rac1 GTPase. While we were preparing this manuscript findings were published, demonstrating multiple effects of Vav1 deficiency on various anti-CD3-induced responses in Jurkat (44Cao Y. Janssen E.M. Duncan A.W. Altman A. Billadeau D.D. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4809-4819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of JNK and the IL-2 promoter were strongly inhibited in Vav1-defficient cells, while anti-CD3-initiated MAPK phosphorylation was unaffected. These observations essentially mimic the effects of ephrin-B1 stimulation and EphB6 overexpression on anti-CD3-induced responses observed in our experiments in Jurkat. This strongly, although indirectly, supports our model suggesting that the EphB6 receptor may inhibit certain TCR-mediated responses through the control over Rac1 activity. The precise mechanism by which EphB6 regulates Vav-Rac1 interaction remains unclear. Overexpression of the EphB6 receptor did not appear to affect Vav tyrosine phosphorylation or its association with c-Cbl (not shown). However, we and others have demonstrated that EphB6 is constitutively associated with c-Cbl (22Freywald A. Sharfe N. Roifman C.M. J. Biol.

Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), EphB6 could potentially control Vav-Rac1 interaction through regulation of Cbl activity. In mature T cells blockage of the JNK pathway was reported to enhance TCR-induced Fas-mediated apoptosis (46Nishina H. Radvanyi L. Raju K. Sasaki T. Kozieradzki I. Penninger J.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3416-3420PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with the EphB6-mediated inhibition of the JNK pathway observed in our experiments, stimulation of Jurkat T cells with an anti-EphB6 antibody was recently reported to increase anti-CD3-induced Fas-mediated apoptosis (36Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Supporting this observation, we found that overexpression of EphB6 not only prevented TCR-induced IL-2 secretion but also increased the initiation of Fas-dependent apoptotic cell death in an ephrin-B1-dependent manner (not shown). Thus, one of the functions of EphB6 in mature T cells may be control over the clonal expansion of antigen-activated T lymphocytes through suppression of Rac1 activation and subsequent inhibition of the JNK pathway and IL-2 secretion, leading to the induction of apoptosis without preceding proliferation. Clearly, whenever an EphB6-positive T lymphocyte encounters and interacts with a cell expressing ephrins complementary to the EphB6 receptor, signaling through the TCR has the potential to be modified as a consequence of simultaneous EphB6-ephrin ligation. The EphB6 ligands ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 are widely expressed throughout the body and therefore only EphB6 expression by T cells should be a limiting factor in this interaction. This potentially means that the decision to express EphB6 or not is equivalent to a decision to proliferate or die upon subsequent TCR stimulation. We propose that in mature T cells, EphB6 may either help to eliminate potentially harmful clones or simply control clone expansion. Thymocytes that reach the double positive (CD4+8+) stage of maturation and express a successfully rearranged TCR undergo positive or negative selection in the cortical area of thymus. Thymocytes that express a TCR that interacts weakly with self-MHC/antigen are positively selected, whereas strongly activated thymocytes undergo negative selection. The formation of an IL-2/IL-2R autocrine loop appears to be one of the crucial events in initiation of apoptosis in negative selection (37Bassiri H. Carding S.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5945-5954Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By definition, organization of an autocrine signaling loop depends strictly on both ligand secretion and expression of a complementary receptor. Stimulation with ephrin-B1 appeared to block TCR-mediated induction of both IL-2 secretion and IL-2R α-chain expression in thymocytes. As expected, anti-CD3-induced apoptosis was similarly disrupted. Since each ephrin can activate multiple members of the Eph family, we cannot be absolutely certain that the EphB6 receptor was predominantly responsible for the transduction of ephrin-B1 inhibitory signals in thymocytes. However, EphB6 is activated by stimulation with ephrin-B1 (12Drescher U. Kremoser C. Handwerker C. Loschinger J. Noda M. Bonhoeffer F. Cell. 1995; 82: 359-370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar), and the highest level of EphB6 expression is found in thymocytes (19Gurniak C.B. Berg L.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 777-786PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of EphB6 enhances ephrin-B1-induced inhibition of TCR-mediated responses in Jurkat cells, strongly suggesting that EphB6 is likely to be the primary ephrin-B1 effector in thymocytes. It is possible that one of the functions of the EphB6 receptor and its ephrin-B ligands in the thymus is to modulate TCR signaling in a manner that prevents induction of apoptosis by low affinity TCR interactions but does not affect TCR survival signals. This possibility is supported by our observation that in thymocytes (similarly to Jurkat cells) ephrin-B1 stimulation, although inhibiting IL-2 secretion, does not significantly affect TCR-mediated MAPK pathway activation (not shown), a major survival signal in CD4+CD8+ cells (35Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2490-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Complementing these observations, expression of the EphB6 receptor was found by in situ hybridization analysis to be restricted to the cortex in both murine and human thymus (36Luo H. Wan X. Wu Y. Wu J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1362-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) 2C. Rashotte, T. Grunberger, and C. M. Roifman, unpublished observations. where CD4+CD8+ cells predominate and selection takes place. In sum, these findings suggest that in thymocytes stimulation with EphB6 receptor ligands may allow suboptimal TCR stimulation to switch on survival signals without triggering apoptotic events. Thus, the ability of the EphB6 receptor to inhibit TCR-mediated JNK activation and IL-2/IL-2R production without a significant effect on the MAPK pathway may serve to mark the fine line between the positive and negative selection of CD4+CD8+thymocytes.

Sphingolipid signaling has been shown to regulate a variety of cellular processes and has been implicated in collagen gene regulation. The present study was undertaken to determine whether endogenous sphingolipids are involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β treatment induced endogenous ceramide levels in a time-dependent manner within 5–15 min of cell stimulation. Using human fibroblasts transfected with a α2(I) collagen promoter/reporter gene construct (COL1A2), C6-ceramide (10 μm) exerted a stimulatory effect on basal and TGF-β-induced activity of this promoter. Next, to define the effects of endogenous sphingolipids on TGF-β signaling we employed ectopic expression of enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Sphingosine 1-phosphate phosphatase (YSR2) stimulated basal COL1A2 promoter activity and cooperated with TGF-β in activation of this promoter. Furthermore, overexpression of YSR2 resulted in the pronounced increase of COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNA levels. Conversely, overexpression of sphingosine kinase (SPHK1) inhibited basal and TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 promoter activity. These results suggest that endogenous ceramide, but not sphingosine or sphingosine 1-phosphate, is a positive regulator of collagen gene expression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Smad3 is a target of YSR2. TGF-β-induced Smad3 phosphorylation was elevated in the presence of YSR2. Cotransfection of YSR2 with wild-type Smad3, but not with the phosphorylation-deficient mutant of Smad3 (Smad3A), resulted in a dramatic increase of COL1A2 promoter activity.

Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref Google Scholar). TGF-β plays a critical role in regulating immune cell function, epithelial cell growth, and extracellular matrix deposition (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar). Abnormal TGF-β signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including cancer and fibrosis (3Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Google Scholar). TGF-β signals through a heteromeric receptor complex of type I and type II receptor serine-threonine kinases. Intracellular signal transducers termed Smads transmit signals from the receptor to the nucleus. The members of the Smad family have been divided into three functional subgroups: receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), the common mediator Smads (co-Smads), and inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). R-Smads (Smad2 or -3) are phosphorylated on a conserved SSXS motif by the activated type I receptor leading to their dissociation from the receptor. Subsequently, they form heterocomplexes with co-Smads and upon translocation into the nucleus contribute to transcriptional regulation of the target genes (1Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref Google Scholar). A Smad-interacting membrane-bound protein SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) facilitates binding of the Smad2/3 to the activated type I receptor (4Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that interaction of SARA with Smads occurs in early endosomes (5Penheiter S.G. Mitchell H. Garamszegi N. Edens M. Dore Jr., J.J. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4750-4759Google Scholar, 6Panopoulou E. Gillooly D.J. Wrana J.L. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Murphy C. Fotsis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18046-18052Google Scholar). Another endosomal FYVE domain protein, Hgs, has also been shown to cooperate with SARA in recruiting Smad2 and Smad3 to the activin receptor complex (7Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Google Scholar). Interestingly, translocation of Smads to the nucleus can be blocked by phosphorylation of the linker region of R-Smads by Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (8Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Massague J. Nature. 1997; 389: 618-622Google Scholar), suggesting that Smads can be directly targeted by other signaling pathways. There is also increasing evidence for cross-talk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways (9Wakefield L.M. Roberts A.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 22-29Google Scholar). Sphingolipids, in addition to their role as structural molecules of the plasma membrane, are now recognized as important bioactive mediators of a variety of cellular processes (10Spiegel S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Google Scholar, 11Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Google Scholar, 12Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Google Scholar). In particular, biologic functions of ceramide, sphingosine, and their phosphates have been extensively studied. Intracellular ceramide is primarily generated via hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by a family of sphingomyelinases. In addition, ceramide can be formed from sphingosine by ceramide synthase. Sphingosine can be further converted to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by the action of sphingosine kinase (SPHK1). On the other hand, S1P phosphatase dephosphorylates S1P back to sphingosine (Fig.1). The yeast S1P phosphatase, YSR2 (yeast sphingosine resistance gene), which has a high degree of specificity, has recently been cloned and characterized (13Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Google Scholar). It has been shown that overexpression of YSR2 in yeast increased ceramide formation. Conversely, deletion of YSR2 decreased ceramide levels (14Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathways of sphingoid bases, their phosphates, and ceramide are conserved for the most part from yeast to mammals. It was shown that mammalian S1P phosphatase was able to substitute for YSR2 when expressed in mutant yeast lacking YSR2 function (15Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that S1P phosphatase may play an important role in altering the balance between ceramide and intracellular S1P. Significantly, ceramide and S1P appear to have antagonistic functions, particularly in the regulation of cell growth. Ceramide, which is induced by inflammatory cytokines, various damaging agents, and stress signals, seems to be mainly associated with cell growth arrest and apoptosis, whereas intracellular S1P has been shown to promote cell proliferation (10Spiegel S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Google Scholar, 11Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Google Scholar). It is important to note that the effects of ceramide and S1P on cell growth and other cellular functions are cell type-specific. Previous studies have suggested that ceramide may also be involved in regulation of collagen metabolism. It was shown that C2-ceramide and sphingomyelinase inhibit collagen gene expression in hepatic stellate cells and dermal fibroblasts (16Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Google Scholar, 17Hernandez-Munoz I. de la Torre P. Sanchez-Alcazar J.A. Garcia I. Santiago E. Munoz-Yague M.T. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 625-640Google Scholar). Furthermore, C2-ceramide suppressed α2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter activity (16Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Google Scholar). Because elevated collagen production is associated with fibrotic diseases and TGF-β is a primary inducer of collagen, this study was undertaken to examine the possible role of sphingolipids in TGF-β regulation of collagen production. Using exogenous S1P and C6-ceramide and enzymatic manipulation of endogenous sphingolipids, we demonstrate that intracellular sphingolipids modulate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the effects of sphingolipids are Smad3-dependent. This study establishes for the first time direct functional interaction between TGF-β and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Foreskin fibroblast cultures were established from newborn foreskins obtained from delivery suites of local hospitals. Tissue was dissociated enzymatically by 0.25% collagenase type I (Sigma) and 0.05% DNase (Sigma) in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS, Mv1Lu, and HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The COL1A2-luciferase construct contains sequences from −353 to +58 bp of the human COL1A2 promoter (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Google Scholar) fused to the luciferase reporter gene (pGL2 basic, Promega). Cloning of YSR2 has been described previously (13Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Google Scholar, 14Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Google Scholar). The open reading frame of YSR2 was recloned into KpnI and EcoR1 sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The EGFP coding sequence was amplified from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and inserted into HindIII and KpnI sites upstream of YSR2. p3TP-Lux was a gift from J. Massagué (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The expression construct for the constitutively active form of TGF-β type I receptor (HA-TβRI(TD)) was provided by K. Miyazono (University of Tokyo). Expression vectors for Smad3 and Smad3A, which carry three carboxyl-terminal serine-to-alanine substitutions, were gifts from H. Lodish (Whitehead Institute, MA). SPHK1a was subcloned as described by Olivera et al. (19Olivera A. Kohama T. Tu Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12576-12583Google Scholar) into pcDNA3.1 vector. Adenoviral vectors expressing YSR2 and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated using a published protocol (20He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA encoding YSR2 was cloned into the shuttle vector pAdTRACK-CMV, which contains a GFP expression cassette driven by a separate CMV promoter. The shuttle vector containing YSR2 was cotransformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with the AdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone plasmid, which lacks the E1 and E3 regions of the adenoviral genome. Linearized recombinant plasmid DNA was transfected into 293 cells, an adenoviral packaging cell line, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to generate the recombinant adenovirus expressing YSR2 and GFP from separate CMV promoters (AdYSR2). An adenovirus expressing GFP alone (AdGFP) was generated via the same method for use as a control vector. For transient transfection, 60–80% confluent cells in 6-well plates were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagents (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's recommendations. After transfection, cells were incubated for 20 h and stimulated where indicated for an additional 24 h with TGF-β (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), C6-ceramide, S1P, or sphingosine (synthesized as described in Ref. 21Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 499-518Google Scholar). Luciferase activities in the cell lysates were measured with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Human fibroblasts (5 × 104) were plated in 10% fetal calf serum/DMEM in 6-well plates. Next day, cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent with either empty vector or YSR2. 20 h after transfection, the number of GFP-positive cells was visually determined using a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. Efficiency of transfection in dermal fibroblasts varied from 5 to 15%. Experiments in which efficiency of transfection was below 10% were not continued. Medium was changed to 1% fetal bovine serum/DMEM, and TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) was added for an additional 24 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (22Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Google Scholar). Filters were sequentially hybridized with radioactive probes for COL1A1, COL1A2, and 18 S ribosomal RNA. The filters were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For determination of phosphorylation levels of ectopically expressed Smad3, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody followed by adsorption to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. After immunoblotting with the anti-phosphoserine antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), the membranes were subjected to re-blotting with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma) antibody to confirm levels of expression of the FLAG-tagged Smad3 protein. To determine levels of expression of the receptors, aliquots of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To determine the kinetics of phosphorylation of endogenous Smad3, Mv1Lu cells or dermal fibroblasts were treated with TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for various time intervals. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Smad2/3 antibody (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by adsorption to protein G-Sepharose. Western blotting was performed using an anti-phosphoserine antibody. As loading control, membranes were subjected to re-blotting using an antibody against Smad3 (FL-425, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Foreskin fibroblasts were transiently transfected with either SPHK1a or empty vector. After a 24-h incubation in DMEM/1% fetal bovine serum, cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mmβ-glycero-phosphate, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor. Sphingosine kinase activity was determined in the presence of 50 μm sphingosine, dissolved in 5% Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.25%), and [32P]ATP (10 μCi, 1 mm) containing MgCl2 (10 mm) as described in Ref. 23Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Google Scholar. The labeled S1P was identified by thin layer chromatography with 1-butanol/ethanol/acetic acid/water (80:20:10:20) and visualized by autoradiography. Phosphatase activity was measured as previously described (15Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 cells were transfected with either YSR2 or empty vector. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in buffer A (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor), and cells were scraped on ice. Cells were subsequently freeze-thawed seven times, then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Supernatants were removed, and the membrane fractions were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A and homogenized. 32P-labeled S1P was prepared by in vitro phosphorylation of sphingosine using cell lysates obtained from 293 cells overexpressing SPHK1. Alternatively,d-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (ARC, Inc.) was used as a substrate. Similar results were obtained with both substrates. S1P phosphatase activity was measured by adding32P-labeled S1P to 20 μg of membrane preparations in 200 μl of buffer A and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The assay was terminated by adding 20 μl of 1N HCl, and lipids extracted with 0.8 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:200:1). To separate phases, 0.24 ml of chloroform and 0.24 ml of 2 m KCl were added. After centrifugation, 100 μl of the aqueous layer was counted by liquid scintillation. Remaining 32P-labeled S1P was extracted and analyzed by TLC. Mv1Lu cells or dermal fibroblasts were grown to near confluence, and culture medium was changed to serum-free DMEM for 24 h, followed by stimulation with TGF-β1 (2.5 ng/ml) for various time intervals. Lipids were then extracted with chloroform/methanol/water and processed for determination of ceramide as described (24Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Google Scholar). Modulation of ceramide levels by a variety of stimuli has been observed in many cell types; however, only limited information is currently available regarding TGF-β regulation of ceramide (25Goldkorn T. Ding T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; : 461-472Google Scholar). To examine whether ceramide is involved in TGF-β signaling, we measured ceramide levels in cells treated with TGF-β for various time intervals. Ceramide measurements were performed in human dermal fibroblasts and in Mv1Lu cells. Both cell types responded in a similar manner with a rapid increase of the ceramide levels in response to TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 2 A, ceramide increased 5 min after TGF-β addition, peaked by 10 min, and very slowly declined over the next 2 h. We also examined phosphorylation of Smad3 in cells treated with TGF-β for the same time intervals (Fig.2 B). Detectable phosphorylation of Smad3 occurred at 10 min after TGF-β addition, with the peak phosphorylation between 20–60 min and a decline at 120 min. These results indicate that TGF-β treatment leads to a relatively rapid induction of endogenous ceramide. Furthermore, generation of ceramide preceded Smad3 phosphorylation, raising the possibility that ceramide may be involved in TGF-β signaling. Because our laboratory is particularly interested in defining TGF-β signaling pathways relevant to fibrosis, we utilized a well characterized COL1A2 promoter reporter construct to delineate the role of ceramide in TGF-β regulation of matrix genes (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Google Scholar, 22Ihn H. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24666-24672Google Scholar, 26Greenwel P. Tanaka S. Penkov D. Zhang W. Olive M. Moll J. Vinson C. Di Liberto M. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 912-918Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that TGF-β stimulation of this promoter is Smad3-dependent (27Zhang W. Ou J. Inagaki Y. Greenwel P. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39237-39245Google Scholar, 28Chen S.J. Yuan W. Lo S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 381-392Google Scholar). We first examined the effects of exogenously added sphingolipids on the basal and TGF-β-dependent COL1A2 promoter activity. Dermal fibroblasts were transfected with the COL1A2 promoter and treated with S1P (10–30 μm), C6-ceramide (10–50 μm), and sphingosine (1 μm) in the presence or absence of TGF-β. S1P at micromolar concentrations slightly stimulated basal and TGF-β-induced COL1A2 promoter activity (Fig.3 A), whereas nanomolar doses of S1P had no effect on the COL1A2 promoter (data not shown). C6-ceramide (10 μm) stimulated COL1A2 promoter activity with an effect comparable with that of TGF-β, a known inducer of collagen gene transcription (Fig. 3 B). Simultaneous addition of C6-ceramide (10 μm) and TGF-β resulted in a further increase of the COL1A2 promoter activity. On the other hand, C6-ceramide at a higher concentration (50 μm) did not affect basal promoter levels and decreased TGF-β-induced COL1A2 promoter activity (Fig.3 B). Sphingosine (1 μm) had no effect on the COL1A2 promoter activity in the presence or absence of TGF-β (Fig.3 C). Higher concentrations of sphingosine were toxic. These experiments suggest that sphingolipids may be modulators of the basal and TGF-β-dependent COL1A2 promoter activity in dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, ceramide had both stimulatory (at lower doses) and inhibitory (at higher doses) effects. One possible interpretation of these results is based on the current view of the dynamic balance between intracellular levels of ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P (10Spiegel S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 341-344Google Scholar). Because the relative ratio of endogenous ceramide and S1P is tightly controlled, the stimulatory effect of high concentrations of S1P may be because of its conversion to ceramide. Also, the failure of S1P to act in nanomolar range argues against its effects being mediated through the S1P receptors and further supports intracellular action, which would include metabolic interconversion as a distinct possibility. Conversely, inhibitory effects of high doses of ceramide may reflect its metabolism to S1P or other inhibitory intermediates. Together, the experiments using exogenous sphingolipids suggest that balance between components of sphingolipid pathway may be important for collagen gene regulation. To gain more understanding into the nature of endogenous sphingolipids involved in TGF-β signaling, we took advantage of the availability of recombinant enzymes involved in regulation of the balance between S1P and ceramide (see Fig. 1). First, we utilized YSR2 to generate endogenous ceramide. YSR2 specifically dephosphorylates S1P to sphingosine, which is then converted to ceramide. Control experiments indicated that cell lysates prepared from cells ectopically expressing YSR2 contained higher levels of S1P phosphatase activity as compared with cell lysates obtained from cells expressing empty vector (Fig.4 A). We also determined that ectopic expression of YSR2 elevates endogenous ceramide levels (Fig.7 D). Overexpression of YSR2 in dermal fibroblasts led to a modest but consistent induction of the COL1A2 promoter activity. Significantly, TGF-β stimulation of this promoter was greatly potentiated by the presence of YSR2 (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether activation by YSR2 is specific for the COL1A2 promoter or whether YSR2 is a general coactivator of the TGF-β pathway, we used a TGF-β-responsive artificial reporter system (p3TP-Lux promoter). YSR2 induced basal activity of the p3TP-Lux promoter and synergized with TGF-β in activation of this promoter, suggesting a general effect of YSR2 on the TGF-β signaling pathway (Fig. 4 C).Figure 7Smad3 is a target of YSR2 action. A, foreskin fibroblasts were transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of the wild-type Smad3 (WT) or phosphorylation-deficient Smad3, (Smad3A(3A)) or the empty vector along with the COL1A2 promoter construct (0.9 μg). Luciferase activity was determined following treatment of fibroblasts with TGF-β (5 ng/ml) for 24 h. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments done in duplicate. B, TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad3 is enhanced by YSR2. COS cells were transfected with FLAG-Smad3 in the presence or absence of HA-TβRI(TD) and YSR2. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine (P-ser) antibody. The membrane was re-blotted with anti-FLAG antibody. Aliquots of cell lysates were also subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody to detect HA-TβRI(TD). C, adenovirally expressed YSR2 enhances endogenous Smad2/3 phosphorylation level. Fibroblasts were transduced with control GFP-adenovirus or YSR2-adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 70) and next day stimulated with TGF-β. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-Smad2/3 antibody and immunoblotted with either anti-phosphoserine antibody (upper panel) or rabbit anti-Smad3 antibody (lower panel).D, YSR2 induces endogenous ceramide levels. Ceramide levels were measured as described under “Materials and Methods” in cells transduced with control GFP-adenovirus and treated with TGF-β or in cells transduced with YSR2-adenovirus. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of two independent experiments done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined the effects of overexpressing SPHK1 on COL1A2 promoter activity. This enzyme generates S1P by phosphorylating sphingosine. Control experiments indicated that cell lysates prepared from cells ectopically expressing SHPK1 contained higher levels of SPHK1 activity (Fig. 5 A). Overexpression of SHPK1 in dermal fibroblasts slightly decreased both basal and TGF-β-stimulated COL1A2 promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). Together, these experiments indicate that perturbation of the intracellular sphingolipid-ceramide pathway has both positive and negative effects on TGF-β signaling, such that tilting the balance from S1P to ceramide exerts a pronounced stimulatory effect, whereas tilting the balance from ceramide S1P induces a modest inhibitory effect. Next, we examined the effects of the ectopically expressed YSR2 on expression levels of COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNAs in human dermal fibroblasts transiently transfected with YSR2. Both COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNAs were significantly increased in cells transfected with YSR2 as compared with cells transfected with empty vector (Fig.6). Depending on the individual cell line, stimulation of COL1A1 by YSR2 varied from 1.6- to 9.9-fold, whereas stimulation by TFG-β varied from 1.7- to 8.8-fold. When both stimuli were present, an additional modest increase was observed (2.2- 11.3-fold). It should be noted that in human dermal fibroblasts autocrine TGF-β signaling pathway is operational and contributes to basal collagen gene expression (29Kawakami T. Ihn H. Xu W. Smith E. LeRoy C. Trojanowska M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 47-51Google Scholar). Thus, increased COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNA levels in cells transfected with YSR2 may reflect cooperation between YSR2 and low levels of endogenous TGF-β signaling pathway. Presently, we cannot exclude that other signaling pathways that are involved in collagen gene regulation are also affected by YSR2. Smad2 and Smad3 are mediators of TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, we have previously shown that Smad3 mediates TGF-β stimulation of the COL1A2 promoter in dermal fibroblasts (28Chen S.J. Yuan W. Lo S. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 381-392Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the effects of YSR2 on Smad3 stimulation of the COL1A2 promoter. Transfection with Smad3 or YSR2 alone resulted in induction of the promoter activity. However, cotransfection of the COL1A2 promoter with Smad3 and YSR2 led to a dramatic increase in collagen promoter activity (Fig.7 A). Interestingly, cotransfection of Smad3A (a mutant of Smad3 that carries three carboxyl-terminal serine-to-alanine substitutions) (30Liu X. Sun Y. Constantinescu S.N. Karam E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Google Scholar) also produced a modest stimulatory effect. This may be because of activation of endogenous Smad3, or perhaps YSR2 can enhance TGF-β signaling through an additional yet unidentified mechanism. Because recent studies have shown that nuclear import of Smad can occur without phosphorylation on the SSXS motif (31Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Google Scholar), it is possible that the action of a phosphatase facilitates dissociation of Smad3 from SARA. In any case, our data suggest that Smad3 is a major effector of YSR2. Because phosphorylation of C-terminal serine residues of Smad3 is necessary for its activation, we investigated the effect of YSR2 on Smad3 phosphorylation. Using COS cells, Smad3 was coexpressed with the constitutively active form of the TGFβ receptor (TβRI(TD)) in the absence or presence of YSR2. Phosphorylation of Smad3 was detected by immunoblotting using antibodies to phosphorylated serine residues. As previously shown, in the presence of TβRI(TD), Smad3 phosphorylation was observed. YSR2 significantly increased Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig.7 B). This result indicates that YSR2 has an additive or synergistic effect on the intensity of the TGF-β signaling cascade acting at the post-receptor level. To further investigate the role of YSR2 in Smad3 activation, we ectopically expressed YSR2 in human fibroblasts using adenoviral vector. As shown in Fig. 7 C, Smad2/3 was not phosphorylated in unstimulated cells but became rapidly phosphorylated in response to TGF-β stimulation. In contrast, in cells transduced with YSR2, Smad3 became fully phosphorylated even in the absence of TGF-β with no additional increases in phosphorylation after addition of TGF-β. Thus, the endogenous metabolic products of YSR2 (e.g.ceramide) are capable of inducing phosphorylation of Smad3. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of S1P phosphatase results in generation of ceramide (13Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Google Scholar, 14Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Google Scholar, 15Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Google Scholar). The endogenous levels of ceramide were measured in cells transduced either with control-GFP or with YSR2 adenoviruses and compared with cells stimulated with TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 7 D, ceramide levels were similarly induced by YSR2 overexpression or TGF-β treatment. The present study establishes for the first time that endogenous sphingolipids are co-regulators of the TGF-β signaling pathway. The following observations support this conclusion. First, exogenously added C6-ceramide stimulated basal and TGF-β-induced collagen promoter activity. Second, overexpression of the yeast S1P phosphatase had a synergistic effect with TGF-β in activation of the collagen promoter and stimulated endogenous collagen gene. Both the yeast and the murine enzymes have been previously shown to decrease endogenous S1P levels and to increase endogenous ceramide levels (14Mao C. Saba J.D. Obeid L.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 667-675Google Scholar,15Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Google Scholar). On the other hand, TGF-β induction of this promoter was inhibited by overexpression of SPHK1, an enzyme that promotes formation of S1P. More importantly, TGF-β treatment induced endogenous ceramide levels, which correlated with TGF-β-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. These results strongly suggest that ceramide is a coactivator of the TGF-β signaling pathway and that S1P is a possible endogenous inhibitor. We have also begun to unravel the specific regulatory mechanisms involved in the interaction of sphingolipids and TGF-β signaling pathways. We demonstrate by functional assays that the effects of YSR2 are mediated via Smad3. Consistent with these results, Smad3 phosphorylation is increased in the presence of ectopically expressed YSR2. Our results also clarify previous observations indicating an inhibitory role of C2-ceramide in collagen production (16Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Google Scholar, 17Hernandez-Munoz I. de la Torre P. Sanchez-Alcazar J.A. Garcia I. Santiago E. Munoz-Yague M.T. Solis-Herruzo J.A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 625-640Google Scholar). In our study the inhibitory effects of exogenous ceramides on COL1A2 transcription were also observed with higher doses of C6-ceramide. These observations suggest that sphingolipids may have a dual role in collagen gene regulation and that other metabolites with inhibitory functions may also be formed. S1P may be one of the metabolites with the inhibitory function. Our recent studies have shown that exogenously added S1P and lysophosphatidic acid inhibit TGF-β stimulation of collagen mRNA stability. These effects were mediated via MEK/ERK. 2M. Sato and M. Trojanowska, unpublished observations. Induction of the ERK pathway was also responsible for collagen inhibition by C2-ceramide (16Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Google Scholar). Although induction of ERK pathway in response to exogenously added ceramide or SMase has been observed in several experimental systems (11Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Google Scholar), the specific intracellular mediators of this induction are presently unknown. C6-ceramide has also been shown to activate p38 pathway (32Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Google Scholar). In contrast to ERKs, p38 has been shown to cooperate with TGF-β signaling in collagen gene stimulation (33Sato M. Shegogue D. Gore E.A. Smith E.A. McDermott P.J. Trojanowska M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 704-711Google Scholar). However, p38 does not appear to be involved in the effects observed in our study. First, Smad3 is not a direct target of p38 (34Sano Y. Harada J. Tashiro S. Gotoh-Mandeville R. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8949-8957Google Scholar, 35Hanafusa H. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Masuyama N. Nishita M. Fujisawa J. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27161-27167Google Scholar). Second, stimulation of the COL1A2 promoter by YSR2 was insensitive to SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 (data not shown). We could also exclude stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway because it was shown that induction of this pathway down-regulates COL1A2 promoter in dermal fibroblasts (36Fisher G.J. Datta S. Wang Z. Li X.Y. Quan T. Chung J.H. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 663-670Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily, which have been previously shown to mediate many of the ceramide effects, are not involved in the process described here. The question remains about the nature of the interaction between the sphingolipid and TGF-β signaling pathways. It has been demonstrated that both TGF-β receptor type I and type II, which form homodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum, are clustered in the cell surface into discrete cellular subdomains (37Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Google Scholar, 38Gilboa L. Wells R.G. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 767-777Google Scholar). Furthermore, a TGF-β-dependent interaction between TβRI and caveolin-1 has recently been described (39Razani B. Zhang X.L. Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Bottinger E.P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6727-6738Google Scholar). Interestingly, caveolin-1 was shown to suppress TGF-β-mediated Smad2 phosphorylation and subsequent downstream events. It is possible that ceramide may interfere with this interaction, resulting in increased Smad3 phosphorylation. This possibility will be tested in our future studies. Recent studies (5Penheiter S.G. Mitchell H. Garamszegi N. Edens M. Dore Jr., J.J. Leof E.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4750-4759Google Scholar, 6Panopoulou E. Gillooly D.J. Wrana J.L. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Murphy C. Fotsis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18046-18052Google Scholar) suggest that assembly of the TGF-β signaling pathway occurs in early endosomes. Consistent with this possibility, an endosomal protein SARA has been shown to colocalize with TGF-β receptors and recruit Smad to the receptor complex (4Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Google Scholar, 31Xu L. Chen Y.G. Massague J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 559-562Google Scholar, 40Wurmser A.E. Gary J.D. Emr S.D. J. Biol.

Other endosomal proteins, including Hgs (Hrs), may also contribute to TGF-β signaling (7Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that ceramide binds to and activates the endosomal protease, cathepsin D (42Heinrich M. Wickel M. Schneider-Brachert W. Sandberg C. Gahr J. Schwandner R. Weber T. Saftig P. Peters C. Brunner J. Kronke M. Schutze S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5252-5263Google Scholar). Thus, endosomal ceramide may facilitate interaction of the TGF-β receptor complex with SARA and Smad3. Recent studies suggest that the lipid environment may be critical for the proper interactions of the cell surface receptors with downstream signaling molecules (43Liu P. Wang P. Michaely P. Zhu M. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31648-31654Google Scholar). Our data demonstrating increased Smad3 phosphorylation in cells overexpressing YSR2 are consistent with this possibility. Although the specific subcellular localization of the mammalian S1P phosphatase has not been determined, yeast S1P phosphatases have been localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (13Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28690-28694Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility of interaction of this enzyme with TGF-β receptors or components of the TGF-β signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time a role for the endogenous sphingolipid mediators in regulating the TGF-β pathway. Further work is needed to delineate the specific mechanism of this interaction."

It catalyzes the irreversible ॆ-carboxylation of PEP in the presence of Mg2+ and HCO3− to yield oxaloacetate and Pi. PEPC is abundant in C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) leaves where it participates in photosynthesis by catalyzing the initial fixation of atmospheric CO2. Both allosteric mechanisms and covalent modification are involved in PEPC control in C4 and CAM leaves (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Early work established that C4 and CAM PEPCs are controlled by a diurnal cycle that modulates their sensitivity to l-malate inhibition (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.

Although proposed roles for nonphotosynthetic PEPCs are diverse, a crucial PEPC function is the anaplerotic replenishment of citric acid cycle intermediates consumed during biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar). As with C4 and CAM PEPCs, the PEPC of C3leaves and nonphotosynthetic tissues can be controlled by allosteric effectors and reversible phosphorylation (4Duff S.M.G. Chollet R.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Google Scholar), no seed PEPC has been fully purified and thoroughly characterized.Storage lipids account for as much as 657 of the weight of mature castor oilseeds (COS). Triacylglyceride accumulation depends on the synthesis of long chain fatty acids, which in developing oilseeds occurs in specialized plastids termed leucoplasts. This process requires the transport of both sucrose-derived carbon skeletons and energetic intermediates across the plastid envelope (17Rawsthorne S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 41: 182-196Google Scholar).l-Malate supports significant rates of fatty acid synthesis by isolated leucoplasts from developing COS (18Smith R.G. Gauthier D.A. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1233-1238Google Scholar). Malate imported from the cytosol into the leucoplast stroma is mediated by a malate/Pi translocator within the COS leucoplast envelope (19Eastmond P.J. Dennis D.T. Rawsthorne S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 851-856Google Scholar). Sangwan and co-workers (16Sangwan R.S. Singh N. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Google Scholar) hypothesized that the large increase in PEPC activity and concentration that accompanies COS development facilitates malate production for fatty acid synthesis. The increased PEP to malate flux would also serve as an anaplerotic source of C-skeletons for transamination reactions associated with COS storage protein synthesis.The aim of this study was to purify and characterize PEPC from developing COS. Here we present unexpected evidence for two PEPC isoforms from developing COS and examine their structural and kinetic properties. Although one isoform is a typical PEPC homotetramer, the other represents a unique high Mr PEPC complex unprecedented in vascular plants but remarkably reminiscent of Class 2 PEPC isoforms recently described in unicellular green algae (20Rivoal J. Dunford R. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 47-57Google Scholar, 21Rivoal J. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 201-209Google Scholar, 22Rivoal J. Trzos S.

We provide evidence that the association of a common 107-kDa PEPC catalytic subunit with an unrelated but PEPC-like 64-kDa polypeptide is responsible for the dramatic differences in the physical and kinetic properties observed between the PEPC homotetramer and highMr PEPC complex of developing COS.DISCUSSIONWhen partial in vitro proteolysis of p107 was prevented, two COS PEPC isoforms that significantly differed in their physical and kinetic properties were resolved by Superdex 200 FPLC and highly purified. Tissue- and/or developmentally specific PEPC isozymes are known to occur in vascular plants (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar, 2Rajagopalan A., V Devi M.T. Raghavendra A.S. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 115-135Google Scholar, 3Nimmo H.G. Batey N.H. Dickinson H.G. Hetherington S.M.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1993: 161-170Google Scholar), and genetic evidence indicates that developing Glycine max (soybean) andVicia faba seeds express more than one PEPC gene (15Golombek S. Heim U. Horstmann C. Wobus U. Weber H. Planta. 1999; 208: 66-72Google Scholar, 32Sugimoto T. Kawasaki T. Kato T. Whittier R.F. Shibata D. Kawamura Y. Plant Mol.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of two PEPC isoforms from the same plant tissue.COS PEPC1 is a p107 homotetramer, typical of most other plant PEPCs studied to date. By contrast, PEPC2 appears to exist as an unusual 681- kDa hetero-octamer composed of the same p107 found in PEPC1 and an associated p64 that is structurally and immunologically unrelated to p107. Nevertheless, Q-TOF MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides revealed that p64 is highly similar to two putative PEPCs identified by annotation of the rice and Arabidopsis genomes (Fig. 5). Although they contain conserved regions required for PEPC activity, these putative PEPCs exhibit a unique N-terminal region that lacks the regulatory seryl phosphorylation site thought to be conserved among all plant PEPCs (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar) and have predicted molecular masses of 102 (rice) and 110 kDa (Arabidopsis). Although it is feasible that p64 represents an in vivo or in vitro degradation product of a larger polypeptide, the data indicate that p64 is a PEPC-like polypeptide that interacts with p107 to give rise to the COS PEPC2 heteromeric complex. This association may either physically block the allosteric sites of p107 or promote an allosteric transition in p107 such that effectors have limited access to their respective sites.COS PEPC1 and PEPC2 Emulate Green Algal 舠Class 1舡 and 舠Class 2舡 PEPC IsoformsInterestingly, the respective properties of COS PEPC1 and PEPC2 are remarkably comparable with those of the homotetrameric low Mr Class 1 and heteromeric high Mr Class 2 PEPC isoforms of the green algaeSelenastrum minutum and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(20Rivoal J. Dunford R. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 47-57Google Scholar, 21Rivoal J. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 201-209Google Scholar, 22Rivoal J. Trzos S. Gage D.A. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12588-12597Google Scholar). All algal PEPC isoforms share the same 102-kDa catalytic subunit (p102). Similar to COS PEPC2, the algal Class 2 PEPCs also contain associated polypeptides that are immunologically unrelated to p102. MALDI-TOF MS and microsequencing revealed that like the p64 of COS PEPC2, the 130- kDa subunit (p130) of S. minutum Class 2 PEPC represents a distinct PEPC-like polypeptide that is only distantly related to p102 (22Rivoal J. Trzos S. Gage D.A. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12588-12597Google Scholar). Moreover, relative to COS PEPC1 and algal Class 1 PEPCs, the COS PEPC2 and algal Class 2 PEPCs demonstrate significantly enhanced thermal stability and a much lower sensitivity to allosteric effectors and pH changes within the physiological range (20Rivoal J. Dunford R. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 47-57Google Scholar, 21Rivoal J. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 201-209Google Scholar). Taken together, the data imply that high and low MrPEPC isoforms arose in green algae before the evolution of vascular plants, with this feature being conserved as a key structure-function aspect of at least some plant PEPCs.Possible Functions and Interconversion of COS PEPC1 and PEPC2Similar to PEPCs from other non-green plant tissues (6Schuller K.A. Turpin D.H. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1429-1435Google Scholar, 8Moraes T.F. Plaxton W.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4465-4476Google Scholar,9Law R.D. Plaxton W.C. Biochem.

Planta. 1999; 208: 66-72Google Scholar), COS PEPC1 was activated by hexose-mono-Ps and potently inhibited by malate, Asp, and Glu at pH 7.3 (Table II). This result indicates that PEPC1 may fulfill a key anaplerotic role to replenish dicarboxylic acids consumed through transamination reactions required to support storage protein synthesis. The inhibition of PEPC1 by Asp and Glu provides a tight feedback control that could closely balance PEPC1 activity with the production of C-skeletons (i.e. oxaloacetate, 2-oxoglutarate) required for NH4+ assimilation or transamination reactions. The 舠effector-insensitive舡 PEPC2, by contrast, may facilitate PEP flux to malate in support of leucoplast fatty acid synthesis despite the significant malate levels present in developing COS (18Smith R.G. Gauthier D.A. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1233-1238Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE of clarified COS extracts followed by in-gel PEPC activity staining revealed that PEPC2 increases during COS development, peaking at stage VII, and then rapidly disappears during COS maturation (Fig.4C). This pattern parallels triglyceride accumulation in this tissue, which also peaks at stage VII (34Simcox P.D. Garland W. DeLuca V. Canvin D.T. Dennis D.T. Can. J. Bot. 1979; 57: 1008-1014Google Scholar). The developmental profile for PEPC1 (Fig. 4C), by contrast, parallels that of storage protein accumulation (24Greenwood J. Bewley J. Can. J. Bot. 1982; 60: 1751-1760Google Scholar), with both becoming maximal during the maturation phase of COS development. Further studies using transgenic plants and/or pharmacological inhibitors will help to fully evaluate the metabolic functions of COS PEPC1 and PEPC2.It remains to be determined whether and how COS PEPC1 and PEPC2 interconvert. However, protein-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of p102 appears to be involved in the control and structural organization of green algal (S. minutum) Class 2 PEPCs (23Rivoal J. Turpin D.H. Plaxton W.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 785-792Google Scholar). COS p107 contains the N-terminal regulatory seryl phosphorylation site characteristic of most plant PEPCs (Fig. 3A). It will be of interest to determine whether COS PEPC1 and PEPC2 are interconverted via a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism involving p107 and/or p64. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)1 is a ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme in vascular plants that is also widely distributed in green algae and bacteria (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar). It catalyzes the irreversible ॆ-carboxylation of PEP in the presence of Mg2+ and HCO3− to yield oxaloacetate and Pi. PEPC is abundant in C4 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) leaves where it participates in photosynthesis by catalyzing the initial fixation of atmospheric CO2. Both allosteric mechanisms and covalent modification are involved in PEPC control in C4 and CAM leaves (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar, 2Rajagopalan A., V Devi M.T. Raghavendra A.S. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 115-135Google Scholar, 3Nimmo H.G. Batey N.H. Dickinson H.G. Hetherington S.M. Society for Experimental Biology Seminar Series 53: Post Translational Modifications in Plants. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1993: 161-170Google Scholar). Early work established that C4 and CAM PEPCs are controlled by a diurnal cycle that modulates their sensitivity to l-malate inhibition (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar, 2Rajagopalan A., V Devi M.T. Raghavendra A.S. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 39: 115-135Google Scholar, 3Nimmo H.G. Batey N.H. Dickinson H.G. Hetherington S.M. Society for Experimental Biology Seminar Series 53: Post Translational Modifications in Plants. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1993: 161-170Google Scholar). This cycle is the result of phosphorylation of the PEPC homotetramer by an endogenous Ca2+-independent PEPC protein kinase and dephosphorylation by a protein phosphatase type 2A at a highly conserved seryl residue localized near the N terminus of the 100–110-kDa PEPC subunit (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar, 2Rajagopalan A., V Devi M.T. Raghavendra A.S. Photosynth.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1993: 161-170Google Scholar). Relative to C4 and CAM PEPCs, the properties of the enzyme from non-green plant tissues are less well understood. Although proposed roles for nonphotosynthetic PEPCs are diverse, a crucial PEPC function is the anaplerotic replenishment of citric acid cycle intermediates consumed during biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation (1Chollet R. Vidal J. O' Leary M.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 273-298Google Scholar). As with C4 and CAM PEPCs, the PEPC of C3leaves and nonphotosynthetic tissues can be controlled by allosteric effectors and reversible phosphorylation (4Duff S.M.G. Chollet R. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 775-782Google Scholar, 5Munoz T. Escribano M.I. Merodio C. Phytochemistry. 2001; 58: 1007-1013Google Scholar, 6Schuller K.A. Turpin D.H. Plaxton W.C.

However, despite the probable central role of PEPCs in the metabolism of developing and germinating seeds (11Podestá F.E. Plaxton W.C. Planta. 1992; 194: 381-387Google Scholar, 12Hedley C.L.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Google Scholar), no seed PEPC has been fully purified and thoroughly characterized. Storage lipids account for as much as 657 of the weight of mature castor oilseeds (COS). Triacylglyceride accumulation depends on the synthesis of long chain fatty acids, which in developing oilseeds occurs in specialized plastids termed leucoplasts. This process requires the transport of both sucrose-derived carbon skeletons and energetic intermediates across the plastid envelope (17Rawsthorne S. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 41: 182-196Google Scholar).l-Malate supports significant rates of fatty acid synthesis by isolated leucoplasts from developing COS (18Smith R.G. Gauthier D.A. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1233-1238Google Scholar). Malate imported from the cytosol into the leucoplast stroma is mediated by a malate/Pi translocator within the COS leucoplast envelope (19Eastmond P.J. Dennis D.T. Rawsthorne S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 851-856Google Scholar). Sangwan and co-workers (16Sangwan R.S. Singh N. Plaxton W.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 445-449Google Scholar) hypothesized that the large increase in PEPC activity and concentration that accompanies COS development facilitates malate production for fatty acid synthesis. The increased PEP to malate flux would also serve as an anaplerotic source of C-skeletons for transamination reactions associated with COS storage protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to purify and characterize PEPC from developing COS. Here we present unexpected evidence for two PEPC isoforms from developing COS and examine their structural and kinetic properties. Although one isoform is a typical PEPC homotetramer, the other represents a unique high Mr PEPC complex unprecedented in vascular plants but remarkably reminiscent of Class 2 PEPC isoforms recently described in unicellular green algae (20Rivoal J. Dunford R. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 332: 47-57Google Scholar, 21Rivoal J. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 201-209Google Scholar, 22Rivoal J. Trzos S.

MALDI-TOF MS and microsequencing revealed that like the p64 of COS PEPC2, the 130- kDa subunit (p130) of S. minutum Class 2 PEPC represents a distinct PEPC-like polypeptide that is only distantly related to p102 (22Rivoal J. Trzos S. Gage D.A. Plaxton W.C. Turpin D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12588-12597Google Scholar). Moreover, relative to COS PEPC1 and algal Class 1 PEPCs, the COS PEPC2 and algal Class 2 PEPCs demonstrate significantly enhanced thermal stability and a much lower sensitivity to allosteric effectors and pH changes within the physiological range (20Rivoal J.

Taken together, the data imply that high and low MrPEPC isoforms arose in green algae before the evolution of vascular plants, with this feature being conserved as a key structure-function aspect of at least some plant PEPCs.Possible Functions and Interconversion of COS PEPC1 and PEPC2Similar to PEPCs from other non-green plant tissues (6Schuller K.A.

Planta. 1999; 208: 66-72Google Scholar), COS PEPC1 was activated by hexose-mono-Ps and potently inhibited by malate, Asp, and Glu at pH 7.3 (Table II). This result indicates that PEPC1 may fulfill a key anaplerotic role to replenish dicarboxylic acids consumed through transamination reactions required to support storage protein synthesis. The inhibition of PEPC1 by Asp and Glu provides a tight feedback control that could closely balance PEPC1 activity with the production of C-skeletons (i.e. oxaloacetate, 2-oxoglutarate) required for NH4+ assimilation or transamination reactions. The 舠effector-insensitive舡 PEPC2, by contrast, may facilitate PEP flux to malate in support of leucoplast fatty acid synthesis despite the significant malate levels present in developing COS (18Smith R.G. Gauthier D.A. Dennis D.T. Turpin D.H. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1233-1238Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE of clarified COS extracts followed by in-gel PEPC activity staining revealed that PEPC2 increases during COS development, peaking at stage VII, and then rapidly disappears during COS maturation (Fig.4C). This pattern parallels triglyceride accumulation in this tissue, which also peaks at stage VII (34Simcox P.D. Garland W. DeLuca V. Canvin D.T. Dennis D.T. Can. J. Bot. 1979; 57: 1008-1014Google Scholar). The developmental profile for PEPC1 (Fig. 4C), by contrast, parallels that of storage protein accumulation (24Greenwood J. Bewley J. Can. J. Bot. 1982; 60: 1751-1760Google Scholar), with both becoming maximal during the maturation phase of COS development. Further studies using transgenic plants and/or pharmacological inhibitors will help to fully evaluate the metabolic functions of COS PEPC1 and PEPC2.It remains to be determined whether and how COS PEPC1 and PEPC2 interconvert. However, protein-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of p102 appears to be involved in the control and structural organization of green algal (S. minutum) Class 2 PEPCs (23Rivoal J. Turpin D.H.

In this paper we report combinations of mutations in the major MMP-binding region that enhance the specificity of N-TIMP-1. Mutants with substitutions for residues 4 and 68 were characterized and combined with previously studied Thr2 mutations to generate mutants with improved selectivity or binding affinity to specific MMPs. Some combinations of mutations had non-additive effects on ΔG of binding to MMPs, suggesting interactions between subsites in the reactive site. The T2L/V4S mutation generates an inhibitor that binds to MMP-2 20-fold more tightly than to MMP-3(ΔC) and over 400-fold more tightly than to MMP-1. The T2S/V4A/S68Y mutant is the strongest inhibitor for stromelysin-1 among all mutants characterized to date, with an apparentK i for MMP-3(ΔC) in the picomolar range. A third mutant, T2R/V4I, has no detectable inhibitory activity for MMP-1 but is an effective inhibitor of MMP-2 and -3. These selective TIMP variants may provide useful tools for investigation of biological roles of specific MMPs and for possible therapy of MMP-related diseases.

Activity and zymogen activation in MMPs are regulated by a group of endogenous proteins named the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Google Scholar). TIMPs are distributed in both invertebrates and vertebrates (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 64-70Google Scholar). The mammalian TIMPs are a family of four members (TIMP-1–4) that have about 40% sequence identity and fold into two domains, each containing three disulfide bonds (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Google Scholar).

O'Shea M. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Google Scholar). Although there are four TIMPs, their inhibitory activities toward different MMPs are not particularly specific. A notable exception is that TIMP-1 is a weak inhibitor of MT-MMPs, whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are much more effective (15Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol.

These structures show that the N-terminal inhibitory domain consists of a 5-stranded β-barrel with three associated α-helices resembling the folds of members of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) protein family (23Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The structure of the TIMP-1/MMP-3 complex reveals that about 75% of all intermolecular contacts are made by residues adjacent to the disulfide bond between Cys1 and Cys70, especially residues 1–5 and 66–70. These two sections of chain insert into the active site cleft of the MMP, thus blocking its accessibility to substrates (18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar). The N-terminal Cys1 coordinates the catalytic Zn2+ through the α-amino group and the peptide carbonyl group and is crucial for the inhibitory activity of TIMPs for MMPs, as shown by the complete loss of inhibitory activity for MMPs in TIMP-2 on carbamylation of the α-amino group of the NH2-terminal Cys1 (24Higashi S. Miyazaki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10497-10504Google Scholar) or mutation to append an alanine extension to the amino terminus (25Wingfield P.T. Sax J.K. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Palmer I. Chung V.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar, 27Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Google Scholar), together with work with N-TIMP-2 by others (28Butler G.S. Hutton M. Wattam B.A. Williamson R.A. Knauper V. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20391-20396Google Scholar), suggest that the affinity and specificity of TIMP for MMPs can be modified by site-directed mutagenesis. A major determinant of the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for different MMPs is the residue at position 2 in the sequence (threonine 2 in the wild-type protein) which interacts with the S1′ pocket of MMPs, a key to MMP substrate specificity (27Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Google Scholar). Based on this, it is reasonable to hypothesize that other residues that make contact with MMPs also contribute to the binding affinity and specificity of N-TIMP-1 and that selective variants can be generated by combining suitable mutations at these sites. In the present study, we show that N-TIMP-1 mutants with substitutions at positions 4 and 68 showed changes in affinity and specificity for MMPs. Combinations of mutations in these positions with those in position 2 led to the discovery of N-TIMP-1 variants with higher binding affinity and specificity for individual MMPs. Vectors and cell lines used for expression of N-TIMP-1 and variants were from the same sources as in previous studies (26Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar, 27Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Google Scholar, 29Huang W.

Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were obtained from New England BioLabs. PCR reactions were performed in a PCR Sprint HYBAID system from Midwest Scientific. C-terminally truncated MMP-3 (MMP-3(ΔC)) and active forms of MMP-1 and MMP-2 were generated as described previously (29Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Google Scholar). The Biologic DuoFlow medium-pressure chromatography system was purchased from BioRad, and the cation exchange Mono S HR 5/5 HPLC column was from Amersham Biosciences. Synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates Knight ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-N-(3-{2,4-dinitrophenyl}-l-2,3-diaminopropyl)-Ala-Arg-NH2) and NFF-3 ((7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Arg-Pro-Val-Glu-norvalinyl-Trp-Arg-Lys-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-NH2) were from Bachem. DNA sequencing was carried out in the laboratory of Dr. R. Werner, Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami School of Medicine. Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. Plasmid pET-3a containing the N-Timp-1 gene was used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis by PCR. Val4 mutations and double mutations at positions 2 and 4 were introduced by direct PCR with a forward primer containing the mutations and a T7 terminator primer as reverse primer. The primers used (mutated codons are underlined) are as follows: 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTGCCCCACCCCAC-3′ for V4A; 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTATCCCACCCCAC-3′ for V4I; 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTAAACCACCCCAC-3′ for V4K; 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCACCTGTTCCCCACCCCAC-3′ for V4S; 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCCTCTGTTCCCCACCCCAC-3′ for T2L/V4S; 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCTCCTGTGCCCCACCCCAC-3′ for T2S/V4A; and 5′-GGAGATATACATATGTGCCGCTGTATCCCACCCCAC-3′ for T2R/V4I. Ser68 mutations and triple mutations were introduced by mega-primer PCR as described previously (26Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar, 27Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Google Scholar) using a T7 promoter primer (for Ser68 single mutation) or primers introducing the corresponding double mutations at positions 2 and 4 (for triple mutations) as the forward primer, a reverse primer that introduces the corresponding mutation at position 68, and a T7 terminator primer as the other reverse primer. The following primers were used for mutagenesis (the mutated anti-codons are underlined): 5′-GAAGTATCCGCAGACAGCCTCCATGGCGGGGGT-3′ for S68A; 5′-GAAGTATCCGCAGACCTCCTCCATGGCGGGGGT-3′ for S68E; 5′-GAAGTATCCGCAGACACGCTCCATGGCGGGGGT-3′ for S68R; and 5′-GAAGTATCCGCAGACATACTCCATGGCGGGGGT-3′ for S68Y. PCR products were cloned into pET-3a vector using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 promoter primer. The N-Timp-1 mutants were expressed in Escherichia. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies and folded in vitro as described previously (29Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S.R. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Google Scholar). N-TIMP-1 and mutant proteins purified by cation exchange chromatography with CM-52 were dialyzed overnight against 15 volumes of 20 mmbis-Tris-HCl, pH 5.5 (pH 6.0 for T2R/V4I) and applied to a cation exchange Mono S HR 5/5 column previously equilibrated with the same buffer and connected to a Biologic DuoFlow medium pressure chromatography system. The protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–0.5 M NaCl over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The activity of different fractions was estimated by the fluorescence assay method using MMP-3(ΔC) and NFF-3 substrate as described (26Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar). Two similarly sized peaks, which slightly overlap, were obtained in this separation, and fractions corresponding to the second peak, which contained the MMP-3 inhibitory activity, were pooled and titrated with MMP-3(ΔC). Various concentrations of the inhibitors were incubated with MMP-3(ΔC) (300 nm) for 4 h at 37 °C, diluted 300-fold with TNC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 and 0.02% Brij 35) and immediately assayed with 1.5 μm NFF-3 substrate as described (26Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar). These results showed that this protein is >85% active for MMP inhibition. K i(app) of N-TIMP-1 and mutants against MMP-1, -2, and -3(ΔC) were determined using fluorescence assay as described previously (26Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The incubation time for the inhibitors with MMP-1 and MMP-3(ΔC) was 2 and 4 h, respectively. To calculateK i(app), the following formulas were used (30Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Google Scholar) as seen in Equations 1 and 2, It1−viv0=Et+Ki(app)v0viEquation 1 Ki(app)=KiAt+KmKmEquation 2 where I t is the total inhibitor concentration, E t is the total enzyme concentration,A t is the total substrate concentration, andK m is the Michaelis constant. In our assays the value of E t/K i(app)does not exceed 100 so that the inhibitor is distributed in both free and bound forms, and K i(app) can be calculated by fitting inhibition data to Equation 1 (30Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Google Scholar). Because the inactive portion of the N-TIMP-1 does not interfere with the binding of the active inhibitor with MMPs, as shown by isothermal titration by isothermal titration, 2S. Arumugam, G. Gao, B. L. Patton, V. Semechenko, K. Brew, and S. R. Van Doren, submitted for publication. the true K i values can be determined by multiplying theK i, calculated as described above, by the fraction of active TIMP determined by titration. Because the substrate concentration is very low relative to the estimatedK m, the apparent K i values are essentially identical to the true K i values. In the crystal structure of the N-TIMP-1/MMP-3 complex, the side chain of Val4 interacts with the S3′ site of MMP-3, forming contacts at the edge of the interaction interface (Fig.1, and Ref. 18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar). Four mutants with substitutions at position 4 of N-TIMP-1 were constructed and expressed in E. coli. As compared with the Thr2 mutations, which generally have strong effects on MMP binding (27Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Google Scholar), these mutations produce more moderate changes (TableI). Mutations of Val4 into isoleucine, lysine, and serine cause significant increases in theK i(app) for MMP-1 while having only a small effect on the affinity for MMP-2.Table IKi(app) (nm) of N-TIMP-1 position 4 and 68 mutants against MMP-1 (5 nm), MMP-2, and MMP-3(ΔC) (1 nm each)MutantMMP-1MMP-2MMP-3(ΔC)Wild type0.4 ± 0.020.4 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.002V4A0.4 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.020.1 ± 0.02V4I6.4 ± 0.70.3 ± 0.010.2 ± 0.01V4K8.7 ± 1.21.1 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.3V4S2.1 ± 0.30.4 ± 0.041.7 ± 0.2S68A14 ± 1.25.2 ± 0.732 ± 0.7S68E16 ± 23.2 ± 0.0614 ± 3S68R48 ± 2318 ± 649 ± 8S68Y61 ± 112.7 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab Mutants V4K and V4S are more selective for MMP-2 than the wild-type N-TIMP-1 as a result of minor changes in affinity for MMP-2 and larger reductions in binding to MMP-1 and MMP-3. The V4S mutant has an unchanged K i for MMP-2 but 5-fold and 8-fold increased K i values for MMP-1 and -3, respectively. The other two mutants also have modified inhibition activities; V4A has an increased affinity for MMP-3(ΔC), whereas V4I results in a 15-fold reduced affinity for MMP-1 but unchanged activity with MMP-2 and MMP-3(ΔC). Residues 66–70 of the C-D loop also form part of the core of the TIMP/MMP contact site (Fig.1 and Ref. 18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that substitutions for Met66 or Val69 affect TIMP activity (26Huang W. Meng Q. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Google Scholar). Here we mutated the Ser68 to Ala, Glu, Arg, and Tyr. These mutations have large effects on MMP binding (Table I). Three of the four mutants have improved selectivity for MMP-2 relative to the other two MMPs, whereas the fourth mutant, S68Y, inhibits MMP-3 much more strongly than MMP-1 and -2. Based on the mutagenesis studies of Thr2, Val4, and Ser68, we constructed double and triple mutants containing combinations of the more selective single-site mutations. Characterization of these mutants shows that effects of the individual mutations are generally additive but with some exceptions (Table II), suggesting that these residues do not always contribute independently to the stability of the TIMP/MMP complex.Table IIKi(app) (nm) of N-TIMP-1 combined mutants against MMP-1 (5 nm), MMP-2, and MMP-3 (1 nm each)MutantMMP-1MMP-2MMP-3(ΔC)Wild type0.4 ± 0.020.4 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.002T2L37 ± 60.4 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.2V4S2.1 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.041.7 ± 0.2T2L/V4S140 ± 60.3 ± 0.016.0 ± 0.6(194)2-aValues in parentheses (/) are calculated by assuming that the free energy changes from single mutations have additive effects in a multi-site mutant.(0.4)(11)S68A14 ± 15.2 ± 0.732 ± 0.7T2L/V4S/S68A∼30004.0 ± 0.214 ± 0.4(6800)(5)(1760)T2S5.9 ± 0.80.8 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.04V4A0.4 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.020.1 ± 0.02T2S/V4A3.3 ± 0.60.4 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.006(5.9)(1.0)(0.05)S68Y61 ± 112.7 ± 0.30.3 ± 0.02T2S/V4A/S68Y15 ± 0.60.1 ± 0.0060.05 ± 0.004(899)(6.8)(0.04)T2R∼20004.8 ± 0.211 ± 0.8V4I6.4 ± 0.70.3 ± 0.0080.2 ± 0.01T2R/V4INID2-bNID, no inhibition detected up to 10 μm N-TIMP mutant.10 ± 0.64.0 ± 0.1(32000)(3.6)(5.5)Data of the Thr2 mutants were taken from our previous study (30Henderson P.J.F.

Open table in a new tab Data of the Thr2 mutants were taken from our previous study (30Henderson P.J.F. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 321-333Google Scholar). The T2L mutation was combined with V4S to generate a N-TIMP-1 variant that is more selective for MMP-2. As predicted, with MMP-2 the resulting double mutant inhibits 20-fold more strongly than with MMP-3(ΔC) and about 470-fold more strongly than with MMP-1. Introduction of a third mutation, S68A, produced a mutant binding very weakly to MMP-1 while retaining a good activity for MMP-2. However, this inhibitor is much more effective with MMP-3 than is predicted based on additive effects on the free energy of binding (Table II). This triple mutant, T2L/V4S/S68A, is less selective against MMP-3(ΔC) than the double mutant T2L/V4S. The double mutant, T2S/V4A, has an increased inhibitory activity for MMP-3. Binding with MMP-2 is unchanged, whereas that with MMP-1 is weaker than the wild-type protein. Interestingly, the triple mutant T2S/V4A/S68Y has the highest inhibitory activity for MMP-3(ΔC) among all mutants characterized so far, with a K i of 50 pm. Unexpectedly, it also has a greatly improved affinity for MMP-2, whereas binding to MMP-1 was reduced over 36-fold. The T2R/V4I mutant was purified as a ∼95% active form using a Mono S column at pH 6.0 instead of pH 5.5, which is used for the wild-type protein. We could not detect any inhibition of MMP-1 by this mutant even at a concentration of 10 μm, yet it retains good activity as an inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-3(ΔC). The TIMPs are important regulators of extracellular matrix metabolism (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Google Scholar), principally through their primary activities as endogenous inhibitors of MMPs. Imbalances between the levels of TIMPs and active MMPs are linked to disease processes such as tumor metastasis, arthritis, and atherosclerosis (31Bode W. Fernandez-Catalan C. Tschesche H. Grams F. Nagase H. Maskos K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 639-652Google Scholar, 32Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122Google Scholar). Low molecular weight MMP inhibitors have been developed and extensively studied, and a few have been used in clinical trials but with little success (33Overall C.M. Lopez-Otin C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 657-672Google Scholar). Nonspecific inhibition of housekeeping MMP functions has been proposed as the major drawback of these inhibitors (34McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 149-156Google Scholar). We proposed previously that N-TIMP-1 can be engineered to produce more selective MMP inhibitors that could be applied in gene therapy of MMP-related diseases (35Nagase H. Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Chung L. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 1-11Google Scholar, 36Nagase H. Brew K. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S51-S61Google Scholar), and residue 2 of TIMP-1 was found to be a major determinant of affinity and specificity for MMPs (27Meng Q. Malinovskii V. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Google Scholar). In this paper we report the effects of mutagenesis of two other residues that are important in TIMP/MMP binding; combinations of mutations in these positions with Thr2 mutations generate N-TIMP-1 variants with increased selectivity and/or affinity for specific MMPs. The side chain of Val4 occupies a site similar to the substrate P3′-subsite in currently known TIMP/MMP complexes (18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar, 19Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Google Scholar). In the complex of TIMP-1 with MMP-3, the side chain of Val4sits in a shallow groove at the margin of the interaction site close to the side chains of Gly161, Asn162, Leu164, and Tyr223 of the protease (15Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Google Scholar). These residues are >4 Å from Val4, and the insignificant effect of truncating the side chain through the Ala substitution on the affinity for all three MMPs suggests that interactions between the side chain of Val4 and the protease contributes little to the free energy of binding. The Val4 side chain projects away from the protease surface in the TIMP-1/MMP-3 complex (18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar), and the more extended Ile side chain can be accommodated in MMP-2 and -3 without perturbing the protein-protein interaction, but in MMP-1 it produces a 14-fold loss in affinity. The basis for this is uncertain, because the structures of complexes of TIMP-1 with MMP-1 and -2 have not been determined, but this result suggests that the S3′ site of MMP-1 does not readily accommodate a larger side chain; it is also affected more than the other proteases by the Lys substitution (TableI). Differences between the MMPs in the residues that form the P3′ site do not readily account for these effects; residues Leu164and Tyr223 of MMP-3 are conserved in MMP-1 and -2, whereas residues corresponding to Gly161-Asn162 are Gly-Gly in MMP-1 and Asp-Gly in MMP-2, so changes in side chain size are not responsible for the reduced steric tolerance in this subsite in MMP-1. The binding of TIMP-1 to MMP-2 is least affected by substitutions for Val4, suggesting that there is greater separation between MMP-2 and N-TIMP-1 in this part of the interaction site. The side chain of Ser68 of TIMP-1 interacts with the S2 subsite of MMP-3 in the crystal structure of their complex and is in contact with Ala167 of the metalloproteinase (18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar). It is also near (<4.5 Å distance) to His166, Tyr168, Ala169, and His205. Mutation of Ser68 to Ala, Glu, and Arg reduces the affinity of N-TIMP-1 for all three MMPs, but the effect is less for MMP-2 than for MMP-1 and MMP-3. The Tyr mutant has a major effect on inhibitor specificity, producing a 150-fold loss in affinity for MMP-1, a 7-fold reduction in affinity for MMP-2, but essentially no change in binding to MMP-3. The side chain of Ser68 of TIMP-1 projects toward Ala169 of MMP-3 in their complex (18Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Google Scholar), and it appears that the Tyr side chain can be accommodated without major perturbation of the interaction interface. Ala is conserved at this site in MMP-2, but in MMP-1 it is replaced by Gln. A steric conflict between the Gln side chain and Tyr68 in the N-TIMP-1 mutant is a possible explanation of the effects of this mutation on inhibitor selectivity. Substitutions for residues 2, 4, and 68 with similar selectivity were combined in an attempt to engineer N-TIMP-1 variants with higher selectivity and/or affinity for specific MMPs. In some cases, the effects of these mutations are essentially additive (Table II), indicating that interactions with the S1′, S3′, and S2 subsites of MMPs contribute independently to the stability of the TIMP/MMP complex. However, some mutants containing combinations of mutations have much lower K i values for particular MMPs than predicted based on the assumption that individual substitutions have additive effects on the ΔG of binding. For example, the T2L/V4S/S68A mutant has a >100-fold higher affinity for MMP-3(ΔC) than expected, yet itsK i values for MMP-1 and MMP-2 are in good agreement with predictions. Similarly, the T2S/V4A/S68Y is a 60-fold better inhibitor of MMP-1 and also a 68-fold better inhibitor of MMP-2 than predicted based on additivity. These discrepancies greatly exceed the compounded errors of the single-site mutations and suggest interactive effects between the sites in these triple mutants. Because of the complexity of protein-protein interactions, there are many possible explanations for this, such as changes in relative orientation of TIMP and protease, structural changes introduced by the mutations, and changes in dynamics (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Google Scholar). Structural studies are in progress to address this question. Several combined mutants have interesting and potentially useful properties. T2L/V4S is selective for MMP-2, providing a possible tool for gene therapy of gelatinase-related diseases. Another mutant, T2S/V4A/S69Y, is the best inhibitor for stromelysin-1 among all mutants discovered so far, although it also exhibits excellent inhibitory activity for MMP-2. The apparent K i of this inhibitor for MMP-3(ΔC) is 50 pm, providing the most potent inhibitor of stromelysin-1 among all N-TIMP-1 mutants. The third mutant, T2R/V4I, has no detectable activity for MMP-1 while retaining good inhibition for MMP-2 and -3. This mutant is of special interest, because the failure of many general MMP inhibitors in clinical trials was the result of muscular-skeletal disorders that are thought to be caused by nonspecific inhibition of MMP-1 (38Natchus M.G. Bookland R.G. De B. Almstead N.G. Pikul S. Janusz M.J. Heitmeyer S.A. Hookfin E.B. Hsieh L.C. Dowty M.E. Dietsch C.R. Patel V.S. Garver S.M. Gu F. Pokross M.E. Mieling G.E. Baker T.R. Foltz D.J. Peng S.X. Bornes D.M. Strojnowski M.J. Taiwo Y.O. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4948-4963Google Scholar). Our mutational studies have demonstrated the feasibility of generating selective MMP inhibitors by engineering TIMP. Using high throughput screening methods, it should be possible to identify TIMP variants that are specific inhibitors of individual MMPs for application in future clinical trials."

In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the extent of tyrosine nitration depends on the intramembrane location of tyrosyl probes and on the nitrating species. To this end, we have synthesized membrane spanning 23-mer containing a single tyrosyl residue at positions 4, 8, and 12. The location of the tyrosine residues in the phospholipid membrane was determined by fluorescence and electron spin resonance techniques. Nitration was initiated by slow infusion of peroxynitrite, co-generated superoxide and nitric oxide (⋅NO), or a myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/nitrite anion (MPO/H2O2/NO 2−) system. Results indicate that with slow infusion of peroxynitrite, nitration of transmembrane tyrosyl peptides was much higher (10-fold or more) than tyrosine nitration in aqueous phase. Peroxynitrite-dependent nitration of tyrosyl-containing peptides increased with increasing depth of the tyrosyl residue in the bilayer. In contrast, MPO/H2O2/ NO 2−-induced tyrosyl nitration decreased with increasing depth of tyrosyl residues in the membrane. Transmembrane nitrations of tyrosyl-containing peptides induced by both peroxynitrite and MPO/H2O2/NO 2− were totally inhibited by ⋅NO that was slowly released from spermine NONOate. Nitration of peptides in both systems was concentration-dependently inhibited by unsaturated fatty acid. Concomitantly, an increase in lipid oxidation was detected. A mechanism involving ⋅NO2 radical is proposed for peroxynitrite and MPO/H2O2/NO 2−-dependent transmembrane nitration reactions.

Thus, in vitro mechanistic studies using “free” tyrosine in the aqueous phase may not adequately reflect the mechanisms of nitration of protein tyrosyl residues in vivo (8Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J.

In addition, the efficiency of nitration of tyrosine induced by peroxynitrite in the aqueous phase has been reported to be remarkably low (1–4%) (11Souza J.M. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. Raman C.S.

In contrast, nitrations of membrane-incorporated γ-tocopherol (a membrane-associated chromanol) and N-t-BOCl-tyrosine tert-butyl ester were increased by 3- to 5-fold (12Goss S.P.A. Hogg N.

A plausible reason for the increased efficiency of lipid-phase nitration is the greater membrane permeability of reactive nitrogen species coupled with decreased lateral diffusion of membrane-bound tyrosyl free radical, making radical-radical dimerization unlikely (15Zhang H. Joseph J. Feix J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7675-7686Google Scholar).These previous studies demonstrated preferential nitration of γ-tocopherol and tyrosyl analogs that are distributed throughout the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer (12Goss S.P.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 333-340Google Scholar, 15Zhang H. Joseph J. Feix J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7675-7686Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the extent of nitration of membrane-incorporated tyrosyl probe is dependent on its intramembrane location. To test this hypothesis, we have synthesized membrane spanning 23-mer peptides containing a single tyrosyl residue at positions 4, 8, and 12 and monitored their nitration reactions in the membrane bilayer.In this study, we have used HPLC, 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CAPHPLC, capillary HPLC; BTBE, N-BOC l-tyrosine tert-butyl ester; DLPC, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; ESR, electron spin resonance; PLPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; SA, stearic acid; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline)-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate; MPO, myeloperoxidase; MNP, 2-methyl-2 nitroso propane; NiEDDA, nickel (II) ethylenediaminediacetate; SNN, spermine NONOate; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; MDA, malondialdehyde; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DIC, diisopropylcarbodiimide; HOBt, 1-hydroxybezotriazole; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidinone 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CAPHPLC, capillary HPLC; BTBE, N-BOC l-tyrosine tert-butyl ester; DLPC, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; ESR, electron spin resonance; PLPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; SA, stearic acid; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline)-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate; MPO, myeloperoxidase; MNP, 2-methyl-2 nitroso propane; NiEDDA, nickel (II) ethylenediaminediacetate; SNN, spermine NONOate; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; MDA, malondialdehyde; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DIC, diisopropylcarbodiimide; HOBt, 1-hydroxybezotriazole; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidinone electron spin resonance (ESR), and fluorescence techniques for detection and characterization of transmembrane nitration reactions of tyrosyl probes induced by peroxynitrite and ⋅NO2.

The present findings point to an intermediacy of⋅NO2 in transmembrane nitration reactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe following chemicals and enzymes were purchased from various sources as indicated: tyrosine, hydrogen peroxide, sodium nitrite, sodium bicarbonate, 3-nitrotyrosine, and thiobarbituric acid (Sigma), tetranitromethane and tetramethoxypropane (Aldrich), 3-morpholinosydnonimine HCl (SIN-1; Calbiochem), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (PLPC) (Avanti Polar Lipids), and myeloperoxidase (Calbiochem). Rink amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin and all Fmoc-protected amino acids were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 1-hydroxybezotriazole (HOBt), triisopropylsilane, piperidine, and N-methylpyrrolidione (NMP) were purchased from Fisher Scientific and used without further purification. Spin-labeled fatty acids (5-doxyl)-stearic acid and (12-doxyl)-stearic acid are from Avanti Chemicals. Peroxynitrite was synthesized according to the published procedure (18Papée H.M. Petriconi G.L. Nature. 1964; 204: 142-144Google Scholar, 19Darley-Usmar V.M. Hogg N. O'Leary V.J. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 9-20Google Scholar), and its concentration in 0.01 m NaOH was determined using the extinction coefficient (ε = 1,670 m−1cm−1 at 302 nm). All reagents were prepared in double-distilled deionized water.Peptide Synthesis and PurificationSequences of the peptides used in this study are given in Table I. The peptides were acetylated and amidated to stabilize their α-helical secondary structure. The peptides were chemically synthesized using standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis chemistry on an Advanced Chemtech Model 90 synthesizer (Louisville, KY). Rink amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin (loading 0.72 mmol/g) was used as a solid support. Fmoc-protected amino acids were coupled as HOBt esters. All amino acids were double coupled using HOBt/DIC. The following steps were performed in the reaction vessel for each double coupling: deprotection of the Fmoc group with 20% piperidine in NMP for 30 min (2 times), three NMP washes, two dichloromethane washes, first coupling for 1 h with 5-fold excess of Fmoc amino acid in 0.5 m HOBt and 0.5 m DIC, second coupling using a fresh addition of the same reagent for another hour, three NMP washes, and two dichloromethane washes. Final acetylation was performed using acetic anhydride/HOBt/DIC for 30 min (twice). The resin was washed twice with dichloromethane and three times with methanol and then dried under vacuum prior to cleavage. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin with 90% trifluoroacetic acid containing triisopropylsilane for 3 h at room temperature. The resin was removed by filtration and washed with trifluoroacetic acid, and the combined trifluoroacetic acid filtrates were evaporated to dryness under a steam of dry N2 gas. The oily residue was washed three times with cold ether to remove scavengers, and the dry crude peptide was dissolved in acetonitrile/H2O (1:1) and lyophilized. The crude peptides were purified by semi-preparative reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac RP-C8 (10 × 250 mm) column (Hesperia, CA) using a CH3CN/water gradient (20 to 100% CH3CN over 50 min) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 3 ml/min with detection at 220 nm. Elution of the peptides generally occurred between 50 and 70% CH3CN. Purity and homogeneity of the peptides were cross-checked by analytical reverse-phase HPLC, and the purified peptides (∼95% pure) were characterized by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer.Table ICharacteristics of transmembrane peptidesPeptideSequenceMolecular weightY-4Ac-NH-KKAYALALALALALALALALAKK-CONH22350Y-8Ac-NH-KKALALAYALALALALALALAKK-CONH22350Y-12Ac-NH-KKALALALALAYALALALALAKK-CONH22350C-4Ac-NH-KKACALALALALALALALALAKK-CONH22290C-8Ac-NH-KKALALACALALALALALALAKK-CONH22290C-12Ac-NH-KKALALALALACALALALALAKK-CONH22290 Open table in a new tab Synthesis of Nitro Peptides10 mg/ml peptide dissolved in MeOH/1% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed with NO2BF4 (5 mg/ml). After 20 min, the product was purified by a semi-preparative HPLC (C-18; 250 × 10 mm), pre-equilibrated with 50% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The nitro peptide was eluted by a linear CH3CN gradient (0.025%/min). Collected nitro peptide peak was dried under a stream of nitrogen and redissolved in MeOH as standard for analysis. Nitro peptides show a characteristic UV-visible spectrum. After adding NaOH, the 350-nm absorption peak in MeOH was pH-sensitive-shifted to 430 nm with an extinction coefficient of 4100m−1 cm−1.Spin Labeling Depth MeasurementsHPLC-purified peptides in methanol were mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline)-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSL) (Toronto Research Chemicals) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Unreacted spin labeled and unlabeled peptides were removed by semi-preparative HPLC as described above, and the MTSL-labeled peptides were collected and lyophilized. To prepared liposomes, spin-labeled peptides were dissolved in methanol and added to a thin film of DLPC to give a lipid:peptide molar ratio of 200:1. The samples were dried under a stream of N2 and placed under vacuum for at least 1 h. The dried lipid:peptide films were then hydrated at room temperature in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with or without 200 mm nickel (II) ethylenediaminediacetate (NiEDDA). ESR spectra were obtained on a Varian E-9 spectrometer equipped with a loop-gap resonator using a field modulation amplitude of 1.0 G. Samples were contained in a TPX capillary to facilitate equilibration with either air or high purity N2.Incorporation of Peptides into DLPC LiposomeLiposomes were prepared according to a previous report (15Zhang H. Joseph J. Feix J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7675-7686Google Scholar). A methanolic solution of peptide was added to DLPC dissolved in methanol. The mixture was then dried under a stream of N2 gas and kept in a vacuum dessicator overnight. Multilamellar liposomes were formed by thoroughly mixing the dried lipid in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (100 μm). Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by five cycles of freeze-thawing using liquid nitrogen followed by five cycles of extrusion through a 0.2-μm polycarbonate filter (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) in an extrusion apparatus (Lipex Biomembranes, Inc., Vancouver, BC). The nitration of peptides in liposomes prepared by both methods showed no significant difference.Nitration of Tyrosyl Peptides in LiposomesA typical reaction was initiated by adding 1 μl of various concentration of peroxynitrite diluted in 0.05 m NaOH into 29 μl of liposome (30 mm DLPC)-containing peptide (0.3 mm peptide). Incubation mixtures were in 0.1 mphosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA. After 20 min at room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with 600 μl of distilled water and centrifuged at 12800 rpm for 120 min, and the pelleted liposome was dried by a speedvac. The dried liposome was dissolved in MeOH containing 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid for HPLC analysis. Compared with liposomes dried directly, the recovery of peptide was greater than 95%. Neither decomposed peroxynitrite nor addition of NO 2−/NO 3− (200 μm) gave any detectable nitration products.Peroxynitrite InfusionThe slow infusion of peroxynitrite was performed using an infusion/withdraw pump from Harvard Apparatus (model 966) under constant stirring of liposomes or aqueous solution containing tyrosine probes. Peroxynitrite (15 mm diluted in 0.25 m NaOH) was infused at a constant rate (0.82 ± 0.05 μl per 10 min) into 0.25 ml of liposomes (30 mm DLPC containing 300 μm peptide) until the final concentration of peroxynitrite was measured to be 50 μm. The infusion rates for peroxynitrite were 5.0 μm/min. The maximum pH shift was less than 0.1 units after infusion. Peroxynitrite decomposition under these conditions was evaluated by following the absorption change at 302 nm and its nitration efficiency before and after infusion. After 45 min, the changes of optical absorption and nitration efficiency after infusion were less than 5% of the starting peroxynitrite stock solution.Myeloperoxidase/H2O2 /NO 2−SystemPeptides (0.3 mm) in 30 mm DLPC liposomes were incubated with 0.5 mm NaNO2, 0.1 or 0.2 mm H2O2, and 50 nm MPO in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were extracted and analyzed by HPLC as described below.HPLC Analysis of Nitration ProductsTypically, 2 μl of sample was injected into a capHPLC system (HP1100) with a cap C-18 column (150 × 2 mm) equilibrated with 50% CH3CN in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide and its nitration product were separated by a linear increase of CH3CN concentration (0.1%/min) at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. The elution was monitored by a variable UV detector at 280 and 350 nm. Peptide and nitrated peptide were eluted at 12 or 17.5 min, respectively.Nitration of tyrosine in aqueous solution was performed under the same conditions, and the product analysis of tyrosine reaction in aqueous solution was according to previous reports (12Goss S.P.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 333-340Google Scholar, 19Darley-Usmar V.M. Hogg N. O'Leary V.J. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Free Radic. Res.

Briefly, 2 μl of sample was injected into a capHPLC system (HP1100) with a cap C-18 column (150 × 2 mm) equilibrated with 4% MeOH in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 3.0, and the tyrosine and nitrotyrosine were eluted at 5 and 12 min at a flow rate of 15 μl/min. The elution was monitored by a variable UV detector at 280 and 350 nm.Fluorescence Quenching MeasurementsFluorescence spectra of peptides incorporated into liposomes (0.3 mm peptide in 30 mm DLPC in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 100 μm DTPA) were monitored using an excitation wavelength of 278 nm (slit width, 5 nm) and monitoring emission from 300–350 nm (slit width, 10 nm). The fluorescence quenching experiments were performed as follows: methanolic solutions of spin labels, 12-doxyl SA, or 5-doxyl SA in glass vials were dried under a stream of nitrogen, and liposomes containing peptides (Y-4, Y-8, or Y-12) were pipetted into these vials and vortexed for 5 min, allowing incorporation of the doxyl SA into the liposomes.TBA-MDA AssayWe used a modified HPLC method to measure TBA-MDA adduct (24Ohlin H. Pavlidis A.K. Ohlin A.K. Am. J. Cardiol. 1998; 82: 1463-1467Google Scholar). A mixture of 25 μl of sample (or standard), 75 μl of 0.15 m H3PO4, 25 μl of 0.44 mm TBA, and 25 μl of distilled H2O was heated in boiling water for 1 h and then cooled down on ice. An aliquot of 50 μl was neutralized with 50 μl of methanol-sodium hydroxide solution and analyzed by HPLC. Reverse-phase isocratic separation was applied on a Kromasil C-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with a methanol/water mobile phase (70/30%) (v/v) at 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The TBA-MDA adduct eluting at 4.7 min was detected at 532 and 553 nm extinction and emission, respectively. The injected amount was 10 μl.ESR MeasurementsESR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker ER 200 D-SRC spectrometer operating at 9.8 GHz and a cavity equipped with a Bruker Aquax liquid sample cell. Typical spectrometer parameters were as follows: scan range, 100 G; field set, 3510 G; time constant, 0.64 ms; scan time, 20 s; modulation amplitude, 5.0 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver gain, 2 × 105; and microwave power, 20 mW. Reaction mixtures consisting of Y-4 (0.4 mm) and 20 mm2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane (MNP) spin trap incorporated into 40 mm DLPC liposome in a phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (0.1 mm) were rapidly mixed with 2 mm peroxynitrite. Samples were subsequently transferred to a 100-μl capillary tube for ESR measurements.Statistic AnalysisThe data are presented as average ± S.D.

Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 169-178Google Scholar, 12Goss S.P.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 333-340Google Scholar, 13Ohshima H. Celan I. Chazotte L. Pignatelli B. Mower H.F. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 132-141Google Scholar). In contrast, nitrations of membrane-incorporated γ-tocopherol (a membrane-associated chromanol) and N-t-BOCl-tyrosine tert-butyl ester were increased by 3- to 5-fold (12Goss S.P.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 333-340Google Scholar, 14Jiang Q. Elson-Schwab I. Courtemanche C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A plausible reason for the increased efficiency of lipid-phase nitration is the greater membrane permeability of reactive nitrogen species coupled with decreased lateral diffusion of membrane-bound tyrosyl free radical, making radical-radical dimerization unlikely (15Zhang H. Joseph J. Feix J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7675-7686Google Scholar). These previous studies demonstrated preferential nitration of γ-tocopherol and tyrosyl analogs that are distributed throughout the hydrophobic phase of the bilayer (12Goss S.P.A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 333-340Google Scholar, 15Zhang H. Joseph J. Feix J. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7675-7686Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the extent of nitration of membrane-incorporated tyrosyl probe is dependent on its intramembrane location. To test this hypothesis, we have synthesized membrane spanning 23-mer peptides containing a single tyrosyl residue at positions 4, 8, and 12 and monitored their nitration reactions in the membrane bilayer. In this study, we have used HPLC, 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CAPHPLC, capillary HPLC; BTBE, N-BOC l-tyrosine tert-butyl ester; DLPC, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; ESR, electron spin resonance; PLPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; SA, stearic acid; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline)-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate; MPO, myeloperoxidase; MNP, 2-methyl-2 nitroso propane; NiEDDA, nickel (II) ethylenediaminediacetate; SNN, spermine NONOate; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; MDA, malondialdehyde; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DIC, diisopropylcarbodiimide; HOBt, 1-hydroxybezotriazole; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidinone 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CAPHPLC, capillary HPLC; BTBE, N-BOC l-tyrosine tert-butyl ester; DLPC, 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine; ESR, electron spin resonance; PLPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; SA, stearic acid; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline)-3-methylmethanethiosulfonate; MPO, myeloperoxidase; MNP, 2-methyl-2 nitroso propane; NiEDDA, nickel (II) ethylenediaminediacetate; SNN, spermine NONOate; TBA, thiobarbituric acid; MDA, malondialdehyde; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; DIC, diisopropylcarbodiimide; HOBt, 1-hydroxybezotriazole; NMP, N-methylpyrrolidinone electron spin resonance (ESR), and fluorescence techniques for detection and characterization of transmembrane nitration reactions of tyrosyl probes induced by peroxynitrite and ⋅NO2.

https://openalex.org/W2112401119,"Adenine-dependent hairpin ribozymes were isolated by in vitro selection from a degenerated hairpin ribozyme population. Two new adenine-dependent ribozymes catalyze their own reversible cleavage in the presence of free adenine. Both aptamers have Mg2+ requirements for adenine-assisted cleavage similar to the wild-type hairpin ribozyme. Cleavage kinetics studies in the presence of various other small molecules were compared. The data suggest that adenine does not induce RNA self-cleavage in the same manner for both aptamers. In addition, investigations of pH effects on catalytic rates show that both adenine-dependent aptamers are more active in basic conditions, suggesting that they use new acid/base catalytic strategies in which adenine could be involved directly. The discovery of hairpin ribozymes dependent on adenine for their reversible self-cleavage presents considerable biochemical and evolutionary interests because we show that RNA is able to use exogenous reactive molecules to enhance its own catalytic activity. Such a mechanism may have been a means by which the ribozymes of the RNA world enlarged their chemical repertoire.

Such a mechanism may have been a means by which the ribozymes of the RNA world enlarged their chemical repertoire. The RNA world theory assumes that modern life arose from molecular ancestors in which RNA molecules both stored genetic information and catalyzed chemical reactions (1Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1546-1552Google Scholar, 2Crick F.H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 38: 367-379Google Scholar, 3Orgel L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 38: 381-393Google Scholar, 4Gilbert W. Nature. 1986; 319: 618Google Scholar). According to this scenario, ribozymes of the RNA world would have been able to self-replicate (5Paul N. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12733-12740Google Scholar) and to control complex metabolisms with an expanded chemical repertoire (6Benner S.A. Ellington A.D. Tauer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7054-7058Google Scholar, 7Joyce G.F. Nature. 2002; 418: 214-221Google Scholar). Until recently, RNA catalysis was believed to be restricted to phosphate chemistry, but in vitro selection experiments and recent discoveries concerning natural ribozymes have demonstrated that the catalytic capacities of RNA are far more promising and exciting than previously anticipated (8Doudna J.A. Cech T.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 222-228Google Scholar, 9Bartel D.P. Unrau P.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 12: M9-M13Google Scholar, 10Nissen P. Hansen J. Ban N. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A.

However, in comparison with proteins, the chemical spectrum of ribozymes remains limited because of the limited chemical diversity of RNA, which is composed of only four different building blocks. Yet RNA could increase its range of functionalities by incorporating catalytic building blocks such as imidazole, thiol, and functional amino and carboxylate groups (14Maurel M.-C. J. Evol. Biol. 1992; 2: 173-188Google Scholar, 15Cedergren R. Grosjean H. BioSystems. 1987; 20: 259-266Google Scholar). Moreover, primeval nucleotides were not necessarily restricted to standard nucleotides; modified nucleotides may have played a role in catalysis in the RNA world (16White H.B. J. Mol. Evol. 1976; 7: 493-496Google Scholar,17Trémolières A. Biochimie (Paris). 1980; 62: 493-496Google Scholar). Another way for RNA to increase its chemical diversity would consist in the binding of exogenous molecules carrying reactive groups and handling them as catalytic cofactors. We recently reported the isolation of new RNA aptamers able to bind adenine in a novel mode of purine recognition (18Meli M. Vergne J. Decout J.L. Maurel M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2104-2111Google Scholar). Adenine is a likely prebiotic analog of histidine. Its catalytic capabilities are equivalent to histidine because of the presence of a free imidazole moiety (19Maurel M.-C. Ninio J. Biochimie (Paris). 1987; 69: 551-553Google Scholar, 20Maurel M.-C. Convert O. Orig. Life Evol. Biosph. 1990; 20: 43-48Google Scholar, 21Maurel M.-C. Décout J.L. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 190-195Google Scholar). It was previously shown that when adenine is placed in a favorable microenvironment, its catalytic efficiency is strongly enhanced (22Décout J.L. Vergne J. Maurel M.-C. Macromol. Chem. Phys. 1995; 196: 2615-2624Google Scholar, 23Ricard J. Vergne J. Decout J.L. Maurel M.-C. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 43: 315-325Google Scholar, 24Maurel M.-C. Décout J.L. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 3141-3182Google Scholar). Such favorable microenvironments could result from adenine binding to RNA and thereby providing catalytic sites. In this perspective, it is significant that abasic hairpin and hammerhead ribozymes can be rescued by the addition of exogenous bases that restore activity (25Lebruska L.L. Kuzmine I.I. Fedor M.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 465-473Google Scholar, 26Peracchi A. Beigelman L. Usman N. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11522-11527Google Scholar) and that imidazole and cytosine can rescue a cytosine mutation in a self-cleaving hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (27Perrotta A. Shih I.-H. Been M.D. Science. 1999; 286: 123-126Google Scholar, 28Shih I.-H. Been M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 98: 1489-1494Google Scholar). Also significant is the sequence homology between loop B of the hairpin ribozyme and the XBA aptamer (29Kiga D. Futamura Y. Sakamoto K. Yokoyama S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1755-1760Google Scholar), which was selected on the basis of its capacity to bind xanthine and guanine. Hence, the hairpin ribozyme may constitute a good starting point for the search of new ribozymes that require catalytic organic cofactors. We thus designed a SELEX procedure (systematicevolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to select inactive hairpin variants capable of recovering activity by the addition of exogenous free adenine. The selection was started from hairpin ribozyme with randomized sequences located in regions previously reported to be required for catalysis. Using this approach, our aim was to maximize the opportunities of selecting new hairpin ribozymes in which adenine restores the activity by its direct involvement in catalysis. Here we report the discovery of two new hairpin ribozymes that require adenine as catalytic cofactor for their reversible self-cleavage. Single-stranded DNA template and primers were synthesized chemically (Genset). The sequence of primer P1 (promoter primer) is 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTACGCTGAAACAG-3′ (T7 promoter sequence in bold), and that of primer P2 (reverse primer) is 5′-CCTCCGAAACAGGACTGTCAGGG-GGTACCAG-3′. The 80-nucleotide-long template consists of the minus strand that allows the synthesis of a hairpin ribozyme randomized in 20 critical positions. Its entire sequence is 5′-CCTCCGAAACAGGACTGTCAGGGGGTACCAGNNNNNNNNNCACAACGTGNNNNNNNCTGGTTGACNNNNCTGTTTCAGCG-3′. The two primer binding regions are located in the 5′- and 3′-termini. The 20 randomized nucleotides are all located within loops A and B (Fig. 1). The mutations are expected to perturb the geometry of the active site and hence the activity of the ribozyme. The variants to be selected are those that are inactive but whose activity is rescued by free adenine. In contrast to loop B, which is entirely randomized, only the first four unpaired nucleotides of loop A are randomized, because the 3′-unpaired sequence of the loop A is located in the reverse primer binding region that must be kept constant. A 6-ml PCR (Invitrogen) reaction with 1 μm each primer (P1 and P2) and 0.1 μm template (about 3.4 × 1014 random molecules) amplified by 10 cycles was performed. The random double-stranded DNA pool was then ethanol-precipitated and submitted to in vitro transcription (6 ml) using T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas). The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mm each rNTP, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 μm randomized DNA and 24,000 units of T7 RNA polymerase. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was purified on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (PAGE), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in distilled water, yielding ∼10 nmol of randomized RNA. Each selection round consisted in the alternation of negative and positive selection steps followed by reamplification of the selected material. Negative selection steps were performed to eliminate molecules that can self-cleave in the absence of adenine. The RNA was incubated in cleavage buffer (40 mmHEPES, 6 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) without adenine and purified by 10% denaturing PAGE. Positive selection was performed by incubating uncleaved RNA in cleavage buffer supersaturated with adenine (20–30 mm). The cleaved fragments were purified by denaturing PAGE and amplified by RT-PCR. 1The abbreviations used are: RT-PRC, reverse transcriptase PCR; LS, ligation substrate; ADHR, adenine-dependent hairpinribozyme Additionally, during the last two selection rounds, the 5′-cleaved fragments were selected for adenine-specific religation with the 3′-cleaved fragments; after positive selection for adenine-specific RNA cleavage, purified 5′-cleaved fragments were incubated with a large excess of 3′-cleaved fragments in cleavage buffer. Unligated RNAs were recovered and incubated again with a large excess of 3′-cleaved fragments in the presence of adenine. Religated ribozymes were recovered and amplified. During each selection round, the randomized RNA pool was dissolved in the cleavage buffer, heated to 65 °C for 3 min, and cooled slowly (3 °C/min) to 23 °C (denaturation and renaturation steps). The solution was then incubated at room temperature, and the cleavage reaction was stopped by adding 1 volume of loading solution (30 mm EDTA, 80% formamide). The RNA concentration was 50 μm in the first generation (G0), and 20–70 μm in the other selection rounds. The reaction times for negative selection were 2–50 h for G0–G9 and 2–4 h for G9–G11, and the negative selections in G0–G8 were repeated. The uncleaved RNAs recovered from the second negative selection were dissolved in cleavage buffer, denatured and renatured, and then incubated with 3 volumes of cleavage buffer supersaturated in adenine. Reaction times for positive selection were 3–20 h for G0–G5 and 10–40 min for G6–G11. After the loading solution had been added to stop the reaction, the cleaved products were purified by denaturing PAGE, ethanol-precipitated (52.5 μg/ml of glycogen was added as carrier), and resuspended in distilled water. The pooled RNA was reverse transcribed using 20 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT, Invitrogen) with 20 μm reverse primer P2 at 37 °C for 1 h. The cDNA was amplified by PCR with 1 μm each primer (P1 and P2). The thermal cycle program was 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; the cycle was repeated 16 times. After ethanol precipitation and resuspension in water, the newly selected DNA library served to produce the RNA pool for the next selection round by in vitro transcription. During the last two selection rounds, two additional steps following positive selection were performed to isolate ribozymes able to religate in the presence of adenine. First, adenine-cleaved RNA was dissolved in cleavage buffer in the presence of a 10-fold excess of ligation substrate (LS). LS is a 15-nucleotide-long DNA/RNA mixed oligonucleotide (Genset) in which the sequence corresponds to the 3′-cleaved product (Fig. 1). Its 5′-end is composed of 9 ribonucleotides, and its 3′-terminus is composed of 6 deoxyribonucleotides because 2′-OH are not necessary in this region. Cleaved RNA and LS were heated to 65 °C for 3 min and cooled slowly (3 °C/min) to 8 °C (denaturation and renaturation steps in cleavage buffer prior to ligation). The mixture was incubated at 8 °C for 2 h. The ligation reaction was stopped, and unligated fragments were purified by denaturing PAGE. Finally, the unligated RNAs were again dissolved in cleavage buffer in the presence of a 10-fold excess of LS and then denatured and renatured prior to ligation. Three volumes of a 8 °C cleavage buffer supersaturated with adenine were added, and the solution was incubated at 8 °C for 2 h. The ligated products purified by denaturing PAGE were used for reverse transcription as described above. After each cleavage or ligation reaction, aliquots (2 μl containing 0.2–1 μg of RNA) were analyzed by denaturing 10% PAGE and ethidium bromide staining. RNA fragments were revealed by UV trans-illumination and scanned. The light intensities of the fragments were quantified using an NIH Image analyzer. It was thus possible to monitor the evolution of cleavage or ligation efficiencies in the presence or absence of adenine during the selection process. Ribozymes positively selected at G11 were cloned (TOPO TA cloning kit, Invitrogen) after conversion of RNA to double-stranded DNA by RT-PCR. Plasmids were prepared from isolated clones (Plasmix minipreps, Talent), and the cloned DNAs were sequenced. After plasmid purification and in vitrotranscription of the PCR-amplified inserted fragments, individual RNAs were prepared for further studies. Double-stranded DNA templates were prepared from individual plasmids by PCR using primers P1 and P2. The RNAs were transcribed from the DNA templates and purified as described above. Individual RNAs (4 μm) were dissolved in cleavage buffer and subjected to the denaturation and renaturation steps. The solutions were then incubated with 3 volumes of cleavage buffer alone (negative controls) or with 3 volumes of adenine containing cleavage buffer (2.7 mm adenine). Aliquots were removed from the mixtures at various times and added to 1 volume of loading solution. After overnight incubation with adenine or 3 days of incubation in cleavage buffer alone, the reactions were analyzed by denaturing PAGE and ethidium bromide staining. The observed rate constant values (k obs) were calculated using the equation S/(S+L) = a(1 − exp(−k obs t)) (30Komatsu Y. Nobuoka K. Karino-Abe N. Matsuda A. Ohtsuka E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9090-9098Google Scholar), where S is the concentration of the cleaved product, L the concentration of the precursor, t is time, and a is the percentage of cleaved product versus total RNA at equilibrium. Individual RNAs were subjected to overnight adenine-assisted self-cleavage, and the cleaved fragments were purified as described above. Individually cleaved RNAs (4 μm) were dissolved in cleavage buffer with 72 μm LS, denatured, and renatured prior to ligation. The solutions were then incubated with 3 volumes of cleavage buffer either alone (negative controls) or supplemented with 2.7 mm adenine. Reactions were analyzed, and thek obs values were calculated, except that S was taken as the concentration of the ligation product. Individual RNAs (4 μm) were dissolved in cleavage buffer. After denaturation and renaturation, 8 aliquots were prepared and incubated with 3 volumes of varying concentrations of adenine in cleavage buffer (0.027 to 20 mm). Aliquots were removed after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min, the cleavage reactions were analyzed, and thek obs were plotted as a function of adenine concentration. Individual RNAs (4 μm) were dissolved in cleavage buffer with MgCl2 concentrations ranging from 0.1 μm to 10 mm. After denaturation and renaturation, the solutions were incubated with 3 volumes of adenine (30 mm) in cleavage buffer with the corresponding MgCl2concentrations. Aliquots were removed at various times, the cleavage reactions were analyzed, and the k obs values were plotted as a function of MgCl2 concentration. Individual RNAs were dissolved in cleavage buffer and subjected to the denaturation and renaturation steps. Aliquots were incubated with 3 volumes of 3–5 different concentrations of small molecules in cleavage buffer (from 0.1 mm to 150 mm depending on the solubility of the compound). The molecules tested for cis-cleavage were 1-methyladenine, 3-methyladenine, 6-methyladenine, purine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uracil, and imidazole. Aliquots were removed at various times and analyzed as described above. The k obsvalues were plotted as a function of small molecules concentrations. Individual RNAs were dissolved in cleavage buffers with pH values ranging from 4 to 10 prior to the denaturation and renaturation steps. The buffers used were 40 mm sodium acetate for pH 4 and 5, 40 mm HEPES for pH values from 6 to 8.2, and 40 mm glycine for pH 8.6, 9, and 10. After denaturation and renaturation, the solutions were incubated with 3 volumes of 32 mm adenine dissolved in the cleavage buffers with the respective pH values. Aliquots were removed at various times, and the cleavage reactions were analyzed as described above. The experiment was repeated using 32 mm imidazole instead of adenine and were also performed without cofactor. Thek obs values for adenine-assisted cleavage, imidazole-assisted cleavage, and RNA cleavage without cofactor were plotted as a function of pH. In vitro selection began with a pool of 85-nucleotide-long hairpin ribozymes containing 20 degenerate nucleotides. The randomized positions were all located in loop A (4 randomized nucleotides) and in loop B (16 randomized nucleotides). Degeneracy was introduced in these positions because loops A and B contain the nucleotides required for catalytic activity in the wild-type ribozyme (Fig. 1). Our selection procedure was designed to select inactive ribozymes in which catalytic activity could be rescued by the addition of free exogenous adenine. The initial RNA population was composed of ∼1015molecules and expected to express 1012 different ribozyme variants. After transcription from the DNA pool, two successive negative selections were carried out by incubating the transcripts in the absence of free adenine. The uncleaved RNAs were isolated by denaturing PAGE and incubated in the presence of free adenine. The 70-nucleotide-long 5′-cleaved products were purified by PAGE. The selected molecules were converted to DNA and amplified by RT-PCR. The alternation of the negative and positive selection steps was repeated for 12 rounds. The progress of in vitro selection is shown in Fig. 2. During the first four selection rounds, the amount of cleaved RNA was too small to be detected after negative or positive selection. RNA cleavage became detectable as of the fifth selection round (G4), but further selection rounds were necessary to eliminate adenine-independent self-cleaving ribozymes from the population. Adenine-cleaved hairpin ribozymes became predominant in the population at G8. Selection for adenine-assisted self-cleavage was continued to G11. From G9 to G11, the second negative selection step was omitted because most of the adenine-independent self-cleaving ribozymes were removed in G8. In addition, during G10 and G11, adenine-cleaved ribozymes also served to select for adenine-assisted religation. After positive selection and purification of the active molecules, the RNA was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of LS without free adenine. Unligated fragments were purified by PAGE and incubated again with a 10-fold excess of LS in the presence of free adenine (incubation times are shown in Fig. 2). Religated molecules were purified by PAGE and converted to DNA by RT-PCR. During G10, self-cleavage of the negative and positive selections were 1 and 10%, respectively, and the self-ligation product after negative and positive selections for religation were undetectable. During G11, self-cleavage of the negative and positive selections were 1 and 30%, respectively, and self-ligation of the negative and positive selections for religation were 1.5 and 6%, respectively. The RNA pool selected for adenine-assisted cleavage and religation during G11 was converted to DNA by RT-PCR and cloned. Two different sequences were obtained after sequencing of 14 clones: ADHR1 and ADHR2 (adenine-dependenthairpin ribozyme). The sequences and secondary structures are shown in Fig.3 A. The ADHR1 aptamer displays four mutations with respect to the wild-type ribozyme (U20, A36, G38, and C39 instead of A20, G36, A38, and U39 in the wild-type RNA) and the ADHR2 aptamer displays 6 mutations with respect to the wild-type ribozyme (U20, C24, C26, C37, U38 and G39 instead of A20, A24, A26, U37, A38, and U39 in the wild-type RNA). Both aptamers share a common mutation, U20 in place of A20 in the wild-type RNA. As expected, the guanosine located downstream of the cleavage site (G+1), which is not in the initial randomized zone, is conserved. C25 and U42, which were included in the randomized zone, are conserved. These 3 nucleotides are believed to be the major determinants for the stability of the tertiary structure of the wild-type ribozyme by creating H-bond networks that stabilize the ribozyme in its docked conformation (31Wilson T.J. Zhao Z.-Y. Maxwell K. Kontogiannis L. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2291-2302Google Scholar, 32Klostermeier D. Millar D.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14095-14102Google Scholar). It is thus very likely that ADHR1 and ADHR2 share the same global docked and active conformation as the wild-type hairpin ribozyme. In contrast, several critical nucleotides of the catalytic site of the wild-type ribozyme were replaced: G36 and A38 were changed to A36 and G38 in ADHR1; A24, A26, and A38 were changed to C24, C26, and U38 in ADHR2. There must be more significant differences in the conformation at the active site of ADHR1 and ADHR2 compared with the wild-type ribozyme because these nucleotides are located in the vicinity of the scissile phosphate (33Rupert P.B. Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 780-786Google Scholar).Figure 3Analysis of ADHR1 and ADHR2 self-cleavage and self-ligation activities. A, secondary structures of aptamers.

In the experiments carried out without adenine, the rates were too low to reach the end points for which values are needed to calculate the k obs. In effect, after 3 days of incubation of the ribozymes in the absence of adenine, only 2–4% cleavage or ligation was reached. Thus, thek obs values were calculated on the basis of the initial rates of reaction and estimated to be ∼10–00-fold higher than the uncatalyzed reaction under the same condition. During cis-cleavage and cis-ligation, each clone has very little activity in the cleavage buffer alone but becomes active with 2.7 mmadenine (values are shown in Fig. 3 A). Thek obs values are in the same order of magnitude for both aptamers. ADHR1 has slightly higher values than ADHR2, and under these experimental conditions the two ribozymes are only 10–30-fold less active than the wild-type ribozyme. These experiments demonstrate that both mutated hairpin ribozyme aptamers are inactive alone but are activated by adenine. Adenine enhances the aptamer cleavage and ligation activities more than 300-fold. The k obs values for self-cleavage were measured for both adenine-dependent ribozymes as a function of adenine concentration (Fig.4 A). The apparent dissociation constant (K d) values of ADHR1 and ADHR2 for adenine are 7.6 and 2.6 mm, respectively, and thek obs reached at saturating adenine concentration are 0.04 and 0.011 min−1, respectively. The affinity of ADHR2 for adenine is higher than that of ADHR1, but ADHR1 is more effective at saturating adenine concentration. The k obs were also measured as a function of MgCl2 concentration (Fig. 4 B). As expected, millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ are required for catalysis. The apparent K d values of ADHR1 and ADHR2 for Mg2+ are 1 and 4 mm, respectively, andk obs reached at saturating MgCl2concentrations are 0.04 and 0.017 min−1, respectively. ADHR2 needs more Mg2+ than ADHR1 to be fully active, and ADHR1 can reach higher activity at saturating Mg2+concentration. In addition, previous studies (34Chowrira B.M. Berzal-Herranz A. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1088-1095Google Scholar) with comparable wild-type constructs reported 3 mm Mg2+ for 50% cleavage k obs, which thus are similar to ADHR1 and ADHR2. Thek obs values were measured for both adenine-dependent ribozymes in the presence of various concentrations of small molecules (Fig.5). Both aptamers remain inactive in the presence of 3-methyladenine, xanthine, and uracil. This finding indicates that the N-3 and the C-2 positions of adenine are required for recognition or activation. Low cleavage rates were observed in the presence of hypoxanthine with ADHR1 and ADHR2. Hypoxanthine differs from adenine by substitution of the 6-amino group with a carbonyl group. The K d values for hypoxanthine are similar to those of adenine. Hypoxanthine thus likely binds both aptamers in the same way as adenine, without inducing the same catalytic effects. Chemical substitutions at position 6 of adenine rather decrease or disrupt catalysis than binding. In effect, ADHR1 retains low activity in the presence of purine and 6-methyladenine. Their K d values confirm that the 6-amino group of adenine is not involved in ADHR1 recognition. Its absence in purine induces a 40-fold decrease in activity as compared with adenine, but its methylation in 6-methyladenine has no significant effect on activity. Position 6 of adenine is probably involved in hydrogen bond formation required for catalysis. The activation of ADHR1 cleavage induced by imidazole is more striking because, although its affinity is lower compared with adenine, its catalytic efficiency is close to that of adenine (Fig. 5). The imidazole moiety alone is therefore able to induce nearly the same catalytic effect as adenine, even in the absence of its 6-amino group. The imidazole moiety of adenine is thus crucial for catalysis by the ADHR1 ribozyme. In contrast, ADHR2 is capable only of low level self-cleavage in the presence of imidazole. No activity was detected for ADHR2 in the presence of either 6-methyladenine or purine. Compared with the hypoxanthine data, this would mean that the 6-amino group of adenine is able to induce catalysis but not in the same way as ADHR1. Its absence or methylation completely abolishes activity, and its replacement by a carbonyl group yields a 25-fold lower activity with respect to adenine. ADHR2 is active with 1-methyladenine, which has an affinity slightly higher than that of adenine. Substitution at position 1 with a methyl group yields nearly the same catalytic efficiency as adenine. As opposed to ADHR1, which remains inactive with 1-methyladenine, the N-1 atom of adenine is not involved in either ADHR2 recognition or cleavage induction. Taken together, the data related to small molecules indicate that adenine recognition and/or catalysis induction are not achieved in the same manner for ADHR1 and ADHR2. The k obs values at pH ranging from 4 to 10 were measured for both aptamers in the absence or presence of cofactor (32 mm adenine or 32 mmimidazole. Plots of k obs as a function of pH for both aptamers are shown in Fig. 6. In the presence of adenine, the k obs values of ADHR1 are very low, between pH 4 and 6. They increase as of pH 6 and reach a plateau between pH 8.6 and 10. The ADHR1 imidazole pH profile is roughly similar to that of the adenine pH profile; thek obs values in the presence of imidazole are higher at low pH but are two times lower at the plateau than in the presence of adenine. Self-cleavage of ADHR1 in buffer alone yields a flat pH profile. The k obs is not measurable at low pH, and self-cleavage becomes detectable at pH 7.5 and increases slightly with pH. At pH 10, k obs values are 55-fold lower than in the presence of adenine and 25-fold lower than in the presence of imidazole). In the presence of adenine, ADHR2 self-cleavage is very low between pH 4 and 5. It increases as of pH 6 to reach a plateau at pH 8.2. The ADHR2 imidazole pH profile is as flat as the ADHR2 pH profile without cofactor. These results suggest that deprotonation events are rate-limiting for adenine-assisted catalysis by both aptamers. The successful selection procedure allowed us to discover new hairpin ribozymes that are strongly dependent on adenine for their reversible self-cleavage reaction. Screening of 14 selected clones yields two different aptamer sequences. ADHR1 is largely prevalent over ADHR2 in the final selected population (13:1). This can be explained by the cleavage and ligation kinetics studies. First, ADHR1 has slightly higher k obs values. Its relative ratio to ADHR2 probably increases after short-time positive selection steps. In addition, two positive selections for religation were performed during the last two selection rounds (Fig. 2). For ADHR1, both the rate and equilibrium constants for ligation are higher than for ADHR2. Hence, it is easy to understand that ADHR1 predominates over ADHR2 after 12 selection rounds for adenine-assisted cleavage and after two rounds of selection for adenine-assisted religation. This can now be understood in terms of selection conditions. Indeed, ADHR2 requires more Mg2+ than ADHR1 does to be fully active. During in vitro selection the Mg2+ concentration was 6 mm, which is not optimal for ADHR2 catalysis. The analysis of cis-cleavage and cis-ligation kinetics indicates that the self-cleavage reaction in the presence of adenine is reversible. This confirms that adenine is part of the catalyst and not of the reactants. If adenine were acting as a reactant (for example in direct nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphate), it would have been trapped either in the 3′- or 5′-side products. In the first case, religation of the 5′-side product with fresh LS (carrying a 5′-OH end) would not have succeeded either in the presence or absence of adenine. In the second case, the 5′-side product would not have religated or would have been able to religate either in the presence or absence of free adenine. ADHR1 and ADHR2 thus catalyze the same kind of reaction as the wild-type hairpin ribozyme. Hydrolysis of the RNA backbone proceeds via the nucleophilic attack of the scissile phosphate by the adjacent 2′-oxygen, and the release products are 2′-3′ cyclic phosphate and 5′-OH termini. The investigations of the effects of various adenine analogs and the studies of the effects of pH were undertaken to determine the level of implication of adenine in catalytic self-cleavage of ADHR1 and ADHR2. The results of these studies can be explained in several ways. First, it is possible that both aptamers are subjected to a pH-triggered conformational change enhancing catalysis. This remains unlikely, because the pH profile of wild-type ribozyme catalysis is flat between pH 5 and 9 (35Nesbitt S. Hegg L.A. Fedor M.J. Chem. Biol. 1997; 8: 619-630Google Scholar). ADHRs 1 and 2 are believed to share a tertiary structure close to that of wild-type, and such a pH-dependent conformational switch observed in both aptamers but absent from the wild-type does not seem very likely. The more probable explanation would be that both aptamers use catalytic strategies in which a deprotonation event (absent or not detectable in the wild-type RNA) is rate-limiting in the chemical cleavage mechanism (acid/base catalysis). Proton transfer would thus be the limiting step in catalysis, and the protons could come from ribozyme chemical groups with shifted pKa values or from exogenous adenine used as cofactor for cleavage catalysis. Indeed, the use of catalytic Mg2+-complexed hydroxide ions cannot formally be excluded, but this last hypothesis remains very unlikely because the wild-type ribozyme does not use Mg2+ in catalysis (36Young K.J. Gill F. Grasby J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3760-3766Google Scholar). Indeed, Mg2+ dependence of both aptamers is similar to wild-type Mg2+ requirements. It is thus probable that ADHR1 and ADHR2 require Mg2+ only for folding and not for catalysis per se. The involvement of exogenous adenine in direct catalysis is probably different for ADHR1 and ADHR2. ADHR1 is able to react with a wider variety of adenine analogs than ADHR2. Among these analogs, imidazole (pKavalue, 7) yields comparable catalytic efficiency as adenine. It is thus probable that the imidazole moiety of adenine is involved directly in the catalytic step. The N-9 atom of adenine has a pKa value of 9.8, which can be shifted toward neutrality as a result of the interaction with ADHR1 RNA. The N-1 atom (pKa value, 4.1), in which methylation abolishes activity, is also a candidate for acid/base catalysis, but it is not present in imidazole. Models in which N-9- or N-1-deprotonated adenine directly abstract the proton of the 2′-attacking nucleophile oxygen to enhance the catalytic rate (general base mechanism) or chemical mechanisms in which N-9- or N-1-protonated adenine releases its proton to the 5′-oxo leaving groups (general acid mechanism) are thus consistent with our data. The involvement of adenine in ADHR2 catalysis seems to be different. The imidazole part of adenine seems to be less involved than in ADHR1 catalysis. Methylation of the N-1 atom has no effect on catalysis. Mechanisms involving the adenine N-1 atom with a neutral pKa available for the abstraction of the 2′ attacking hydroxide proton or for proton release to the 5′-oxo leaving group can thus be excluded for purposes of ADHR2 catalysis. Adenine-assisted ADHR2 self-cleavage seems to be more sensitive than ADHR1 to chemical substitutions at position 6 of adenine. The 6-amino group may thus play a more important role in catalysis by ADHR2 than by ADHR1. We propose two additional chemical explanations. In the first case, ADHR2-bound adenine would simply help to position the RNA reacting groups and would not act directly on catalysis. In the second case, exogenous adenine would act as wild-type ribozyme adenosine 38 by stabilizing the transition state with hydrogen bonds involving its 6-amino group (37Ruppert P.B. Massey A.P. Sigurdsson S.T. Ferré-d'Amaré A.R. Science. 2002; 298: 1421-1424Google Scholar). In these two models, the pH profiles of the ADHR2 adenine-assisted self-cleavage would be due to protonation state changes in RNA catalytic groups. ADHR1 and ADHR2 aptamers do not use the same catalytic strategies as the wild-type hairpin ribozyme, which is believed to use a transition state stabilization strategy. We have thus selected new hairpin ribozyme variants that are dependent strictly on the presence of exogenous adenine for catalysis. These new adenine-dependent ribozymes act with different catalytic strategies with respect to wild-type ribozyme, probably having different ways of handling exogenous adenine as cofactor for catalysis. These aptamers are of great interest considering the prebiotic RNA world hypothesis. Adenine is itself a prebiotic analog of histidine and could have been used by ribozymes of the RNA world in the same way as histidine is used by present day enzymes. Our work thus supports the view that the use of small exogenous cofactors by ribozymes of the RNA world could have constituted an easy way of expanding its catalytic and metabolic repertoires.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Google Scholar). These diverse effects can result in apparently contradictory experimental findings, as experimental data support both deleterious and beneficial roles for TNFα in, for example, preservation of myocardial function following ischemia and reperfusion (5Eddy L.J.

A. 2000; 97: 5456-5461Google Scholar). The complexity of the physiologic effects of TNFα is mimicked by the mechanisms by which it generates signals to produce those effects. TNFα interacts with two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, ubiquitously expressed on cells of the cardiovascular system. TNFR1 is dominant in most cell types; an independent role for TNFR2 is yet to be established (4Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Google Scholar). After ligand binding, a conformational change in the pretrimerized TNF receptor complex causes dissociation of the SODD protein and, in a series of protein-protein interactions, intracellular mediators are recruited to the cytosolic portion of the receptor (9Chan F.K. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Google Scholar). TNFR1 activates two broad signaling pathways, both initiated by the recruitment of TRADD to TNFR1. One pathway, mediated by the subsequent recruitment of FADD, results in caspase 8 activation and initiation of apoptosis. Conversely, the survival pathway involves association of RIP and TRAF-2 with TRADD. The TRADD·RIP·TRAF-2 complex recruits the IKK signalosome to TNFR1 thus activating NFκB. In addition, the TRADD·RIP·TRAF-2 complex also activates MAPK pathways that lead to AP-1 activation (4Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Google Scholar, 10Zhang S.Q. Kovalenko A. Cantarella G. Wallach D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Google Scholar). During inflammation, multiple cytokines and stimulants of vascular endothelium are released. Thus, any pathophysiological effect produced by TNFα must take place in the context of 舠cross-talk舡 with those mediators. The most common class of receptor for these mediators are G protein-linked receptors, multiple forms of which are expressed on vascular cells. One mediator of particular importance in ischemia and inflammation is the eicosanoid thromboxane A2(TXA2), released from activated platelets and damaged vessel walls. Local and systemic elevations in TXA2 are reported in several thrombotic and vascular diseases (11Ogletree M.L. Fed. Proc. 1987; 46: 133-138Google Scholar). TXA2 mediates vascular damage by inducing platelet activation, vasoconstriction, vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy/hyperplasia, and by converting the endothelial surface to a 舠prothrombotic舡 state. These biological actions of TXA2are mediated by a G protein-linked receptor (TP) of which two alternatively spliced subtypes, TPα and TPॆ, exist in humans (12Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Google Scholar,13Raychowdhury M.K. Yukawa M. Collins L.J. McGrail S.H. Kent K.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7011Google Scholar). Although the intracellular tail of TPॆ differs from that of TPα, these isoforms couple to 807 of the same G proteins (14Walsh M. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 164-182Google Scholar). Differences in signaling reported so far mediate receptor trafficking and desensitization (15Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Driss Rochdi M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7079-7085Google Scholar, 16Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Google Scholar, 17Walsh M. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. J. Biol.

In this study, we sought to investigate whether stimulation of TP, a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor that is activated during ischemia and inflammation, could alter TNFα-induced endothelial cell apoptosis and leukocyte adhesion in vivo. Furthermore, we tested the possibility that such an effect resulted from a selective effect on specific signal transduction pathways employed by TNFα. The data present a currently unrecognized interaction between TNFα and ligands for G protein-coupled receptors that may provide a mechanism by which endothelial cell death occurs during inflammation. The G protein inhibitors NF023 (Gαi), NF449 (Gαs), GP antagonist 2A (Gαq), pertussis toxin, and GDP were all purchased fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem. All other chemicals were of suitable grade and purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Human endothelial cells (HEC) isolated from umbilical veins were cultured as reported previously (18Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A. J. Biol.

HEC were stimulated for up to 24 h with media alone (Control), recombinant human TNFα or IL-1ॆ (100 units/ml in all experiments unless otherwise stated), the TXA2 mimetic IBOP (0–200 nm), or the TP blocker SQ29548 (5 ॖm) (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (19Hicks C. Sleigh M.J. Chesterman C.N. J. Immunol.

Confluent monolayers of first passage HEC were stimulated with TNFα, IBOP, or the two in combination for 8 h and were washed extensively before the addition of leukocytes. U937 cells, a leukocyte cell line, were labeled with 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-AM (2 ॖm) for 30 min and 1 × 106 cells were added to stimulated HEC monolayers for 2 h. At the conclusion, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 17 (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min. U937 attachment was quantitated in a fluorometric plate reader using fluorescein isothiocyanate filters. The modulation of TNFα by TXA2in vivo was analyzed by monitoring the passage of leukocytes along postcapillary venules in the externalized cremaster muscle as previously described (20Kaul D.K.

C57-black mice were injected intraperitoneally with murine TNFα (150 pm), the TXA2 mimetic IBOP (50 nm), or the two together and prepared for intravital microscopy after 4 h. Adherent leukocytes were quantified per 100 ॖm of vessel length. Extravasated leukocytes were determined as the number of interstitial leukocytes adjacent (within 30 ॖm) to venules. Confluent HEC were treated with IBOP, IL-1ॆ, or TNFα alone or in combination for 5 min. Monolayers were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and scraped into immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 17 (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.57 (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin). Cell suspensions were sonicated, incubated on ice for 30 min, and clarified by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, protein content was determined and 300 ॖg of total protein was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with protein G-agarose beads coated with saturating amounts of antibodies to TNFR1, TNFR2, NFκB (p65RelA) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), RIP, or TRADD (Transduction Laboratories). The resulting immune complexes were recovered after centrifugation by boiling for 10 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Nuclear proteins were isolated as previously reported (21Ashton A.W. Watanabe G. Albanese C. Harrington E.O. Ware J.A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20805-20811Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, aliquots of whole cell lysates (30 ॖg) or isolated immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions using 107 acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described (18Ashton A.W. Yokota R. John G. Zhao S. Suadicani S.O. Spray D.C. Ware J.A.

An α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was used to control for loading. For annexin V staining, HEC stimulated with IBOP, TNFα, or the two in combination (16 h) were harvested using trypsin/EDTA and stained for annexin V using the Pharmingen annexin-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining kit (Pharmingen). Annexin V staining was quantitated using flow cytometry. Following treatment with TNFα, IBOP, or the two in combination for 16 h, HEC were scraped into lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and protein concentration was estimated. Protease reactions utilized cleavage of the chromogenic peptide substrates Z-DEVD-p-nitroanilide and Ac-IETD-p-nitroanilide for caspase 3- and 8-like activity, respectively (Biomol ResearchLaboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Caspase activity assays were carried out in reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 207 (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.17 (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 10 mm caspase substrate) using 300 ॖg of total protein. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and cleavage of colorimetric substrates quantitated at 415 nm. HEC were transfected with the NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter construct pBII-Luc(2× Igk κB-fos-luciferase) (22Cheng G. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 963-973Google Scholar) or STAT1 oligonucleotides using the GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Transfected HEC were stimulated with TNFα or IL-1ॆ alone or in combination with IBOP for 16 h and relative luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase gene reporter kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). STAT1 sense (5′-ggTggCAggATgTCTCAgTgG 3′) and antisense (5′-CCACTgAgACATCCTgCCACC-3′) oligonucleotides were transfected into cells 24 h prior to assay; preliminary experiments established that this time was sufficient for the ablation of STAT1 expression. Confluent HEC were exposed to TNFα or IBOP or both agents for up to 8 h. HEC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and total mRNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA (5 ॖg of each sample) was separated on a denaturing 17 agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and blotted for leukocyte adhesion molecule (LAM) expression as previously described (23Hurwitz A.A. Lyman W.D. Guida M.P. Calderon T.M. Berman J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1631-1636Google Scholar). Full-length human cDNA probes to ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and GAPDH mRNAs were made from all cDNAs by random priming using the Megaprime Labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). After blotting, membranes were dried and autoradiographed for the appropriate period of time with changes in mRNA levels quantitated by scanning densitometry. Data were pooled and statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Stimulation with the TXA2 mimetic IBOP (50 nm) increased expression of LAM molecules on HEC, with maximal induction after 16 h for ICAM-1 and 6–8 h for VCAM-1 and E-selectin (p ≤ 0.001, Fig.1A). Induction of LAM expression by IBOP was concentration-dependent. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression on HEC were maximally induced at IBOP concentrations ≥25 nm (IC50 12 nm,p ≤ 0.005) at 16 and 6 h, respectively. E-selectin was maximally induced at IBOP concentrations ≥50 nm (IC50 25 nm) after 6 h (p ≤ 0.01, Fig. 1B). U46619, another TP agonist, also stimulated LAM expression on HEC with maximal induction at 400 nm and time courses similar to those shown for IBOP (data not shown). Inclusion of the TP antagonist SQ29548 (5 ॖm) abrogated IBOP-induced LAM expression (data not shown), indicating the effect was mediated by the TXA2receptor (TP). LAM expression is regulated by increased transcription, which in turn is mediated by NFκB (24Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Pober J.S. Wick T.M. Konkle B.A. Schwartz B.S. Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561Google Scholar). HEC express both TP isoforms, TPα and TPॆ. In cell lines overexpressing each of the two TP isoforms on a null background, NFκB nuclear translocation (Fig. 1C) and LAM expression (data not shown) were found to follow ligation of TPॆ, but not of TPα. NFκB nuclear translocation in response to IBOP in TPॆ expressing cells was inhibited by loading the cells with GDP, indicating the process was mediated by G proteins, and by two pharmacological inhibitors of the heterotrimeric G protein Gαi (Fig. 1C). Antagonists of Gαq and Gαs were ineffective, consistent with the concept that this process was mediated by Gαisignaling. We hypothesized that TXA2 may regulate expression of LAM induced by other proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-1ॆ or TNFα. TNFα and IL-1ॆ increased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin by an average of 5.5-, 12-, and 15-fold, respectively (p ≤ 0.001) (Fig.2A). Inclusion of IBOP with IL-1ॆ did not significantly alter the induction of LAMs, suggesting that IL-1ॆ and TP stimulation were neither synergistic nor additive. In contrast, stimulation with both TNFα and IBOP abrogated the induction of LAM (p ≤ 0.001 versus TNFα) (Fig. 2A). IBOP-mediated inhibition of TNFα-induced expression of ICAM-1 (p ≤ 0.001, Fig. 2B), VCAM-1, and E-selectin (data not shown) was blocked by SQ29548 (5 ॖm), indicating that TP binding was a requirement for this effect. SQ29548 did not alter basal or TNFα-induced LAM expression (Fig. 2B). The inhibition of LAM expression by IBOP in TNFα-stimulated HEC was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 2C). TNFα treatment induced a 4.5-fold increase in ICAM-1 expression (Fig.2C), above that seen with untreated HEC. Increasing concentrations of the TXA2 mimetic IBOP attenuated the induction of ICAM-1 by TNFα with inhibition greatest at IBOP concentrations ≥100 nm (p ≤ 0.01, IC50 = 50 nm) (Fig. 2C). The induction of E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression were similarly inhibited by IBOP in TNFα-stimulated HEC (data not shown). Inhibition of LAM expression on TNFα-stimulated HEC was not because of alterations in the time course for maximal expression, as cells stimulated with both agents displayed only basal expression of ICAM-1 (Fig. 2D), VCAM-1, and E-selectin (data not shown) at all time points. Thus, the prevention of TNFα-induced LAM expression by TXA2mimetics did not result from cross-talk between the two agents in which the time to peak expression was altered. Consistent with these observations, IBOP-mediated inhibition of LAM expression prevented leukocyte adhesion to TNFα-stimulated HEC. Stimulation with either the TXA2 mimetic IBOP or TNFα induced a 3–4-fold increase in adhesion of the monocytic cell line U937 to HEC (p ≤ 0.005, Fig.3A). Simultaneous treatment with both agents resulted in U937 adhesion similar to that in untreated controls (p ≥ 0.4, Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed when the adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall and their extravasation from the vasculature into surrounding tissues was examined in vivo. Injection of recombinant murine TNFα (150 pm) into mice resulted in a 7- and 11-fold increase in leukocyte adhesion to and extravasation from, respectively (p ≤ 0.0001), the venous network of cremaster muscle preparations after 4 h (Fig. 3B). Co-stimulation with IBOP (50 nm) resulted in an attenuation of TNFα-mediated leukocyte adhesion and extravasation (p ≤ 0.005 versus TNFα alone), with leukocyte rolling increased 3-fold (data not shown). Consistent with the observation above that ligation of TPॆ induces LAM expression in EC, IBOP stimulation did not cause an increase in leukocyte traffickingin vivo (Fig. 3B), as a mouse homologue for TPॆ has not been identified, and the murine TP resembles the human TPα isoform. Regulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin by TNFα depends upon increased transcription (24Cines D.B. Pollak E.S. Buck C.A. Loscalzo J. Zimmerman G.A. McEver R.P. Pober J.S. Wick T.M. Konkle B.A. Schwartz B.S. Barnathan E.S. McCrae K.R. Hug B.A. Schmidt A.M. Stern D.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 3527-3561Google Scholar). To determine how TP inhibits LAM expression in response to TNFα, we examined the pattern of LAM mRNA expression. Fig. 3C shows that only ICAM-1 mRNA was detectable in untreated endothelial cells by Northern blot analysis. TNFα and IBOP both induced ICAM-1 expression 9-fold over controls after stimulation for 8 h (Fig. 3C). Both agents also induced robust expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin after 3 h. The equivalent induction of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin mRNA by TNFα and TP stimulation is consistent with the pattern of protein expression determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the results in panels A and B, incubation with both TNFα and IBOP prevented the increased mRNA expression for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin observed with either agent alone (Fig. 3C). Comparison of the ICAM-1, VCAM-1 promoters, and E-selectin promoters indicated that NFκB and AP1 were factors that possibly indicated transcriptional regulation by TNFα. To examine whether TNFα-stimulated NFκB activity is regulated by TXA2mimetics, we transfected HEC with a NFκB-sensitive luciferase reporter construct. TNFα, IL-1ॆ, and IBOP treatment induced luciferase activity in transfected HEC to similar levels when used individually (Fig. 4A,p ≤ 0.005). In contrast, IBOP abrogated the transcriptional activity of NFκB when used in combination with TNFα, but not IL-1ॆ (Fig. 4A). Nuclear translocation and full transcriptional activity of NFκB require phosphorylation of the NFκB inhibitor protein, IκB (4Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3261-3270Google Scholar). Treatment with TNFα, IL-1ॆ, or IBOP for 20 min increased IκBα phosphorylation in HEC lysates 10–12-fold and induced nuclear translocation of p65RelA, the most common NFκB subunit. Untreated endothelial cells had little or no phosphorylated IκB or nuclear p65RelA as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig.4B). In accordance with the luciferase data (showing a lack of NFκB-mediated transcriptional activity), co-stimulation with IBOP prevented the nuclear translocation of p65RelA and the enhanced IκBα phosphorylation observed with TNFα, but not IL-1ॆ, alone (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of TNFα-induced NFκB activation by TP was prevented both in GDP-loaded cells, showing that the effect was G protein-mediated, and was also blocked by an antagonist of Gαq signaling, but not that of Gαs or Gαi (Fig. 4C). IBOP stimulation also abrogated TNFα-induced NFκB activation in cell lines expressing TPα or TPॆ alone (data not shown), consistent with the previously reported data that both TP isoforms are coupled to Gαq (14Walsh M. Foley J.F. Kinsella B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 164-182Google Scholar). Interestingly, IBOP not only inhibited TNFα-induced NFκB nuclear translocation but also reversed the process (Fig. 4D). Simultaneous addition of TNF and IBOP (30 min) inhibited the nuclear accumulation of NFκB observed with either agent alone. TNFα stimulation for 15 min induced nuclear NFκB staining and IκB phosphorylation similar to that obtained after 30 min (Fig.4D, lane 3 versus lane 5). Addition of IBOP (to TNFα-stimulated HEC) for a further 15 min resulted in an absence of IκB phosphorylation and nuclear NFκB staining (lane 6). In addition, NFκB was found to be reassociated with IκB in HEC treated with TNFα for 15 min prior to the addition of the TP agonist for a further 15 min, indicating that the levels of free NFκB were returned to baseline (Fig. 4D, lane 6 versus lane 5). The reciprocal was also true, as addition of TNFα after IBOP stimulation reversed the activation of NFκB, decreased IκB phosphorylation, and increased IκB·NFκB complexes (Fig. 4D, lane 8 versus lane 7). These data indicate that TP agonists both inhibit the activation of NFκB by TNFα and also reverse previously activated NFκB. NFκB activation by IL-1ॆ and TNFα converge at the IKK signalosome and share all distal elements. The inability of TXA2 mimetics to prevent IL-1ॆ-mediated NFκB activation indicates that the pathways involved may be specific to TNFα. Stimulation with either IBOP or TNFα alone, or together, did not alter the cellular expression of any of the proteins investigated (data not shown). Thus, we immunoprecipitated TNFR1 and TNFR2 and blotted for the expected proteins to investigate whether TP stimulation altered the protein-protein interactions evoked by TNFα signaling. None of the proteins tested were recruited to the cytoplasmic tail of TNFR1 or TNFR2 in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 5,lanes 1 and 2). TNFα stimulation induced robust association of TRADD, RIP, TRAF-2, and IKKγ with TNFR1. TRADD associated with TNFR1 to a similar degree in the presence or absence of IBOP. In contrast, IBOP co-stimulation prevented association of RIP, TRAF-2, and IKKγ with TNFR1 (Fig. 5A, lane 4). Furthermore, neither TNFR1 nor TRADD co-immunoprecipitated with either anti-RIP or TRAF-2 antibodies in the presence of TNFα and IBOP (data not shown). This indicates that the interaction of RIP and TRAF-2 with TRADD, which occur independently, were both inhibited by IBOP. STAT-1 phosphorylation at Tyr701 was recently reported to be part of the TNFR1·TRADD complex, and inhibited TRADD-TRAF-2/RIP interactions without influencing TRADD-FADD interactions (25Wang Y. Wu T.R. Cai S. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TNFα-induced STAT1-TNFR1 interaction was increased 3-fold by co-stimulation with the TXA2 mimetic IBOP (Fig.5A). TNFα was found to increase STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), which was augmented 3-fold by co-stimulation with IBOP. IBOP alone did not stimulate STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig.5B), however, suggesting that the enhancement of TNF2-induced STAT1 phosphorylation by IBOP and TNFα is likely a result of another mechanism, such as inhibition of phosphatase activity. As is the case with inhibition of NFκB, the IBOP-enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 was reduced by inhibition of Gαqsignaling (Fig. 5B). Thus, the abrogation of TNFR1 NFκB signaling by IBOP may result from a TP-mediated enhancement of STAT1 activation by TNFα. When potential alterations in TNFR2 signaling were examined, we observed that TRAF-2 bound to TNFR2 and associated with NIK in TNFα-stimulated HEC (Fig. 5C). Co-stimulation with IBOP and TNFα prevented association of NIK and TRAF-2, but not TRAF-2 and TNFR2. Furthermore, TP stimulation induced the association of RIP with TNFR2, which does not occur following TNFα alone, in contrast to the case with TNFR1 (Fig. 5C). Thus, TXA2 mimetics may enhance those aspects of TNFR2 signaling that result in apoptosis, as well as inhibit NFκB activation, by redirecting RIP to associate with TNFR2. In this model, the effects of TP stimulation on the recruitment of signaling intermediates to TNFR1 and TNFR2 depend upon the increased association of STAT1 with TNFR1. To explore further the causative role of STAT1, we used antisense oligonucleotides to antagonize STAT1 expression. Transfection of HEC with the STAT1 antisense oligonucleotides abrogated STAT1 expression over a period of 16 h, and did not affect HEC viability. STAT1 sense oligonucleotides did not affect STAT1 expression during the same time course (data not shown). When STAT1 oligonucleotide-treated HEC were stimulated, those HEC treated with sense oligonucleotides were not found to differ from untransfected cells (Fig. 5, A and C). In contrast, STAT1 antisense oligonucleotides ablated the interfering effects of TP stimulation, thus allowing RIP, TRAF-2, and IKKγ to be recruited to TNFR1. Similarly, the recruitment of NIK to TNFR2 was also restored and the recruitment of RIP did not occur. Thus, the enhanced phosphorylation and recruitment of STAT1 to TNFR1 in the presence of IBOP is a crucial step in the antagonism of TNFα-induced NFκB activation by TP st"
https://openalex.org/W2009566997,"Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are structurally complex polysaccharides critically engaged in a wide range of cell and tissue functions. Any structure-based approach to study their respective biological functions is facilitated by the use of select heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes with unique substrate specificities. We recently reported of one such enzyme, the Δ4,5-glycuronidase cloned from Flavobacterium heparinumand recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (Myette, J. R., Shriver, Z., Kiziltepe, T., McLean, M. W., Venkataraman, G., and Sasisekharan, R. (2002) Biochemistry41, 7424–7434). In this study, we likewise report the molecular cloning of the 2-O-sulfatase from the same bacterium and its recombinant expression as a soluble, highly active enzyme. At the protein level, the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase possesses considerable sequence homology to other members of a large sulfatase family, especially within its amino terminus, where the highly conserved sulfatase domain is located. Within this domain, we have identified by sequence homology the critical active site cysteine predicted to be chemically modified as a formylglycine in vivo. We also present a characterization of the biochemical properties of the enzyme as it relates to optimalin vitro reaction conditions and a kinetic description of its substrate specificity. In particular, we demonstrate that in addition to the fact that the enzyme exclusively hydrolyzes the sulfate at the 2-O-position of the uronic acid, it also exhibits a kinetic preference for highly sulfated glucosamines within each disaccharide unit, especially those possessing a 6-O-sulfate. The sulfatase also displays a clear kinetic preference for disaccharides with ॆ1→4 linkages but is able, nevertheless, to hydrolyze unsaturated, 2-O-sulfated chondroitin disaccharides. Finally, we describe the substrate-product relationship of the 2-O-sulfatase to the Δ4,5-glycuronidase and the analytical value of using both of these enzymes in tandem for elucidating heparin/heparan sulfate composition.

Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar, 3Shriver Z. Liu D. Sasisekharan R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 71-77Google Scholar). Their structural diversity is largely a consequence of the variable number and position of sulfates present within a single HSGAG chain. Because of their highly anionic character, these polysaccharides historically have been relegated to an exclusively structural role, namely as a sort of hydration gel and scaffold comprising the extracellular matrix. Contrary to this limited perception, however, HSGAGs actually play an important and dynamic function in many critical biological processes ranging from development (4Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar) and tissue repair (5Simeon A. Wegrowski Y. Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 962-968Google Scholar) to apoptosis (6Ishikawa Y.

These polysaccharides are also central players in several pathological conditions such as cancer (8Selva E.M. Perrimon N. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 67-80Google Scholar, 9Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Google Scholar), angiogenesis (10Folkman J. Shing Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1992; 313: 355-364Google Scholar, 11Vlodavsky I. Elkin M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1502-1511Google Scholar), athleroscelerosis (13Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Vlodavsky I. Levkovitz H. Avner R. Eisenberg S. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 1-8Google Scholar), and microbial infectivity (14Liu J. Thorp S.C. Med. Res. Rev. 2002; 22: 1-25Google Scholar). HSGAGs do so as part of proteoglycans found at the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix, where they mediate signaling pathways and cell-cell communication by modulating the bioavailability and temporal-spatial distribution of growth factors, cytokines, and morphogens (15Tumova S. Woods A. Couchman J.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 269-288Google Scholar) in addition to various receptors and extracellular adhesion molecules (16Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 485-493Google Scholar). We must now therefore appreciate the fact that HSGAG structure and function are inextricably related.A study of the HSGAG structure-function paradigm (17Gallagher J.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1206-1209Google Scholar) requires the ability to determine both the overall composition of biologically relevant HSGAGs as well as ultimately ascertaining their actual linear sequence (fine structure). Invaluable toward this realization has been the availability of several chemical and enzymatic reagents that are able to cleave HSGAGs in a structure-specific fashion. One example of an important class of GAG-degrading enzyme is the heparin lyases (heparinases) originally isolated from the Gram-negative soil bacteriumFlavobacterium heparinum. 2Whereas Flavobacterium is the commonly used nomenclature, the genus Pedobacter is the currently accepted taxon for this heparinolytic bacteria.2Whereas Flavobacterium is the commonly used nomenclature, the genus Pedobacter is the currently accepted taxon for this heparinolytic bacteria. Each of the three heparinases encoded by this microorganism cleaves both heparin and heparan sulfate with a substrate specificity that is generally based on the differential sulfation pattern that exists within each GAG chain (18Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Google Scholar, 19Rhomberg A.J. Ernst S. Sasisekharan R. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4176-4181Google Scholar). In fact, F. heparinum uses several additional enzymes in an apparently sequential manner to first depolymerize and then subsequently desulfate heparin/heparan sulfate. The molecular cloning of each of these enzymes would be an important first step toward their systematic use in vitro. In addition to heparinase I (20Sasisekharan R. Bulmer M. Moremen K.W. Cooney C.L. Langer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3660-3664Google Scholar), we have recently cloned one of these enzymes, the Δ4,5-unsaturated glycuronidase (1Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Google Scholar). This enzyme has also been recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli as a highly active enzyme. Because of its rather unusual substrate specificity, this enzyme has already proven to be a useful addition to our property-encoded nomenclature-MALDI-based carbohydrate sequencing methodology (21Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Google Scholar). The availability of specific HSGAG sulfatases would make our enzyme repertoire complete.In this paper, we likewise describe the molecular cloning of the 2-O-sulfatase from F. heparinum and its recombinant expression in E. coli as a soluble, highly active enzyme. This enzyme is a member of a highly conserved sulfatase family as defined by a signature sulfatase domain located toward its amino terminus. We also present a preliminary description of its biochemical properties in addition to a kinetic description of the enzyme's substrate specificity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the sulfatase as a tool for probing HSGAG composition, especially when the enzyme is used in tandem with the Δ4,5-glycuronidase. In the accompanying paper (40Raman R. Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Pojasek K. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12167-12174Google Scholar), we describe the structure-function relationship of this enzyme in greater detail, including the mapping of a critically modified active cysteine to a formylglycine as well as the construction of a structure-based homology model of the enzyme active site.DISCUSSIONHeparin and related heparan sulfate are structurally complex glycosaminoglycans. Their extensive chemical heterogeneity plays out in a functional context, namely in dictating how these linear oligosaccharides mediate a diverse number of biological signaling pathways. One of the more formidable challenges currently facing the glycobiology field is the design of effective analytical methods to study this structure-function relationship at the molecular level. Structure-specific enzymatic tools are indispensable toward meeting this challenge. The utility of HSGAG-degrading enzymes as such has been considered for quite a long time. The heparin lyases (heparinases) fromF. heparinum are an excellent example of how such enzymes have been put to such a use. However, whereas the heparinases may be an important prototype, additional HSGAG-degrading enzymes with more defined substrate specificities are now required to refine present methods for sequencing these complex carbohydrates. Toward this end, we have recently cloned from the flavobacterial genome an unsaturated HSGAG glycuronidase (1Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Google Scholar) with a rather unusual substrate specificity (31Warnick C.T. Linker A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 568-572Google Scholar). The Δ4,5-glycuronidase can be recombinantly expressed in E. coli as a soluble, highly active enzyme. We have shown how this readily purified enzyme can be used as an enzymatic tool to refine our property-encoded nomenclature-MALDI-based method for sequencing heparinase-derived HSGAG oligosaccharides (21Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the molecular cloning, recombinant expression, and biochemical characterization of another highly useful flavobacterial HSGAG-degrading enzyme, the 2-O-sulfatase.The cloned, full-length gene encodes an open reading frame of 468 amino acids (Fig. 2), with a predicted molecular mass of 51.9 kDa. This theoretical molecular weight is ∼10,000 less than the value reported in the literature (22McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Google Scholar). Based on its amino acid composition, the encoded protein is quite basic (theoretical pI of 8.75). A further analysis of its primary amino acid sequence unequivocally places this open reading frame as a member of a larger sulfatase family. Members of this superfamily all possess a defining sulfatase domain that resides within the amino terminus and includes the signature motif (C/S)XPXRXXXX(S/T)G (25Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Google Scholar). Demarcating this consensus sequence is the invariant active site cysteine or serine that is covalently modified as a formylglycine. From our sequence alignment, we predict cysteine at position 82 to be, in fact, the covalently modified residue. An empirical demonstration of this active-site aldehyde at this position is made in the following paper (40Raman R. Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Pojasek K. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12167-12174Google Scholar).Whereas the cloned flavobacterial sulfatase exhibits the highest sequence similarity to the bacterial arylsulfatases (especially the arylsulfatase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa), we point out that a limited homology of the 2-O-sulfatase does extend to the mammalian glycosaminoglycan sulfatases functioning in the lysosomal degradation pathway (see Fig. 1 in the accompanying paper (40Raman R. Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Pojasek K. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12167-12174Google Scholar)). As is the case for the bacterial enzymes, this sequence homology is strongest in the NH2 terminus, where the putative sulfatase domain resides. Among the human lysosomal enzymes, it is the galactosamine (N-acetyl)-6-sulfate sulfatase (chondroitin 6-O-sulfatase) that exhibits the closest similarity with the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase; the two enzymes possess ∼267 identity when comparing their entire protein sequences. There are also two functionally related lysosomal sulfatases, which specifically hydrolyze the 2-OH-position of uronic acid. These enzymes are the iduronate-2-sulfate sulfatase (32Bielicki J. Freeman C. Clements P.R. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 75-86Google Scholar) and the glucuronic 2-sulfate sulfatase (33Freeman C. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 209-216Google Scholar). The iduronate-2-sulfate sulfatase and flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase exhibit only a limited sequence homology (less than 227 identity), however.Like the Δ4,5-glycuronidase, we successfully expressed the 2-O-sulfatase in E. coli, from which several milligrams of highly active, soluble enzyme were readily purified. As was also the case for the glycuronidase, we found that the yield of soluble recombinant enzyme was greatly improved by the engineered removal of the hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence composed of the first 24 amino acids. This signal sequence was predicted by the Von Heinje method, which also identified the likely signal peptidase cleavage recognition sequence AXAXA. With only one exception, we have identified a putative signal sequence in all of the flavobacterial HSGAG-degrading enzymes examined to date. The general presence of this tag, therefore, would suggest a common periplasmic locale within the flavobacterium for glycosaminoglycan degradation.Our initial assessment of 2-O-sulfatase activity was based upon the use of a few select unsaturated heparin disaccharide substrates. Desulfation was unequivocally specific for the 2-O-position (Fig. 5A). Our examination of the biochemical conditions for optimal enzymatic activity yielded several observations. First, 2-O-sulfatase activity exhibited a pH profile generally in agreement with previously published results (22McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Google Scholar), albeit with a narrower pH range (6.0–7.0) in which the enzyme was most active. The enzyme exhibited maximal catalytic efficiency at pH 6.5 with essentially no activity observed at the outlying pH values of 5 and 8 (Fig. 4A). A sharply defined pH optima of 6.5 clearly implicates a catalytic role of one or more histidines. Of the 8 histidines present in the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase, His-136 and His-191 are highly conserved among the sulfatases examined. Catalytically important histidines have been observed within the active site of several sulfatase crystal structures including human lysosomalN-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) (27Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Google Scholar) and arylsulfatase A (25Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Google Scholar) as well as the arysulfatase from P. aeriginosa (34Boltes I. Czapinska H. Kahnert A. von Bulow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 483-491Google Scholar) to which the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase appears to be most closely related. We have in fact used the structures of these related enzymes to construct a highly informative homology model for the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase. This model and its structure-function implications are presented in the accompanying paper (40Raman R. Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Pojasek K. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12167-12174Google Scholar).Second, the observed NaCl titration profile (Fig. 4B) demonstrates a clearly inhibitory effect of ionic strength on sulfatase activity, even at relatively low NaCl concentrations. In other words, whereas 507 inhibition occurred in the presence of ∼200 mm NaCl, even 100 mm NaCl was slightly inhibitory to 2-O-sulfatase activity. We have likewise noted this rather sharp activity transition for both the Δ4,5-glycuronidase and other recombinantly expressed F. heparinum GAG-degrading enzymes. This correlation between activity and the ionic buffer composition is not surprising, given the anionic character of the saccharide substrates conferred by both the presence of sulfates and the uronic acid carboxylates within each disaccharide unit. For the 2-O-sulfatase in particular, charge interactions between basic side chains and the sulfate oxygen anion would be clearly important for substrate orientation. Additional interactions with the uronic acid C-5 carboxylate are also likely to occur. A masking of these important charges by exogenous ions would logically interfere with their catalytic function.The flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase also possesses 52 acidic amino acids, at least three of which are highly conserved (e.g. Asp-42, Asp-63, and Asp-295). Four acidic side chains are also found in a consensus active site derived from known crystal structures. In this snapshot, these four carboxylates appear to coordinate a divalent metal ion (typically calcium). We could find no empirical evidence, however, for the requirement of divalent metal ions for maximal sulfatase activity. The enzyme was largely unaffected by either a preincubation with EDTA (up to 5 mm) or the addition of Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+. We were somewhat surprised by this in vitro observation given the structural inference of a common metal binding site and a report in the literature describing inactivation of the glucuronate-2-sulfatase with EDTA (35Freeman C. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 399-405Google Scholar). Whereas this may be so, not all sulfatases described to date have been shown in fact to be inactivated by EDTA. The issue of metal ion chelation is discussed in greater detail in the paper that follows (40Raman R. Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Pojasek K. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12167-12174Google Scholar).As stated earlier, the recombinant flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase acted on every unsaturated heparin disaccharide examined, provided each saccharide possessed a 2-O-sulfated uronic acid at its nonreducing end. We were particularly interested, however, in ascertaining any kinetic discrimination the enzyme may possess for its substrates based on additional structural considerations, namely the number and position of sulfates on the adjoining hexosamine, glycosidic linkage position (i.e. ॆ1→4 versus α1→3) and the 2-OH-position of the anomeric carbon within this hexosamine (i.e. glucosamine versus galactosamine). For the 2-O-sulfated, unsaturated heparin disaccharides examined, the enzyme exhibited kcat andKm values roughly in the range of 600–1700 s−1 and 0.1–1 mm, respectively. Both of these parameters generally agree with values described in earlier studies using the sulfatase directly purified from flavobacterial lysates. In directly comparing the four heparin disaccharide substrates tested, however, we noted a clear kinetic discrimination exhibited by the recombinant enzyme; one based on the extent of sulfation and largely manifested as a Km effect. In particular, it appears that substrate binding is most favorably conferred by the presence of a sulfate at the 6-OH-position of the adjoining glucosamine. Sulfation of the amine likewise confers a positive effect, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree relative to the 6-OH-position.Interestingly, the 2-O-sulfatase was also able to desulfate unsaturated chondroitin disaccharides at the 2-OH-position. The recombinant enzyme is, therefore, both a heparin/heparan and chondroitin 2-O-sulfatase. Compared with the corresponding heparin substrate, the rate of hydrolysis was markedly slower, however (Fig. 5B). This result indicates that whereas linkage position and/or hexosamine isomerization are discriminating kinetic factors, these physical parameters are not absolute determinants for 2-O-sulfatase substrate recognition. It is interesting to consider this latter observation in the context of the lysosomal pathway for glycosaminoglycan degradation in mammals where one enzyme desulfates both chondroitin and HS oligosaccharides at this position.In our studies, we exclusively used unsaturated saccharide substrates on the presumption that they are the naturally occurring substratein vivo. If the 2-O-sulfatase ordinarily acts on heparinase-derived saccharides in a sequential HSGAG degradation pathway, we can also place the activity of the 2-O-sulfatase 舠upstream舡 from the hydrolysis of the unsaturated uronic acid by the Δ4,5-glycuronidase. The obligatory substrate-product relationship between the 2-O-sulfatase and the Δ4,5-glycuronidase has been described by our laboratory (1Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Google Scholar) and others (36Dietrich C.P. Silva M.E. Michelacci Y.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6408-6415Google Scholar). In this paper, we further demonstrate this correlation in two experiments summarized in Figs. 6 and 7. Fig. 7 also illustrates how these two enzymes (along with the heparinases) can be used in tandem as analytical tools for HSGAG compositional analyses.As we pointed out earlier, there are 2-O-sulfatases present in the mammalian glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway. Whereas both of these enzymes desulfate heparan sulfate, the iduronate-2-sulfate sulfatase also acts on dermatan sulfate. Both enzymes possess an acidic pH optimum for activity, a fact consistent with their location within the lysosome. The two sulfatases initially exist as precursors that must be proteolytically processed for activity. The native molecular mass of the human iduronate-2-sulfate sulfatase precursor has been reported in the range of 42–65 kDa (32Bielicki J. Freeman C. Clements P.R. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 75-86Google Scholar), whereas its theoretical mass based entirely on its amino acid composition is ∼62 kDa. As such, the mammalian lysosomal iduronate-2-sulfate sulfatase is somewhat larger than its flavobacterial counterpart, while also requiring substantial posttranslational modification for maximal enzyme activity. The acidic pH optima for the lysosomal enzymes would also appear to limit their in vitro use for the determination of HSGAG composition, at least when used in tandem with other flavobacterial HSGAG-degrading enzymes such as the heparinases or the Δ4,5-glycuronidase; these latter enzymes all possess a pH optimum much closer to neutrality.The obvious fact that we are able to measure robust, 2-O-specific sulfatase activity for the recombinantly expressed enzyme argues, at least from a functional perspective, for the presence of the critical catalytic formylglycine within the sulfatase active site. This functionality clearly validates our use ofE. coli as a recombinant expression system for the large scale production of active enzyme. Our results also logically point to the existence of the necessary sulfatase-modifying enzyme(s) encoded by the E. coli genome. The heterologous expression of other catalytically active sulfatases in E. coli has been reported (34Boltes I. Czapinska H. Kahnert A. von Bulow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 483-491Google Scholar, 37Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Google Scholar). One notable exception of which we are aware is the mucin-desulfating enzyme from Prevotella sp. (38Wright D.P. Knight C.G. Parkar S.G. Christie D.L. Roberton A.M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3002-3007Google Scholar). Interestingly, this particular desulfating enzyme possesses a modified serine rather than a cysteine within its active site, a fact supported by our own multiple sequence alignment (see Fig. 1 in the accompanying paper (40Raman R. Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Pojasek K. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12167-12174Google Scholar)). To the best of our knowledge, nearly every active, recombinantly expressed sulfatase reported in the literature possesses a cysteine (and not a serine) within the active site sequence (C/S)XPXRXXXX(S/T)G. It seems likely, therefore, that a cysteine-specific modifying machinery functionally exists in E. coli. Our initial attempts to produce a recombinant cysteine → serine 2-O-sulfatase variant led to the production of insoluble protein when expressed in E. coli. Consequently, we are currently unable to empirically address this hypothesis using the 2-O-sulfatase as a prototype. We point out the curious fact that the E. coli genome encodes for at least three different putative sulfatase genes, in addition to the atsB gene, which, by homology, has been proposed to encode for this cysteine-specific modifying activity. All of these genes are located as a cluster within the bacterial chromosome (39Kertesz M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 135-175Google Scholar). It would appear, however, that the E. coli sulfatase genes are normally cryptic. At the very least, E. coli lacks the specific enzymes for desulfating heparin/heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. In any case, the bacterium fortuitously provides the necessary enzymology to effectively modify select heterologous sulfatases such as the 2-O-sulfatase. We look forward to the use of this facile expression system to recombinantly express other flavobacterial glycosaminoglycan sulfatases as their respective genes are identified. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and the related heparan sulfate (HSGAGs)1 are complex, linear carbohydrates possessing considerable chemical heterogeneity (2Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar, 3Shriver Z. Liu D. Sasisekharan R. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 71-77Google Scholar). Their structural diversity is largely a consequence of the variable number and position of sulfates present within a single HSGAG chain. Because of their highly anionic character, these polysaccharides historically have been relegated to an exclusively structural role, namely as a sort of hydration gel and scaffold comprising the extracellular matrix. Contrary to this limited perception, however, HSGAGs actually play an important and dynamic function in many critical biological processes ranging from development (4Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar) and tissue repair (5Simeon A. Wegrowski Y. Bontemps Y. Maquart F.X. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 115: 962-968Google Scholar) to apoptosis (6Ishikawa Y. Kitamura M. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 954-963Google Scholar, 7Kapila Y.L. Wang S. Dazin P. Tafolla E. Mass M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8482-8491Google Scholar). These polysaccharides are also central players in several pathological conditions such as cancer (8Selva E.M. Perrimon N. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 67-80Google Scholar, 9Sasisekharan R. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Narayanasami U. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 521-528Google Scholar), angiogenesis (10Folkman J. Shing Y. Adv. Exp. Med."

Moco consists of molybdopterin, an alkylated, not fully aromatic pterin, complexing one molybdenum atom via a dithiolene group to its four-carbon side chain. It occurs in several dihydroforms, depending on the enzyme, that facilitate the oxidation-reduction reaction (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, the cofactor can be modified by an additional nucleotide monophosphate bound to the C-4′ of the phosphate group within the alkylic side chain of the pterin (2Mendel R.R. Hänsch R. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1689-1698Google Scholar, 3Johnson J.L. Bastian N.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1390-1394Google Scholar). Molybdoenzymes are widespread and essential for diverse metabolic processes such as the first step of nitrate assimilation in autotrophs, sulfur detoxification and purine catabolism in mammals, and phytohormone synthesis in plants (4Hinton S.M. Dean D. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 17: 169-188Google Scholar, 5Hoff T. Truong H.-N. Caboche M. Plant Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 489-506Google Scholar, 6Walker-Simmons M. Kudrna D.A. Warner R.L. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 728-733Google Scholar). Thus the survival of many living organisms depends on their ability to synthesize Moco and to maintain it in a preserved active form. Several diseases have been related to a defect in Moco synthesis (7Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Beauder A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2271-2283Google Scholar). Among the diverse organisms studied, at least six gene products are involved in the formation of active Moco (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Google Scholar, 2Mendel R.R. Hänsch R. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1689-1698Google Scholar). Moco biosynthesis occurs by a multistep reaction of molybdopterin synthesis followed by the incorporation of molybdenum (2Mendel R.R. Hänsch R. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1689-1698Google Scholar). Moco activity is routinely assayed by measuring the reconstituted nitrate reductase activity from the inactive apoenzyme of theNeurospora crassa fungal mutant strain nit1, which lacks active Moco (8Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. De Vries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3242-3246Google Scholar). This cofactor is very unstable in vitro, and molybdenum readily dissociates from the cofactor complex, converting irreversibly into an inactive form such that molybdate stabilizes Moco (9Mendel R.R. Alikulov Z.A. L'vov N.O. Müller A.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 181: 395-399Google Scholar, 10Mendel R.R. Buchanan R.J. Wray J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 186-189Google Scholar). Other sulfhydryl-protecting agents stabilize Moco (10Mendel R.R. Buchanan R.J. Wray J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 186-189Google Scholar, 11Mendel R.R. Phytochemistry. 1983; 22: 817-819Google Scholar), whereas sulfhydryl-reactive inhibitors prevent the reconstituting activity of the cofactor (12Alikulov Z.A. Mendel R.R. Biochem. Physiol. Pflanz. 1984; 179: 693-705Google Scholar), indicating the participation of free sulfhydryl groups in the reconstitution process. Oxygen seems to be a major factor of free Moco inactivation, which might be especially dramatic in autotrophs because of the photosynthetic activity. Thus the presence of a stabilizing agent in vivo appears to be essential. Information on the storage of active Moco in the cells is scarce. In a previous study (13Witte C.P. Igeño M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Google Scholar), we purified a Moco-binding protein fromChlamydomonas reinhardtii. It was named molybdenum cofactor carrier protein (MocoCP) because of its ability to transfer Moco directly to aponitrate reductase (14Aguilar M. Kalakoutskii K. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 162-163Google Scholar). This 64-kDa MocoCP with four identical subunits of 16.5 kDa protected Moco against inactivation under aerobic conditions and basic pH levels. Proteins with similar characteristics were also found in Vicia faba(15Kalakoutskii K. Fernández E. Planta. 1996; 201: 64-70Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli (16Amy N.K. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 114-124Google Scholar). In this work, we present the first molecular evidence for the presence of a MocoCP in eukaryotes. The recombinant MocoCP binds Moco with a high affinity and stabilizes Moco against in vitroinactivation by oxygen. C. reinhardtiiwild type has been characterized elsewhere (17Fernández E. Cárdenas J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 164-169Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 25 °C under continuous illumination in a liquid minimal medium that contained 4 mm KNO3 as a nitrogen source bubbled with 4% (v/v) CO2-enriched air (18Harris E. The Chlamydomonas Source Book. Academic Press, New York1989Google Scholar). N. crassa nit1 mutant (Fungal Genetic Stock Center, Arcata, CA) was grown in an ammonium-containing medium and induced in 20 mm nitrate under previously reported conditions (19Garrett R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 264: 481-489Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, all E. coli strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, or both. Where appropriate, E. coli strains LE392 and BM25.5 were used for library screening and automatic subcloning, respectively. Further subcloning of cDNA or genomic DNAs was performed using E. coli strains DH5αF′ or XL1 blue. Expression of recombinant MocoCP was carried out in the E. coli strain M-15. MocoCP was purified as reported previously (13Witte C.P. Igeño M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Google Scholar) and subjected to a porous SDS-PAGE (20Doucet J.P. Trifaró J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 168: 265-271Google Scholar). The protein was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stain (0.25% w/v). The amino-terminal sequence was generated from the protein band cut from the dry blot. MocoCP was digested with CNBr after gel electrophoresis (21Plaxton C. Moorhead G. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 391-393Google Scholar). The equilibrated gel pieces were subjected to a second electrophoresis using Tricine-SDS-PAGE (22Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). The separated peptides were blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and processed like the amino-terminal blotted protein. Sequencing was carried out at the Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung (GBF, Braunschweig, Germany) on a gas-phase sequencing apparatus. Two sequences were obtained for peptides from CNBr digestion: GPGKADTAENQLVMANELGKQIATHG and MGPGTAAEVALALKAKKPVVL. Two degenerated primers corresponding to PGKADTAE and MGPGTAAEVA were designed from the microsequenced protein of purified C. reinhardtii MocoCP by employing the deduced codon usage for C. reinhardtii genes. These primers are named MOP1 (forward, 5′-CCCGGCAAGGCCGACCANGCNGAR-3′) and MOP2 (reverse, 5′-GCCACCTCGGCGGCGGTNCCNGGNCCCAT-3′), respectively, where N is any of the four nucleotides and R corresponds to A or G. These primers were used in reverse transcription PCR for amplification of a MocoCP cDNA fragment. On the other hand, new primers were designed for amplifying the complete coding region of the MocoCP gene for expression in E. coli. New restriction sites for XbaI andXhoI were included in the forward (MF1, 5′-TCTAGACATGTCGGGACGCAAGCCCATT-3′) and reverse (MR1, 5′-CTCGAGCTACGCCAGCAGCTGCTTGAC-3′) primers, respectively, to facilitate further subcloning in the expression vector. The sense primer contained the start codon in frame with that of glutathioneS-transferase, and the antisense primer contained the stop codon. cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA extracted from the wild type 21gr of C. reinhardtiicultivated in 4 mm nitrate by reverse transcription amplification using the SuperscriptTM II kit (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription PCR was performed withTaq DNA polymerase (BioTools B&M Laboratories) in reactions containing 2.5% Me2SO, as recommended by the manufacturer, with the following cycling conditions: 96 °C for 1 min, then 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The selected PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM®-T vector (Promega). TheC. reinhardtii cDNA library in λEXlox(kindly provided by Dr. Paul Lefebvre, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN) was propagated and blotted onto nylon filters. Subsequent hybridization was performed (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a DNA probe randomly labeled by digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and positive signals were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antidigoxigenin antibodies and the chemoluminescent substrate CDP-StarTM. The genomic library in λEMBL4 containing approximate insert sizes of 14 kb (kindly provided by Dr. Carolyn Silflow, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN) was screened, similar to the cDNA library, by using the MocoCP cDNA as a probe. The inserts were released byEcoRI digestions and cloned into the pBluescript KS (+/−). DNA was sequenced using a dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit on an ABI Prism 373 cycle sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA sequencing was performed using primers determined by the vector (T3, T7, SP6, forward or reverse). The nucleotide sequences were determined in both directions and analyzed using the GCG (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) and DNASTAR programs. The deduced amino acid sequence was compared with sequences obtained from searches in the NCBI Protein Database using the BLASTP algorithm (24Altschul S.F. Gish A. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences were aligned and converted to a phylogenetic tree using MegAlign of the DNASTAR package. Active Moco was assayed indirectly by determining the reconstituted NR activity from extracts of theN. crassa nit1 mutant as described previously (8Nason A. Lee K.Y. Pan S.S. Ketchum P.A. Lamberti A. De Vries J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 3242-3246Google Scholar). The extract was prepared as reported previously and frozen at −80 °C until use (13Witte C.P. Igeño M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Google Scholar). Moco was released from 250× diluted buttermilk Grade II (Sigma) XO (EC 1.1.3.22) by heat treatment at 80 °C for 2 min. The active Moco was determined by reconstitution of the NR activity (14Aguilar M. Kalakoutskii K. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 162-163Google Scholar) after the addition of 1 μl of Moco (in 30 μl total volume) with or without MocoCP to the apoNR of N. crassa (60 μl). Then reconstituted NR activity was assayed as reported (25Paneque A. Losada M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 202-204Google Scholar) by measuring the amount of nitrite produced (26Snell F.D. Snell C.T. Snell F.D. Snell C.T. Colorimetric Methods of Analysis. 2. Van Nostrand, New York1949: 802-807Google Scholar). One unit of active Moco or MocoCP was defined as the amount of Moco, either free or bound to MocoCP, that yields one unit of reconstituted NR activity expressed as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of 1 μmol of nitrate/min. Moco binding experiments were performed using Moco extracted from 250× diluted milk XO as described previously (10Mendel R.R. Buchanan R.J. Wray J.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 186-189Google Scholar). Freshly isolated Moco (1 μl) was incubated with 0.75 μg of MocoCP for a defined time at room temperature. Protein-bound and unbound Moco was separated by gel filtration chromatography with Sephadex G-25 spin columns (BioRad), and aliquot volumes of the high and low molecular weight fractions were used for the Nit1 reconstitution assay. Using insertion mutagenesis PCR, two restriction sites,XbaI and XhoI, were added to the amplified coding region of the MocoCP cDNA (495 bp). This DNA was subcloned into pGEM®-T. The insert fragment was released by digestion withXbaI/XhoI and subcloned in the expression vector pGEX-KG (27Guan K. Dixon J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar) in E. coli M-15. The cells from 1-liter cultures in 2YT medium (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 25 μg/ml kanamycin were collected by centrifugation at an optical density of 1 unit at 600 nm. The cells were washed, resuspended in 2YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and 200 mm IPTG, and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of the PBST extraction buffer (10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed by ultrasonication, and the bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove the cell debris. The clear crude extract was applied onto a GSH-agarose column (0.5 × 3 cm) equilibrated with the same extraction buffer. After washing the matrix with PBST, the fusion protein was eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm GSH. The eluted fraction was concentrated by centrifugation in Centricon (Millipore) and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. 50 units of thrombin were added for 4 h at room temperature to digest the link between GST and MocoCP. The digested protein was applied onto a minicolumn of Sephadex G-25 to eliminate GSH, and the high molecular weight fraction was subject to rechromatography in GSH-agarose. The eluted fractions contained the MocoCP. The purity of the protein was judged from SDS-PAGE (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) with 15% separation gel after visualizing the protein bands with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass was calculated from migrations of molecular weight markers (Sigma). The concentrations of the purified protein were determined from the UV light absorption at 280 nm corresponding to the single tryptophan residue of MocoCP (ε = 5.6m−1 cm−1). A cDNA fragment of 300 bp was amplified by reverse transcription PCR using the primers MOP1 and MOP2. They were designed from protein microsequencing of purified MocoCP from C. reinhardtii and its CNBr digestion peptides. The DNA sequence of this cDNA fragment included both of the primers used and additional amino acid residues present in the original protein microsequencing, which indicated that the correct fragment had been amplified. This 300-bp fragment was used as a probe to screen a cDNA library from C. reinhardtii 21gr cells grown in nitrate medium. From about 80,000 phages screened, 7 hybridizing phages were identified, recovered, and subcloned into the pEXlox vector. The cloned plasmids released inserts of 0.8–1.0 kb after EcoRI and HindIII digestions. The cDNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 495 nucleotides encoding a protein of 165 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 16.5 kDa. The cDNA also defined 45 nucleotides at the 5′-untranslated region and 446 at the 3′-untranslated region, which has two possible noncanonical and overlapping polyadenylation signals, TGTCAGTAA (Fig.1), as compared with the typical signal in Chlamydomonas, and TGTAA (29Silflow C.D. Rochaix J.-D. Merchant S. Goldschmidt- Clermont M. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 25-40Google Scholar). A similar situation of contiguous noncanonical polyadenylation signals was found in theC. reinhardtii Nar1 gene (30Rexach J. Fernández E. Galván A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1441-1453Google Scholar). The full-length MocoCP cDNA was used as a probe to screen about 60,000 phages from a genomic library in λEMBL4. Nine clones with the highest signals were chosen for further study. These phages corresponding to the C. reinhardtii MocoCP gene (CrMcp1) released inserts with an average length of 5–12 kb by EcoRI digestion as indicated by Southern blot analysis. One of these fragments of about 6 kb was cloned in Bluescript KS (+/−) and sequenced. The DNA sequencing of the genomic clone revealed an open reading frame of 495 nucleotides similar to that of MocoCP cDNA, which is divided into 4 exons (capital letters) separated by 3 introns (lowercase letters). The introns are defined by the typical splicing sites in C. reinhardtii, 5′,G-gt(g/a)(a/g)g and 3′, (c/t)ag-(A/G/C), (29Silflow C.D. Rochaix J.-D. Merchant S. Goldschmidt- Clermont M. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplast and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 25-40Google Scholar). The promoter region (Fig. 1) would cover 600 bp with a putative TATA box (position −240 from the beginning of the cDNA), two nitrate-dependent transcription motifs (positions −184 and −113) corresponding to an AT-rich sequence followed by (G/A)(C/G)TCA (31Hwang C.F. Lin Y. D'Souza T. Cheng C.L. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 853-862Google Scholar), and 10 possible boxes related to light control and described in plants (sphinx.rug.ac.be:8080/PlantCARE/cgi/index.html). TheCrMcp1 gene shows the usual features of C. reinhardtii genes, such as the presence of many introns despite the small size of the coding region, a long 3′-untranslated region, and particular polyadenylation sequences. The comparison of the deduced MocoCP amino acid sequence with sequences from the GenBankTM showed similarity to proteins with unknown functions. The sequences with the highest conservation were from bacteria and Archaea (Fig.2 A). The maximum similarity of 49.7% was found with a putative protein from the cyanobacteriumTrichodesmium erythraeum (GenBankTMaccession number ZP_00073012). Moderate identities were also found with a putative protein deduced from Aquifex aeolicus (31.1%, GenBankTM accession number AAC06500) and with predicted Rossmann fold nucleotide-binding proteins from ArchaeaMethanopyrus kandleri (33.1%, GenBankTMaccession number NP_614673) and Crenarchaeota 74A4 (27.9%, GenBankTM accession number AAK96093). A limited and insignificant identity was found with protein sequences from plants in the GenBankTM data base. The phylogenetic tree of the examined proteins (Fig. 2 B) shows that the cyanobacterial protein is grouped together with the C. reinhardtii MocoCP, both of which are at a similar distance from the proteins from M. kandleri and A. aeolicus, all of which are more distantly related to the protein from the Crenarchaeota sp. Although no protein from plants showed conservation with MocoCP, it is interesting to point out that there is a protein with functionality of the Moco carrier in V. faba (15Kalakoutskii K. Fernández E. Planta. 1996; 201: 64-70Google Scholar). The molecular analysis of the 165-amino acid sequence of MocoCP using the program PROTEAN showed that this protein is highly hydrophobic. The calculated pI of 6.1 is higher than that of 4.5 determined experimentally for native MocoCP purified from C. reinhardtii (13Witte C.P. Igeño M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Google Scholar). This difference could be due to the tetrameric form of the native protein, which may affect the net charge of the whole molecule. All examined molybdoenzymes, such as NR from various sources (32Garde J. Kinghorn J.R. Tomsett A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6644-6650Google Scholar, 33Su W. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Google Scholar), sulfite oxidase of rat liver (34Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 272-276Google Scholar, 35Garrett R.M. Bellissimo D.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 147-149Google Scholar), XO, and aldehyde oxidase (36Wootton J.C. Nicholson R.E. Cock J.M. Walter D.E. Burke J.F. Doyle W.A. Bray R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 157-185Google Scholar), showed an invariant Moco-binding site in the Moco domain with the characteristic signature sequence CAGNRR. This sequence is suggested to be involved in Moco binding, and a mutation in the C residue completely abolishes the NR and sulfite oxidase activity of Pichia (33Su W. Mertens J.A. Kanamaru K. Campbell W.H. Crawford N.M. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1135-1143Google Scholar, 37Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Google Scholar). However, the MocoCP-deduced amino acid sequence does not contain any C residue nor, subsequently, does it contain the signature sequence CAGNRR. Thus, the Moco-binding site in MocoCP seems to differ from that in the Moco domain of molybdoenzymes by allowing both efficient binding and release of Moco. Southern blot analysis of digested genomic DNA from the C. reinhardtii wild type 6145c using the cDNA as a probe showed hybridization bands compatible with a singleCrMcp1 gene copy (data not shown). Little is known about the regulation of Moco genes in eukaryotes. In plants, Moco gene expression was found to be extremely low so that standard Northern blots hardly give signals. As expected for housekeeping genes, Moco genes are expressed constitutively at a basal level (38Mendel R.R. Schwarz G. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1999; 18: 33-69Google Scholar). The CrMcp1 gene seems to belong to this family of genes, as it barely gave a signal using standard Northern blots (data not shown). The availability of sufficient amounts of Moco in a constitutive form is essential for the cell to meet its changing demand for synthesizing particular enzymes. The multistep synthesis of Moco and the low expression together with the instability of synthesized Moco suggest that the existence of Moco storage proteins would be a good means by which to buffer the supply and demand of Moco. In this respect, Chlamydomonas cells contain a much larger amount of Moco bound to MocoCP than bound to NR (39Llamas A. Kalakoutskii K.L. Fernández E. Plant Cell Environ. 2000; 23: 1247-1255Google Scholar). The MocoCP from C. reinhardtii was expressed in E. coli that had been transformed with the expression vector pGEX, which contained the full coding region of MocoCP. Purification of the GST-MocoCP fusion protein had been performed by specific elution with glutathione in a GSH-agarose affinity chromatography. After digestion with thrombin, GST and MocoCP were separated by rechromatography on the same affinity column. MocoCP eluted directly in the flowing fractions and showed a high homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). The recombinant MocoCP showed a molecular mass higher than that of the predicted protein (16.5 kDa) given that digestion by thrombin leaves 14 amino acids from the linker region of the fusion protein (GSPGISGGGGGILD). This glycine-rich linker facilitates the proteolytic digestion by thrombin (27Guan K. Dixon J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar). As shown below, the recombinant MocoCP has a high binding affinity to Moco and transfers Moco efficiently to the apoenzyme from N. crassanit1 extracts, indicating that this linker did not affect the function of MocoCP. In C. reinhardtii, Moco exists in two main forms, bound to MocoCP and bound to molybdoenzymes, as free Moco is hardly detectable (40Aguilar M. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1073: 463-469Google Scholar). Moco bound to MocoCP in C. reinhardtii is unable to reconstitute the NR activity of the N. crassa nit1 mutant when separated by a dialysis membrane, whereas free Moco extracted from XO can achieve reconstitution. A direct contact between the MocoCP charged with Moco and the apoNR of N. crassa was proposed for the reconstitution of the enzyme activity (13Witte C.P. Igeño M.I. Mendel R. Schwarz G. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 205-209Google Scholar, 14Aguilar M. Kalakoutskii K. Cárdenas J. Fernández E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 162-163Google Scholar). Recombinant MocoCP was subjected to molecular exclusion chromatography under native conditions. MocoCP behaved as a protein with a 70-kDa global molecular mass, which corresponded to a tetramer, whereas the fusion protein GST-MocoCP appeared to assemble into dimers of 90 kDa and multimers of more than 280 kDa (data not shown). In the absence of added Moco, both recombinant MocoCP and MocoCP bound to GST did not contain bound Moco as determined by the Nit1 reconstitution assay (Table I). However, after incubation with Moco from milk XO, recombinant MocoCP bound Moco but not the MocoCP-GST fusion protein. These data indicate that Moco is not required for the assembly of subunits in the quaternary structure of MocoCP and that GST interferes with the appropriate folding of MocoCP to bind Moco.Table IMoco binding activity of recombinant MocoCP from C. reinhardtiiSampleMoco activity in the excluded fractionMoco activity in the included fraction%%GST-MocoCPNDNDMocoCPNDNDGST-MocoCP + Moco2 ± 395 ± 3MocoCP + Moco98 ± 55 ± 4Recombinant MocoCP bound to GST (1 μg) or purified after thrombin digestion (0.75 μg) was incubated with Moco from milk XO.

Free Moco was released from milk XO by heat treatment under anaerobic conditions, and its binding to recombinant MocoCP was determined at different time intervals under aerobic conditions after filtering the binding mixtures through a spin column. Both free Moco and Moco bound to MocoCP were determined in the included and excluded fractions, respectively. Interestingly, recombinant MocoCP was able to bind free Moco from XO almost instantaneously (Table II). Thus recombinant MocoCP shows an extremely high affinity to bind free Moco from XO.Table IIEfficiency of recombinant MocoCP to bind Moco extracted from milk XOSampleIncubation timeExcluded fractionIncluded fractionmin%%Free Moco00100Free Moco + MocoCP095 ± 34 ± 1Free Moco + MocoCP594 ± 52 ± 1Free Moco + MocoCP1098 ± 43 ± 1Purified recombinant MocoCP (0.75 μg) was mixed with Moco extracted from milk XO.

Open table in a new tab Purified recombinant MocoCP (0.75 μg) was mixed with Moco extracted from milk XO.

As a control, the same filtration was performed without adding MocoCP. 100% Moco activity corresponds to 0.41 units/ml. Recombinant MocoCP protected Moco against inactivation by oxygen. When bound to recombinant MocoCP, Moco was stabilized against this inactivation. Free Moco had lost its activity after 5 h of incubation in aerobic conditions (Fig.4), whereas Moco bound to recombinant MocoCP was still more than 93% active under the same conditions. Even after 72 h in the presence of oxygen, MocoCP conserved 30% of its Moco activity (Fig. 4). In photosynthetic organisms, large amounts of oxygen are produced during photosynthesis. This oxygen would inactivate intracellular free Moco, if present. In C. reinhardtii, the presence of many light-controlled sites in the promoter ofCrMcp1 would ensure a harmonious induction of this protein with the production of photosynthetic oxygen. The high affinity binding of Moco, the low concentration of free Moco, and the necessary contact of MocoCP and apoNR to transfer Moco (39Llamas A. Kalakoutskii K.L. Fernández E. Plant Cell Environ. 2000; 23: 1247-1255Google Scholar) together suggest that MocoCP functions as a binding, storage, protective, and carrier protein. As with all cellular biomolecules, molybdoenzymes degrade through normal protein turnover after achieving their catalytic function. There is no information about the fate of Moco. The low level of Moco biosynthesis and the high binding affinity of the MocoCP also suggest a role for MocoCP in the recycling of Moco. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of MocoCP in living organisms. The isolation of the cDNA and genomic DNA for the C. reinhardtii MocoCP provides a definitive molecular support for the existence of this protein in eukaryotes. TheCrMcp1 gene encodes a protein that contains the sequence of peptides microsequenced from purified C. reinhardtii MocoCP. In addition, the protein expressed from cDNA constructs inE. coli is functionally active and demonstrates the properties of Moco binding and Moco protection shown for the protein in the alga. Proteins related to MocoCP from C. reinhardtiiappear to be present in cyanobacteria and other bacteria, although a clear sequence conservation does not appear to exist with other eukaryotic proteins. Our data show that, inChlamydomonas, Mcp1 encodes MocoCP, a homotetrameric protein that binds Moco with a high affinity and plays a key role in the maintenance and storage of Moco in an active form under aerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1983770773,"In the present report we describe the properties of a novel phospho-specific antiserum that has opened a route to the characterization of antigen receptor-activated serine kinase pathways in lymphocytes. The basis for the present work was that Ser-21 in glycogen synthase kinase 3α is robustly phosphorylated following antigen receptor triggering. We predicted accordingly that antigen receptors would also stimulate phosphorylation of other proteins with a similar sequence. To test this idea we raised an antibody against the phospho-peptide RARTSpSFAEP, where pS is a phospho-serine corresponding to the glycogen synthase kinase 3α Ser-21 sequence. The resulting antiserum was called phospho antibody for proteomics-1 (PAP-1). The present study describes the properties of PAP-1 and shows that it can reveal quite striking differences in the phospho-proteome of different cell types and is able to pinpoint new targets in important signal transduction pathways. PAP-1 was used to map protein phosphorylations regulated by the antigen receptor in T cells. One of these PAP-1-reactive proteins was purified and revealed to be a previously unrecognized target for antigen receptor signal transduction, namely an “orphan” adapter SLY (Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein expressed in lymphocytes). The use of sera detecting specific phosphorylation sites is thus proved as a powerful method for the discovery of novel downstream components of antigen receptor signals in T cells.

An immediate consequence of triggering the TCR is activation of cytosolic protein-tyrosine kinases of the Src, Syk, and Tec families (1Acuto O. Cantrell D.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 165-184Google Scholar). These tyrosine kinases phosphorylate an array of adapter molecules that initiate a cascade of signaling pathways (2Samelson L.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 371-394Google Scholar, 3Koretzky G.A. Myung P.S. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 95-107Google Scholar). The key events are the activation of Ras and Rho family GTPase signaling networks and the metabolism of inositol phospholipids, which regulate both intracellular calcium and the activity of diverse serine/threonine kinases. The serine kinases triggered by antigen receptors include members of the protein kinase C (PKC) and D (PKD) kinase family, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-controlled serine kinases such as protein kinase B (PKB) and the Raf-1/Mek/Erk1,2/Rsk kinase cascades (4Cantrell D.A.

The action of antigen receptor-regulated serine kinases is essential for T cell activation, but there is little information about their substrates in T cells that can explain their actions. Some progress in understanding this action may be gained by looking for the existence of evolutionarily conserved serine kinase pathways in T cells. For example, Erk1/2 phosphorylation of the ternary complex transcription factors Elk1 (11Genot E. Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D.A.

However, such an approach ignores the possibility that ubiquitous kinases might have unique T cell-restricted substrates. Lack of knowledge about serine kinase substrates is a bioinformatic problem common in many cell systems. Phospho-amino acid analysis of the proteome shows that serine phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational events. However, reliable identification of serine kinase targets in intact cells has proved problematic and is a major rate-limiting step in furthering our knowledge and understanding of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells.In the last 10 years, some useful biochemical and genetic techniques have been developed to search for the downstream targets of serine kinases. These are largely based on the use of purified serine kinases to find substrates in cell lysates (16Knebel A. Morrice N. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4360-4369Google Scholar) or in cDNA expression library screening (17Fukunaga R. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1921-1933Google Scholar). Biochemical strategies require relatively pure serine kinase preparations of high specific activity and have the limitation that they examine the substrate specificity of a kinase free of any spatial restraints that might limit substrate availability in an intact cell. A recent breakthrough in the analysis of serine kinase networks came with the production of specific antisera against defined serine or threonine phosphorylated peptides that could then be used to map phosphorylation of known proteins as cells respond to external stimuli.A particular protein kinase will have a theoretical optimal substrate that is determined by its shape in relation to the reaction pocket of the kinase. Because this is partly determined by the local residues around the target serine, it has been possible to work out optimal amino acid sequences for protein kinases using in vitroassays of a degenerate peptide library. From this candidate, substrate sites of serine/threonine kinases have been identified and used to establish a protein data base motif-scanning program termed Scansite (18Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98Google Scholar, 19Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Lai J. Obata T. Volinia S. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 348-353Google Scholar, 20Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Google Scholar). There are thousands of potential serine/threonine kinase sites within the proteome, and it is still very difficult to predict and map pathways of serine phosphorylation by data base analysis alone.In vivo experimental data is still needed to narrow down potential targets to a reasonable level. In this context, one useful way to obtain biochemical data to facilitate computer-based searches for serine kinase targets is to use antibodies raised against phosphorylated peptide candidate sites (21Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar).The immunoreactivity of phospho-specific antisera is determined not only by the presence of a phosphorylated amino acid but also by the charges and hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties of surrounding amino acids. Phospho-specific antisera thus have the potential to cross-react with proteins that contain a phosphorylated peptide that is not necessarily identical in terms of linear sequence but that is structurally similar. The potential cross-reactivity associated with the use of phospho-specific antisera is a feature that can be exploited to delineate serine kinase networks in cells. In this context, antibodies reactive with phosphorylated PKB and PKC substrate sequences have been used recently to define new sites of serine phosphorylation in intact cells (21Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar, 22Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Google Scholar).The present study describes the properties of an antiserum termed PAP-1 (phospho antibody forproteomics-1) that recognizes a tier of proteins regulated by serine phosphorylation in activated cells. PAP-1 was raised against the phospho-peptide RARTSpSFAEP corresponding to Ser-21 in glycogen synthase kinase 3α, a known substrate for Akt/PKB. PAP-1 recognizes a subset of PKB substrates and can be used to identify novel components of PKB signaling. However, the immunoreactivity of PAP-1 is quite distinct to that of antisera raised against the PKB substrate sequence RXRXX pS/T. In T lymphocytes, the T cell antigen receptor is known to regulate the activity of diverse serine kinases, but analysis of the complex patterns of serine phosphorylation in activated T cells has been a laborious and slow process. In the present work, PAP-1 was used to map protein phosphorylations regulated by the antigen receptor in T cells. One of these PAP-1-reactive proteins was purified and revealed to be a previously unrecognized target for antigen receptor signal transduction, namely an “orphan” adapter SLY (Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing protein expressed in lymphocytes). PAP-1 is thus able to identify novel downstream components of antigen receptor signals in T cells.RESULTSA polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against the phospho-peptide RARTSpSFAEP, where pS is a phospho-serine corresponding to the GSK3α Ser-21 sequence. In initial experiments to explore the reactivity of the resultant antiserum PAP-1, we carried out Western blot analyses of cell lysates isolated from quiescent and pervanadate (PV)-activated T lymphocytes. Pervanadate is used to pharmacologically induce a potent stimulation of tyrosine kinases and their downstream effector pathways in lymphocytes and, hence, is a very useful tool for synchronously activating a broad range of serine kinases in these cells. PAP-1 recognized a single 160-kDa protein in the unstimulated T cells but was strongly reactive with a number of proteins across a wide molecular weight range isolated from pervanadate-activated cells (Fig.1 A). These have molecular masses of 50, 55, 75, 80, 85, 250, and 400 kDa, respectively. It is important to establish whether PAP-1 can recognize proteins phosphorylated in response to physiologically relevant stimuli, and, hence, the immunoreactivity of PAP-1 with T cell lysates isolated from antigen receptor activated T cells was examined. PAP-1 was strongly reactive with several proteins in cell lysates isolated from stimulated but not quiescent cells; the predominant proteins recognized by PAP-1 in TCR-activated cells were those with molecular masses of 50, 55, 85, and 250 kDa (Fig. 1 B).The phospho-peptide immunogen used to generate PAP-1 was based around Ser-21 in GSK3α. The p50 protein recognized by PAP-1 in activated T cells co-migrates on SDS-PAGE gels with GSK3α, and its identity as GSK3α was confirmed by its co-elution during protein purification on heparin-Sepharose and Mono Q columns (see below). The identity of the other proteins recognized by the antiserum was unknown. Ser-21 in GSK3α is a substrate for PKB (27Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Google Scholar). However, the immunoreactivity of PAP-1 with these additional proteins was competed by the immunizing phospho-peptide phospho-Ser-21 GSK3α (RARTSpSFAEP) and not by other phosphorylated PKB substrate peptides, phospho-Ser-256 FKHR (RRRAApSMONN) (28Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar) or phospho-Thr-23 IKKα (RERLGpTGGFG) (29Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Google Scholar).A commercial antiserum that recognizes phosphorylated FKHR serine 256 is available. This antiserum recognized a single protein of 97 kDa in quiescent T cells and two proteins of 85 and 97kDa in antigen receptor-activated T cells (Fig.2 B, middle panel). These did not co-migrate with any of the PAP-1-reactive proteins. Moreover, the immunoreactivity of the phospho-Ser-256 FKHR antiserum was competed by the phospho-Ser-256 FKHR peptide but not the PAP-1-immunizing phospho-peptide or the phospho-Thr-23 IKKα peptide. The phospho-peptide competitions show that phospho-antisera are highly selective and indicate that PAP-1 reacted with proteins that contain a sequence structurally similar to GSK3α, Ser-21.Figure 2Comparison of PAP-1 and PKB phospho-substrate antibody immunoreactivities in cells containing an inducible active PKB. RPE (retinal pigment epithelial) cells containing a tamoxifen-inducible active PKB (PKB-ER) were left unstimulated (0) or treated with either 100 ng/ml tamoxifen for 4 h (Tamox) or 50 ng/ml PDBu for 5 min. Whole cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using PKB phospho-substrate antibody (A) or PAP-1 (B) together with 10 μg/ml of one of the following oligopeptides as indicated: GSK 3α (RARTSSFAEP), P-Ser-21 GSK3α (RARTSpSFAEP), or P-ser256 FKHR (RRRAApSMONN).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The TCR regulates GSK3α serine phosphorylation via PI3K-dependant pathways (9Lafont V. Astoul E. Laurence A. Liautard J. Cantrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 38-42Google Scholar). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 prevents the PKB activation response seen in TCR-activated cells. It also suppresses activation of the MAPKs Erk1 and -2 (Fig. 1 C). TCR induction of the phosphorylation of GSK3α (PAP-1p50), PAP1 p55, p80/85, and p250 was inhibited by Ly294002. PAP-1-reactive proteins, like GSK3α, are regulated by PI3K pathways (Fig. 1 C).PAP-1: A Phospho-peptide-specific Antiserum That Recognizes a Subset of PKB SubstratesA critical question was whether the PAP-1 antiserum would be a pan PKB substrate antiserum with the potential to identify novel substrates for this kinase. Moreover, an interesting question was whether the PAP-1 phospho-map shown in activated T cells was unique or seen in other cell lineages. To probe this issue we analyzed PAP-1 immunoreactivity with a human epithelial cell line, RPE, which expressed a tamoxifen-inducible PKB mutant. In quiescent RPE cells there is low basal activity of PKB and some basal phosphorylation of GSK3α on Ser-21 (see Fig. 4 below). PKB activity is induced by tamoxifen treatment of the cells with a concomitant increase in GSK3α Ser-21 phosphorylation (30Mirza A.M. Kohn A.D. Roth R.A. McMahon M. Cell Growth & Differ. 2000; 11: 279-292Google Scholar). 2S. Basu, unpublished. Figure 4Purification of PAP-1 identified protein p55. A, cell lysates from activated T lymphocytes were chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose column. Absorbance at 280 nm is shown by the full line, and the elution NaCl gradient is shown by the broken line. 40-μg aliquots from each fraction from the heparin-Sepharose column were subjected to Western blot analysis. The lower panels show the Western blot analysis with PAP-1 of fractions 16–31 as well as the whole lysate before separation (Tot), the unbound fraction (Ub), and proteins collected during the washing of the column (Wsh). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-pan-GSK 3α/β. B, the heparin-Sepharose PAP1p55-rich fractions were pooled, desalted, and chromatographed on a Mono Q column. The absorbance at 280 nm is shown by the full line, and the elution NaCl gradient is shown by the broken line. Aliquots of 4 μg of protein from each fraction were prepared as above and Western blotted with PAP-1. C, the Mono Q fractions rich in PAP1p55 were desalted, acetone-precipitated, and run in duplicate using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. From each duplicate, one gel was treated for total protein content by silver staining (right panels), whereas the other was subjected to Western blotting with PAP-1 (left panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The data (Fig. 2) show that PAP-1 recognizes two main proteins in quiescent RPE cells, a p50 protein and an unknown 200-kDa protein. In tamoxifen-activated RPE cells, PAP-1 recognizes two additional proteins of 65 and 120 kDa. These were not seen in RPE cells activated with phorbol esters that activate PKC but not PKB pathways. The immunoreactivity of PAP-1 was competed by the immunizing PAP-1 phospho-peptide. It is of note that the immunoreactivity pattern of PAP-1 with lysates from PKB-activated RPE cells was different from that seen in antigen receptor-activated T cells.During the course of these experiments, Cell Signaling Technology(Beverley, MA) raised an antiserum against a mixture of phosphorylated PKB substrate peptides. This antiserum recognizes the PKB substrate sequence RXRXX pS/T, where Xis any amino acid and is referred to as a CST-pan PKB phospho-substrate antiserum (21Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar, 22Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22115-22118Google Scholar). An important question was whether PAP-1 is also a pan PKB substrate antiserum with an overlapping immunoreactivity with this commercial antiserum. Accordingly, the immunoreactivity of PAP-1 and the CST pan PKB phospho-substrate antiserum on RPE cells that express a tamoxifen-inducible PKB was also compared (Fig. 2,A versus B). Key points were that the CST-pan PKB phospho-substrate antiserum had a completely different pattern of reactivity to PAP-1 in RPE cells. The pan PKB substrate antiserum did not react with a p50 protein corresponding to GSK3α. Nor did the pan PKB substrate antiserum recognize the PAP-1-reactive p65 or p120 proteins; rather, it recognized a major protein, p70, in tamoxifen-activated cells and p70 plus an additional p97 protein in phorbol ester-activated cells. The pan PKB substrate antiserum was also strongly reactive with a number of proteins migrating around p200 that were not seen with PAP-1. Strikingly, the pan PKB phospho-substrate antiserum was strongly reactive with proteins from PDBu-activated RPE cells, whereas PAP-1 was not.These results indicate that PAP-1 has the potential to recognize novel PKB substrates. However, its different pattern of immunoreactivity to the commercial pan PKB substrate antisera indicates that PAP-1 is not broadly reactive with all PKB substrates. One further indication that PAP-1 does not recognize all PKB substrates is given by the T cell data in Fig. 1. Thus both GSK3α and the faster migrating GSK3β are known PKB substrates, and commercial antisera selectively reactive with phospho-GSK3α and β thus recognize a doublet of proteins. In contrast, PAP-1 only detected the 50-kDa GSK3α protein and not the GSK3α/β doublet (Fig. 1, B and C).To explore the selectivity of PAP-1 further, the immunoreactivity of this antiserum was examined by ELISA. Fig.3 A shows that PAP-1 displayed a strong immunoreactivity with the immunizing phospho-peptide Ser-21 in GSK3α but did not recognize a range of other phosphorylated PKB substrate peptides, including phospho-Ser-256 in FKHR (28Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar), phospho-Thr-32 in FKHRL1 (31Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar), phospho-Thr-23 in IKK (29Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Google Scholar), and phospho-Ser-136 in BAD (32Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar). To conclude, PAP-1 is not a pan PKB substrate antiserum but rather a phospho-peptide specific antiserum with the potential to recognize a subset of PKB substrates.Figure 3A, absence of reactivity of PAP-1 against known PKB substrates. ELISA immunoreactivity results are shown of PAP-1 with peptides conforming to the phosphorylated sequences of known PKB substrates and one irrelevant P-peptide (Irrelevant peptide) unable to be phosphorylated by PKB. Phospho-peptide sequences were as follows; GSK3α-S21: RARTSpSFAE; FKHR-S256: RRRAApSMONN; IKKα-T23: RERLGpTGGFG; AFX-T28: RPRSCpTWPLP; AFX-S258: FRPRSSpSNAS; BAD-S136: RGRSRpSAPPN; FKHRL1-T32: RPRSCpTWPLQ.

Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-pan GSK3α/β (bottom panel). C, PAP-1 and CST-pan PKB antisera have different immunoreactivity patterns.

Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-pan GSK3α/β (bottom panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The previous data show that PAP-1 can recognize a subset of PKB substrates, but another question is whether it has a broader specificity. In this context, GSK3α Ser-21 phosphorylation can be regulated by PKB or via a PKC-mediated response (33Fang X. Yu S. Tanyi J.L. Lu Y. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2099-2110Google Scholar, 34Shaw M. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 120-124Google Scholar). It would be predicted that the PAP-1-reactive proteins phosphorylated by PI3K-mediated pathways in antigen receptor pathways might also be phosphorylated in response to activation of PKC with phorbol esters. Fig. 3 B examines the effects of activation of T cells with the phorbol ester; phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) on PAP-1-recognized proteins. PDBu mimics diacylglycerol and triggers protein kinase C and D (PKC/PKD)-mediated responses without PKB activation. T cells induce high levels of PAP1p50 (GSK3α) phosphorylation when activated with phorbol esters. PAP1p85 and p55 were also seen in phorbol ester-treated cells. The reactivity of CST-pan PKB antiserum with antigen receptor or PDBu-activated T cells was also examined (Fig. 3 C). This antiserum also recognized proteins in activated T cells, but its pattern of immunoreactivity was different to that of PAP-1. The CST-pan PKB antiserum was strongly reactive with a 90-kDa protein in quiescent and activated T cells. This band was not seen in PAP-1 Western blots. PAP-1 was strongly reactive with p55 and p85, and these were not seen with CST-pan PKB. Conversely, CST-pan PKB recognizes p60 and p100 proteins in activated T cells, and these were not seen with PAP-1. The CST-pan PKB recognizes a p50 protein in phorbol ester but not TCR-activated T cells, whereas PAP-1 recognizes a p50 protein in TCR and phorbol ester-activated cells.Identification of PAP-1-reactive Protein p55PAP-1 was able to recognize a number of proteins phosphorylated via PI3K pathways in antigen receptor-activated T cells. It can also recognize proteins phosphorylated in T cells activated via a phorbol ester/PKC pathway. Its immunoreactivity is highly selective for the cognate immunizing phospho-peptide, but it is not a pan kinase substrate antiserum. It has very different patterns of immunoreactivity in different cell populations and on cells activated by different stimuli. It thus recognizes protein phosphorylation events at the level where there is convergence of signaling of multiple pathways. PAP-1 can therefore be used to pinpoint novel cell specific or stimulus specific phosphorylation events for future analysis.Given the selectivity of PAP-1 for its cognate phospho-peptide, all of these proteins are likely to contain a phosphorylated peptide sequence structurally similar to GSK3α Ser-21. The next stage in this process was to purify PAP-1-identified proteins. From the experiments described above, the PAP-1-reactive protein p55 was selected for further work. The rationale for this choice was that this was an antigen receptor-regulated protein. Moreover, a comparison of the PAP-1 phospho-fingerprint of T cells and RPE cells indicated that p55 is selectively expressed/regulated in T lymphocytes. This was confirmed by extensive comparisons of the pattern of PAP-1 immunoreactivity with cell lysates isolated from different cell populations (data not shown).Initial experiments found that the PAP-1 antiserum could not selectively immunoprecipitate proteins from activated T cells. Alternative experimental protocols were therefore devised to purify p55 to homogeneity for protein sequence analysis by mass spectrometry. Cell lysates were prepared from 9 × 109 activated T lymphoblasts, and the lysates were fractionated initially on heparin-Sepharose columns; a second step purification on Mono Q columns was performed followed by separation by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels. At each stage the presence of p55 in different column fractions was determined by Western blot analysis with PAP-1. Fig.4 shows the elution profiles on heparin-Sepharose (Fig. 4 A) and Mono Q columns (Fig.4 B) of p50 and p55 PAP-1-reactive proteins. p50 co-eluted with GSK3α, whereas p55 had distinct elution patterns. Fig.4 C (left panel) shows silver-stained two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels of the final fractionation step; Fig.4 C (right panel) shows the corresponding PAP-1 Western blot analysis of the purified material. The protein spots corresponding to p55 were then digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (35Kust"

However, glycogen accumulation was higher in hepatocytes incubated with glucose than in those treated with DHA. This difference was attributed to decreased futile cycling through GS and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) in the glucose-treated hepatocytes, owing to the partial inactivation of GP induced by glucose. Our results indicate that the gluconeogenic pathway and the glucokinase-mediated phosphorylation of glucose deliver their common product to the same Glc-6-P pool, which is accessible to liver GS. As observed in the treatment with glucose, incubation of cultured hepatocytes with DHA caused the translocation of GS from a uniform cytoplasmic distribution to the hepatocyte periphery and a similar pattern of glycogen deposition. We hypothesize that Glc-6-P has a major role in glycogen metabolism not only by determining the activation state of GS but also by controlling its subcellular distribution in the hepatocyte.

It is produced from glucose and ATP, by the action of glucokinase (GK), from three carbon-atom precursors through gluconeogenesis and as a result of glycogen breakdown. In turn, Glc-6-P is a substrate for glycolysis, for the pentose-phosphate pathway and for the production of glucose, via glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase)-catalyzed hydrolysis, or glycogen, through a pathway that involves the successive conversion of Glc-6-P into glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) and UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), the substrate of glycogen synthase (GS). GS and GK are the key enzymes in the control of hepatic glycogen synthesis from glucose (1Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Google Scholar). The activity of the former is tightly regulated by phosphorylation and by allosteric effectors (2Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Google Scholar), mainly Glc-6-P. This metabolite is an allosteric activator of GS, and more importantly, it also promotes the permanent, covalent activation of GS by dephosphorylation (3Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Google Scholar). Furthermore, upon incubation with glucose, GS is redistributed in the hepatocyte, which may be an additional mechanism of control (4Ferrer J.C. Baqué S. Fernández-Novell J.M. Garcı́a-Rocha M. Guinovart J.J. Cornish-Bouden A. Cárdenas M.L. Technological and Medical Implications of Metabolic Control Analysis.

In the absence of glucose hepatic GS is uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but it concentrates at the hepatocyte periphery when it is present (5Fernández-Novell J.M. Bellido D.

In hepatocytes with low initial glycogen content, the polysaccharide is synthesized first near the plasma membrane and then, as the synthesis progresses, in more internal locations (6Garcı́a-Rocha M.

In the absence of substrate, GK concentrates in the nucleus, where it remains bound to its regulatory protein, and it translocates to the cytoplasm when the levels of glucose or fructose increase. Hepatic GS, but not muscle GS, differentiates between Glc-6-P produced by GK or hexokinase I (HK I). Only Glc-6-P produced from glucose by GK can induce the dephosphorylation and consequent activation of liver GS and trigger the synthesis of glycogen (13Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Google Scholar, 14Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcı́a-Rocha M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23246-23252Google Scholar). These results indicate there are at least two pools of Glc-6-P inside the hepatocyte. The pool accessible to liver GS is replenished by the action of GK, whereas the Glc-6-P produced by HK I is delivered to a cellular compartment from which GS is excluded. Here we examine, in cultured hepatocytes, biochemical and cellular aspects of the synthesis of glycogen from dihydroxyacetone (DHA), an efficient gluconeogenic substrate (15Gustafson L.A. Neeft M. Reijngoud D.J. Kuipers F. Sauerwein H.P. Romijn J.A. Herling A.W. Burger H.J. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 665-671Google Scholar). We used recombinant adenovirus technology to compare the role of Glc-6-P produced by gluconeogenesis with that arising from the direct phosphorylation of glucose by GK, in the activation of hepatic GS and its translocation to the cell periphery. The AdCMV-RLGS adenovirus has been described in a previous report (1Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Google Scholar). AdCMV-GK (16Scott D.K. O'Doherty R.M. Stafford J.M. Newgard C.B. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24145-24151Google Scholar) and AdCMV-G6Pase (17Trinh K. Minassian C. Lange A.J. O'Doherty R.M. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24837-24842Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. C. B. Newgard. Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion from male Wistar rats (180–225 g) fasted for 24 h, as described previously (18Massagué J. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 317-320Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, Israel), 100 nm insulin, and 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and then seeded onto plastic plates of 60-mm diameter treated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) at a final density of 8 × 104cells/cm2. After cell attachment (4 h at 37 °C), the medium was replaced by DMEM without glucose, fetal bovine serum, and hormones, and hepatocytes were treated for 2 h with AdCMV-RLGS, AdCMV-GK, or AdCMV-G6Pase at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for the first adenovirus and 4 for the other two. The medium was again replaced by DMEM without glucose, fetal bovine serum, and hormones, and cells were kept at 37 °C for an additional 16–18 h, to allow for the expression of the transgen. Finally, hepatocytes were incubated in the same medium supplemented with glucose or DHA at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. At the end of each manipulation, cell monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and frozen in liquid N2 until analysis, or fixed for immunofluorescence studies. To measure glycogen content, cell monolayers were scraped into 30% KOH, the extract was then boiled for 15 min and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min. Glycogen was measured in the cleared supernatants as described (19Chan T.M. Exton J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 96-105Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of Glc-6-P was measured using a spectrophotometric assay (20Lang G. Michal G. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1974: 1238-1242Google Scholar). Glucose concentration in the incubation medium was measured as described (21Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Google Scholar). Frozen cell monolayers from 60-mm diameter plates were scraped using 100 μl of homogenization buffer, which consisted of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm KF, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Thawing induced cell lysis. Protein concentration was measured using a Bio-Rad assay reagent as described (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Total GS activity was measured in homogenates in the presence of 6.6 mm Glc-6-P, as described (23Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Google Scholar). Active GS (I ora form) was measured in the absence of Glc-6-P. Glucose-phosphorylating activity was measured spectrophotometrically in the supernatant fraction of hepatocyte extracts centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, using 1 mm or 100 mm glucose at 30 °C, as described (24Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8849-8853Google Scholar). Frozen cells were scraped into a buffer solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 600 mmsucrose, and 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Homogenates were completely lysed by sonication. The activity of G6Pase was assessed spectrophotometrically in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, as in Ref.25Alegre M. Ciudad C.J. Fillat C. Guinovart J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 185-189Google Scholar. Hepatocytes seeded onto gelatin-coated glass coverslips (10 mm × 10 mm) were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were incubated with NaBH4 (1 mg/ml) to reduce auto-fluorescence, permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS. Next, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the L1 anti-liver GS (6Garcı́a-Rocha M. Roca A. de La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernández-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Google Scholar) at dilution 1/500 (v/v), washed in PBS, and treated for 30 min with T-6391 Texas Red®-X goat anti-rabbit Ig G (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes). Alternatively, cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with a monoclonal IgM antibody against glycogen, a generous gift from Dr. O. Baba (26Baba O. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1993; 60: 264-287Google Scholar), diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v), washed with PBS, and subjected to incubation for 30 min with a goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody conjugated to tetramethylrhodamine (Chemicon). For actin staining, hepatocytes were treated for 30 min with fluorescein-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were finally air-dried and mounted on glass microscope slides using Immuno Floure mounting medium (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.). Fluorescence images were obtained with a Leica TCS 4D (Leica Lasertechnik, Heidelberg, Germany) confocal scanning laser microscope adapted to an inverted Leitz DMIRBE microscope and a 63× (numerical aperture 1.4, oil) Leitz Plan-Apo objective. The light source was an argon/krypton laser (75 milliwatts), and optical sections (0.1 μm) were obtained. Active and total liver glycogen phosphorylase (GP) protein levels were measured in hepatocyte homogenates by Western blot. Electrotransfer of proteins from the gel to the nitrocellulose was performed at 200 V (constant) and room temperature for 2 h, using a Bio-Rad miniature transfer apparatus, as described (27Tobwin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Biotechnology. 1992; 24: 145-149Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline). Blots were then incubated for 1 h with antibodies against phosphorylated (active) or total GP. The antibody against active GP was raised in chicken using the peptide9EKRRQI[pSer]IRGI19, which is located near the N terminus of rat liver GP and contains the Ser residue that is phosphorylated in the active enzyme. The antibody against total GP was obtained by immunizing rabbits with the peptide829EPSDLKISLSKESSNGVNANGK850, which constitutes the C-terminal end of the protein. Membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with a secondary anti-chicken/rabbit antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), following the manufacturer's instructions. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Statistical significance was assumed atp < 0.05. We evaluated glycogen deposition in hepatocytes that were synthesizing glucose from DHA by gluconeogenesis. Hepatocytes were maintained for 16 h in a medium devoid of glucose and DHA and then incubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of DHA. These cells showed a dose-dependent increase in glycogen content (Fig.1 A), intracellular Glc-6-P concentration (Fig. 1 B) and active GS levels (Fig.1 C), whereas total GS activity did not change in any of the conditions assayed (data not shown). These effects were maximal at 10 mm DHA (Fig. 1), and, therefore, this concentration of the gluconeogenic precursor was chosen to perform subsequent experiments. To examine the effect of DHA on the intracellular distribution of hepatic GS, cultured hepatocytes were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 10 mm DHA, 10 mmglucose, and 25 mm glucose or left untreated. Immunofluorescence analysis, using an antibody that specifically recognizes liver GS (6Garcı́a-Rocha M. Roca A. de La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernández-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Google Scholar), showed that incubation with DHA produced an accumulation of the enzyme at the periphery of the hepatocytes, similar to that observed after glucose treatment. In control cells, GS was distributed throughout the cytoplasm, and, after incubation with glucose or DHA, the enzyme formed patches near the hepatocyte plasma membrane (Fig. 2 A). Immunodetection of glycogen particles with a monoclonal anti-glycogen antibody (26Baba O. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1993; 60: 264-287Google Scholar) showed that DHA also induced the deposition of the polysaccharide at the cell periphery, as observed with the hepatocytes incubated with glucose (Fig. 2 B). In control uninfected hepatocytes, a 2-h treatment with 10 mm DHA induced the deposition of 16.1 ± 0.6 μg of glycogen/106 cells. This value was 40% lower than that measured for hepatocytes incubated with 25 mm glucose (28.1 ± 0.6 μg of glycogen/106 cells) (Fig.3 A), even though the levels of Glc-6-P and active GS were somewhat higher in the former condition (Fig. 3, B and C). When total GS was overexpressed 4-fold by treatment of cultured hepatocytes with the AdCMV-RLGS adenovirus (TableI), the ability of these cells to accumulate glycogen increased substantially. However, the differences in glycogen content with the respective uninfected controls were higher in the glucose-treated hepatocytes than in those incubated with 10 mm DHA. Thus, GS-overexpressing hepatocytes treated with 5 or 25 mm glucose accumulated ∼160% more glycogen than their corresponding controls and reached a level of 73 ± 10 μg/106 cells at 25 mm glucose (Fig.3 A). In contrast, AdCMV-RLGS-infected hepatocytes incubated with 10 mm DHA deposited 28 ± 3 μg of glycogen/106 cells, which is only 70% higher than that observed for their uninfected counterparts, and represents 40% of the glycogen accumulated by GS-overexpressing hepatocytes treated with 25 mm glucose. This large difference was observed despite the fact that intracellular Glc-6-P concentration (Fig. 3 B) and active GS levels (Fig. 3 C) were similar in AdCMV-RLGS-infected hepatocytes incubated with 25 mmglucose or with 10 mm DHA. On the other hand, the increase in glycogen content observed in GS-overexpressing hepatocytes incubated with DHA was accompanied by a 13% decrease in the glucose output, which changed from 215 ± 5 to 188 ± 2 μg glucose/106 cells in uninfected and GS-overexpressing cells, respectively.Table IGlucose-phosphorylating activity, G6Pase, and total GS activity in GS-, GK-, and G6Pase-overexpressing hepatocytesGKHKG6PaseGSUntreated9.3 ± 2.63.3 ± 0.89.8 ± 0.24.4 ± 0.4AdCMV-GK27.7 ± 4.9NS1-aNS, indicates no significant differencesversus control values.NSNS(296 ± 43%)AdCMV-G6PaseNSNS25.2 ± 1NS(257 ± 10%)AdCMV-RLGSNSNSNS18.5 ± 2(420 ± 45%)Cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-GK or AdCMV-G6Pase at a moi of 4, with AdCMV-RLGS at a multiplicity of infection of 10, or were left untreated.

Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments.1-a NS, indicates no significant differencesversus control values. Open table in a new tab Cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with AdCMV-GK or AdCMV-G6Pase at a moi of 4, with AdCMV-RLGS at a multiplicity of infection of 10, or were left untreated. Cells were incubated for 16 h with DMEM without glucose, treated for 2 h with 25 mm glucose, and finally collected for measurement of GK and HK, G6Pase and total GS activities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Activities are expressed in milliunits/106 cells and as a percentage of control values. Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four independent experiments. A 3-fold overexpression of GK (Table I) caused an increase of about 120% in the intracellular Glc-6-P concentration of cultured hepatocytes treated with 5 (0.45 ± 0.10 nmol of Glc-6-P/106 cells) or 25 mm glucose (1.54 ± 0.16 nmol of Glc-6-P/106 cells), when compared with their uninfected controls (0.21 ± 0.05 and 0.66 ± 0.07 nmol Glc-6-P/106 cells, respectively) (Fig. 3 B). As a result, the levels of active GS (1.74 ± 0.07 and 2.10 ± 0.16 milliunits/106 cells, respectively) (Fig.3 C) and glycogen content (31.7 ± 3.4 and 67.2 ± 6.9 μg/106 cells, respectively) (Fig. 3 A) of AdCMV-GK-infected hepatocytes treated with 5 or 25 mmglucose also rose significantly and in a glucose-concentration dependent manner, as described previously (1Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Google Scholar). In contrast, GK overexpression did not affect the Glc-6-P concentration of hepatocytes treated with 10 mm DHA (0.80 ± 0.05 nmol of Glc-6-P/106 cells in uninfected hepatocytesversus 0.86 ± 0.14 nmol of Glc-6-P/106cells in AdCMV-GK-treated hepatocytes) (Fig. 3 B). Accordingly, the levels of active GS (1.47 ± 0.06 and 1.43 ± 0.16 milliunits/106 cells, respectively) (Fig.3 C) and glycogen content (16.0 ± 0.9 and 19.3 ± 1.5 μg/106 cells, respectively) (Fig. 3 A) remained unchanged compared with their respective controls. The ability of hepatocytes to accumulate glycogen was drastically reduced when G6Pase was overexpressed 3-fold in these cells (Table I). Cultured hepatocytes treated with AdCMV-G6Pase and incubated with 10 mm DHA and 5 or 25 mm glucose showed a decrease of 75, 35, and 50% in glycogen content, respectively, compared with their uninfected controls (Fig. 3 A). The larger drop in glycogen accumulation in hepatocytes incubated with 10 mm DHA was consistent with the larger effect of the overexpression of G6Pase on Glc-6-P concentration and active GS levels in these cells, which were respectively 25 and 45% of those determined for the uninfected controls (Fig. 3, B and C). The concentration of Glc-6-P and active GS attained in G6Pase-overexpressing hepatocytes incubated with 25 mmglucose were, respectively, 50 and 75% of the corresponding values in uninfected hepatocytes (Fig. 3, B and C). Conversely, the glucose output in G6Pase-overexpressing hepatocytes incubated with 10 mm DHA (253 ± 3 μg of glucose/106) was almost 20% higher than in the uninfected cells (215 ± 5 μg of glucose/106 cells). We analyzed the relative effectiveness of Glc-6-P, produced by direct phosphorylation of glucose or by gluconeogenesis from DHA, in activating GS and promoting glycogen deposition in cultured hepatocytes. The values of glycogen content (Fig.4 A) and active GS (Fig.4 B), which were determined in previous experiments, were plotted against the corresponding Glc-6-P concentration values. The points derived from hepatocytes infected with the AdCMV-RLGS adenovirus were not included in the plots, because in these experiments the total amount of GS was artificially augmented and, therefore, they are not comparable with the rest of the series, as we previously pointed out (1Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Google Scholar). There was a strong correlation between the levels of active GS and Glc-6-P concentration, irrespective of the origin of this metabolite. This linear correlation held throughout the range of Glc-6-P concentrations, from the lowest values, attained by means of G6Pase overexpression, to the highest, obtained in GK-overexpressing hepatocytes (Fig. 4 B). However, when glycogen content was plotted against Glc-6-P concentration, two sets of points were clearly distinguishable (Fig. 4 A). The points corresponding to hepatocytes incubated with glucose or with DHA fell in two separate straight lines with distinct slopes. Thus, the sensitivity of glycogen deposition to intracellular Glc-6-P concentration, measured as the slope of the plot, is about 2-fold higher in cultured hepatocytes incubated with glucose than in those treated with DHA (Fig.4 A). To determine whether incubation with glucose or DHA affected the levels of total or active glycogen phosphorylase (GP), we performed Western blot analysis of hepatocyte homogenates, using two antibodies directed, respectively, against two unrelated peptides contained in the sequence of rat liver GP. The first antibody, which was raised against a peptide that consists of the 22 C-terminal amino acids of the protein, was used to provide a measure of total GP. In Western blots the immune, but not the pre-immune serum, recognized a band of the expected molecular mass in rat liver extracts but not in muscle homogenates (data not shown). Muscle expresses a different GP isoform, which does not contain in its sequence the peptide used for the immunizations of the rabbits. The second antibody was raised in chicken against an 11-amino acid peptide, which includes the phosphorylated Ser residue at position 15 of the rat liver GP, and it recognized a band of the expected molecular mass in liver extracts. This band was more intense in Western blots of homogenates from cultured hepatocytes treated with 100 μm forskolin, a drug that is known to trigger the phosphorylation and, thus the activation, of GP through an increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP (Fig. 5 A). The binding of this antibody to active GP was blocked by the presence of the phosphorylated peptide used for the immunizations, but not by the analogous peptide in which the critical Ser residue (Ser-15) is not phosphorylated (Fig. 5 A). These observations indicate that the phospho-specific antibody only recognizes the active phosphorylated form of liver GP. Western blot analysis of cultured hepatocytes showed that the levels of total GP remained essentially unchanged in the incubations with 10 mm DHA and 5 or 25 mm glucose, compared with control cells (Fig. 5 B). However, whereas the levels of active GP in control cells and those incubated for 2 h with 10 mm DHA did not significantly change, incubation with 5 or 25 mm glucose led to a marked decrease in the amount of active GP. The final concentration of glucose in the medium of the hepatocytes incubated with the gluconeogenic precursor was 0.7 ± 0.1 mm. In previous reports we have shown that Glc-6-P produced by GK in cultured hepatocytes (13Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. O'Doherty R.M. Gómez-Ara C. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23756-23760Google Scholar, 28O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Google Scholar) and in FTO2B cells (14Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcı́a-Rocha M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23246-23252Google Scholar) is more effective in promoting the covalent activation of hepatic GS and the deposition of glycogen than Glc-6-P derived from the catalytic action of HK I. This result suggested that Glc-6-P is compartmentalized in at least two pools in these cells. Liver GS is excluded from the compartment where the Glc-6-P produced by HK I is directed, while it has access to the Glc-6-P pool replenished by the GK-mediated phosphorylation of glucose. This second pool is also accessible to other enzymes and provides substrate for several metabolic routes. Thus, overexpression of GK enhances not only glycogen deposition, but also glycolysis, both in cultured hepatocytes (28O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gómez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Google Scholar) and in FTO2B cells (29Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Google Scholar). Glc-6-P from this pool can also be directed to hydrolysis by G6Pase, because overexpression of the catalytic subunit of this system reduces glycogen deposition and lactate production, while it increases hydrolysis of Glc-6-P (21Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Google Scholar). The main conclusion of this study is that the gluconeogenic pathway and the direct phosphorylation of glucose by GK deliver their common product to the same “general” Glc-6-P pool, which feeds the above mentioned metabolic processes. The activation state of GS strongly correlates with the intracellular levels of Glc-6-P in hepatocytes incubated with glucose (3Villar-Palası́ C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Google Scholar, 30Ciudad C.J. Carabaza A. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1195-1200Google Scholar, 31Fernández-Novell J.M. Roca A. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 570-575Google Scholar). As shown in the present study, this positive correlation also holds when cultured hepatocytes are incubated with gluconeogenic precursors, such that Glc-6-P arising from gluconeogenesis is as effective in activating hepatic GS as Glc-6-P produced by GK (Fig. 4 B). The conversion of Glc-6-P into glucose by G6Pase and later re-phosphorylation to Glc-6-P prior to triggering the covalent activation of GS can be ruled out, because, in contrast to what occurs in hepatocytes incubated with glucose, GK overexpression has negligible effects on GS activation and glycogen deposition in hepatocytes incubated with DHA (Fig. 3). However, although liver GS activation state is equally sensitive to Glc-6-P produced by GK or by gluconeogenesis, glycogen accumulation in cultured hepatocytes is more efficient when Glc-6-P originates from direct phosphorylation of glucose by GK (Fig. 4 A). Similar levels of Glc-6-P attained by treating hepatocytes with glucose or with DHA have distinct quantitative effects on glycogen deposition. An explanation for this could reside in the observation that, although incubation with DHA has the main effect of increasing intracellular Glc-6-P concentration, treatment with glucose simultaneously triggers the partial dephosphorylation and inactivation of GP (Fig. 5) (2Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Google Scholar, 32Carabaza A. Ciudad C.J. Baqué S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 211-214Google Scholar), thus causing the arrest of glycogenolysis and allowing higher rates of glycogen accumulation. This is possible, because GLUT-2, the main glucose transporter in hepatocytes, essentially maintains intra- and extracellular glucose concentration in equilibrium. Hepatocytes can synthesize glucose from gluconeogenic precursors, but after 2 h of incubation with 10 mm DHA, the medium in which the cultured cells were kept only contained 0.7 mm glucose. This concentration is too low to significantly inactivate GP. Through the use of GP inhibitors that cause its inactivation by dephosphorylation, it has been shown (15Gustafson L.A. Neeft M. Reijngoud D.J. Kuipers F. Sauerwein H.P. Romijn J.A. Herling A.W. Burger H.J. Meijer A.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 665-671Google Scholar, 33Bergans N. Stalmans W. Goldman S. Vanstapel F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1419-1426Google Scholar, 34Aiston S. Hampson L. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Agius L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23858-23866Google Scholar) that active GP plays a role in controlling the phosphorylation state of GS. The covalent inactivation of GP relieves glycogen synthase phosphatase from the allosteric inhibition caused by active GP, thus leading to the dephosphorylation and activation of GS (2Bollen M. Keppens S. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 19-31Google Scholar). However, in our experimental conditions, the levels of active GS strongly correlate with the intracellular Glc-6-P concentration, regardless of the GP activation state, indicating that GP inactivation is not a prerequisite for the covalent activation of GS. An identical conclusion was obtained from two previous studies in which the treatment with fructose (35Ciudad C.J. Massagué J. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1979; 99: 321-324Google Scholar) or lithium chloride (36Bosch F. Gómez-Foix A.M. Ariño J. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16927-16931Google Scholar) of hepatocytes isolated from fasted rats led to the simultaneous activation of GS and GP. These two apparently contradictory conclusions may be reconciled by assuming that the levels of active GP do have an effect in determining the GS activation state, as long as the intracellular concentration of Glc-6-P remains constant. However, an increase in the Glc-6-P concentration would override the allosteric inhibition of glycogen synthase phosphatase by active GP, thus causing a corresponding increase in the levels of active GS in cultured hepatocytes. Our results also suggest that the lower efficiency shown by Glc-6-P produced by gluconeogenesis in stimulating glycogen deposition could be attributed to a futile cycle through GS and GP, because both enzymes co-exist as their respective active forms in hepatocytes incubated with DHA. Glycogen cycling has been shown to occur in vivo andin vitro by several techniques that include the utilization of stable or radioactive isotopes (37Shulman G.I. Rothman D.L. Chung Y. Rossetti L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25727-25735Google Scholar) have analyzed how the degree of glucose cycling, through GK and G6Pase, and glycogen cycling affect glycogen accumulation in isolated hepatocytes. By means of acute inhibition of the hepatic G6Pase system with S4048, a chlorogenic acid derivative that inhibits translocation of Glc-6-P across the endoplasmic-reticulum membrane, these authors have altered the partitioning of Glc-6-P produced by gluconeogenesis into glucose production and storage as glycogen. This partitioning can also be modulated by the overexpression of the enzymes involved in this metabolism. Thus, GS overexpression in cultured hepatocytes re-directs part of the Glc-6-P produced by gluconeogenesis from DHA to glycogen deposition, with the consequent reduction of glucose output. Conversely, the overexpression of the catalytic subunit of G6Pase has opposite effects. Another point that we have addressed in this report is the study of the subcellular distribution of hepatic GS. We have previously shown that incubation of isolated (5Fernández-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 227-231Google Scholar) or cultured hepatocytes (6Garcı́a-Rocha M. Roca A. de La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernández-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Google Scholar) with glucose causes the translocation of GS from the cytoplasm to the cell periphery, where initial glycogen synthesis takes place. When added to cultured hepatocytes, DHA has the same effect as glucose on the localization of GS and the pattern of glycogen deposition. We propose that Glc-6-P is the key metabolite that controls the subcellular distribution of hepatic GS, such that an increase in the intracellular concentration of Glc-6-P triggers the accumulation of GS at the hepatocyte periphery. This is based in the following reasoning. First, the mere activation of GS induced by treatment with lithium chloride, a known inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (42Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Google Scholar, 43Orena S.J. Torchia A.J. Garofalo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15765-15772Google Scholar), is not sufficient to cause GS translocation to the hepatocyte periphery (6Garcı́a-Rocha M. Roca A. de La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernández-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Google Scholar). Second, the common metabolites in the biosynthetic pathway of glycogen from glucose and from gluconeogenic precursors are Glc-6-P, which is in equilibrium with Glc-1-P, and UDP-Glc, the substrate of GS and immediate precursor in glycogen synthesis. Of these three intermediates, UDP-Glc can be ruled out as the signal molecule, because its intracellular concentration appears to be buffered and remains unchanged upon wide variations of Glc-6-P. Thus, GK (1Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Google Scholar) and G6Pase (21Seoane J. Trinh K. O'Doherty R.M. Gomez-Foix A.M. Lange A.J. Newgard C.B. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26972-26977Google Scholar) overexpression in cultured hepatocytes led, respectively, to a large increase or decrease in the Glc-6-P levels, which in turn translated into increased or decreased glycogen accumulation. However, the intracellular concentration of UDP-Glc did not significantly change in any of these situations. Third, Glc-6-P is involved in the control of the aggregation state of hepatic GS and its translocation from a soluble form to a form that sediments at low centrifugal forces, both in isolated hepatocytes (44Fernández-Novell J.M. Ariño J. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 443-448Google Scholar) and in vivo (31Fernández-Novell J.M. Roca A. Bellido D. Vilaró S. Guinovart J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 570-575Google Scholar). Therefore Glc-6-P, not only constitutes the crossroad of several metabolic pathways, but it also plays a key role as a signal molecule in the regulation of hepatic glycogen metabolism. It determines the activation state of GS and controls the aggregation state and the subcellular distribution of GS in hepatocytes. We thank Dr. C. B.

Metal ion analysis performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy shows the presence of ∼1 equivalent of iron, 0.27 equivalent of manganese, and 0.1 equivalent of zinc per mole of protein as isolated. The metal ion content coupled with the visible absorption feature is compatible with the presence of Fe3+-tyrosinate coordination. When scPLD was dialyzed against solutions containing Mn2+, Zn2+ or EDTA, the Fe3+content was reduced to variable extents, and the residual specific activity correlated well with the residual iron content. Sequence homology with metal ion binding motifs in known alkaline phosphatases and purple acid phosphatase from red kidney bean shows that most of the residues involved in metal ion coordination are conserved among all the sequences considered. Mutation of some of these conserved residues (C123A, D151A, Y154F, and H391A) produced enzymes lacking iron with dramatically reduced PLD activity but little change in secondary structure or ability to bind to small unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine (with Ba2+) or phosphatidic acid.

PLD activities are present in all organisms from bacteria to mammals. In higher organisms, PLDs, associated with membranes and in the cytosol, play an important role in signal transduction by production of the second messenger PA and its derivative lyso-phosphatidic acid (1Witter B. Kanfer J.N. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the presence of a primary alcohol, PLD catalyzes a transphosphatidylation reaction (2Yang S.F. Freer S.

Faiman G. Eldar H. Livneh E. J. Lipid Mediat. 1993; 8: 177-182PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotic enzymes are activated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate, ARF1, RhoA, and RalA (4Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem.

Members of the PLD superfamily are characterized by the presence of a conserved domain containing in its minimal element the sequence HXK(X)4D, or the HKD motif. The HKD motif has been proposed to be important for catalysis (7Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol.

Most of the PLD enzymes described to date contain either two HKD motifs or only one copy of this sequence, and dimerization of two identical monomers is required to form the active site (13Rudolph A.E.

Despite the observation that the highest activity is observed when the lipids are in an aggregated form (e.g. PC micelles or small unilamellar vesicles), scPLD is also able to hydrolyze a short-chain monomeric lipid such as diC4PC (see Table I). scPLD is a soluble enzyme with a molecular mass of 55 kDa that is secreted in the extracellular media where it is proteolytically cleaved to form an activated complex of 37 and 18 kDa peptides (24Geng D.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2958-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and analysis of the primary sequence deduced from the gene sequence shows no classical HKD motif. scPLD has a requirement for mm Ca2+ for the binding and hydrolysis of PC or PE substrate presented in small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) or in detergent-mixed micelles (6Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is also required for optimal hydrolysis of diC4PC and diC6PC; addition of EDTA or EGTA abolishes PLD activity toward monomeric phospholipid substrate (6Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Zhou C. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys.

A kinetic Kd for Ca2+ of about 60 μm was determined using soluble short-chain phospholipids as substrate (24Geng D. Baker D.P. Foley S.F. Zhou C. Stieglitz K. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). If no metal ion is present, scPLD binds weakly to PC vesicles. When Ba2+ is added to PC SUVs instead of Ca2+, binding of scPLD to SUVs is observed but not PC hydrolysis (23Stieglitz K. Seaton B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35367-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ seems to be an essential cofactor for the binding and hydrolysis of substrate vesicles. In the process of characterizing recombinant scPLD, we observed a visible absorption feature consistent with the presence of a transition metal (29Doi K. Antanaitis B.C. Aisen P. Struct. Bonding. 1988; 70: 1-26Crossref Google Scholar, 30Vogel A. Spener F. Krebs B. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wieghardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, UK2001Google Scholar, 31Klabunde T. Krebs B. Struct. Bonding. 1997; 89: 177-198Crossref Google Scholar). This prompted us to: i) run a BLAST search specifically aimed at locating potential residues involved in metal ion coordination, ii) analyze metal ion content of recombinant wild type protein, and iii) prepare and characterize seven mutants (C123A, D151A, Y154F, H212A, E213A, D389A, and H391A) based on metal ion binding motifs in other phosphatases as detected with the BLAST search. That four of these mutants were inactive and had dramatically reduced iron suggests metal ion content, and iron, in particular, is critical for the activity of this unique PLD. Continuous colorimetric assays using pNPPC andpNPP were used to further investigate the catalytic mechanism of S. chromofuscus PLD and, in particular, the apparent Ca2+ requirement of the enzyme and the ability to hydrolyze phosphodiester substrates. From the results of these studies, we propose a novel mechanism for the scPLD-catalyzed hydrolysis of phospholipids involving a binuclear iron/manganese (and possibly zinc) site as cofactor. In our model, Ca2+ plays a secondary role and is not required for catalysis. Rather it is critical for PLD to bind to phospholipid aggregates. Based on catalytic properties and sequence homology we suggest that this enzyme is a member of a novel enzyme class of phosphodiesterases related to iron-dependent alkaline phosphatases and purple acid phosphatases. pNPPC, pNPP, and AP were obtained from Sigma. All the other chemicals were of the highest purity available. The gene encoding PLD from S. chromofuscus was cloned in plasmid pTYB11 (IMPACT system, New England Biolabs) and expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting intein-PLD fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin column. PLD was cleaved from the intein by incubation for 12 h with a buffer containing 50 mm DTT and eluted with the same buffer lacking DTT. Immediately after elution of PLD, the enzyme was quickly concentrated, and the DTT was removed by extensive dialysis against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8. If instead the protein was left in the high DTT solution for over 24 h, the enzyme lost a considerable amount of activity; the longer the incubation the more activity that was lost. The protein obtained after dialysis was at least 90% pure (28Yang H. Roberts M.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2958-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples of scPLD were also dialyzed against buffers containing metal ions or EDTA. Excess metal ion and EDTA were removed by extensively dialyzing the samples against buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8. Mutants (D151A, Y154F, H212A, E213A, D389A, H391A) were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL kit (32Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol.

The following primers and their complements were used (the modified nucleotides areunderlined): 5′-CCTGGCTGCACCTCGGCGCGTACATCTACGAGTACGGCGCC-3′ (D151A); 5′-GGCGACCTGGACGCCTGGCTGCACCTCGGCGACTACATCTTCGAGTACGGCGCCGGCGAG-3′ (Y154F); 5′-GGTCGTGGCGATCTGGGACGACGCGGAGATAGCCAACGACACC-3′ (H212A); 5′-GCGATCTGGGACGACCACGCGATAGCCAACGACACCTGG-3′ (E213A); 5′-CACGGTCTTCCTCACCGGCGCGATCCACATGGCCTGGGCC-3′ (D389A); 5′-CCTCACCGGCGACATCGCGATGGCCTGGGCCAACGACGTCCC-3′ (H391A). PLD activity was measured as the hydrolysis of pNPPC to choline andpNPP, which in turn was further hydrolyzed by AP topNP and inorganic phosphate. Rates, determined at least in duplicate, were calculated as absorbance at 405 nm (ε = 18450m−1 cm−1) due to production ofpNP. In other experiments, pNPP was used as a substrate and no AP was added. In both cases the kinetics were carried out in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8, 250 mm KCl, and 30 mm CaCl2. When required, CaCl2 was omitted. No EDTA was present in the assay mixtures. PLD absorption spectra were obtained on a Beckman DU-600 spectrophotometer. All the wavelength scans were obtained in the range 260–800 nm, and the absorbance at 280 was used to normalize the spectra for protein concentration. The metal ion content of PLD samples and buffers was determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences ICP-MS (model PE ELAN 6100 DRC). Initially, metal ion content was determined with two methods. In the first, a minimum of 50 μg of PLD were diluted in 5 ml of 0.5% (v/v) HNO3 to digest the protein and release the metal ions. In the second method, the enzyme was ashed with a low temperature asher LFE model LTA-504 (power, 150 W; oxygen flow, 20 ml/min; vacuum, 0.46 mm Hg). The ashed material was dissolved in 0.1% HNO3. With both protocols, the solutions obtained were used without any further manipulation. Direct dilution or ashing of protein gave identical results, and we chose to use the direct dilution protocol for most of the experiments. The mass of scPLD with variable metal ion content was determined by MALDI-TOF using sinapinic acid as the matrix. PLD concentration was 20 μm in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Relative secondary structure elements of wild type and mutant PLD were extracted from CD spectra using an AVIV 202 spectrophotometer. Protein samples were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and diluted to a final concentration of 0.2–0.3 mg/ml. Spectra were acquired in a cuvette with optical pathlength of 0.1 cm. Each wavelength scan was acquired in the range 195–260 nm at 25 °C and deconvoluted with the program CDNN (33Böhm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) using molar ellipticity between 200 and 260 nm. The thermal denaturation (or melting) temperature of wild type and recombinant PLDs was also determined by CD spectroscopy. The temperature of the sample was varied from 25 °C to 85 °C (1 °C increments, 60 s equilibration time), and the increase in ellipticity at 222 nm was monitored.Tm values were obtained as the peak of the first derivative of each melting curve. PLD solutions (10 μg/ml, 500 μl total) were incubated with or without POPC or POPA SUVs at a total lipid concentration of 100 μm. Samples containing POPC also contained 1 mm EDTA or 1 mmBaCl2. The solutions were centrifuged through an Amicon microcon-100 filter to separate free from vesicle-bound enzyme. The filtrate was lyophilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (23Stieglitz K. Seaton B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35367-35374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). scPLD is capable of hydrolyzing phosphatidylcholine presented as monomers, micelles, or in vesicles. The product PA enhances PC cleavage in vesicles (TableI and Ref. 6Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The large increase in activity seen when monomeric PC aggregates to form micelles (interfacial activation) is not observed with this phospholipase (6Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although there is an enhanced activity as the acyl chain length is increased from four to six carbons (Table I). The enzyme can also catalyze the hydrolysis of PS and PE monomers but shows preference in terms ofkcat/Km for PC. The monomeric compound pNPPC is also a substrate for scPLD, althoughkcat/Km is much lower than for any of the phospholipids substrates with a major loss in efficiency due to a weaker Km (Table I). scPLD can also carry out a transphosphatidylation reaction with primary alcohols. However, unlike HKD PLDs, a much higher amount of alcohol is necessary for the reaction. When using methanol as the alcohol, virtually no phosphatidylmethanol is detected with less than 10% methanol; in the presence of 50% of methanol, production of phosphatidylmethanol is greater than the hydrolysis product PA. Despite the fact that scPLD catalyzes a phospholipase D reaction (hydrolysis of PC to PA and choline), it is also able to carry out a phosphatase reaction with pNPP to give pNP and inorganic phosphate (Table I). This phosphatase activity is never observed when using soluble lipids (e.g. the diC4PA from diC4PC cleavage is not hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol and inorganic phosphate) or small unilamellar vesicles (no inorganic phosphate is produced from incubating PA vesicles with scPLD) as substrates. When both pNPPC andpNPP are used as substrates, the efficiency of catalysis is significantly lower than that observed for physiological phospholipid substrates (Table I). This broader specificity is one characteristic that differentiates scPLD from the PLD enzymes in the HKD superfamily. When PLD activity is determined using pNPPC in the presence of large enzyme concentration (>10 μg/ml), production of pNP in the coupled assay is observed in the absence of Ca2+. The activity detected under these conditions, determined as slope of the initial phase of hydrolysis (5–10 s after starting acquisition), is about 40 times lower (kcat = 0.05 s−1) than the activity measured in the presence of Ca2+. The total absence of Ca2+ from the assays where this metal ion was not added has been confirmed by ICP-MS. Neither enzyme solution or assay mixture contained Ca2+. The residual Ca2+-independent activity was abolished by the addition of 1 mm EDTA. When PLD was dialyzed against 1 mm EDTA, followed by dialysis against buffer not containing EDTA to remove the chelating agent, a partially active enzyme (∼27% of the original activity) was obtained under normal assay conditions with an excess Ca2+ added (TableII). Whatever ion the EDTA is removing, it appears not to be Ca2+.Table IIMetal content and relative activity of scPLD after dialysis with solutions containing 100 μm FeCl2, MnCl2, ZnCl2, or 100 μm EDTA and removal of excess metal ions or chelating agentAdditiveMetal:ProteinIronManganeseZincRelative activity2-aThe activity was measured against pNPPC as described under “Experimental Procedures”; the error in activity determination was ± 5%.%1.12 (0.39)2-bAverage of five determinations on independent batches of enzyme.

Open table in a new tab The EDTA inhibition of the Ca2+-independent PLD activity and the loss of Ca2+-stimulated activity upon EDTA dialysis suggests that other metal ions are involved in the mechanism of catalysis. Two distinct observations are consistent with metal ions tightly bound to PLD. (i) Prolonged incubation with DTT causes a reduction in the PLD mass of 50–60 Da, as determined by MALDI-TOF MS and <10% residual activity. (ii) scPLD shows a distinctive absorbance band in the visible region with λmax ∼570 nm (Fig.1). This visible absorption feature is reduced when the enzyme is incubated with DTT for over 24 h. An absorbance band with this λmax is unusual in biomolecules and is most similar to the characteristic visible absorption spectrum detected for the tyrosinate-Fe3+ complex observed in purple acid phosphatases (PAP) and some alkaline phosphatases (AP). Both these two classes of enzymes are characterized by the presence of a dimetal ion center in which one of the metals is always Fe3+coordinated to a tyrosine hydroxyl group, while the second ion can be Fe2+, Zn2+ or Mn2+ (34Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). According to the generally accepted model of action for PAP, the dimetal ion center is involved in substrate binding and catalysis. ICP-MS analysis of scPLD sa"

UL42 had no effect on the pre-steady-state rate constant for correct nucleotide incorporation (150 s−1) nor on the primary rate-limiting conformational step. However, the equilibrium dissociation constant for the enzyme in a stable complex with primer-template was 44 nm for Pol and 7.0 nm for Pol/UL42. The catalytic subunit and holoenzyme both selected against incorrect nucleotide incorporation predominantly at the level of nucleotide affinity, although UL42 slowed by 4-fold the maximum rate of incorporation of incorrect, compared with correct, nucleotide. Pol, with or without UL42, cleaved matched termini at a slower rate than mismatched ones, but UL42 did not significantly alter the pre-steady-state rate constant for mismatch excision (∼16 s−1). The steady-state rate constant for nucleotide addition was 0.09 s−1 and 0.03 s−1 for Pol and Pol/UL42, respectively, and enzyme dissociation was the rate-limiting step. The longer half-life for DNA complexes with Pol/UL42 (23 s) compared with that with Pol (8 s) affords a greater probability for excision when a misincorporation event does occur, accounting predominantly for the failure of Pol/UL42 to accumulate mismatched product at moderate nucleotide concentrations.

In fact, there has been much disagreement regarding the general role of processivity factors on the fidelity of their cognate polymerases. For example, proliferating cell nuclear antigen has been shown to increase base substitution errors and translesion synthesis by pol δ (19Mozzherin D.J. McConnell M. Jasko M.V. Krayevsky A.A.

Surprisingly, UL42 does not alter the pre-steady-state rate constant for correct nucleotide incorporation by Pol nor that for excision of mismatched primer termini, although UL42 dramatically decreases the accumulation of misincorporated products under pre-steady-state conditions. Because UL42 decreases the dissociation of Pol from the primer-template, these results suggest that the editing of misincorporated nucleotides is facilitated by the increased time of residence of Pol/UL42 on DNA, compared with that of Pol.

Numerous cytotoxic agents exert their deleterious effects via the formation of lesions and adducts in DNA; these effects may include oxidized purine and pyrimidine residues, abasic sites, and single and double strand breaks. Ionizing radiation induces damage in DNA by direct ionization and through the generation of hydroxyl radicals that attack DNA, resulting in single strand breaks and oxidative damage to sugar and base residues (1Wallace S.S. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1988; 12: 431-477Google Scholar). Two or more DNA lesions of the same or different nature may be produced proximal to each other on the same or opposite DNA strands, generally within two helical turns of the DNA. These various types of DNA damage, known as “clustered DNA lesions,” may include strand breaks containing damaged DNA termini accompanied by multiple base lesions of varying complexity (2Cunniffe S.

Individual base damages within a cluster are repaired by base excision repair (BER). 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP sites, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, abasic sites; APE1, human AP endonuclease; Pol β, DNA polymerase β; dRP, 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate; Tg, thymine glycol (5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine); DTT, dithiothreitol 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; AP sites, apurinic/apyrimidinic sites, abasic sites; APE1, human AP endonuclease; Pol β, DNA polymerase β; dRP, 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate; Tg, thymine glycol (5,6-dihydroxy-5,6-dihydrothymidine); DTT, dithiothreitol BER is a multiprotein pathway with a broad substrate specificity that is determined by the damage-specific glycosylases. DNA glycosylases initiate BER by recognizing damaged or abnormal bases and cleaving the glycosylic bond linking the base to the sugar phosphate backbone (5Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Google Scholar). The majority of the apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP sites) formed are further processed by the so-called “short-patch” BER pathway (6Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Google Scholar). In human cells this pathway is activated by an AP endonuclease (APE1) that introduces a DNA strand break 5′ to the AP site (7Robson C.N. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5519-5523Google Scholar). This strand break cannot be ligated directly; therefore, DNA polymerase β (Pol β) first adds one nucleotide to the 3′-end of the nicked AP site, and then the dRP lyase activity of Pol β catalyzes β-elimination of the 5′-sugar phosphate residue (8Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Google Scholar). This creates a nick containing a 3′-OH and a 5′-phosphate end that can then be sealed by the DNA ligase III-XRCC1 (x-ray cross complementing factor 1) complex (9Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Google Scholar). These repair events result in a single nucleotide repair patch, and this is therefore known as short-patch BER (6Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Google Scholar). Several groups (reviewed in Refs. 10Dianov G.L. O'Neill P. Goodhead D.T. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 745-749Google Scholar and 11Weinfeld M. Rasouli-Nia A. Chaudhry M.A. Britten R.A. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 584-589Google Scholar) have studied the effects of opposing or multiple tandem lesions on DNA glycosylases and AP endonucleases. Studies with oligonucleotides containing synthetic damage clusters on opposing strands and purified glycosylases/lyases indicate that both the identity of the component lesions and their relative spacing determine the repairability of the clustered DNA lesion (12Harrison L. Hatahet Z. Purmal A.A. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 932-941Google Scholar, 13David-Cordonnier M.-H. Laval J. O'Neill P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11865-11873Google Scholar). Studies have shown that DNA glycosylases can efficiently remove one of two closely opposed base lesions generating an abasic site. Cleavage of the AP site by AP endonuclease produces a nick close to the remaining lesion on the opposite strand. The removal of the remaining base lesion is thereby inhibited (reviewed in Refs. 10Dianov G.L. O'Neill P. Goodhead D.T. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 745-749Google Scholarand 11Weinfeld M. Rasouli-Nia A. Chaudhry M.A. Britten R.A. Radiat. Res. 2001; 156: 584-589Google Scholar). Therefore, in the course of repair, clustered lesions containing a thymine glycol opposed by damaged adenosine or an abasic site may be converted into a lesion consisting of Tg opposite to a 5′-sugar phosphate-containing single strand break. Tg blocks replication by the major replicative DNA polymerases δ and α (14Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Google Scholar,15Fischhaber P.L. Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37604-37611Google Scholar); however the effect of Tg on APE1, Pol β, and DNA ligase III, key enzymes in the major base excision repair pathway, is not known. In this study we have used oligonucleotide duplexes containing Tg located directly opposite to an AP site or an AP site preincised with APE1. Using these substrates and purified human BER proteins or human cell extracts, we characterized the effect of Tg on the repair of clustered lesions. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, were obtained from MWG-Biotech.

His-tagged human DNA ligase III and human APE1 were purified on Ni2+ agarose followed by chromatography on a phosphocellulose column and gel filtration on Sephacryl-200. HeLa whole cell extracts were prepared by the method of Manley et al. (18Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Google Scholar) and dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 2 mm DTT, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, and 0.1 m KCl. Extracts were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′-end with a T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed on a Sephadex G-25 spin column. A reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 μg of the single thymine oligonucleotide 5′-GAAGAGAGGAGAGGAGAAAGGGTAGAGAGGAAGGG AAGGAGAGAA-3′, 30 mm OsO4, and 2 μl of pyridine was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then spun through a Sephadex G-25 spin column. The presence of Tg was confirmed by the sensitivity of the modified oligonucleotide to piperidine and by cleavage of the Tg-containing oligonucleotide duplex with the NTH protein (data not shown). To prepare the oligonucleotide duplex, 5′-end labeled oligonucleotide 5′-TTCTCTCCTTCCCTTCCTCTCTUCCCTTTCTCCTCTCCTCTCTTC-3′ was annealed with a complementary oligonucleotide containing thymine or thymine glycol opposite to uracil. The equimolar solution of both oligonucleotides in TE buffer with100 mm KCl was incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, and the solution was allowed to cool slowly to 25 °C. For 3′-end labeling, the uracil-containing oligonucleotide was annealed to the two nucleotide-longer complementary oligonucleotide to create a duplex with a 5′-overhanging TT-end. This duplex was incubated with a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. After the end-filling reaction, unincorporated, labeled nucleotides were removed on a Sephadex G-25 spin column. Prior to assembly of the excision reaction, the DNA substrates (500 ng, 50 pmol) were pretreated with uracil-DNA glycosylase (200 ng, 6.25 pmol) in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm KCl. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To generate a substrate containing preincised AP sites, the AP-containing substrate (1 pmol) was pretreated with APE1 (0.3 pmol) in a buffer containing 45 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA ,and 1 mm DTT for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was carried out in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that contained 45 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and a [32P]-labeled oligonucleotide substrate (5–10 ng, 0.5–1 pmol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of Pol β at the amount indicated in the legends to Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3. After incubation for the indicated time at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of gel-loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). Following incubation at 90 °C for 3 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0.Figure 2Specificity of incorporation opposite to thymine glycol by purified Pol β. 1 pmol of the 5′-end-labeled substrate oligonucleotide duplex containing thymine glycol opposite to the preincised AP site was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with 25 fmol of Pol β in conditions described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of either dATP, dCTP, dGTP, or TTP (20 μm).

Reactions were processed as described above, and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The reactions were carried out in a reaction mixture (10 μl) that contained 45 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 70 mm KCl, 2 mmDTT, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 μmeach of the indicated dNTPs, and 32P-labeled oligonucleotide substrate (1 pmol). The reactions were initiated by the addition of whole cell extract (5 μg) and incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.2 m EDTA and 20 μl of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (1:24) mixture. After centrifugation for 2 min at 16,000 × g, 10 μl of the aqueous phase was collected, and 10 μl of the formamide dye solution was added. Following incubation at 90 °C for 2–5 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. All experiments were repeated at least 3–5 times, and representative gels are shown. In human cells after the incision of an AP site by APE1, base excision repair is continued by Pol β, which incorporates a single nucleotide into the repair gap (6Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Google Scholar, 19Sobol R.W. Horton J.K. Kuhn R. Gu H. Singhal R.K. Prasad R. Rajewsky K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 183-186Google Scholar, 20Podlutsky A.J. Dianova I.I. Podust V.N. Bohr V.A. Dianov G.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1477-1482Google Scholar). Using an oligonucleotide duplex substrate containing an AP site or a preincised AP site with a 5′-sugar phosphate moiety opposite Tg on the template strand (Fig.1 A), we first investigated whether Tg located opposite to the damage would affect DNA repair synthesis by Pol β. Surprisingly, we found that purified human Pol β (Fig. 1 B) is able to incorporate the first nucleotide opposite to Tg, although at a slower rate than on the undamaged template. Incorporation on a Tg-containing substrate by Pol β is reduced by ∼3-fold compared with the control substrate, with 25 fmol of Pol β per reaction (Fig. 1 B); however, at higher concentrations Pol β was more than 80% efficient. The important question remains whether the incorporation opposite to Tg is error-free. Using reactions containing only one of four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, we next analyzed which nucleotide is incorporated and found that incorporation by Pol β was very specific, with the dAMP residue exclusively incorporated opposite to Tg (Fig.2). At the next step of short-patch BER, Pol β catalyzes removal of the 5′-dRP residue. To study the effect of Tg on this reaction, we constructed a 3′-end-labeled substrate containing thymine or Tg opposite to the preincised AP site (Fig.3 A). Removal of the dRP from this substrate will generate an 11-mer-labeled fragment, whereas a dRP-containing fragment will migrate slightly slower on a gel. After reactions, all samples were treated with sodium borohydride to stabilize the AP sites and prevent their self-degradation during electrophoresis. Under these conditions, we found no inhibitory effect of Tg on dRP removal by Pol β. In fact, removal of the dRP from the Tg-containing substrate was even slightly faster than from control substrates (Fig. 3 B). During the last step of BER, DNA ligase III seals the DNA ends broken during repair. The ability of Tg to affect DNA ligase III was tested with a substrate simulating the last step of BER, i.e. an oligonucleotide duplex containing a single strand break opposite to thymine or Tg (Fig. 4 A). We found only a moderate (1.5-fold) reduction of the ligation rate for a substrate containing Tg compared with the control substrate containing a normal thymine (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, at certain enzyme concentrations, both purified Pol β and DNA ligase III are able to catalyze repair of an AP site opposite Tg. An important question, however, was whether the concentration of Pol β and DNA ligase III in whole cell extracts is high enough to support efficient repair of clustered lesions containing Tg. To address this question, we compared repair of the oligonucleotide duplexes containing an AP site located opposite to the Tg or opposite to thymine by human cell extracts. Tg located opposite to the AP site did not affect cleavage of the AP site by human AP endonuclease. When incubated with human cell extract, the AP site-containing substrate was cleaved within 30 s, generating the 22-mer 5′-labeled incision product (data not shown). Further repair of the AP site was monitored as restoration of the full-length 45-mer labeled product (Fig.5 A). We found that about 20% of the Tg-containing substrate was repaired within 20 min of incubation with cell extract in comparison to 50–60% for the thymine-containing substrate (Fig. 5 B). We thus conclude that, although Tg does not completely block repair, and such lesions are to some degree repairable by BER, the inhibitory effect of Tg may cause substantial delay in the repair of clustered lesions by BER enzymes. The existence of complex DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation has been demonstrated experimentally (2Cunniffe S. O'Neill P. Radiat. Res. 1999; 152: 421-427Google Scholar, 3Sutherland B.M. Bennet P.V. Sidorkina O. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 103-108Google Scholar, 21Milligan J.R. Aguilera J.A. Nguyen T.T.D. Paglinawan R.A. Ward J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1475-1483Google Scholar). Such complex lesions may include different combinations of base lesions and/or single strand breaks. It was previously demonstrated that clustered lesions lead to the formation of mutations, deletions, and chromosome rearrangements (22Dianov G.L. Vasyunina E.A. Ovchinnikova L.P. Sinitsina O.I. Salganik R.I. Mutat. Res. 1986; 159: 41-46Google Scholar, 23Dianov G.L. Timchenko T.V. Sinitsina O.I. Kuzminov A.V. Medvedev O.A. Salganik R.I. Mol. Gen.

Wallace S.S. Radiat. Prot. Dosimetry. 2001; 97: 25-31Google Scholar); however, very little is known about the molecular events leading to such dramatic genetic changes. In this study we addressed the repair of clustered lesions containing Tg. During short-patch BER, when a single damaged nucleotide is excised by repair enzymes, the major threat may be simultaneous damage of the complementary base, and the presence of Tg in the repair gap may have a major impact on the quality and the rate of repair. Nevertheless, as we demonstrate in this study, not all BER reactions are affected to the same extent by such damages. Incision of an AP site by APE1 as well as the removal of the 5′-sugar phosphate by the AP lyase activity of Pol β were not affected at all, and Tg had only a moderate (1.5-fold) inhibitory effect on the ligation reaction. However, Tg in a repair gap significantly affected the incorporation of nucleotides by Pol β. Although the correct nucleotide (dAMP) is incorporated, the addition of the first nucleotide was significantly slowed by Tg, and further incorporation was completely blocked in repair reactions reconstituted with purified Pol β (Fig. 1 B), as well as in cell extract (Fig. 5 B, right panel). This suggests that long-patch repair, which requires incorporation of at least two nucleotides, would not be efficient in the repair of such lesions. Tg, when present on the DNA template strand, blocks the progression of replication by the major replicative DNA polymerases α and δ, although a limited incorporation opposite Tg is observed (14Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Google Scholar, 15Fischhaber P.L. Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Hatahet Z. Wallace S.S. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37604-37611Google Scholar, 26Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Google Scholar). We also found that Pol β was able to catalyze limited incorporation opposite to Tg and that Tg does not change the specificity of incorporation (Figs. 1 B and 2). In agreement with our findings, early studies indicated that Tg forms a reasonably stable base pair with adenine and that the DNA sequence immediate to Tg does not affect the specificity of incorporation by a Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I or by DNA polymerase α (14Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Google Scholar, 26Clark J.M. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5398-5403Google Scholar). Theoretically, two major known isomeric forms of Tg (5S and 5R) (27Palecek E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 139-155Google Scholar) may affect human DNA polymerases differently. In this study, Tg was generated by direct oxidation of the single thymine in the template DNA using osmium tetroxide. This procedure generates 85% of the 5R isomer (28Iwai S. Chemistry. 2001; 7: 4343-4351Google Scholar), suggesting that the reduced rate of incorporation of dAMP opposite Tg observed in our experiments was mainly due to the effect of this isomer. In support of this conclusion, kinetic analyses performed by Hanaoka and co-workers revealed that Pol α incorporates dAMP opposite 5R-Tg about 16-fold less efficiently than on an undamaged template (14Kusumoto R. Masutani C. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6090-6099Google Scholar). 8-oxoguanine and Tg are the major oxidative lesions induced by indirect effects of ionizing radiation caused by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Individually, those lesions are efficiently repaired by BER (29Dianov G. Bischoff C. Piotrowski J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33811-33816Google Scholar, 30Dianov G.L. Thybo T. Dianova I.I. Lipinski L.J. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11809-11813Google Scholar). Moreover, as we have recently shown, 8-oxoguanine within a repair gap does not inhibit short-patch BER (31Budworth H. Dianova I.I. Podust V.N. Dianov G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21300-21305Google Scholar). However, as we demonstrate here, Tg is a much more harmful lesion. When located within a cluster, Tg causes a substantial delay in short-patch BER of the opposing lesion. As a result of such a delay, gapped DNA would be exposed for a longer time to the cellular milieu. Delays in the processing of repair intermediates may cause a significant increase in genomic instability and affect cellular resistance to ionizing radiation (32Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster H.D.B. Lindahl T. Cell. 1992; 69: 495-504Google Scholar, 33Thompson L.H. West M.G. Mutat. Res. 2000; 459: 1-18Google Scholar). In summary, our data suggest that clustered lesions containing Tg are repaired slower than a single-standing lesion of a similar type and may be partially responsible for the deleterious effect of ionizing radiation.

Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Google Scholar) composed of repeating disaccharides of uronic acid (α-l-iduronic or ॆ-d-glucuronic) linked 1→4 to α-d-glucosamine. This structural complexity derives principally from the variable chemical modifications made to the polysaccharide chain. Such modifications include acetylation or sulfation at the N-position of the glucosamine, epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid, and additional O-sulfation at the 2-O-position of the uronic acid in addition to the 3-O, 6-O-position of the adjoining glucosamine. It is a highly variable sulfation pattern, in particular, which ascribes to each GAG chain a unique structural signature. In turn, this signature dictates specific GAG-protein interactions underlying critical biological processes related to cell and tissue function. Given this critical structure-function relationship of GAG sulfation, enzymes that can hydrolyze these sulfates in a structurally specific manner are important tools for the determination of GAG fine structure to better ascertain these structure-function relationships. In the previous paper (21Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Google Scholar), we described the cloning, recombinant expression, and biochemical characterization of one such sulfatase, the 2-O-sulfatase from Flavobacterium heparinum. As members of a large enzyme family, the sulfatases hydrolyze a wide array of sulfate esters (for a review, see Refs. 3Parenti G. Meroni G. Ballabio A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 386-391Google Scholar and 4von Figura K. Schmidt B. Selmer T. Dierks T. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 505-510Google Scholar). Their respective substrates include sulfated complex carbohydrates such as the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), steroids, sphingolipids, xenobiotic compounds, and amino acids such as tyrosine. Additionally, many of these enzymes are able to hydrolyze in vitro smaller synthetic substrates (e.g. 4-nitrophenyl sulfate and catechol sulfate). It is for this reason that these enzymes are often generically described as 舠arylsulfatases舡 (even when their preferred in vivo substrate is ill defined). Despite their disparate substrate specificities, the members of this enzyme family share both considerable structural homology and a common catalytic mechanism with one another (5Waldow A. Schmidt B. Dierks T. von Bulow R. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12284-12288Google Scholar). Each sulfatase possesses a signature catalytic domain toward its amino terminus, which is readily identified by the consensus sequence (C/S)XPXRXXXX(S/T)G. The conserved cysteine (or less commonly serine) within this sulfatase motif is of particular functional importance, since it is covalently modified to anl-Cα-formylglycine (l-2-amino-3-oxopropionic acid) (4von Figura K. Schmidt B. Selmer T. Dierks T. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 505-510Google Scholar, 6Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 7Dierks T. Miech C. Hummerjohann J. Schmidt B. Kertesz M.A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25560-25564Google Scholar). The ubiquitous importance of this chemical modification was first functionally identified by its relationship to the etiology of multiple sulfatase deficiency, a genetically recessive disorder in which there is a complete loss of sulfatase activity due to a lack of this critical aldehyde (FGly) within the active site of all expressed sulfatases (8Kolodny E.H.

The crystal structures of two human lysosomal sulfatases, arylsulfatase A (cerebroside-3-sulfate 3-sulfohydrolase) (9Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W.

Biol. 2001; 305: 269-277Google Scholar) and arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfate 4-sulfohydrolase) (11Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Google Scholar), and a bacterial arylsulfatase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12Boltes I. Czapinska H. Kahnert A. von Bulow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 483-491Google Scholar) have been solved. These three sulfatases share an identical alkaline phosphatase-like structural fold (according to the Structural Classification of Proteins Database) 2The Structural Classification of Proteins Database is available on the World Wide Web at scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/. composed of a series of mixed parallel and antiparallel ॆ-strands flanked by long and short α-helices on either side (9Lukatela G.

Kahnert A. von Bulow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 483-491Google Scholar). In addition to their common structural fold, these sulfatase structures also possess a high degree of homology within their respective active sites, especially in the region localized around the modified cysteine (FGly). Taken together, these crystal structures present a clear and consistent description of conserved active site residues and their potential catalytic role in sulfate ester hydrolysis. At the same time, this strong structural homology is somewhat surprising, considering that at least two of these sulfatases act on notably different substrates (e.g. sulfated sphingolipid versus sulfated GAG). The structural basis for substrate specificity, therefore, remains to be determined. The question of this relationship of enzyme active site structure to substrate specificity would appear to be especially relevant to GAGs where multiple sulfate esters are present. Using the strong structural and functional similarities that have been observed among the members of the sulfatase family of enzymes, we extend our characterization of the recombinant 2-O-sulfatase in this paper to include a structure-function description of the enzyme's substrate specificity. To do so, we first constructed a homology-based structural model for the wild type 2-O-sulfatase using the three crystal structures (cited above) as a molecular scaffold. From this model, we present a picture of the enzyme active site from which we have identified specific residues likely to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Predictions concerning substrate discrimination made from this model are supported by the biochemical and kinetic data presented in the previous paper. In addition, a specific prediction regarding the sulfatase's exolytic mode of action is made; this prediction is subsequently validated by the biochemical data. Finally, we use a combination of aldehyde-specific chemical labeling and peptide mapping methods in parallel with site-directed mutagenesis to identify the predicted active site cysteine, which is covalently modified to a formylglycine. The unsaturated heparin decasaccharide ΔU2SHNS,6SI2SHNS,6SI2SHNS,6SIHNAc,6SGHNS,3S,6S 3Heparin/heparan sulfate monosaccharides are abbreviated as follows: I, α-l-iduronic acid; H, glucosamine. Subscripts 2S, 3S, and 6S indicate 2-O-, 3-O-, and 6-O-sulfations, respectively. NAc and NS, N-acetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine.(AT-10) was generated by a partial heparinase digestion and purified as described (13Toida T. Hileman R.E. Smith A.E. Vlahova P.I. Linhardt R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32040-32047Google Scholar). Modified trypsin (sequencing grade) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Texas Red hydrazine was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Ellman's reagent was purchased from Pierce. Enzymes for molecular cloning and PCR were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The crystal structures of human arylsulfatase A, human arylsulfatase B, and the P. aeruginosaarylsulfatase 4Protein Data Bank accession numbers are as follows: cerebroside-3-sulfate sulfatase (1E2S);N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (1FSU); P. aeruginosa arylsulfatase (1HDH). were used to obtain a structural model for the 2-O-sulfatase enzyme. A multiple sequence alignment of the 2-O-sulfatase with different bacterial and lysosomal sulfatases was performed using ClustalW (14Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Based on this multiple sequence alignment, three model structures of 2-O-sulfatase were obtained corresponding to its alignment with the other three sulfatases. The models were constructed using the Homology module of the Insight II molecular simulations package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The side chain of the critical Cys-82, which is shown to undergo posttranslational modification in the active enzyme, was replaced by the geminal diol (Cॆ(OH)2). The potentials for the model structures were assigned using the AMBER force field (15Homans S.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9110-9118Google Scholar). The deletions in the modeled structures were closed using 200 steps of steepest descent minimization without including charges by keeping most of the structure rigid and allowing the regions close to the deletion move freely. The final refined structure was subjected to 400 steps of steepest descent minimization without including charges and 400 steps of conjugate gradient minimization including charges. Heparin-derived disaccharides with a ΔU at the nonreducing end were modeled as follows. The coordinates of the trisulfated ΔU containing disaccharide (ΔU2SHNS,6S) were obtained from the co-crystal structure of a heparinase-derived hexasaccharide with fibroblast growth factor 2 (Protein Data Bank code 1BFC). This trisulfated disaccharide structure was used as a reference to generate the structural models for other disaccharides including ΔU2SHNS, ΔU2SHNAc, and ΔU2SHNAc,6S. The coordinates of trisulfated disaccharides (I2SHNS,6S) containing iduronic acids in the 1C4 and2S0 conformations were also obtained from 1BFC. Similarly, chondroitin sulfate-derived disaccharides ΔU2SGalNAc,4S and ΔU2SGalNAc,6S were modeled using a reference structure of a chondroitin-4 sulfate disaccharide ΔUGalNAc,4S whose coordinates were obtained from its co-crystal structure with the chondroitinase B enzyme (Protein Data Bank code 1DBO). The potentials for these disaccharides were assigned using the AMBER force field modified to include carbohydrates (15Homans S.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9110-9118Google Scholar) with sulfate and sulfamate groups (16Huige C.J.M. Altona C. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 56-79Google Scholar). The orientation of the cleavable sulfate group relative to Oγ1 of the geminal diol in the active site of human arylsulfatase A and the bacterial arylsulfatase was identical as observed in their respective crystal structures. This orientation was such that one of the faces of the tetrahedral formed by the three oxygen atoms of SO3− was oriented toward Oγ1, facilitating the nucleophilic attack of the sulfur atom and the transfer of the SO3− group to Oγ1. This highly specific orientation of the sulfate group helped in positioning the disaccharide substrates relative to the active site of the 2-O-sulfatase. After fixing the orientation of the 2-O-sulfate group, the glycosidic torsion angles and exocyclic torsion angles were adjusted manually to remove unfavorable steric contacts with the amino acids in the active site. The enzyme substrate complexes were minimized using 200 steps of steepest descent followed by 400 steps of Newton-Raphson minimization including charges. Most of the enzyme was kept rigid, and only the loop regions constituting the active site were allowed to move freely. On the other hand, a force constant of 7000 kcal/mol was applied to constrain the ring torsion angles to fix the ring conformation of the disaccharides during the energy minimization. The manual positioning of the substrates was done using the Viewer module, building of the disaccharide structures from the reference structures was done using the Builder module, and the energy minimization was done using the Discover module of Insight II. The molecular cloning, recombinant expression in Escherichia coli, and subsequent purification of the 6× histidine-tagged 2-O-sulfatase by nickel affinity chromatography is as described in the preceding paper. The sulfatase was expressed as an amino-terminal truncation lacking its putative signal sequence (commonly referred to in both papers as 2-OΔ1–24). Approximately 10 ॖg of the AT-10 oligosaccharide were incubated with 100 pmol of 2-O ΔN1–24 in a 40-ॖl reaction volume at 30 °C. 15-ॖl aliquots were removed at 4 and 17 h and heat-inactivated at 95 °C. The oligosaccharide reaction products (along with 15 ॖl of a minus sulfatase control) were subjected to an exhaustive heparinase I and III digestion prior to capillary electrophoresis-based compositional analysis. Desulfation of the decasaccharide was assayed in parallel by MALDI-MS using established methods (17Rhomberg A.J. Ernst S. Sasisekharan R. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4176-4181Google Scholar). Approximately 500 ॖg of 6× histidine-tagged 2-O ΔN1–24 (wild type enzyme and C82A site-directed mutant) were lyophilized by Speed-Vac centrifugation and vigorously resuspended in 90 ॖl of denaturation buffer containing 6m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Active site aldehydes were fluorescently labeled by adding 25 ॖl of Texas Red hydrazine made up as a 10 mm stock in dimethyl formamide. Labeling was carried out for 3 h at room temperature with gentle mixing on a rotating platform. The hydrazone linkage was stabilized by the addition of 10 ॖl of a fresh 5 m sodium cyanoborohydride stock made up in 1 n NaOH. Reduction was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Unreacted fluorophore was removed by repeated acetone precipitation (added 5:1 (v/v)). Acetone was prechilled at −20 °C. Samples were chilled at −85 °C for 20 min prior to spinning in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, maximum speed, at 4 °C. Pellets were dried by Speed-Vac centrifugation. The labeled sulfatase (and unlabeled control) were proteolyzed with sequence grade-modified trypsin for 20 h at 37 °C in digestion buffer that contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 107 acetonitrile (v/v) in a 30-ॖl reaction volume. Trypsin was first reconstituted as a 2.5 mg/ml stock in 17 acetic acid and added at a 1:5 ratio (w/w) relative to the target protein. Following trypsin digestion, peptide cysteines were reduced by the addition of 50 mm dithiothreitol (50 °C under argon, 1 h). Reduced cysteines were subsequently alkylated for 30 min at 37 °C (in the dark) by the addition of 150 mm iodoacetamide, added from a 2 m stock made up in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. This reduction-alkylation cycle was repeated one more time. Molecular masses of select peptides were determined by MALDI-MS as described (18Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Liu J. Venkataraman G. Rosenberg R. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1206-1213Google Scholar) using 1 ॖl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 507 acetonitrile, 0.37 trifluoroacetic acid as a matrix. The site-directed mutant C82A was cloned by recombinant PCR using outside primers 5′-TCT AGA CAT ATG CAA ACC TCA AAA GTA GCA GCT-3′ (forward) and (5′-GT CTC GAG GAT CCT TAT TTT TTT AAT GCA TAA AAC GAA TCC-3′ (reverse) in addition to the following mutagenic primer pair: 5′-C CAG CCG CTC GCT ACA CCT TCA CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CG TGA AGG TGT AGC GAG CGG CTG G-3′ (reverse). The engineered codon change for each DNA strand is underlined. Subcloning into pET28a, recombinant expression in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), and subsequent purification by nickel chelation chromatography using the N-terminal 6× histidine purification tag are as described for 2-O Δ1–24 (previous paper (21Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Google Scholar)). Sulfatase cysteines were titrated based on molar absorptivity using Ellman's reagent (DTNB) generally as described (19Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Google Scholar). 50 ॖm 2-O-sulfatase (2-OΔN1–24) was reacted with 500 ॖm DTNB in a 1.4-ml reaction volume containing 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 5 mm EDTA. Absorbance was measured at 412 nm following a 15-min incubation at room temperature with a minus enzyme control used as a blank. For measurements made under denaturing conditions, SDS was added to a final concentration of 27. Molar extinction coefficients used were as follows: nondenaturing (minus SDS), 14,150 m−1; denaturing (27 SDS), 12,500m−1. In comparing the structures of human arylsulfatase A (9Lukatela G. Krauss N.

Biol. 2001; 305: 269-277Google Scholar), arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) (11Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 277-289Google Scholar), and a bacterial arylsulfatase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12Boltes I. Czapinska H. Kahnert A. von Bulow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 483-491Google Scholar), we observed an obvious structural homology between each of them, especially as it pertained to a conservation of critical active site residues and their spatial arrangement. By extension, most of these amino acids were likewise conserved in the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase as evident by a direct alignment of their primary sequences (Fig.1). We used this close structural relationship to construct three homology-based models for the flavobacterial 2-O-sulfatase, each one based on one of the three crystal structures examined. We ultimately chose as our representative 2-O-sulfatase structure the homology model constructed using the N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) (Fig. 2). This decision was largely based on arylsulfatase B also being a GAG desulfating enzyme. In this model, we replaced cysteine 82 with a formylglycine (FGly-82). We chose to represent FGly-82 in the hydrated state as ageminal diol (-Cॆ(OH)2), consistent with the proposed resting state (before catalysis) of the enzyme (5Waldow A. Schmidt B. Dierks T. von Bulow R. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12284-12288Google Scholar, 9Lukatela G. Krauss N. Theis K. Selmer T. Gieselmann V. von Figura K. Saenger W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3654-3664Google Scholar). In the structural model, the surface of the active site pocket is composed of many amino acids that can potentially interact with a disaccharide substrate (Fig. 3). These include Lys-107, Lys-175, Lys-238, Gln-237 and -309, Thr-104, Glu-106, and Asp-159. Lysines and glutamines are commonly occurring amino acids in heparin binding sites that interact with the sulfate and carboxylate groups of the GAG chain. Unlike the amino acids proximal to the FGly-82, these residues are not conserved in the other sulfatases that we examined (Table I, denoted in normal type), suggesting a potentially unique role of these amino acids in dictating oligosaccharide substrate specificity. This disparity is particularly true when directly comparing the 2-O-sulfatase and arylsulfatase A; many of the nonconserved amino acids in the 2-O-sulfatase are charged, whereas those in arylsulfatase A are predominantly hydrophobic. This observation is consistent with the obvious structural distinction of their respective substrates (i.e. the highly sulfated HSGAG substrates of the 2-O-sulfatase versus the long hydrophobic alkyl chains of cerebroside 3-sulfate substrate of arylsulfatase A).Table IStructure-based comparison of sulfatase active site residues2-O-Sulfatase (F. heparinum)Arylsulfatase A (human)Arylsulfatase B (human)Arylsulfatase (P. aeruginosa)Cys-82Cys-69Cys-91Cys-51Arg-86Arg-73Arg-95Arg-55Lys-134Lys-123Lys-145Lys-113His-136His-125His-147His-115Lys-308Lys-302Lys-318Lys-375Gln-237His-229His-242His-211Asp-42Asp-29Asp-53Asp-13Gln-43Asp-30Asp-54Asp-14Asp-295Asp-281Asp-300Asp-317His-296Asn-282Asn-301Asn-318Lys-238*Tyr-230Glu-243Trp-212Lys-175*Gln-153Arg-180Pro-161Asp-159*His-151Ser-172Ala-139Thr-104*Val-91Ile-113−Glu-106Val-93Trp-115−Lys-107*Pro-94Pro-116−Gln-309*Gly-303Trp-319Ala-376Highly conserved amino acids are listed in boldface type.

Structural alignment of the modeled 2-O-sulfatase structure with the other sulfatases was obtained based on superposition of their C-α traces using the combinatorial extension algorithm (20Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Google Scholar). Regions of deletion in the structural alignment are noted with a minus sign. Upon inspection of the 2-O-sulfatase structure, several amino acids that potentially constitute the active site were identified (Table I). There are several structurally conserved basic amino acids in the proximity of FGly-82 including Arg-86, Lys-134, His-136, and Lys-308. The topology of the active site as observed in our structural model indicated that the critical FGly-82 and the basic amino acid cluster are located at the bottom of a deep pocket (Fig. 2B). Such a restrictive access to the active site would appear to impose a clear structural constraint on the substrate as it relates to the position of the 2-O-sulfate group within the oligosaccharide chain (i.e. externallyversus internally positioned) upon which the enzyme acts. We would predict from this topology that only a sulfate group present at the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide will be favorably positioned for catalysis; the juxtaposition of an internal sulfate into the active site would require a substantial bending of the oligosaccharide chain. Such chain distortion would be sterically unfavorable. Based on these constraints, therefore, we predict the sulfatase to hydrolyze 2-O-sulfates in an exclusively exolytic fashion. This exclusivity for the nonreducing end does not necessarily preclude, however, the enzyme acting on longer chain oligosaccharides (i.e. those exceeding a disaccharide in length), provided that they in fact possess sulfates at the terminal 2-OH-position. The model does suggest a likely kinetic preference for disaccharide substrates, since they would most readily diffuse into and out of this narrow active site (see enzyme-substrate structural modeling below). We addressed this important question using as a substrate the purified heparin-derived AT-10 decasaccharide ΔU2SHNS,6SI2SHNS,6SI2SHNS,6SIHNAc,6SGHNS,3S,6S. This oligosaccharide possesses a Δ4,5-unsaturated uronic acid at the nonreducing end and both externally and internally positioned 2-O-sulfates. The substrate was first exhaustively treated with the 2-O-sulfatase. The 2-O-desulfated decasaccharide was then subjected to heparinase treatment. Capillary electrophoresis-based compositional analyses indicated the disappearance of the disaccharide ΔU2SHNS,6Sby only one-third; two-thirds of this trisulfated disaccharide remained after sequential treatment with the 2-O-sulfatase and heparin lyases (Fig. 4). Loss of a single sulfate was independently determined by mass spectrometry. Sequencing analysis of the singularly desulfated product allowed us to assign the original position of the 2-O-sulfate exclusively to the uronic acid present at the nonreducing end. This result was confirmed using other oligosaccharide substrates, including tetra- and hexasaccharides containing both nonreducing end 2-O-sulfates and internal 2-O-sulfates (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly suggest a sulfatase whose hydrolytic activity proceeds in an exolytic fashion. This conclusion is supported by our model, which, given the narrow topology of the enzyme active site, predicts a strong preference for the cleavage of sulfates positioned at the nonreducing end. Since the active site can readily accommodate disaccharide substrates, we modeled several unsaturated glycosaminoglycan disaccharides as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Our choice of Δ4,5-unsaturated substrates was logical for two reasons: 1) ॆ-eliminative cleavage of a HS polysaccharide by the flavobacterial lyases that naturally occurs in vivo results in the formation of disaccharides and other small oligosaccharides, all possessing a Δ4,5-unsaturated bond at the nonreducing end uronic acid and 2) the obligatory substrate-"

Moreover, results obtained with fluorescent ceramides, brefeldin A, ATP depletion, as well as in a ceramide transport assay indicate that nitric oxide impairs the traffic of ceramide from ER to Golgi apparatus.

Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Google Scholar, 3Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Google Scholar,4Radin N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 193-204Google Scholar). The mechanisms through which stimuli control Cer intracellular levels involve the regulation of multiple enzymes with different subcellular localization: sphingomyelinase, sphingomyelin-synthase, glucosylceramide synthase, Cer-synthase, ceramidase, and serine palmitoyltransferase (3Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Google Scholar, 5Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Agraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Google Scholar, 6Huwiler A.

In addition, in the same cell type, different isoforms of some of these enzymes may be present, and a single stimulus may have more than one target enzyme. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Cer interaction with multiple targets can result in different biological responses (1Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Google Scholar). A key element in defining the role of Cer in cell signaling is its hydrophobic nature, and its consequent inability to spontaneously move among different subcellular sites where the enzymes of its metabolism and its molecular targets are located. As a consequence, the biological effects of Cer may also depend on the regulation of its intracellular traffic and the presence of specific signaling pools of this bioactive sphingoid in the cell (7Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Google Scholar, 8Kolensnick R.N. Goni F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Google Scholar, 9van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Luit A.H. Caan W. Verheij M. Borst J. Bioch. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 819-824Google Scholar). The role of Cer as a mediator in signal transduction pathways governing life has also been demonstrated in cells of the nervous system (reviewed in Refs. 10Futerman A.H. Biochemistry (Engl. Trans. Biokhimiya). 1998; 63: 89-100Google Scholar, 11Ariga T. Jarvis W.D. Yu R.K. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1-16Google Scholar, 12Goswami R. Dawson G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 60: 141-149Google Scholar). In particular, recent studies indicate that, through the regulation of sphingomyelinase, sphingomyelin synthase, or serine palmitoyl transferase activities, the modulation of Cer levels in glial cells plays a fundamental role in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (13Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Google Scholar, 14Galve-Roperh I. Sanchez C. Cortes M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzman N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Google Scholar, 15Blasquez C. Gelen M.J.H. Velasco G. Guzman N. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 149-153Google Scholar, 16Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12797-12804Google Scholar). This crucial role of Cer is strongly supported by recent evidence about Cer mediation in the apoptotic and antitumoral activity of cannabinoids in gliomas (14Galve-Roperh I. Sanchez C. Cortes M.L. Gomez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzman N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Google Scholar) and Cer tumor levels inversely correlated with human astrocytoma malignancy and poor prognosis (17Riboni L. Campanella R. Bassi R. Villani R. Gaini S.M. Martinelli-Boneschi F. Viani P. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2002; 39: 105-113Google Scholar). Among the molecules that can regulate growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in different cell types, nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a key element in its role as an inter- and intra-cellular mediator of physiological and pathophysiological events in the nervous system (18Dawson T.M. Sasaki M. Gonzales-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 118: 3-11Google Scholar, 19Bredt D.S. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 577-596Google Scholar, 20Contestabile A. Brain Res. 2000; 32: 476-509Google Scholar, 21Murphy S. GLIA. 2000; 29: 1-14Google Scholar). The major enzymes responsible for NO production are the constitutive neuronal NO synthase in neurons and the inducible one in glial cells (20Contestabile A. Brain Res. 2000; 32: 476-509Google Scholar, 21Murphy S. GLIA. 2000; 29: 1-14Google Scholar). Various stimuli are able to regulate the activity and/or expression of these enzymes. Noteworthy, in both astrocytes and glioma cells, Cer is involved in cytokine-mediated NO synthase induction (22Pahan K. Sheikh F.G. Khan M. Namboodiri A.M.S. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2591-2600Google Scholar, 23Vann L.R. Twitty S. Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13275-13281Google Scholar). The role of NO in the control of glial cell growth is documented by studies demonstrating the antiproliferative action of NO in both astrocytes and glioma cell lines (24Garg U.C. Devi L. Turndorf H. Goldfrank L.R. Basinath M. Brain Res. 1992; 592: 208-212Google Scholar, 25Kurimoto M. Endo S. Hirashima Y. Hamada H. Oguchi T. Takaku A. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1999; 42: 35-44Google Scholar). Notwithstanding this evidence, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects on glial cell growth are still largely unknown. Furthermore, in some extraneural cells, recent evidence shows that NO may exert an apoptotic effect by increasing Cer level through the regulation of the metabolic pathways involved in its generation or removal (26Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Google Scholar, 27Takeda Y. Tashima M. Takahashi A. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10654-10660Google Scholar). In this study we investigate the possible involvement of Cer in the inhibitory role exerted by NO on C6 glioma cell proliferation. In particular, we focus on the effects of NO on the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of cellular Cer levels. Here, we present evidence that in C6 glioma cells NO promotes a Cer increase by inhibiting its transport, possibly vesicle-mediated, from ER to Golgi apparatus. As a consequence, newly synthesized Cer accumulates and appears to act as a mediator to the antiproliferative effect of NO. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), brefeldin A (BFA), bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA), fatty acid free-BSA, sphingomyelinase (SMase) fromStaphylococcus aureus, UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), fumonisin B1 (FB1),N-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C2-Cer),N-hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-Cer), and N-acetyl-dl-dihydrosphingosine (C2-DHCer) were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). [methyl- 3H]Thymidine (20 Ci/mmol), [3H]choline (19 Ci/mmol), [3H]serine (23 Ci/mmol),d-erythro-[3-3H]sphingosine (Sph) (19.7 Ci/mmol), [Sph-3H]C6-Cer, labeled at C-3 of the long chain base (19 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). [Sph-3H]sphingomyelin (SM) (0.4 Ci/mmol) was obtained as previously described (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar). PAPANONOate was from Alexis-Italia (Firenze, Italy). 6-((N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoyl) sphingosine (NBD-C6Cer) andN-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl) sphingosine (BODIPY-C5Cer) were from Molecular Probes Europe (Leiden, The Netherlands). High performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) silica gel plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The C6 glioma cell line was obtained from Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia (Brescia, Italy). Cells were routinely maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (DMEM plus 10% FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air. Cell viability was assessed with the trypan blue exclusion test. For proliferation assays, cells were plated in 35-mm dishes (104 cells/cm2) and maintained in DMEM plus 10% FCS for 24 h. Then, the plates were washed twice with DMEM containing 0.25% FCS and incubated for 48 h in the same medium before use as quiescent cells. Cells were then incubated in DMEM plus 10% FCS for 24 h with or without the following molecules: 100–400 μm PAPANONOate, 10 μm-1 mm cGMP, 10 μm C2-Cer or C6-Cer or C2-DHCer, and 0.25 unit/ml SMase. 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each plate 4 h before cell harvesting, and the thymidine incorporation in trichloroacetic-insoluble material was determined. Total sphingolipids of C6 glioma cells (6 × 105 cells) were labeled at equilibrium by incubating cells with 1 μCi of [3H]Sph (20 Ci/mmol) in DMEM plus 10% FCS for 24 h. At the end of incubation, the plates were washed twice with fresh medium and chased for 3 h in DMEM plus 10% FCS. [3H]Sph-labeled cells were then stimulated with 400 μm PAPANONOate in DMEM plus 10% FCS or incubated in DMEM plus 10% FCS. At different intervals, the cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and harvested, and total lipids were extracted as recently described (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar). The total lipid extract was partitioned, and the organic phase was subjected to mild alkaline methanolysis, a 1-h treatment at 37 °C with 0.1 m KOH in methanol. The methanolyzed organic phase and the aqueous phase were analyzed by HPTLC using as solvent systems chloroform/methanol/water (55:20:3, by volume) and butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1, by volume), respectively. C6 glioma cells plated at 1.5 × 104 cell/cm2in 35-mm dishes were maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10%FCS and then incubated with fresh medium containing [3H]choline (2 μCi/ml) with or without 400 μm PAPANONOate. At different pulse times, the cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and harvested, and total lipids were extracted and partitioned (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar). The organic phase was analyzed by HPTLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2, by volume) as the solvent system. C6 glioma cells plated at 1.5 × 104 cell/cm2in 35-mm dishes were maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10%FCS and then incubated with fresh medium containing [3H]serine (2 μCi/ml). In pulse experiments cells were fed with [3H]serine in the presence or absence of 400 μm PAPANONOate. In chase experiments, after a 1-h pulse with the radiolabeled compound (2 μCi/ml), the cells were submitted to a period of chase in DMEM plus 10%FCS with or without 400 μm PAPANONOate. At appropriate pulse or chase times, the cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and harvested, and total lipids were extracted and processed as previously described (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar). C6 glioma cells plated at 1.5 × 104cell/cm2 in 35-mm dishes were maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10%FCS. Stock solutions of [Sph-3H]SM, [3H]Sph, and [Sph-3H]C6-Cer in absolute ethanol were prepared and added to fresh medium. In all cases the final concentration of ethanol never exceeded 0.1% (v/v). The cells were pulsed for different times with [Sph-3H]SM (1 μCi/ml), [3H]Sph (0.3 μCi/ml), or [Sph-3H]C6-Cer (0.6 μCi/ml) with or without 400 μm PAPANONOate. To evaluate the effect of BFA and ATP depletion on [3H]Sph metabolism, the cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml BFA or 20 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 2 mm NaN3 (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar); the same conditions were maintained during the [3H]Sph pulse. At different pulse times the cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and harvested, and total lipids were extracted and processed as previously described (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar). SMases, SM synthase, and GlcCer synthase activities were assayed using as enzyme source cell homogenate (obtained by sonication in H2O three times, 10 s at 4 °C) of control and PAPANONOate-treated cells. Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) and acidic sphingomyelinase (A-SMase) were assayed using [Sph-3H]SM as substrate as previously described (29Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Stabilini A. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2000; 32: 137-145Google Scholar). The N-SMase incubation mixture contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 μm [Sph-3H]SM (0.1 μCi), and 5–20 μg of cell protein in a final volume of 25 μl. The A-SMase incubation mixture contained 200 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 μm[Sph-3H]SM (0.1 μCi), and 2–10 μg of cell protein in a final volume of 25 μl. After 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) at 4 °C. SM-synthase activity was assayed as previously described (16Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12797-12804Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The incubation mixture contained 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 nmol (0.05 μCi) of [Sph-3H]C6-Cer (as 1:1 complex with fatty acid-free BSA), and 20 μg of cell protein in a final volume of 50 μl. After 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, by volume) at 4 °C. GlcCer synthase activity was assayed as previously described (30Meivar-Levy I. Futerman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4607-4612Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The incubation mixture contained 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 10 mmMnCl2, 5 mm UDP-Glc, 2 nmol (0.05 μCi) of [Sph-3H]C6-Cer (as 1:1 complex with fatty acid-free BSA), and 15 μg of cell protein in a final volume of 50 μl. After 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, by volume) at 4 °C. In all cases, after lipid extraction and phase separation, the [3H]lipids were resolved by HPTLC as previously described (16Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12797-12804Google Scholar). Sphingosine kinase activity was assayed as described (31Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 215-223Google Scholar). Briefly, control and PAPANONOate-treated cells were washed with PBS and scraped in Sph kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 15 mm NaF, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and trypsin inhibitor). Cells were disrupted by freeze and thawing and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. An aliquot of the supernatant (20–50 μg of protein) was diluted in Sph kinase buffer, then Sph (50 μm final concentration as a 1:1 complex with fatty acid-free BSA) was added. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1 mm final concentration) containing MgCl2 (10 mm final concentration) in a final volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1m HCl, and radiolabeled sphingosine 1-phosphate was resolved by HPTLC (31Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 215-223Google Scholar). After visualization by autoradiography, the radioactive spots were scraped off from the plate and counted for radioactivity. C6 glioma cells plated at 1.5 × 104 cell/cm2 were grown on a glass coverslip and maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10%FCS. Then cells were incubated with 5 μm BODIPY-C5-Cer or NBD-C6-Cer (as 1:1 complex with fatty acid free BSA) in DMEM at 4 °C for 30 min (32Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Google Scholar). After washing (three times with DMEM plus 10%FCS and 0.34 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA), cells were incubated 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM plus 10%FCS with or without 400 μm PAPANONOate. Cells were then washed (three times with PBS) and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. The specimens were immediately observed and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-50) equipped with a fast high resolution charge-coupled device camera (Colorview 12) and a image analytical software (Analysis from Soft Imaging System GmbH). C6 glioma cells plated at 6 × 104 cell/cm2 in 100-mm dishes were maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10%FCS and then incubated for 1 h in the same medium with or without 400 μm PAPANONOate. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS at 4 °C and gently harvested in 0.75 ml of PBS. Cytosolic fractions were prepared as previously described (33Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Google Scholar) with some modifications. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. The cells were precipitated by centrifugation at 250 × g for 10 min, suspended in 4 volumes of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.25m sucrose, and homogenized by 3 cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to precipitate nuclei. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged twice at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to remove the particulate fraction completely. The supernatant obtained from the second centrifugation was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use as a cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration of the cytosolic fraction obtained was about 1.8 mg/ml. Cells plated at 6 × 104cell/cm2 in 100-mm dishes were maintained 48 h in DMEM plus 10% FCS and then incubated for 1 h with or without 400 μm PAPANONOate. To prepare semi-intact cells loaded with [3H]Cer, cells were then washed twice with DMEM plus 10% FCS and pulsed in the same medium with 1 μm[3H]Sph (1.43 μCi/dish) for 30 min. To minimize Cer utilization for complex sphingolipids, incubation was performed at 10 °C. At the end of pulse, [3H]Sph-labeled cells were incubated in the same medium containing 5 μmFB1 (an inhibitor of Cer synthase) for 15 min. Hereafter, all manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Semi-intact C6 glioma cells were prepared as previously described (33Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Google Scholar) with several modifications. In particular, cells were washed twice in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) and incubated in the same buffer for 10 min. Then, the hypotonic buffer was replaced by an isotonic one (10 mm Hepes-KOH, 115 mm KCl, pH 7.3), and the cells were rapidly, gently scraped and collected by low speed centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min with the brake off. After washing with the isotonic buffer, the pellets were resuspended in the isotonic buffer (about 120 μl/dish) and immediately used as [3H]Cer-labeled semi-intact cell preparations. With this procedure, more than 80% C6 glioma cells were trypan blue-positive. The enzymatic analysis of both precipitate and supernatant fractions showed that more than 85% lactate dehydrogenase activity was recovered in the supernatant. The protein concentration of the semi-intact cell preparations from both control and NO-treated cells was in the 1.2–1.4 mg of protein/ml range. The Cer transport assay was performed (33Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Google Scholar) by incubating [3H]Cer-labeled semi-intact cells (13 μg of protein) and the cytosol (32.5 μg of protein) in 100 μl (final volume) of a transport assay mixture containing, as final concentrations: 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, 70 mmKCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 250 μm GTP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm UDP-Glc, 0.5 mm MnCl2, an ATP-regenerating system (50 μm ATP, 2 mm creatine phosphate, 8 units/ml creatine phosphokinase), and 5 μm FB1. In some experiments, the transport assay was performed in the absence of the ATP-regenerating system or in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0, and 70 mm KCl, with or without 0.5 mm UDP-Glc. In the cytosol exchange experiments, semi-intact cells from control or NO-treated cells were incubated in the presence of the cytosol from NO-treated or control cells, respectively. Mixtures were incubated 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 780 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, by volume) and partitioned as described (33Funakoshi T. Yasuda S. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29938-29945Google Scholar). After counting the radioactivity, the organic phase was analyzed by HPTLC using as solvent system chloroform/methanol/water (55:20:3, by volume). To obtain quantitative data on the transport activities of semi-intact cells, [3H]Cer-labeled semi-intact cells were also extracted prior to the Cer transport assay, and the radioactivity associated to Cer, SM, and GlcCer was used as the background. Total protein was assayed with the Coomassie Blue-based Pierce Reagent, using BSA as standard. SM and GM3 contents were determined as previously reported (34Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Google Scholar, 35Bassi R. Viani P. Giussani P. Riboni L. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 101-104Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured according to Strorrie and Maddie (36Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-233Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting or radiochromatoscanning. Digital autoradiography of HPTLC plates was performed with a Beta-Imager 2000 (Biospace, France), and the radioactivity associated with individual lipids was determined with software provided with the instrument. The 3H-labeled sphingolipids were recognized and identified as previously described (28Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 656-682Google Scholar). Statistical significance of differences was determined by Student's t test. To investigate the effect of exogenously delivered NO on C6 glioma cell proliferation, cells were treated with different concentrations of the NO-releasing molecule PAPANONOate. In the 100–400 μm range, PAPANONOate induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 1, left panel). The maximal inhibitory effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation of about 80% was reached at 400 μm PAPANONOate. In these experimental conditions, at both 24 and 48 h after treatment with the NO donor, cell viability, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was not affected. This indicates that the effect of the NO-releasing compound on [3H]thymidine incorporation results from the inhibition of cell growth and not from toxicity. Moreover, when PAPANONOate was used after being decayed for 24 h, no effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed, indicating that the effect of PAPANONOate on C6 glioma cell proliferation was due to NO generation. As shown in Fig. 1 (right panel), dibutyryl-cGMP (the membrane-permeant analog of cGMP) administered in the 0.01–1 mm range, did not affect [3H]thymidine incorporation into proliferating glioma cells. We next evaluated the possible involvement of Cer as a mediator for the antiproliferative activity of NO in C6 glioma cells. To this purpose, we first measured intracellular Cer levels at various intervals after the administration of PAPANONOate to cells labeled to the equilibrium with [3H]Sph. In preliminary experiments, we set up the labeling conditions so as to obtain a [3H]GM3/[3H]SM ratio corresponding to that of the endogenous compounds as an index for a steady-state labeling of cell sphingolipids. As shown in Fig. 2, in these conditions, exogenously delivered NO caused a rapid and significant increase of the Cer cellular level. The maximum increase, corresponding to 167% of the control levels, was reached 4 h after NO treatment. Cer levels in NO-treated cells remained significantly higher than in controls, even after 24 h. In addition, we obtained evidence that those treatments able to increase Cer cellular levels mimicked the NO-induced cell growth inhibition (Fig. 3). In particular, the incubation of C6 cells with cell-permeable analogs C2- or C6-Cer as well as the treatment with bacterial SMase resulted in a significant reduction of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. Under the same conditions, the C2-Cer dihydro- derivative had no effect. To investigate the metabolic pathways involved in NO-induced modification of Cer levels, we first examined the effect of NO on SM degradation and biosynthesis. The possible contribution of SM degradation to the increase of Cer levels observed in NO-treated cells was evaluated in pulse experiments with [Sph-3H]SM, performed with or without PAPANONOate. After a 1-h pulse, similar values of [3H]SM and [3H]Cer were found in control and treated cells (Fig. 4, upper panel). In these conditions, [3H]Sph formed from [3H]Cer hydrolysis was 3.3% total incorporated radioactivity in control and 3.1% in treated cells, indicating that NO did not modify Cer cleavage by ceramidases. We also evaluated the effect of NO on in vitro activity of N-SMase and A-SMase. Using homogenates obtained from control or NO-treated cells as the enzyme source, and adding PAPANONOate to the homogenate of control cells, no difference was observed"
https://openalex.org/W2081264460,"In the downstream regions of stenotic vessels, cells are subjected to a vortex motion under low shear forces, and atherosclerotic plaques tend to be localized. It has been reported that such a change of shear force on endothelial cells has an atherogenic effect by inducing the expression of adhesion molecules. However, the effect of vortex-induced mechanical stress on leukocytes has not been investigated. In this study, to elucidate whether vortex flow can affect the cell adhesive property, we have examined the effect of vortex-mediated mechanical stress on integrin activation in THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line, and its signaling mechanisms. When cells are subjected to vortex flow at 400–2,000 rpm, integrin-dependent cell adhesion to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 or fibronectin increased in a speed- and time-dependent manner. Next, to examine the role of Ca2+ in this integrin activation, various pharmacological inhibitors involved in Ca2+ signaling were tested to inhibit the cell adhesion. Pretreatment of cells with BAPTA-AM, thapsigargin +NiCl2, or U-73122 (a phospholipase C inhibitor) inhibited cell adhesion induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress. We also found that W7 (a calmodulin inhibitor) blocked the cell adhesion. However, pretreatment of cells with GdCl3, NiCl2, or ryanodine did not affect the cell adhesion. These data indicate that vortex-mediated mechanical stress induces integrin activation through calmodulin and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ releases from intracellular Ca2+ stores in THP-1 cells.

The nature of blood flow patterns and shear forces within blood vessels may be very variable depending upon vessel size, shape, branching, and partial obstructions (1Turitto V.T. Hall C.L. Thromb. Res. 1998; 92 (suppl.): 25-31Google Scholar). Biomechanical forces induced within the cardiovascular system affect gene expression in cells of blood vessel walls (2Malek A.M. Gibbons G.H. Dzau V.J.

Changes of shear forces occur in bifurcated or stenotic regions where atherosclerotic regions are prone to develop. According to the multistep theory in cell transmigration, monocytes roll on the endothelial cells, interact with selectins, adhere to the endothelial cells by firm adhesion to ICAM-1 1The abbreviations used are: ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; VLA-4, very late antigen-4; PLC, phospholipase C and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and then migrate into the subendothelium (9Butcher E.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1033-1036Google Scholar). Rolling of monocytes on endothelial cells is dependent on the binding of E-selectin and sialyl Lewis X, and adhesion to the endothelium is dependent on the interaction between integrins on monocytes and adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells, such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Integrins consist of several subtypes, and each subtype is specific for each ligand. For example, α4β1 integrin, VLA-4, binds to VCAM-1, and β2 integrins bind to ICAM-1. Fibronectin, one of the extracellular matrix proteins, is also known to bind to β1 integrins, mainly to α5β1 integrin. Thus activation of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells and leukocytes is important for the cell migration process. In this study, we hypothesized that leukocyte adhesion might be increased at bifurcations and in the downstream of the restricted vessels. In normal laminar flow, it has been reported that human leukocytes respond to fluid shear stress by retracting pseudopods and down-regulation of integrins (10Moazzam F. DeLano F.A. Zweifach B.W. Schmid-Schonbein G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5338-5343Google Scholar, 11Fukuda S. Yasu T. Predescu D.N. Schmid-Schonbein G.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E13-E18Google Scholar), which is a requirement for normal passage of circulating leukocytes through the microcirculation. In the downstream of the region where the vessel lumen is partially occluded, however, a backward vortex can be observed where cells in the fluid phase are subjected to a vortex motion under low shear forces (1Turitto V.T. Hall C.L. Thromb. Res. 1998; 92 (suppl.): 25-31Google Scholar,12Ku D.N. Glagov S. Moore Jr., J.E. Zarins C.K. J. Vasc. Surg. 1989; 9: 309-316Google Scholar, 13Cao J. Rittgers S.E. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1998; 26: 190-199Google Scholar, 14Palmen D.E. van de Vosse F.N. Janssen J.D. van Dongen M.E. J. Biomech. 1994; 27: 581-590Google Scholar). Although such a change of shear force on endothelial cells can regulate the expression of adhesion molecules resulting in the progression of atherosclerosis (15Mohan S. Mohan N. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1100-C1107Google Scholar, 16Nagel T. Resnick N. Atkinson W.J. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 885-891Google Scholar), the effect of vortex-mediated mechanical stress on leukocytes has not yet been determined. If vortex-induced mechanical stress can induce cell adhesion in leukocytes, leukocytes would be more prone to attach to the endothelial lining in the turbulent flow because the residence time of leukocytes in the regions with nonlaminar flow is longer than in those with laminar flow (12Ku D.N. Glagov S. Moore Jr., J.E. Zarins C.K. J. Vasc. Surg. 1989; 9: 309-316Google Scholar, 13Cao J. Rittgers S.E. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1998; 26: 190-199Google Scholar). A variety of signaling systems are induced by a mechanosensor in endothelial cells. As a mechanosensor, stretch-activated channels have been reported to regulate Ca2+ influx induced by flow stress in cells such as endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells (17Brakemeier S. Eichler I. Hopp H. Kohler R. Hoyer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 209-218Google Scholar). There is much evidence that stretch increases intracellular Ca2+ levels (4Mo M. Eskin S.G. Schilling W.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1698-H1707Google Scholar, 17Brakemeier S. Eichler I. Hopp H. Kohler R. Hoyer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 209-218Google Scholar). Thus the importance of Ca2+ signaling in endothelial mechanotransduction has been established. However, the role of Ca2+ in cell response to the mechanical stress in leukocytes has not been examined so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of mechanical stress on integrin-dependent cell adhesion in human monocytic THP-1 cells and to elucidate the role of Ca2+ signaling involved in this process. RPMI medium was obtained from Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Fetal calf serum was purchased from Grand Cayman (British West Indies).l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Bio Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). Recombinant human soluble VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were from Genzyme/Techne (Minneapolis, MN). Fibronectin, thapsigargin, W-7, ryanodine, U-73122, bovine serum albumin, RGDS peptides, and RGES peptides were from Sigma. Anti-human α4 (VLA-4) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). GdCl3·6H2O and NiCl2·6H2O were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). BAPTA-AM was from Dojindo (Kumamoto, Japan). The monocytic cell line THP-1 was a generous gift from Dr. K. Nishida (Daiichi Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Tokyo) and was cultured in RPMI supplemented with l-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin plus 10% fetal calf serum in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell adhesion assays were carried out essentially as described (18Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Google Scholar). Briefly, polystyrene 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Costar 3595, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) were coated with 50 μl of soluble VCAM-1 (2.5 μg/ml), soluble ICAM-1 (2.5 μg/ml), or fibronectin (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, wells were blocked by incubation with 200 μl of 10 mg/ml heat-denatured bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. Control wells were filled with 10 mg/ml heat-denatured bovine serum albumin. One hundred μl of THP-1 cells suspended at a concentration of 106/ml in 10% fetal calf serum-RPMI were incubated for the indicated times in a CO2incubator at 37 °C after exposure to vortex flow by vortex machine (MS1 minishaker from IKA Works, Wilmington, NC). After incubation, nonadherent cells were removed by centrifugation (top side down) at 48 × g for 5 min. The plates were then centrifuged inversely at 80 × g for 5 min. Attached cells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with water, and 100 μl of 0.1% crystal violet in 200 mm MES (pH 6.0) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Excess dye was removed by washing with water three times, and the bound dye was solubilized with 100 μl of 10% acetic acid. The absorbance of each well at 595 nm was then measured using a multiscan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (SPECTRA classic, Tecan, Maennedorf, Austria). Each sample was assayed in triplicate. The absorbance was linear to the cell number up to OD of 1.9 (data not shown). For example, 0.05 of OD. represents adhesion of about 2,000 cells, and 0.5 of OD represents adhesion of about 25,000 cells. To determine the regulation of integrin avidity or affinity by mechanical stress mediated by vortex flow, we studied adhesion of THP-1 cells to purified adhesion molecules. Cell adhesion to soluble VCAM-1, soluble ICAM-1, and fibronectin was determined after cells were exposed to vortex flow for 5 s at 1,500 rpm to mimic vortices that may occur in the cardiovascular system (12Ku D.N. Glagov S. Moore Jr., J.E. Zarins C.K. J. Vasc. Surg. 1989; 9: 309-316Google Scholar, 13Cao J. Rittgers S.E. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1998; 26: 190-199Google Scholar, 19Soslau G. Schechner A.J. Alcasid P.J. Class R. Thromb. Res. 2000; 97: 15-27Google Scholar). Vortex-mediated mechanical stress increased adhesion of THP-1 cells to VCAM-1 and fibronectin by approximately five-fold but not to ICAM-1 (Fig. 1). Vortex-mediated cell adhesion to VCAM-1 and fibronectin increased in a speed-dependent manner (Fig.2). To show that this cell adhesion is dependent on α4β1 and α5β1 integrins, we preincubated the cells with anti-α4 antibody and RGDS peptides. Preincubation of the cells with anti-α4 antibody inhibited vortex-mediated cell adhesion to VCAM-1 by about 80%, but not with control IgG (Fig.3 A). Preincubation with RGDS, but not with REDS peptides, inhibited vortex-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 3 B). We also studied the change of β1 integrin expression on THP-1 cells induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress, but we could not find any change of the expression by flow cytometry (data not shown). These data indicate that cell adhesion in our assay depends on the interaction between integrins and their ligands and that vortex-mediated mechanical stress increased the avidity or affinity of both α4β1 and α5β1 integrins in THP-1 cells.Figure 3Time-dependent increase of vortex-induced adhesion of THP-1 cells to VCAM-1 and fibronectin.THP-1 cells were subjected to adhesion assays on VCAM-1 or fibronectin for 5 min after vortexing at 1,500 rpm for the indicated seconds. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we studied the time-dependent effect of vortex flow on cell adhesion to VCAM-1 and fibronectin. We found that vortex-mediated mechanical stress increased cell adhesion to both VCAM-1 and fibronectin quite rapidly, reaching a peak at 2–5 s of stimulation, indicating that such a brief vortex stimulation is enough to activate β1 integrin (Fig. 4). To examine reversibility of this integrin activation, cells were vortexed at 1,500 rpm for 5 s and left static for the indicated minutes. Cell adhesion to VCAM-1 or fibronectin was then determined. After the cells were left static for only 4 min, the cell adhesion induced by vortex flow was rapidly reduced to ∼50% (Fig.5), showing that this integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress is quite transient and reversible.Figure 5Vortex-induced integrin activation is transient and reversible. THP-1 cells were subjected to adhesion assays on VCAM-1 or fibronectin for 5 min after left static for the indicated minutes after vortexing at 1,500 rpm for 5 s. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements from three experiments. The value at the baseline was expressed as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Calcium signals are reported to be important for various cell responses such as integrin activation leading to cell adhesion (20van Kooyk Y. Weder P. Heije K. de Waal Malefijt R. Figdor C.G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 21-32Google Scholar). To determine whether Ca2+ is involved in integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress, we next pretreated the cells with BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2+chelator. Pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA-AM inhibited vortex-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig.6 A) and VCAM-1 (data not shown), indicating that intracellular Ca2+ is necessary for this integrin activation. To determine whether a stretch-activated Ca2+ channel, a well known sensing system for mechanical stress (17Brakemeier S. Eichler I. Hopp H. Kohler R. Hoyer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 209-218Google Scholar), or Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space is involved in integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress, we next pretreated the cells with GdCl3·6H2O, a specific stretch-activated channel inhibitor, or NiCl2·6H2O, a nonspecific Ca2+ influx inhibitor. Pretreatment of cells with these inhibitors did not affect vortex-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 6 B) or VCAM-1 (data not shown), indicating that this integrin activation does not depend on stretch-activated channels or Ca2+ influx from outside of the cells. These data indicate that Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores such as endoplasmic reticulum may play a key role for this phenomenon. Ca2+ is released from the intracellular Ca2+stores via two known channels, one sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the other sensitive to ryanodine. Therefore, to determine the mechanism of Ca2+release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, we pretreated the cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca2+-ATPase that inhibits IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (21Yellowley C.E. Jacobs C.R. Donahue H.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 402-408Google Scholar, 22Oike M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2940-2944Google Scholar). Because thapsigargin itself induces sustained elevation of intracellular calcium mediated by capacitative Ca2+ influx (23Granfeldt D. Samuelsson M. Karlsson A. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 611-617Google Scholar, 24Kuroiwa-Matsumoto M. Hirano K. Ahmed A. Kawasaki J. Nishimura J. Kanaide H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 115-123Google Scholar), we added NiCl2 to block this Ca2+ influx. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with thapsigargin and NiCl2 inhibited vortex-mediated mechanical stress-induced cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 6 B) and VCAM-1 (data not shown). We also pretreated the cells with U-73122, a specific PLC inhibitor, because mechanical stimulation of a single cell can activate PLC to elevate IP3 (25Sanderson M.J. Charles A.C. Boitano S. Dirksen E.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 173-187Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with U-73122 inhibited vortex-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin and VCAM-1 (data not shown) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 C). To examine the role of ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores, we next pretreated the cells with ryanodine, which can inhibit ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release (26Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6300-6306Google Scholar). Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with ryanodine up to 10 μm did not affect vortex-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 6 D). These data indicate that IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores plays a key role in this phenomenon. We also examined the potential role of Ca2+-calmodulin in integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress. To determine the involvement of calmodulin in integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress, we pretreated the cells with W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor, before vortexing the cells. Pretreatment of cells with W-7 inhibited vortex-mediated cell adhesion to VCAM-1 and fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7), indicating that calmodulin is also involved in integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress. In this study we have examined the effect of vortex-mediated mechanical stress on integrin-dependent cell adhesion in human monocytic THP-1 cells and have clearly shown that a brief period of vortex-mediated mechanical stress activated β1 integrin, resulting in cell adhesion to VCAM-1 and fibronectin in a transient and reversible manner. We have also shown that IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores and calmodulin are involved in this integrin activation. This mechanism might explain why atherosclerosis is prone to progress in bifurcated or stenotic regions, and this may be a novel aspect of atherosclerosis and inflammation. Most of the studies on mechanotransduction in the cardiovascular field have been done in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. The endothelial cells are normally subjected to mechanical stimuli from shear stress and from strain associated with stretch of the vessel wall. These stimuli can be detected by a mechanosensor that initiates a variety of signal transduction cascades (17Brakemeier S. Eichler I. Hopp H. Kohler R. Hoyer J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 209-218Google Scholar, 27Lansman J.B. Hallam T.J. Rink T.J. Nature. 1987; 325: 811-813Google Scholar). For example, in response to the change in shear stress the endothelium can change the gene expression of various cytokines and adhesion molecules (15Mohan S. Mohan N. Valente A.J. Sprague E.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1100-C1107Google Scholar, 16Nagel T. Resnick N. Atkinson W.J. Dewey Jr., C.F. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 885-891Google Scholar,28Tsuboi H. Ando J. Korenaga R. Takada Y. Kamiya A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 988-996Google Scholar) that would be related to the promotion of atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and inflammation. Few studies, however, have been conducted to elucidate the changes in the adhesive property of leukocytes in the vortex flow, which might be also related to the induction of atherosclerosis. Fukuda et al. (11Fukuda S. Yasu T. Predescu D.N. Schmid-Schonbein G.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E13-E18Google Scholar) have reported that human leukocytes respond to fluid shear stress by retracting pseudopods and down-regulate the integrin expression under the laminar flow condition, which would help leukocytes to run in the vessel wall. However, in the tortuous cardiovascular system, such as branching of the vessels and downstream of partially occluded vessels, leukocytes and platelets can be subjected to differing shear forces under nonlaminar flow patterns (1Turitto V.T. Hall C.L. Thromb. Res. 1998; 92 (suppl.): 25-31Google Scholar, 12Ku D.N. Glagov S. Moore Jr., J.E. Zarins C.K. J. Vasc. Surg. 1989; 9: 309-316Google Scholar, 13Cao J. Rittgers S.E. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 1998; 26: 190-199Google Scholar). In this study, therefore, we exposed cells to vortex flow in order to mimic vortices that may occur in the cardiovascular system. In the study of platelet aggregation, a stirring bar has been used to expose platelets to vortex flow (19Soslau G. Schechner A.J. Alcasid P.J. Class R. Thromb. Res. 2000; 97: 15-27Google Scholar). Because it is important to expose whole cells to vortex flow instantaneously to mimic the in vivo situation, vortexing the cells in a vortex machine would be more reasonable to stimulate the cells in vitro. Establishing an in vivo model would be more important to show the relevance of this data to in vivosituations. In previous studies, the endothelial intracellular Ca2+concentration in response to mechanical stress is biphasic, consisting of an initial transient rise that depends on Ca2+ release from IP3-sensitive stores, followed by a sustained elevation mediated by Ca2+ influx (22Oike M. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2940-2944Google Scholar, 29Geiger R.V. Berk B.C. Alexander R.W. Nerem R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1411-C1417Google Scholar, 30Helmlinger G. Berk B.C. Nerem R.M. J. Vasc. Res. 1996; 33: 360-369Google Scholar). However, in this report we have shown that Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space is not necessary for integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress on THP-1 cells. Our data also clearly indicate that IP3-dependent Ca2+release from intracellular Ca2+ stores plays a key role in this mechanism. Although the reason why only Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is required for vortex-mediated integrin activation remains unclear, it might be because of the shortness of vortex stimulation and integrin activation. Calmodulin is a Ca2+ binding protein and is reported to be important for various cell responses, such as integrin activation leading to T cell adhesion (20van Kooyk Y. Weder P. Heije K. de Waal Malefijt R. Figdor C.G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1993; 1: 21-32Google Scholar) and aggregation (31Andrews R.K. Suzuki-Inoue K. Shen Y. Tulasne D. Watson S.P. Berndt M.C. Blood. 2002; 99: 4219-4221Google Scholar). Our study clearly demonstrates that calmodulin also plays an essential role in regulating integrin activation induced by vortex-mediated mechanical stress as shown in various cell responses (32Exton J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E633-E647Google Scholar, 33Johns A. Leijten P. Yamamoto H. Hwang K. van Breemen C. Am. J. Cardiol. 1987; 59: 18A-23AGoogle Scholar). However, at present it is not clear how Ca2+ release from intracellular stores can be linked to the activation of calmodulin and integrin activation in THP-1 cells. Further studies, therefore, are required to clarify this mechanism. In this study we have not been able to identify the sensing mechanism for vortex-induced mechanical stress in THP-1 cells. There is a possibility that a mechanosensor itself is not involved in this process. The forces applied at the cell surface might be transmitted to other locations via cytoskeleton. This kind of mechanotransduction is shown in the area of mechanical stretch (34Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-599Google Scholar). Therefore, an explanation of the sensing mechanism would be required to understand this process. Further understanding of how leukocyte adhesion functions in the tortuous cardiovascular system would enhance our knowledge of the nuances of the atherosclerotic and inflammatory process and should facilitate the development of drugs to regulate the process. In summary, we have provided clear evidence that vortex-mediated mechanical stress on THP-1 cells quickly induces Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent integrin activation, and IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores is involved in its mechanism. These findings might enlighten another aspect of increased atherosclerosis at stenotic or bifurcated regions. We thank Hitomi Sagawa for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2090536060,"Laminin-1 is the major component of the embryonic basement membrane and consists of alpha1, beta1, and gamma1 chains. The expression of laminin-1 is induced in mouse F9 embryonal carcinoma cells upon differentiation into parietal endoderm through transcriptional up-regulation of the genes encoding these subunits. Here, we identified a 435-bp enhancer in the 5'-flanking region of the mouse laminin alpha1 (LAMA1) gene that activated its transcription in a differentiation-dependent manner. This enhancer was also active in PYS-2 parietal yolk sac-derived cells but not in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that it was a parietal endoderm-specific enhancer. This enhancer was also active in Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor-derived cells characterized by excessive production of laminin-1 and other basement membrane components, suggesting that EHS tumors have a transcriptional control mechanism similar to that of parietal endoderm cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift analyses revealed four protein binding sites (PBS1-PBS4) in the 435-bp region. However, these DNA-binding proteins were detected not only in parietal endoderm cells (i.e. differentiated F9 cells, PYS-2 cells, and EHS tumor-derived cells) but also in undifferentiated F9 cells and NIH/3T3 cells. Mutational analyses revealed that three of these binding sites (PBS2, PBS3, and PBS4) function synergistically to confer the parietal endoderm-specific enhancer activity. The proteins binding to PBS2 and PBS4 were identified as the Sp1/Sp3 family of transcription factors and YY1, respectively."

Changing Leu-43 to lysine abolishes the NaeI endonuclease activity and replaces it with topoisomerase and recombinase activities. Here we report the results of substituting Leu-43 with alanine, arginine, asparagine, glutamate, and histidine. Quantitating specific activities and DNA binding values for the mutant proteins determined the range of amino acids at position 43 that alter NaeI mechanism. Substituting alanine, asparagine, glutamate, and histidine for Leu-43 maintained endonuclease activity, but at a lower level. On the other hand, substituting positively charged arginine, like lysine at position 43, converted NaeI to a topoisomerase with no observable double-strand cleavage activity. The specific activities ofNaeI-43K and NaeI-43R and their relative sensitivities to salt, the topoisomerase-inhibiting drugN-[4-(9-acridinylamino)-3-methoxyphenyl]methane-sulfonamide (amsacrine) and single-stranded DNA showed that the two activities are similar. The effect of placing a positive charge at position 43 onNaeI structure was determined by measuring (forNaeI and NaeI-43K) relative susceptibilities to proteolysis, UV, circular dichroism spectra, and temperature melting transitions. The results provide evidence that a positive charge at position 43 induces dramatic changes in NaeI structure that affect both the Endo and Topo domains of NaeI. The identification of four putative DNA ligase motifs in NaeI leads us to speculate that structural changes that superimpose these motifs on the ligase structure may account for the changes in activity.

Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14918-14925Google Scholar) because they require interactions with an enhancing DNA sequence. One DNA sequence acts as enhancer to induce cleavage of the other sequence (4Conrad M. Topal M.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9707-9711Google Scholar, 5Topal M.D. Thresher R.J. Conrad M.

Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8291-8298Google Scholar) composed of two 317-amino acid polypeptides (8Holtz J.K. Topal M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27286-27290Google Scholar, 9Taron C.H. Van Cott E.M. Wilson G.G. Moran L.S. Slatko B.E. Hornstra L.J. Benner J.S. Kucera R.B. Guthrie E.P. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 155: 19-25Google Scholar) that recognize and cleave at the arrow, the DNA sequence 5′-GCC↑GGC-3′ using only Mg2+ as a cofactor. Two-site binding givesNaeI a specificity of DNA recognition ∼104-fold better than single-site-binding proteins that recognize similar sized sequences (3Yang C.C. Baxter B.K. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14918-14925Google Scholar). The two-site binding loops out intervening DNA sequences (5Topal M.D. Thresher R.J. Conrad M. Griffith J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2006-2010Google Scholar), hinting at more complicated functions than monofunctional DNA cleavage. Substituting lysine for leucine at position 43 (L43K) in NaeI endonuclease abolishes restriction endonuclease activity and in its place gives topoisomerase and recombinase activities (10Jo K. Topal M.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1817-1820Google Scholar). In addition, substitution L43K results in a preference for binding of single-stranded DNA and a sensitivity to salt and intercalative topoisomerase-inhibiting drugs, such asN-[4-(9-acridinylamino)-3-methoxyphenyl]methane-sulfonamide (amsacrine), which is lacking in restriction endonucleases but characteristic of topoisomerases (11Jo K. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10014-10018Google Scholar, 12Jo K. Topal M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4171-4175Google Scholar). NaeI position 43 is located near the C terminus of α-helix H2, which is part of the central hydrophobic core of the Endo domain (Ref. 13Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Unlike the structures of most restriction endonucleases, NaeI contains two separate domains, both of which bind DNA (14Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Ke H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 665-669Google Scholar). The N-terminal, Endo domain contains the restriction endonuclease cleavage motif found in restriction enzymes as well as repair nucleases mutH, Vsr, and λ exonuclease (14Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Ke H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 665-669Google Scholar, 15Ban C. Yang W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1526-1534Google Scholar, 16Tsutakawa S.E. Muto T. Kawate T. Jingami H. Kunishima N. Ariyoshi M.

Mathew S.V. May E.W. Craig N.L. Dyda F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1025-1034Google Scholar). The C-terminal, Topo domain contains a CAP motif also found in topoisomerases IA and II (19Berger J.M. Fass D. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7876-7881Google Scholar). Position 43 is positioned at the bottom edge of the Endo domain almost between the Endo and Topo domains and at the boundary separating the two NaeI monomers (Fig. 1) The two Leu-43 residues lie toward the center of the NaeI dimer ∼15 Å apart. The NaeI position 43 lies within a 10 amino acid region with similarity to the conserved, active-site KXDG motif for DNA ligases, RNA ligases, and RNA-capping enzymes, which together make up the nucleotidyl transferase superfamily (for discussions, see Ref. 20Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Google Scholar). Nucleotidyl transferase catalysis involves three steps. First, the ligase is activated by the formation of a covalent protein-AMP intermediate with the AMP linked to the ε-amino group of lysine by a phosphoramidate bond. The conserved lysine in the sequence KXDG forms the adenylated intermediate using the high energy cofactors ATP (generally found in eukaryotes, viruses, and Archaebacteria) and NAD+ (generally found in Eubacteria). Second, the AMP moiety is transferred from lysine to the 5′-phosphate at the nicked DNA. Finally, the DNA-free ends are joined in an enzyme-dependent reaction with loss of AMP. NaeI has leucine instead of the essential lysine at position 43 (43LXDG46). The topoisomerase activity of NaeI-43K is possibly the result of activating a cryptic ligase active site and thereby coupling restriction endonuclease cleavage with ligation. NaeI forms a covalent intermediate with a cleaved substrate (10Jo K. Topal M.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1817-1820Google Scholar), which may serve as the high energy intermediate needed for ligation, as is the case with the topoisomerases and recombinases. The amino acid that covalently linksNaeI to its DNA substrate has not been identified. There is no similarity between the folds of NaeI (13Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Google Scholar, 14Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Ke H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 665-669Google Scholar) and DNA ligase (21Subramanya H.S. Doherty A.J. Ashford S.R. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1996; 85: 607-615Google Scholar, 22Singleton M.R. Håkansson K. Timson D.J. Wigley D.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 35-42Google Scholar, 23Lee J.Y. Chang C. Song H.K. Moon J. Yang J.K. Kim H.-K. Kwon S.-T. Suh S.W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1119-1129Google Scholar, 24Odell M. Sriskanda V. Shuman S. Nikolov D.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1183-1193Google Scholar). Moreover, the KXDG-like motif inNaeI lies away from the endonuclease metal-binding site necessary for cleavage. Thus, the transformation to topoisomerase activity in L43K implies a conformational change in the ES complex that results in the KXDG-like motif lying closer to the phosphodiester scissile bond; the endonuclease fold may be altered to mimic aspects of the ligase fold found at the active sites of the DNA ligases. To learn whether lysine at position 43 is unique in its ability to giveNaeI topoisomerase activity, we substituted alanine, asparagine, glutamate, histidine, and arginine. We also substituted lysine for leucine at position 40. Alanine has a small, nonpolar, amino acid side chain. Asparagine has an uncharged, amide-bearing polar side chain. Like lysine, histidine, arginine, and glutamate all have charged, polar side chains depending on the pH. We report that alanine, asparagine, glutamate, and histidine at position 43 maintainedNaeI wild-type endonuclease activity when substituted at position 43, but with significant decreases in DNA cleavage. Substitution with arginine, however, resulted in topoisomerase activity identical to that of NaeI-43K. NaeI andNaeI-43K susceptibility to protease, UV-circular dichroism (CD) spectra, and CD temperature melting transitions were determined. The results provide the first evidence that placing a positive charge at position 43 causes a dramatic change in NaeI folding. The finding of additional putative ligase motifs within the NaeI sequence offers a possible rationale for how the conformational changes may alter NaeI activity. Escherichia coli strain CAA1 (F−e14−(mcrA −) lacY1 or D(lac)6 SupE44 galK2 galT22 mcrA rfbD1 mcrBa hsd (rk−mk +)M·MspI+) and plasmid pNEB-786, containing theNaeIR gene, were obtained from New England Biolabs. Plasmid pMAL-C2 and amylose resin were purchased from New England Biolabs. Substrate pBR322 was purchased from Promega Corp. Amsacrine, a DNA-intercalating drug that inhibits topoisomerase activity was purchased from Topogen Inc. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (oligonucleotides) were synthesized by the Nucleic Acid Core Facility at UNC. Cellulose phosphate, sp-Sepharose, and heparin resins were purchased from Sigma. Cognate (dTTTCTCGCCACGTTCGCCGGCTTTCCCCGTCAAGCT) and noncognate (dTTTCTCGCCACGTTCGAAGAATTTCCCCGTCAAGCT) oligonucleotides were annealed to their complements to yield DNA fragments, which were gel purified. The NaeIR gene was subcloned into the expression vector pMAL-C2, and site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of Clackson et al. (25Clackson T. Gussow D. Jones P.T. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR-A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 187-214Google Scholar). MutatedNaeIR genes were sequenced to confirm the mutation and ensure that no secondary mutations were generated. To express the fusion protein, pMAL-NaeI mutants (MBP·NaeI) were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and cell pellets resuspended in 4 volumes of Tris column buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1.0 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl) with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to inhibit serine proteases. The resuspended cell pellet was sonicated on ice for 1 min per 10 ml followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was subjected to amylose resin chromatography. The column was washed with column buffer containing 400 mm NaCl then equilibrated with column buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. Fusion protein was eluted in Tris column buffer containing 10 mm maltose. Maltose had no effect onNaeI and NaeI-43K activities. 43R was cloned into pNEB786 (to give pNEB786-NaeI-43R) and isolated from cells containing this plasmid. Cell extracts showed topoisomerase activity absent from extracts from cells containing pNEB786. Phosphocellulose, sp-Sepharose, and heparin columns were used for purification. Protein elution was achieved by NaCl gradients in column buffer. Fractions were assayed for topoisomerase activity. Peak fractions containing Topo activity were pooled and dialyzed with column buffer containing 50 mmNaCl after each column. Heparin fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm NaCl in column buffer for storage. NaeI-43R identity was confirmed by Western analysis using an affinity-purified antibody prepared against wild-type NaeI. The final purities of the proteins was estimated to be >90% based on optical density measurements of the protein resolved by SDS-PAGE by standard procedures. Restriction endonuclease activities relative to wild-type NaeI were determined from measurements of steady-state DNA cleavage rates. Protein concentrations were titrated while keeping reaction time (30 min) and DNA concentration (500 nm) constant. Reactions were prepared in 15-μl total volume to contain 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Substrate was cognate DNA radiolabeled with [α-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Reactions were stopped by addition of EDTA (40 nm) and glycerol (10%). Reaction products were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 540 PhosphorImager. The cleaved and uncleaved gel bands were quantified using Imagequant 5.0 from Molecular Dynamics. Single-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and annealed to complementary oligonucleotides to give probe. Protein and probe were incubated in a 20-μl volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmCaCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml). Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 20 min. Reaction products were analyzed by PAGE (6%). ApparentK D values (defined by the protein concentrations necessary to shift half the amount of probe) were determined with cognate probe. Nonspecific binding was tested using noncognate probe. Plasmid pBR322 (11.6 nm) and NaeI-43R (0.21 μm) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm NaCl (except for the assay of NaCl dependence), 5 mm MgCl2, bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml), and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. Its weak binding to DNA (12Jo K. Topal M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4171-4175Google Scholar) necessitated the relatively high concentration of NaeI-43R. The DNA binding affinity was similar to that of NaeI-43K. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS to 1%. Products were resolved on 1.0% agarose gels containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide in the gel and in the running buffer. Assays for the effects on NaeI-43R activity of single-stranded DNA, NaCl, and amsacrine varied the concentrations of these, as indicated. Trypsin (2.3 ng) was added to 7 μg ofNaeI or NaeI-43K, and 1-μg aliquots were removed at the times indicated. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and 1.0% SDS were added to the aliquots, which were then heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE (5% stacking and 15% resolving). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and photographed. NaeI andNaeI-43K were sized relative to known molecular weight proteins using chromatography through Sephacryl S-200 resin (32-cm column) pre-equilibrated with phosphate column buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1.0 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mmNaCl). Protein (50 μl at 0.1 mg/ml) was loaded and eluted at 0.15 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm and the elution volume determined. The void volume was determined using blue dextran. Chromatography was performed with a Bio-Rad Biologic Chromatography System. UV-CD spectra were measured using anApplied Photophysics PiStar-180 spectrometer. NaeI andNaeI-43K were extensively dialyzed into 10 mmphosphate, pH 7.0 (buffer conditions that showed similar specific activities to that measured using the above assay conditions). CD spectra were measured for NaeI, NaeI-43K, and buffer between wavelengths 185 nm and 260 nm at 25 °C. Buffer spectrum was subtracted from NaeI and NaeI-43K spectra. The concentrations of both NaeI andNaeI-43K were 0.1 mg/ml as determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm. CD measurements were also made at a wavelength of 208 nm while increasing the temperature from 10 to 90 °C. All of the mutants were expressed as fusions with maltose-binding protein. The effects of substitutions at position 43 were determined. DNA specific activities for each mutant were determined from the slope of the line defined by amount cleaved per amount of protein (Fig. 2). The plots of DNA cleavage versus amount of protein were reproducible and linear over the entire range of protein concentration (Fig. 2 and Table I). Substitutions with alanine, asparagine, glutamate, and histidine retained endonuclease activity. The cleavage patterns of the fusion protein mutants were identical to that of wild-type NaeI fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP·NaeI). The specific activities of the mutants, however, were reduced compared with that of MBP·NaeI. WhenNaeI-43K and -43R were expressed as protein fusions with maltose-binding protein neither restriction endonuclease activity nor topoisomerase activity was detected. NaeI, expressed from this vector, showed no topoisomerase activity. Therefore,NaeI-43K and -43R were expressed in E. coli from pNEB786 where they both demonstrated topoisomerase activities. Therefore, all of the mutants were studied as fusion proteins (MBP·NaeI-43A, −43H, −43E, −43N), except forNaeI-43K and NaeI-43R.Table IEffects of amino acid substitutions for Leu-40 and Leu-43 on endonuclease activityMutant1-aAll mutants were expressed as fusions with MBP.Sp. activityWild typeapp K DWild type(×1000)%nm1-bApparent K D is abbreviated app K D.%Wt30 ± 31-cErrors are variation from average of two determinations.

Open table in a new tab The apparent K Dvalues were determined for NaeI mutant interactions with DNA from the amount of protein necessary to shift half of the cognate DNA probe during PAGE (Fig. 3 and Table I). DNA-binding results are the average of two determinations. The apparentK D values varied significantly from wild type only for MBP·NaeI-43N, -43E, and -40K, which gave values of 125 ± 2, 225 ± 5, and 1250 ± 75 (nm), respectively. The gel-shift results show a small amount of density in the wells probably due to a small amount of aggregated protein that binds DNA. The small amount of protein in the wells is counted in the determination of relative K D values. NaeI-43K has topoisomerase activity rather than endonuclease activity, which is sensitive to salt, amsacrine, and ssDNA (10Jo K. Topal M.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1817-1820Google Scholar, 11Jo K. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10014-10018Google Scholar, 12Jo K. Topal M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4171-4175Google Scholar). Incubating similar concentrations ofNaeI-43R and NaeI-43K with pBR322 resulted in almost identical banding ladders characteristic of topoisomerase activity (Fig. 4 A). The differences between the ladders in Fig. 4 A can be attributed to small differences in specific activities between the two protein preparations. Nicking versus relaxation by NaeI-43R was assayed to determine the relative amounts of nicked versuscovalently closed, fully relaxed products produced (Fig.4 B). About half the final products were the latter.NaeI-43K results in a similar amount of nickedversus relaxed DNA (26Jo K. Topal M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2380-2384Google Scholar). The effects of varying salt concentration on the relaxation reaction were determined (Fig. 5). The optimum NaCl concentration was below 30 mm. At 210 mmsalt, relaxation was completely inhibited. The NaeI-43R mutation also made NaeI sensitive to the intercalative drug amsacrine (Fig. 5 B). Inhibition of NaeI-43R Topo activity by amsacrine was apparent at a concentration of 5 μm with near total inhibition at 10 μm. Single-stranded DNAs, containing the NaeI cognate or noncognate sites, were tested for their ability to inhibitNaeI-43R activity. Nearly complete inhibition ofNaeI-43R occurred with 10 nm ssDNA with or without cognate recognition sequence (Fig. 5, C andD). The results are identical to those forNaeI-43K. To determine the effect of a positive charge at position 43 on NaeI structure, NaeI and NaeI-43K conformations were probed using size-exclusion chromatography, limited proteolysis, and circular dichroism. NaeI-43K elutes by size-exclusion chromatography at the same volume as NaeI, indicating that it is a dimer of about 70 kDa (Fig. 6). Ultracentrifugation (27Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3531-3536Google Scholar), gel filtration (7Baxter B.K. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8291-8298Google Scholar), and crystallization (13Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Google Scholar,14Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Ke H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 665-669Google Scholar) show that the preferred structure of NaeI in solution is a dimer. Trypsin was used to probe the domain structure ofNaeI-43K relative to NaeI. The sites accessible to trypsin cleavage were clearly different between NaeI-43K and NaeI (Fig. 7).NaeI showed stable domains at molecular sizes of 16 and 19 kDa. NaeI-43K showed no stable domains and a significantly different initial banding pattern from NaeI at 5-min digestion with trypsin (Fig. 7). Additionally, NaeI was more resistant to trypsin cleavage than NaeI-43K.Figure 7Limited proteolysis of NaeI and NaeI-43K. Products of incubation of substrate protein (7 μg) with trypsin (2.3 ng) SDS-PAGE (15%) for the time intervals indicated. Gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Stable Endo and Topo domains of NaeI are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The protease digestion experiments implied conformational differences between NaeI and NaeI-43K. To confirm this, we measured the UV CD spectra of both proteins. CD measurements showed distinct differences between the CD spectra of NaeI andNaeI-43K (Fig. 8 A). Most notably, the minima between 205 and 230 nm were larger forNaeI-43K, with a distinct difference at the α-helical characteristic wavelength of 222 nm. The CD curves were reproducible and overlapped above λ of 250 nm, which indicated no significant concentration differences. CD was also used to monitor the temperature melting profiles of the two proteins to determine their relativeTm values. The thermal transition point was determined at λ of 208 nm, which is within the wavelength area where the CD values are most sensitive to protein structure (28Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Google Scholar).NaeI and NaeI-43K gave well defined melting points of 56 ± 0.3 °C and 59 ± 0.3 °C, respectively (Fig. 8 B). The melting point values are the averages of two determinations. Initial inspection of the NaeI sequence led to the discovery of a 10 amino acid sequence in NaeI with similarity to motif I of DNA ligase, the KXDG motif (10Jo K.

Visual inspection, taking into consideration the secondary structures of the DNA ligase motifs, identified three additional regions of NaeI protein sequence (Fig. 9) with similarity to three additional motifs that define the DNA ligase enzyme family (20Shuman S.

Fig. 9 shows the four ligase motifs for several of the DNA ligases and for NaeI. The NaeI amino acid sequence regions are shown at the top of Fig. 9 in bold. Amino acids in the DNA ligase motifs in the same exchange group (30Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcott B.L. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5, Suppl. 3. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar) as the corresponding amino acid in NaeI are shown inbold and underlined. Substituting lysine for leucine at position 43 abolishes NaeI endonuclease activity and replaces it with topoisomerase and recombinase activities (10Jo K. Topal M.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1817-1820Google Scholar). Alanine, arginine, asparagine, glutamate, and histidine were substituted at position 43 and lysine at position 40 and the activities of the respective N-terminal MBP fusion proteins quantitated to test the chemical characteristics that lead to topoisomerase activity. All substitutions, except arginine and lysine substituted at position 43, retained sequence-specific endonuclease activity, albeit at lower levels (TableI). Substitution of alanine at position 43 retained the most cleavage activity, whereas inserting lysine at position 40 and the negatively charged glutamate at position 43 reduced cleavage ∼33- and 100-fold, respectively. Alanine and histidine substitutions at position 43 retained wild-type levels of DNA binding. Substituting lysine for leucine at position 40 and glutamate for leucine at position 43, however, reduced DNA binding 125-fold and 23-fold, respectively. Deletion of the entire Endo domain only reduces DNA binding forNaeI 8-fold (27Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3531-3536Google Scholar) because of the strong DNA binding of the Topo domain (6Yang C.C. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9657-9664Google Scholar, 14Huai Q. Colandene J.D.

Thus, placing a charge within the core hydrophobic region of the Endo domain appears to have effects that reach beyond the local environment of the Endo domain. NaeI-43K lacks activity when expressed either as an N-terminal or as a C-terminal MBP fusion protein (not shown).NaeI-43R fused at its N terminus to MBP also lacks activity. The effect of fusion at the C terminus was not determined. When expressed without MBP, on the other hand, both mutant proteins gave identical topoisomerase activities. NaeI has endonuclease activity either when expressed alone or as an N-terminal MBP fusion protein (27Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3531-3536Google Scholar). No activity is recovered from NaeI expressed as a C-terminal fusion protein. The apparent loss of activity wh"
