https://openalex.org/W2924261515,"Rapid response to tissue damage Damaged plants are susceptible to microbial attack. In response to physical damage, plants proactively generate signal peptides to activate their immune systems. Hander et al. examined wound responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . They identified a metacaspase that releases an immunomodulatory signal peptide from its precursor form within 30 seconds of the damage. The metacaspase itself was activated by a burst of calcium released by tissue damage. Science , this issue p. eaar7486"

However, not every double-strand break resolves in a crossover event. Hinch et al. wanted to determine the rules governing DNA recombination. They developed a method to sequence individual mouse sperm and applied it to mice carrying two different alleles of a protein involved in mammalian crossovers. A high-resolution genetic map revealed the relationships between the distribution of crossovers, proteins involved in recombination, and specific factors determining whether a double-strand break becomes a crossover.

But what happens during reprogramming is not completely understood. Shakiba et al. used experimental and mathematical approaches to show that skin cells compete during reprogramming, eliminating one another as the population progresses toward the stem cell state (see the Perspective by Wolff and Purvis). The “winners” are a special class of skin cells originating from the neural crest. Cells of this type normally emerge during embryonic development and migrate into various tissues, including the skin, muscle, and nervous system. Science , this issue p. eaan0925 ; see also p. 330"

https://openalex.org/W2924676705,"Evaluation of reproductive quality of spermatozoa by standard semen analysis is often inadequate to predict ART outcome. Men may be prone to meiotic error and have higher proportion of spermatozoa with fragmented chromatin, capable of affecting the conceptus' health. In men with unexplained infertility, supplementary tests may be pivotal to gain insight into the paternal contribution to the zygotic genome. A total of 113 consenting men were included in the study, with an additional 5 donor specimens used as control. Among study participants, 87 were screened for sperm aneuploidy by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and ranked according to their increasing age. A total of 18 men were assessed by whole exome sequencing and categorized according to their reproductive outcome as either fertile or infertile. Another set of men (n = 13) had their gene expression analyzed by RNA-seq and were profiled according to their reproductive capacity. FISH revealed that the average aneuploidy rate was highest for men over-55 age group (9.6%), while men >55 had the highest average disomy for chromosomes 17(1.2%) and 18(1.3%). ART results for the entire cohort comprised 157 cycles, stratified by paternal age. The youngest age group (25-30 years) had a fertilization rate of 87.7% which decreased to 46.0% in the >55 age group. Clinical pregnancy rate was highest in the 25-30yr group (80.0%) while no pregnancies were attained in the >55 age groups. Pregnancy loss was characterized by a steadily increasing trend, highest in the 51-55 age group (50.0%). NGS was performed on a cohort of patients classified as having recurrent pregnancy loss. This cohort was classified as the infertile group (n = 10) and was compared to a control group (n = 8) consisting of patients successfully treated by ART. Eight couples in 17 ICSI cycles achieved a clinical pregnancy rate of 82.4% while 10 infertile couples treated in 21 cycles achieved a pregnancy rate of 23.8%, all resulting in pregnancy loss. DNA-sequencing on spermatozoa from these patients yielded overall aneuploidy of 4.0% for fertile and 8.6% for the infertile group (P<0.00001). In the infertile cohort, we identified 17 genes with the highest mutation rate, engaged in key roles of gametogenesis, fertilization and embryo development. RNA-seq was performed on patients (n = 13) with normal semen analyses. Five men unable to attain a pregnancy after ART were categorized as the infertile group, while 8 men who successfully sustained a pregnancy were established as the fertile control. Analysis resulted in 86 differentially expressed genes (P<0.001). Of them, 24 genes were overexpressed and 62 were under-expressed in the infertile cohort. DNA repair genes (APLF, CYB5R4, ERCC4 and TNRFSF21) and apoptosis-modulating genes (MORC1, PIWIL1 and ZFAND6) were remarkably under-expressed (P<0.001). Sperm aneuploidy assessment supported by information on gene mutations may indicate subtle dysfunctions of the spermatozoon. Furthermore, by querying noncoding RNA we may gather knowledge on embryo developmental competence of spermatozoa, providing crucial information on the etiology of unexplained infertility of the infertile male."
https://openalex.org/W2923924598,"RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is an essential enzyme responsible for the synthesis of several small noncoding RNAs, a number of which are involved in mRNA translation. Recessive mutations in POLR3A, encoding the largest subunit of Pol III, cause POLR3-related hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (POLR3–HLD), characterized by deficient central nervous system myelination. Identification of the downstream effectors of pathogenic POLR3A mutations has so far been elusive. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce the POLR3A mutation c.2554A→G (p.M852V) into human cell lines and assessed its impact on Pol III biogenesis, nuclear import, DNA occupancy, transcription, and protein levels. Transcriptomic profiling uncovered a subset of transcripts vulnerable to Pol III hypofunction, including a global reduction in tRNA levels. The brain cytoplasmic BC200 RNA (BCYRN1), involved in translation regulation, was consistently affected in all our cellular models, including patient-derived fibroblasts. Genomic BC200 deletion in an oligodendroglial cell line led to major transcriptomic and proteomic changes, having a larger impact than those of POLR3A mutations. Upon differentiation, mRNA levels of the MBP gene, encoding myelin basic protein, were significantly decreased in POLR3A-mutant cells. Our findings provide the first evidence for impaired Pol III transcription in cellular models of POLR3–HLD and identify several candidate effectors, including BC200 RNA, having a potential role in oligodendrocyte biology and involvement in the disease.

https://openalex.org/W2923139238,"Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy and highly toxic metal that contaminates air, food and water. Cadmium accumulates in several organs altering normal functions. The kidney is the major organ at risk of damage from chronic exposure to cadmium as a contaminant in food and water. This study aims to investigate the beneficial effects of OLE in renal collecting duct MCD4 cells exposed to a low dose cadmium (1 μM). In MCD4 cells cadmium caused an increase in ROS production, as well as generation of lipid droplets and reduced cell viability. Moreover, cadmium exposure led to a remarkable increase in the frequency of micronuclei and DNA double-strand breaks, assessed using the alkaline comet assay. In addition, cadmium dramatically altered cell cytoskeleton architecture and caused S-glutathionylation of actin. Notably, all cadmium-induced cellular deregulations were prevented by co-treatment with OLE, possibly due to its antioxidant action and to the presence of bioactive phytocompounds. Indeed, OLE treatment attenuated Cd-induced actin S-glutathionylation, thereby stabilizing actin filaments. Taken together, these observations provide a novel insight into the biological action of OLE in renal cells and support the notion that OLE may serve as a potential adjuvant against cadmium-induced nephrotoxicity."

In this study, we quantified and characterized missed opportunities for earlier HIV diagnosis in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Design Retrospective cohort. Methods A missed opportunity was defined as a healthcare encounter due to a clinical manifestation which may be caused by HIV infection, or is frequently present among those with HIV infection, but no HIV diagnosis followed within 30 days. We developed an algorithm to identify missed opportunities within one, three, and five years prior to diagnosis. The algorithm was applied to the BC STOP HIV/AIDS population-based cohort. Eligible individuals were ≥18 years old, and diagnosed from 2001–2014. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with missed opportunities. Results Of 2119 individuals, 7%, 12% and 14% had ≥1 missed opportunity during one, three and five years prior to HIV diagnosis, respectively. In all analyses, individuals aged ≥40 years, heterosexuals or people who ever injected drugs, and those residing in Northern health authority had increased odds of experiencing ≥1 missed opportunity. In the three and five-year analysis, individuals with a CD4 count <350 cells/mm3 were at higher odds of experiencing ≥1 missed opportunity. Prominent missed opportunities were related to recurrent pneumonia, herpes zoster/shingles among younger individuals, and anemia related to nutritional deficiencies or unspecified cause. Conclusions Based on our newly-developed algorithm, this study demonstrated that HIV-diagnosed individuals in BC have experienced several missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis. Specific clinical indicator conditions and population sub-groups at increased risk of experiencing these missed opportunities were identified. Further work is required in order to validate the utility of this proposed algorithm by establishing the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values corresponding to the incidence of the clinical indicator conditions among both HIV-diagnosed and HIV-negative populations."
https://openalex.org/W2952728533,"The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Western Africa is the largest recorded filovirus disease outbreak and led to the death of over 11,000 people. The recent EVD outbreaks (since May 2018) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has already claimed the lives of over 250 people. Tackling Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks remains a challenge. Over the years, significant efforts have been put into developing vaccines or antibody therapies which rely on an envelope glycoprotein (GP) of Zaire ebolavirus (strain Mayinga-76). Therefore, one key approach for combating EVD epidemics is to predict mutations that may diminish the effectiveness of the treatment. In a previous study we generated a watch list of potential antibody escape mutations of EBOV GP against the monoclonal antibody KZ52. Molecular modeling methods were applied to the three-dimensional experimental structure of EBOV GP bound to KZ52 to predict the effect of every possible single mutation in EBOV GP. The final watch list contained 34 mutations that were predicted to destabilize binding of KZ52 to EBOV GP but did not affect EBOV GP folding and its ability to form trimers. In this study, we expand our watch list by including three more monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes on GP, namely Antibody 100 (Ab100), Antibody 114 (Ab114) and 13F6-1-2. Our updated watch list contains 127 mutations, three of which have been seen in humans or are experimentally associated with reduced efficacy of antibody treatment. We believe mutations on this watch list require attention since they provide information about circumstances in which interventions could lose the effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2922866460,"Mass media reports can induce individual behaviour change during a disease outbreak, which has been found to be useful as it reduces the force of infection. We propose a compartmental model by including a new compartment of the intensity of the media reports, which extends existing models by considering a novel media function, which is dependent both on the number of infected individuals and on the intensity of mass media. The existence and stability of the equilibria are analyzed and an optimal control problem of minimizing the total number of cases and total cost is considered, using reduction or enhancement in the media reporting rate as the control. With the help of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, we obtain the optimal media reporting intensity. Through parameterization of the model with the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza outbreak data in the 8th Hospital of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province of China, we obtain the basic reproduction number for the formulated model with two particular media functions. The optimal media reporting intensity obtained here indicates that during the early stage of an epidemic we should quickly enhance media reporting intensity, and keep it at a maximum level until it can finally weaken when epidemic cases have decreased significantly. Numerical simulations show that media impact reduces the number of cases during an epidemic, but that the number of cases is further mitigated under the optimal reporting intensity. Sensitivity analysis implies that the outbreak severity is more sensitive to the weight α1 (weight of media effect sensitive to infected individuals) than weight α2 (weight of media effect sensitive to media items)."
https://openalex.org/W2923613909,"Background In an attempt to further improve liver allograft utilization and outcome in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), a variety of clinical scoring systems have been developed. Here we aimed to comparatively investigate the association of the Balance-of-Risk (BAR), Survival-Outcomes-Following-Liver-Transplant (SOFT), Preallocation-Survival-Outcomes-Following-Liver-Transplant (pSOFT), Donor-Risk-Index (DRI), and the Eurotransplant-Donor-Risk-Index (ET-DRI) scores with short- and long-term outcome following OLT. Methods We included 338 consecutive patients, who underwent OLT in our institution between May 2010 and November 2017. For each prognostic model, the optimal cutoff values were determined with the help of the Youden-index and their diagnostic accuracy for 90-day post OLT-mortality and major postoperative complications was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patient- and graft survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Morbidity was assessed using the Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive-Complication-Index. Results BAR, SOFT, and pSOFT performed well above the conventional AUROC-threshold of 0.70 with good prediction of early mortality. Only BAR showed AUC>0.70 for both mortality and major morbidity. With the cutoffs of 14, 31, and 22 respectively for BAR, SOFT, and pSOFT, subgroup analysis showed significant differences (p<0.001) in morbidity and mortality, length of intensive care- and hospital-stay and early allograft dysfunction rates. Five-years patient survival was inferior in the high BAR, pSOFT, and SOFT groups. Conclusions Out of all scores tested, the BAR-score had the best value in predicting both 90-day morbidity and mortality after OLT showing the highest AUCs. The pSOFT and SOFT scores demonstrated an acceptable accuracy in predicting 90-day morbidity and mortality. The used BAR, SOFT, and pSOFT cutoffs allowed the identification of patients at risk in terms of five-year patient survival. The DRI and ET-DRI scores have failed to predict recipient outcomes in the present setting."

https://openalex.org/W2924010375,"Introduction Grief among bereaved parents is known to cause psychological distress and physical illness, but knowledge concerning factors that can contribute to health promotion after bereavement is scarce. Childhood cancer remains the most common non-accidental cause of death among children in Norway. The aim of the present study was to explore if resilience factors among cancer-bereaved parents could predict whether they will be able to come to terms with their grief 2–8 years following the loss. Methods A Norwegian cross-sectional national survey was conducted among 161 cancer-bereaved parents using a study-specific questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to explore whether resilience factors predicted parents’ grief outcome 2–8 years after their loss. Results On the Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), three of the resilience factors contributed significantly in predicting whether the parents in the present study would come to terms with their grief 2–8 years after the loss their child: “Perception of self “(OR 2.08, p = .048), “Social resources” (OR 2.83, p = .008) and “Family cohesion” (OR .41, p = .025). The results showed a negative relationship between time since loss (2–6 years) and whether the parents answered that they had come to terms with their grief (p = < .05). The loss of a parent (OR .30, p = .030) combined with the loss of their child had a negative and significant effect on whether they indicated that they had processed their grief. Conclusion The total score of RSA and three of the six resilient factors contributed significantly in predicting whether cancer-bereaved parents in the present study indicated that they had come to terms with their grief to a great extent. The present study supports hypotheses that regard resilience as an important contribution in predicting healthy outcomes in people exposed to adverse life events."

https://openalex.org/W2924337250,"Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) capable of controlling antioxidative capacity remains to be investigated. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a central molecule for cellular defense that increases antioxidative capacity. We identified a novel lncRNA named Nrf2-activating lncRNA (Nrf2-lncRNA) transcribed from an upstream region of the microRNA 122 gene (MIR122). Nrf2-lncRNA existed in the cytoplasm, suggestive of its function as a competing endogenous RNA [ceRNA, microRNA (miRNA) sponge]. Nrf2-lncRNA served as a ceRNA for polo-like kinase (Plk) 2 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21cip1) through binding of miRNA 128 and miRNA 224, inducing Plk2/Nrf2/p21cip1 complexation for Nrf2 activation in the cells under p53-activating conditions (i.e., DNA damage and serum deprivation). Nrf2-lncRNA expression was suppressed with the initiation of apoptosis, being a rheostat for cell fate determination. Nrf2-lncRNA levels correlated with the recurrence-free postsurgery survival rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, Nrf2-lncRNA promotes Plk2 and p21cip1 translation by competing for specific miRNAs and activating Nrf2 under surviving conditions from oxidative stress, implying that Nrf2-lncRNA serves as a fine-tuning rheostat for cell fate decision.-Joo, M. S., Shin, S.-B., Kim, E. J., Koo, J. H., Yim, H., Kim, S. G. Nrf2-lncRNA controls cell fate by modulating p53-dependent Nrf2 activation as an miRNA sponge for Plk2 and p21cip1."
https://openalex.org/W2924667100,"Greater rates of genetic gain can be achieved by selecting animals born to younger parents. However, little is known about the lifetime performance of dual purpose ewes (Ovis aries) that are born to primiparous ewe lambs (8 to 9 months old at breeding). This experiment investigated the effect of being born from either a ewe lamb or mixed age dam as either a single or twin on the lifetime performance of ewe progeny. Lifetime performance was measured in terms of the life time live weights of the ewes, the weight and number of lambs born and weaned, the efficiency of production (kilograms of lamb weaned / predicted pasture intake (kgDM) of the ewes), and ewe survival. The study followed the lifetime production of 17 single and 41 twin female lambs born to mature ewes (M1 and M2, respectively), and 28 single and 29 twin lambs born to ewe lambs (L1 and L2, respectively). Over their lifetime L2 ewes were lighter (P<0.05) but had similar body condition scores to the other three ewe groups. There was no difference in average progeny weaning weight or total progeny litter weaning weights between groups. The M1 ewes had the greatest longevity (P<0.05) of the four groups. Even though L2 ewes were lighter than the other three groups, this was insufficient to increase their lifetime efficiency of production (kg lamb weaned/predicted pasture consumption), relative to the other groups. These results suggest farmers could select replacements born to ewe lambs without sacrificing animal production."
https://openalex.org/W2922660904,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating monogenic, dominant, hereditary, neurodegenerative disease. HD is caused by the expansion of CAG repeats in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, IT15, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) residue in the N-terminus of the HTT protein. HD is characterized by the accumulation of mutant HTT (mHTT) in neural and somatic cells. Progressive brain atrophy occurs initially in the striatum and extends to different brain regions with progressive decline in cognitive, behavioral and motor functions. Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the brain and play an essential role in neural development and maintaining homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). There is increasing evidence supporting the involvement of astrocytes in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We have generated neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of transgenic HD monkeys as a model for studying HD pathogenesis. We have reported that NPCs can be differentiated in vitro into mature neural cells, such as neurons and glial cells, and are an excellent tool to study the pathogenesis of HD. To better understand the role of astrocytes in HD pathogenesis and discover new therapies to treat HD, we have developed an astrocyte differentiation protocol and evaluated the efficacy of RNAi to ameliorate HD phenotypes in astrocytes. The resultant astrocytes expressed canonical astrocyte-specific markers examined by immunostaining and real-time PCR. Flow cytometry (FACS) analysis showed that the majority of the differentiated NPCs (95.7%) were positive for an astrocyte specific marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Functionalities of astrocytes were evaluated by glutamate uptake assay and electrophysiology. Expression of mHTT in differentiated astrocytes induced cytosolic mHTT aggregates and nuclear inclusions, suppressed the expression of SOD2 and PGC1, reduced ability to uptake glutamate, decreased 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) response, and shifted I/V plot measured by electrophysiology, which are consistent with previous reports on HD astrocytes and patient brain samples. However, expression of small-hairpin RNA against HTT (shHD) ameliorated and reversed aforementioned HD phenotypes in astrocytes. This represents a demonstration of a novel non-human primate (NHP) astrocyte model for studying HD pathogenesis and a platform for discovering novel HD treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2923196699,"Most research on extant planktonic foraminifera has been directed towards larger species (>0.150 mm) which can be easily manipulated, counted and yield enough calcite for geochemical analyses. This has drawn attention towards the macroperforate clade and created an impression of their numerical and ecological dominance. Drawing such conclusions from the study of such “giants” is a dangerous path. There were times in the evolutionary history of planktonic foraminifera when all species were smaller than 0.1 mm and indeed numerous small taxa, mainly from the microperforate clade, have been formally described from the modern plankton. The significance of these small, obscure and neglected species is poorly characterized and their relationship to the newly discovered hyperabundant but uncharacterized lineages of planktonic foraminifera in metabarcoding datasets is unknown. To determine, who is hiding in the metabarcoding datasets, we carried out an extensive sequencing of 18S rDNA targeted at small and obscure species. The sequences of the newly characterized small and obscure taxa match many of the previously uncharacterized lineages found in metabarcoding data. This indicates that most of the modern diversity in planktonic foraminifera has been taxonomically captured, but the role of the small and neglected taxa has been severely underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2924169794,"It has long been recognized that the process of preserving biological specimens results in alterations of body shape, though detailed studies examining the degree to which morphological changes occur throughout the preservation process are lacking. We utilize geometric morphometric analyses, an increasingly common tool for examining shape variation in a wide variety of biological disciplines, to examine the effects of formalin and ethanol preservation on the body shape of 10 freshwater fish species over time: from fresh specimens to eight weeks after preservation. We found significant changes in body shape among fresh and formalin fixed specimens. Furthermore, changes in body shape continue to occur after subsequent ethanol preservation. Two fish species collected at multiple localities show significant morphological differences for a limited number of morphometric characters. However, the significance, or lack thereof, often changed inconsistently from one stage of preservation to another. We conclude that morphometric analyses would ideally be performed on fresh specimens. However, recognizing that this is not always feasible, it is important to be aware of the morphometric changes that can occur during preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2924991856,"Price inflation has outbalanced the income of residents and buyers in major post-industrial city-regions, and real estate has become an important driver of these inequalities. In a context of a resilient inflation of home values during the last two decades in the greater Paris Region, it is critical to examine housing price dynamics to get a better understanding of socioeconomic segregation. This paper aims at presenting spatial analysis of the dynamics of segregation pertaining to inflation, analyzing price and sellers and buyers data. Using interpolation techniques and multivariate analysis, the paper presents a spatial analysis of property-level data from the Paris Chamber of Notaries (1996-2012) in a GIS (159,000 transactions in suburban areas, single family homes only). Multivariate analysis capture price change and local trajectories of occupational status, i.e. changes in balance between inward and outward flows of sellers and buyers. We adopt a method that fits the fragmented spatial patterns of suburbanization. To do so, we remove the spatial bias by means of a regular 1-km spatial grid, interpolating the variables within it, using a time-distance matrix. The main results are threefold. We document the spatial patterns of professionalization (a rise of executives, intermediate occupation and employees) to describe the main trends of inward mobility in property ownership in suburbs, offsetting the outward mobility of retired persons. Second, neighborhood trajectories are related the diverging patterns of appreciation, between local contexts of accumulation with a growth of residential prices, and suburbs with declining trends. The maturity of suburbanization yields a diversified structure of segregation between the social groups, that do not simply oppose executives vs. blue collar suburbs. A follow-up research agenda is finally outlined."
https://openalex.org/W2925120209,"An estimated 10–20 million people worldwide are infected with human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), with endemic areas of infection in Japan, Australia, the Caribbean, and Africa. HTLV-1 is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1 associated myopathy/tropic spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 expresses several regulatory and accessory genes that function at different stages of the virus life cycle. The regulatory gene Tax-1 is required for efficient virus replication, as it drives transcription of viral gene products, and has also been demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Several studies have identified a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at the carboxyl terminus of Tax-1 and demonstrated the importance of this domain for HTLV-1 induced cellular transformation. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach we identified sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) as a novel interacting partner of Tax-1. Further, we demonstrated that their interaction is mediated by the Tax-1 PBM and SNX27 PDZ domains. SNX27 has been shown to promote the plasma membrane localization of glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), one of the receptor molecules of the HTLV-1 virus, and the receptor molecule required for HTLV-1 fusion and entry. We postulated that Tax-1 alters GLUT1 localization via its interaction with SNX27. We demonstrate that over expression of Tax-1 in cells causes a reduction of GLUT1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of SNX27 results in increased virion release and decreased HTLV-1 infectivity. Collectively, we demonstrate the first known mechanism by which HTLV-1 regulates a receptor molecule post-infection."

A total of 41,433 people of all ages in Brazilian urban households were interviewed. Occasional use (within the last 15 days) and continuous use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were investigated, regardless of whether this use occurred through prescription or self-medication. The main outcome was the use of at least one analgesic.The majority of the individuals were female (52.8%), aged between 20 and 59 years (57.2%), with 1 to 8 years of schooling (45.6%). The overall prevalence of analgesic use was 22.8% [95% CI: 21.4-24.2]. The use of analgesics was significantly higher among women, adults and elderly (20 years or more), highly educated individuals and respondents who referred: diagnosis of one or more chronic diseases, using three or more medications, possession of health insurance and with one or more emergency care admittances or hospitalizations within the last year. Non-opioid analgesics were the agents most used (18.5% of the sample), followed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (6.9%) and opioid analgesics (0.5%). The most commonly used drugs were metamizole (37.8% of all analgesics), paracetamol (25.3%) and diclofenac (10.7%). These drugs were used mainly to manage occasional health conditions, particularly pain.One in five Brazilians used some analgesic, especially non-opioid analgesics, to manage acute health problems such as painful conditions."

Recently, big data of written texts on the Internet has been available for analyzing collective emotion for very large scales. Although short-term reflection between collective emotion and real social phenomena has been widely studied, long-term dynamics of collective emotion has not been studied so far due to the lack of long persistent data sets. In this study, we extracted collective emotion over a 10-year period from 3.6 billion Japanese blog articles. Firstly, we find that collective emotion shows clear periodic cycles, i.e., weekly and seasonal behaviors, accompanied with pulses caused by natural disasters. For example, April is represented by high Tension, probably due to starting school in Japan. We also identified long-term memory in the collective emotion that is characterized by the power-law decay of the autocorrelation function over several months."
https://openalex.org/W2924508737,"End stage temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) is characterized by fibrillations, fissures, clefts, and erosion of the mandibular condylar cartilage. The goal of this study was to define changes in pericellular and interterritorial delineations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that occur preceding and concurrent with the development of this end stage degeneration in a murine surgical instability model. Two-photon fluorescence (TPF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy was used to evaluate TMJ-OA mediated changes in the ECM. We illustrate that TPF/SHG microscopy reconstructs the three-dimensional network of key fibrillar and micro-fibrillar collagens altered during the progression of TMJ-OA. This method not only generates spatially distinct pericellular and interterritorial delineations of the ECM but distinguishes early and end stage TMJ-OA by signal organization, orientation, and composition. Early stage TMJ-OA at 4- and 8-weeks post-injury is characterized by two structurally distinct regions containing dense, large fiber collagens and superficial, small fiber collagens rich in types I, III, and VI collagen oriented along the mesiodistal axis of the condyle. At 8-weeks post-injury, type VI collagen is locally diminished on the central and medial condyle, but the type I/III rich superficial layer is still present. Twelve- and 16-weeks post-injury mandibular cartilage is characteristic of end-stage disease, with hypocellularity and fibrillations, fissures, and clefts in the articular layer that propagate along the mediolateral axis of the MCC. We hypothesize that the localized depletion of interterritorial and pericellular type VI collagen may signify an early marker for the transition from early to end stage TMJ-OA, influence the injury response of the tissue, and underlie patterns of degeneration that follow attritional modes of failure."

We sought to quantify the distance and travel time of Malaysian population to the closest radiotherapy centre and to estimate the megavoltage unit (MV)/million population based on the regions.Data for subdistricts in Malaysia and radiotherapy services were extracted from Department of Statistics Malaysia and Directory of Radiotherapy Centres (DIRAC). Data from DIRAC were validated by direct communication with centres. Locations of radiotherapy centres, distance and travel time to the nearest radiotherapy were estimated using web mapping service, Google Map.The average distance and travel time from Malaysian population to the closest radiotherapy centre were 82.5km and 83.4mins, respectively. The average distance and travel were not homogenous; East Malaysia (228.1km, 236.1mins), Central (14.4km, 20.1mins), East Coast (124.2km, 108.8mins), Northern (42.9km, 42.8mins) and Southern (36.0km, 39.8mins). The MV/million population for the country is 2.47, East Malaysia (1.76), Central (4.19), East Coast (0.54), Northern (2.40), Southern (2.36). About 25% of the population needs to travel >100 km to get to the closest radiotherapy facility.On average, Malaysians need to travel far and long to reach radiotherapy facilities. The accessibility to radiotherapy facilities is not equitable. The disparity may be reduced by adding centres in East Malaysia and the East Coast."
https://openalex.org/W2923539861,"Nitrogen metabolism in citrus has received increased attention due to its effects on plant growth and productivity. However, little is known about the effects of nitrogen fertilization on nitrogen metabolism in young trees of citrus cultivar ‘Huangguogan’ (Citrus reticulata × Citrus sinensis). Here, genes encoding nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and asparagine synthetase (AS), represented as HgNR, HgNiR, HgGS, HgGDH, and HgAS, respectively, were cloned from Huangguogan. Deduced protein sequences were analyzed and proteins were confirmed to be localized in their respective cellular organelles. Moreover, pot-cultured ‘Huangguogan’ seedlings were fertilized with 0 (N1), 1.36 (N2), 1.81 (N3), 2.26 (N4), or 2.72 (N5) kg N/year, for 12 months. Enzyme activity and enzyme-gene expression were studied in roots, leaves, and fruits at different stages. Finally, the effects of N application rate on root activity, leaf N, soluble protein, yield, and fruit quality at the ripening stage were measured. The results showed that: 1) HgNR, HgNiR, HgGDH, and HgAS gene products were found mainly in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, while HgGS gene product was found mainly in cytoplasm and mitochondria. 2) Gene expression and enzyme activity differed among plant organs. As the root is in permanent direct contact with the soil we suggest that root gene expression and enzyme activity can be used as reference to determine N application rate. 3) Yield, fruit quality, enzyme activity, and enzyme-related gene expression were considerably lower at low than at high-N supply. However, they were all inhibited by excess nitrogen (i.e., 2.72 kg/year). Therefore, we recommend 1.81 kg N/year as the optimal N application rate for young ‘Huangguogan’ trees."
https://openalex.org/W2923584371,"Objectives This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a school garden program on children’s vegetable consumption and determinants and to gain insight into the process of the program. Methods The “Taste Garden” is a real-world nine-week school garden program developed and implemented by a local organization. A total of 350 children (149 intervention group, 201 control group) filled out questionnaires on vegetable consumption, determinants and process of the program. Additionally, teachers filled out a process evaluation questionnaire. For effect evaluation, interaction effects (time x group) were considered, using multilevel repeated measures analyses in MLwiN 3.02. Interaction effects were repeated, taking into account quality of implementation (time x implementation group). Process evaluation was descriptively assessed with SPSS 24.0. Results Overall, beside some practical concerns of teachers, the program was well perceived by teachers and children. However, an intervention effect of “The Taste Garden” was only found for knowledge (p = 0.02), with a very small effect size (0.55%). When taking into account implementation quality, only small effects were found for awareness (p between 0.005 and 0.007 and an effect size of 0.63%) and knowledge (p between 0.04 and 0.09 and an effect size of 0.65%). Cconclusions Evaluation of the real-world “Taste Garden” program, which was positively perceived by teachers, showed no effects on vegetable consumption and small effects on its determinants. Adaptations of the current format and longer follow-up periods are therefore recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2923109630,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ has been implicated as a key player in the regulation of adiponectin levels via both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. Herein, we show that PPAR-γ interacts with human antigen R (HuR) and that the PPAR-γ-HuR complex dissociates following activation of PPAR-γ by rosiglitazone, a specific ligand of PPAR-γ. This rosiglitazone-dependent dissociation of HuR from PPAR-γ leads to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HuR and its binding to the 3'-UTR of adiponectin mRNA. PPAR-γ with H321A and H447A double mutation (PPAR-γH321/447A), a mutant lacking ligand-binding activity, impaired HuR dissociation from the PPAR-γ-HuR complex, resulting in reduced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, even in the presence of rosiglitazone. Consequently, rosiglitazone up-regulated adiponectin levels by modulating the stability of adiponectin mRNA, whereas these effects were abolished by HuR ablation or blocked in cells expressing the PPAR-γH321/447A mutant, indicating that the interaction of PPAR-γ and HuR is a critical event during adiponectin expression. Taken together, the findings demonstrate a novel mechanism for regulating adiponectin expression at the posttranscriptional level and suggest that ligand-mediated activation of PPAR-γ to interfere with interaction of HuR could offer a therapeutic strategy for inflammation-associated diseases that involve decreased adiponectin mRNA stability.-Hwang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2923885827,"The role of environmental-stress gradients in driving trophic processes like grazing, has potential to shape ecosystem responses to environmental change. In subtidal seagrass systems, however, the variation in top-down processes along stress gradients are poorly understood. We deployed herbivory assays using the five most common seagrass species of Shark Bay, to determine whether herbivory pressure changed across a salinity-stress gradient from oceanic (38 PSU) to hyper-saline (51 PSU) conditions. Seagrass tissue removed from herbivory assays by fishes decreased as environmental stress increased, and herbivores consumed greater amounts of tropical seagrass species compared to the temperate species that dominate seagrass cover in Shark Bay. This heightened consumption was correlated with enriched seagrass nutrient concentrations. Our work suggests there's a fundamental relationship between trophic interactions and environmental conditions within complex marine settings. Abiotic stressors like salinity directly impact seagrass communities physiologically; however we show that salinity stressors also shift biotic interactions, indirectly influencing grazing rates and thus having a greater effect on seagrasses than physiological impacts alone. In Shark Bay where restoration efforts are being employed to address large scale loss of seagrasses, the relationship between herbivory pressure and salinity-stress could therefore prove crucial to restoration success."
https://openalex.org/W2924103986,"Adapalene (ADAP) is an important drug widely used in the topical treatment of acne. It is a third-generation retinoid and provides keratolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antiseborrhoic action. However, some topical adverse effects such as erythema, dryness, and scaling have been reported with its commercial formula. In this sense, the microencapsulation of this drug using polyesters can circumvent its topical side effects and can lead to the enhancement of drug delivery into sebaceous glands. The goal of this work was to obtain ADAP-loaded poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) microparticles prepared by a simple emulsion/solvent evaporation method. Formulations containing 10 and 20% of ADAP were successfully obtained and characterized by morphological, spectroscopic, and thermal studies. Microparticles presented encapsulation efficiency of ADAP above 98% and showed a smooth surface and spherical shape. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results presented no drug-polymer chemical bond, and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique showed a partial amorphization of the drug. ADAP permeation in the Strat-M membrane for transdermal diffusion testing was evaluated by photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) in the spectral region between 225 and 400 nm after 15 min and 3 h from the application of ADAP-loaded PCL formulations. PAS was successfully used for investigating the penetration of polymeric microparticles. In addition, microencapsulation decreased the in vitro transmembrane diffusion of ADAP."

Furthermore, it is likely that the type-I LDN structures on N-glycans are present in many cellular glycoproteins, because B3GALNT2 is ubiquitously expressed in many tissues (7Hiruma T. Togayachi A.

To date, no method for specific detection of type-I LDN has been established because of the lack of specific probes (such as lectin or antibodies) that can distinguish between type-I and type-II LDNs. In this study, our first aim was to develop a method for identifying carrier proteins. We screened various lectins and selected Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) to detect type-I LDN. By means of Lec8 cells and B3GALNT2-transfected Lec8 cells, glycopeptides captured by a WFA column were identified by a highly sensitive LC/MS-based proteomic method. Overexpression and siRNA experiments showed the possibility of existence of glycoproteins with type-I LDN N-glycan in mammalian cells, which has never been reported. The candidate glycoproteins carrying type-I LDN N-glycans were mostly intracellular glycoproteins, and our results revealed a difference in the acceptor molecule preference between B3GALNT2 and B4GALNT3 or B4GALNT4, suggesting that type-I and type-II LDN glycans perform distinct functions. To detect LDN glycans, WFA was used as reported previously (12Haji-Ghassemi O. Gilbert M. Spence J. Schur M.J. Parker M.J. Jenkins M.L. Burke J.E. van Faassen H. Young N.M. Evans S.V. Molecular basis for recognition of the cancer glycobiomarker, LacdiNAc (GalNAc[β1→4]GlcNAc), by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin.J. Biol.

Because it was not clear whether other lectins recognize type-I LDN better than WFA does, we initially employed lectin microarray analysis of whole-cell lysates prepared from HeLa cells and HeLa cells stably expressing B3GALNT2. In addition to WFA, Bauhinia purpurea lectin and Solanum tuberosum lectin recognized the glycoproteins from B3GALNT2-transfected cells, better than those from HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that these three lectins can bind to type-I LDN glycans. In agreement with these data, the cloned WFA was found to strongly bind to both type-I and type-II LDN probably because a terminal GalNAc is one of the recognition sites of WFA (12Haji-Ghassemi O.

To further investigate the carrier molecules of type-I LDN glycans, we detected glycoproteins by WFA blotting. As described above, WFA recognizes both type-I and type-II LDNs. To confirm the products of B3GALNT2 selectively, we tried to inhibit other glycosyltransferases such as B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4. Given that B3GALNT2 mainly localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 and B4GALT1 localize in the Golgi apparatus, brefeldin A (BFA), a selective inhibitor of protein transport from the ER to Golgi apparatus (14Sampath D. Varki A. Freeze H.H. The spectrum of incomplete N-linked oligosaccharides synthesized by endothelial cells in the presence of brefeldin A.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1537830): 4440-4455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to assess the activity of B3GALNT2. In the HeLa cells expressing B3GALNT2 (HeLa+B3GalNT2-GFP), amounts of WFA-binding glycoproteins increased in the presence of BFA (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 4), but the amounts of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)–binding glycoproteins did not. Indeed, siRNA-B3GALNT2 attenuated the stimulatory effect of BFA treatment, indicating that the type-I LDN glycans were synthesized by B3GALNT2 localized in the ER (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3 and 6). Moreover, most of the WFA-binding glycans were located on N-glycans because they were removed by peptide N-glycanase F (PNGaseF) (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 9) but not by endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 8). These results suggested that B3GALNT2-dependent type-I LDNs on complex type N-glycans can be recognized by WFA and their synthesis is not suppressed by inhibiting ER to Golgi protein transport (BFA(+)). To determine the function of type-I LDN, we aimed to identify the carrier glycoproteins of type-I LDN-bearing N-glycans. HeLa cells highly express B3GALNT2 but barely express B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4. 3K. Angata, T. Nakane, T. Sato, S. Furukawa, S. Tsujikawa, H. Sawaki, M. Sogabe, T. Kubota, and H.

Engineering of recombinant Wisteria floribunda agglutinin specifically binding to GalNAcβ1,4GlcNAc (LacdiNAc).Glycobiology. 2017; 27 (28549117): 743-75410.1093/glycob/cwx038Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that WFA-binding glycoproteins in HeLa cells are both LDN- and LN-carrying glycoproteins. To avoid contamination with LN-carrying glycoproteins, we used Lec8 cells, which are derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and lack the modification with Gal. Some studies have shown that Lec8 cells do not contain LDN glycans (15Do K.Y. Do S.I. Cummings R.D. Differential expression of LacdiNAc sequences (GalNAc β1–4GlcNAc-R) in glycoproteins synthesized by Chinese hamster ovary and human 293 cells.Glycobiology. 1997; 7 (9134425): 183-19410.1093/glycob/7.2.183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Kawar Z.S.

We confirmed that the RNA expression levels of B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 in our Lec8 cells were very low as compared with those of B3GALNT2 (B3GALNT2/GAPDH = 0.03, B4GALNT3/GAPDH = 0.0002, B4GALNT4/GAPDH = 0.001, data not shown). We prepared cell lysates from Lec8 cells and the Lec8 cells stably expressing B3GALNT2 tagged with the Myc peptide. As expected, B3GALNT2 expression up-regulated WFA-binding glycoproteins (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4), whereas the expression of WGA-binding glycoproteins did not change (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). In line with the WFA blotting data, the number and amounts of glycoproteins captured by WFA beads increased as evidenced by silver staining (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the capture of glycoproteins by WFA from Lec8 cells would be useful for identifying the glycoproteins carrying type-I LDN glycans. To determine the glycoproteins carrying type-I LDN on N-glycans, oligopeptides captured by WFA beads were analyzed by an LC/MS-based method (IGOT) (17Kaji H. Saito H. Yamauchi Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Lectin affinity capture, isotope-coded tagging and mass spectrometry to identify N-linked glycoproteins.Nat.

Rep. 2012; 2 (23002422): 68010.1038/srep00680Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental procedures”). We prepared samples twice, and a list of glycopeptides identified in the two experiments was generated (Table S1). As summarized in Fig. 3A, 152 glycoproteins were identified in Lec8 cells, whereas 306 glycoproteins were identified in the B3GALNT2-transfected Lec8 cells. One hundred forty glycoproteins were common for the two lists, and 166 glycoproteins were identified only in the B3GALNT2-overexpressing cells, which potentially carry type-I and not type-II LDN. Next, the characteristics of the candidate glycoproteins that carry type-I LDN in Lec8 cells were investigated by classifying them according to their cellular localization based on human Gene Ontology analysis (PANTHER v.13.1; Fig. 3, B and C). The glycoproteins that bound to the amide column (Amide(+)), which represent total glycoproteins, were mainly intracellular and plasma membrane glycoproteins. B3GALNT2 overexpression increased the amount of intracellular glycoproteins, with LDN N-glycan being more than 2-fold more abundant than that in Lec8 cells. When intercellular glycoproteins were next classified by organelles, they turned out to be mainly located in the ER or Golgi apparatus. B3GALNT2 remarkably increased the amount of the ER-associated glycoproteins that are LDN carriers (Fig. 3C), including the glycoproteins for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biogenesis and protein folding and/or refolding. All the collected data suggested that B3GALNT2 can synthesize LDN on numerous intracellular glycoproteins, which are primarily associated with the ER. Because the above finding that B3GALNT2 synthesizes LDN on N-glycans (in addition to the known synthesis on O-mannose glycans) in cells was novel, we next verified whether B3GALNT2 actually synthesizes LDN on N-glycans. The N-glycans released from WFA-captured glycopeptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 4). In Fig. 4, the obtained peak (m/z) is indicated by the number of hexose (Hex), N-acetylhexosamine (HexNAc), and deoxyhexose (dHex) units without the trimannosyl-chitobiose core (three Man and two GlcNAc residues) calculated from the mass. As presented in Fig. 4A, the peaks of N-glycans from Lec8 cells were obtained, and the intensities of major peaks were found to be similar. In contrast, B3GALNT2 expression increased the intensities of glycans (021), (031), and (041) compared with a peak of glycan (011) (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the composition of WFA-binding glycans was changed by B3GALNT2 overexpression. Because glycan (011) consisted of zero mannose units (Hex), one GlcNAc (HexNAc), and one fucose (dHex) unit on a trimannosyl-chitobiose core, this structure could be an acceptor for B3GALNT2. According to the analysis of glycopeptides in B3GALNT2-transfected cells, the frequency of glycan (021) with two HexNAc units was more than double that of glycan (011). Similarly, glycans (031) and (041) with multiple HexNAc residues increased in quantity, suggesting that the amount of the HexNAc-HexNAc structure was increased by B3GALNT2 expression (Fig. 4B). In fact, the peak of (031) was subjected to tandem MS (MS/MS) analysis, detecting the fragment ion with m/z 527.25 corresponding to the LDN fragment (data not shown). These results revealed that the WFA-captured glycopeptides contained type-I LDN glycans, which were synthesized and up-regulated upon B3GALNT2 overexpression, suggesting that the identified glycoproteins could be carrier molecules of type-I LDN in Lec8 cells. In other studies, type-II LDN glycans have been detected in the secreted glycoproteins found in conditioned media and serum samples (5Sugahara D. Tomioka A. Sato T. Narimatsu H. Kaji H. Large-scale identification of secretome glycoproteins recognized by Wisteria floribunda agglutinin: A glycoproteomic approach to biomarker discovery.Proteomics. 2015; 15 (25921242): 2921-293310.1002/pmic.201400443Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the glycoproteins identified here as type-I carriers were mainly intracellular glycoproteins (Table S1 and Fig. 4), suggesting that the type-I LDN-carrying glycoproteins differ from type-II LDN-carrying glycoproteins. To test this hypothesis, we compared the acceptor preferences between type-I LDN synthase (B3GALNT2) and type-II LDN synthase (B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4) when they were transiently expressed in cells. B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 increased the amount of WFA-binding glycoproteins in the cultured medium, in contrast to B3GALNT2 (Fig. 5A); this result confirmed the previously published findings and the above data on the transient expression as well. Conversely, B3GALNT2 up-regulated WFA-binding glycoproteins in the cell lysate as compared with the control cells, and BFA treatment further increased the amount of WFA-binding intracellular glycoproteins (Fig. 5B), confirming that B3GALNT2 has a preference for intracellular glycoproteins over extracellular glycoproteins. Although B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 also up-regulated WFA-binding intracellular glycoproteins, most of them were assumed to be secreted proteins. This is because BFA treatment, which can inhibit protein transport and secretion pathways, decreased WFA-positive signals in intracellular glycoproteins (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 7 and 8). Next, we further examined the acceptor preference toward the candidate glycoproteins for type-I LDN glycans. The WFA-captured glycoproteins in the cell lysate and cultured medium were detected by Western blotting based on candidate glycoproteins. For this comparative analysis, we selected the glycoproteins that were frequently identified by the IGOT analysis of the glycopeptides captured by WFA from B3GALNT2-transfected cells. Hypoxia up-regulated protein 1 (HYOU1) and phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class S (PIGS) are ER-resident glycoproteins associated with protein folding and/or refolding and GPI anchor biogenesis, respectively (19Easton D.P.

Adhesion G protein–coupled receptor G1 (ADGRG1) and nicastrin (NCSTN) were chosen as membrane glycoproteins and are a collagen III receptor and a component of γ-secretase, respectively (21Luo R.

In HeLa cells, all four glycoproteins in the WFA-captured fraction were up-regulated by B3GALNT2 transfection without changes in the total expression levels of the protein (Fig. 5C). In contrast, although B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 increased the amount of WFA-captured NCSTN, they did not increase the amounts of WFA-captured HYOU1, PIGS, and ADGRG1 (Fig. 5C). These results clearly indicated that the type-I LDN-carrying glycoproteins differ from type-II LDN-carrying glycoproteins because the acceptor specificity differed between type-I and type-II synthases. To obtain further evidence that the identified glycoproteins were modified by B3GALNT2 in Lec8 cells, we examined lectin-captured glycoproteins by Western blotting (Fig. 6). First, PGAP1 (GPI inositol deacylase) was chosen as an ER-associated glycoprotein (23Tanaka S. Maeda Y. Tashima Y. Kinoshita T. Inositol deacylation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins is mediated by mammalian PGAP1 and yeast Bst1p.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (14734546): 14256-1426310.1074/jbc.M313755200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), along with PIGS and HYOU1. As a plasma membrane-associated glycoprotein, LRP1 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1) was also analyzed (24Van Leuven F. Stas L. Hilliker C. Lorent K. Umans L. Serneels L. Overbergh L. Torrekens S. Moechars D. De Strooper B. Van den Berghe H. Structure of the gene (LRP1) coding for the human α2-macroglobulin receptor lipoprotein receptor-related protein.Genomics. 1994; 24 (7534747): 78-8910.1006/geno.1994.1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) because LRP1 is one of highly N-glycosylated glycoproteins. In Lec8 cells, all five proteins, PIGS, PGAP1, HYOU1, NCSTN, and LRP1, were up-regulated in the WFA-captured fractions of B3GALNT2 transfectants (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4) without an increase in the total expression of the target molecules (lanes 5 and 6), in contrast to the absence of differences (except for HYOU1) in the WGA-captured fractions (lanes 1 and 2). The reason why HYOU1 was enriched by the WGA capture is unclear. These results suggested that glycoproteins identified by IGOT-LC/MS contain type-I LDN synthesized by B3GALNT2. Next, to further assess the modification of type-I LDN N-glycans by B3GALNT2 on the identified glycoproteins, NCSTN (Fig. 7A) and LRP1 (Fig. 7B) were immunoprecipitated from Lec8 cells and from the B3GALNT2-transfected Lec8 cells, followed by lectin blotting with WFA or WGA. NCSTN and LRP1 were chosen as two highly N-glycosylated glycoproteins. WFA signals on the immunoprecipitated proteins NCSTN and LRP1 were substantial only in B3GALNT2-transfected Lec8 cells and were faint in Lec8 cells (Fig. 7,"

The present study attempted to explore the influence of the COMT polymorphism on EFs in patients with PD. Fifty-four PD patients were recruited and underwent neuropsychological assessments for three core EFs. The COMT polymorphism was genotyped using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Participants were divided into three study groups: Val homozygotes, heterozygotes, and Met homozygotes. The three COMT genotype groups had significantly different performances in set-shifting [χ2 (2, 54) = 9.717, p = 0.008] and working memory tasks [χ2 (2, 54) = 7.806, p = 0.020]. Post-hoc analyses revealed that PD Val homozygotes performed significantly poorer in the set-shifting task than did either the PD Met homozygotes (z = -2.628, p = 0.009) or PD heterozygotes (z = -2.212, p = 0.027). Our explorative results suggest that the putative level of prefrontal dopamine influenced set-shifting through a “cane-shaped” dopamine level-response relationship. Our results have clinical implications, which may influence PD treatment with dopamine in the future because the optimal dopamine level to maximize EFs may vary based on the clinical course and COMT polymorphism status. Further study recruiting a larger number of participants is needed to confirm our preliminary findings."

https://openalex.org/W2923589620,"Hazard perception is crucial for identifying potential hazards on the road, and how quick drivers can respond to the hazard partially relies on their risk rating of the hazard after they detect it. Although many studies have attempted to reveal the relationship between drivers’ response latencies and their risk ratings, this relationship has not been extensively explored under different hazard types. The present study addresses this issue using a video-based hazard perception task. Forty novice drivers and 35 experienced drivers were recruited and 26 video clips containing either an overt hazard (continuous visibility) or a covert hazard (interrupted visibility) were shown to participants. Participants were asked to finish the hazard perception task first and then rated the risk level of the hazard when each video clip was replayed. Participants’ confidence in their answers for risk ratings was also determined. Results showed that experienced drivers responded to overt and covert hazards faster than did novice drivers. A negative and significant correlation was found between drivers’ risk ratings of covert hazards and their response latencies. Such a relationship was not found for overt hazards. More importantly, drivers rated the risk level of covert hazards higher than that of overt hazards, and higher risk ratings of covert hazards resulted in faster responses to these hazards. The findings of the present study indicate that hazard types not only influence drivers’ risk ratings and response latencies but also determine their relationships."

Sociodemographic and anthropometric variables, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities and medication were assessed by interview and medical exams. Serum-creatinine based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRcrea) and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were determined for classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The proportion of patients with adequate control of traditional risk factors (blood pressure<140/90mmHg, HbA1c<7.5%, LDL<100mg/dl) was calculated in 2892 patients with non-missing data in 9 relevant variables within each KDIGO 2012 CKD class.In the analyzed baseline data (n = 2892, 60.2% men), mean (standard deviation) values for age, DM2 duration and HbA1c were 65.3 (9.3) years, 10.3 (8.4) years and 6.9% (1.1) respectively. Of these 2892 patients, 18.7% had CKD stage 3 or higher, 25.7% had UACR≥30mg/g. Adequate blood pressure, HbA1c and LDL control was achieved in 55.7%, 78.5% and 34.4%, respectively. In 16.4% of patients (473), all three risk factors were below recommended targets. The proportion of adequate risk factor control was similar across KDIGO eGFRcrea classes. Adequate blood pressure and HbA1c control were significantly associated with lower UACR category without and with controlling for other risk factors (p<0.0001, p = 0.0002, respectively).In our study of patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, we observed a low level of risk factor control indicating potential for risk reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2923019466,"Resolution of branched DNA structures is pivotal for repair of stalled replication forks and meiotic recombination intermediates. The Yen1 nuclease cleaves both Holliday junctions and replication forks. We show that Yen1 interacts physically with Uls1, a suggested SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase that also contains a SWI/SNF-family ATPase-domain. Yen1 is SUMO-modified in its noncatalytic carboxyl terminus and DNA damage induces SUMOylation. SUMO-modification of Yen1 strengthens the interaction to Uls1, and mutations in SUMO interaction motifs in Uls1 weakens the interaction. However, Uls1 does not regulate the steady-state level of SUMO-modified Yen1 or chromatin-associated Yen1. In addition, SUMO-modification of Yen1 does not affect the catalytic activity in vitro. Consistent with a shared function for Uls1 and Yen1, mutations in both genes display similar phenotypes. Both uls1 and yen1 display negative genetic interactions with the alternative HJ-cleaving nuclease Mus81, manifested both in hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and in meiotic defects. Point mutations in ULS1 (uls1K975R and uls1C1330S, C1333S) predicted to inactivate the ATPase and ubiquitin ligase activities, respectively, are as defective as the null allele, indicating that both functions of Uls1 are essential. A micrococcal nuclease sequencing experiment showed that Uls1 had minimal effects on global nucleosome positioning/occupancy. Moreover, increased gene dosage of YEN1 partially alleviates the mus81 uls1 sensitivity to DNA damage. We suggest a preliminary model in which Uls1 acts in the same pathway as Yen1 to resolve branched DNA structures."
https://openalex.org/W2924724126,"Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is an anti-Plasmodium component of platelets. It is expressed in megakaryocytes and released from platelets following infection with Plasmodium. Innate immunity is crucial for the host anti-Plasmodium response, in which type I interferon plays an important role. Whether there is cross-talk between innate immune signaling and the production of anti-Plasmodium defense peptides is unknown. Here we demonstrate that E74, like ETS transcription factor 4 (ELF4), a type I interferon activator, can help protect the host from Plasmodium yoelii infection. Mechanically, ELF4 binds to the promoter of genes of two C-X-C chemokines, Pf4 and pro-platelet basic protein (Ppbp), initiating the transcription of these two genes, thereby enhancing PF4-mediated killing of parasites from infected erythrocytes. Elf4−/− mice are much more susceptible to Plasmodium infection than WT littermates. The expression level of Pf4 and Ppbp in megakaryocytes from Elf4−/− mice is much lower than in those from control animals, resulting in increased parasitemia. In conclusion, our study uncovered a distinct role of ELF4, an innate immune molecule, in host defense against malaria."

https://openalex.org/W2924747277,"Sphingolipids regulate several aspects of cell behavior and it has been demonstrated that cells adjust their sphingolipid metabolism in response to metabolic needs. Particularly, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a final product of sphingolipid metabolism, is a potent bioactive lipid involved in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, cell migration, actin cytoskeletal reorganization and cell adhesion. In previous work in rat renal papillae, we showed that sphingosine kinase (SK) expression and S1P levels are developmentally regulated and control de novo sphingolipid synthesis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the participation of SK/S1P pathway in the triggering of cell differentiation by external hypertonicity. We found that hypertonicity evoked a sharp decrease in SK expression, thus activating the de novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway. Furthermore, the inhibition of SK activity evoked a relaxation of cell-cell adherens junction (AJ) with accumulation of the AJ complex (E-cadherin/β-catenin/α-catenin) in the Golgi complex, preventing the acquisition of the differentiated cell phenotype. This phenotype alteration was a consequence of a sphingolipid misbalance with an increase in ceramide levels. Moreover, we found that SNAI1 and SNAI2 were located in the cell nucleus with impairment of cell differentiation induced by SK inhibition, a fact that is considered a biochemical marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. So, we suggest that the expression and activity of SK1, but not SK2, act as a control system, allowing epithelial cells to synchronize the various branches of sphingolipid metabolism for an adequate cell differentiation program."

As results, the resistance (R) after infiltration significantly decreased compared to the initial resistance. At 50 kHz, the resistances were 498.2±79.3 [Ω] before infiltration and 369.4±85.6 [Ω] after infiltration. The magnitude of the reactance (XC) decreased after infiltration. At 50 kHz, the measured reactance was -31.1±8.3 [Ω] before infiltration and -24.5±5.9 [Ω] after infiltration. The data points plotted in the R-XC graph shifted from the first quadrant before infiltration to third quadrant after infiltration.

Chicken embryos have two long ductus arteriosi, which anatomically differ from mammal ductus arteriosus. Each long ductus arteriosus is divided into two parts: the pulmonary artery-sided and descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosi. Although the pulmonary artery-sided and descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosi have distinct functional characteristics, such as oxygen responsiveness, the difference in their transcriptional profiles has not been investigated. We performed a DNA microarray analysis (GSE 120116 at NCBI GEO) with pooled tissues from the chicken pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus, descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus, and aorta at the internal pipping stage. Although several known ductus arteriosus-dominant genes such as tfap2b were highly expressed in the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus, we newly found genes that were dominantly expressed in the chicken pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus. Interestingly, cluster analysis showed that the expression pattern of the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus was closer to that of the descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus than that of the aorta, whereas the morphology of the descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus was closer to that of the aorta than that of the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus. Subsequent pathway analysis with DAVID bioinformatics resources revealed that the pulmonary artery-sided ductus arteriosus showed enhanced expression of the genes involved in melanogenesis and tyrosine metabolism compared with the descending aorta-sided ductus arteriosus, suggesting that tyrosinase and the related genes play an important role in the proper differentiation of neural crest-derived cells during vascular remodeling in the ductus arteriosus. In conclusion, the transcription profiles of the chicken ductus arteriosus provide new insights for investigating the mechanism of ductus arteriosus closure."
https://openalex.org/W2922877482,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the third leading cause of death globally and is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible. Cigarette smoking is the major cause of COPD. Fifty percent of deaths in the COPD population are due to a cardiovascular event and it is now recognised that COPD is a risk factor for stroke. Whether COPD increases stroke severity has not been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate whether functional and histological endpoints of stroke outcomes in mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) were more severe in mice exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). 7-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to room air or CS generated from 9 cigarettes/day, 5 days/week for 2, 8 and 12 weeks. Following air or CS exposure, mice underwent tMCAO surgery with an ischaemic period of 30-40 min or sham surgery. Mice were euthanised 24 h following the induction of ischaemia and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lungs and brains collected. Mice exposed to CS for 2 weeks and subjected to a stroke had similar BALF macrophages to air-exposed and stroke mice. However, CS plus stroke mice had significantly more BALF total cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes than air plus stroke mice. Mice exposed to CS for 8 and 12 weeks had significantly greater BALF total cells, macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes than air-exposed mice, but stroke did not affect CS-induced BALF cellularity. Prior CS exposure did not worsen stroke-induced neurological deficit scores, reduced foregrip strength, infarct and oedema volumes. Collectively, we found that although CS exposure caused significant BALF inflammation, it did not worsen acute post-stroke outcomes in mice. This data suggests that while patients with COPD are at increased risk of stroke, it may not translate to COPD patients having more severe stroke outcomes."

The L6 family of proteins are known to be positive regulators of tumor growth and metastasis among various cancers. However, little is known about the L6 family member TM4SF18. We investigated the expression and localization of the TM4SF18 protein in normal human pancreas and in PDAC tissue. Utilizing immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analysis, our studies for the first time demonstrate that TM4SF18 is highly expressed in PDAC tumor epithelium. Furthermore, we identified TM4SF18 to be expressed in normal acinar tissue and weakly expressed in normal ducts. Although there is minimal expression in normal ducts, we observed increased TM4SF18 levels in preneoplastic ducts and tumor epithelium. To investigate a functional role of TM4SF18 in PDAC we developed stably-expressing inducible shRNA pancreatic cancer cell lines. Knockdown of the TM4SF18 protein led to a significant decrease in Capan-1 cell growth as measured by the MTT assay, demonstrating this molecule to be a novel regulator of PDAC. Uniquely there is no ortholog of the TM4SF18 gene in mouse or rat prompting us to seek other in vivo experimental models. Using IHC and western blot analysis, expression of TM4SF18 was confirmed in the porcine PDAC model, thus we establish an alternative model to investigate this gene. TM4SF18 represents a promising novel biomarker and therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer."

In this study, we retrospectively investigated the occurrence, geographical distribution and trend of anti-CHIKV antibodies between 2009 and 2015 in Mozambique using serum samples from febrile patients.A total of 895 serum samples collected from febrile patients for measles and rubella surveillance between 2009 and 2015 in 127 districts of Mozambique were retrospectively tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against CHIKV using a commercially available ELISA.The median age of patients was 2 years (IQR: 1-5 years) and 44.2% (395/895) of them were female. We found that 54 (6.0%) of samples were positive for anti-IgM chikungunya, and 160 (17.9%) were positive for anti-CHIKV IgG. Antibodies against CHIKV (IgM and IgG) were identified in serum throughout 2009 to 2015. While frequency of IgG antibodies was significantly higher in 2015 as compared to other years, frequency of IgM antibodies was homogeneous between 2009 and 2015. Antibodies against CHIKV were reported in all provinces and in 84 (66.1%) of the districts studied. Frequency of IgM and IgG antibodies was not significantly similar between age groups.This is the largest and longest serological screening of antibodies against CHIKV in febrile patients in Mozambique and findings from this study suggest that Mozambicans from all over the country have been silently exposed to CHIKV for several years."

One of the most influential Earth scientists of the past century, Wally made foundational discoveries about the behavior of the climate system, the chemistry and circulation of the oceans, and the carbon cycle. Although he will probably be remembered most for his prescient work on global warming, his primary quest was to unravel the secrets of how the Earth system operates.

Born in Oak Park, Illinois, on 29 November 1931, Wally attended Wheaton College in Illinois, where he met Grace Carder, his future wife of 53 years and mother of their six children. At the urging of his friend Paul Gast, he transferred to Columbia University, where he graduated in 1953. After also completing his Ph.D. in geology from Columbia in 1958, he joined the Columbia faculty. Wally spent his entire career at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.

The premise that the past holds the secrets to a unified understanding of the Earth system formed the backbone of Wally's research. He was interested in the role of oceans in ice-age cycles and abrupt climate change. Wally tackled these scientific problems by land and by sea, delving into climate records unearthed from the highest domes of the polar ice sheets to the deepest depths of the ocean.

In graduate school, Wally joined the research group of geochemist J. Laurence Kulp, where he applied novel radiocarbon dating techniques to problems in archaeology, paleoclimatology, and oceanography. The time scale for ventilation of the deep ocean was virtually unknown then; Wally would recount how it was thought that deep-sea water masses were replaced every 10,000 years or so, with each cycle of deep-water replacement forming the basis for an ice age. Wally's pioneering measurements of radiocarbon in water from depth quickly dispelled that idea, demonstrating that ventilation time scales occurred approximately every 1000 years.

Revolutionary at that time, those early radiocarbon data were too sparse to derive precise information about ocean circulation. Encouraged by physicist Henry Stommel, Wally organized the international Geochemical Ocean Section Study (GEOSECS) to systematically survey ocean chemistry. These global measurements of radiocarbon and other chemical tracers offered unprecedented insight into ocean circulation. Wally's synthesis of GEOSECS results also gave him a unique understanding of the interplay between ocean circulation and biogeochemistry that regulates the CO2 content of Earth's atmosphere. Thus, when ice-core studies revealed that the CO2 content of the atmosphere during the last ice age was substantially lower than in the preindustrial modern era, Wally was poised to define the ocean processes that could have been responsible. His two seminal 1982 papers continue to guide research on carbon-climate connections today.

Coupling knowledge of ocean processes with emerging evidence from ice cores, Wally defined the paradigm-shifting concept that the ocean-atmosphere system switched rapidly between different modes of operation in the past and may well flip again in the future. Wally, who had coined the term Great Ocean Conveyor to describe the ocean's thermohaline circulation, put his uncanny ability to intuitively distill complex problems to use once again: He warned that humans were poking an “angry climate beast” by burning fossil fuels and could push the system into another climate mode. Later in his career, Wally aimed to “fix climate.” He teamed up with Lands' End founder and climate-science philanthropist Gary Comer and then-Columbia scientist Klaus Lackner to design technology that could efficiently capture CO2 directly out of the atmosphere and thus save the world from a “bad CO2 trip.”

Field observations were central to Wally's insights into the Earth system. Interested in causes of planet-wide warmings that ended recent ice ages (as context for the current global warming), Wally and I (A.E.P.) inspected glacial landscapes in Switzerland, coastal Maine, and New Zealand. We also traversed the Taklamakan Desert of western China in a quest for clues about shifts of Earth's rain belts during a cold spell of recent centuries known as the Little Ice Age. Despite his passion for science, Wally was never too busy for a practical joke. On a long GEOSECS cruise across the North Pacific, Wally secretly molded deep abyssal clays into the shape of a brownie. After eating a real brownie himself, Wally presented this sediment brownie as a “gift” to his friend and long-time Lamont colleague Taro Takahashi. After a single bite, Taro's delight turned to disgust.

Perhaps in part because of his dyslexia, Wally enjoyed talking with people to learn and debate science. He was known for visiting the offices of colleagues to exchange ideas. Wide-ranging discussions at Lamont often closed on Friday evenings at a nearby bistro. Joined by his close friends and longtime Lamont colleagues Dorothy Peteet, George Kukla, and Dennis Kent, Wally would tell stories of how our field of science came to be, comment on the latest findings, or challenge and encourage his colleagues on their projects. When his health declined, Wally was delighted when, to his surprise, his Lamont colleagues brought the Friday “colloquia” to his apartment in Manhattan, which he shared with his wife Elizabeth Clark (also a Lamonter, whom he married after Grace's death). During his final month, he was still planning to bring together Columbia engineering colleagues who worked on carbon capture and sequestration and Lamont scientists who worked on the natural carbon cycle [including one of us (R.F.A.), who collaborated with Wally for more than 30 years)] for a seminar exploring strategies to mitigate global warming.

If there was one unifying component to Wally's expansive career, it was his reverence for Earth's natural history. The geologic record holds the clues to Earth's oceans and climate. These clues are just waiting to be decoded so that we may chart a path toward restoring a habitable planet. Such was the lifelong passion of Wally Broecker, always seeking answers to Earth's greatest puzzles.
