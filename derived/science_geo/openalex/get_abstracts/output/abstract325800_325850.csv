https://openalex.org/W1967829909,"Snow accumulation measured during 1982-1983 on the Quelccaya ice cap, Peru, was 70 percent of the average from 1975 through 1983. Inspection of 19 years (1964 through 1983) of accumulation measured near the summit of Quelccaya reveals a substantial decrease ( approximately 30 percent) in association with the last five El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurrences in the equatorial Pacific. The ENSO phenomenon is now recognized as a global event arising from large-scale interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. Understanding this extreme event, with the goal of prediction, requires a record of past occurrences. The Quelccaya ice cap, which contains 1500 years of annually accumulated ice layers, may provide a long and detailed record of the most extreme ENSO events."
https://openalex.org/W2059751049,"Results are presented which show that lead-iron phosphate glasses are a promising new waste form for the safe immobilization of both high-level defense and high-level commercial radioactive waste. Relative to the borosilicate nuclear waste glasses that are currently the ""reference"" waste form for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste, lead-iron phosphate glasses have several distinct advantages: (i) an aqueous corrosion rate that is about 1000 times lower, (ii) a processing temperature that is 100 degrees to 250 degrees C lower, and (iii) a much lower melt viscosity in the temperature range from 800 degrees to 1000 degrees C. Most significantly, the lead-iron phosphate waste form can be processed using a technology similar to that developed for borosilicate nuclear waste glasses."

The assay is based on the altered expression of the glucose-repressible alcohol dehydrogenase gene of yeast upon insertion of a Ty in front of this gene. By this assay the transposition rate of Ty elements was found to increase approximately 100-fold at temperatures lower than 30 degrees C, the optimum growth temperature for Saccharomyces cerevisiae."
https://openalex.org/W2029238627,"High-resolution x-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to probe the chemical and structural environments of sulfur in coal. Measurement of the sulfur Kedge spectra down to 2472.0 electron volts under nonvacuum conditions was made possible in an all-helium path, and a Stern-Heald type ion chamber was used for fluorescence detection. For a number of selected sulfur-containing minerals and organic model compounds, results show that near-edge spectral features are diagnostic for sulfur in specific organic moieties such as thiols, disulfides, and various heterocyclics, as well as in mineral sulfide and sulfate phases. The spectrum of a model system containing 35 percent iron pyrite and 65 percent benzothiophene was found to match the observed spectral features of a bituminous coal from the eastern United States."

This suggested association can account for one quarter of the total number of events seen in eight Venus years."

https://openalex.org/W2086973005,"A common and highly destructive dietary disease of silver foxes in captivity is pathologically the counter-part of Wernicke's hemorrhagic polioencephalitis of man. The disease in foxes is caused by feeding fish as 10 per cent., or more, of the diet. It is probable that the fish induce a B(1) avitaminosis which causes the characteristic pathology and the resultant symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W2006679760,"Scientists appointed by the International Council of Scientific Unions have concluded that nuclear wastes may be safely disposed of using current technology. Interim storage for 50 to 100 years greatly reduces the problem of thermal loading at the final disposal sites, but more research devoted to such interim storage is needed."

The correct figure is reproduced below. [see figure in source PDF]."
