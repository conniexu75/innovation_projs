When employed with two-dimensional electrophoresis, it should permit qualitative and quantitative characterization of protein distributions in body fluids and tissues. It has been used to demonstrate regional variations in cerebrospinal fluid proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2098001605,"The binding of monoclonal antibody specific for colon carcinoma was inhibited by serum from patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon but not by serum from patients with other bowel diseases or from healthy volunteers. Of other malignancies studied, serum from two patients with gastric carcinoma and two patients with pancreatic carcinoma also inhibited the specific binding of monoclonal antibody. The levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in these serum samples were not correlated with their levels of binding inhibition. Such monoclonal antibodies may prove useful for the detection of colorectal carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W1993667465,"A secondary structure model for 16S ribosomal RNA which is based on available chemical, enzymatic, and comparative sequence data shows good agreement between constraints dictated by the model and a wide variety of experimental observations. The four major structural domains created by the base-pairing scheme correspond closely to RNA fragments isolated after nuclease digestion in the presence of bound ribosomal proteins. Functionally important sites appear to be located in unpaired regions and are phylogenetically highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2129931102,"The α-amylase mRNAs which accumulate in two different tissues of the mouse, the salivary gland and the liver, are identical except for their 5′ nontranslated sequences: the 5′ terminal 158 nucleotides of the major liver α-amylase mRNA are unrelated to the 5′ terminal 47 nucleotides found in its salivary gland counterpart. DNA that specifies the 5′ terminal one-quarter of these mRNAs has been isolated through genomic cloning and sequenced. The initial 161 nucleotides of the liver α-amylase mRNA are specified by DNA sequences that lie 4.5 kb upstream from those for the common body of the two mRNAs. In contrast, the 5′ terminal 50 nucleotides of the salivary gland α-amylase mRNA are found 7.5 kb from sequences that the two mRNAs share in the genome. These cloned DNA sequences occur once per haploid genome, indicating that both the salivary gland and liver α-amylase mRNAs are transcribed from the same gene (AmylA). Since no rearrangement of these DNA sequences can be detected among mouse sperm, salivary gland or liver preparations, gross rearrangement does not account for the tissue-specific pattern of expression observed for AmylA. Rather, these data indicate that the salivary gland and liver α-amylase mRNAs are differentially transcribed and/or processed from identical DNA sequences in different tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1531504909,"Free cells isolated from adult rat heart by the collagenase method were maintained in culture up to 21 h with or without an islet-activating protein (IAP) that had been purified from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis. Short-term stimulation of beta-adrenergic or glucagon receptors in these cultured cells caused more accumulation of cAMP in cells precultured with IAP (IAP-treated) than in nontreated cells, although there was no significant difference in the baseline (non-stimulated) content of cAMP between these cells. Stimulation of muscarinic cholinergic or adenosine R-site receptors caused a marked inhibition of cAMP accumulation in nontreated cells in either the presence or absence of a beta-agonist (or glucagon); no such inhibition was essentially observed in IAP-treated cells. These actions of IAP developed gradually and were dose-dependent with the half-maximal concentration of approximately 80 ng/ml in culture. It is concluded that IAP may exert its unique influence on the heart cell membrane causing profound modification of the coupling mechanism involved in the receptor-mediated activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase. This action of IAP differs clearly from that of cholera toxin which activates adenylate cyclase rather independently of the receptor functions in heart cells."

https://openalex.org/W1541671026,"We have examined the effect of the myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-halide system and of activated human neutrophils on the ability of serum alpha 1-protease inhibitor (alpha 1-PI) to bind and inhibit porcine pancreatic elastase. Exposure to the isolated myeloperoxidase system resulted in nearly complete inactivation of alpha 1-PI. Inactivation was rapid (10 to 20 s); required active myeloperoxidase, micromolar concentrations of H2O2 (or glucose oxidase as a peroxide generator), and a halide cofactor (Cl- or I-); and was blocked by azide, cyanide, and catalase. Intact neutrophils similarly inactivated alpha 1-PI over the course of 5 to 10 min. Inactivation required the neutrophils, a halide (Cl-), and a phorbol ester to activate secretory and metabolic activity. It was inhibited by azide, cyanide, and catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. Neutrophils with absent myeloperoxidase or impaired oxidative metabolism (chronic granulomatous disease) failed to inactivate alpha 1-PI, and these defects were specifically corrected by the addition of myeloperoxidase or H2O2, respectively. Thus, stimulated neutrophils secrete myeloperoxidase and H2O2 which combine with a halide to inactivate alpha 1-PI. We suggest that leukocyte-derived oxidants, especially the myeloperoxidase system, may contribute to proteolytic tissue injury, for example in elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema, by oxidative inactivation of protective antiproteases."
https://openalex.org/W1516759786,"The murine alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin genes have been cloned from genomic libraries derived from Balb/c DNA. By restriction endonuclease mapping and electron microscopy, we have shown that both genes are organized similarly into 15 coding segments interrupted by 14 intervening sequences. The sizes of the corresponding coding segments in each gene are identical, lending support to the hypothesis that the two genes, were derived from a common ancestral gene. However, no nucleotide homology between coding segments was observed. Both the sizes and the nucleotide sequence of flanking and intervening sequences have diverged significantly as well. Two regions of the AFP gene, 925 base pairs in the 5' flanking DNA and 180 base pairs in the third intervening sequence, hybridized to the same region of DNA in the third intervening sequence of albumin. The 180-base pair homologies within each gene are present in opposite orientation relative to the direction of transcription, and are associated with reiterated DNA. Thus, it is unlikely that they represent true sequence conservation. An examination of the sizes of the coding segments in each gene reveals a thrice repeated domain, consisting of 4 coding segments. We propose that these correspond to the three domains observed in several mammalian albumins, and in murine AFP."
https://openalex.org/W2032578351,"The Tetrahymena thermophila ribosomal RNA gene contains an intervening sequence (IVS), which is transcribed as part of the precursor RNA and subsequently removed by splicing. We have found previously that the IVS is excised as a 0.4 kb RNA in isolated nuclei. We now report the finding of a novel RNA molecule, which is an electrophoretic variant (EV) of this 0.4 kb IVS RNA. The EV was identified as a form of the IVS RNA by Southern hybridization, RNA fingerprinting and R-loop mapping. A pulse-chase experiment established that in vitro the excised IVS RNA is converted to the EV by a post-splicing event. This conversion is enhanced at 39 degrees C compared to 30 degrees C and is irreversible under our experimental conditions. The EV of the IVS is a circular RNA. This structure was first suggested by its anomalous electrophoretic mobility on denaturing compared to nondenaturing gels. When the EV was prepared for electron microscopy under totally denaturing conditions, 0.4 kb circular molecules were observed. Furthermore, we have converted the circular form to a linear form by limited T1 RNAase digestion. The circular RNA survived treatment with DNAase, protease, glyoxal and various denaturants, which suggests that it is a covalently closed RNA circle."
https://openalex.org/W1964238319,"The axonal transport of two soluble enzymes of intermediary metabolism was evaluated: the nerve-specific form of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (NSE) and the brain isozyme of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Previously, little was known about the intracellular movements of the soluble proteins of the cell. Although the soluble enzymes of glycolysis and other pathways of intermediary metabolism have been thought to be freely diffusing in the cytosol, many are required in the axonal extremities of the neuron and must be transported to the sites of utilization. Comigration of purified enzymes with radioactive polypeptides associated with specific rate components of axonal transport in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicates that both NSE and CPK move in the axon solely as part of the group of proteins known as slow component b (SCb) at a rate of 2 mm/day. Peptide mapping following limited proteolysis confirmed identification of NSE and CPK in SCb. Materials associated with SCb have been shown to move coherently along the axon and to behave as a discrete cellular structure, the axoplasmic matrix. Association of two soluble enzymes, NSE and CPK, with the SCb complex of proteins requires a reevaluation of the assumption that these and other soluble proteins of the axon are freely diffusible."
https://openalex.org/W1526872296,"Calmodulin is a small, acidic, calcium-binding protein that exhibits multiple in vitro biochemical activities. Although calmodulin has no known enzymatic activity, it stimulates several enzyme activities in calcium-dependent manner. Because of its ubiquitous distribution and highly conserved structure, it has been difficult to elicit anti-calmodulin sera of useful titer. We describe here a reproducible and rapid method for producing anti-calmodulin sera. This method requires the injection of performic acid-oxidized calmodulin, but the antisera react equally well with unoxidized calmodulin. A response was elicited in 11 out of 11 rabbits using three variations of this method. Antisera titers were high enough to enable development of a quantitative radioimmunoassay using dilutions of whole sera, immunoglobulin fractions, or immunoglobulin fractions purified on calmodulin-Sepharose conjugates. For the majority of the antisera, the immunoreactive site is contained in a unique region of the calmodulin molecule. Based on the quantitative reactivity of overlapping tryptic and cyanogen bromide peptides, we propose that a major immunoreactive site is fund within an 18-residue region in the COOH-terminal domain of calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1494337704,"The amino acid sequence of mouse alpha-fetoprotein has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of its mRNA and three chimeric plasmids containing overlapping segments of its cDNA. A comparison of the amino acid sequence with that of either human and bovine albumin reveals in each case a 32% conservation of primary sequence. In addition, using the regularly spaced positions of cystine bridges, a 2-dimensional structure was generated, which revealed the presence of 3 closely related domains within alpha-fetoprotein. The structures of these domains are identical with the triplicated domains previously observed in several mammalian albumins. These homologies lend strong circumstantial evidence to the proposal that these two proteins arose in evolution as the consequence of a duplication in a common tripartite ancestral gene."
https://openalex.org/W2025206980,"Twenty micromolar hemin causes no change in the rate of division of K562 cells but results in accumulation of 11 to 14 picograms of embryonic and fetal hemoglobins per cell. This effect is reversible, and hemoglobin induction in response to hemin, and loss of hemoglobin upon removal of hemin, can be cyclically repeated. The cells can be indefinitely subcultured in the presence of the inducer. Thus, the control of hemoglobin levels in K562 cells does not depend on irreversible differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1535441861,"Pretreatment of L1210 cells with methotrexate in concentrations which produced free intracellular methotrexate and near maximal inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase resulted in an enhancement of intracellular 5-fluorouracil (FUra) accumulation. This enhancement of FUra accumulation was maximum (5-fold increase) after a 6-h exposure to 100 microM methotrexate. The nucleotide derivatives of FUra, including a 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate, and 5-fluorouridine-5'-triphosphate were also increased nearly 5-fold following methotrexate treatment. In cells pretreated with methotrexate, there was an increase in intracellular 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools which ranged from 2 to 8 times control values following concentrations of methotrexate between 0.1 microM and 10 microM. Both the increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and FUra accumulation could be prevented by the addition of Leucovorin (N5-formyltetrahydrofolate) at concentrations which rescued cells from the inhibitory effects of methotrexate. Pretreatment with 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside, which inhibits amidophosphoribosyltransferase, the first committed step in de novo purine synthesis, also resulted in a similar elevation in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools and enhancement of FUra accumulation. If the 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools were reduced following methotrexate pretreatment by the addition to the cultures of hypoxanthine, which utilizes 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate for the conversion to IMP, the intracellular accumulation of FUra was not enhanced. Also, if the inhibitor of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthetase, 7-deazaadenosine, was given to cultures with methotrexate, there was no increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools, nor enhancement of FUra accumulation. In addition, when 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine was added with the methotrexate to cell cultures, there was no increase in 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools, nor enhancement of intracellular FUra accumulation. These results indicate that the ability of methotrexate to enhance FUra accumulation was probably the consequence of the antipurine effect of methotrexate which resulted in a reduction of the complex feedback inhibition on 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate synthesis and utilization. The resultant increased 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate pools were then capable of being utilized for the conversion of FUra to 5-fluorouridylate, the possible rate-limiting step in FUra intracellular metabolism and the major determinant of the rate of intracellular FUra accumulation. When methotrexate preceded FUra, there was synergistic cell killing as determined by soft agar cloning. The exact mechanism of this sequential synergistic antitumor activity may be the result of the enhanced incorporation of FUra into RNA, since the increased 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate which is formed is unlikely to increase substantially the inhibition of dTMP synthesis induced by methotrexate pretreatment."

https://openalex.org/W1608191411,"The binding and internalization of 125I-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin (125I-alpha 2M) was studied in cultured fibroblasts. Two classes of binding sites were detected on cell surfaces. One class corresponds to the previously described, high affinity and low capacity sites. The other class of binding sites may mediate uptake of high physiological blood levels of 125I-alpha 2M and has not been described previously. At 0 degrees C, this lower affinity class saturates at approximately 1,000 micrograms/ml and has a capacity of approximately 600,000 sites/cell. The lower affinity class accounts for the vast majority of cellular receptors for alpha 2M. An assay employing pepsin at pH 4 was developed to distinguish between surface-bound and internalized 125I-alpha 2M. Cellular uptake of 125I-alpha 2M at 37 degrees C has a component which saturates between 200 and 1,000 micrograms/ml and the rate of internalization of this component was approximately 1,700,000 molecules/cell/h. One mM Ca2+ was required for cell uptake of 125I-alpha 2M at 37 degrees C. Ca2+ was also required for binding at 0 degrees C to both low and high affinity classes of binding sites for 125I-alpha 2M. The transglutaminase inhibitors bacitracin, monodansylcadaverine, and N-benzyloxycarboxyl-5-diazo-4-oxonorvaline paranitrophenyl ester all inhibited cellular internalization of 125I-alpha 2M at 37 degrees C. Each of these three compounds selectively reduced 125I-alpha 2M binding to the high affinity, low capacity component at 0 degrees C. Based on the current binding studies and previous studies using electron microscopy which showed that bacitracin and other transglutaminase inhibitors block clustering of alpha 2M-receptor complexes in coated pits, we suggest that the inhibitors block the accumulation of occupied lower affinity alpha 2M receptors in coated pits where they acquire a higher apparent affinity."

https://openalex.org/W1581829842,"The plasma membrane ATPases of eukaryotic cells of the vegetable type (fungi, plants, and algae) have been postulated to operate as proton pumps which generate membrane potentials and drive the uptake of nutrients by proton co-transport (Poole, R. J. (1978) Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 29, 437-460). In order to verify this important physiological role, a purified preparation of the yeast plasma membrane ATPase has been reconstituted with soybean phospholipids by a freeze-thaw-sonication procedure. The reconstituted proteoliposomes catalyzed a 32Pi-ATP exchange partially sensitive to proton ionophores (uncouplers) and to the proton-potassium exchange carrier nigericin. The reaction was completely inhibited by the nonspecific ionophore gramicidin and by the combination of uncouplers with the potassium ionophore valinomycin. These results are interpreted as evidence for two types of proton transport catalyzed by the enzyme preparation: electrogenic proton transport and electroneutral proton-potassium exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1996631481,"The structure and organization on the Escherichia coli chromosome of the gene cluster coding for two methionine tRNAs (tRNAmMet), four glutamine tRNAs (two tRNA1Gln and two tRNA2Gln), and a previously unidentified tRNA (called tRNAx) have been studied by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing, utilizing a specialized transducing bacteriophage (lambda psu degrees 2) carrying the supB-supE region. From the sequence analysis, the previously unidentified tRNA has been shown to have an anticodon sequence (5'-UAG-3') corresponding to a leucine codon. The organization of this tRNA gene cluster on the E. coli chromosome is tRNAmMet-9 base pairs-tRNAx-23 base pairs-tRNA1Gln-34 base pairs-tRNA1Gln-15 base pairs-tRNAmMet-47 base pairs-tRNA2Gln-37 base pairs-tRNA2Gln. The duplicated genes coding for tRNAmMet, tRNA,Gln, and tRNA2Gln have identical sequences, which are the same as the sequences determined previously with tRNA molecules. These tRNA sequences are preceded by a single promoter region where a ""Pribnow box"" sequence is present seven base pairs upstream from the transcription start site. The spacer regions separating the seven tRNA sequences are different from each other both in size and in nucleotide sequence. The possible implication of these sequences for precursor processing is discussed. A restriction fragment that has been originally identified in lambda psu degrees 2 DNA and shown to contain the seven tRNA genes has been detected in the E. coli chromosome, thereby suggesting that this tRNA gene cluster is present in the bacterial genome with the same organization as in the transducing phage genome."

https://openalex.org/W1599786218,"Relative synthesis of malic enzyme is stimulated 25-to 100-fold by feeding neonatal ducklings or by incubating embryonic chick hepatocytes in culture with triiodothyronine. Synthesis of the enzyme is almost completely blocked when fed birds are starved or when triiodothyronine-treated hepatocytes in culture are also treated with glucagon. Cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from livers of intact ducklings or hepatocytes in culture treated as described above and translated in an mRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The identity of malic enzyme synthesized in the cell-free system was confirmed by virtue of its antigenicity, subunit molecular weight, and proteolytic peptide pattern. Translatable levels of malic enzyme mRNA paralleled changes in relative synthesis of malic enzyme in vivo and in hepatocytes in culture. Translatable levels od albumin mRNA were either unaffected or changed in a direction opposite to that of malic enzyme mRNA. Thus, both nutritional and hormonal regulation of malic enzyme synthesis involves regulation of cytoplasmic translatable malic enzyme mRNA levels. The hepatocyte culture system is ideally suited for future studies on the regulation of malic enzyme mRNA synthesis and/or degradation by thyroid hormone and glucagon."

https://openalex.org/W2415527260,"Antisera have been prepared against two lysosomal enzymes of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum. The two purified enzyme preparations used for immunization, N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase-1, show no cross-contamination with each other and no significant contamination by other lysosomal enzymes. However, antisera raised against either enzyme bind equally well to seven different lysosomal enzymes and show no preference for the enzyme against which they were raised. A total of 10 different antisera have been examined and all show similar results. Preadsorption of antisera with either purified enzyme removes all antibody activity against the other enzyme. Evidence is presented which indicates that the same species of antibodies are responsible for the precipitation of seven lysosomal enzymes. These data are discussed in terms of the proposal that the antigen that is shared by the lysosomal enzymes is a post-translational modification of the enzyme proteins. We have sought to further characterize the distribution of this common antigen among cellular proteins. We show that N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase-1 represent less than 5% of the total common antigen containing proteins in the cell. Precipitation of 35S-labeled cellular proteins from vegetative cells indicates that as much as 15-30% of the total cell protein may possess the common antigen. Preadsorption experiments confirm that all of the proteins immunoprecipitated in these experiments are recognized by the same antibodies that precipitate the lysosomal enzyme activities. Most of the labeled proteins are secreted into the medium along with the lysosomal enzyme activities during axenic growth. During the developmental phase of the life cycle of Dictyostelium, the total amount of the common antigen decreases about 2-fold relative to total cell protein. However, the synthesis of antigenic proteins continues throughout most of development."

This relationship was observed as a function of hormone dose, incubation time, and changes in receptor affinity. However, the rate of cAMP production diminished with time in intact cells exposed to high hormone concentrations, even in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. A rapid desensitization of adenylate cyclase activity was observed in minutes upon treatment of intact cells with high hormonal concentrations. Desensitization was dose- and time-dependent. Hypertonic sodium chloride, which increased hormonal binding and cell cAMP production, prevented desensitization. The acute decrease in hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity correlated with increased occupancy of low affinity binding sites. EDTA-suspended cells, which have a homogeneous population of binding sites, did not demonstrate desensitization. A proposal is made as to the consequences of this phenomenon at physiological concentrations of vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W1511455083,"To determine whether 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent increases in intestinal calcium uptake require de novo protein and RNA synthesis, the effects of several inhibitors of these processes have been re-examined in vitro using cultured embryonic chick duodenum. To minimize the contributions of antibiotic toxicity to the interpretation of results, care was taken to examine inhibitor effects at early times after the onset of the 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 response. Cycloheximide at a concentration of 5 microM blocked hormone-dependent calcium uptake at all times examined (6 to 24 h). Actinomycin D was similarly effective at 6 to 12 h. The effects of cycloheximide were totally reversible while actinomycin D inhibition was only partially reversible. These compounds inhibited protein or RNA synthesis by 68.4 +/- 1.4 and 51.4 +/- 1.1%, respectively. Anisomycin, another inhibitor of polypeptide chain elongation and alpha-amanitin, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase I, also blocked 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent calcium uptake after 12 h in culture. These results further strengthen the hypothesis that 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulates intestinal calcium transport via a nuclear mechanism involving new gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2061638062,A clone of L1210 mouse leukemia cells selected for resistance to both the antiviral and anticellular properties of mouse interferon were essentially devoid of fatty acid cyclooxygenase activity. Experiments in which broken cell preparations were mixed or the two cell types were cultivated together failed to indicate the presence of a diffusible enzyme inhibitor. Fatty acid lipoxygenase activity of similar magnitude was detectable in both cell types. A selective impairment of fatty acid cyclooxygenase in interferon-resistant cells is consistent with recently described data suggesting that this enzyme may play a crucial role in mediating the antiviral and anticellular effects of interferon.
https://openalex.org/W1512903662,"Severe curtailment of RNA synthesis and widespread readjustment of cellular activities, together with an increase of guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate (ppGpp) have been demonstrated in Escherichia coli cells starved for amino acid or energy. The rates of growth and RNA synthesis are reduced by shifting the growth temperature from 40 degrees C to 20 degrees C. The intracellular pool of ppGpp diminishes under such conditions. Furthermore, the accumulation of ppGpp normally attainable by either amino acid- or energy-limitation can be totally blocked by a downshift of temperature imposed prior to the starvation. However, the synthesis of stable RNA is still stringently restricted under these conditions. Two other nucleotides were also effected. The intracellular level of phantom spot (Gallant, J., Shell, L., and Bittner, R. (1976) Cell 7, 75-84) decreased upon temperature fall. Guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3'-monophosphate, whose concentrations have been linked to stringent response and stable RNA synthesis, did not change by the simple temperature downshift, but increased following amino acid limitation even when a downshift of temperature was imposed before the starvation. These results suggest that ppGpp is not always needed for inhibition of stable RNA synthesis during stringent response, and that a compound such as guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3-monophosphate may be involved in the stringent regulation of stable RNA synthesis, at least under the temperature downshift conditions."

https://openalex.org/W1501296437,"Abstract A recombinant DNA library of sheep genomic DNA fragments inserted into the bacteriophage vector, Charon 4A, was screened by plaque hybridization with a probe for sheep gamma-globin gene sequences. Three clones containing overlapping segments of DNA, the total length of which was 25 kb, were identified; each included all or a part of the same globin gene. Nucleotide sequencing of substantial portions of the globin gene in one clone, lambda S gamma G31, and of the gene in a previously isolated recombinant, lambda S beta AG21, established that the genes in these recombinants encoded for the gamma- and beta A-globin genes of sheep, respectively. Features characteristic of globin genes in other species that were identified in both genes included a sequence, ATAAAA, 30 nucleotides from the presumed site of initiation of transcription, a region of capping homology, two introns at positions corresponding to amino acids 29-30 and 103-104 and the polyadenylation sequence, AATAAA, in the 3' untranslated region. Electron microscopic analysis of heteroduplexes formed between lambda S gamma G31 and lambda S beta AG21 revealed that the gamma and beta A genes of sheep lie within segments of homologous DNA at least 8 kb in length within which were identified small regions of nonhomology both 5' and 3' to the genes."
https://openalex.org/W1538913919,"In an earlier report, it was shown that aflatoxin B1 treatment strongly inhibits rat liver nucleolar RNA synthesis (Yu, F. L. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 3245-3251). The present paper is an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition. Two h after aflatoxin B1 injection (0.3 mg/100 g body weight), rat liver nucleolar RNA synthesis, in vitro, was inhibited by an average of 90%. This inhibition could result from (a) inhibited RNA polymerase I activity per se, (b) impaired nucleolar DNA template, or (c) impaired nucleolar chromatin. Earlier studies found that the total RNA polymerase I activity was not affected by aflatoxin B1 treatment. In the present work the total nucleolar DNAs from control and from aflatoxin B1-treated groups were isolated and compared for template efficiencies in directing RNA synthesis with solubilized RNA polymerase I from the control group. No difference was found. However, when nucleolar chromatin function was analyzed, it was found that aflatoxin B1 treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in the RNA chain elongation rate to only 13% of the control. The chain number, which is a measure of the number of engaged enzymes transcribing the nucleolar chromatin initiated in vivo, was only slightly reduced (33%). Furthermore since it was found that aflatoxin B1 treatment did not increase RNase activity in the treated nucleoli, the dramatic decrease in RNA chain elongation is therefore believed to be the major mechanism of aflatoxin B1 inhibition of rat liver nucleolar RNA synthesis. DNase I digestion of the nucleolar chromatin suggests that aflatoxin B1 treatment may have altered the conformation of the transcriptionally active regions of the nucleolar chromatin."

The results obtained favor the conclusion that the dimagnesium salt of P-Rib-PP is the true substrate of the enzyme. The other species of P-Rib-PP do not appreciably affect the initial reaction rate. The inhibition of the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase-catalyzed reaction observed at high MgCl2 concentration can be attributed to a competitive inhibition of Mg2+ with respect to the dimagnesium salt of P-Rib-PP, suggesting that these ionic species bind to the same enzyme form. At a fixed [P-Rib-PPtot], the concentration of its dimagnesium complex is a sigmoidal function of MgCl2 concentration, suggesting that caution must be employed in the interpretation of sigmoidal saturation curves for P-Rib-PP-utilizing enzymes when low and not constant concentrations of the divalent cation are used."

https://openalex.org/W1991282717,"During the course of immunization of hybrid mice (genotype H-2b/k) with a parental Abelson virus-induced lymphoma (genotype H-2b/b), antibodies were produced to the H-2Kb or H-2Db antigens of the immunizing cells. Such 'anti-self H-2' antibodies demonstrate the existence of autoreactive B-cell clones in hybrid mice, and pose intriguing questions for the nature of self-tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1605033909,"A protein similar to rat intestinal calcium-binding protein (CaBP) has been identified in both mouse placenta and mouse small intestine. The mouse protein had a molecular weight of approximately 10,000, exhibited cation-binding properties, and demonstrated immunologic identity with vitamin D-dependent rat CaBP. Under normal dietary conditions, the concentrations of CaBP in mouse placenta and intestine increased 6- and 3-fold, respectively, during the third trimester of pregnancy in parallel with the fetal demands for skeletal mineral. Studies of in vitro protein synthesis indicated that CaBP was synthesized by placental tissue. Slices of mouse or rat placental tissue (12-18-day gestation) were incubated with [3H]leucine and the biosynthesis of placental CaBP was quantified by an immunoprecipitation method using rabbit antiserum to rat intestinal CaBP. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the radioactive immune complex revealed a single 3H-labeled peak corresponding to the molecular weight of rat and mouse CaBP (10,050). The amount of CaBP synthesized by mouse placental tissue was dependent upon gestational age of the placenta and reflected the in vivo changes in placental CaBP content observed during gestation. These data indicate that CaBP is synthesized by placenta and provide an in vitro model for studying the developmental control of placental CaBP synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W12779598,"Rabbit antiserum against rat liver-soluble cytochrome b9 was produced. The antiserum was specific to cytochrome b9 and did not react with hemoglobin, cytochrome c, cytochrome H-450, serum, hemolysate, and tissue extracts from lung, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle. From Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion and tandem crossed immunoelectrophoresis, the antigen was found in liver, kidney, and heart tissue extracts of rat with complete identity. From crossed immunoelectrophoresis, the antiserum distinguished monomeric and dimeric forms of the antigen. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis for quantitating the antigen was developed with a minimum sensitivity of 5 ng. By using rocket immunoelectrophoresis, the concentration of the antigen in crude tissue extracts from liver, heart, and kidney was determined. The antigen was not detectable in crude extracts from lung, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle by immunological methods. Therefore, the immunological assay method was very useful for identifying and quantitating cytochrome b9 in crude extracts with high sensitivity."
