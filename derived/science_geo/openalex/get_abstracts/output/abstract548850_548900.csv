https://openalex.org/W2220230765,"Despite decades of research establishing the causes and consequences of emotions in the laboratory, we know surprisingly little about emotions in everyday life. We developed a smartphone application that monitored real-time emotions of an exceptionally large (N = 11,000+) and heterogeneous participants sample. People’s everyday life seems profoundly emotional: participants experienced at least one emotion 90% of the time. The most frequent emotion was joy, followed by love and anxiety. People experienced positive emotions 2.5 times more often than negative emotions, but also experienced positive and negative emotions simultaneously relatively frequently. We also characterized the interconnections between people’s emotions using network analysis. This novel approach to emotion research suggests that specific emotions can fall into the following categories 1) connector emotions (e.g., joy), which stimulate same valence emotions while inhibiting opposite valence emotions, 2) provincial emotions (e.g., gratitude), which stimulate same valence emotions only, or 3) distal emotions (e.g., embarrassment), which have little interaction with other emotions and are typically experienced in isolation. Providing both basic foundations and novel tools to the study of emotions in everyday life, these findings demonstrate that emotions are ubiquitous to life and can exist together and distinctly, which has important implications for both emotional interventions and theory."
https://openalex.org/W2209423656,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the potential precursors of metastatic disease. Most assays established for the enumeration of CTCs so far-including the gold standard CellSearch-rely on the expression of the cell surface marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). But, these approaches may not detect CTCs that express no/low levels of EpCAM, e.g. by undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here we present an enrichment strategy combining different antibodies specific for surface proteins and extracellular matrix (ECM) components to capture an EpCAMlow/neg cell line and EpCAMneg CTCs from blood samples of breast cancer patients depleted for EpCAM-positive cells. The expression of respective proteins (Trop2, CD49f, c-Met, CK8, CD44, ADAM8, CD146, TEM8, CD47) was verified by immunofluorescence on EpCAMpos (e.g. MCF7, SKBR3) and EpCAMlow/neg (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cell lines. To test antibodies and ECM proteins (e.g. hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen I, laminin) for capturing EpCAMneg cells, the capture molecules were first spotted in a single- and multi-array format onto aldehyde-coated glass slides. Tumor cell adhesion of EpCAMpos/neg cell lines was then determined and visualized by Coomassie/MitoTracker staining. In consequence, marginal binding of EpCAMlow/neg MDA-MB-231 cells to EpCAM-antibodies could be observed. However, efficient adhesion/capturing of EpCAMlow/neg cells could be achieved via HA and immobilized antibodies against CD49f and Trop2. Optimal capture conditions were then applied to immunomagnetic beads to detect EpCAMneg CTCs from clinical samples. Captured CTCs were verified/quantified by immunofluorescence staining for anti-pan-Cytokeratin (CK)-FITC/anti-CD45 AF647/DAPI. In total, in 20 out of 29 EpCAM-depleted fractions (69%) from 25 metastatic breast cancer patients additional EpCAMneg CTCs could be identified [range of 1-24 CTCs per sample] applying Trop2, CD49f, c-Met, CK8 and/or HA magnetic enrichment. EpCAMneg dual-positive (CKpos/CD45pos) cells could be traced in 28 out of 29 samples [range 1-480]. By single-cell array-based comparative genomic hybridization we were able to demonstrate the malignant nature of one EpCAMneg subpopulation. In conclusion, we established a novel enhanced CTC enrichment strategy to capture EpCAMneg CTCs from clinical blood samples by targeting various cell surface antigens with antibody mixtures and ECM components."

Pyroglutamate formation increases the rate of Aβ oligomerization and alters the interactions of Aβ with Cu2+ and lipids; however, a link between these properties and the toxicity of pE-Aβ peptides has not been established. We report here that Aβ3pE-42 has an enhanced capacity to cause lipid peroxidation in primary cortical mouse neurons compared with the full-length isoform (Aβ(1–42)). In contrast, Aβ(1–42) caused a significant elevation in cytosolic reactive oxygen species, whereas Aβ3pE-42 did not. We also report that Aβ3pE-42 preferentially associates with neuronal membranes and triggers Ca2+ influx that can be partially blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. Aβ3pE-42 further caused a loss of plasma membrane integrity and remained bound to neurons at significantly higher levels than Aβ(1–42) over extended incubations.

As a consequence, amino-truncation can expose glutamate residues (positions 3 and 11 of Aβ) to cyclization by the action of glutaminyl cyclase (QC), forming the highly amyloidogenic pyroglutamate-Aβ (pE-Aβ) peptides Aβ3pE-40, Aβ3pE-42, Aβ11pE-40, and Aβ11pE-42 (7Schilling S.

We therefore aimed to determine whether full-length Aβ and pE-Aβ possess differences in their capacity to alter ROS flux and cause oxidative damage to neurons in vitro. Additionally, Aβ isoforms were compared for their capacity to form oligomers and covalent tyrosine-tyrosine bonds (dityrosine) as a result of Aβ-copper-redox cycling. The capacity for Aβ to form dityrosine has previously been correlated with neurotoxicity (38Smith D.P. Smith D.G. Curtain C.C. Boas J.F. Pilbrow J.R. Ciccotosto G.D. Lau T.L. Tew D.J. Perez K.

Further comparisons were made between the peptides for their capacity to perturb neuronal membranes and induce changes in neuronal ion homeostasis (Ca2+ flux). Aβ peptides were purchased from the ERI Amyloid Laboratory, LLC, and purified by reversed-phase HPLC to >95% purity. All chemicals used were analytical grade and purchased from ChemSupply (Australia) unless otherwise stated. Thioflavin-T, coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (3-CCA), butylated hydroxytoluene, bovine serum albumin, and paraformaldehyde were purchased from Sigma. Diamsar (1,8-diaminosarcophagine) was synthesized as reported previously (40Bottomley G. Clark I. Creaser I. Englehardt L. Geue R. Hagen K. Harrowfield J. Lawrance G. Lay P. Sargeson A. See A.

Aβ stock solutions were prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptides to 5 mg/ml in NaOH (60 mm) and incubating at ambient temperature for 5 min to dissociate aggregated material. Solutions were then diluted to 1 mg/ml in MilliQ H2O and 10× PBS (PBS is defined as 50 mm sodium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl) at a v/v/v ratio of 2:7:1 (NaOH, H2O, 10× PBS). The preparation was sonicated for 10 min in an iced water bath and then centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (upper 80% of solution) were removed to pre-chilled tubes on ice; pH was adjusted by addition of NaH2PO4 (0.5 m) to 1.0% v/v and then kept on ice for immediate use. Aβ stock concentrations were determined by UV spectrometry by measuring absorbance at 214 nm (A214) and applying the following extinction coefficients (m−1 cm−1) determined from UV scans and amino acid analysis: Aβ(1–40) = 91,462; Aβ3pE-40 = 89,705; Aβ(1–42) = 94,526; and Aβ3pE-42 = 90,925. Aβ oligomers were generated by reacting Aβ (10 μm) with Cu2+ (10 μm, as CuCl2·glycine6) and ascorbate (100 μm) at 37 °C on a vertically rotating wheel at 20 rpm, in 2-ml round-bottom tubes (catalog no. 0030123.344, Eppendorf). Reactions were halted with the addition of EDTA (to 250 μm) and placed on ice. Control incubations of Aβ only were incubated and sampled under identical conditions for comparison. Aβ fibrillization assays (thioflavin-T assays) were performed as described previously (41McColl G. Roberts B.R. Gunn A.P. Perez K.A. Tew D.J. Masters C.L. Barnham K.J. Cherny R.A. Bush A.I.

Hydroxyl radical production in Aβ-copper-redox cycling reactions was assessed with the fluorescent probe coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (3-CCA) using methodology adapted from Manevich et al.

Reactions containing Aβ peptides (20 μm) and 3-CCA (100 μm) in the presence or absence of Cu2+ (20 μm, as CuCl2·glycine6) and ascorbate (300 μm) in PBS, pH 7.4, were incubated in black-walled clear bottom microplates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C in a heated Flexstation III spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence signals were read from the bottom of the microplate every 30 s using excitation λ 395 nm and measuring emission at λ 450 nm. Rate constants for the 3-CCA reactions were determined from one-phase association regressions of logY transformed data (data manipulations performed in GraphPad Prism version 6.0). The dityrosine content of Cu2+-reacted Aβ samples was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometry (λ 320 nm excitation and λ 420 nm emission), as described previously (43Gunn A.P. Roberts B.R. Bush A.I. Rapid generation of dityrosine cross-linked Aβ oligomers via Cu-redox cycling.Methods Mol. Biol. 2012; 849: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Reaction half-times and rate constants (K = min−1) were calculated from one-phase association regressions of fluorescence data (GraphPad Prism version 6.0). Calculation of Aβ hydrophobic scores were determined from the sum of the amino acid residue hydropathic indexes (44Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein.J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17170) Google Scholar). Pyroglutamyl residues were assigned a hydropathy value of −1.0. Tissue extracts and synthetic peptides were separated by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% XT BisTris gels (Criterion, Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were transferred to pre-assembled PVDF membrane stacks using a Trans-Blot® semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, pH 8.0) containing 5% w/v skim milk. Primary antibodies were incubated on blots for at least 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako) were diluted 1:10,000 in TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% w/v sodium azide. Blots were washed four times for 10 min in TBS-T after each primary and secondary antibody binding step. Chemiluminescence signals were captured after application of ECL (Immobilon, Millipore) with an LAS3000 detector and analyzed using MultiGauge software (Fujifilm). Aβ peptides were detected using the monoclonal mouse antibodies 4G8 (Covance) or 6E10 (Signet Laboratories) diluted to 1 μg/ml. The dityrosine modification was detected using the 1C3 antibody raised against synthetic dityrosine (catalog no. NWA-DIY020, Northwest Life Science Specialties), at a 1:1000 dilution. Aβ oligomers in HBSS buffer were prepared as above but at twice the concentration (20 μm Aβ, 20 μm Cu2+, 200 μm ascorbate) to provide adequate signals for measurement. SEC analysis was performed using a BioLogic DuoFlow QuadTec 40 system (Bio-Rad) fitted with a Superdex 75 10/300 column (catalog no. 17-5174-01, GE Healthcare). Both equilibration and operation of the column were in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 μm filtered and de-gassed) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and ambient temperature. The absorbance at 214, 260, and 280 nm was monitored, collecting 5 data points/s. Samples were injected onto the column (0.5 ml per run, ∼45 μg of Aβ) immediately after collection at indicated time points. AFM analyses were performed on Aβ reactions prepared in Neurobasal medium (catalog no. 21103-049, Gibco) at 10 μm. Samples (10 μl) were collected and spotted on freshly cleaved mica, dried at room temperature for 5 min in a laminar flow hood, and rinsed with 2 ml of de-ionized water (Milli-Q, Millipore). The sample was blown dry with nitrogen (Coregas Nitrogen 4.0) before being transferred to the AFM sample stage (Asylum Research Cypher AFM). Images were acquired in alternating current (tapping) mode in air using Tap300-G silicon AFM probes (Budget Sensors) with scan rates of 1.5–2.5 Hz; drive amplitude was kept to a minimum with amplitude set-points of 60–80%. The mask threshold was set to 250 pm for image analysis. All experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. Mouse cortical neuronal cultures isolated from C57Bl/6 E14 embryos were prepared as described previously (45Barnham K.J. Ciccotosto G.D. Tickler A.K. Ali F.E. Smith D.G. Williamson N.A. Lam Y.H.

All cell culture materials were purchased from Gibco/Thermo Fisher unless otherwise stated. Cells were grown in Neurobasal medium (NB) containing B27 supplements, gentamicin, and 0.5 mm GlutaMAXTM. Fresh NB medium containing B27 minus antioxidants (B27-AO) and cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (2 μm; catalog no. C1768, Sigma) were applied after 6 days in vitro (DIV). Neurons were further incubated until DIV 8 or 9 prior to applying treatments. Levels of cell-bound Aβ were measured following exposure to Aβ peptides applied in NB medium containing B27-AO and cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside. Cells (DIV 8 or 9) were treated for 48 h with Aβ mixtures (10 μm total). The media were removed, and cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's PBS (catalog no. 14190-144, Gibco), and then the cells were extracted with M-PER reagent (catalog no. 78501, Thermo-Scientific). For fractionation studies, cells were scraped into TBS, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors (cOmplete, catalog no. 11873580001, Roche Applied Science) and probe-sonicated by two rounds of 10 bursts (40% power, 0.5 s each) with a Sonifier S-250D (Branson). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and supernatants (TBS phase) were collected to fresh tubes. The pellets were extracted with an equal volume of Na2CO3 (100 mm, pH 12) for 1 h of incubation on ice and then briefly vortexed and centrifuged again to collect supernatants (carbonate phase). Pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of urea buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 1% DTT, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Western blots were performed on 5 μg of total protein based on BCA assays (catalog no. 23225, Thermo-Scientific) of TBS phases, loading equal volumes for carbonate and urea phases. M17 neuroblastomas were cultured in DMEM containing fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10% v/v) and penicillin/streptomycin (catalog no. 15140, Gibco). Cells were plated in 6-well culture plates (catalog no. 140675, Nunc) at 40,000 cells/cm2 and incubated overnight (37 °C, 5% CO2). Fresh medium supplemented with retinoic acid (10 μm) was applied, and the cells were allowed to differentiate for 48 h. Freshly prepared Aβ solutions (10 μm) or synthetic lipid peroxide (1 μm) were applied to cells for 4 h and then the cells were collected using trypsin and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% FBS. Propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a Beckman Coulter CyAn ADP analyzer with Summit 4.0.3 acquisition software. Debris and cell aggregates were excluded by gating. Live and dead cells were then identified based on exclusion and inclusion, respectively, of propidium iodide. Analysis of data were performed using FCS Express 4 analysis software. Neuronal ROS flux was measured using the redox-sensitive probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (catalog no. D399, Molecular Probes), essentially as described previously (46Wang H. Joseph J.A. Quantifying cellular oxidative stress by dichlorofluorescein assay using microplate reader.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (100 μm) was applied to cells (DIV 9) in NB medium supplemented with B27-AO (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 60 min; the media were then removed, and the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS; catalog no. 14175-079, Gibco).

These facilities are managed by professional nurses or clinical officers who are recognised to play a key role in implementing health sector reforms and facilitating initiatives aimed at strengthening community involvement. Little in-depth research exists about the dimensions and challenges of these managers’ jobs, or on the impact of decentralisation on their roles and responsibilities. In this paper, we describe the roles and responsibilities of PHC managers–or ‘in-charges’ in Kenya, and their challenges and coping strategies, under accelerated devolution. Methods The data presented in this paper is part of a wider set of activities aimed at understanding governance changes under devolution in Kenya, under the umbrella of a ‘learning site’. A learning site is a long term process of collaboration between health managers and researchers deciding together on key health system questions and interventions. Data were collected through seven formal in depth interviews and observations at four PHC facilities as well as eight in depth interviews and informal interactions with sub-county managers from June 2013 to July 2014. Drawing on the Aragon framework of organisation capacity we discuss the multiple accountabilities, daily routines, challenges and coping strategies among PHC facility managers. Results PHC in-charges perform complex and diverse roles in a difficult environment with relatively little formal preparation. Their key concerns are lack of job clarity and preparedness, the difficulty of balancing multidirectional accountability responsibilities amidst significant resource shortages, and remuneration anxieties. We show that day-to-day management in an environment of resource constraints and uncertainty requires PHC in-charges who are resilient, reflective, and continuously able to learn and adapt. We highlight the importance of leadership development including the building of critical soft skills such as relationship building."

However, in vitro treatments with saturated fatty acids or their derivative ceramide demonstrate an effect only at the Akt step. In this study, we adapted our experimental procedures to mimic the in vivo situation and show that the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is involved in the long-term effects of saturated fatty acids on IRS1. C2C12 or human muscle cells were incubated with palmitate or directly with ceramide for short or long periods, and insulin signaling pathway activity was evaluated. PKR involvement was assessed through pharmacological and genetic studies. Short-term treatments of myotubes with palmitate, a ceramide precursor, or directly with ceramide induce an inhibition of Akt, whereas prolonged periods of treatment show an additive inhibition of insulin signaling through increased IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation. PKR mRNA, protein, and phosphorylation are increased in insulin-resistant muscles. When PKR activity is reduced (siRNA or a pharmacological inhibitor), serine phosphorylation of IRS1 is reduced, and insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt is improved. Finally, we show that JNK mediates ceramide-activated PKR inhibitory action on IRS1. Together, in the long term, our results show that ceramide acts at two distinct levels of the insulin signaling pathway (IRS1 and Akt).

In healthy subjects, the balance between glucose production and utilization is controlled carefully. When circulating glucose reaches a critical threshold, pancreatic β cells secrete insulin, which increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscles and inhibits hepatic glucose production. Under conditions of lipid oversupply from the diet, the capacity of adipose tissue to store fatty acids is overwhelmed, and fatty acids accumulate in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscles or liver. Strong evidence indicates that lipid accumulation in peripheral tissues is linked to the development of insulin resistance observed during obesity or type 2 diabetes. In rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD), 3The abbreviations used are: HFD, high-fat diet; PKR, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. insulin resistance is observed in skeletal muscle because of alteration of the insulin signaling pathway both at the IRS1 and Akt steps (1Silveira L.R.

Among lipids, ceramide is involved in the onset of muscle insulin resistance (4Hage Hassan R. Bourron O. Hajduch E. Defect of insulin signal in peripheral tissues: important role of ceramide.World J. Diabetes. 2014; 5: 244-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide is distributed widely in cell membranes where, beyond a structural function, it has a key role in intracellular signaling, regulation of growth, proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and differentiation (5Hannun Y.A.

Bioactive sphingolipids: metabolism and function.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S91-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Under conditions of fatty acid overload, ceramide is mainly synthetized by de novo synthesis from saturated fatty acids such as palmitate (4Hage Hassan R. Bourron O. Hajduch E. Defect of insulin signal in peripheral tissues: important role of ceramide.World J. Diabetes. 2014; 5: 244-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The key role of ceramide in diet-induced insulin resistance has been demonstrated in studies using genetic or pharmacological inhibition. For example, inhibition of serine palmitoyl transferase, the first enzyme that regulates de novo synthesis of ceramide from palmitate (7Bellini L. Campana M. Mahfouz R. Carlier A. Véret J. Magnan C.

The mechanisms by which ceramide inhibits insulin signaling have been elucidated in vitro, but they only partially recapitulate what is observed in vivo in muscles of HFD-fed animals. We and others have shown in muscle cell lines that ceramide does not target the insulin signaling pathway through an inhibition of IRS1 activity but, rather, by specifically inhibiting Akt by two alternative mechanisms involving atypical protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) (11Litherland G.J.

We have demonstrated recently that the ceramide-activated PKCζ pathway prevails in human myotubes (17Mahfouz R. Khoury R. Blachnio-Zabielska A. Turban S. Loiseau N. Lipina C. Stretton C. Bourron O.

Although the mechanisms by which ceramide inhibits Akt are now well documented, those involved in the inhibition of IRS1 remain unknown. The double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) could play a role in this process. PKR is an interferon-induced protein that is part of the innate immune response and inhibits viral replication. During viral infection, PKR is activated by double-stranded RNAs produced by viruses. The PKR main target is the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eiF2α), phosphorylation of which leads to translation inhibition and enables the cell to block viral protein translation (18Baird T.D. Wek R.C. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation and translational control in metabolism.Adv. Nutr. 2012; 3: 307-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). PKR also plays an important role in modulating insulin signaling (19Yang X. Nath A. Opperman M.J. Chan C. PKR differentially regulates IRS1 and IRS2 in HepG2 cells.Mol. Biol.

Chronic administration of PKR inhibitors to obese and diabetic mice improves both their insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (21Nakamura T. Arduini A. Baccaro B. Furuhashi M. Hotamisligil G.S. Small molecule inhibitors of PKR improve glucose homeostasis in obese, diabetic mice.Diabetes. 2014; 63: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, PKR interferes directly with insulin signaling by phosphorylating IRS1 on serine residues or indirectly by activating stress proteins such as JNK (22Nakamura T. Furuhashi M. Li P. Cao H. Tuncman G. Sonenberg N. Gorgun C.Z. Hotamisligil G.S. Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase links pathogen sensing with stress and metabolic homeostasis.Cell. 2010; 140: 338-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Because both palmitate and ceramide are PKR activators (19Yang X. Nath A. Opperman M.J. Chan C. PKR differentially regulates IRS1 and IRS2 in HepG2 cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that PKR could be the missing link between ceramide and its deleterious effects on insulin signaling at the IRS1 level in muscle cells. In this study, we provide evidence that palmitate and ceramide inhibit insulin signaling acutely at the Akt level and chronically at the IRS1 level through a PKR/JNK pathway.

C2C12 myotubes were washed rapidly with HEPES-buffered saline, and glucose uptake was assayed as described previously (29Blair A.S. Hajduch E. Litherland G.J. Hundal H.S.

In skeletal muscle of mice fed an HFD, we observed a 3-fold increase in IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of this specific residue has been associated extensively with a loss of the insulin signal (30Jiang G. Dallas-Yang Q. Liu F. Moller D.E. Zhang B.B.

Concomitantly, a 40% decrease in Akt threonine 308 phosphorylation was also observed in muscle lysates of HFD-treated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 1A), confirming impaired activation of the insulin signaling pathway in muscles of HFD-treated mice. Until now, these results obtained in vivo could not be reproduced in vitro. Indeed, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with an excess of palmitate for up to 16 h prevented insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation without any serine phosphorylation of IRS1 (Fig. 1B). We tried to mimic the in vivo situation by treating C2C12 myotubes for longer periods (48 h) with lower concentrations of palmitate (0.25 mmol/liter) to avoid cell death (33Peterson J.M. Wang Y. Bryner R.W. Williamson D.L. Alway S.E. Bax signaling regulates palmitate-mediated apoptosis in C(2)C(12) myotubes.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2008; 295: E1307-E1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that ceramide concentrations increased 3-fold in cells incubated with palmitate for 16 and 48 h. Figs. 1B shows that, as observed in vivo, 48-h palmitate treatment induced an increase in IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation. Concomitantly, we observed a decrease in IRS1 tyrosine 612 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). In parallel, phosphorylation of Akt was impaired in response to insulin (Fig. 1D). We have shown previously that ceramide is responsible for the acute deleterious effect of palmitate on insulin signaling in muscle (4Hage Hassan R. Bourron O. Hajduch E. Defect of insulin signal in peripheral tissues: important role of ceramide.World J. Diabetes. 2014; 5: 244-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Powell D.J. Turban S. Gray A. Hajduch E. Hundal H.S.

J. 2004; 382: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We therefore inhibited sphingolipid synthesis with myriocin, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase. Fig. 1E shows that exposure of C2C12 myotubes to palmitate for 48 h induced an increase of sphinganine (ceramide precursor), total ceramide, and sphingosine-1-phosphate (a ceramide derivative). As expected, sphingolipid metabolism was inhibited after pretreatment of cells with myriocin (Fig. 1E). As shown in Fig. 1D, the deleterious effect of 48-h palmitate treatment was totally abolished for IRS1 and Akt after pretreatment of cells with myriocin, demonstrating that chronic palmitate action on insulin signaling occurred through ceramide. We reproduced the long-term action of palmitate by treating C2C12 myotubes directly with a cell-permeable, short-chain C2-ceramide analogue. When added to cells, C2-ceramide is elongated rapidly to give endogenous and long-chain ceramide (35Ogretmen B. Pettus B.J. Rossi M.J. Wood R. Usta J. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A.

Fig. 1F shows that, as described previously (12Hajduch E. Balendran A. Batty I.H. Litherland G.J. Blair A.S. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Ceramide impairs the insulin-dependent membrane recruitment of protein kinase B leading to a loss in downstream signalling in L6 skeletal muscle cells.Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), 2-h treatment with ceramide inhibits Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin without any negative effect on IRS1. However, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with C2-ceramide for 16 h (at 50 μm, half the concentration we usually use in short-term experiments) decreased insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation and concomitantly increased IRS1 serine 307 phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). A loss of tyrosine 612 phosphorylation of IRS1 was also observed, indicating an inhibition of insulin-induced IRS1 activation (Fig. 1F). These results demonstrate that, in the long term, palmitate-produced ceramide acts negatively on IRS1. Although the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of Akt by ceramide are now well documented (4Hage Hassan R. Bourron O. Hajduch E.

Protein kinase C isoforms: mediators of reactive lipid metabolites in the development of insulin resistance.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), no genuine mechanism has been described to explain how ceramide prevents insulin-induced IRS1 activation in myotubes. We hypothesized that PKR could be a potential candidate to mediate ceramide effects on IRS1. PKR is mainly activated by dimerization and autophosphorylation on at least 15 different sites, but phosphorylation on threonine 451 is critical for its kinase activity (37Romano P.R.

We show here that PKR mRNA (Fig. 2A), PKR phosphorylation on threonine 451, and protein expression (Fig. 2B) were all increased in muscles of HFD mice compared with control mice. In parallel, an increase in phosphorylation of both JNK and eiF2α, two PKR direct targets, was observed in muscle of HFD mice (Fig. 2B). As observed in HFD-fed animals, an increase in PKR mRNA (Fig. 2C), phosphorylation, and expression (Fig. 2D) was observed when C2C12 myotubes were treated with palmitate for 48 h. A 16-h ceramide treatment of C2C12 myotubes induced PKR mRNA expression (Fig. 2E) and phosphorylation on threonine 541 but did not significantly modify total PKR expression (Fig. 2F). We hypothesized that cells had to be exposed to ceramide for a longer period of time to observe an effect on protein expression. Indeed, PKR expression was increased when cells were incubated for at least 24 h with ceramide (data not shown). As a consequence of PKR activation, both JNK and eiF2α were also phosphorylated in response to palmitate or ceramide (Fig. 2, D–F). To study the role of PKR in mediating the long-term effects of ceramide on insulin signaling, we used a well characterized chemical inhibitor of PKR (imoxin), an imidazolo-oxindole derivative that acts as an inhibitor of the PKR A"
https://openalex.org/W2233843360,"The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), result from the combined effects of susceptibility genes and environmental factors. Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in the Toll-like receptor (TLR), the apoptosis, the IL-23/IL-17 and the interferon gamma (IFNG) pathways are associated with risk of both CD and UC.Using a candidate gene approach, 21 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 15 genes were assessed in a clinical homogeneous group of severely diseased ethnic Danish patients consisting of 624 patients with CD, 411 patients with UC and 795 controls. The results were analysed using logistic regression.The polymorphisms TLR5 (rs5744174) and IL12B (rs6887695) were associated with risk of CD, and TLR1 (rs4833095) and IL18 (rs187238) were associated with risk of both CD and UC (p<0.05). After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, the homozygous variant genotype of TLR1 743 T>C (rs4833095) was associated with increased risk CD (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.59-6.26, p = 0.02) and CD and UC combined (OR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.64-5.32, p = 0.005).Our results suggest that genetically determined high activity of TLR1 and TLR5 was associated with increased risk of both CD and UC and CD, respectively. This supports that the host microbial composition or environmental factors in the gut are involved in risk of IBD. Furthermore, genetically determined high activity of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway was associated with increased risk of CD and UC. Overall, our results support that genetically determined high inflammatory response was associated with increased risk of both CD and UC."

Indeed, basic research confirms that although there is much hype in the promotion of RVTL, flavonoids such as RVTL have a wide range of biological effects. We here investigated the effects of RVTL treatment on hippocampal plasticity and memory performance in female Balb/C mice, a strain with low baseline levels of adult neurogenesis. Two weeks of treatment with RVTL (40 mg/kg) induced the production of new neurons in vivo by increasing cell survival and possibly precursor cell proliferation. In addition, RVTL decreased the number of apoptotic cells. The number of doublecortin (DCX)-expressing intermediate cells was increased. RVTL stimulated neuronal differentiation in vitro without effects on proliferation. In the dentate gyrus, RVTL promoted the formation and maturation of spines on granule cell dendrites. RVTL also improved performance in the step down passive avoidance test. The RVTL-treated mice showed increase in the levels of two key signaling proteins, phospho-Akt and phospho-PKC, suggesting the involvement of these signaling pathways. Our results support the vision that flavonoids such as resveratrol deserve further examination as plasticity-inducing compounds in the context of successful cognitive aging."
https://openalex.org/W2212575831,"Background Dietary nitrate supplementation can enhance exercise performance in healthy people, but it is not clear if it is beneficial in COPD. We investigated the hypotheses that acute nitrate dosing would improve exercise performance and reduce the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise in people with COPD. Methods We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over single dose study. Subjects were randomised to consume either nitrate-rich beetroot juice (containing 12.9mmoles nitrate) or placebo (nitrate-depleted beetroot juice) 3 hours prior to endurance cycle ergometry, performed at 70% of maximal workload assessed by a prior incremental exercise test. After a minimum washout period of 7 days the protocol was repeated with the crossover beverage. Results 21 subjects successfully completed the study (age 68±7years; BMI 25.2±5.5kg/m2; FEV1 percentage predicted 50.1±21.6%; peak VO2 18.0±5.9ml/min/kg). Resting diastolic blood pressure fell significantly with nitrate supplementation compared to placebo (-7±8mmHg nitrate vs. -1±8mmHg placebo; p = 0.008). Median endurance time did not differ significantly; nitrate 5.65 (3.90–10.40) minutes vs. placebo 6.40 (4.01–9.67) minutes (p = 0.50). However, isotime oxygen consumption (VO2) was lower following nitrate supplementation (16.6±6.0ml/min/kg nitrate vs. 17.2±6.0ml/min/kg placebo; p = 0.043), and consequently nitrate supplementation caused a significant lowering of the amplitude of the VO2-percentage isotime curve. Conclusions Acute administration of oral nitrate did not enhance endurance exercise performance; however the observation that beetroot juice caused reduced oxygen consumption at isotime suggests that further investigation of this treatment approach is warranted, perhaps targeting a more hypoxic phenotype.

Descriptive statistics, logistic and truncated linear regression models were used to estimate differences between MS patients regarding earnings, disability pension, sickness absence, disability allowance, unemployment compensation, and social assistance.The average level of earnings was ten times lower and the average level of health- related benefits was four times higher when comparing MS patients with severe and mild disability. MS patients with severe disability had on average SEK 166,931 less annual income from earnings and SEK 54,534 more income from benefits compared to those with mild disability. The combined average income for MS patients was 35% lower when comparing patients in the same groups. The adjusted risk ratio for having earnings among MS patients with severe disability compared to the patients with mild disability was 0.33 (95% CI 0.29-0.39), while the risk ratio for having benefits was 1.93 (95% CI 1.90-1.94).Disease progression affects the financial situation of MS patients considerably. Correlations between higher disability and patient income were observed, suggesting that earnings and benefits could be used as measures of MS progression and proxies of disability."

To assist product developers in creating highly acceptable rings, we sought to identify characteristics that intravaginal ring users consider when making decisions about ring use or non-use. We conducted four semi-structured focus groups with 21 women (aged 18-45) who reported using an IVR in the past 12 months. Participants manipulated four prototype rings in their hands, discussed ring materials, dimensionality, and ""behavior,"" and shared perceptions and appraisals. Five salient ring characteristics were identified: 1) appearance of the rings' surfaces, 2) tactile sensations of the cylinder material, 3) materials properties, 4) diameter of the cylinder, and 5) ring circumference. Pliability (or flexibility) was generally considered the most important mechanical property. Several ring properties (e.g., porousness, dimensionality) were associated with perceptions of efficacy. Women also revealed user behaviors that may impact the effectiveness of certain drugs, such as removing, rinsing and re-inserting the ring while bathing, and removing the ring during sexual encounters. As product developers explore IVRs as prevention delivery systems, it is critical to balance product materials and dimensions with use parameters to optimize drug delivery and the user experience. It is also critical to consider how user behaviors (e.g., removing the ring) might impact drug delivery."

Tissue biopsies from a metastatic rib lesion were obtained for sequencing before and after initiating enzalutamide treatment over a twelve-week period and also implanted subcutaneously as well as under the renal capsule in immuno-deficient mice. The genome and transcriptome landscapes of xenografts and the original patient tumor tissues were compared by performing whole exome and transcriptome sequencing of the metastatic tumor tissues and the xenografts at both time points. After comparing the somatic mutations, copy number variations, gene fusions and gene expression we found that the patient’s genomic and transcriptomic alterations were preserved in the patient derived xenografts with high fidelity. These xenograft models provide an opportunity for predicting efficacy of existing and potentially novel drugs that is based on individual metastatic tumor expression signature and molecular pharmacology for delivery of precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2211038295,"The dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) transcription factors have been reported to be involved in stress responses. Most studies have focused on DREB genes in subgroups A-1 and A-2 in herbaceous plants, but there have been few reports on the functions of DREBs from the A-3–A-6 subgroups and in woody plants. Moreover, mulberry trees are ecologically and economically important perennial woody plants, but there has been little research on its stress physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology. In this study, a DREB gene from the mulberry tree, designated as MnDREB4A, classified into the A-4 subgroup by our previous study, was selected for further characterization. Our results showed that the MnDREB4A protein was localized to the nucleus where it activated transcription. The promoter of MnDREB4A can direct prominent expression downstream of the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene under heat, cold, drought and salt stress, and GUS staining was deepest after 12 h of stress treatment. The MnDREB4A-overexpression transgenic tobacco showed the improved growth phenotype under untreated conditions, such as greener leaves, longer roots, and lower water loss and senescence rates. Overexpression of MnDREB4A in tobacco can significantly enhance tolerance to heat, cold, drought, and salt stresses in transgenic plants. The leaf discs and seedlings of transgenic plants reduced leaf wilting and senescence rates compared to the wild type plants under the different stress conditions. Further investigation showed that transgenic plants also had higher water contents and proline contents, and lower malondialdehyde contents under untreated condition and stress conditions. Our results indicate that the MnDREB4A protein plays an important role in plant stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W161981488,"Background The AKT/mTORC1/S6K pathway is frequently overstimulated in breast cancer, constituting a promising therapeutic target. The benefit from mTOR inhibitors varies, likely as a consequence of tumour heterogeneity, and upregulation of several compensatory feed-back mechanisms. The mTORC1 downstream effectors S6K1, S6K2, and 4EBP1 are amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer, associated with a poor outcome and divergent endocrine treatment benefit. S6K1 and S6K2 share high sequence homology, but evidence of partly distinct biological functions is emerging. The aim of this work was to explore possible different roles and treatment target potentials of S6K1 and S6K2 in breast cancer. Materials and methods Whole-genome expression profiles were compared for breast tumours expressing high levels of S6K1, S6K2 or 4EBP1, using public datasets, as well as after in vitro siRNA downregulation of S6K1 and/or S6K2 in ZR751 breast cancer cells. In silico homology modelling of the S6K2 kinase domain was used to evaluate its possible structural divergences to S6K1. Results Genome expression profiles were highly different in S6K1 and S6K2 high tumours, whereas S6K2 and 4EBP1 profiles showed significant overlaps, both correlated to genes involved in cell cycle progression, among these the master regulator E2F1. S6K2 and 4EBP1 were inversely associated with IGF1 levels, and their prognostic value was shown to be restricted to tumours positive for IGFR and/or HER2. In vitro, S6K1 and S6K2 silencing resulted in upregulation of genes in the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Isoform-specific silencing also showed distinct patterns, e.g. S6K2 downregulation lead to upregulation of several cell cycle associated genes. Structural analyses of the S6K2 kinase domain showed unique structure patterns, deviating from those of S6K1, facilitating the development of isoform-specific inhibitors. Our data support emerging proposals of distinct biological features of S6K1 and S6K2, suggesting their importance as separate oncogenes and clinical markers, where specific targeting in different breast cancer subtypes could facilitate further individualised therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2249845711,"Background The disability adjusted life year (DALY) is a composite measure of disease burden that includes both morbidity and mortality, and is relevant to conditions such as epilepsy that can limit productive functioning. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study introduced a number of new methods and definitions, including a prevalence-based approach and revised disability weights to calculate morbidity and new standard life expectancies to calculate premature mortality. We used these approaches, and local, population-based data, to estimate the burden of convulsive epilepsy in rural South Africa. Methods & Findings Comprehensive prevalence, incidence and mortality data on convulsive epilepsy were collected within the Agincourt sub-district in rural northeastern South Africa between 2008 and 2012. We estimated DALYs using both prevalence- and incidence-based approaches for calculating years of life lived with disability. Additionally, we explored how changing the disease model by varying the disability weights influenced DALY estimates. Using the prevalence-based approach, convulsive epilepsy in Agincourt resulted in 332 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 216–455) and 4.1 DALYs per 1,000 individuals (95%UI: 2.7–5.7) annually. Of this, 26% was due to morbidity while 74% was due to premature mortality. DALYs increased by 10% when using the incidence-based method. Varying the disability weight from 0.072 (treated epilepsy, seizure free) to 0.657 (severe epilepsy) caused years lived with disability to increase from 18 (95%UI: 16–19) to 161 (95%UI: 143–170). Conclusions DALY estimates are influenced by both the methods applied and population parameters used in the calculation. Irrespective of method, a significant burden of epilepsy is due to premature mortality in rural South Africa, with a lower burden than rural Kenya. Researchers and national policymakers should carefully interrogate the methods and data used to calculate DALYs as this will influence policy priorities and resource allocation."
https://openalex.org/W2286869347,"Twist1 overexpression is frequently observed in various cancers including gastric cancer (GC). Although DNA methylation of the Twist1 gene has been reported in cancer cells, the mechanisms underlying transcriptional activation remain uncertain. In this study, we first examined epigenetic alterations of the Twist1 using Twist1 transcription-positive and -negative cell lines that are derived from our established diffuse-type GC mouse model. Treatment with a DNA demethylation agent 5-aza-dC re-activated Twist1 expression in Twist1 expression-negative GC cells. According to methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing analysis, methylation at the CpG-rich region within Twist1 coding exon 1, rather than its promoter region, was tightly linked to transcriptional silencing of the Twist1 expression in mouse GC cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that active histone mark H3K4me3 was enriched in Twist1 expression-positive cells, and inactive histone mark H3K9me3 was enriched in Twist1 expression-negative cells. The expression levels of Suv39h1 and Suv39h2, histone methyltransferases for H3K9me3, were inversely correlated with Twist1 expression, and knockdown of Suv39h1 or Suv39h2 induced Twist1 expression. Moreover, Sp1 transcription factor bound to the exon 1 CpG-rich region in Twist1 expression-positive cell lines, and Twist1 expression was diminished by mithramycin, which that interferes with Sp1 binding to CpG-rich regulatory sequences. Our studies suggested that the Twist1 transcription in GC cells might be regulated through potential cooperation of DNA methylation, histone modification in complex with Sp1 binding to CpG-rich regions within the exon 1 region."
https://openalex.org/W2214132493,"For a better understanding of the systemic effect of sub-lethal micromolar concentrations of ionic silver on Escherichia coli, we performed a multi-level characterization of cells under Ag+-mediated stress using an integrative biology approach combining physiological, biochemical and transcriptomic data. Physiological parameters, namely bacterial growth and survival after Ag+ exposure, were first quantified and related to the accumulation of intracellular silver, probed for the first time by nano secondary ion mass spectroscopy at sub-micrometer lateral resolution. Modifications in E. coli biochemical composition were evaluated under Ag+-mediated stress by in situ synchrotron Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy and a comprehensive transcriptome response was also determined. Using multivariate statistics, correlations between the physiological parameters, the extracellular concentration of AgNO3 and the intracellular silver content, gene expression profiles and micro-spectroscopic data were investigated. We identified Ag+-dependent regulation of gene expression required for growth (e.g. transporter genes, transcriptional regulators, ribosomal proteins), for ionic silver transport and detoxification (e.g. copA, cueO, mgtA, nhaR) and for coping with various types of stress (dnaK, pspA, metA,R, oxidoreductase genes). The silver-induced shortening of the acyl chain of fatty acids, mostly encountered in cell membrane, was highlighted by microspectroscopy and correlated with the down-regulated expression of genes involved in fatty acid transport (fadL) and synthesis/modification of lipid A (lpxA and arnA). The increase in the disordered secondary structure of proteins in the presence of Ag+ was assessed through the conformational shift shown for amides I and II, and further correlated with the up-regulated expression of peptidase (hfq) and chaperone (dnaJ), and regulation of transpeptidase expression (ycfS and ycbB). Interestingly, as these transpeptidases act on the structural integrity of the cell wall, regulation of their expression may explain the morphological damage reported under Ag+-mediated stress.

An endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase-2A, inhibitor-1, I1PP2A, which inhibits the phosphatase activity by interacting with its catalytic subunit protein phosphatase-2Ac, is known to be upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease brain. In the present study, we overexpressed I1PP2A by intracerebroventricular injection with adeno-associated virus vector-1-I1PP2A in Wistar rats. The I1PP2A rats showed a decrease in brain protein phosphatase-2A activity, abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, neurodegeneration, an increase in the level of activated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, enhanced expression of intraneuronal amyloid-beta and spatial reference memory deficit; littermates treated identically but with vector only, i.e., adeno-associated virus vector-1-enhanced GFP, served as a control. Treatment with memantine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist which is an approved drug for treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, rescued protein phosphatase-2A activity by decreasing its demethylation at Leu309 selectively and attenuated Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology and cognitive impairment in adeno-associated virus vector-1-I1PP2A rats. These findings provide new clues into the possible mechanism of the beneficial therapeutic effect of memantine in Alzheimer’s disease patients."
https://openalex.org/W2215783940,"Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is an important component that affects the structure and function of different terrestrial ecosystem worldwide. However, much uncertainty still remains concerning the magnitude of N deposition on grassland ecosystem in China. To study the spatial and temporal patterns of bulk N deposition, the levels of N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) concentration in rainfall were measured at 12 sites across a 1200 km grassland transect in Inner Mongolia, China, and the respective N deposition rates were estimated. The inorganic N deposition rates ranged from 4.53 kg N ha-1 to 12.21 kg N ha-1 with a mean value of 8.07 kg N ha-1 during the entire growing season, decreasing steadily from the eastern to the western regions. Inorganic N deposition occurred mainly in July and August across meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe, which corresponded to the seasonal distribution of mean annual precipitation. A positive relationship was found between inorganic N deposition and mean annual precipitation (R2 = 0.54 ~ 0.72, P < 0.0001) across the grassland transect. Annual estimation of inorganic N deposition was 0.67 Pg yr-1 in Inner Mongolia, China based on the correlation between N deposition rates and precipitation. N deposition was an important factor controlling aboveground biomass and ecosystem respiration, but has no effect on root biomass and soil respiration. We must clarify that we used the bulk deposition samplers during the entire sampling process and estimated the dissolved NH4+-N and NO3--N deposition rates during the entire growing season. Long-term N deposition monitoring networks should be constructed to study the patterns of N deposition and its potential effect on grassland ecosystem, considering various N species, i.e., gaseous N, particle N, and wet N deposition."
https://openalex.org/W2215904362,"Serotonin is a ubiquitous chemical transmitter with particularly important roles in the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Modulation of serotonergic signaling occurs, in part, by uptake of the transmitter by the serotonin transporter (SERT). In the brain, SERT is the target for numerous antidepressants including tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Despite the importance of SERT in human physiology, biochemical, biophysical and high-resolution structural studies have been hampered due to the instability of SERT in detergent micelles. To identify a human SERT (hSERT) construct suitable for detailed biochemical and structural studies, we developed an efficient thermostability screening protocol and rapidly screened 219 mutations for thermostabilization of hSERT in complex with the SSRI paroxetine. We discovered three mutations-Y110A, I291A and T439S -that, when combined into a single construct, deemed TS3, yielded a hSERT variant with an apparent melting temperature (Tm) 19°C greater than that of the wild-type transporter, albeit with a loss of transport activity. Further investigation yielded a double mutant-I291A and T439S-defined as TS2, with a 12°C increase in Tm and retention of robust transport activity. Both TS2 and TS3 were more stable in short-chain detergents in comparison to the wild-type transporter. This thermostability screening protocol, as well as the specific hSERT variants, will prove useful in studies of other integral membrane receptors and transporters and in the investigation of structure and function relationships in hSERT."
https://openalex.org/W2259085538,"Background A widely held concern of screening is that its psychological harms may outweigh the benefits of early detection and treatment. This study describes pregnant women's perceptions of possible harms and benefits of mental health screening and factors associated with identifying screening as harmful or beneficial. Methods This study analyzed a subgroup of women who had undergone formal or informal mental health screening from our larger multi-site, cross-sectional study. Pregnant women >16 years of age who spoke/read English were recruited (May-December 2013) from prenatal classes and maternity clinics in Alberta, Canada. Descriptive statistics were generated to summarize harms and benefits of screening and multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with reporting at least one harm or affirming screening as a positive experience (January-December 2014). Results Overall study participation rate was 92% (N = 460/500). Among women screened for mental health concerns (n = 238), 63% viewed screening as positive, 69% were glad to be asked, and 87% took it as evidence their provider cared about them. Only one woman identified screening as a negative experience. Of the 6 harms, none was endorsed by >7% of women, with embarrassment being most cited. Women who were very comfortable (vs somewhat/not comfortable) with screening were more likely to report it as a positive experience. Limitations Women were largely Caucasian, well-educated, partnered women; thus, findings may not be generalizable to women with socioeconomic risk. Conclusions Most women perceived prenatal mental health screening as having high benefit and low harm. These findings dispel popular concerns that mental health screening is psychologically harmful."
https://openalex.org/W2198136420,"Perhaps one of the most astounding characteristics of the gecko adhesive system is its versatility. Geckos can locomote across complex substrates in a variety of conditions with apparent ease. In contrast, many of our synthetic pressure sensitive adhesives fail on substrates that are dirty, wet or rough. Although many studies have investigated the effect of environmental challenges on performance, the interaction of multiple, potentially compromising variables is studied less often. Here we focus on substrate structure and surface water, both of which are highly relevant to the biological system and to synthetic design. To do this we utilized a highly controlled, patterned substrate (Sharklet®, by Sharklet® Technologies Inc.). This allowed us to test independently and jointly the effects of reduced surface area substrates, with a defined pattern, on adhesion in both air and water. Our results show that adhesion is not significantly impaired in air, whereas surface area and pattern significantly affect adhesion in water. These findings highlight the need to study multiple parameters that are relevant to the gecko adhesive system to further improve our understanding of the biological system and to design better, more versatile synthetics."
https://openalex.org/W2205762156,"Protein modification by small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMOs) is essential and conserved in the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. We have previously shown that interactions between the SUMO E1-activating and E2-conjugating enzyme in P. falciparum are distinct compared with human, suggesting a potential target for development of parasite-specific inhibitors of SUMOylation. The parasite asexual trophozoite stage is susceptible to iron-induced oxidative stress and is subsequently a target for many of the current anti-malarial drugs.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus, Plasmodium. There are five species of Plasmodium that infect humans, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most deadly. During 2013, there were 200 million cases of malaria worldwide, leading to >500,000 deaths (1World Health Organization World Malaria Report 2014. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2014Crossref Google Scholar). Because of the complex nature of malaria infection, control measures require integrated approaches that span vector control, vaccine development, and anti-malarial drug treatments. Current drug therapy regimens rely on artemisinin-based combination therapy; however, artemisinin resistance has begun to spread throughout southeast Asia (1World Health Organization World Malaria Report 2014. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2014Crossref Google Scholar). The development of resistance to first line anti-malarial drugs has accelerated the need for new drugs with novel targets for effective malaria treatment. The life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite requires infection of an Anopheles mosquito and subsequent transmission to a human host (2Miller L.H. Ackerman H.C. Su X.Z. Wellems T.E. Malaria biology and disease pathogenesis: insights for new treatments.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Infected mosquitoes inject motile sporozoites that travel to the liver through the bloodstream, where they proliferate in hepatocytes. After multiple rounds of syncytial division, or schizogony, merozoites are released into the bloodstream where they invade erythrocytes and undergo asexual replication. The intraerythrocyte developmental cycle consists of three distinct stages: single invasion of a red blood cell producing a ring stage parasite, a trophozoite stage characterized by host hemoglobin digestion, and successive rounds of mitosis to produce a multinucleated schizont. Ruptured erythrocytes release merozoites for subsequent invasion into new red blood cells. Sexual gametes are also produced during the intraerythrocyte developmental cycle and are taken up by mosquitoes during a blood meal, completing the life cycle of the parasite in the mosquito midgut. The complex life cycle of Plasmodium requires tight regulation to coordinate the stage specific functions and remodeling that must occur to maintain infectivity. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) 2The abbreviations used are: PTM, post-translational modification; SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; Ufd, ubiquitin fold domain; H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; DCF, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein; Ubl, ubiquitin-like. provide one method for spatial and temporal control of cellular activities. Several PTMs have been described in Plasmodium, including: SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, neddylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, nitrosylation, lipidation, and methylation (3Issar N. Roux E.

Microbiol. 2015; 13: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Because of the important role of PTMs in cell division, regulating protein localization and activity, as well as protein-protein interactions, several efforts have focused on disrupting these pathways (7Karve T.M. Cheema A.K. Small changes huge impact: the role of protein posttranslational modifications in cellular homeostasis and disease.J. Amino Acids. 2011; 2011: 207691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reversible covalent attachment to proteins mediated by these PTMs requires the action of specific conjugation and deconjugation machinery. Because these pathways are essential and functionally conserved in the parasite, thorough characterization must be performed to determine differences between Plasmodium and human proteins that could be targeted for parasite-specific inhibition. Protein modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) is essential for normal cellular function, including stress response, transcription, cell division, DNA replication and repair, and ion transport and utilizes a conserved cascade of enzymes (8Geiss-Friedlander R. Melchior F. Concepts in sumoylation: a decade on.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). There are four SUMO paralogs in humans, whereas P. falciparum encodes only one. SUMO is expressed as an inactive precursor that is processed by a SUMO-specific protease, revealing a C-terminal diglycine motif. A heterodimeric E1-activating enzyme (Aos1/Uba2) adenylates the C terminus of mature SUMO and then transfers SUMO to the catalytic cysteine of Uba2, forming a covalent thioester linkage. The sole SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 interacts with the ubiquitin fold domain (Ufd) of the E1 Uba2 subunit to promote transfer of SUMO and formation of a thioester linkage with the E2 catalytic cysteine. Modification of target proteins occurs upon Ubc9 recognition of a consensus motif, ΨKXE, where Ψ is a hydrophobic residue, K is the acceptor lysine, and X is any amino acid, found on substrates. The covalent attachment to the ϵ-amino group of a substrate lysine residue can be mediated in either an E3 ligase-independent or -dependent manner. The removal of SUMO is catalyzed by SUMO specific isopeptidases, leading to a dynamic balance of SUMO conjugation and deconjugation. Protective roles for SUMOylation in the oxidative stress response have been described previously in organisms from yeast to human, but whether it plays a role during the parasite stress response remains largely uncharacterized (9Conti L. Kioumourtzoglou D. O'Donnell E. Dominy P. Sadanandom A. OTS1 and OTS2 SUMO proteases link plant development and survival under salt stress.Plant Signal.

Blood Flow Metab. 2007; 27: 950-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We previously showed that SUMOylation levels peak during the trophozoite stage of the intraerythrocyte developmental cycle, which is characterized by enhanced oxidative stress caused by parasite digestion of host hemoglobin (12Reiter K. Mukhopadhyay D. Zhang H. Boucher L.E. Kumar N. Bosch J. Matunis M.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 27724-27736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Notably, anti-malarials, such as chloroquine and artemisinin, are thought to kill parasites at least in part by overloading oxidative stress response pathways (13Meshnick S.R. Thomas A. Ranz A. Xu C.M. Pan H.Z. Artemisinin (qinghaosu): the role of intracellular hemin in its mechanism of antimalarial action.Mol. Biochem.

On the molecular mechanism of chloroquine's antimalarial action.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11865-11870Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Here, we determine that SUMOylation is modulated in response to levels of oxidative stress, providing further evidence for a role in the parasite stress response. The development of parasite-specific SUMOylation inhibitors could provide a novel synergistic therapy, as resistance to the first line anti-malarial, artemisinin, begins to spread. The SUMO conjugation machinery is conserved in P. falciparum; however, we have previously determined that the surface residues important for interactions between the E1-activating and E2-conjugating enzymes have diverged significantly from humans (12Reiter K. Mukhopadhyay D. Zhang H. Boucher L.E. Kumar N. Bosch J. Matunis M.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 27724-27736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of human and P. falciparum Ubc9 chimeric proteins revealed that residues comprising the α1 helix and β1-β2 loop are critical for functional and also species-specific interactions with cognate E1-activating enzymes. These residues are predicted to make direct contacts with the Uba2 Ufd domain. However, the specific contribution that individual residues within the α1 helix and β1-β2 loop of Ubc9 play in E1 binding remained unknown. To more fully define the molecular basis for species-specific E1-E2 interactions, we solved the structure of the human Uba2Ufd-Ubc9 complex. We also used molecular modeling to guide mutagenesis of the predicted Plasmodium Uba2Ufd-Ubc9 interaction surface and analyzed effects of specific mutations on binding and conjugation in vitro. Our findings identified residues involved in Uba2Ufd-Ubc9 binding that underlie parasite-specific E1-E2 interactions and that could aid in develop of parasite-specific inhibitors of SUMOylation. Parasites were cultured using a modified standard procedure in human O+ erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit in 3% CO2, 3% O2, 94% N2 atmosphere at 37 °C (15Trager W. Jensen J.B. Human malaria parasites in continuous culture.Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6161) Google Scholar). Complete malaria culture media consisted of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, 0.2% sodium bicarbonate (Invitrogen), 12.5 μg/ml hypoxanthine (Sigma), and 5 mg/ml AlbuMAX II (Life Technologies). Dd2attB strain parasites were grown as described above; synchronized with one cycle of sorbitol treatment at the ring stage, as described; and allowed to mature to schizonts (12Reiter K.

Purified trophozoites were pooled into two sample sets for flow cytometry and Western blot analysis, respectively. Samples were treated the same except Western blot samples were incubated in malaria culture media while the flow samples were being incubated in 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA). For flow cytometry, parasites were labeled with 5 μm H2DCFDA for 30 min in the dark at 37 °C and washed with culture media. Parasites were treated with artemisinin (100, 250, and 500 nm) for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed and harvested for Western blot analysis at this point. Samples for flow cytometry were further labeled with 0.5 μm SYTO61 for 45 min at room temperature. The samples were washed in malaria culture media and diluted to 0.025% hematocrit. Flow cytometry measurements were performed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. Samples were excited at 488 nm (DCF; 530/30 nm bandpass filter) and 633 nm (SYTO61; 660/20 nm bandpass filter). 250,000 events were recorded based on forward versus side scatter plots. Analysis was performed using FlowJo, and trophozoites were gated based on SYTO61 signal. The median DCF signal was reported. For Western blot analysis, treated parasites were harvested via saponin lysis, as previously described (12Reiter K. Mukhopadhyay D. Zhang H. Boucher L.E. Kumar N. Bosch J. Matunis M.J.

The HsUba2Ufd-HsUbc9 complex was purified using a Superdex 75 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. Crystallization screening was performed using a Mosquito Crystallization Robot (TTP Labtech, Cambridge, MA). Diffraction quality crystals were grown at 20 °C using the sitting drop method, with each drop containing a mixture of 200 nl of complex (10 mg/ml), 20 nl of seed crystals from 200 mm sodium formate, 20% PEG3350, and 200 nl of buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% PEG 550 monomethyl ether, 200 mm potassium formate, 20% glycerol) from the 60 μl of buffer well.

The soluble sample was passed over glutathione agarose beads (Pierce). Uba2Ufd samples were eluted with 20 mm glutathione, and GST tags were cleaved from Ubc9 samples using on-column cleavage with Prescission Protease. Samples were further purified on a Superdex 75 size exclusion column. The folding of mutants with reduced binding and conjugation activity was assessed by CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter provided with a PFD-425S temperature controller and a thermostatic cell compartment. The Spectra Manager software J-800 was used for signal averaging and processing. The spectra were registered at 25 °C in the range of 185–260 nm with a scanning speed of 100 nm min−1 in 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The average of three scans was reported. Glutathione beads (Pierce) were washed with assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with 33 μg of GST-Uba2Ufd (total protein) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were blocked in assay buffer containing 2% BSA for 1 h at 25 °C and washed twice with assay buffer. The E1-E2 binding reaction was performed in 500 μl of assay buffer with 9.9 μg of untagged E2 and rocked for 2 h at room temperature. The samples were washed four times and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Modification assays using recombinant RanGAP1 were performed in 20-μl reactions containing 1 μm GST-RanGAP1 (residues 419–589), 5 μm PfSUMO, 50 nm PfE1, 100 nm PfE2, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 0.6 unit/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase, 0.6 unit/ml creatine phosphokinase, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm Mg(Ac)2, 110 mm KAc, 5 mm ATP. (We have observed that the 2.5-fold excess of ATP over Mg2+ in our reaction does not significantly inhibit conjugation.) The reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots were combined with sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis. Membranes were probed with 1:500 mAb GST for 1 h at room temperature (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:15,000; goat-anti mouse; Jackson ImmunoResearch) was detected by ECL Prime (GE Healthcare). The reactions were linear during the first 15 min of the assay, as assessed by ImageJ analysis of band intensities. SUMOylation levels peak during the intraerythrocyte developmental cycle trophozoite stage, concomitant with increased oxidative stress caused by hemoglobin degradation (12Reiter K. Mukhopadhyay D. Zhang H. Boucher L.E. Kumar N. Bosch J. Matunis M.J. Identification of biochemically distinct properties of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) conjugation pathway in Plasmodium falciparum.J.

To more systematically investigate how SUMOylation levels respond to changes in oxidative stress, we synchronized Dd2attB parasites to enrich for trophozoites and treated cultures with a pro-oxidant anti-malarial drug, artemisinin, for 2 h. To assess the effects of artemisinin treatments on parasite oxidative stress levels, we used the cell-permeable reactive oxygen species reporter dye H2DCFDA in culture during our treatments. Reactive oxygen species production converts the nonfluorescent H2DCFDA molecule into a highly fluorescent product, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). Treated parasites were stained with the DNA-binding dye, SYTO-61, to distinguish trophozoite stage parasites and analyzed by flow cytometry. Trophozoite stage parasites showed a 30% increase in DCF fluorescence following artemisinin treatment, consistent with predicted increases in oxidative stress and comparable to changes in DCF signal previously reported in P. falciparum (Fig. 1A) (24Klonis N.

To investigate how SUMOylation is affected by changes in oxidative stress, we next performed immunoblot analysis on trophozoite stage parasites purified from untreated control cultures and cultures treated with increasing doses of artemisinin. Immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal PfSUMO antibody revealed a smear of high molecular mass conjugates in untreated control parasites and minor levels of free SUMO, as previously reported (Fig. 1B) (12Reiter K.

In contrast, we detected a dose-dependent reduction in free SUMO and a concomitant shift to higher molecular mass conjugates in lysates prepared from parasites treated with artemisinin.

Our findings were based on functional assays and preliminary structural analysis of predicted molecular complexes of Uba2Ufd and Ubc9 from human and P. falciparum. To assess in greater detail the structural differences mediating species-specific E1-E2 interactions, a crystal structure of the human Uba2Ufd (HsUba2Ufd), corresponding to residues 444–561, in complex with human Ubc9 (HsUbc9), was determined at 2.5 Å resolution (Table 1). Molecular replacement using previous individually solved structures of HsUbc9 (Protein Data Bank code 1U9B) and S. cerevisiae Uba2Ufd (ScUba2Ufd) (Protein Data Bank code 3ONG) was used to obtain initial phases (17Giraud M.F.

https://openalex.org/W2208346011,"ApoE deficiency in mice (Apoe−/−) results in severe hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. In diet-induced obesity, Apoe−/− display steatohepatitis but reduced accumulation of triacylglycerides and enhanced insulin sensitivity in white adipose tissue (WAT). Although the vast majority of apoE is expressed by hepatocytes apoE is also abundantly expressed in WAT. As liver and adipose tissue play important roles for metabolism, this study aims to outline functions of both hepatocyte- and adipocyte-derived apoE separately by investigating a novel mouse model of tissue-specific apoE deficiency. Therefore we generated transgenic mice carrying homozygous floxed Apoe alleles. Mice lacking apoE either in hepatocytes (ApoeΔHep) or in adipose tissue (ApoeΔAT) were fed experimental diets. ApoeΔHep exhibited slightly higher body weights, adiposity and liver weights on diabetogenic high fat diet (HFD). Accordingly, hepatic steatosis and markers of inflammation were more pronounced compared to controls. Hypercholesterolemia evoked by lipoprotein remnant accumulation was present in ApoeΔHep mice fed a Western type diet (WTD). Lipidation of VLDL particles and tissue uptake of VLDL were disturbed in ApoeΔHep while the plasma clearance rate remained unaltered. ApoeΔAT did not display any detectable phenotype, neither on HFD nor on WTD. In conclusion, our novel conditional apoE deletion model has proven here the role of hepatocyte apoE for VLDL production and diet-induced dyslipidemia. Specific deletion of apoE in adipocytes cannot reproduce the adipose phenotype of global Apoe−/− mice, suggesting that apoE produced in other cell types than hepatocytes or adipocytes explains the lean and insulin-sensitive phenotype described for Apoe−/− mice."
https://openalex.org/W2258865442,"Termites are eusocial insects related to cockroaches that feed on lignocellulose. These insects are key species in ecosystems since they recycle a large amount of nutrients but also are pests, exerting major economic impacts. Knowledge on the molecular pathways underlying reproduction, caste differentiation or lignocellulose digestion would largely benefit from additional transcriptomic data. This study focused on transcriptomes of secondary reproductive females (nymphoid neotenics). Thirteen transcriptomes were used: 10 of Reticulitermes flavipes and R. grassei sequenced from a previous study, and two transcriptomes of R. lucifugus sequenced for the present study. After transcriptome assembly and read mapping, we examined interspecific variations of genes expressed by termites or gut microorganisms. A total of 18,323 orthologous gene clusters were detected. Functional annotation and taxonomic assignment were performed on a total of 41,287 predicted contigs in the three termite species. Between the termite species studied, functional categories of genes were comparable. Gene ontology (GO) terms analysis allowed the discovery of 9 cellulases and a total of 79 contigs potentially involved in 11 enzymatic activities used in wood metabolism. Altogether, results of this study illustrate the strong potential for the use of comparative interspecific transcriptomes, representing a complete resource for future studies including differentially expressed genes between castes or SNP analysis for population genetics."
https://openalex.org/W2210495701,"Understanding alterations in HIV-specific immune responses during antiretroviral therapy (ART), such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), is important in the development of novel strategies to control HIV-1 infection. This study included 53 HIV-1 positive individuals. We evaluated the ability of effector cells and antibodies to mediate ADCC separately and in combination using the ADCC-PanToxiLux assay. The ability of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to mediate ADCC was significantly higher in individuals who had been treated with ART before seroconversion, compared to the individuals initiating ART at a low CD4+ T cell count (<350 cells/μl blood) and the ART-naïve individuals. The frequency of CD16 expressing natural killer (NK) cells correlated with both the duration of ART and Granzyme B (GzB) activity. In contrast, the plasma titer of antibodies mediating ADCC declined during ART. These findings suggest improved cytotoxic function of the NK cells if initiating ART early during infection, while the levels of ADCC mediating antibodies declined during ART."
https://openalex.org/W2218941108,"Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is a highly heritable trait, but genome-wide association studies have identified few genetic risk factors. Epidemiological studies suggest associations between BMD and several traits and diseases, but the nature of the suggestive comorbidity is still unknown. We used a novel genetic pleiotropy-informed conditional False Discovery Rate (FDR) method to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMD by leveraging cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated disorders and metabolic traits. By conditioning on SNPs associated with the CVD-related phenotypes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides and waist hip ratio, we identified 65 novel independent BMD loci (26 with femoral neck BMD and 47 with lumbar spine BMD) at conditional FDR < 0.01. Many of the loci were confirmed in genetic expression studies. Genes validated at the mRNA levels were characteristic for the osteoblast/osteocyte lineage, Wnt signaling pathway and bone metabolism. The results provide new insight into genetic mechanisms of variability in BMD, and a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of clinical comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2207694898,"In prokaryotes simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with unit sizes of 1-5 nucleotides (nt) are causative for phase and antigenic variation. Although an increased abundance of heptameric repeats was noticed in bacteria, reports about SSRs of 6-9 nt are rare. In particular G-rich repeat sequences with the propensity to fold into G-quadruplex (G4) structures have received little attention. In silico analysis of prokaryotic genomes show putative G4 forming sequences to be abundant. This report focuses on a surprisingly enriched G-rich repeat of the type GGGNATC in Xanthomonas and cyanobacteria such as Nostoc. We studied in detail the genomes of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris ATCC 33913 (Xcc), Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri str. 306 (Xac), and Nostoc sp. strain PCC7120 (Ana). In all three organisms repeats are spread all over the genome with an over-representation in non-coding regions. Extensive variation of the number of repetitive units was observed with repeat numbers ranging from two up to 26 units. However a clear preference for four units was detected. The strong bias for four units coincides with the requirement of four consecutive G-tracts for G4 formation. Evidence for G4 formation of the consensus repeat sequences was found in biophysical studies utilizing CD spectroscopy. The G-rich repeats are preferably located between aligned open reading frames (ORFs) and are under-represented in coding regions or between divergent ORFs. The G-rich repeats are preferentially located within a distance of 50 bp upstream of an ORF on the anti-sense strand or within 50 bp from the stop codon on the sense strand. Analysis of whole transcriptome sequence data showed that the majority of repeat sequences are transcribed. The genetic loci in the vicinity of repeat regions show increased genomic stability. In conclusion, we introduce and characterize a special class of highly abundant and wide-spread quadruplex-forming repeat sequences in bacteria."

To achieve this, the understanding of the immunological parameters that mediate such broad protection is crucial.In the current study we assessed the contribution of humoral and cellular immune responses to heterosubtypic protection against H5N1 induced by a Matrix-M (MM) adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine by serum transfer and T-cell depletion studies.We demonstrate that the heterosubtypic protection against H5N1 induced by MM adjuvanted vaccine is partially mediated by antibodies. The serum contained both H5N1 cross-reactive hemagglutinin (HA)- and neuraminidase (NA)-specific antibodies but with limited virus neutralizing and no hemagglutination inhibiting activity. The cross-reactive antibodies induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro, suggesting a role for the Fc part of the antibodies in protection against H5N1. Besides H5N1 specific antibody responses, cross-reactive HA- and NA-specific T-cell responses were induced by the adjuvanted vaccine. T-cell depletion experiments demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contribute to protection.Our study demonstrates that cross-protection against H5N1 induced by MM adjuvanted seasonal virosomal influenza vaccine requires both the humoral and cellular arm of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W2274229928,"As nutrition-related expenses constitute the majority of the costs for aquaculture farms, it is essential for them to use feeds that provide an ideal combination of nutrients for the species of choice. In this study, the relative effect of consuming three different pelleted feeds (B, C and D) in comparison to frozen baitfish (A; control) were compared on juvenile Asian seabass (77.3 ± 22.4g) that were selected for increased growth rate over two generations. Our objectives were: 1) to evaluate the effects of different pelleted feeds based on overall physiological changes and nutritional quality of fillets; 2) improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms with transcriptomic analysis; 3) if possible, identify the feed type that supports the growth of these fishes without substantially reducing the nutritional quality of fillet. The growth performance, fatty acid composition of fillet, hepatic histology and transcriptome of the fishes (Groups A-D) were analyzed. The majority of fatty acids of the fillets, except γ-linolenic acid (GLA, C18:3n6), correlated significantly with the respective diets. Asian seabass fed Feed C showed highest specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion efficiency (FCE) with closest histology and transcriptomic profile to control, but their fillet contained the highest n6/n3 ratio. When the liver-based transcriptomes were analyzed, a complex set of differentially expressed genes were detected between groups fed pelleted feeds and controls as well as among the pellet-fed groups themselves. Significant enrichment of genes with growth-related function tallied with the morphological data measured. When compared with control (Group A), ‘Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids’ and ‘Steroid biosynthesis’ pathways were significantly enriched in pellet-fed groups. Reduced goblet cell numbers were observed in the gut of pellet-fed fish compared to controls and fads6 was found to be a suitable candidate gene to separate wild-caught Asian seabass, from pellet-fed ones. These results provide insights for researchers on the various effects of feeds on the biochemistry and global gene expression of the fish and potentially for seabass farms to make more informed feed choices."

Identifying patients with risk of not fulfilling HIV-testing follow-up completion (FC), among patients demanding non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP), may improve clinical practice.A retrospective chart review was conducted in a single French HIV-infection care center. FC predictors were assessed in a multivariate logistic regression model (Likelihood ratios test).Between 2009 and 2013, 646 sexual exposures to HIV were evaluated for nPEP, of which 507 effectively received nPEP (78%). FC rate was 30% (194/646). In the multivariate analysis, FC rates rose with age of exposed individuals (OR, 1.04 [0.25-4.28]; p<0.001) and decreased with the year of sexual exposure (OR, 0.74 [0.65-0.85]; p<0.001). FC was associated with sexual encounter with a sex worker (OR, 4.07 [0.98-16.82]; p<0.001) and nPEP use (OR, 2.69 [2.37-3.06]; p<0.001). nPEP early discontinuation was associated with decreased FC rates (OR, 0.18 [0.08-0.39]; p<0.001). No documented nPEP failure was identified. However, five Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) nPEP recipients for unprotected anal receptive intercourse subsequently seroconverted to HIV more than 6 months after nPEP. Seroconversion to HIV was associated with the lack of FC (p = 0.04) and multiple presentations for nPEP over the study period (p = 0.002).We identified significant predictors of not fulfilling sequential HIV-testing. They appear to be linked with a self-perceived HIV risk, especially in young adults recently exposed. Enhanced counseling in targeted individuals with high risk behaviors and using smartphone and internet-based strategies may be interesting retention in care options."
https://openalex.org/W2418511897,"CreBC is a highly conserved two-component regulatory system (TCS) in several gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. CreD is a conserved gene that encodes a predicted inner-membrane protein and is located near the creBC loci. Activation of CreBC increases creD expression; therefore, creD expression is generally used as a measure of CreBC activation in E. coli, Aeromonas spp., and P. aeruginosa systems. In this article, we aim to elucidate the expression of creD and further to investigate its functions in S. maltophilia. In spite of a short intergenic region of 81 bp between creBC and creD, creD is expressed separately from the adjacent creBC operon and from a promoter immediately upstream of creD (PcreD) in S. maltophilia. We found that the promoter activity of PcreD is negatively regulated by the creBC TCS, positively regulated by the bacterial culture density, and not affected by β-lactams. Furthermore, creD expression is not significantly altered in the presence of the phosphor-mimic variant of CreB, CreB(D55E), which mimics activated CreB. The functions of CreD of S. maltophilia were assessed by comparison among the following: wild-type KJ; the creD isogenic mutant, KJΔCreD; and the complementary strain, KJΔCreD(pCreD). The mutant lacking creD had cell division defects and aberrations in cell envelope integrity, which then triggered the σE-mediated envelope stress response. Thus, the results indicated that CreD plays a critical role in the maintenance of envelope integrity."

Among these substances, endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) present a threat, although the environmental significance of these compounds remains largely unknown. To shed some light on this field, we assessed the effects of 17β-oestradiol on the growth, reproduction and formation of free radicals in Eisenia fetida.Although the observed effects on growth and survival were relatively weak, a strong impact on reproduction was observed (50.70% inhibition in 100 μg/kg of E2). We further demonstrated that the exposure of the earthworm Eisenia fetida to a contaminant of emerging concern, 17β-oestradiol (E2), significantly affected the molecules involved in antioxidant defence. Exposure to E2 results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the stimulation of antioxidant systems (metallothionein and reduced oxidized glutathione ratio) but not phytochelatins at both the mRNA and translated protein levels. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-imaging revealed the subcuticular bioaccumulation of oestradiol-3,4-quinone, altering the levels of local antioxidants in a time-dependent manner.The present study illustrates that although most invertebrates do not possess oestrogen receptors, these organisms can be affected by oestrogen hormones, likely reflecting free diffusion into the cellular microenvironment with subsequent degradation to molecules that undergo redox cycling, producing ROS, thereby increasing environmental contamination that also perilously affects keystone animals, forming lower trophic levels."

The mutated Asp residue, which determines the disease phenotype, is conserved in all eukaryotic members of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. Studies of the mutant acetylcholine receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells reveal that δD140N attenuates cell surface expression and apparent channel gating, predicting a reduced magnitude and an accelerated decay of the synaptic response, thus reducing the safety margin for neuromuscular transmission. Substituting Asn for Asp at equivalent positions in the α-, β-, and ϵ-subunits also suppresses apparent channel gating, but the suppression is much greater in the α-subunit.

Congenital myasthenic syndromes are heterogeneous disorders in which the safety margin of neuromuscular transmission is compromised by one or more specific mechanisms. Although no fewer than 20 congenital myasthenic syndrome disease genes have been identified, most congenital myasthenic syndromes arise from mutations in muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) 2The abbreviations used are: AChRacetylcholine receptorAChacetylcholineM1M2, M3, and M4, a transmembrane domain of the first, second, third, and fourth α-helix of AChR, respectivelyHEKhuman embryonic kidneyMEPCminiature endplate currentEPendplateα-bgtbungarotoxin. subunits (1Engel A.G.

The muscle AChR belongs to the cystine-loop (Cys-loop) superfamily of receptors and is a heteropentamer composed of homologous subunits with stoichiometry (α1)2β1δγ in fetal and (α1)2β1δϵ in adult muscle (2Karlin A.

The AChR Cys-loop divides the inner from the outer β-sheets of the extracellular domain and is situated at the interface between the extracellular and pore domains. Its name derives from a disulfide bond between a pair of cysteine residues separated by 13 residues, four of which are highly conserved. One of these conserved residues, Asp-138 in the muscle AChR α-subunit, is present at equivalent positions in all subtypes and species of AChR subunits (Fig. 1A) and also across all subunits of all species of the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. However, little is known about the contributions of the Cys-loop Asp of the different subunits to AChR expression and AChR activation. Recent crystal structures of eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors show that the residue equivalent to αAsp-138 localizes within the hydrophobic core of the subunit, where it establishes electrostatic contact with an invariant cationic residue equivalent to αArg-209 in the pre-M1 domain of the muscle AChR (3Hibbs R.E. Gouaux E. Principles of activation and permeation in an anion-selective Cys-loop receptor.Nature. 2011; 474: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In addition, anionic residues from the β1-2 and β8-9 loops interact with the residue equivalent to αArg-209 (4Lee W.Y. Sine S.M.

All of these studies used macroscopic current measurements to assess function of the mutant receptors, and although functional interdependence of the residue pairs was demonstrated, functional consequences of the mutations at the level of individual receptor channels were not investigated. Here we identify a mutation of the invariant Cys-loop Asp residue in the AChR δ-subunit in a patient with myasthenic symptoms since birth and analyze the consequences of the mutation at the level of individual receptor channels. Furthermore, we examine functional consequences of the Asp-to-Asn mutation at equivalent positions of the AChR α-, β-, and ϵ-subunits and use thermodynamic mutant cycle analyses to assess interactions between αAsp-138 and the invariant cationic residue αArg-209. We directly sequenced muscle AChR α-, β-, δ-, and ϵ-subunit genes using the patient's genomic DNA. Using allele-specific PCR, we determined whether the patient's mutation was present in family members and 400 normal alleles of 200 unrelated controls. Sources of human α-, β-, δ-, and ϵ-subunit cDNAs and subcloning of the cDNAs into the CMV-based mammalian expression vector pRBG4 were as previously described (10Ohno K. Wang H.L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

The mutations were engineered into wild-type AChR subunit cDNAs in pRBG4 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). The presence of each mutation and absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire inserts. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding α-, β-, δ-, and ϵ-subunits and pEGFP-N1 at a ratio of 2:1:1:1:1, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) (11Shen X.M. Ohno K. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

The total number of [125I]α-bungarotoxin ([125I]α-bgt) sites on the surface of transfected HEK cells was determined as described previously (10Ohno K. Wang H.L. Milone M. Bren N. Brengman J.M. Nakano S. Quiram P. Pruitt J.N. Sine S.M. Engel A.G.

Briefly, intact cells were harvested 3 days after transfection by gentle agitation in PBS with 5 mm EDTA. Cells were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in high potassium Ringer's solution, and divided into aliquots for measurements of α-bgt binding. The total number of α-bgt binding sites was determined by incubation for 1 h in the presence of 5 nm [125I]α-bgt. Unbound toxin was removed by washing with potassium Ringer's solution containing 300 μm d-tubocurarine, followed by filtration using a cell harvester (Brandel Inc.). Radioactivity retained by the glass fiber filters (Whatman GF-B, 1 μm cut-off) was measured with a γ counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 300 μm d-tubocurarine. Binding properties of αδ dimers were determined in cells made permeable with saponin by modification of an established method (12Blount P. Merlie J.P. Molecular basis of the two nonequivalent ligand binding sites of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After removing the growth medium, cells were incubated for 5 min in PBS/EDTA plus 0.1% BSA and 0.5% saponin prior to incubation with [125I]α-bgt. Recordings were obtained in the cell-attached patch configuration at a membrane potential of −80 mV at 22 °C and with bath and pipette solutions containing 142 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) at a bandwidth of 50 kHz, digitized at 5-μs intervals using a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments), and recorded to a hard disk using the program Clampex version 8.2 (Axon Instruments). Recordings obtained with ACh concentrations of 1 μm or less were analyzed at a uniform bandwidth of 11.7 kHz with an imposed dead time of 15.3 μs. Recordings obtained with ACh concentrations of 10 μm or more were analyzed at a bandwidth of 10 kHz and an imposed dead time of 25 μs using TAC version 4.0.9 software (Bruxton). Dwell time histograms were plotted on a logarithmic abscissa and fitted with the sum of exponentials by maximum likelihood (13Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Data transformations for improved display and fitting of single-channel dwell time histograms.Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). To estimate rate constants underlying AChR activation, we employed desensitizing concentrations of ACh that cause events from a single receptor channel to cluster into sequences of identifiable activation episodes (14Sakmann B. Patlak J. Neher E. Single acetylcholine-activated channels show burst-kinetics in presence of desensitizing concentrations of agonist.Nature. 1980; 286: 71-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Clusters were identified as a series of closely spaced openings preceded and followed by closed intervals greater than a defined critical time. The critical time was determined by a method that misclassifies an equal number of events between two adjacent closed-time components (15Colquhoun D. Sakmann B. Fast events in single-channel currents activated by acetylcholine and its analogues at the frog muscle end-plate.J. Physiol. 1985; 369: 501-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). For each receptor, the critical time that provided the best fit for the closed-time histogram was chosen for the final analysis. Clusters with fewer than five openings were excluded from analysis. Individual clusters were examined for homogeneity based on the mean Po and open duration for each cluster, and clusters within 2 S.D. values of the mean were accepted for further analysis (16Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Maximum likelihood estimation of aggregated Markov processes.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1997; 264: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Shen X.M. Ohno K. Tsujino A.

Invest. 2003; 111: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The resulting global set of open and closed dwell times from wild-type and mutant AChRs was analyzed using the program MIL (QuB suite), which uses an interval-based maximum likelihood method that also corrects for missed events (16Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Maximum likelihood estimation of aggregated Markov processes.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1997; 264: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) to yield fitted rate constants in a kinetic scheme for receptor activation. For each wild-type or mutant AChR, single channel dwell times obtained over a range of ACh concentrations (10–1,000 μm) were fitted simultaneously. The final set of rate constants was checked by comparing probability density functions calculated from the rate constants and the experimental dwell time histograms and by the ability of the rate constants to predict the mean burst duration at limiting low concentrations of ACh (18Colquhoun D. Hawkes A.G. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum, New York1995: 397-482Crossref Google Scholar, 19Colquhoun D. Hawkes A.G. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording.

Miniature endplate current rise times less than 100 microseconds from improved dual recordings can be modeled with passive acetylcholine diffusion from a synaptic vesicle.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The geometry of the synaptic cleft was defined as an open box with AChRs distributed on a 5 × 5-μm area that was 0.05 μm from the presynaptic membrane. For the wild-type AChR, the AChR density was set to 10,000/μm2 on the crests and 2,970/μm2 on deeper regions of the folds. For the mutant AChR from the patient, the density was reduced in proportion to the cell surface expression determined by the [125I]α-bgt binding measurements. A quantum of 1,000 ACh molecules, the maximum allowable, was released at time 0, and each molecule was followed with a time resolution of 0.5 μs. The diffusion constant of ACh in the cleft was 2.1 × 10−6 cm2/s. The association and dissociation rates for the formation of the complex between ACh and AChE were 2 × 108 m−1 s−1 and 1.4 × 104 s−1, respectively. The rate constants for the wild-type and mutant AChRs derived from kinetic analysis of open and closed dwell times were applied to the model. The amplitude of the simulated MEPC for the wild-type AChR was normalized to the mean amplitude of the MEPCs from control human EPs (22Shen X.M. Ohno K. Fukudome T. Tsujino A. Brengman J.M. De Vivo D.C. Packer R.J. Engel A.G. Congenital myasthenic syndrome caused by low-expressor fast-channel AChR δ subunit mutation.Neurology. 2002; 59: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We performed mutant cycle analysis to determine whether the functional contributions of two residues, X and Y, are independent or interdependent. The functional consequences of mutating residue X, with and without the mutation of residue Y, are computed from the free energy change associated with a given reaction step for the wild-type AChR and the mutants AChRX, AChRY, and AChRXY. In the case of the AChR, the relevant reaction step was the apparent channel gating equilibrium constant of the diliganded receptor, θ, which has an associated free energy change (ΔG) = −RTlnθ. Although θ is a composite of closed-state priming and channel gating steps (23Mukhtasimova N. Lee W.Y. Wang H.L. Sine S.M. Detection and trapping of intermediate states priming nicotinic receptor channel opening.Nature. 2009; 459: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and thus is an apparent equilibrium constant, it remains a highly sensitive measure of interresidue coupling. The changes in gating free energy due to the mutations X, Y, and XY relative to the wild-type are designated ΔΔGX, ΔΔGY, and ΔΔGXY. These terms are related to the free energy of interresidue interaction, ΔΔGint, as follows: ΔΔGXY = ΔΔGX + ΔΔGY + ΔΔGint (24Horovitz A. Fersht A.R. Strategy for analysing the co-operativity of intramolecular interactions in peptides and proteins.J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 25Wells J.A. Additivity of mutational effects in proteins.Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Given this relationship and noting that ΔΔGs for the individual mutant AChR is ΔGX − ΔGW, ΔGY − ΔGW, ΔGXY − ΔGW, ΔΔGint can be calculated from −RTln((θW × θXY)/(θX × θY)), where θ is the apparent channel gating equilibrium constant for wild-type (W) and mutant (X, Y, and XY) AChRs (4Lee W.Y. Sine S.M. Principal pathway coupling agonist binding to channel gating in nicotinic receptors.Nature. 2005; 438: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 26Shen X.M. Fukuda T. Ohno K.

Invest. 2008; 118: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Error estimates of the scheme rate constants for wild-type and mutant receptors in TABLE 1, TABLE 2 were computed by the MIL program from the curvature of the likelihood function at its maximum (16Qin F. Auerbach A. Sachs F. Maximum likelihood estimation of aggregated Markov processes.Proc. Biol. Sci. 1997; 264: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To compute the S.E. for ΔΔG, the likelihood surfaces for each fitted β or α are assumed to be symmetrical about the maximum. The S.E. of ΔΔG is then computed from the S.E. for each rate constant (i.e. S.E. βN) as follows (5Mukhtasimova N. Sine S.M.

Open table in a new tab All human studies were in accordance with the guidelines of and were approved by the institutional review board of the Mayo Clinic. The parents of the patient reported in this study provided informed consent to participate. An 11-year-old girl was hypotonic and apneic at birth. During infancy and early childhood, she had severe weakness of all muscles. Because she could not swallow, she was fed through a gastrostomy tube, and she had recurrent apneic episodes requiring ventilatory support. At 1 year of age, electromyographic studies revealed a defect in neuromuscular transmission. She improved with high doses of the cholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine, which prolongs the lifetime of ACh in the synaptic cleft, and improved further with 3,4-diaminopyridine, which enhances the number of acetylcholine quanta released by nerve impulse. At age 11, she has no further apneic episodes, is able to walk with support, can speak a few words with a palatal support, and attends a school for children with special needs. There are no similarly affected family members. To determine the molecular basis of the patient's illness, we sequenced each AChR subunit gene. This revealed two mutations in the δ-subunit of the receptor (CHRND): a paternally inherited c.481G→A/p.δD140N mutation located in the signature Cys-loop (Fig. 2) and a maternally inherited splice site mutation within intron 7, c.821–2A→C. Because the parents are asymptomatic, each mutation in the AChR δ subunit is recessive. Neither mutation was detected in 400 normal control alleles. Neither variant is listed in the Exome Variant Database (Exome Variant Server, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA), and δD140N is predicted to be disease-causing by both Mutation Taster and Polyphen-2. The splice site mutation disrupts splicing of exon 8 in one δ-subunit allele, so the second allele harboring the δD140N mutation determines the phenotype. Nucleotide numbers start from the translational start site, with +1 corresponding to the A of the ATG translation initiation codon (NM_000751.2). Codon numbers start from the first codon of the mature peptide (NP_000742.1). The mutated δAsp-140 is conserved at equivalent positions of all subunits of the Cys-loop superfamily of receptors of all species. To date, mutations of equivalent residues in non-δ-subunits of AChR have not been reported. To assess the pathogenic effects of the δD140N mutation, we engineered the mutation into the wild-type human δ-subunit and co-transfected cDNAs encoding mutant or wild-type δ-subunits with complementary wild-type α-, β-, and ϵ-subunits into HEK cells. Expression of the mutant AChR on the surface of intact cells, measured from the binding of [125I]α-bgt, was reduced to 20% of wild-type (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, substitution of Glu for δAsp-140, which maintains the negative charge, reduced expression to ∼40% of wild type, and substitution of positively charged, aromatic, or hydrophobic residues reduced expression to 10% or less (Fig. 3A). Substituting Asn for the equivalent Asp in the different AChR subunits decreased cell surface expression in the following subunit-dependent manner: wild type = ϵm > βm > αm > δm, where the subscript specifies the mutant subunit (Fig. 3B). Note that the α-subunit mutation introduces two mutations per AChR but has a smaller effect than the single mutation in the δ-subunit. Thus, the contribution of the invariant Cys-loop Asp residue to cell surface expression depends on the electrostatic charge and size of the side chain and also on the subunit harboring the Asp residue. To gain insight into why the δD140N mutant reduces AChR surface expression, we determined the ability of the mutant subunit to form a stable complex with the wild-type α-subunit. Compared with cells expressing wild-type α- and δ-subunits, which form intracellular α-δ dimers, cells expressing wild-type α- and mutant δ-subunits exhibited a 60% decrease in [125I]α-bgt binding (Fig. 3C). Thus, the δD140N mutation impairs dimerization of the α- and δ-subunits, which is an early step in AChR assembly (27Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S. Yu X.M. Hall Z.W. Assembly of the mammalian muscle acetylcholine receptor in transfected COS cells.J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the effect of the δD140N mutation on AChR function, we recorded single channel currents in the presence of a limiting low concentration of ACh (50 nm). At a low concentration of ACh, channel openings appear as bursts of several openings in quick succession, with each burst arising from a different channel. The mean burst duration equals the time constant for decay of the synaptic current (18Colquhoun D. Hawkes A.G. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum, New York1995: 397-482Crossref Google Scholar, 28Mathie A. Cull-Candy S.G. Colquhoun D. Single-channel and whole-cell currents evoked by acetylcholine in dissociated sympathetic neurons of the rat.Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1987; 232: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and thus provides insight into the consequences for neuromuscular transmission. Compared with bursts recorded from the wild-type AChR, bursts from the mutant receptor are noticeably briefer (Fig. 4). Histograms of burst durations reveal several exponential components, the longest of which has a mean duration of 3.3 ms for the wild-type AChR and 1.8 ms for the mutant (Table 1). The decrease in mean burst duration predicts a more rapid decay of the synaptic response at mutant compared with normal endplates, reducing the safety margin of neuromuscular transmission. To investigate the subunit dependence of the invariant Cys-loop Asp on mean burst duration, we made analogous recordings from mutant AChRs in the presence of low concentrations of ACh. The mean burst duration decreased in the following subunit-dependent manner: wild-type > δm > ϵm > βm > αm (Table 1 and Fig. 4). Notably, the mutation in the α-subunit reduced the mean burst duration by 15-fold compared with that of the wild-type AChR. Thus, as observed for cell surface expression, the Asp-to-Asn substitution affects the mean burst duration in a subunit-dependent manner. To gain further insight into the functional consequences of the δD140N mutation, we recorded single channel currents over a range of increased ACh concentrations. Under these conditions, individual AChR channels activate in clusters of many channel openings in quick succession, which terminate by desensitization. The durations of openings and closings within clusters give information on the kinetics of state transitions within a mechanism of receptor activation, including rate constants for agonist association and dissociation and channel opening and closing. The rate constants are estimated by fitting a kinetic scheme to the sequences of intracluster open and closed dwell times. For both the wild-type and mutant AChR, closed dwell times within clusters become progressively briefer as the ACh concentration increases, and the closed duration histograms mirror the concentration-dependent change from long to brief intracluster closings (Fig. 5). Notably, the change from long to brief intracluster closings occurs at a higher concentration of ACh for the mutant compared with the wild-type AChR. In addition, at intermediate ACh concentrations, the ratio of brief to long closings is greater for the wild-type than for the mutant AChR. These qualitative changes in intracluster closings suggest that the mutation affects one or more kinetic transitions that precede the channel-opening step. To identify rate constants altered by the mutation, we fitted the following minimal kinetic scheme to sequences of open and closed dwell times obtained over a range of increased ACh concentrations.

The doubly occupied receptor opens with rate constant β and closes with rate constant α, and ACh blocks the open channel with rate constant k+b, and it dissociates from the block state with rate constant k−b.

https://openalex.org/W2196566130,"By introducing synonymous mutations into the coding sequences of GP64sp and FibHsp signal peptides, the influences of mRNA secondary structure and codon usage of signal sequences on protein expression and secretion were investigated using baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The results showed that mRNA structural stability of the signal sequences was not correlated with the protein production and secretion levels, and FibHsp was more tolerable to codon changes than GP64sp. Codon bias analyses revealed that codons for GP64sp were well de-optimized and contained more non-optimal codons than FibHsp. Synonymous mutations in GP64sp sufficiently increased its average codon usage frequency and resulted in dramatic reduction of the activity and secretion of luciferase. Protein degradation inhibition assay with MG-132 showed that higher codon usage frequency in the signal sequence increased the production as well as the degradation of luciferase protein, indicating that the synonymous codon substitutions in the signal sequence caused misfolding of luciferase instead of slowing down the protein production. Meanwhile, we found that introduction of more non-optimal codons into FibHsp could increase the production and secretion levels of luciferase, which suggested a new strategy to improve the production of secretory proteins in insect cells."

In initial structure activity relationships study, the 1-methylbenzimidazole ring was replaced by the isosteric heterocycles benzimidazole, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole and the position of the hydroxamic acid substituent on the phenyl ring was varied. Whereas compounds bearing a para substituted hydroxamic acid (9a-d) were active HDAC inhibitors, the meta substituted analogues (8a-d) were appreciably inactive. Compounds 9a-d selectively inhibited HDAC6 (IC50 = 0.1-1.0 μM) over HDAC1 (IC50 = 0.9-6 μM) and moreover, also selectively inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells vs. patient matched normal cells. The compounds induce a cell cycle arrest in the S-phase while induction of apoptosis is neglible as compared to controls. Molecular modeling studies uncovered that the MM-GBSA energy for interaction of 9a-d with HDAC6 was higher than for HDAC1 providing structural rationale for the HDAC6 selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2201042290,"Background Meta-analyses are considered the gold standard of evidence-based health care, and are used to guide clinical decisions and health policy. A major limitation of current meta-analysis techniques is their inability to pool ordinal data. Our objectives were to determine the extent of this problem in the context of neurological rating scales and to provide a solution. Methods Using an existing database of clinical trials of oral neuroprotective therapies, we identified the 6 most commonly used clinical rating scales and recorded how data from these scales were reported and analysed. We then identified systematic reviews of studies that used these scales (via the Cochrane database) and recorded the meta-analytic techniques used. Finally, we identified a statistical technique for calculating a common language effect size measure for ordinal data. Results We identified 103 studies, with 128 instances of the 6 clinical scales being reported. The majority– 80%–reported means alone for central tendency, with only 13% reporting medians. In analysis, 40% of studies used parametric statistics alone, 34% of studies employed non-parametric analysis, and 26% did not include or specify analysis. Of the 60 systematic reviews identified that included meta-analysis, 88% used mean difference and 22% employed difference in proportions; none included rank-based analysis. We propose the use of a rank-based generalised odds ratio (WMW GenOR) as an assumption-free effect size measure that is easy to compute and can be readily combined in meta-analysis. Conclusion There is wide scope for improvement in the reporting and analysis of ordinal data in the literature. We hope that adoption of the WMW GenOR will have the dual effect of improving the reporting of data in individual studies while also increasing the inclusivity (and therefore validity) of meta-analyses."

In the present study, we assessed the potential risk posed by transgenic cry1Ca rice (T1C-19) on the development of a frog species by adding purified Cry1Ca protein or T1C-19 rice straw into the rearing water of Xenopus laevis tadpoles, and by feeding X. laevis froglets diets containing rice grains of T1C-19 or its non-transformed counterpart MH63. Our results showed that there were no significant differences among groups receiving 100 μg L–1 or 10 μg L–1 Cry1Ca and the blank control in terms of time to completed metamorphosis, survival rate, body weight, body length, organ weight and liver enzyme activity after being exposed to the Cry1Ca (P > 0.05). Although some detection indices in the rice straw groups were significantly different from those of the blank control group (P < 0.05), there was no significant difference between the T1C-19 and MH63 rice straw groups. Moreover, there were no significant differences in the mortality rate, body weight, daily weight gain, liver and fat body weight of the froglets between the T1C-19 and MH63 dietary groups after 90 days, and there were no abnormal pathological changes in the stomach, intestines, livers, spleens and gonads. Thus, we conclude that the planting of transgenic cry1Ca rice will not adversely affect frog development."
https://openalex.org/W2221469681,"Freezing—cryosurgery, and electrolysis—electrochemical therapy (EChT), are two important minimally invasive surgery tissue ablation technologies. Despite major advantages they also have some disadvantages. Cryosurgery cannot induce cell death at high subzero freezing temperatures and requires multiple freeze thaw cycles, while EChT requires high concentrations of electrolytic products—which makes it a lengthy procedure. Based on the observation that freezing increases the concentration of solutes (including products of electrolysis) in the frozen region and permeabilizes the cell membrane to these products, this study examines the hypothesis that there could be a synergistic effect between freezing and electrolysis in their use together for tissue ablation. Using an animal model we refer to as vivens ex vivo, which may be of value in reducing the use of animals for experiments, combined with a Hematoxylin stain of the nucleus, we show that there are clinically relevant protocols in which the cell nucleus appears intact when electrolysis and freezing are used separately but is affected by certain combinations of electrolysis and freezing."

The former (54% of the cases) arose either in the abdominal cavity, or as intrathecal/intraspinal lesions and is composed of cytokeratin-negative spindle cells with fascicular/storiform growth pattern consistent with zebrafish MPNSTs. The second histotype was composed by polygonal or elongated cells, immunohistochemically positive for the pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3. The overall histologic and immunohistochemical features were consistent with a malignant epithelial neoplasm of possible gastrointestinal/pancreatic origin. With an integrated approach, based on microsatellite (VNTR) and STS markers, we showed that ia2 insertion, in Tg(-8.5nkx2.2a:GFP)ia2 embryos, is associated with a deletion of 15.2 Mb in the telomeric portion of chromosome 1. Interestingly, among ia2 deleted genes we identified the presence of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 gene that may be one of the possible drivers for the MPNSTs in ia2 mutants. Thanks to the peculiar features of zebrafish as animal model of human cancer (cellular and genomic similarity, transparency and prolificacy) and the GFP tag, the Tg(-8.5nkx2.2a:GFP)ia2 line provides a manageable tool to study in vivo with high frequency MPNST biology and genetics, and to identify, in concert with the existing zebrafish MPNST models, conserved relevant mechanisms in zebrafish and human cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2202792305,"Background Some observational studies have suggested that higher prenatal Vitamin D intake may be associated with improved health outcomes in childhood. However there have been mixed results in this area with some negative studies, especially for effects on atopic and respiratory outcomes. We examined the effect of prenatal Vitamin D on healthcare utilisation in the first three years of life. Methods In an ethnically stratified randomised controlled trial conducted at St Mary’s Hospital London, 180 women at 27 weeks gestation were allocated to no Vitamin D, 800 IU ergocalciferol daily until delivery, or a single oral bolus of 200,000 IU cholecalciferol. Participants were randomised in blocks of 15 using computer-generated numbers and investigators were blinded to group assignment. Supplementation increased maternal and cord blood 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations, but levels remained lower than current recommendations. Primary health economic outcome was overall cost of unscheduled healthcare utilisation in the first three years of life as documented in the child’s electronic health record. Secondary outcomes included cost attributable to: primary and secondary healthcare visits, respiratory and atopic complaints, cost in years 1, 2 and 3 of life and cost and frequency of prescribed medication. All costs were calculated as pounds sterling. Differences between groups were analysed using unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, and analysis of variance for adjusted analyses. Results We assessed 99/180 (55%) complete electronic health records, control (n = 31), daily (n = 36) and bolus (n = 32). We found no difference in total healthcare utilisation costs between the control and daily (mean difference in costs in pounds sterling 1.02, 95%CI -1.60, 1.65; adjusted 1.07, 95%CI -1.62, 1.86) or control and bolus groups (mean difference -1.58, 95%CI -2.63, 1.06; adjusted –1.40, 95%CI -2.45, 1.24). There were no adverse effects of supplementation reported during the trial. Conclusions We found no evidence that prenatal vitamin D supplementation from 27 weeks gestation to delivery, at doses which failed to completely correct maternal vitamin D deficiency, influence overall healthcare utilisation in children in the first 3 years.

https://openalex.org/W2204275611,"The factors responsible for the formation of Amazonian primate communities are not well understood. Here we investigated the influence of interspecific competition in the assembly of these communities, specifically whether they follow an assembly rule known as ""favored states"". According to this rule, interspecific competition influences final species composition, resulting in functional groups that are equally represented in the community. We compiled presence-absence data for primate species at 39 Amazonian sites in Brazil, contrasting two regions with distinct productivity regimes: the eutrophic Juruá River basin and the oligotrophic Negro River basin. We tested two hypotheses: that interspecific competition is a mechanism that influences the structure of Amazonian primate communities, and that competition has had a greater influence on the structure of primate communities in regions with low productivity, where resources are more limited. We used null models to test the statistical significance of the results, and found a non-random pattern compatible with the favored states rule in the two regions. Our findings suggest that interspecific competition is an important force driving primate community assembly regardless of productivity regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2214680592,"Aim This study proposes the replacement of all the physical devices used in the manufacturing of conventional prostheses through the use of digital tools, such as 3D scanners, CAD design software, 3D implants files, rapid prototyping machines or reverse engineering software, in order to develop laboratory work models from which to finish coatings for dental prostheses. Different types of dental prosthetic structures are used, which were adjusted by a non-rotatory threaded fixing system. Method From a digital process, the relative positions of dental implants, soft tissue and adjacent teeth of edentulous or partially edentulous patients has been captured, and a maser working model which accurately replicates data relating to the patients oral cavity has been through treatment of three-dimensional digital data. Results Compared with the conventional master cast, the results show a significant cost savings in attachments, as well as an increase in the quality of reproduction and accuracy of the master cast, with the consequent reduction in the number of patient consultation visits. The combination of software and hardware three-dimensional tools allows the optimization of the planning of dental implant-supported rehabilitations protocol, improving the predictability of clinical treatments and the production cost savings of master casts for restorations upon implants."
https://openalex.org/W2204070878,"Objectives We investigated whether long-term clinical outcomes such as disease progression or inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier state can be predicted by baseline factors in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative HBV infected patients with an elevated viral load. Methods A retrospective cohort of 527 HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infected patients with an elevated viral load (HBV DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/ml) was assessed for disease progression defined by the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cirrhotic complication, as well as becoming an inactive carrier. Results During a median 3.6 years of follow-up, disease progression was detected in 46 patients (40 with HCC, 6 with cirrhotic complication), and 31 of 309 non-cirrhotic patients became inactive carriers. Older age, male gender, cirrhosis, high HBV DNA levels at baseline, and short antiviral therapy duration were independent risk factors for HCC. Low HBV DNA and quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen (qHBsAg) levels were independent predictors for becoming inactive carriers in patients without cirrhosis. In non-cirrhotic patients with both low qHBsAg and HBV DNA levels, the 5-year cumulative incidence of an inactive carrier was 39.8%, while that of disease progression was 1.6%. Conclusion HBeAg negative patients without cirrhosis can be closely monitored for becoming an inactive carrier when both HBV DNA and qHBsAg levels are low, as the risk of disease progression is low while incidence of an inactive carrier is high."
https://openalex.org/W2214792915,"Periodontitis is a chronic, bacterially-induced inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting tissues, which may result in transient bacteremia and a systemic inflammatory response. Periodontitis is associated with coronary artery disease independently of established cardiovascular risk factors, and translocation of bacteria from the oral cavity to the coronary arteries may play a role in the development of coronary artery disease. Very few studies have used angioplasty balloons for in vivo sampling from diseased coronary arteries, and with varying results. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess if bacterial DNA from primarily oral bacteria could be detected on coronary angioplasty balloons by use of an optimized sampling process combined with an internally validated sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Coronary angioplasty balloons and control samples from a total of 45 unselected patients with stable angina, unstable angina/non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (n = 15 in each group) were collected and analyzed using a PCR assay with high sensitivity and specificity for 16S rRNA genes of the oral microbiome. Despite elimination of extraction and purification steps, and demonstration of sensitivity levels of 25–125 colony forming units (CFU), we did not detect bacterial DNA from any of the coronary angioplasty balloons. A subsequent questionnaire indicated that the prevalence of periodontitis in the study cohort was at least 39.5%. Although coronary angioplasty balloons are unlikely to be useful for detection of bacteria with current PCR techniques in unselected patients with coronary artery disease, more studies are warranted to determine the extent to which bacteria contribute to atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations and whether the presence of bacteria in the arteries is a transient phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2297630607,"Current crop insurance is designed to mitigate monetary fluctuations resulting from yield losses for a specific year. However, yield realization tendency can vary from year to year and may depend on the correlation of yield realizations across years. When the current single-year Yield Protection (YP) and Area Risk Protection Insurance (ARPI) contracts are extended to multiple periods, actuarially fair premium rate is expected to decrease as poor yield realizations in a year can be offset by another year’s better yield realizations. In this study, we first use simulations to demonstrate how significant premium savings are possible when coverage is based on the sum of yields across years rather than on a year-by-year basis. We then describe the design of a multi-year framework of crop insurance and model the insurance using a copula approach. Insurance terms are extended to more than a year and the premium, liability, and indemnity are determined by a multi-year term. Moreover, partial payment is provided at the end of each term to offset the possibility of significant loss in a single term. County-level data obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture are used to demonstrate the implementations of the proposed multi-year crop insurance. The proposed multi-year plan would benefit farmers by offering insurance guarantees across years for significantly lower costs."
https://openalex.org/W2212904430,"Network robustness is the ability of a network to maintain performance after disruption, thus it is an important index for network designers to refer to. Every actual network has its own topology structure, flow magnitude (scale) and flow distribution. How the robustness relates to these factors still remains unresolved. To analyze the relations, we first established a robustness problem model, studied the hardness of a special case of the model, and generated a lot of representative network instances. We conducted experiments on these instances, deleting 5% to 50% edges on each instance and found that the robustness of a network has an approximate linearity to its structural entropy and flow entropy, when the correlation coefficient between the structure and flow is fixed. We also found that robustness is unlikely to have a relation to the flow scale and edge scale in our model. The empirical studies thus can provide a way of quickly estimating the robustness of real-world networks by using the regression coefficients we obtained during the experiments. We conducted computation on a real-world dataset and got favorable results, which exhibited the effectiveness of the estimation."
https://openalex.org/W2411593578,"MIS416 is an intact minimal cell wall skeleton derived from Proprionibacterium acnes that is phagocytosed by antigen presenting cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). This property allows MIS416 to be exploited as a vehicle for the delivery of peptide antigens or other molecules (for example, nucleic acids) to DCs. We previously showed that covalent (non-cleavable) conjugation of OVA, a model antigen derived from ovalbumin, to MIS416 enhanced immune responses in DCs in vivo, compared to unconjugated MIS416 and OVA. Intracellular trafficking promotes the lysosomal degradation of MIS416, leading to the destruction of MIS416 plus the associated cargos conjugated to MIS416. However, lysosomal degradation of cargo may not be desired for some MIS416 conjugates. Here we have investigated whether a cleavable linkage could facilitate release of the cargo in the cytoplasm of DCs to avoid lysosomal degradation. DCs were treated in vitro with disulfide-containing conjugates, and as hypothesised faster release of SIINFEKL peptide in the cytoplasm of DCs was observed with the inclusion of a disulfide bond between MIS416 and cargo. The inclusion of a cleavable disulfide bond in the conjugates did not significantly alter the amount of SIINFEKL antigens presented on MHC I molecules on DCs as compared with conjugates without a disulfide bond. However, the conjugates containing disulfide-linkages performed either slightly better (p<0.05) than, or the same as conjugates without a disulfide bond with respect to in vitro OT-1 T-cell proliferation induced by the presentation of SIINFEKL antigens on DCs, or DC activation studies, respectively. However, disulfide-containing conjugates were less effective than conjugates without a disulfide bond in in vivo cytotoxicity assays. In conclusion, inclusion of a disulfide bond in MIS416-peptide conjugates was associated with efficient release of peptides in the cytoplasm of DCs, an important consideration for MIS416-mediated delivery of degradation-sensitive cargoes. However, treatment of DCs with disulfide-containing conjugates did not significantly alter the presentation of peptide antigens on MHC class I molecules to T-cells, or greatly enhance antigen-associated T-cell proliferation in vitro."
