Here the neural basis for g is investigated by means of positron emission tomography. Spatial, verbal, and perceptuo-motor tasks with high- g involvement are compared with matched low- g control tasks. In contrast to the common view that g reflects a broad sample of major cognitive functions, high- g tasks do not show diffuse recruitment of multiple brain regions. Instead they are associated with selective recruitment of lateral frontal cortex in one or both hemispheres. Despite very different task content in the three high- g –low- g contrasts, lateral frontal recruitment is markedly similar in each case. Many previous experiments have shown these same frontal regions to be recruited by a broad range of different cognitive demands. The results suggest that “general intelligence” derives from a specific frontal system important in the control of diverse forms of behavior."

A statistical analysis of the occurrences of 162 genera and 333 species confirms a sudden extinction event at 251.4 million years ago, coincident with a dramatic depletion of delta13C(carbonate) and an increase in microspherules."
https://openalex.org/W1968643089,"The guanosine triphosphatase Rab1 regulates the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus through interaction with effector molecules, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here, the tethering factor p115 was shown to be a Rab1 effector that binds directly to activated Rab1. Rab1 recruited p115 to coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles during budding from the endoplasmic reticulum, where it interacted with a select set of COPII vesicle-associated SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) to form a cis-SNARE complex that promotes targeting to the Golgi apparatus. We propose that Rab1-regulated assembly of functional effector-SNARE complexes defines a conserved molecular mechanism to coordinate recognition between subcellular compartments."

This process requires the activities of the SHATTERPROOF MADS-box genes, which promote dehiscence zone differentiation at the valve/replum boundary. Here we show that the FRUITFULL MADS-box gene, which is necessary for fruit valve differentiation, is a negative regulator of SHATTERPROOF expression and that constitutive expression of FRUITFULL is sufficient to prevent formation of the dehiscence zone. Our studies suggest that ectopic expression of FRUITFULL may directly allow the control of pod shatter in oilseed crops such as canola."

Above 2000 meters elevation, the ice sheet is in balance on average but has some regions of local thickening or thinning. Thinning predominates at lower elevations, with rates exceeding 1 meter per year close to the coast. Interpolation of our results between flight lines indicates a net loss of about 51 cubic kilometers of ice per year from the entire ice sheet, sufficient to raise sea level by 0.13 millimeter per year-approximately 7% of the observed rise."
https://openalex.org/W2171076894,"The atomic force microscope images surfaces by sensing the forces between a sharp tip and a sample. If the tip-sample interaction is dominated by short-range forces due to the formation of covalent bonds, the image of an individual atom should reflect the angular symmetry of the interaction. Here, we report on a distinct substructure in the images of individual adatoms on silicon (111)-(7x7), two crescents with a spherical envelope. The crescents are interpreted as images of two atomic orbitals of the front atom of the tip. Key for the observation of these subatomic features is a force-detection scheme with superior noise performance and enhanced sensitivity to short-range forces."
https://openalex.org/W2049446075,"We describe a single RNA sequence that can assume either of two ribozyme folds and catalyze the two respective reactions. The two ribozyme folds share no evolutionary history and are completely different, with no base pairs (and probably no hydrogen bonds) in common. Minor variants of this sequence are highly active for one or the other reaction, and can be accessed from prototype ribozymes through a series of neutral mutations. Thus, in the course of evolution, new RNA folds could arise from preexisting folds, without the need to carry inactive intermediate sequences. This raises the possibility that biological RNAs having no structural or functional similarity might share a common ancestry. Furthermore, functional and structural divergence might, in some cases, precede rather than follow gene duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2084093310,"It is becoming clear that receptors that initiate signal transduction by interacting with G-proteins do not function as monomers, but often require accessory proteins for function. Some of these accessory proteins are chaperones, required for correct transport of the receptor to the cell surface, but the function of many accessory proteins remains unknown. We determined the role of an accessory protein for the receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator neuropeptide. We have previously shown that this accessory protein, the CGRP-receptor component protein (RCP), is expressed in CGRP responsive tissues and that RCP protein expression correlates with the biological efficacy of CGRP in vivo. However, the function of RCP has remained elusive. In this study stable cell lines were made that express antisense RCP RNA, and CGRP- and adrenomedullin-mediated signal transduction were greatly reduced. However, the loss of RCP did not effect CGRP binding or receptor density, indicating that RCP did not behave as a chaperone but was instead coupling the CGRP receptor to downstream effectors. A candidate CGRP receptor named calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) has been identified, and in this study RCP co-immunoprecipitated with CRLR indicating that these two proteins interact directly. Since CGRP and adrenomedullin can both signal through CRLR, which has been previously shown to require a chaperone protein for function, we now propose that a functional CGRP or adrenomedullin receptor consists of at least three proteins: the receptor (CRLR), the chaperone protein (RAMP), and RCP that couples the receptor to the cellular signal transduction pathway.

However, it has recently been recognized that many G protein-coupled receptors require additional proteins for function. These proteins range from other receptors that form dimers, to heterologous accessory proteins that function primarily as chaperones (1Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G.

In this study we report a novel accessory protein that does not act as a chaperone, but instead couples the receptor to the cellular signal transduction pathway. Thus, our concept of a G protein-coupled receptor involves a complex of proteins that are required for receptor function, including correct intracellular sorting, organization in the plasma membrane, and coupling to cellular signal transduction proteins. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)1 is a potent vasoactive neuropeptide, which has been implicated in vasodilation, migraine, and chronic pain (3Menard D.P. van Rossum D. Kar S. St Pierre S.

Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Despite the clinical implications of CGRP's biological actions, therapeutic strategies targeting CGRP have been hindered by the lack of a functional CGRP receptor. CGRP binding results in increased intracellular cAMP levels (7Poyner D.R. Andrew D.P. Brown D. Bose C. Hanley M.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 105: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Van Valen F. Piechot G. Jurgens H. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 119: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and a candidate G protein-coupled receptor has been identified called the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) (9Chang C.P. Pearse R.V.d. O'Connell S. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1187-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, CRLR was initially non-functional when transfected into mammalian tissue culture cells (10Fluhmann B. Muff R. Hunziker W. Fischer J.A. Born W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Han Z.Q. Coppock H.A. Smith D.M. Van Noorden S. Makgoba M.W. Nicholl C.G. Legon S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 18: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An accessory protein named the CGRP-receptor component protein (RCP) was cloned in our laboratory and found to confer CGRP receptor function in Xenopus laevis oocytes (12Luebke A.E. Dahl G.P. Roos B.A. Dickerson I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, co-transfection of CRLR and RCP into tissue culture cells did not yield functional CGRP receptors. A second accessory protein was subsequently cloned, the receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP1), which did yield functional CGRP receptors when co-transfected with CRLR into cell culture (13McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). In these experiments RAMP1 functioned as a chaperone for CRLR, and was required for expression of CRLR on the cell surface. The function and requirement for RCP has been less clear. RCP has no homology to RAMP1 or other sequences in GenBank, and contains no obvious protein motifs that predict its function. RCP is expressed in CGRP-responsive tissues, and RCP expression correlates with the potency of CGRP in vivo (14Naghashpour M. Rosenblatt M.I. Dickerson I.M. Dahl G.P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Naghashpour M. Dahl G. Am. J. Physiol.

Sci. 2000; 41: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar), but the lack of a requirement for RCP in cell culture co-transfection studies has remained puzzling. In these studies we determined the role of RCP in CGRP-mediated signal transduction. We made stable cell lines which express antisense RCP and show that RCP is an intracellular peripheral membrane protein that interacts with the CGRP receptor CRLR and facilitates CGRP and adrenomedullin-mediated signaling. RCP thus represents a new class of proteins that facilitate signal transduction at G protein-coupled receptors. To maximize the hybridization between the antisense message and the endogenous RCP mRNA, the NIH3T3 RCP cDNA was isolated. Primers designed against mouse RCP (14Naghashpour M. Rosenblatt M.I. Dickerson I.M. Dahl G.P. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were used for 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Marathon RACE, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and the full-length RCP cDNA was constructed using methods previously described (17Rosenblatt M.I. Dickerson I.M. Peptides. 1997; 18: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The NIH3T3 RCP was then cloned in the antisense orientation in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) which contains the gene for neomycin phosphoryltransferase, and confers resistance to geneticin (G418). NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.6% penicillin G, 1% streptomycin SO4, and 3% glutamine. NIH3T3 cells were grown to 70% confluency in a 60-mm dish and transfected with 8 μg of pcDNA3 containing the RCP antisense cDNA and 45 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were split into 15 100-mm plates and grown in media supplemented with 1.6 mg/ml G418 (geneticin). The media was changed every 48 h and after 3 weeks distinct colonies were visible. Colonies were screened for loss of RCP protein expression by Western blot analysis. Colonies that did not express RCP protein were further screened for loss of CGRP-induced cAMP response (18Sarkar A. Dickerson I.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were scraped into homogenizing buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA) plus protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 60 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized at high speed in a Brinkmann Polytron for 15 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2 (50/5/5) buffer. Protein concentration was determined using the Micro BCA Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). RCP antibodies (R82 and R83) are rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against a peptide with the sequence TDLKDQRPRESGKMRHSAG. RCP antibody 1401 is a chicken polyclonal antibody raised against the full-length recombinant RCP. Rabbit anti-CRLR (OA-910) and anti-RAMP1 (OA-350) polyclonal antisera were raised against amino acids GYSHDCPTEHLNGK and GRTIRSYRELADC, respectively. Forty μg of membranes were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted with antibodies directed against RCP (R82), CRLR, and RAMP1. Membranes were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 1% milk with 0.04% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The membranes were washed with PBS-T, incubated in SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 5 min, and exposed to film. Assays for cAMP production were carried out as described previously (18Sarkar A. Dickerson I.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were split into 12-well plates and incubated for 18–24 h in complete serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% transferrin, 0.05% insulin) supplemented with 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were then incubated with 1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine for 20 min at 37 °C and treated with varying concentrations of agonist plus isobutylmethylxanthine for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 5% cold trichloroacetic acid and assayed for cAMP production by sequential chromatography through Dowex and Alumina columns (18Sarkar A. Dickerson I.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For cAMP studies involving the A2b adenosine receptor, 30 μm rolipram was substituted for isobutylmethylxanthine, since isobutylmethylxanthine has been reported to inhibit these receptors (19Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 56-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Five hundred μg of membranes were incubated with 80 pm125I-CGRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled CGRP for 2 h at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding cold 50/5/5 buffer plus 2% bovine serum albumin followed by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filters. The filters were counted in a Packard Cobra II γ-counter and the specific binding was defined as the difference between observed binding and nonspecific binding. The data was normalized to the maximum specific binding and fit to a single site model in a least squares, non-linear sigmoidal curve (Prism, GraphPad Software). The receptor density was calculated by converting bound 125I-CGRP (dpm) to μCi (2.2 × 106dpm = 1 μCi), and then to moles using the specific activity of125I-CGRP (2000 Ci/mmol). Each assay was performed in quintuplicate. Guinea pigs were sacrificed by injection with pentobarbital and the cerebellum was immediately placed in PTN50 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors and homogenized at high speed in a Brinkmann Polytron for 15 s. The homogenate was freeze-thawed and the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min to pellet cellular debris. RCP and CRLR were immunoprecipitated from the lysate overnight at 4 °C using antibody 1401 (RCP chicken polyclonal) or OA-910 (CRLR rabbit polyclonal). The immune complexes were captured using immobilized anti-chicken IgY (Promega, Madison, WI) or Protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and the immunoprecipitated material extracted by boiling in SDS Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot analysis using antibody 0A-910 (directed against CRLR). RCP complimentary RNA was transcribed using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), and translated using the Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (Promega, Madison, WI).In vitro translation was carried out with [35S]methionine (1,200 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 60 min at 30 °C, and stopped by incubation with 1 μg of cycloheximide for 5 min on ice. For trypsin digests, samples were digested with 2.4 μg of trypsin for 10 min at 25 °C, and the reactions stopped by addition of protease inhibitors. Samples exposed to detergent were made to 1% Triton X-100 prior to addition of trypsin. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, fixed, incubated with AMPLIFY (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For non-detergent extractions, the membrane fractions (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.1m Na2CO3 for 60 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The cytoplasmic (C), membrane (M), salt-washed supernatant (S), and salt-washed pellet (P) were analyzed by Western blot analysis. For detergent extraction, 2 mg of membranes were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, and Triton X-114 was added to give a final concentration of 1%. Samples were vortexed briefly, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 8800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant were transferred to a new tube and the detergent-insoluble pellet was washed with 200 μl of 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. The detergent-insoluble pellet was centrifuged again and the second supernatant was combined with the first supernatant. This combined supernatant was the aqueous fraction (A). The detergent-insoluble fraction (D) was resuspended in Laemmli buffer by vortexing. We determined the role of RCP in CGRP-mediated signal transduction using mammalian tissue culture cells. Western blot analysis was first performed on NIH3T3 cells and COS-7 cells to determine if RCP, RAMP1, and CRLR expression correlated with CGRP receptor function in cell culture. Surprisingly, RCP was detected in both cell lines, while CRLR and RAMP1 were limited to NIH3T3 cells (Fig.1 A). Functional CGRP receptors were detected by cAMP assays only in NIH3T3 cells, correlating with expression of all three proteins (Fig. 1 B). Our findings of endogenous RCP expression in COS-7 cells explains why RCP was not needed in previous experiments, where co-transfection of CRLR and RAMP1 alone resulted in functional CGRP receptors in COS-7 cells (13McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 20Buhlmann N. Leuthauser K. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We screened several immortalized cell lines by Western blot, and detected RCP expression in all cell lines tested (data not shown). Our survey was not exhaustive and we do not know if this extended expression of RCP in cell lines is significant, but it is in contrast to previousin vivo studies which found RCP expression limited to distinct populations of cells in the cochlea, brain, and eye (12Luebke A.E. Dahl G.P. Roos B.A. Dickerson I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Rosenblatt M.I. Dahl G.P. Dickerson I.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Brain Res. 1999; 66: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Since cell lines were not identified which lacked endogenous RCP expression, gain of function experiments were not feasible. Therefore, to determine the role of RCP in CGRP-mediated signal transduction stable cell lines were constructed that expressed antisense RCP RNA, and the signal transduction and ligand binding in the RCP-depleted cells was determined. NIH3T3 cells contain CGRP receptors (Fig.1 B) and we have determined that these CGRP receptors exhibit Type I CGRP receptor pharmacology (data not shown), consistent with the pharmacological profile of the CGRP receptor CRLR (11Han Z.Q. Coppock H.A. Smith D.M. Van Noorden S. Makgoba M.W. Nicholl C.G. Legon S. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 18: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J.

Li Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11325-11329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Antisense strategies have evolved into an effective method of inhibiting protein expression in cell culture where expression of antisense RNA results in loss of protein expression, either by increased RNA turnover or by blockage of protein translation (23Green P.J. Pines O. Inouye M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 569-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 24Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). RCP cDNA was constructed as described previously (16Rosenblatt M.I. Dahl G.P. Dickerson I.M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar) and a plasmid expressing the RCP cDNA in the antisense orientation was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. Stable cell lines were isolated and screened first for loss of RCP protein expression by Western blot analysis, and then for CGRP-induced cAMP response. RCP protein was not detected by Western blot in the three independent antisense cell lines when 40 μg of membrane protein were loaded per lane (Fig.2 A), and this diminished RCP protein expression correlated with a reduction of CGRP-induced cAMP production to 33% of wild-type (Fig. 2 B). The CGRP-induced cAMP response is not completely abolished, most likely because antisense strategies are not 100% effective, and in fact subsequent overloaded Western blots (225 μg of membrane protein per lane) did reveal low levels of residual RCP expression in the antisense cells (data not shown). RCP might couple the CGRP receptor to downstream effector molecules in the signal transduction pathway, or it might route the receptor to the cell surface, as is the case for RAMP1. To discriminate between these possibilities, competitive CGRP binding experiments were performed on membrane fractions prepared from control NIH3T3 cells and the three RCP-antisense cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the loss of RCP did not alter the IC50 for CGRP (0.42 ± 0.17 nm for control NIH3T3 cells, 0.59 ± 0.21 nm for antisense cells), indicating that loss of RCP did not change the affinity of the receptor for CGRP in the antisense NIH3T3 cells. CGRP receptor density was also not diminished between the control NIH3T3 cells and the antisense cell lines (NIH3T3 = 0.85 ± 0.05 fmol/mg, and antisense cell lines = 1.26 ± 0.095 fmol/mg). The diminution of CGRP-mediated signaling in RCP antisense cells, together with the undiminished CGRP receptor affinity and receptor density, suggests that RCP couples the CGRP receptor to the cellular signal transduction machinery, and is not involved in routing the receptor to the cell surface. Since it has been demonstrated previously that the CGRP receptor CRLR requires the chaperone RAMP1 for function, we propose that a functional CGRP receptor complex requires at least three proteins: the ligand-binding protein (CRLR), a chaperone protein to route CRLR to the cell surface (RAMP1), and a protein to couple the receptor to the cellular signal transduction pathway (RCP) (Fig. 3). In addition to responding to CGRP, CRLR functions as an adrenomedullin receptor in the presence of another chaperone protein RAMP2 (13McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 20Buhlmann N. Leuthauser K. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). If our hypothesis that RCP is a coupling protein between CRLR and the signal transduction pathway is correct, then adrenomedullin-mediated signal transduction should be similarly inhibited in the RCP antisense cells. A reduction of adrenomedullin signaling to 45% of control was in fact observed, as shown in Fig.4 A. To determine if RCP was a generic requirement for signal transduction at all G protein-coupled receptors, the cAMP response for two other receptors endogenous to NIH3T3 cells were tested: β2-adrenergic receptor and A2b adenosine receptor. The loss of RCP had no effect on cAMP production or receptor affinity (EC50) at A2b adenosine (Fig.4 B) or β2-adrenergic receptors (Fig.4 C), suggesting that a limited subset of G protein-coupled receptors requires RCP (to date CRLR). To ascertain whether a complex exists between RCP and CRLR in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using guinea pig cerebellum. Cerebellum is enriched with CGRP-binding sites (25Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 798-804PubMed Google Scholar) and immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization has shown that RCP and CRLR are co-localized in this tissue (21Oliver K.R. Wainwright A.

Sirinathsinghji D.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 57: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (second lane), CRLR co-immunoprecipitated with RCP in the guinea pig cerebellum indicating that a physiological complex exists between RCP and CRLR. The size of CRLR protein was determined by Western blot analysis on membrane fractions prepared from cerebellum (fourth lane). A protein band (molecular mass ≈ 60–70 kDa) was seen which agreed with previously published results (13McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar, 20Buhlmann N. Leuthauser K. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To confirm that CRLR was solubilized under the conditions used in this experiment, CRLR was immunoprecipitated from cerebellum using OA-910 (CRLR rabbit polyclonal antibody) followed by immunoblotting with OA-910. The expected size protein (≈60–70 kDa) was seen in thethird lane along with the cross-reactive rabbit IgG heavy chain (≈50 kDa). The RCP antibody which was raised in chicken was not recognized by the anti-rabbit secondary antibody used to detect OA-910 (first lane). If RCP is coupling the CGRP receptor the signal transduction machinery, it should be an intracellular protein. To further elucidate the mechanism of RCP action, an in vitro protease protection assay was used to determine whether RCP is extracellular or intracellular. Extracellular proteins are usually transported out of the cell by co-translational insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by vesicular transport to the Golgi apparatus, and from there to the cell surface by secretory vesicles. In the protease protection assay, proteins are translated in vitro in the presence of microsomes (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi fractions), and secreted proteins are inserted into the microsomes and therefore protected from digestion by protease (27Yun H.Y. Johnson R.C. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Hence, if RCP is an extracellular protein, it should be protected from protease degradation, and if RCP is intracellular it should be degraded in this assay. Human RCP cDNA (GenBank number AF073792) was transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes. Protein translation was stopped by addition of cycloheximide, trypsin was added, and samples separated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.6 A (top panel), the sensitivity of RCP to digestion from trypsin (second lane) was not diminished by addition of microsomes (fourth lane), indicating that RCP was not incorporated into microsomes and is thus intracellular. In contrast, the yeast α-mating factor (a secreted protein) (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel) was protected from protease digestion (fourth lane), and higher molecular weight glycosylated forms were observed indicating incorporation of yeast α-mating factor protein into microsomes. The low molecular weight form of yeast α-mating factor which was translated independent of the addition of microsomes (first and fourth lanes) was not protected from trypsin digestion, indicating that it had not yet been incorporated into microsomes (lane 4). This protection from trypsin digestion was sensitive to detergent, indicating that a lipid membrane mediated the protection (lane 5). The results from Figs. 1 and 6 suggest that RCP is an intracellular membrane-associated protein. Peripheral membrane proteins attached to the plasma membrane via weak ionic interactions can often be removed by increased salt concentration or increased pH; whereas membrane-spanning proteins or proteins attached to membranes by covalent interactions such as lipid attachments remain in the membrane fraction. To determine how RCP is attached to the cell membrane, membrane fractions from NIH3T3 cells were incubated with 0.1 mNa2CO3, centrifuged, and analyzed by Western blot to determine which fraction(s) contained RCP. As shown in Fig.6 B, RCP was removed from the membrane fraction after incubation with 0.1 m Na2CO3, suggesting that it was a peripheral membrane protein. This result was confirmed by Triton X-114 phase extraction, which preferentially extracts peripheral proteins into the aqueous phase and integral or lipid-attached proteins into the detergent phase (28Battastini A.M. Emanuelli T. Koester L. Wink M.R. Bonan C.D. Dias R.D. Sarkis J.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 C, RCP was present in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 extraction of NIH3T3 membranes, indicating that RCP was attached to the membrane by ionic interactions. The view that functional G protein-coupled receptors consist of a monomeric seven transmembrane protein has been challenged by the discovery that these many receptors require additional proteins for function. The importance of such dimerization has been documented for several G protein-coupled receptors including the metabotropic glutamate receptors which form homodimers in their extracellular domain (29Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) or heterodimers with the PDZ domain containing protein Homer (30Kato A. Ozawa F. Saitoh Y. Fukazawa Y. Sugiyama H. Inokuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23969-23975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that RCP, an intracellular peripheral membrane protein, interacts specifically with the G protein-coupled receptor CRLR and facilitates signal transduction by CGRP and adrenomedullin. Previous studies have shown that both adrenomedullin and CGRP signal through a common receptor, with ligand specificity determined by co-expression of either of two chaperone proteins (RAMP1 or RAMP2). Our model for a functional CGRP receptor therefore must include at least three proteins in a complex: the ligand binding, membrane-spanning protein (CRLR), a chaperone (RAMP1 or RAMP2), and a coupling protein for signal transduction (RCP) (Fig. 3). The requirement for a triad of proteins to form a functional CGRP receptor complex can account for the difficulty in identifying the CGRP receptor. The receptor (CRLR) itself was originally cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, but did not respond to CGRP when transfected in cell culture (9Chang C.P. Pearse R.V.d. O'Connell S. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1187-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 10Fluhmann B. Muff R. Hunziker W. Fischer J.A. Born W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The accessory proteins RCP and RAMP1 were both cloned independently using a X. laevisoocyte expression cloning assay (12Luebke A.E. Dahl G.P. Roos B.A. Dickerson I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3455-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar), and CGRP receptor pharmacology was demonstrated by co-transfection of RAMP1 with CRLR into COS-7 cells. RCP did not need to be co-transfected for the CGRP receptor phenotype in these previous experiments because they were performed in COS-7 cells, which we have now shown to express endogenous RCP (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we directly demonstrated the role of RCP in CGRP and adrenomedullin-mediated signal transduction by making RCP-antisense NIH3T3 cells, in which loss of RCP correlated with loss of CGRP and adrenomedullin-mediated signal transduction (Figs. 2 and4). We could detect no change in CGRP receptor affinity or density in RCP-antisense cells compared with control cells. Thus, unlike the RAMPs, RCP does not appear to be a chaperone. Instead, RCP couples the receptor (CRLR) to the cellular signal transduction machinery, and co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. 5) suggests that RCP directly interacts with CRLR. The nature of the coupling mediated by RCP is still unclear: RCP may facilitate CRLR activation, couple the receptor to G-proteins or effector molecules, or coordinate the receptor-effector complex in the plasma membrane. Future experiments will elucidate the nature of coupling mediated by RCP. RCP is not a generic signal transduction protein, as signal transduction at two other G protein-coupled receptors in NIH3T3 cells was unaffected by the loss of RCP (Fig. 4, B and C). Instead, RCP may be specific for CRLR or restricted to a subset of G protein-coupled receptors. RCP represents a new class of proteins that facilitate signal transduction at G protein-coupled receptors and the correlation between RCP expression and CGRP potency in vivo suggests that such accessory proteins might be targets for therapeutic intervention. The requirement for accessory proteins may explain some of the G protein-coupled receptors for which no ligand is known. As the CGRP receptor (CRLR) requires RCP and RAMP for function, so might these orphan receptors require additional proteins for activation by their ligand. As additional accessory proteins are identified by protein-interaction screens, antisense studies will aid in assigning functions to this emerging class of proteins involved in signal transduction at G protein-coupled receptors."

Liss, New York1989: 109-228Google Scholar). Growing evidences support the essential role of 22:6n-3 in neuronal function. In animal models n-3 fatty acid deficiency caused memory deficit (2Gamoh S.

Nutr. 2000; 71 (suppl.): 256-267Crossref Google Scholar). In humans, various neurological disease states have been shown to be associated with a deficient 22:6n-3 status, implying the influence of this fatty acid in neuronal function (6Hoffman D.R. Birch D.G. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1998; 83: 52-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Martinez M. Brain Res. 1992; 583: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the case of preterm infants with underdeveloped brains, the inclusion of 22:6n-3 fatty acid in infant formula has been shown to improve visual attention (8Birch E.E. Hoffman D.R. Uauy R. Birch D.G. Prestidge C. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 44: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that 22:6n-3 is required for the survival of rat retinal photoreceptors (9Rotstein N.P. Aveldano M.I. Barrantes F.J. Roccamo A.M. Politi L.E. J.

Neuronal cell survival is critically dependent on the supply of trophic factors, which influences downstream signaling pathways (17Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1525-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). For example, in many cells phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent Akt serine/threonine kinase transduces a survival signal through phosphorylating proapoptotic protein BAD, which in turn associates with 14-3-3, preventing the interaction of BAD with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (18Zha J.

Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). Deprivation of trophic factors inhibits phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and subsequently BAD phosphorylation, which enables binding of BAD to Bcl-XL, resulting in mitochondrial damage. Subsequent release of cytochromec activates caspases, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death (21Green D. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that Raf-1 activation, which is known to be essential for transducing signals of many growth factors, can play an important role in the regulation of apoptotic processes (22Hoyle P.E. Moye P.W. Steelman L.S. Blalock W.L. Franklin R.A. Pearce M. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. McMahon M. McCubrey J.A.

It has been also shown that inhibition of Raf-1 in cells expressing BCR/ABL, which protects these cells from apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation, can induce apoptosis (23Neshat M.S. Raitano A.B. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Sawyers C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of constitutively active mitochondrial Raf-1 has been shown to restore antiapoptotic potential of a transformation-deficient BCR/ABL mutant (24Salomoni P. Wasik M.A. Riedel R.F. Reiss K. Choi J.K. Skorski T. Calabretta B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1995-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that activation of mitochondrial Raf-1 is involved in the antiapoptotic effect of Akt (25Majewski M. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Salomoni P. Slupianek A. Reiss K. Trotta R. Calabretta B. Skorski T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2815-2819PubMed Google Scholar). Although mechanisms of Raf-1 activation is complex and still remains controversial, translocation of Raf-1 to the membrane and subsequent phosphorylation are considered to be important steps for its activation (26Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264 (; Correction (1994) Science266, 1792–1793): 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 27Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F.

It has been shown that Raf-1 kinase contains distinct binding domains for acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid (30Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), and therefore the membrane localization of Raf-1 may be dependent on the concentration of these phospholipids. Phosphatidylserine is the major acidic phospholipid in mammalian cell membranes and is particularly enriched with 22:6n-3 fatty acid (1Salem Jr., N. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Molecular and Biochemical Aspects. Alan R. Liss, New York1989: 109-228Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that 22:6n-3, which is abundantly present in neuronal cells, promotes the accumulation of phosphatidylserine in cell membranes (31Garcia M., C. Ward G. Ma Y.C. Salem Jr., N. Kim H.Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Kim H.Y. Hamilton J. Lipids. 2000; 35: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored the biological significance of 22:6n-3 by examining its effect on apoptotic behavior upon trophic factor removal in relation to its capacity to modulate phosphatidylserine accumulation. We found that enrichment of neuronal cells with 22:6n-3 increased the accumulation of PS and the membrane localization of Raf-1, down-regulated caspase-3 activity, and prevented apoptotic cell death under serum-free conditions. Its protective potential was sensitive to the extent of PS accumulation, suggesting that the observed antiapoptotic effect of 22:6n-3 may be mediated at least in part through the enhanced PS accumulation in neuronal membranes. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM),1 fetal bovine serum, and other tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies for Raf-1 and caspase-3 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Apoptotic DNA ladder kit was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Hoechst dye #33258 (bisbenzimide trihydrochloride #33258) was purchased from Sigma. Silica gel 60 plates were obtained from Analtech (Newark, DE). Fatty acids were obtained from Nu-Check (Elysian, MN). [1-14C]Docosahexaenoic acid (50 mCi/mmol) and [3H]thymidine (15 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from American Type Cell Culture (ATCC). Cells were maintained in RMPI medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2 water saturated atmosphere. Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 5% fetal bovine serum in 75-cm2 Corning culture flasks under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed twice weekly, and cells were subcultured when confluent. For DNA fragmentation assay by sedimentation or Hoechst staining, cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 104/cm2 and 2.5 × 104/cm2, respectively. For DNA or mRNA isolation, cells were cultured in 10 ml of medium in 10-cm culture dishes. For direct exposure of cells to fatty acids, fatty acids were bound to fat-free bovine serum albumin and presented to cells in medium containing 40 μm vitamin E during serum starvation. To test the effect of fatty acid enrichment, Neuro 2A cells were supplemented with fatty acids for 24 or 48 h and then subjected to serum starvation. Fatty acid stock solutions in chloroform or methanol were dried, bound to fetal bovine serum in the presence of 40 μm vitamin E, and diluted in DMEM under the argon atmosphere so that final concentrations of fatty acids and fetal bovine serum became 25 μm and 0.5%, respectively. Non-enriched controls were treated similarly during the enrichment period, but fatty acids were omitted. The DNA fragmentation assay by differential sedimentation was performed as reported earlier (33Duke R.C. Cohen J.J. Current Protocols in Immunology , Suppl. 3. Green/Wiley, New York1992: 3.17.1-3.17.16Google Scholar). Nuclei of PC12 or Neuro 2A cells were labeled with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine for 24 h. To induce apoptosis, cells were washed gently twice with serum-free medium to remove unincorporated label and then incubated in the serum-free medium for 5–24 h. When cells were enriched with fatty acids before serum starvation, [3H]thymidine was added 24 h before the termination of enrichment. After serum starvation, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the supernatant was then precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid. This fraction (S) reflects the amount of [3H]thymidine released during apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. The remaining cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris/EDTA (TTE). The intact DNA (B) and the fragmented DNA (T) were then separated by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The fragmented DNA was precipitated from the supernatant with 25% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were resuspended in 1% SDS and subjected to liquid scintillation. The percent DNA fragmentation is expressed as the sum of counts from (S + T)/(B + S + T) × 100. Total genomic DNA was isolated from Neuro 2A cells by using an apoptotic DNA ladder assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after 48 h of serum withdrawal as mentioned above, the cells were harvested by trypsinization, suspended in 200 μl of PBS, and lysed with equal amount of lysis buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. After adding 100 μl of isopropanol, lysates were mixed, and the genomic DNA was sheared by passing a few times through a 25-gage needle attached to a 1-ml disposable syringe. The whole lysate was charged on glass filters and washed, and DNA was isolated. The isolated DNA was precipitated in ethanol and extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, air-dried, and suspended in Tris/EDTA buffer. Six to eight μg of total DNA was charged on 2% agarose gel (Bio-Rad) in loading buffer, electrophoresed in Tris-buffered EDTA buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 75 volts, and photographed under UV illumination. After 48 h of serum deprivation, the medium was centrifuged gently at 100 × g to collect detached cells, which were subsequently fixed in 250 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde. The cells still attached to the plate were fixed directly on the plate with 750 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were combined and centrifuged, and then 100 μl of Hoechst dye (24 μg/ml) dissolved in 50% glycerol/PBS was added. After incubating for at least 10 min, cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy with a 365-nm filter. Neuro 2A cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and the pellet was suspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer that contained 20% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris/HCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay using bicinchoninic acid reagent (34Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of protein were loaded onto a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at a constant current of 30 mA, then transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 45 volts for 1 h. Procaspase-3 (32 kDa) and the 17-kDa fragment were immunoblotted with anti-caspase-3 (Transduction Laboratories) and visualized by enhanced chemoluminescence detection. Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentrations in the resulting supernatants were determined by BCA assay. Aliquots were incubated with acetyl-DEVD-p-nitroanilide for 2 h at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured spectrophotometrically. Total RNA was isolated from Neuro 2A cells using TriZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and quantified spectrophotometrically. One microgram of isolated RNA was treated with DNase 1 and used for first-strand cDNA synthesis. The treated RNA was incubated with 1 μl (0.5 μg) of oligo(dT)12–18 primer for 10 min at 70 °C and reverse-transcribed by using 1 μl (200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase) of Superscript II RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 2 μl of 2 × PCR buffer, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, and 2 μl of 0.1 m of dithiothreitol. The mixture was placed in a Perkin-Elmer 2400 Gene Amp PCR system set at 42 °C for a 50-min cycle followed by a 15-min incubation at 70 °C and a 4 °C soak. After reaction, the prepared cDNA was recovered from the mixture after RNA was digested by incubating with 1 μl of RNase H (2 units) for 20 min at 37 °C. To 1–2 μl of template cDNA, 25 μl of PCR reaction buffer (PCR master mix, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added along with 1 μl (40 pmol) each of an upstream primer GTC CAG TAG CCC CAA CAA TC-3′ (a 20-mer positioned at 202 -221) and a downstream primer 5′-GCG CAG AAC AGC CAC CTC AT-3′ (a 20-mer positioned at 517–498) obtained from Lofstrand Lab, Ltd (Gaithersburg, MD). PCR was then performed using 35 cycles programmed as follows: initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C and 15 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, and primer extension for 1 min at 72 °C. One microliter (20 pmol) of each G3PDH primers (CLONTECH, California, CA) was used as a control providing a 450-base pair band. A band of 316 base pairs was visualized by illuminating under UV light after 4 μl of the PCR product was charged on 2% agarose gel containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide (Sigma) and electrophoresed for 1 h at 80 V. Neuro 2A cells were seeded on 6-well plates at a density of 4 × 105/cm in 2 ml of DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. On the next day, 0.5 μCi of [3H]22:6n-3 was added in 2 ml of DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 40 μm vitamin E. The final concentration of the fatty acid was adjusted to 20 μmwith unlabeled fatty acids. After 5, 11, 24, and 48 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin twice. Cells were collected in methanol containing 0.5% (w/v) 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (BHT), and lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (35Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were dried and reconstituted in chloroform, and aliquots were taken for radioactivity counting. The rest of the extracts were mixed with 25 μmol each of standard phospholipids and loaded on the TLC plates. Lipids were separated, and each lipid band was scraped and subjected to liquid scintillation counting as described earlier (36Garcia M.C. Kim H.Y. Brain Res. 1997; 768: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Separately, cells were enriched with 20 μm nonlabeled 18:1n-9 or 22:6n-3, and lipids were extracted as described above. Phosphatidylserine molecular species were determined by electrospray liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry as described previously (31Garcia M., C. Ward G. Ma Y.C. Salem Jr., N. Kim H.Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Kim H.Y. Hamilton J. Lipids. 2000; 35: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Kim H.Y. Wang T.C. Ma Y.C. Anal. Chem. 1994; 6: 3977-3982Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Liposomes of varying concentrations of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) were prepared by the following methods. Desired amounts of 18:0–22:6 PC, PE, and PS (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in chloroform were mixed, then dried under argon. Lipids were reconstituted in 2 ml of 75 μm2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (BHT) in cyclohexane. Samples were frozen on dry ice and then lyophilized under vacuum until only a lipid film remained. The samples were purged under argon before removing to an argon box, whereupon the lipids were reconstituted with an appropriate volume of 50 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid in PBS. Solutions were mixed with a Vortex until a colloidal suspension formed and then passed through a 0.1-μm polycarbonate filter on a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) 11 times to make unilamellar vesicles. Anti-Raf-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore, Upsala, Sweden) using Biacore X as directed by manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, upon activating the chip withN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide, bovine serum albumin-free anti-Raf was coupled to the sensor chip for a total of approximately 5000 RUs bound. After the coupling was finished, the chip surface was deactivated with ethanolamine/HCl, pH 8.5. The wash buffer used throughout was PBS. Raf-1 was captured on the chip using cell lysate from Neuro-2A cells (ATCC). The cell lysate was collected in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× PBS, 1% Igepal, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. One flow cell was kept as the control cell, and no lysate was passed over this cell. The experimental cell had 15–20 RUs of Raf-1 captured on the surface, allowing liposome and Raf-1 interaction at approximately a 1:1.5 ratio. The liposomes were injected into the flow cells, and the association with and dissociation from Raf-1 was measured. Regeneration of the anti-Raf surface was completed in a two-step process. First, 10 mmacetate, pH 4.0, was injected into the cells, followed by an injection of radioimmune precipitation buffer. After allowing the chip surface to equilibrate with PBS, the chip was again ready for use. The recovered protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using Raf-1 antibody to confirm the identity of the captured protein. After enrichment of Neuro 2A cells with fatty acids for 48 h, Neuro-2A cells were washed and grown overnight in serum-free DMEM at 37 °C. The next day, experimental cells were stimulated with 250 ng of recombinant human BDNF (Promega, Madison, WI) in 5 ml of serum-free DMEM for 5–30 min at 37 °C. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated as described earlier (30Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, after the incubation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS buffer, collected in 10 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), pelleted, and lysed by sonication in 40 μl of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin). Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifuging at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 80 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (cytosol fraction) was collected, and the membrane pellet was solubilized by sonication in 80 μl of Buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100. The protein content was measured by the BCA protein assay. The Raf-1 protein from cytosol and membrane fractions was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test or Bonfferoni/Dunn post hoc analysis. Incubation of PC-12 or Neuro 2A cells under the serum-free conditions for 5 h induced apoptotic cell death, as determined by genomic DNA fragmentation, although Neuro 2A cells yielded much less fragmentation. Although coincubation of cells with 20:4n-6 during the serum deprivation period dose-dependently decreased the genomic DNA fragmentation induced by serum starvation, 22:6n-3 (1–25 μm) was not effective at all (Fig. 1). At a higher concentration (50 μm), both fatty acids were toxic, and DNA fragmentation increased significantly. The protective effect appeared to be 20:4n-6-specific, since 12.5–25 μm18:1n-9 did not have any significant effect as was the case with 22:6n-3. Since 22:6n-3 fatty acid exists mainly as membrane phospholipids in neuronal cells, accumulation of this fatty acid in membrane phospholipids may play an important role rather than the free fatty acid itself. Therefore, Neuro 2A cells were first enriched with 25 μm 22:6n-3, and the DNA fragmentation induced by subsequent serum starvation was examined (Fig.2). Unlike the case with direct exposure of 22:6n-3 during 5-h serum starvation periods, Neuro 2A cells enriched with 22:6n-3 for 24 h before serum starvation showed considerably less DNA fragmentation in comparison with the cells enriched with 18:1n-9 or non-enriched controls. Enrichment of cells with 22:6n-3 for 48 h further protected cells, as was indicated by even less DNA fragmentation. It was observed that the extent of protection or the degree of DNA fragmentation induced by serum starvation differed depending on the cell conditions or lot to lot variations in serum or medium constituents. However, it was consistently observed that the protective effect of 22:6n-3 was improved as the cells were enriched for a longer period up to 48 h. The cells enriched with 20:4n-6 also showed similarly less DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2); however, the protective effect was sensitive to the duration of serum starvation as shown in Fig. 3. The protective effect of 20:4n-6 observed during the 24-h serum-free conditions was abolished when the cells were deprived of serum for 48 h. Only 22:6n-3 remained protective, with up to 48 h of serum starvation. Similar results were obtained for the activity of caspase-3, a member of cysteine protease family that has been shown to mediate apoptosis in mammalian cells. Neuro 2A cells were first enriched with various fatty acids for 48 h and then exposed to the serum-free medium for up to 48 h, during which period caspase-3 activity was followed. Fig.4 shows the increase of caspase-3 activity as a function of the starvation period, with the exception of cells enriched with 22:6n-3. After 24 h of serum starvation, both 20:4n-6- and 22:6n-3-treated cells showed less caspase-3 activity in comparison to non-enriched control or 18:1n-9-enriched cells. Upon prolonged serum starvation, however, the protective effect of 20:4n-6 was no longer observed, and only 22:6n-3-treated cells maintained caspase-3 activity at a level similar to 5% serum control. Neuro 2A cells exhibited a characteristic DNA ladder pattern on an agarose gel after serum starvation, confirming the occurrence of apoptotic cell death. Neuro 2A cells required at least 48 h of serum starvation for DNA ladder formation. Shown in Fig.5 is the DNA ladder observed after the cells were enriched with fatty acids for 48 h and subsequently deprived of serum for 48 h. In agreement with the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4, DNA ladder formation was significantly reduced after enrichment with 22:6n-3, whereas other fatty acids such as 18:1n-9 or 20:4n-6 did not decrea"

It consists of a coaxial waveguiding region with a low index of refraction, bounded by two cylindrical, dielectric, multilayer, omnidirectional reflecting mirrors. The waveguide can be designed to support a single mode whose properties are very similar to the unique transverse electromagnetic mode of a traditional metallic coaxial cable. The new mode has radial symmetry and a point of zero dispersion. Moreover, because the light is not confined by total internal reflection, the waveguide can guide light around very sharp corners."
https://openalex.org/W1968416067,"The developmental mechanisms specifying digital identity have attracted 30 years of intense interest, but still remain poorly understood. Here, through experiments on chick foot development, we show digital identity is not a fixed property of digital primordia. Rather, digital identity is specified by the interdigital mesoderm, demonstrating a patterning function for this tissue before its regression. More posterior interdigits specify more posterior digital identities, and each primordium will develop in accordance with the most posterior cues received. Furthermore, inhibition of interdigital bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling can transform digit identity, suggesting a role for BMPs in this process."

In this study, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the thrombospondins 1 (TSP1) and 2 (TSP2) properdin-like type 1 repeats (TSR). One of the proteins identified that interacted with both TSR was matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). The isolated MMP2 cDNA clone encoded amino acid residues 237–633, which include the fibronectin-like gelatin binding region flanking the catalytic center and the carboxyl hemopexin-like region. Further testing of this clone demonstrated that the TSR interacted with the NH2-terminal region of the MMP2 that contains the catalytic domain. The protein interaction observed in yeast was further demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using purified intact TSP1, TSP2, MMP2, and MMP9. Although MMP2 interacted with TSP1 and TSP2 via its gelatin-binding domain or a closely mapping site, neither TSP1 nor TSP2 was degraded by MMP2 in vitro. Tissue culture and in vitro assays demonstrated that the presence of purified TSR and intact TSP1 resulted in inhibition of MMP activity. The ability of TSP1 to inhibit MMP3-dependent activation of pro-MMP9 and thrombin-induced activation of pro-MMP2 suggests that the TSPs may inhibit MMP activity by preventing activation of the MMP2 and MMP9 zymogens.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3290-3299Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Each thrombospondin contains NH2- and COOH-terminal globular domains flanking different structural modules (Ref. 2Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 A). The modules common to all TSP proteins include epidermal growth factor-like type 2 and Ca2+-binding type 3 repeats. In addition to these common features, TSP1 and TSP2 share two additional modules: a procollagen homology region and three properdin-like type 1 repeats (TSR). The NH2 and COOH termini contain regions that are low in cysteine content, do not possess internal repeating motifs, and do not show homology with other proteins (3Lawler J. Duquette M. Urry L. McHenry K. Smith T.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain is largely responsible for the heparin binding properties of thrombospondins (4Sun X. Mosher D.F. Rapraeger A. J. Biol.

TSP1 contains a growing number of sites that have been implicated in interactions with more than 30 cell surface and matrix proteins, including structural proteins (e.g. collagen and fibronectin), cell surface receptors (e.g. integrins, syndecans, and CD36), enzymes (e.g. elastase and plasmin), and cytokines (e.g. transforming growth factor-β1) (17Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Because of its ability to interact with such a wide variety of proteins, TSP1 has been implicated in a number of biological processes including coagulation, cell adhesion, cell growth, modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, control of tumor growth and metastases, and angiogenesis (18Sage E.H. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14831-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J.

However, the relative importance and physiological roles of these interactions are poorly understood. TSP1 was initially recognized as an inhibitor of angiogenesis with the isolation from the medium of the hamster cell line BHK21/c113 of a 140-kDa protein capable of inhibiting neovascularization induced by angiogenic factors (22Rastinejad F. Polverini P.J. Bouck N.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 345-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Subsequent structure-function studies (23Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) localized the anti-angiogenic region of TSP1 to the procollagen-like region and the TSR. Intact TSP2 has also been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (24Volpert O.V. Tolsma S.S. Pellerin S. Feige J.J. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Bouck N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. LaMarca M. McKinney C.E. Ginns E.I. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) demonstrated increased tissue vascularity, consistent with the proposed anti-angiogenic activity of TSP2. Since TSP2 shows poor sequence homology to TSP1 in the procollagen region but good matches in the TSR region, it has been suggested that the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP2 maps to the TSR (27Tolsma S.S. Volpert O.V. Good D.J. Frazier W.A. Polverini P.J. Bouck N. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the sequence CSVTCG within the TSR of TSP1 interacts with the surface receptor glycoprotein CD36 (28Asch A.S. Silbiger S. Heimer E. Nachman R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1208-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and mediates the in vitro andin vivo inhibitory effects of TSP1 on endothelial cells (29Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F. Zhong R.

Med. 2000; 6: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). However, although peptides containing the sequence VTCG were the most effective in their anti-angiogenic properties, corresponding peptides lacking VTCG and different peptides derived from the procollagen region were also active. Furthermore, recent studies showed that the TSP1 TSR inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and migration in a CD36-independent manner (31Guo N. Zabrenetzky V.S. Chandrasekaran L. Sipes J.M. Lawler J. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3154-3162PubMed Google Scholar). These observations led to the conclusion that more than one structural domain and possible mechanism are involved in the inhibition of neovascularization by TSP1 (27Tolsma S.S. Volpert O.V. Good D.J.

Bain S.D. Yang Z. Lin M.T. Danielson K.G. Iozzo R.V. LaMarca M. McKinney C.E. Ginns E.I. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 32Lawler J.

The present study was undertaken to systematically identify and study proteins interacting with the TSR domains of TSP1 and TSP2. To this end, we used the TSP2 TSR, containing three repeats of approximately 55 amino acids each, as a bait for screening an activation domain-cDNA translational fusion library using the yeast two-hybrid system. The obtained clones were then screened with a TSP1 type 1 repeat construct to identify proteins interacting with both TSP2 and TSP1 or only TSP2. One such protein, interacting with both thrombospondins, is MMP2. The binding is mediated by residues 237–445 of MMP2, which include the fibronectin-like gelatin binding domain and catalytic center domain, and results in inhibition of MMP catalytic activity. The Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain Y190 (CLONTECH) was used for cDNA library screening and for direct testing of protein-protein interactions. The cells were grown at 30 °C either in rich YPD medium or minimal media with appropriate amino acid supplements. The minimal media were SD −Trp, in which tryptophan was omitted; SD −Leu, in which leucine was omitted; SD −Trp,Leu, in which tryptophan and leucine were omitted; and SD −Trp,Leu,His, in which tryptophan, leucine, and histidine were omitted. The cell line ECV304 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated from aorta obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Cells were maintained in M199 (ECV304) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BAEC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Constructs for use in the yeast two-hybrid system were based on the MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 2, which includes the cloning vectors pAS2–1 and pACT2 (CLONTECH). The pAS2–1 vector carries the nutritional marker TRP1 and allows the design of constructs, referred to as the bait, for the expression of fusion proteins carboxyl to the GAL4-(1–147) DNA binding domain. The pACT2 vector carries the nutritional marker LEU2 and allows the design of constructs, referred to as the prey, for expression of fusion proteins carboxyl to the GAL4-(768–881) activation domain. To construct a bait vector with a second reading frame, the vector pAS2–1 was linearized withNcoI, filled in using T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated. The vector was designated pAS2–2. The NIH 3T3 activation cDNA library constructed in the vector pACT2 was purchased fromCLONTECH. Deletion plasmids of MMP2, designated pACT-MMP2-(237–445) and pACT-MMP2-(440–633) were also constructed (Fig. 1 B). The TSP1 and -2 TSR corresponding to nucleotides 1342–1861 and 1356–1876 (33Laherty C.D., K, O.R. Wolf F.W. Katz R. Seldin M.F. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3274-3281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using full-length TSP1 and TSP2 cDNA templates (kindly provided by Dr. J. Lawler and Dr. I. Arispe, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). To amplify the TSP1 TSR, the sense primer, including a custom NdeI site, had the sequence 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCTGACGATGGCTGGTC-3′, and the antisense primer, including a translational termination codon and anXhoI site, had the sequence 5′-CCGCTCGAGCTCATCCATCAATTGGGCAGTCCT-3′. To amplify the TSP2 TSR, the sense primer, including a custom SmaI site, had the sequence 5′-TCCCCCGGGGATGAGGGCTGGTCTCCGTG-3′, and the antisense primer including a translational termination codon and an XbaI site had the sequence 5′-GCTCTAGATCACCCATCAATAGGGCAGCT-3′. The TSP1 type 1 and 2 TSR were cloned in the vectors pAS2–1 and pAS2–2, respectively. For production of recombinant protein, the TSR were cloned in the yeast expression vector pYEX4T-1 (CLONTECH). PCR was performed using a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using 25 cycles, with temperature of 94 °C and 1 min for denaturing, 62 °C and 1 min for annealing, and 72 °C and 2 min for extension. Transformation of Y190 cells was performed using lithium acetate according to the protocols ofCLONTECH. The pAS2-based bait constructs were transformed into Y190 cells and selected on SD −Trp medium, while pACT2-based prey constructs were selected on SD −Leu medium. The double transformants were selected on SD −Trp,Leu,His medium containing 45 mm3-azo-1,2,4-triazole. The pAS2-TSP2-type 1 construct was used for screening the cDNA translational library in pACT2. Plates were incubated for up to 14 days at 30 °C. Interactions between baits and preys were assessed by their ability to transactivate the reporter genes HIS3 and lacZ. HIS+ colonies were transferred to SD −His,Trp,Leu plates containing 45 mm3-azo-1,2,4-triazole and tested at least twice for color reactivity in the β-galactosidase colony filter assay. For the β-galactosidase assay, yeast colonies were lifted to filters (VWR Grade 410) that were then submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10–20 s and thawed at room temperature. The membranes were incubated, colonies side up, at 30 °C on top of another membrane presoaked with Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, pH 7.0, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and 1 mg/ml X-gal. Positive colonies were counter-selected in minimal SD −Leu liquid medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Plasmid DNA was rescued from counter-selected colonies by cracking the cells in the presence of glass beads followed by purification using Geneclean glass milk beads (Bio 101). The isolated plasmid DNA was electroporated into XL1-Blue cells. XL1-Blue cells were grown to A 6000.5–0.7 and washed two times with H2O. The bacterial cells were electroporated using Bio-Rad GenePulser at a setting of 1.5 kV, 10 microfarads, and 600 ohms. Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformants using the Bio 101 kit. Partial nucleotide sequence was obtained by automated sequencing and searched against the GenBankTMdata base using the BLAST program. The full-length murine TSP2 cDNA was inserted in the cloning site of the vector pSP72 (Promega). In vitro transcription/translation reaction was performed using Promega's T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system.In vitro translation was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine (1300 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A tube containing purified human platelet TSP1 (0.3 μg; Calbiochem) or in vitro translated murine TSP2 and purified MMP2 or MMP9 (0.1 μg; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was incubated at 4 °C in 1× PBS for 4 h. The solution was precleared by adding 20 μl of protein G-Plus/protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) or protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 16 h in the presence of anti-MMP2 or anti-MMP9 antibody (1:200; Triple Point Biologics) and protein G-Plus/protein A or protein A-agarose beads. The beads were precipitated, washed repeatedly with PBS, and resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer for SDS-PAGE analysis. For Western blot analysis, after transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) overnight at 24 V, the membrane was rinsed twice (5 min each) in TBS and blocked for 1 h with 0.2% nonfat milk in TBS. The membrane was then incubated with rabbit anti-human TSP1 antibody (a kind gift of Dr. J. Lawler) in 0.2% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The membrane was washed and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The blot was developed using an Immun-Star chemiluminescent protein detection system (Bio-Rad). For fluorography, the gel was impregnated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by incubating in PEG8500. The gel was then dried using a gel drier and exposed to X-Omat AR film. The yeast strain DY150 (CLONTECH) was transformed with pYEX 4T-1 (vector), pYEX-TSP1-type 1, or pYEX-TSP2-type 1 repeat constructs. Transformants were grown at 30 °C, as recommended by the supplier, toA 600 = 0.8–1.2. The culture was supplemented with copper sulfate to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and further grown for 1 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended in the lysis buffer containing acid-washed glass beads, and disrupted by vigorous vortexing. Cell extract was collected, and GST and GST-tagged proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified protein products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. The TSP1 and TSP2 TSR were detected by using the anti-human TSP1 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. J. Lawler) and anti-mouse TSP2 antibody (a kind gift of Dr. P. Bornstein, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Pro-MMP2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was activated at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA). Alternatively, active MMP2 (Calbiochem) was used for enzymatic assays. Enzymatic assays were performed using 3H-labeled gelatin or collagen IV as substrates. The MMP2 assay buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Brij-35. Pro-MMP9 (Calbiochem) was activated with MMP3 (Sigma) in the absence or presence of TSP1 (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for periods of 0–2 h. Pro-MMP9 enzyme activation and assays were in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. Aliquots of the activation mixture were used for enzyme activity measurement using3H-labeled gelatin substrate. Gelatinase or collagenase activity was assayed using heat-denatured rat 3H-labeled collagen type 1 (gelatin) or human 3H-labeled collagen type IV (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively, as a substrate as described before (34Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine collagenolytic or gelatinolytic activity by cultured cells human [3H]collagen type IV or heated rat [3H]collagen type I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a monolayer of cells in six-well culture plates (50,000 dpm/well) in the presence of serum-free medium. Confluent monolayers of ECV304 or BAEC cells were incubated in serum-free medium. Labeled collagen type IV added to a monolayer of cells was recovered with 100% efficiency when the supernatant medium was collected (results not shown). In contrast, a significant portion of the same medium added to tissue culture plates without cells nonspecifically adsorbs to the plates. A measure of degradation of the substrate medium incubated in a 15-ml screw-cap tube in the absence of cells was used for determining the blank values. The gelatinolytic or collagenolytic activity reactions were terminated by the addition of 3.5 mm EDTA and 0.03% bovine serum albumin. The sample was then precipitated with 0.06% tannic acid and 1% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid precipitation of the mixture and determination of the radioactivity in the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction using a β-scintillation counter gave a measure of the collagenolytic or gelatinolytic activity by the cultured cells. To examine the effect of purified TSP1 protein on MMP2 and MMP9 enzyme levels, passage 3–6 BAEC were seeded in 48-well plates and grown to confluence. After a 16–48-h incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and serum-free medium was added. After a 16-h incubation, the medium was removed, the monolayer was washed once with PBS, and 100 μl of fresh serum-free medium with or without intact TSP1 (25 μg/ml) was added. During a 4-h incubation period, aliquots of conditioned medium (15 μl each) were collected for zymographic analysis of MMP2 and MMP9 enzyme levels. Gelatin zymography was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice (30 min each) in 2.5% Triton X-100 and incubated in zymography buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2% NaN3) overnight. Gelatinolytic activity was visualized as clear zones with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. To identify proteins that bind to the TSP2 TSR, we screened a NIH 3T3 cDNA translational library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Before proceeding with the screening, the bait plasmid, which contains the TSP2 TSR was tested for its inability to activate the prototrophic reporter geneHIS3. During the library screen, protein interaction was detected by the expression of the reporter genes HIS3 and the color indicator lacZ. Thirty-nine clones showedlacZ expression on X-gal indicator filters. These clones were then counter-selected in Leu− medium supplemented with cycloheximide that favors clones carrying the library insert due to the presence of the CYH s 2 gene, which confers sensitivity to cycloheximide, in the pAS2–1 vector. Plasmid DNA was isolated from each of the 39 positive yeast clones. Sequencing analyses of the inserts showed that three clones encoded fibronectin, two encoded lysyl oxidase-like protein, and the remaining 34 clones represented independent genes, 16 of which could be identified on the basis of available sequence. The present study focuses on one of the known interactors identified, MMP2. The isolated MMP2-encoding cDNA clone contained amino acid residues 237–633 of the mouse MMP2 sequence (Ref. 35Reponen P.

The NH2-terminal residue of the MMP2 cDNA clone isolated from the library localizes inside the first repeat of the fibronectin-like segment inserted in the MMP2 protein. Thus, the clone contains the next two complete 58-residue repeats. In order to examine if the ability of TSP2 TSR to bind to MMP2 was also shared by TSP1 TSR, the corresponding TSP1 cDNA was inserted in frame in the pAS2–1 vector and tested using the yeast two-hybrid system. Similar to TSP2 TSR, the TSP1 TSR-containing plasmid construct conferred on Y190 cells the ability to transactivate the reporter genesHIS3 and lacZ (TableI).Table ITSR interactions with MMP2BaitPreypACT2 (vector)pACT2-MMP2-(237–633)pACT2-MMP2-(237–445)pACT2-MMP2-(440–633)pAS2-1 (vector)−−−−pAS2-TSP1-type 1 repeat−++−pAS2-TSP2-type 1 repeat−++−Interaction of TSR with MMP2 in yeast as measured by colony growth and β-galactosidase filter assay.

Protein-protein interaction was determined by colony growth followed by an assay for β-galactosidase activity. +, interaction; −, no interaction. To further map the MMP2 region that binds to the TSP1 and TSP2 TSR, we employed two prey constructs, pACT-MMP2-(237–445) and pACT-MMP2-(440–633). These constructs encode fusion proteins between the GAL4 activation domain and the NH2-terminal half of the MMP2 clone obtained, which includes the fibronectin-like gelatin-binding domain along with the catalytic center, and the COOH-terminal half of MMP2, which includes the hemopexin-like domain, respectively (Fig. 1 B). There was no detectable interaction with the carboxyl hemopexin-like end, whereas both the TSP1 and TSP2 TSR interacted with the NH2-terminal half of MMP2 (TableI). These studies suggested that both TSP1 and TSP2 TSR interact with MMP2 and that residues within the MMP2 catalytic domain are responsible for this interaction. To verify that the interaction detected using the yeast two-hybrid system occurs outside of yeast and to show its relevance within the context of the intact protein, we studied the interaction of purified intact human platelet TSP1 (hTSP1) or in vitro translated mouse TSP2 and human MMP2 (hMMP2) or the closely related human MMP9 (hMMP9) in in vitro binding assays. Immunoprecipitation ofin vitro mixture of hTSP1 and hMMP2 or hMMP9 with anti-hMMP2 or anti-hMMP9 antibody, respectively, followed by immunoblotting with anti-hTSP1 antibody demonstrated the presence of TSP1 protein when both TSP1 and hMMP2 or hMMP9 were presented in the mixture (Fig.2 A). TSP1 associated with MMP2 (left panel) or MMP9 (right panel), and thus it was immunoprecipitated with anti-MMP2 or anti-MMP9 antibody, respectively. A control TSP1 sample that was not subjected to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A,control) was included to confirm the size and specificity of the band detected. In order to explore in vitro interactions of TSP2 and MMP2 or MMP9, a full-length TSP2 protein was generated by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Radiographic analysis of the translation products showed a band of ∼130–150 kDa, consistent with the expected size of the unglycosylated intact TSP2. Similar to TSP1, in vitrotranslated TSP2 was precipitated using anti-MMP2 or anti-MMP9 antibody from a mixture of TSP2 and MMP2 or MMP9 (Fig. 2 B). These results confirm the interaction between MMP2 and the TSR detected in the yeast two-hybrid system and confirm that TSP1 and -2 bind to MMP2 and MMP9. MMP2 has been found to degrade a number of matricellular proteins including fibronectin; collagens IV, V, and VII; and gelatin (36Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Gr"

Target site recognition involves modifiable base-pairing interactions between the intron RNA and a &gt;14-nucleotide region of the DNA target site, as well as fixed interactions between the protein and flanking regions. Here, we developed a highly efficient Escherichia coli genetic assay to determine detailed target site recognition rules for the Lactococcus lactis group II intron Ll.LtrB and to select introns that insert into desired target sites. Using human immunodeficiency virus–type 1 (HIV-1) proviral DNA and the human CCR5 gene as examples, we show that group II introns can be retargeted to insert efficiently into virtually any target DNA and that the retargeted introns retain activity in human cells. This work provides the practical basis for potential applications of targeted group II introns in genetic engineering, functional genomics, and gene therapy."

In this report, we demonstrate that TNF-α prevents TGF-β-induced Smad-specific gene transactivation without inducing detectable levels of inhibitory Smad7 in human dermal fibroblasts. On the other hand, c-Jun and JunB, both induced by TNF-α, block Smad3-mediated transcription. Expression of antisense c-Jun mRNA prevents TNF-α inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling whereas that of dominant-negative Iκ-B kinase-α or antisense Smad7 does not. We provide evidence for off-DNA interactions between Smad3 and both c-Jun and JunB accompanied with reduced Smad3-DNA interactions. Finally, we show that overexpression of the transcriptional co-activator p300 prevents TNF-α/AP-1 inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling. These data suggest that TNF-α interferes with Smad signaling through the induction of AP-1 components, the latter forming off-DNA complexes with Smad3 and preventing its binding to specific cis-element(s).

Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals through serine/threonine kinase transmembrane receptors, which phosphorylate cytoplasmic mediators of the Smad family (3Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 4Massagué J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644PubMed Google Scholar). The Smad protein family can be divided into three groups. The receptor-associated Smads such as Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5 interact directly with and are phosphorylated by activated TGF-β receptor type I (TBRI or BMPRI) and are ligand-specific (5Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, these form heteromeric complexes with Smad4, which is a common mediator for all Smad pathways (5Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). These heterocomplexes are then translocated into the nucleus where they function as transcription factors, binding DNA either directly or in association with other proteins (6Massagué J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a third group of Smad proteins, the inhibitory Smads such as Smad6 and Smad7, prevents phosphorylation and/or nuclear translocation of receptor-associated Smads (3Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in HIV reactivation, graft versus host disease, scleroderma, and shock (7Goldring M.B. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Prior to its activation, the 26-kDa TNF-α pro-peptide is proteolytically converted to its active 17-kDa form. After subsequent trimerization, TNF-α binds and activates two distinct membrane-bound receptors, the 55-kDa type I receptor (TNFR1) and the 75-kDa type II receptor (TNFR2), found on most cell types. Most effects are transduced by TNFR1, and the most characterized transcription factor families activated by TNF-α are NF-κB and AP-1. NF-κB consists of dimers of proteins of the Rel family (9Bauerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4563) Google Scholar, 10Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu.

Prior to activation, homo- and heterodimeric members of the Rel family are held latent in the cytoplasm by Iκ-B family members. Upon appropriate stimulation, a series of phosphorylation events occurs, terminating on Iκ-B via the Iκ-B kinase-α (Ikk-α) (11Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar) leading to its degradation and to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Expression and activation of the AP-1 family of transcription factors represent another essential pathway by which numerous biological effects of TNF-α are mediated (7Goldring M.B. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 8DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Wainberg M. Hiscott J.

They consist of homo- and heterodimers of the protein products of the fos and jun gene families, characterized by a leucine-zipper structure allowing dimerization and subsequent DNA binding to the consensus DNA sequence TGAGTCA (12Karin M.

AP-1 transcription factors have also been implicated in some of the TGF-β regulatory effects on gene expression such as the modulation, either negative or positive, of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), or transin (rat MMP-3) (14Kerr L.D.

In the context of tissue remodeling, TGF-β essentially plays an anabolic role favoring extracellular matrix deposition. On the other hand, TNF-α is known to antagonize most of TGF-β effects on gene expression (16Mauviel A. Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol.

To date, however, despite numerous evidences for the antagonistic activities of TGF-β and TNF-α, it is not clear whether TNF-α directly interferes with Smad signaling, and if so, its mechanism. It has been recently suggested that TNF-α through NF-κB activation can either induce or inhibit Smad7 expression, a molecule that interferes with Smad phosphorylation by TBRI and subsequent translocation into the cell nucleus.

TNF-α alters inhibitory Smad7 expression in a cell type-specific manner, as RelA translocation induces Smad7 expression and subsequent blockade of TGF-β signaling in mouse embryo fibroblasts (20Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G.

Harrington M.A. Nakshatri H. Chen Y. Biochem J. 2000; 348: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the relative contributions of both AP-1 and NF-κB pathways in mediating TNF-α effects on TGF-β/Smad signaling in human dermal fibroblasts. We provide evidence for an essential role of AP-1 (c-Jun and JunB) downstream of TNF-α in blocking Smad signaling. We also demonstrate that NF-κB activation by TNF-α does not lead to significant expression of Smad7 in this cell type and that blockade of either the NF-κB pathway or Smad7 expression does not alter TNF-α effect on Smad signaling, as opposed to blockade of c-Jun expression. Our data suggest that TNF-α repression of Smad signaling may be achieved through repression of the transcriptional effects of Smad3 within the cell nucleus, by c-Jun and JunB, which directly interfere at the level of Smad3-DNA interactions and subsequent gene transactivation. Human dermal fibroblast cultures, established by explanting tissue specimens obtained from neonatal foreskins, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin-G and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizoneô), and utilized in passages 3–8. Human recombinant TGF-β1 and TNF-α were from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). (SBE)4-Lux (22Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol.

For c-Jun and JunB expression, we used a full-length human cDNA in pRSVe expression vector (Ref. 23Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin, La Jolla, CA). Tagged Smad2, Smad3, c-Jun, and JunB vectors were obtained by subcloning the entire coding sequences into either pCDNA3-FLAG, pCDNA3-Myc, or pCDNA3-HA. G5E1b-Lux containing five Gal4 binding sites driving the expression of luciferase and Gal4BD·Smad3 fusion protein expression vector, containing the full-length Smad3 cDNA excised from pGEX-Smad3 (kind gift from Dr. R. Derynck, University of California, San Francisco) and subcloned in frame with the Gal4 DNA binding domain into pSG24, has been described previously (24Atfi A. Buisine M. Mazars A. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24731-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). p300 expression vector was a kind gift from Dr. T. Shioda, Boston, MA. Integrity of all constructs was verified by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Transient cell transfections of human dermal fibroblasts were performed with the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation procedure using a commercial assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Following appropriate incubation periods (see figure legends), the cells were rinsed one time with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer. pRSV-β-galactosidase was co-transfected in every experiment, and the β-galactosidase activities were used to monitor transfection efficiency. Aliquots corresponding to identical β-galactosidase activity were used for each reporter assay. Luciferase activity was determined with a commercial assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. T7 promoter-driven transcription and transduction of Smad2-FLAG, Smad3·Myc, c-Jun·HA, and JunB-FLAG proteins were performed in a single tube assay (TnT®, Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 39-base pair Smad-specific probe (3× CAGA, Ref. 25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar) was used to determine the effect of TNF-α on TGF-β-induced Smad-DNA interactions. Nuclear extracts were isolated using a small scale preparation (26Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) aliquoted into small fractions to avoid repetitive freeze-thawing, and stored at −80 °C until use. The protein concentration in the extracts was determined using a commercial assay kit (Bio-Rad). Binding mixtures were separated electrophoretically on 4% acrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA as described previously (27Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J.

COS-7 cells were transfected with activated TGF-β receptor type I expression vector together with tagged Smad3 and c-Jun tagged expression vectors. Forty hours later, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and solubilized in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were cleared of debris by centrifugation and incubated with anti-Myc 9E10 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After five washes with solubilization buffer, the immunoprecipitates were eluted by boiling for 3 min in SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 36% glycerol, 4% SDS) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, immunoblotted with appropriate anti-HA, -FLAG, and -Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have previously established that TNF-α is a potent antagonist of TGF-β-induced COL1A2 promoter activity (18Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Activation of the latter promoter by TGF-β has recently been shown to involve Smad3/4 (29Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To determine precisely whether TNF-α may exert an inhibitory activity on Smad-specific transcription and to circumvent any interference of additional non-Smad-specific cis-elements, we examined the modulation of (SBE)4-Lux, a reporter construct in which four tandem repeats of a consensus Smad3/4 binding element (SBE, Ref. 22Zawel L. Le Dai J. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) drive the expression of the luciferase gene. As shown in Fig.1 and as expected from the literature, TGF-β-enhanced (SBE)4-Lux activity approximately 3-fold above control levels. Interestingly, this induction was completely abolished by addition of TNF-α 1 h prior to TGF-β. A recent report has shown that Smad7 induction by TNF-α via NF-κB activation may be responsible for its ability to interfere with the Smad-signaling pathway in mouse fibroblasts (20Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Smad7 was recently identified as a direct Smad3/4 target downstream of TGF-β (30von Gersdorff G. Susztak K. Rezvani F. Bitzer M. Liang D. Böttinger E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11320-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, Smad7 promoter activity is inhibited by TNF-α through NF-κB in 293 cells (21Nagarajan R.P. Chen F. Li W. Vig E. Harrington M.A. Nakshatri H. Chen Y. Biochem J. 2000; 348: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consistent with the known inhibitory activity of Smad7 on TGF-β/Smad signaling, we observed that overexpression of Smad7 efficiently blocked the TGF-β effect on (SBE)4-Lux activity (data not shown). Therefore, we tested whether Smad7 was rapidly induced by TNF-α and by TGF-β in our experimental system and could therefore account for the inhibitory activity of TNF-α on Smad-driven gene transactivation. For this purpose, confluent fibroblast cultures were treated for 1 h with TNF-α prior to addition of TGF-β. Three hours later, total cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-Smad7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, neither TNF-α nor TGF-β induced detectable levels of Smad7. In contrast, c-Jun levels were markedly elevated by TNF-α, but not by TGF-β, consistent with our previous observations (16Mauviel A. Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 31Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Functionality of the anti-Smad7 antibody was verified using cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with a Smad7 expression vector pGFP-Smad7 in the presence or absence of the antisense Smad7 vector pGFP-ASSmad7 (Fig. 2 B). A strong Smad7 signal was detected in Smad7-transfected COS-7 cell extracts, and this signal was significantly lowered when the antisense vector was co-transfected. These data establish both the functionality of the anti-Smad7 antibody to recognize its antigen and the efficacy of the antisense Smad7 vector to block Smad7 expression. We have previously shown that transactivation of the human COL1A2promoter by TGF-β is abolished by c-Jun overexpression (18Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because c-Jun and JunB are both potently induced by TNF-α in dermal fibroblasts (31Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of their overexpression on Smad3-mediated transactivation of the reporter constructs (SBE)4-Lux. As shown in Fig.3, neither JunB nor c-Jun had an effect on the basal activity of the construct, whereas Smad3 overexpression induced its activity by several times. When co-expressed with Smad3, JunB abrogated Smad3-dependent transactivation of (SBE)4-Lux in a dose-dependent manner, reaching 80% when identical amounts of Jun and Smad3 expression vectors were used. Similarly, c-Jun overexpression did not modify the basal activity of the construct but strongly inhibited Smad3-mediated transactivation. These results indicate that both c-Jun and JunB members of the AP-1 family directly antagonize Smad3-driven gene transactivation. To determine the relative contributions of the AP-1 and NF-κB pathways on TNF-α inhibition of TGF-β/Smad signaling, (SBE)4-Lux was co-transfected in parallel with either an antisense c-Jun vector pRSV-ASc-Jun or a dominant-negative Ikk-α expression vector pD/N-Ikk-α or pGFP-ASSmad7. As shown in Fig. 4, pRSV-ASc-Jun expression prevented the TNF-α inhibitory effect on (SBE)4-Lux transactivation by TGF-β, whereas empty pRSV had no effect. Contrary to pRSV-ASc-Jun, neither pD/N-Ikk-α nor pGFP-ASSmad7 had an effect on the inhibitory activity exerted by TNF-α on TGF-β-induced Smad (SBE)4-Lux transactivation. Efficient NF-κB activation/translocation by TNF-α was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide as a probe and nuclear extracts from parallel controls or TNF-α-treated (30 min) fibroblast cultures (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that c-Jun, not NF-κB/Smad7 is responsible for TNF-α inhibition of Smad signaling in human dermal fibroblasts. To investigate the mechanisms by which c-Jun antagonizes Smad-mediated gene transactivation, we first examined the ability of Smad3 and Jun proteins to participate in off-DNA protein-protein interactions. For this purpose, COS-7 cells were transfected with Smad3·Myc and c-Jun·HA expression vectors. Immunoprecipitations of the cell lysates were performed with an anti-Myc, followed by Western blot anaylsis with anti-Myc and anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies. As demonstrated in Fig.5, c-Jun interacts with Smad3 off-DNA, as evidenced by the co-precipitation of c-Jun·HA together with Smad3·Myc. Alternatively, COS-7 cells were transfected with Smad3·FLAG and JunB·Myc expression vectors. In the latter case, we observed co-immunoprecipitation of Smad3·FLAG with JunB·Myc (data not shown). These data establish the capacity of Smad3 to form heterocomplexes with Jun family members off-DNA, and corroborate recent observations (32Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 33Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We next tested the ability of c-Jun to interact with Smad3/4 in the context of TGF-β-induced Smad·DNA complexes. For this purpose, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts from TGF-β-stimulated fibroblast cultures incubated with a radiolabeled 3× CAGA probe. In vitro transcribed c-Jun or JunB were added to the binding reactions, and their effects on TGF-β-induced Smad·DNA complex formation was determined. As shown in Fig. 6 A, and as expected from our previous observations (27Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 28Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J. Kon A. de Caestecker M.P. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14769-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), TGF-β induced the formation of a unique Smad/DNA complex (Fig. 6 A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Addition of in vitro synthesized c-Jun to the binding reaction strongly diminished Smad interactions with DNA, as compared with addition of an identical amount of mock TnT® reaction (Fig. 6 A, lane 4 versus lane 2). Quantitation with a phosphor imager of the radioactivity present in the Smad·DNA complexes in lanes 2 and 4 indicated 80% reduction in Smad·DNA complex formation upon c-Jun addition, whereas no change was induced by addition of an equal amount of Smad2 (Fig. 6 A, lane 6). A similar reduction in Smad·DNA complex formation was also observed when JunB was added to the Smad-DNA binding reaction instead of c-Jun, although slightly less marked (approximately 50% reduction in Smad·DNA complex formation (Fig. 6 B, lane 4 versus lane 2). From these experiments, it is suggested that off-DNA Smad3-AP-1 interactions may sequester some of the available Smad3 and compete against Smad binding to its cognate cis-element, a phenomenon that likely inhibits Smad3-dependent transcription. Another possibility for AP-1 members to interfere with the Smad pathway would be to compete for certain co-factors necessary for optimal transcriptional responses. One such factor is p300. Because the amount of p300 is limiting within the cell nucleus (34Hottiger M.O. Felzien L.K. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3124-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), formation of c-Jun·p300 complexes may reduce the amount of p300 available to Smad3 for optimal transcription. If this scenario is correct, then overexpression of p300 should overcome the inhibitory effect of TNF-α/c-Jun on TGF-β/Smad3 activation of the (SBE)4-Lux construct. To test this hypothesis, we first measured the effect of p300 overexpression on c-Jun inhibition of (SBE)4-Lux transactivation by Smad3. As shown in Fig.7 A, p300 overexpression prevented the inhibitory effect of c-Jun. Similarly, p300 overexpression overcame the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on TGF-β-mediated (SBE)4-Lux transactivation (Fig.7 B).It should also be noted that p300 overexpression resulted in increased (SBE)4-Lux activity in response to both TGF-β stimulation and Smad3 overexpression, a result which is consistent with the concept of limited availability of p300 and which confirms the recently described role of p300 as a Smad3 co-activator (35Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 36Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2114-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 37Shen X. Hu P.P. Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The role of p300 as a Smad3 co-activator with limited availability was further examined in a Gal4·Smad3 fusion protein-based transactivation assay. As shown in Fig. 7 C, this Gal4 fusion-based assay fully recapitulated the data obtained with the (SBE)4-Lux construct. Specifically, Gal4·Smad3, but not c-Jun, activated the reporter gene containing five Gal4 binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene. This activation by Gal4·Smad3 was repressed by c-Jun and enhanced by p300 overexpresion, the latter preventing the inhibitory effect of c-Jun. Together, these data demonstrate that c-Jun competes against Smad3 for the available p300 in the cell nucleus. The latter mechanism, in turn, would act in concert with direct off-DNA Smad3-Jun interactions to decrease Smad3-specific gene transcription. We report a mechanism of suppression of TGF-β/Smad3 signaling by TNF-α, which involves the transcription factors c-Jun and JunB. These AP-1 components are key factors in the transmission of signals from various pro-inflammatory cytokines known to antagonize TGF-β in the context of tissue repair and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. This phenomenon is complementary to a recently uncovered mechanism by which TNF-α may block Smad signaling. Specifically, it has been shown that, in certain situations, RelA/NF-κB can induce the expression of the inhibitory Smad7, and stabilize the association of the latter with activated TGF-β type I receptors (20Bitzer M. von Gersdorff G. Liang D. Dominguez-Rosales A. Beg A.A. Rojkind M. Böttinger E.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 187-197PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Smad7 induction by TNF-α via RelA activation could represent a mechanism by which TNF-α antagonizes TGF-β signaling at the level of TGF-β type I receptor function by preventing Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation and subsequent translocation into the nucleus. This is, however, not a universal mechanism because other reports indicate (a) that TNF-α or NF-κB overexpression inhibits Smad7 promoter activity human embryonic 293 kidney cells (21Nagarajan R.P. Chen F. Li W. Vig E. Harrington M.A. Nakshatri H. Chen Y. Biochem J. 2000; 348: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and (b) that neither TNF-α nor TGF-β induce Smad7 expression in endothelial cells (38Topper J.N. Cai J. Qiu Y. Anderson K.R. Xu Y.Y. Deeds J.D. Feeley R. Gimeno C.J. Woolf E.A. Tayber O. Mays G.G. Sampson B.A. Schoen F.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Falb D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9314-9319Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and in human dermal fibroblasts (this report). Also, the latter observations are not consistent with the recent demonstration that TGF-β may induce Smad7 expression in certain cell types (30von Gersdorff G. Susztak K. Rezvani F. Bitzer M. Liang D. Böttinger E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11320-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that is Smad3/4-dependent (30von Gersdorff G.

It appears therefore that the control of Smad7 expression by cytokines is cell-type specific. It should be noted that the lack of induction of Smad7 expression in human dermal fibroblasts occurred despite efficient NF-κB/RelA activation and subsequent nuclear translocation upon TNF-α treatment (31Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Kouba D.J. Chung K.Y. Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Klement J.F. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4226-4234PubMed Google Scholar) and despite rapid activation of Smad signaling and Smad-dependent transcription by TGF-β (our data and Refs. 27Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 28Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J.

These observations indicate that Smad7 gene regulation by either TNF-α or TGF-β requires mechanisms other than just RelA and/or Smad3 activation. In this report, we have demonstrated that TNF-α, via AP-1 activation, interferes with Smad signaling within the cell nucleus. First, we suggest the possibility of a direct Smad3 squelching mechanism, where Jun proteins bind Smad3 off-DNA and prevent its binding to specific DNA binding sites. In support of these findings, it has been shown that the interaction between Smad3 and JunB occurs between the MH1 domain of Smad3 and a 20-amino acid region close to the leucine-zipper domain of c-Jun and JunB (32Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 33Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Because the MH1 domain is also the DNA binding domain of Smad3, it may be speculated that off-DNA interactions with Jun proteins are not compatible with simultaneous DNA binding of Smad3, consistent with both our observations and deductions from the crystal structure of the MH1 domain of Smad3 (41Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Secondly, we have demonstrated that p300 overexpression overcomes the inhibitory effect of TNF-α/AP-1 on TGF-β/Smad3-specific transcription from the (SBE)4-Lux construct. These results were confirmed in a Gal4·Smad3 fusion protein assay system. A possible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of TNF-α/c-Jun would be that c-Jun sequesters p300, a known transcriptional co-activator for both Smads and Jun proteins (35Feng X.H. Zhang Y. Wu R.Y. Derynck R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 36Janknecht R. Wells N.J. Hunter T.

Cell. 1996; 85: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). Such sequestration of p300 by c-Jun likely reduces p300-Smad3 interactions and resulting Smad3-dependent transcription. A similar working model of competition for p300 has been proposed to explain the antagonistic effects of E1A and RelA on c-Jun- and Smad3-mediated transcription (13Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 43Lee J.S. See R.H. Deng T. Shi Y. Mol. Cell.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 527-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite the characterization of several Smad-responsive natural promoters in the literature, such as those for COL1A2,COL7A1 or PAI-1, we chose to focus our study on the artificial Smad-specific (SBE)4-Lux construct. The reasons for this choice are as follows. First, we have previously shown that the direct inhibitory effect of TNF-α on COL1A2 gene transcription is an NF-κB-dependent mechanism, through direct binding of RelA/NF-κB1 (p65·p50) complexes to a cis-element immediately adjacent to the COL1A2TGF-β response element (39Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). TNF-α may also exert an antagonistic activity against TGF-β effect on the COL1A2 promoter via c-Jun induction (18Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Uitto J. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3272-3278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), a phenomenon which may reflect c-Jun-mediated inhibition of the Smad3/4 pathway, the latter participating in COL1A2 gene transactivation (29Chen S.J. Yuan W. Mori Y. Levenson A. Trojanowska M. Varga J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, because of the direct inhibitory effect of NF-κB on COL1A2 promoter activity, the use of the latter as a tool to study the transcriptional outcome of Smad-AP-1 interactions specifically seemed inappropriate. Regarding the COL7A1 gene, we have shown that TNF-α and TGF-β synergistically activate its promoter via distinct Smad- and NF-κB-specific cis-elements (45Kon A. Vindevoghel L. Kouba D.J. Fujimura Y. Uitto J. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Somewhat similarly, the PAI-1 promoter, which contains at least three AP-1 sites distant from three CAGA boxes, is stimulated by both Smad- and AP-1 pathways (15Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of multiple cytokine-responsive elements within natural promoters known to be Smad-responsive prevented us from using them in this study, as additional non-Smad-dependent regulatory mechanisms would have participated in the outcome of the experiments. In conclusion, the present report establishes that the AP-1 pathway downstream of TNF-α directly interferes with TGF-β/Smad3 signaling at the level of Smad3-mediated gene transcription. Direct c-Jun/Smad3 or JunB/Smad3 interactions off-DNA may reduce the ability of available Smad3 to reach its DNA targets. Alternatively, Jun components may recruit the transcriptional co-activator p300, reducing its availability for Smad3. Both mechanisms likely contribute simultaneously to the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on TGF-β/Smad3 signaling. We thank Charlotte Tacheau for invaluable technical help.

S. typhimurium has recently been shown to synthesize itsS-2-hydroxymyristate-modified lipid A in a PhoP/PhoQ-dependent manner, suggesting a possible role for the 2-OH group in pathogenesis. We postulated that 2-hydroxylation might be catalyzed by a novel dioxygenase. Lipid A was extracted from a PhoP-constitutive mutant of S. typhimurium grown in the presence or absence of O2. Under anaerobic conditions, no 2-hydroxymyristate-containing lipid A was formed. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of lipid A from cells grown in the presence of 18O2confirmed the direct incorporation of molecular oxygen into 2-hydroxyacyl-modified lipid A. Using several well characterized dioxygenase protein sequences as probes, tBLASTn searches revealed unassigned open reading frame(s) with similarity to mammalian aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylases in bacteria known to make 2-hydroxyacylated lipid A molecules. The S. typhimuriumaspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase homologue (designatedlpxO) was cloned into pBluescriptSK and expressed inEscherichia coli K-12, which does not containlpxO. Analysis of the resulting construct revealed thatlpxO expression is sufficient to induce O2-dependent formation of 2-hydroxymyristate-modified lipid A in E. coli. LpxO very likely is a novel Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of lipid A (or of a key precursor). The S. typhimurium lpxO gene encodes a polypeptide of 302 amino acids with predicted membrane-anchoring sequences at both ends. We hypothesize that 2-hydroxymyristate chains released from lipopolysaccharide inside infected macrophages might be converted to 2-hydroxymyristoyl coenzyme A, a well characterized, potent inhibitor of protein N-myristoyl transferase.

In human hosts, S. typhimurium infection causes gastroenteritis, but in mice, the outcome is a fatal, typhoid-like sepsis, characterized by dissemination of bacteria into spleen, liver, and blood (1Jones B.D. Falkow S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). S. typhimurium initially invade intestinal epithelial cells and M cells of Peyer's patches and then pass into the lymphatic system by colonizing phagocytic cells (1Jones B.D. Falkow S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 533-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The bacteria survive and multiply within modified vacuoles of macrophages (2Garcia-Del Portillo F.

Swanson R.V. Haidaris C.G. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5189-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The low Mg2+concentration within phagolysosomes activates the PhoP/PhoQ two-component signal transduction system of S. typhimurium, triggering numerous responses needed for survival and persistence within macrophages (7Fields P.I. Groisman E.A. Heffron F. Science. 1989; 243: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator PhoP (8Groisman E.A. Chiao E. Lipps C.J. Heffron F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Soncini F.C. Groisman E.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The low pH of the phagolysosome, together with PhoP/PhoQ, also activates the PmrA/PmrB two-component system (10Groisman E.A. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The latter confers resistance to polymyxin and to many cationic antibacterial peptides (11Groisman E.A. Kayser J. Soncini F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7040-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is the principal constituent of the outer leaflet of the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria (12Raetz C.R.H.

Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Lipid A, the hydrophobic membrane anchor of LPS (Fig. 1), triggers most of these responses (13Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

The acylated glucosamine disaccharide backbone of lipid A (Fig. 1 A) is highly conserved in diverse Gram-negative bacteria (12Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Although previously thought to be a relatively static structure, recent studies of S. typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have demonstrated that lipid A may be modified in a PhoP/PhoQ-dependent manner under conditions that mimic the phagolysosomal environment (22Guo L.

Miller S.I. Science. 1999; 286: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). A palmitate group can be added in acyloxyacyl linkage to the R-3-hydroxymyristate residue at position 2 on S. typhimurium lipid A, and the amount ofS-2-hydroxymyristate at position 3′ can be greatly increased (Fig. 1 B) (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose (l-Ara4N) and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) groups may be attached to the 4′- and/or 1-phosphates (Fig. 1 B) once the PmrA/PmrB system is activated (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). While not required for bacterial growth in culture, these modifications may facilitate host-pathogen interactions. For instance, S. typhimurium mutants that are defective in the PhoP/Q-activated gene pagP do not incorporate the palmitate moiety into their lipid A and are more susceptible to the NP-1 defensin (24Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Strains that cannot make l-Ara4N are unable to acquire resistance to polymyxin (25Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coliK-12, modification of lipid A with l-Ara4N, pEtN, and/or palmitate is seen in polymyxin-resistant mutants (26Nummila K. Kilpelainen I. Zähringer U. Vaara M. Helander I.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or in wild type cells treated with metavanadate (27Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but 2-hydroxymyristate is not made (28Bryn K. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 86: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The stimulation of S-2-hydroxymyristate biosynthesis at low Mg2+ concentrations and its absence in PhoP null mutants suggest a function for 2-hydroxylation in pathogenesis (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 29Ernst R.K. Guina T. Miller S.I. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Although 2-hydroxy fatty acids have been used as taxonomic markers (28Bryn K. Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 86: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,30Welch D.F. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 422-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), the enzymatic pathway for the biosynthesis of theS-2-hydroxymyristate moiety in lipid A of S. typhimurium and other organisms is unknown. Early studies of hydroxyacyl composition, conducted prior to the elucidation of the covalent structure and biosynthesis of lipid A, suggested that the 2-OH (but not the 3-OH) groups of Pseudomonas might be derived from O2 (31Humphreys G.O. Hancock I.C. Meadow P.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1972; 71: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Kawahara K. Uchida K. Aida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).We now show that the presence of the 2-hydroxymyristate residue inS. typhimurium lipid A is O2-dependent and that18O2 is directly incorporated into 2-hydroxymyristate-containing lipid A. We also report the discovery, cloning, and heterologous expression of a novel gene from S. typhimurium, designated lpxO, encoding a 302-amino acid polypeptide with significant sequence similarity to mammalian aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase, an Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (33Jia S. VanDusen W.J. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Dixon R.A. Elliston K.O. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14322-14327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jia S. McGinnis K.

LpxO shares more subtle structural features with other Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, including deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus (35Vålegard K. van Scheltinga A.C. Lloyd M.D. Hara T. Ramaswamy S. Perrakis A. Thompson A. Lee H.J. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Hajdu J. Andersson I. Nature. 1998; 394: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of S. typhimurium lpxO in E. coli K-12, which does not contain the gene, results in the aerobic biosynthesis of 2-hydroxymyristate-modified lipid A. The lpxO gene is highly homologous to a family of bacterial genes that may be responsible for the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxy fatty acids found in lipid A molecules of certain other Gram-negative pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumonia,P. aeruginosa, Bordetella pertussis,Legionella pneumophila, and all types ofSalmonella. The release of 2-hydroxyacyl chains from lipid A within phagolysosomes, known to be catalyzed by mammalian acyloxyacyl hydrolase (36Erwin A.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16444-16449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), might allow animal cells to synthesize 2-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A species, some of which are very potent inhibitors of protein N-myristoylation (37Paige L.A. Zheng G.Q. DeFrees S.A. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10566-10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONAlthough 2-hydroxy fatty acids have long been recognized as components of lipid A molecules in a select subset of Gram-negative bacteria (28Bryn K.

Uchida K. Aida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The recent discovery that formation of the 2-hydroxymyristate moiety in S. typhimurium lipid A is under the control of the PhoP/PhoQ two-component regulatory system raises the intriguing possibility that this substituent might play a role in pathogenesis (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Although other lipid A modifying groups, such asl-Ara4N, pEtN, and C16:0 moieties, are similarly regulated (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and are common to both E. coli and S. typhimurium (27Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the 2-hydroxymyristate substituent is seen only in S. typhimurium. Mutants defective in PhoP/PhoQ do not make any of these substituents (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Such strains are much less virulent than wild type and are susceptible to cationic anti-microbial peptides (24Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 25Gunn J.S. Lim K.B. Krueger J. Kim K. Guo L. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1171-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The biological functions of each of the lipid A modifying groups are difficult to assess, however, because the enzymes that catalyze their formation have not yet been identified.We have now established that the formation of the 2-hydroxymyristate moiety in S. typhimurium lipid A is oxygen-dependent, as is the case for 2-hydroxylaurate inP. ovalis (32Kawahara K. Uchida K. Aida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 572: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When S. typhimurium cells are grown under anaerobic conditions, myristate is incorporated into lipid A in place of 2-hydroxymyristate. The 2-hydroxymyristate residue is probably generated by hydroxylation of the myristate chain after its incorporation into nascent lipid A by MsbB (13Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar, 59Clementz T. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, we cannot yet exclude the alternative possibility that 2-hydroxymyristate is formed while still attached to acyl carrier protein,i.e. by hydroxylation of myristoyl-acyl carrier protein. Development of an in vitro assay should resolve this question.We used a bioinformatic approach to identify the putative hydroxylase responsible for the formation of the 2-hydroxymyristoyl moiety ofS. typhimurium lipid A. We first probed all of the available microbial genomic data bases for uncharacterized open reading frames with sequence similarity to well characterized, cloned dioxygenases, such as selected P450-, dinuclear iron-, and Fe2+/α-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases. Those dioxygenases with homologues in bacteria known to make 2-hydroxyacylated lipid A species were considered further. Of the various dioxygenases used to search the microbial data bases, only the mammalian aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase yielded the desired pattern. This enzyme hydroxylates certain aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in clotting factors and other proteins (60Gronke R.S. VanDusen W.J. Garsky V.M. Jacobs J.W. Sardana M.K. Stern A.M. Friedman P.A.

Of these, His155 of the S. typhimurium LpxO is of special interest, since it corresponds to His675 of bovine aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase (Fig.5), a residue identified by site-directed mutagenesis to be critical for iron binding and catalysis (34Jia S.

Its presence in S. typhimurium LpxO was recognized by visual inspection. This motif is well characterized in the crystal structure of deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase, in which the two His residues and one Asp residue of the motif function as iron ligands (35Vålegard K. van Scheltinga A.C.

The crystal structure of the bovine aspartyl/asparaginyl β-hydroxylase itself has not yet been solved.The ability of the S. typhimurium lpxO gene to enable the biosynthesis of 2-hydroxymyristate-modified lipid A in E. coli (Figs. 7 and 8) strongly suggests that lpxO is the structural gene for a novel membrane bound, α-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase. The LpxO active site may face the cytoplasm. However, in view of the ability ofS. typhimurium to secrete large amounts of α-ketoglutarate (>100 μm) into the medium under conditions of iron stress, the possibility of a periplasmic or outer membrane localization for LpxO cannot be excluded (65Reissbrodt R.

It is interesting that no S. typhimurium genes expressed in vivo have been mapped to minute 92.8. Furthermore, despite the dependence of 2-hydroxymyristate biosynthesis on the PhoP/Q system (22Guo L. Lim K.B. Gunn J.S. Bainbridge B. Darveau R.P. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Science. 1997; 276: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), no genes mapping to lpxO have been found in searches for PhoP/Q-regulated genes (70Belden W.J. Miller S.I. Infect.

It may be that these genetic screens were not fully saturated.Despite the important roles that lipid A plays in host cell signaling and the fact that modified lipid A structures can elicit different host responses (13Raetz C.R.H.

We propose a “Trojan horse” hypothesis for 2-hydroxymyristate function during S. typhimurium infections (Fig. 9). Neutrophils and monocytes are known to deacylate purified LPS (72Munford R.S.

The relevant acyloxyacyl hydrolase has been well characterized and is thought to detoxify LPS from diverse Gram-negative bacteria (36Erwin A.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol.

During S. typhimurium infections, acyloxyacyl hydrolase would be expected to release 2-hydroxymyristate from LPS, which might allow mammalian cells to synthesize 2-hydroxymyristoyl coenzyme A, a potent inhibitor (K i ∼ 40 nm) of myristoyl-coenzyme A/protein N-myristoyltransferase (37Paige L.A.

https://openalex.org/W1993088007,"In a previous study, we reported that theSaccharomyces cerevisiae gene YPC1 encodes an alkaline ceramidase with a dual activity, catalyzing both hydrolysis and synthesis of yeast ceramide (Mao, C., Xu, R., Bielawska, A., and Obeid, L. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 6876–6884). In this study, we have identified a YPC1homologue in S. cerevisiae that also encodes an alkaline ceramidase. We show that these two ceramidases have different substrate specificity, such that YPC1p preferentially hydrolyzes phytoceramide, whereas the new ceramidase YDC1p hydrolyzes dihydroceramide preferentially and phytoceramide only slightly. Neither enzyme hydrolyzes unsaturated mammalian-type ceramide. In contrast to YPC1p, YDC1p had only minor in vitro reverse activity of catalyzing dihydroceramide formation from a free fatty acid and dihydrosphingosine and no activity with phytosphingosine. Overexpression of YDC1p had no reverse activity in non-stressed yeast cells, but like YPC1p suppressed the inhibition of growth by fumonisin B1 albeit more modestly. Deletion of YDC1 andYPC1 or both did not apparently affect growth, suggesting neither gene is essential. However, the Δydc1 deletion mutant but not the Δypc1 deletion mutant was sensitive to heat stress, indicating a role for dihydroceramide but not phytoceramide in heat stress responses, and suggesting that the two enzymes have distinct physiological functions.

Ceramide can also be generated from sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase or be glycosylated to yield more complex glycosphingolipids. Ceramide is also broken down by ceramidases to generate sphingosine and a fatty acid. Metabolism of yeast ceramides appears to be similar to that of mammals (4Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Phytoceramide, an equivalent of the mammalian ceramide, serves as a building block of yeast complex sphingolipids. It is synthesizedde novo from a fatty acyl-CoA and phytosphingosine by (a CoA-dependent) ceramide synthase. Phytosphingosine is generated from dihydrosphingosine through hydroxylation by the action of dihydrosphingosine hydroxylase (5Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol.

Dihydrosphingosine is also acylated by a fatty acyl-CoA to generate dihydroceramide through the action of ceramide synthase. Phytoceramide (or dihydroceramide) accepts an inositol-phosphoryl group to yield inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC). Ceramide, as the building block of complex sphingolipids in eukaryotic cells, not only is structurally essential for cell growth but also is important in modulating different cellular events including apoptosis, growth arrest, and stress responses (see reviews Refs. 2Merrill Jr., A.H. Schmelz E.M. Dillehay D.L. Spiegel S. Shayman J.A. Schroeder J.J. Riley R.T. Voss K.A. Wang E. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 142: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and 7Hannun Y.A.

Importantly, its breakdown product sphingosine and the subsequent metabolite sphingosine-1-P are also signaling molecules (11Spiegel S. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Kohama T. Menzeleev R. Olah Z.

As a signaling molecule or a donor of signaling molecules, ceramide must be tightly regulated in order to carry out multiple functions in cells. Indeed, levels of ceramide in cells change in response to different physiological environments or to different stimuli including growth factors, cytokines (12Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), heat (4Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Oncol. 1999; 15: 541-546PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in ceramide levels in cells involve different enzymes. Among these enzymes ceramidases are critical in controlling levels of ceramide in mammalian cells. Several mammalian ceramidases have been purified, characterized biochemically, and subsequently cloned (15Koch J. Gartner S. Li C.M. Quintern L.E. Bernardo K. Levran O. Schnabel D. Desnick R.J.

The acid ceramidase is localized to the lysosomes, and it is believed to be responsible mainly for housekeeping catabolism of membrane ceramide. Other membrane-bound ceramidases, which are considered as neutral- or alkaline-type enzymes, are believed to be in involved in signaling processes. For example, it was shown that mammalian alkaline ceramidase is activated by platelet-derived growth factor (12Coroneos E. Martinez M. McKenna S. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23305-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and that both alkaline and neutral ceramidases are activated by interleukin 1β at a low concentration through tyrosine phosphorylation (18Nikolova-Karakashian M.

We recently cloned an alkaline ceramidase YPC1p fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). YPC1p preferentially deacylated phytoceramide to yield a free fatty acid and phytosphingosine. It also slightly deacylated dihydroceramide to generate a free fatty acid and dihydrosphingosine, but it did not act on unsaturated ceramide. Importantly, this alkaline ceramidase had a reverse activity of catalyzing formation of phytoceramide from a free fatty acid and phytosphingosine in vitro and in cells. Formation of phytoceramide by the reverse activity of YPC1p appears to be an important alternative pathway for the synthesis of phytoceramide when the CoA-dependent ceramide synthase is inhibited inS. cerevisiae. Identification of YPC1p suggests that breakdown of ceramides is conserved between yeast and mammals. Another alkaline ceramidase was recently cloned fromPseudomonas and mycobacterium (20Okino N. Ichinose S. Omori A. Imayama S. Nakamura T. Ito M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36616-36622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This enzyme also had reverse activity but had no sequence homology to the yeast enzyme YPC1p, indicating they belong to different classes of ceramidases. In fact there was no homologous yeast sequence to thePseudomonas ceramidase. Interestingly thePseudomonas alkaline ceramidase shared a similarity in protein sequence and many biochemical properties with the mouse neutral ceramidase, which was recently purified and cloned from mouse liver (16Tani M.

Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27948-27955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a search of protein data bases for homology to YPC1p identified that another yeast putative protein encoded by the open reading frame YPL087w has 53% identity to YPC1p. In this report, we present evidence that this protein (YDC1p) is another membrane-bound alkaline ceramidase, with specific activity toward dihydroceramide. We demonstrate that this protein also has reverse activity albeit significantly less than that of YPC1p. We also show that the deletion mutant of YDC1 , but not YPC1, endows sensitivity to heat stress. These data suggest that the breakdown of phytoceramide and dihydroceramide in S. cerevisiae is catalyzed by different enzymes that have different physiologic functions.

A copy of the wild type YDC1 gene in the diploid strain JK9-3d a/α was replaced by a disruption module consisting of the Kluyveromyces lactis URA3 gene (Research Genetics, Inc.) flanked by the 5′ end (nucleotide 16–46) and 3′ end (nucleotide 892–926) portions of the YDC1 coding region. Briefly, the disruption module amplified by PCR was transformed into diploid cells by a lithium acetate method. The diploid cells containing the ydc1 disruption module (deletion allele) were sporulated, and the resulting tetrads were dissected as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All 10 tetrads dissected gave 4 viable spores, indicating that theYDC1 gene is not essential for viability of the yeast. The haploid strain (Δydc1) harboring theydc1 deletion allele was selected by prototrophs for uracil, and deletion of YDC1 was verified by PCR using a forward primer (5′ CAAGAATTTAAGCAAAAGGATATATCATAGAACCTAGTG 3′) upstream of the YDC1 coding region and the reverse primer (the K. lactis internal 3′ primer (Research Genetics, Inc.)) located in the middle of the URA3 gene. By using these two primers, the PCR would yield a product if the disruption module is correctly integrated into the chromosome and replaces theYDC1 gene. Diploid strain harboring both ypc1 andydc1 deletion alleles was created by crossing the two haploid strains Δydc1 andΔypc1. Sporulation and tetrad dissection of the diploid strain yielded 4 normal spores, indicating that double deletions of both YPC1 and YDC1 are viable. The haploid strain harboring deletion of both ydc1 andypc1 was selected by geneticin resistance followed by prototrophs for uracil. Since the URA3 gene interferes with heat stress study, the wild type URA3 gene which replaced the wild type YDC1 allele in bothΔydc1 andΔypc1Δydc1 strains was replaced by a truncated URA3 mutant that lacks the BbrP1(restriction enzyme) fragment. Replacement of the wild typeURA3 gene was counter-selected by 5-fluoroorotic acid and was verified by PCR. The open reading frame of the gene YDC1 was amplified by PCR (1 cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min) using the precision plus Taq polymerase (Stratagene, Inc.) and the primers 5′ CGGGGTACCATGCTGTTCAGCTGGCCTTATCCAG 3′ (forward) and 5′ CGGGAATTCTTAGTTATTCTTTTTTGTTTCATCATCTACC 3′ (reverse). These primers contain the restriction sites (underlined)KpnI and EcoRI, respectively, for the cloning purposes. The amplified product was digested by restriction enzymesKpnI and EcoRI and cloned into theKpnI and EcoRI sites of the vector pYES2 to yield the construct pYES2-YPC1, thus expressing YDC1p under control of the promoter Gal1. To facilitate detecting and purifying YDC1p, the coding region of the gene YDC1 was tagged with the sequence (underlined) encoding the FLAG epitope peptide by PCR using the forward primer 5′ CGGGGTACCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGATAAGCTGTTCAGCTGGCCTTATCCAG 3′ and the reverse primer 5′ CGGGAATTCTTAGTTATTCTTTTTTGTTTCATCATCTACC 3′ as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The PCR product was digested withKpnI and EcoRI and cloned into the vector pYES2 as described above. The resulting construct pYES2/YDC1-FLAG that expresses the FLAG-tagged protein YDC1p under the control of the promoter Gal1, the construct pYES2-YPC1, and the empty vector pYES2 were introduced into the strain Δyor1 by the lithium acetate method after correctness of these constructs was ensured by sequencing. The strain containing pYES2, pYES2-YPC1, or pYES2/YDC1-FLAG was grown and maintained in SC-ura medium with 2% glucose. Expression of YDC1p or the tagged YDC1p (YDC1p-FLAG) was induced in SC-ura medium with 2% galactose, and YDC1p-FLAG was detected by Western analysis using a monoclonal antibody against FLAG peptide as described. Microsomes were prepared from the cells expressing YDC1p-FLAG as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Proteins were solubilized from the microsomes with 0.25% Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mmCaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 μg/ml CLAP), and YDC1p-FLAG was purified by an anti-FLAG affinity column (Sigma) as recommended by the manufacturer. The YPC1and YDC1 coding sequences without the stop codon were amplified from the yeast genomic DNA and cloned into the GFPuv-containing vector pYES2-GFPuv in frame with the GFPuv coding sequence. The constructs pYES2-YPC1-GFPuv and pYES2-YDC1-GFPuv that express the YPC1-GFPuv and YDC1-GFPuv fusion proteins, respectively, were introduced into the yeast strain JK9-3d. Expression of the YPC1-GFPuv and YDC1-GFPuv fusion proteins was induced in the SC-ura medium containing 2% galactose for 6–12 h and was detected by Western blot analysis using the anti-GFP antibody. The fluorescence of the yeast cells was examined under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope and recorded by a CCD camera. The coding sequence of the gene YDC1 was excised by restriction enzymes KpnI and EcoRI from the plasmid pYES2-YDC1 and cloned intoKpnI and EcoRI sites of the vector pBAD/His B (Invitrogen) that was digested by the same enzymes to create pBAD/His-YDC1, thus expressing the polyhistidine (His) and Xpress tagged YDC1p under control of the araBAD promoter (P BAD). pBAD/His and pBAD/His-YDC1 were introduced into the E. coli strain TOP10 by electroporation. The tagged YDC1p was expressed and purified as described (23Mao C. Wadleigh M. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

[3H]Ceramide and phytoceramide were synthesized as follows:N-[9,10-3H]d-erythro-C16-ceramide andN-[9,10-3H]d-ribo-C16-phytoceramide were prepared by acylation of the respective sphingoid bases with [9,10-3H]palmitoyl chloride generated in situfrom [9,10-3H]palmitic acid as described (24Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 499-518Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar).d-Erythrosphingosine was obtained in stereo- and enantio-specific synthesis as described previously (25Bielawska A. Szulc Z. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 311: 518-547Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Phytosphingosine was from Sigma. N-Hexanoyl-d-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine ([3H]C6-dihydroceramide),d-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine, andd-erythro-[4,5-3H]dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (ARC, Inc.). Ceramidase activity was measured using [3H]ceramide (2.75 nmol), [3H]phytoceramide (2.5 nmol), or [3H]C6-dihydroceramide (2 nmol) as a substrate as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To measure ceramidase activity, 20 μl (approximately 150 μg of proteins) of microsomes or a purified protein was added to substrates, and reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 40–90 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 300 μl of methanol:chloroform (2:1) and dried under a SpeedVac. Lipids were resolved by TLC; the reaction product palmitic acid or dihydrosphingosine was identified, scraped, and measured by a scintillation counter. Both the protein concentration and the time of incubation were within the linear range for the assay. One unit of ceramidase was defined as the amount of the enzyme needed to release 1 pmol of palmitic acid or dihydrosphingosine per min. The reverse activity of ceramidase was measured using [3H]palmitic acid (0.3 nmol) and phytosphingosine (or dihydrosphingosine) (5 nmol) as substrates as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Microsomes were added to the above substrates and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Both protein concentration and time of incubation were within the linear range for the assay. Phospholipid determination on microsomes showed that different microsomal preparations with equal amount of proteins contained equal amount of lipids. One unit of the reverse activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme needed to form 1 pmol of phytoceramide (or dihydroceramide) per min. Cells (3 × 107 in 1 ml of medium) were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid or [3H]C6-dihydroceramide (5–10 μCi) at 30 °C for different periods as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Total lipids were extracted, deacylated by monomethylamine (20% in ethanol), and resolved by TLC using the solvent system II (chloroform, methanol, 4.2n ammonium hydroxide, 9:7:2, v/v) as described (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). TLC plates were sprayed with EN3HANCE and radiographed on BioMax films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Radiolabeled sphingolipids were identified according to authentic standards. To quantify an individual lipid, the radioactive bands were scraped and counted by a scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and were detected by Coomassie staining or Western blotting analysis by following standard procedures. Exponentially growing cells of yeast strains were incubated at 50 °C for 40 min. The heat-treated cells and those set at room temperature were plated onto YPD plates and incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. The plates were photographed and colony-forming units (CFU) were determined. The post-heat stress viability was defined as a percentage of post-heat stress CFU to those prior to heat stress. To find potential homologues for the YPC1 gene, we searched theSaccharomyces Genome Database. We identified a putative protein, encoded by the open reading frame YPL087w, that had 52% identity to the yeast alkaline ceramidase YPC1p over the entire protein sequence. This protein had 317 amino acids, with a predicted pI of 6.77. Several highly conserved regions were found between the two proteins (Fig. 1 A). Similar to YPC1p, the homologue was a very hydrophobic protein and shared a similar hydropathy profile with YPC1p (Fig. 1 B). Both proteins were predicted to have several transmembrane domains (Fig.1 C), suggesting that this homologue is also an integral membrane protein. Both proteins had an ER retention sequence (KKXX, X represents any amino acid residue) at their carboxyl termini, suggesting that they may be localized to the ER. Based on similarities of protein sequence and hydropathy profiles, this protein was predicted to be another ceramidase. To investigate whether the homologous gene encodes for a ceramidase activity, we cloned its coding sequence into the vector pYES2 under the control of the Gal1 inducible promoter. Sequencing confirmed that the coding region was identical to that reported in the yeast genomic data base. The vector pYES2 and the new construct were transformed into the yeast strain Δyor1, and gene expression was induced by galactose. Microsomes were prepared and assayed for ceramidase activity using different ceramides as substrates. Interestingly overexpression of the homologous protein caused a substantial increase in ceramidase activity toward C6-dihydroceramide (Fig.2 A), but only a slight increase in the activity toward phytoceramide (Fig. 2 B), and no activity toward unsaturated ceramide (Fig. 2 C). In contrast to the homologue, microsomes from cells overexpressing YPC1p hydrolyzed phytoceramide preferentially over dihydroceramide (Fig. 2,A and B). These data suggest that this homologue also encodes for a ceramidase activity; however, it had different substrate specificity. We thus renamed this gene YDC1 asyeast dihydroceramidase. We demonstrated above that YDC1p encodes a ceramidase activity mainly hydrolyzing dihydroceramide. However, we have not ruled out the possibility that YDC1p is a regulator of ceramidase activity. To verify that YDC1p is itself a ceramidase, we went on to express the YDC1p inE. coli. To facilitate detection and purification, we tagged the YDC1p with a polyhistidine (His) tag. The His-tagged YDC1p was expressed in E. coli as analyzed by Western blot (data not shown). The His-tagged YDC1p did not have ceramidase activity, probably due to a post-translational modification required for the activity thatE. coli lacks. Therefore, we elected to express the YDC1p in yeast cells. To facilitate purifying the YDC1p, we tagged it with an epitope tag FLAG. Expression of the tagged YDC1p was induced by galactose after the expressing construct pYES2-YDC1-FLAG was introduced into yeast cells. Microsomes were prepared from the cells expressing YDC1-FLAG or containing the empty vector pYES2-FLAG. Proteins were extracted from microsomes with 0.25% Triton X-100 and applied to an anti-FLAG affinity column. After washing, the FLAG-tagged protein was eluted by a buffer containing FLAG peptide (10 μg/ml). The eluates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected by Coomassie staining (Fig. 3 A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 B) using the anti-FLAG antibody. A protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa and a cluster of protein bands with apparent molecular mass ranging from 75 to 200 kDa were revealed by Coomassie staining as well as by Western blotting in the YDC1-FLAG eluate but not in the vector control eluate. The eluates were assayed for ceramidase activity. Fig. 3 Cshows that the purified FLAG-tagged YDC1p, but not the vector control eluate, had ceramidase activity toward C6-dihydroceramide. The high molecular weight protein cluster could be aggregated YDC1-FLAG since it is a very hydrophobic protein. Alternatively, it could be YDC1-FLAG associated complexes. However, since YDC1p is highly homologous to the alkaline ceramidase YPC1p, and purified YDC1p had ceramidase activity toward C6-dihydroceramide, it is most likely that the YDC1 gene encodes a ceramidase and less likely that it is a regulator of enzymatic activity. In our previous study, we demonstrated that YPC1p is an alkaline ceramidase, with an optimal pH of 9.5 (19Mao C. Xu R. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6876-6884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To study whether YDC1p has the same or a different pH optimum, we measured the ceramidase activity of microsomal preparations from cells overexpressing YDC1p using C6-dihydroceramide as a substrate at different pH. Fig. 4 shows that YDC1p has very low activity at acidic pH, moderate activity at neutral pH, and the highest activity at alkaline pH. These data suggest that similar to YPC1p, YDCp also belongs to the alkaline ceramidase family. In vitroYDC1p showed ceramidase activity. We next wanted to know whether in cells YDC1p has the same ceramidase activity. Ceramidase activity in cells was evaluated using [3H]C6-dihydroceramide labeled at the C-4 and C-5 positions of the dihydrosphingosine moiety. Similar to YPC1p, overexpression of YDC1p enhanced breakdown of [3H]C6-dihydroc"

On average, the region has been in balance, but with thickening of 21 centimeters per year in the southwest and thinning of 30 centimeters per year in the southeast. The north of the ice sheet shows less variability, with average thickening of 2 centimeters per year in the northeast and thinning of about 5 centimeters per year in the northwest. These results agree well with those from repeated altimeter surveys, except in the extreme south, where we find substantially higher rates of both thickening and thinning."

Although not essential for viral replication in tissue culture, the latter four proteins are highly conserved and likely exert important but less well understood functions in vivo that contribute to viral pathogenesis. Vpr, a ∼14-kDa, 96-amino acid protein, is conserved among the primate lentiviruses HIV-1, HIV-2, and the simian immunodeficiency virus, supporting the notion that it plays an important role in the viral life cycle in vivo. Indeed, deletion of vpr and the related vpx genes in simian immunodeficiency virus severely compromises the pathogenic properties in experimentally infected rhesus macaques (1Lang S.M. Weeger M.

Unlike most animal retroviruses, the primate lentiviruses are able to replicate efficiently in non-dividing cells. Although not essential for viral replication in T cells,in vitro Vpr significantly augments viral replication in terminally differentiated monocytes/macrophages, a function that probably relates to its karyophilic property (3Heinzinger N.K. Bukrinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.-A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This import may similarly involve the function of other karyophilic viral proteins including the p17gag matrix and integrase proteins (reviewed in Refs. 8Bukrinsky M. Adzhubei A. Rev. Med.

Vpr also induces G2 cell cycle arrest in infected proliferating human T cells (reviewed in Refs. 8Bukrinsky M. Adzhubei A. Rev. Med.

The importance of these latter functions for maintenance of the HIV replicative life cycle and the induction of disease in the infected host remains uncertain. The participation of Vpr in HIV-1 replication suggests that selective interruption of Vpr function with small molecule inhibitors might yield a new class of antiviral agents. However, the design of effective Vpr antagonists requires more detailed knowledge of its molecular structure, function, and mode of action. The availability of essentially unlimited quantities of pure and biologically active Vpr could certainly accelerate progress in understanding its biological functions and propel the development of effective antagonists. Recombinant Vpr has been produced in insect cells and as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli(15Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At concentrations as low as 100 pg/ml, the extracellular addition of recombinant Vpr activates HIV-1 replication in both leukemic cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (23Levy D.N.

However, when maintained at high concentrations as required for structural investigation, preparations of recombinant Vpr often undergo spontaneous aggregation. In addition, a cytotoxic effect of the protein in both pro- and eukaryotic cells (25Macreadie I.G. Castelli L.A. Hewish D.R. Kirkpatrick A. Ward A.C. Azad A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We now describe the production of synthetic Vpr (sVpr), its purification to homogeneity, and the characterization of this synthetic protein by N-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry (MS), and gel electrophoresis. In addition, we report the behavior of sVpr in aqueous solution under various conditions as analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), CD, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Finally, we demonstrate that sVpr is efficiently taken up by human macrophages and HeLa cells from the extracellular medium, is imported into the nucleus of such transduced cells, and induces G2 cell cycle arrest. Synthesis was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences MilliGen 9050 automated peptide synthesizer on a 0.09-mmol scale on a TentaGel R PHB Ser(t-butyl) Fmoc resin (capacity 0.19-mmol g−1) using the Fmoc/t-butyl strategy. The following side chain protecting groups were used: 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl (Arg),t-butoxycarbonyl (Trp and Lys), t-butyl ether (Thr, Ser, and Tyr), t-butyl ester (Asp and Glu), and trityl (Asn, Cys, Gln, and His). Couplings were performed withN-[1H-benzotriazol(1-yl)(dimethylamino)methylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexa-fluorophosphate-N-oxide (HBTU), except that 1-(1-pyrrolidinyl-1H-1,2,3-triazolo-[4,5-b-]-pyridin-1-ylmethylene)-pyrrolidinium hexa-fluorophosphate-N-oxide was used for the last 30 amino acids in order to increase the efficiency of the final part of the synthesis (27Carpino L.A.

Coupling was performed with 1 mmol Fmoc amino acids using HBTU in N-methylpyrrolidone as coupling agent with a cycle time of 45 min for single coupling and 75 min for double coupling applied for the last 56 amino acids. In order to avoid aspartimide formation, deprotection of the N-terminal Fmoc group was performed with piperidine/DMF/formic acid during the entire course of the synthesis. Deprotection of the Fmoc group was performed during the complete synthesis with 20% piperidine in DMF, containing 0.1m HCOOH to avoid aspartimide side reactions.

The manufacturer's procedure was modified as follows: 2 mg ofsVpr was dissolved in 1 ml of DMF; 1 vial of dye from the kit was added; and the pH was adjusted to 8.5–9.0 with diisopropylethylamine. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the reaction was diluted with water, and the pH was adjusted to 2.0. Labeled sVpr was purified on the resin supplied with the kit. For flow cytometry, sVpr was labeled with the fluorescent dye bis-1,1′-(4-sulfobutyl)indodicarbocyanine-5-carboxylic acid (sodium salt) that was coupled in the last step of the peptide synthesis to the N-terminal NH2 of sVpr by incubating the resin with the peptide in DMF with HBTU and diisopropylethylamine overnight. After completion, the resin was washed with DMF and methylene chloride, dried, and treated with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% triisopropylsilane, and 5% water. Trifluoroacetic acid was then removed under vacuum, and sVpr was precipitated with diethyl ether purified by a standard HPLC procedure. This procedure selectively labels the N-terminal residue, leaving other side chains of the peptide functional, and allows a relatively easy purification of the peptide while still attached to the resin. Similar to Cy3, this novel fluorescent dye absorbs at 550 nm and emits at 585 nm. Its detailed synthesis will be described elsewhere. ForsVpr, 30 sequencing steps were completed on an Applied Biosystems 473A pulsed liquid phase sequencer according to a standard protocol. Positive ion ESI mass spectra were recorded on a triple quad Finnigan TSQ 700 mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source. Protein samples were dissolved in 70% aqueous methanol and infused at a flow rate of 1 μl min−1 into the electrospray chamber with an ES needle voltage of 5.5 kV. The experimental spectrum showing multiply charged molecular ions with 8–13 positive charges was deconvoluted with standard software. MALDI/TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker reflex MALDI/TOF mass spectrometer using an N2 laser (337 nm). DLS was performed on a DynaPro-801 Molecular Sizing Instrument. Protein solutions (250 μl) prepared either in water or in 50% aqueous TFE at a concentration of ∼3.5 mg ml−1 (sVpr) or 4 mg ml−1 (Vpr47–96) were injected through 0.1-μm Whatman membrane filters. Samples were illuminated by a semiconductor laser (780 nm, 25 milliwatts) generated by a miniature solid state Ga1-yAlyAs diode. The photons scattered at a 90° angle by the particles in the sample were collected by an avalanche photodiode, and the time-dependent fluctuation in intensity of the scattered light was analyzed. The translational diffusion coefficientD T was calculated with the manufacturer's software (Dynamics, version 2.1). D T was then used to calculate the degree of sample polydispersity and the hydrodynamic radius of gyration R H of the particles using the Stokes-Einstein equation: (R H = (k b T)·(6πηD T)−1, where k b is Boltzman's constant;T is absolute temperature in Kelvin, and η = solvent viscosity. M r was calculated on a standard curve (M r versus R H) supplied by the manufacturer. Ten continuous measurements were made for each sample. CD spectra were recorded at room temperature in 0.5-mm cuvettes on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter in a wavelength range from 260 to 180 nm, and the resulting curves were smoothed with a high frequency filter. Samples of sVpr and Vpr47–96 were dissolved at a concentration of 0.2 mg ml−1 under various solution conditions (TFE concentration, pH). Secondary structure content was quantified with the program VARSELEC. Samples of the protein were dissolved in distilled water containing 10% D2O or containing 50% aqueous TFE-D2 by volume to give a final volume of 0.6 ml. Spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker Avance DMX 600 NMR spectrometer. The 1H spectra were referenced to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate or internally to the residual methylene signal of TFE at 3.95 ppm. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive spectra of 1H COSY (correlation spectroscopy), TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy), with mixing times of 110 ms, and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser and exchange spectroscopy), with mixing times of 250 ms, were recorded without spinning and processed with standard Bruker software. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum,R-96, was generated by immunization with sVpr. Immunoprecipitation of sVpr was carried out in Triton wash buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 60 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), pre-cleared with non-immune human and rabbit sera, followed by incubation with R-96 antibodies pre-loaded onto GammaBind-Plus-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with Triton wash buffer, once with SDS-DOC buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate), boiled for 10 min at 95 °C in sample buffer (2% SDS, 1% mercaptoethanol, 1% glycerol, 65 mmTris/HCl, pH 6.8), and subjected to electrophoresis on 16% Prosieve SDS-PAGE gels. Virus stocks were generated in HeLa cells transfected with pNL4-3 (29Adachi A. Gentleman H.E. König S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently used to infect MT 4 cells. Virions were pelleted from cell culture supernatant (30,000 ×g, 1.5 h, 4 °C) and purified on a sucrose cushion. For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon). Membranes were incubated with R-96, and binding of the antibodies was identified with 125I-labeled protein G. sVpr and Vpu32–81 were iodinated by the chloramine-T method. Briefly, ∼20 μg of peptides were reacted with 5.5 × 107 Bq (1.5 mCi) Na125I. Free iodine was removed by gel filtration through a Dowex ion exchange column saturated with bovine serum albumin. For studies on cellular uptake, rat yolk choriocarcinoma L2-RYC cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum to 75% confluence on 24-well plates. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and125I-labeled sVpr or, as a negative control,125I-labeled Vpu32–81. Radioactive peptides were added to the medium at a specific activity of 18 kBq ml−1. In parallel, cells were also treated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled sVpr or Vpu32–81. Cells were incubated for specified times at 37 °C, and the distribution of intra- and extracellular radioactivity was determined as described (30Moestrup S.K. Birn H. Fischer P.B. Petersen C.M. Verroust P.J. Sim R.B. Christensen E.I. Nexo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, medium was removed, and the cell layer was washed with PBS and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Radioactivity was determined in triplicate in the medium and cell layer. To correct for nonspecific binding of peptides to the cell surface, the cell layer radioactivity determined at time point 0 min (time when radiolabeled peptides were added to the medium for less than 30 s) was subtracted as background from the radioactivity detected in the cell layer. For cellular localization studies, either a suspension of HeLa cells (2 × 106 ml−1) or a confluent monolayer of human macrophages cultivated in chamber slides was incubated with fluorescent sVpr-488. After 48 h, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and mounted. The specimens were examined by epifluorescence or scanning confocal microscopy (model MRC-600; Bio-Rad). Macrophages were isolated from random HIV-1-seronegative healthy blood donors. First, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and grown in slide chambers, containing DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10% human serum AB (Gemini Bio-Products). After 1 week, cells were washed, and the adherent monolayer of monocyte-derived macrophages was used for import studies with sVpr. The number of cells transduced bysVpr-Cy3 was estimated by flow cytometry. HeLa cells were incubated withsVpr-Cy3 for 48 h, trypsinized, and fixed for 30 min in 2% formaldehyde followed by incubation with 1 mg ml−1 RNase A and 10 μg ml−1 propidium iodide in PBS for 30 min. Cellular DNA content in the fixed cells was then assessed with a FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed with the ModFit LT program (Becton Dickinson). Solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of full-length Vpr was performed with a sequence derived from the isolate HIV-1NL4–3 (Fig.1 A). HPLC profiles of the crude and purified protein products are shown in Fig. 1, Band C, respectively. In contrast to a recently described SPPS procedure for the synthesis of a Vpr protein derived from a different HIV-1 isolate (31Cornille F. Wecker K. Loffet A. Genet R. Roques B. J. Peptide Res. 1999; 54: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we optimized the procedure with respect to the use of coupling agents, protection groups, cleavage reagents, and duration of coupling reactions. Our protocol gave reproducibly high yields (usually 15%) of purified sVpr without encountering any of the previously reported (31Cornille F. Wecker K. Loffet A. Genet R. Roques B. J. Peptide Res. 1999; 54: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) synthesis problems such as incomplete coupling and deprotection, inter- and intrachain reaction with the resin matrix, hydrogen bond-mediated peptide aggregation, or side chain reactions. We also synthesized various fragments ofsVpr using the same SPPS protocol. The HPLC purification of the peptide Vpr47–96, comprising the C-terminal domain ofsVpr from positions Tyr-47 to Ser-96, is demonstrated in Fig. 1 G. The identity of purified sVpr was confirmed by sequencing of the N-terminal 30 amino acids. Positive ion ESI MS was used for molecular weight determination. The experimental data showed a well defined multiply charged spectrum (Fig. 1 D) that was deconvoluted to give an intense envelope for the molecular ion cluster at a molecular mass of 11,377.9 Da (Fig. 1 E), corresponding exactly with the molecular mass of 11,377.9 Da calculated for sVpr. In addition, the correct molecular mass ofsVpr was also established by MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry that showed an intense molecular ion cluster at 11,377.2 Da (not shown). In summary, the MS and sequence analyses indicated thatsVpr was homogenous and showed no detectable evidence of by-products. Similar results were also obtained for the C-terminal fragment Vpr47–96. The peptide was purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1 G), and the correct molecular mass of 5829.7 Da was established by ESI MS (Fig. 1 F). Molecular properties of sVpr were further characterized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Dilutions ofsVpr were separated and detected by Western blotting using Vpr-specific antibodies. For comparison with viral Vpr, lysates of purified HIV-1 particles were analyzed in parallel (Fig.2 A). In agreement with sequencing and MS data,sVpr migrated as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼14 kDa that was almost indistinguishable from the migration of viral Vpr. Western blot (Fig. 2 A) or direct silver staining of sVpr in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) did not detect peptide fragments that could have resulted from proteolysis or incomplete synthesis. In addition to monomeric Vpr, a small percentage of sVpr was detected in an M r range consistent with dimers and trimers. Such candidate oligomers were only detected at concentrations of ≥250 ng of sVpr per lane (Fig.2 A). The fact that sVpr forms oligomers (as shown below by DLS) is consistent with the previous demonstration of Vpr oligomers by chemical cross-linking (32Zhao L.J. Wang L. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32131-32137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These multiple forms were not observed with preparations of viral Vpr (Fig. 2 A). Two possibilities may explain these results. First, according to the detection of monomeric sVpr by Western blot, the highest amount of viral Vpr analyzed corresponded to ∼125 ng ofsVpr per lane; at this concentration multimers ofsVpr were not detected. Second, physical interactions between the C-terminal p6gag domain of the Pr55 Gag polyprotein (33Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Bachand F. Yao X.J. Hrimech M. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Biol.

Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1995; 9: 2759-2764Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, the presence of at least one of the known Vpr binding partners, p6gag, in the virus preparation may prevent homo-oligomerization of viral Vpr that was otherwise evident for isolated sVpr. Vpr contains a single cysteine at residue 76 that may potentially participate in intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Although disulfide-bridged dimers have not been reported for viral or recombinant Vpr, SDS-PAGE analysis of sVpr in the absence of reducing agents indicated that ∼10% of the molecules exist as disulfide-linked dimers, the formation of which was prevented by the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) (Fig. 2 B). sVpr was also used as an immunogen in rabbits to generate polyclonal anti-Vpr antibodies. The titer of the anti-Vpr antibody,R-96, was significantly increased when standard coupling ofsVpr to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was omitted indicating that the peptide presents a bona fide antigen. The resultantR96 antiserum reacts with Vpr proteins from several different HIV-1 isolates and binds to both virus-derived Vpr andsVpr with comparable efficiency. Furthermore, usingR96 for immunoprecipitation sVpr was detected at concentrations as low as 10 ng ml−1 diluted in human serum (Fig. 2 C). Together, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of R96 for detection of viral Vpr in serum samples of HIV-infected individuals (23Levy D.N. Refaeli Y. MacGregor R.R. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10873-10877Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Our SDS-PAGE results (Fig. 2,A and B) and the previously published cross-linking data (32Zhao L.J. Wang L. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32131-32137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that Vpr tends to form oligomeric structures. To study the oligomerization of sVpr in its dynamic state in solution, as opposed to the artificial fixation of particular folding states by chemical cross-linking, we used DLS to examine sVpr under various solution conditions. In pure water at a concentration of ∼3.5 mg ml−1 and without pH adjustment (pH ∼3.0), deconvolution of the primary DLS data indicates the existence of at least two components withR H values of ∼4.8 and 26.2 nm (with relative abundance of 99 and 1%) corresponding to complexes with molecular masses of 128 and 8075 kDa, respectively. Thus, in aqueous solution,sVpr existed as high order aggregates (∼decamers) with a lower percentage of higher multimers. Such oligomers of sVpr cannot be resolved by SDS-PAGE and may not be stabilized by cross-linking as demonstrated before (32Zhao L.J. Wang L. Mukherjee S. Narayan O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32131-32137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the majority ofsVpr exists in high M r aggregates, we observed no precipitation of the peptide, even at the relatively high mm concentration range investigated. Next we tested whether oligomers of sVpr could be reduced by an organic solvent such as TFE, which favors intramolecular interactions and suppresses hydrophobic intermolecular interactions that were implied to drive Vpr clustering (36Schüler W. Wecker K. de Rocquigny H. Baudat Y. Sire J. Roques B"

Homologous proteins, called RadA, have been described for Archaea. Here we present the characterization of two RecA/Rad51 family proteins, RadA and RadB, fromPyrococcus furiosus. The radA andradB genes were not induced by DNA damage resulting from exposure of the cells to γ and UV irradiation and heat shock, suggesting that they might be constitutively expressed in this hyperthermophile. RadA had DNA-dependent ATPase, D-loop formation, and strand exchange activities. In contrast, RadB had a very weak ATPase activity that is not stimulated by DNA. This protein had a strong binding affinity for DNA, but little strand exchange activity could be detected. A direct interaction between RadA and RadB was detected by an immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, RadB, but not RadA, coprecipitated with Hjc, a Holliday junction resolvase found inP. furiosus, in the absence of ATP. This interaction was suppressed in the presence of ATP. The Holliday junction cleavage activity of Hjc was inhibited by RadB in the absence, but not in the presence, of ATP. These results suggest that RadB has important roles in homologous recombination in Archaea and may regulate the cleavage reactions of the branch-structured DNA.

Homologous DNA recombination involves multistep reactions. The molecular mechanisms of the early stage include pairing and strand exchange reactions of two homologous DNA strands. The RecA/Rad51 family proteins have a central role in the initiation step by binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA),1 which results in the formation of a helical nucleoprotein filament (reviewed in Refs. 1Kowalczykowski S.C.

The amino acid sequences of archaeal RadAs are much more similar to those of eukaryotic Rad51 homologs than to those of bacterial RecA homologs. Preliminary characterization shows that the archaeal RadAs found inSulfolobus solfataricus, Desulfurococcus amylolyticus, and Pyrobaculum islandicum are functionally similar to the RecA/Rad51 family proteins found in the other domains (11Woods W.G.

To understand the detailed mechanism of the DNA recombination inArchaea, we have been investigating the proteins related to this process from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus (15Fiala G. Stetter K.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 56-61Crossref Scopus (715) Google Scholar). We identified a Rad51-like protein that is encoded in an operon that includes a novel heterodimeric DNA polymerase (polymerase II or D) and an Orc1 (originrecognition complex protein 1)-like protein (9Sandler S.J. Hugenholtz P. Schleper C. DeLong E.F. Pace N.R. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When we first reported this operon, we called the Rad51-like protein RadA. However, a subsequent report identified two Rad51/Dmc1 homologs in the P. furiosus genome, namely RadA and RadB (16DiRuggiero J. Robb F.T. Le Gal Y. Halvorson H. New Developments in Marine Bio/Technology. Plenum Press, New York1998: 193-196Google Scholar). The protein in the operon described above was renamed RadB. Recently, we found a specific interaction between RadB and DP1, the second subunit of PolD (17Hayashi I. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that there is a functional interaction between a recombination protein RadB, and a replication protein, DP1, and that RadB plays a role linking recombination directly with replication. In Escherichia coli, it has been reported that a specific interaction of RecA with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment enhance the fidelity of DNA synthesis (18Karthikeyan G. Lakshmikant G.S. Wagle M.D. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao B.J. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar). Various lines of evidences suggest that there is a coupling between recombination and replication both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (19Kogoma T. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

In this study, we analyzed the biochemical properties of RadA and RadB from P. furiosus, and the regulation of expression of theradA and radB genes in P. furiosus as the first step to understanding DNA recombination inArchaea. This is also the first report that characterizes two RecA/Rad51-like recombinases from the same archaeon. One remarkable finding is that RadB specifically interacts with Hjc, a Holliday junction resolvase in P. furiosus (29Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and regulates its cleavage activity in an ATP-dependent manner. These analyses will contribute to the complete understanding of the molecular mechanism of homologous recombination in Archaea. P. furiosus (DSM 3638) cultures were grown anaerobically in 100-ml serum bottles to approximately 1.0 × 106 cells/ml (30Robb F.T. Park J.B. Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and subjected to γ and UV irradiation and heat shock. γ irradiation was performed with a 60Co γ-ray source (at the National Institute of Standards and Technology) from 1500 and 2500 grays at a rate of 45.2 grays/min as described previously (31DiRuggiero J. Santangelo N. Nackerdien Z. Ravel J. Robb F.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4643-4645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure to UV was at a dose of 105 J/m2 in salt medium (P. furiosus medium as described earlier (30Robb F.T. Park J.B. Adams M.W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) without yeast extract and tryptone), on ice and under anaerobic condition, using a Pen-Ray far UV germicidal lamp (254 nm). Heat shock was performed by incubating the cultures at 108 °C for 1 h in an oil bath. After treatment all the cultures were incubated for 1 h at 95 °C before RNA extraction. Total cell counts were performed by acridine orange direct count, and viable cell counts were carried out by the technique of the most probable number as described previously (31DiRuggiero J. Santangelo N. Nackerdien Z. Ravel J. Robb F.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4643-4645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from 109 to 1010cells using either a protocol previously described in DiRuggiero et al.(32DiRuggiero J. Robb F.T. Robb F.T. Place A.R. Sowers K.R. Schreier H.J. DasSarma S. Fleischmann E.M. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harvor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 97-99Google Scholar) or the Bio101 Fastprep RNA extraction kit (Bio101, Vista, CA). All RNAs were submitted to DNase treatment to remove any DNA contamination. Real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 detection system by Perkin-Elmer Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and the TaqMan and SYBR Green I dye kits from Perkin-Elmer (Branchburg, NJ) as recommended by the supplier. The gene for glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) was used as the housekeeping gene to standardized the reactions. Validation experiments were performed with gdh, radA, andradB primers to validate the calculation. The level of expression of radA and radB mRNA were established as relative expression. Primers for the reverse transcriptase reaction and the PCR were designed using the Primer Express software (Perkin-Elmer Biosystems) and are as follow:gdh primers, 5′-GAATATACAACCCCGATGGTCTTAA-3′ and 5′-GAGAACATCAACCTCAAGCTCAAGTA-3′; radA primers, 5′-GTTCGGTAGTGGAAAAACTCAGCTA-3′ and 5′-AGGCCTAAATGTGTTCTCTGTGTCT-3′; and radB primers, 5′-GCTTTTAGGTGGTGGAGTTGCT-3′ and 5′-CCAACCTGCATTGCAAAAGTT-3′. The structural genes of radA and radB were amplified by PCR directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA. Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, CA) was used to maintain the accuracy of amplification. To adjust their translational initiation codon, ATG, at theNdeI site (for radA) or NcoI (for RadB) site of an expression vector pET21a (radA) or pET21d (radB) (Novagen, WI), a NdeI (NcoI) recognition sequence was made in each forward primer. In the reverse primers, a XhoI site (radA) or aHindIII site (radB) was made just after the termination codons. The PCR products were digested withNdeI-XhoI or NcoI-BamHI and inserted into the corresponding site of pET21a. The resultant plasmids were designated pPFRADA and pPFRADB, respectively. E. coliJM109 (DE3) carrying pPFRADA was cultivated in 1 liter of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to A 600 of 0.4, and the expression of radA was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After incubation for a further 7 h at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were disrupted by sonication in a sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethansulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.4 m NaCl, and the soluble extract was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min. The heat-resistant fraction was taken by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min and was mixed with polyethylenimine at a final concentration of 0.5%. RadA protein was eluted with 0.3 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) from the precipitate after polyethylenimine treatment. The supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 2 m ammonium sulfate and applied onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RadA protein was eluted at 1–0.5 m ammonium sulfate, and the fractions were dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.2 m NaCl. The dialysate was applied onto a heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the protein was eluted at 0.5–0.7 m NaCl. The fractions were mixed with the same volume of buffer A and were applied onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RadA protein was eluted at 0.35–0.37 m NaCl, and the fraction was stored on ice. E. coli JM109 (DE3) carrying pPFRADB was cultivated in 6 liters of LB-ampicillin medium toA 600 of 0.4, and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for induction ofradB gene expression. After incubation for 16 h at 20 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were suspended in sonication buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and were disrupted by sonication, and the supernatant collected by centrifugation was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was treated with 0.5% polyethylenimine, and the precipitate was suspended in buffer A containing 0.8 m of ammonium sulfate to elute RadB protein. The supernatant was mixed with ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 1.5 m and was applied onto a phenyl-Sepharose column. This step was repeated three times to remove DNA from the RadB fraction. RadB protein eluted at 1–0.5 mammonium sulfate was dialyzed against buffer B (buffer A containing 0.1m NaCl) and was applied onto a heparin column. The protein fractions eluted at 0.7–1.2 m NaCl were dialyzed against buffer B and were applied onto a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RadB protein eluted at 0.8–1.4 m NaCl was dialyzed against buffer B, and the fraction was stored on ice. The concentrations of RadA and RadB were determined by using a molar extinction coefficient εM of 13,370m−1·cm−1 and 15930m−1·cm−1, which were obtained by the method of Gill and von Hippel (33Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). For the check of nuclease contamination in the purified proteins, deoxyoligonucleotides (both single-stranded and double-stranded) or the linearized pUC118 byPstI digestion were labeled with 32P and incubated with RadA or RadB at 70 °C for 1 h. Reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis followed by autoradiograpy. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against homogenous RadA as previously reported for RadB (17Hayashi I. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4695-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Hjc (29Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), protein intron (PI)-PfuI, and PI-PfuII (34Komori K. Fujita N. Ichiyanagi K Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4167-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature. RadA, RadB, Hjc, and inteins (PI-PfuI and PI-PfuII, as negative controls) proteins (0.5 μg of each) in various combinations were mixed in 50 μl of TBS-T buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and treated at 60 °C for 5 min. After cooling down at room temperature, anti-RadA, -RadB, -Hjc, -PI-PfuI, or -PI-PfuII, antiserum was added to the mixtures and incubated for 20 min. The mixtures were added to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and were further incubated for 1 h with rotary shaker. Protein A-Sepharose-bound antigen-antibody complexes were separated from free proteins by centrifugation followed by washing three times in TBS-T buffer. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the supplier's protocol. To investigate the effect of ATP on the formation of RadB-Hjc complex, ATP was added to 2.5 mm in the TBS-T buffer. ATPase activity of RadA and RadB were measured essentially as described previously (35Weinstock G.M. McEntee K. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8829-8834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). RadA or RadB protein (each at 2 μm), [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 μ Ci/μl), and 100 μm of ATP were incubated with or without DNA (single-stranded or double-stranded M13 DNA, 0.2 μg) in 20 μl of ATPase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT) at 70 °C for indicated time, and aliquots of reactions were analyzed by a thin layer chromatography. The amount of ATP and Pi([γ-32P]ATP) or ADP ([α-32P]ATP) were quantified from the autoradiograms using a laser-excited image analyzer (BAS5000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). In the other experiment, RadA or RadB protein (each at 1 μm) was incubated with 50 or 1 μm of ATP containing [α-32P]ATP in the presence of single-stranded DNA at 70 °C, and aliquots of the reaction were analyzed for ATP hydrolysis and binding activities. Protein-bound nucleotides were separated by a disposable spin column of SUPREC-02 (Takara Shuzo) and were washed with ATPase buffer twice and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Various concentrations of RadA and RadB were incubated with 1 μm (as nucleotide concentration) of a 32P-labeled single-stranded 83-mer, W16(−) (its nucleotide sequence was shown earlier (36Gupta R.C. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), or a double-stranded 83-mer, W16(−)/W16(+), in exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mmATP) at 60 °C for 10 min. Then reaction products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.1× TAE buffer, and the bands were detected by autoradiography. The amounts of protein-DNA complex were quantified from the autoradiograms using a laser-excited image analyzer. RadA or RadB (at 1 μm) were mixed with 1 μm (as nucleotide) of32P-labeled 83-mer oligonucleotide, W16(−), at various timing and incubated in 19 μl of exchange buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. Then M13 double-stranded DNA (0.1 μg) was added to the mixtures and further incubated for 2 or 5 min. The reaction using E. coli RecA, which was prepared as described earlier (37Morimatsu K. Horii T. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), was performed by the same condition except at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were deproteinized at 37 °C for 20 min in proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) and SDS (0.5%) and separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.1× TAE buffer. The gels were dried and autoradiographed. RadA (7.5 μm) and RadB (3.7 or 7.4 μm) were mixed with single-stranded pUC118 (18 μm nucleotide) at various timing and incubated in exchange buffer at 70 °C for 20 min. Then,PstI-digested and 3′-32P-labeled double-stranded pUC118 (14.5 μm nucleotide) was added to the mixtures and further incubated for 1 h. RecA (6 μm) was preincubated with single-stranded DNA for 10 min at 37 °C, and thenE. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (Stratagene, CA) was added in the mixture at a concentration of 1 μm. After 10 min of incubation, the strand exchange reaction was initiated by adding 3′-32P-labeled double-stranded DNA, and the mixture was incubated for 7 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were deproteinized by proteinase K and separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer. The bands were detected by autoradiography. RadA protein (5.6 μm) was incubated with 21 μm (nucleotides) single-stranded pUC118 in a buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT) containing 1 mmATPγS at 90 °C for 15 min. RadB protein (7.8 μm) was incubated in the same buffer with or without 1 mm ATPγS at 60 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were applied to glow-discharged grids and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Images were recorded at nominally 48,000 in a JEOL 100cx electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The magnification was calibrated from 23 Å pitch helix of tabacco mosaic virus. Electron micrographs were digitized in a CCD scanner (DSS-1010: DS Scanner Co.) using a step size of 7.2 × 7.2 μm. Contour length of RadA single-stranded pUC118 complexes were measured using SPIDER and Web. Hjc protein (5 nm) was premixed with RadA (3 μm) or RadB (3 μm) proteins and then incubated with 14 μm(as nucleotide concentration) of 32P-labeled four-way junction, 4Jh in the exchange buffer (29Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with or without 2.5 mm of ATP at 60 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were deproteinized by proteinase K and phenol treatment and separated by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer. The bands were detected by autoradiography. The amounts of substrate and product were quantified from the autoradiograms using a laser-excited image analyzer. Amino acid sequence comparisons showed that RadA and RadB have 54 and 29% similarity, respectively, to the yeast Rad51. In contrast, they exhibited only 29 and 18% similarity to E. coli RecA. The sequence identity between the two Rad proteins is 21% (33% similarity) when they are compared using their entire regions. Fig.1 A shows a diagram of representative RecA/Rad51 family proteins. RadA is about 100 amino acids longer than RadB and has an N-terminal domain (Domain I) that shares conserved sequence with the N-terminal domains of eukaryotic Rad51 proteins. RadB consists solely of the central core domain (Domain II) of this protein family. The amino acid sequence identity of the Domain II in RadA and RadB is about 28% (45% similarity). Both RadA and RadB present the 9-signature amino acids characteristic of archaeal recombinases as described by Sandler et al. (9Sandler S.J. Hugenholtz P. Schleper C. DeLong E.F. Pace N.R. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RadA has two insertions and one deletion relative to theE. coli RecA sequence as reported for other RadAs from Euryarchaeotes. The structural genes for RadA and RadB (radA and radB) were amplified from P. furiosus genomic DNA by PCR and the products were inserted into the expression vector, pET21a. The recombinant E. coli JM109 (DE3) strains carrying one of the resultant plasmids, pPFRADA or pPFRADB, were cultivated, and the target proteins were successfully overproduced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. However, the purification of these proteins was difficult because of their high affinity for DNA. Additional chromatographic steps had to be performed to remove the DNA and to purify the two proteins to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 B). The bands of RadA and RadB were detected on the SDS-PAGE at positions corresponding to their molecular weights, 38396.8 and 25337.9, respectively, which were calculated from the deduced amino acid sequences. From 1 liter of E. coliculture, about 3.4 mg of RadA and 0.17 mg of RadB were purified. No DNase activity was detected in either RadA or RadB from the assays using 32P-labeled DNA substrates (data not shown). We prepared polyclonal antibodies using purified RadA and RadB proteins. Western blot analysis showed that proteins reacting specifically with either anti-RadA or anti-RadB antiserum were present in the P. furiosus cell extract (Fig. 1 C). By comparisons of the band intensities from the cell extract and from serial dilution of purified RadA and RadB, we calculated that the cellular amounts of native proteins were 70 μg (1.8 nmols) and 0.2 μg (7.9 pmols) for RadA and RadB, respectively, per 1 g (wet weight) of the cells. The amount of RadB was 200 times less than that of RadA in P. furiosus cells. This is in contrast to the RNA data described below. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and the ABI Prism 7700 detection system, we investigated the level of expression of the radAand radB genes in P. furiosus cells exposed to sublethal doses of γ and UV irradiation and heat. Cells treated with γ irradiation showed no loss of viability at 1500 grays and 75% survival when the culture was exposed to a dose of 2500 grays (31DiRuggiero J. Santangelo N. Nackerdien Z. Ravel J. Robb F.T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4643-4645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No loss of viability was observed for the cells exposed to 35 J of UV light at 254 nm when compared with the unirradiated control. Cells subjected to 108 °C for 1 h showed 80% survival compared with the control cells incubated at 95 °C for 1 h. Fig.2 shows that for all the treatments, the level of radA and radB mRNA did not increase in the treated cells compared with untreated control cells. We obtained the same pattern of expression for theradA and radB genes using nuclease protection assay. 2J. DiRuggiero and F. Chaussard, unpublished results. These results suggest that the expressions of radA and radB might be constitutive. This is in contrast to the transcription of the recA (38Fernandez de Henestrosa A.R Calero S. Barbe J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 226: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) andRAD51 genes, which are inducible by UV irradiation and DNA damage (39Basile"

The role of PSI-F was investigated in Arabidopsis plants transformed with an antisense construct of the psaF cDNA. Several plant lines with reduced amounts of the PSI-F subunit were generated. Many of the transgenic plants died, apparently because they were unable to survive without the PSI-F subunit. Plants with 5% of PSI-F were capable of photoautotrophic growth but were much smaller than wild-type plants. The plants suffered severely under normal growth conditions but recovered somewhat in the dark indicating chronic photoinhibition. Photosystem I lacking PSI-F was less stable, and the stromal subunits PSI-C, PSI-D, and PSI-E were present in lower amounts than in wild type. The lack of PSI-F resulted in an inability of light-harvesting complex I-730 to transfer energy to the P700 reaction center. In thylakoids deficient in PSI-F, the steady state NADP+reduction rate was only 10% of the wild-type levels indicating a lower efficiency in oxidation of plastocyanin. Surprisingly, the lack of PSI-F also gave rise to disorganization of the thylakoids. The strict arrangement in grana and stroma lamellae was lost, and instead a network of elongated and distorted grana was observed.

The PSI core in higher plants contains 13–14 different subunits denoted PSI-A to PSI-N. One copy of each subunit is present per PSI reaction center. Angiosperm plants do not contain the PSI-M subunit. In addition to the PSI core, plants have a peripheral antenna associated with PSI. The peripheral antenna is known as light-harvesting complex I (LHCI) and is composed of four different subunits denoted Lhca1 to Lhca4. P700, the primary electron donor of PSI, is bound to the two larger reaction center polypeptides, PSI-A and PSI-B, near the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and thus is accessible to plastocyanin, the secondary electron donor. Two low molecular mass subunits, PSI-F and PSI-N, have been implicated in the interaction between PSI and plastocyanin. PSI-F is a transmembrane protein with a large lumenal domain. Regions of PSI-F are highly conserved between species, but eukaryotic PSI-F has an N-terminal extension (1Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The 18 extra residues in eukaryotic PSI-F appear to form an amphipathic helix located on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane (2Hippler M. Reichert J. Sutter M. Zak E. Altschmied L. Schröer U. Herrmann R.G. Haehnel W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6374-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition to providing positive charges, this helix may serve to bring plastocyanin into the proper orientation for efficient electron transfer (3Hippler M. Drepper F. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 23: 7339-7344Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Results of cross-linking experiments in maize and spinach suggest that PSI-F is involved in docking soluble plastocyanin to the PSI core complex (4Wynn R.M. Malkin R.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 280-284Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Strong evidence for the involvement of PSI-F in plastocyanin docking has been obtained in a gene knockout study in Chlamydomonas (1Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). InChlamydomonas PSI lacking PSI-F, plastocyanin, and PSI did not form the stable complex that is normally seen, and the second order rate constant for electron transfer was 20–100 times slower. Despite the change in kinetic constants, the mutant algae could grow photoautotrophically almost as well as the wild type (1Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, the PSI-F protein appears to have a completely different function as a PSI-F-less mutant of SynechocystisPCC 6803 was unaffected in docking of plastocyanin and cytochromec 553 (8Xu Q., Yu., L. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chitnis P.R. Purvis D. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20146-20151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the psaF deletion mutant, the PSI-A, PSI-B, and PSI-E subunits were more easily degraded by thermolysin. Thus, the PSI-F subunit has a dispensable accessory role in the function and organization of the SynechocystisPSI complex (8Xu Q., Yu., L. Chitnis V.P. Chitnis P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3205-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the N-terminal region of eukaryotic PSI-F mediates the efficient binding of plastocyanin and fast electron transport kinetics that are characteristic of eukaryotic PSI. The introduction into Synechococcus elongatus of a modified PSI-F containing the N-terminal part of Chlamydomonas PSI-F led to a large increase in the rate of reaction with plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 (10Hippler M. Drepper F. Rochaix J.-D. Muhlenhoff U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4180-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A few reports have suggested that the PSI-F polypeptide is associated with LHCI (11Anandan S. Vainstein A. Thornber J.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Bassi R. Soen S.Y. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25714-25721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSI contains about 300 antenna chlorophyll molecules per P700 reaction center (13Bassi R. Simpson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Most of the chlorophyll antenna molecules are localized in LHCI, which is specific to PSI, and LHCII, which functions as light-harvesting complex for both photosystems. The remaining about 90 chlorophyll molecules per P700 are bound to the PSI core. The pigment proteins that carry the peripheral antenna chlorophylls can be separated from a core of proteins carrying the reaction center, the electron transfer components, and tightly bound antenna chlorophylls. The frequently observed absence of PSI-F in isolated core complexes devoid of LHCI suggests that in plants this subunit is bound to LHCI (5Wynn R.M. Luong C. Malkin R. Plant Physiol. 1989; 91: 445-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Scheller H.V. Møller B.L. Physiol. Plant. 1990; 78: 484-494Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There are 10 distinct types of LHC proteins encoded by the differentlhc genes (15Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), which have been highly conserved for at least 345 million years of evolution (16Jansson S. Gustafsson P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This means that all 10 must have specific functions within the light-harvesting apparatus, since random genetic drift would otherwise have eliminated some of the corresponding genes without positive selection pressure for their preservation. The lhca1–4 genes encode the antenna proteins of LHCI. The lhcb1 and lhcb2 genes encode the most abundant proteins of the LHCII trimers, which can associate with either PSI or PSII, and lhcb3–6 genes encode PSII-specific antenna proteins (17Jansson S. Pichersky E. Bassi R. Green B.R. Ikeuchi M. Melis A. Simpson D.J. Spangfort M. Staehelin L.A. Thornber J.P. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 10: 242-253Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The Lhca proteins are organized as dimers (18Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Lhca1 and Lhca4 form heterodimers, LHCI-730, characterized by a 77 K fluorescence emission peak at 730 nm (19Schmid V.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Lhca2 and Lhca3 appear to be organized as homodimers forming LHCI-680, which can be fractionated into LHCI-680a (Lhca3) and LHCI-680b (Lhca2) both fluorescing at 680 nm at 77 K (20Knoetzel J. Svendsen I. Simpson D.J. Eur. J. Biochemistry. 1992; 206: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, two additional genes were identified and named lhca5 and lhca6, but their expression is very low, so the proteins may not be normal subunits of LHCI (21Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of Lhca subunits in PSI is not clear, but eight Lhca subunits per reaction center have been suggested (15Jansson S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The PSI-N subunit has only been found in PSI of higher plants. It is still uncertain whether PSI-N is present in green algae. PSI-N is the only extrinsic PSI subunit on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. Recently, PSI-N was shown to be important for efficient electron transfer from plastocyanin to P700 (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the absence of PSI-N, the second order rate constant for plastocyanin oxidation was decreased to about 60%. Presumably, PSI-N helps PSI-F in docking plastocyanin to PSI in plants. In order to determine the role of PSI-F in plants, we transformedArabidopsis plants with a psaF cDNA in antisense orientation under the control of a constitutive promoter. Transformants with reduced amounts of PSI-F protein were obtained, and the plants were analyzed using several methods at the biochemical and leaf level. We conclude that absence of PSI-F in plants, in contrast to bacteria and algae, results in impaired transfer of excitation energy from light-harvesting complexes to the PSI reaction center. In addition, PSI-F is important for electron transport from plastocyanin to the PSI reaction center as observed in bacteria and algae. However, in contrast to bacteria and algae, the reduced amounts of PSI-F lead to a widespread change in the overall structure and function of PSI leading to severe photoinhibition under normal growth conditions, and plants totally lacking PSI-F die. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyn cv. Columbia was used for all the experiments. Plants were grown in peat in a controlled environment Arabidopsis chamber (Percival AR-60L, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–120 μmol photons m−2s−1, 20 °C, and 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h for plants used for transformation, and the photoperiod was only 8 h for plants used for biochemical and physiological analysis in order to suppress the induction of flowering. A full-length cDNA clone for psaF (accession number ATT13255 (36A7T7)) was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH). A 664-base pair fragment containing the full-length cDNA including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in antisense orientation between the enhanced CaMV 35 S promoter and 35 S terminator in the pPS48 vector (24Kay R. Shan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 25Odell J.T. Nagy F. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1985; 313: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) using the BamHI andPstI sites. The sequences of the two oligonucleotides used in subcloning the antisense psaF were 5′ CGG GAT CCC GAT GTC GCT CAC TAT CCC 3′ and 5′ TTC TGC AGT TTT AAA CAT CCT TAG CAA TG 3′. Orientation of the insert was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Subsequently, a fragment containing the E35S promoter followed by the antisense psaF gene and the 35 S terminator was excised with XbaI and ligated into the two binary vectors pPZP111 (kanamycin resistance) and pPZP221 (gentamicin resistance) (26Hajdukiewiez P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). The two vector constructs were transformed independently by electroporation (27Wen-Jun S. Forde B.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8385Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) into the Agrobacterium tumefaciensstrain C58 (28Zambryski P. Joos H. Genetello C. Leemans J. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two constructs were designated “57” and “37,” respectively. Plasmid integrity in A. tumefacienscultures used for plant transformation was verified by polymerase chain reaction analysis on colonies. Plant transformation was performed according to Clough and Bent (29Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 0.005% Silwett L-77 as surfactant for 5 min. Leaves from 6-week-oldArabidopsis plants were cut transversely while submerged in 2% glutaraldehyde, 10 mm MgCl2 in 0.06m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and fixed in this solution for 2 h. This was followed by two washes in phosphate buffer and post-fixation in 1% OsO4 in 0.06 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. Samples were chemically dehydrated in acidified dimethoxypropane and embedded in Spurr's resin. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and post-stained for 30 min with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate at 40 °C followed by Reynolds' lead citrate for 80 s at 20 °C and examined with a Zeiss 902 electron microscope (30Simpson D.J. von Wettstein D. Carlsburg Res. Commun. 1980; 45: 283-314Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Leaves from 6–8-week-old plants were used for isolation of thylakoids as described previously (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Total Chl and Chl a/b ratio were determined in 80% acetone according to Lichtenthaler (31Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (8969) Google Scholar). The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The P700 content was determined from the ferricyanide-oxidized minus ascorbate-reduced difference spectrum using an extinction coefficient of 64 mm−1 cm−1(32Hiyama T. Ke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Plants lacking the PSI-F subunit were identified by immunoblotting. Crude leaf extracts were prepared as described in Haldrup et al. (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Each sample loaded on the gels represented 1 μg of Chl. Immunoblotting was carried out by transferring electrophoresed proteins to nitrocellulose membranes followed by incubation with polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against barley PSI-F protein (33Andersen B. Koch B. Scheller H.V. Physiol. Plant. 1992; 84: 154-161Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and visualization with the use of either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Copenhagen, Denmark). Isolated thylakoids were analyzed in similar immunoblotting procedures using antibodies raised in rabbits against barley PSI-A/B, -C -D, -F, -H, -K, -N, Lhca1, Lhca2, Lhca3, Lhca4, Lhcb1, and Lhcb2. Plastocyanin antibodies and PSI-E antibodies were raised againstArabidopsis plastocyanin and PSI-E. The NDH-I antibody was raised against a fusion protein from tobacco (34Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and antibodies against phosphothreonine were obtained from New England Biolabs. In each lane in the SDS gels, 0.1–1 μg of Chl were loaded depending on the linear range for each of the primary antibodies. All antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (SuperSignalTM, Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Antibodies were the kind gift of Dr. Stefan Jansson, University of Umeå, Umeå, Sweden (Lhca and Lhcb), Dr. Peter Nixon, Imperial College of Science, London, UK (NDH-I), and Dr. Olivier Vallon, Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France (PSI-B). The fluorescence spectrum at 77 K was recorded for thylakoids from dark-adapted plants using a bifurcated light guide connected to a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer. The excitation light had a wavelength of 435 nm, and emission was detected from 650 to 800 nm. Functional PSI antenna size was determined from light-induced P700 absorption changes at 810 nm using the Dual Wavelength Emitter Detector Unit ED-P700DW-E connected via a PAM 101 Fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) to a Tektronix TDS420 oscilloscope. A leaf from a dark-adapted plant was fixed to the light fiber. After recording for 5 s, the leaf was illuminated by far-red light (actinic light from a Walz 102-FR source (λmax = 735 nm)) to excite P700 and the induced P700 absorption changes were measured over a 20-s period. Then the actinic light was switched off, and re-reduction of P700+ was followed for another 25 s. For each leaf, four traces were averaged, and three leaves from each plant were analyzed. Antenna function is expressed as the maximal absorption change at steady state. Flash-induced P700 absorption change was measured at 834 nm, essentially as described previously (35Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 36Tjus S.E. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The saturating actinic pulse (532 nm, 6 ns) was produced by a Nd:YAG laser. Thylakoids (32 μg Chl ml−1) were dissolved in 250 μl of 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1%n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, 2 mmsodium ascorbate, and 60 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The solution was centrifuged three times for 20 s at 200 ×g to remove starch grains prior to measurement. The sample (200 μl) was transferred to a cuvette with 1 cm path length. A diode laser provided the measuring beam, which was detected using a photodiode. A total of 32 flash-induced decay curves were collected and averaged for each sample. The recorded absorption changes were resolved into exponential decay components by a Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear regression procedure. NADP+ photoreduction activity of PSI was determined from the absorbance change at 340 nm as described by Naveret al. (35Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using thylakoids equivalent to 5 μg of Chl. Thylakoids were solubilized in 0.09% decylmaltoside prior to the measurement. Saturating light was used during the measurement. Determination of conventional fluorescence quenching parameters was performed with a PAM 101-103 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) by using a standard set up as reported previously (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed under growth light conditions, and a leaf was fixed with tape to the end of the light fiber. Steady state fluorescence (F s) was obtained, and a saturating pulse (0.8 s) of white light (6000 μmol photons m−2 s−1) was applied allowing determination of maximum fluorescence (F m′). After the first flash, aluminum foil was wrapped around the fiber to determine F o′ and to dark-adapt the leaf. A saturating pulse was subsequently applied every 10 min. PSII quantum yield (ΦPSII) was calculated as (F m′ −F s)/F m′ and excitation pressure (1 − q p) as (F s −F o′)/(F m′ −F o′). The original transformed lines were self-pollinated, and the seeds produced were plated on media containing kanamycin or gentamicin. A large number of plants died after being moved from tissue culture to soil, and others were too small for use in any experiments. These plants were most likely completely lacking PSI-F and not capable of photoautotrophic growth. Plants that were sufficiently healthy to be further analyzed were screened by immunoblotting. Different levels of down-regulation were detected. The detection limit was about 3% of wild-type PSI-F content. Plants with 0–3% PSI showed a significantly decreased growth rate compared with wild type (Fig. 1) and usually died after few weeks in soil. Small, yellowish plants struggling to survive could be rescued by placing them under low light conditions or in the dark for 2–3 days. The plants subsequently started to produce new shoots and looked healthier. Plants with 5–40% PSI-F also had a changed phenotype being smaller than wild-type plants. This has not been observed in plants lacking PSI-N, PSI-H, or PSI-K (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 37Naver H. Haldrup A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In plants with 5% PSI-F, the Chla/b ratio was 1.76 ± 0.20 (±S.D.), and in wild-type plants the ratio was 2.16 ± 0.01. The difference was significant (t test, p < 0.001). A decreased Chl a/b ratio indicates a decreased PSI/PSII ratio or an increased antenna size. The Chl/P700 ratio was 988 ± 120 (±S.D.) for transgenic plants with 5% PSI-F and 849 ± 237 for wild-type plants. The PSI-F-deficient plants thus have 10–20% less PSI compared with wild-type plants. However, the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, transgenicArabidopsis plants without PSI-N (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), PSI-H (37Naver H. Haldrup A. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10784-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or PSI-K (38Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) all compensate for a poorly functioning PSI by making 18–20% more PSI. The grana of plants with 3% PSI-F have a larger diameter (0.86 ± 0.13 μm) than those of wild-type (0.48 ± 0.09 μm) and fewer discs per granum (3.9 ± 1.2) compared with wild-type (8.8 ± 2.8) (Fig. 2). Stroma lamellae were essentially absent. Plants with 40% PSI-F showed thylakoid structure similar to those with 3% PSI-F. PSI-F-deficient plants were analyzed with a range of antibodies (Fig. 3). For this investigation thylakoids were prepared from plants with about 5% PSI-F and from plants with about 40% PSI-F. Because of the postulated involvement of PSI-F in LCHI function (11Anandan S. Vainstein A. Thornber J.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Bassi R. Soen S.Y. Frank G. Zuber H. Rochaix J.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25714-25721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), we investigated if the absence of PSI-F would lead to a secondary loss of LHCI proteins (Fig. 3 a). Surprisingly, the content of Lhca4 in thylakoids was increased, whereas the content of Lhca1, Lhca2, and Lhca3 was decreased. LHCII is normally down-regulated in plants grown under high light, i.e. with a high excitation pressure, but we found increased amounts of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2. LHCII and D1 proteins showed high levels of phosphorylation, as shown by reaction with the phosphothreonine antibody which detected 120–700% more phosphorylation in plants with 5% PSI-F compared with wild type (Fig.3 b). Compared with wild type, the amount of PSI-A and PSI-B was higher in thylakoids with 40% PSI-F but lower in thylakoids with 5% PSI-F, and PSI-B was partly degraded (Fig. 3 c). Thus, plants with 40% PSI-F seemed to be capable of up-regulating the amount of PSI based on PSI-A/B levels, in the same way as plants without PSI-N, PSI-H, and PSI-K (23Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 37Naver H. Haldrup A. Scheller H.V. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Partial degradation of the PSI-A and PSI-B proteins is a typical symptom of light-induced PSI damage (39Tjus S.E. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 75-86Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The extrinsic subunits PSI-C, PSI-D, and PSI-E were all present at 15–60% of wild-type levels (Fig. 3 c). PSI-N was almost absent and PSI-K was not detectable in thylakoids with 5% PSI-F. The level of PSI-H was normal. The amount of plastocyanin was increased in PSI-F-deficient plants. Plastocyanin content in barley is positively correlated with growth irradiance (40Burkey K.O. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 36: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), indicating that the PSI-F-deficient plants in some respects behave like plants exposed to high light conditions. The increased amounts of NDH-I and D1 are consistent with the enhanced levels observed in light-stressed plants (39Tjus S.E. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 75-86Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Teicher, H. B., Møller, B. L., and Scheller, H. V. (2000) Photosynth. Res., in press.Google Scholar). Leaves with 3–5% PSI-F showed a 7-nm blue shift in the fluorescence emission maximum to 727 nm (Fig. 4). This blue shift resembles the 6 nm shift observed in Arabidopsisplants with reduced levels of Lhca4 (42Zhang H. Goodman H.M. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, Knoetzel et al. (43Knoetzel J. Bossmann B. Grimme L.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) found a similar blue shift in barley mutants lacking Lhca4. When PSI is excited with far-red light, most of the photons are absorbed by the long wavelength chlorophylls in Lhca1 and Lhca4 (44Croce R. Zucchelli G. Garlaschi F.M. Jennings R.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17355-17360Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The very small absorbance change at 810 nm in leaves with reduced amounts of PSI-F shows that only a small amount of P700 became oxidized (Fig. 5). Thus, excitation energy transfer from Lhca1 and Lhca4 to P700 was severely impaired in the absence of PSI-F.Figure 5Antenna function in PSI-F-deficient and wild-type plants. Antenna function of PSI was measured by light-induced P700 absorption changes in leaves at 810 nm after excitation of LHCI-730 at 735 nm. Representative traces of wild-type (WT) leaves and leaves with different degree of down-regulation are shown. a, 15% PSI-F; b, 5% PSI-F; c, 0–3% PSI-F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lack of steady state P700 photo-oxidation in far-red light could also result from a non-functional acceptor chain. To investigate this possibility, P700 flash measurements were performed. The time constant (τ) for charge recombination between (F A/F B)− and P700+ is known to be >30 ms. With damage toF A/F B, the charge recombination will proceed from F x− with a τ ≈ 1 ms. With further damage to the electron transport chain, the charge recombination from eitherA 1− orA 0−, via the P700 triplet state, takes place in 3–5 μs. The back reaction fromA 0− to P700+, with a τ of approximately 30 ns, is below the 1-μs time resolution of our experimental system. For wild-type PSI the decay time"

Prey capture is accomplished through a sophisticated arsenal of peptides that target specific ion channel and receptor subtypes. Each Conus venom appears to contain a unique set of 50–200 peptides. The structure and function of only a small minority of these peptides have been determined to date. For peptides where function has been determined, three classes of targets have been elucidated: voltage-gated ion channels, ligand-gated ion channels, and G-protein-linked receptors. Conus peptides that target voltage-gated ion channels include those that delay the inactivation of sodium channels as well as blockers specific for sodium channels, calcium channels, and potassium channels. Peptides that target ligand-gated ion channels include antagonists of N-methyl-d-aspartate and serotonin receptors as well as competitive and non-competitive nicotinic receptor antagonists. Peptides that act on G protein receptors include neurotensin and vasopressin receptor agonists. The unprecedented targeting selectivity of conotoxins derives from specific disulfide bond frameworks combined with hypervariable amino acids within disulfide loops (see Ref. 1McIntosh J.M. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 294: 605-624Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar for review). Due to the high potency and exquisite selectivity of the conopeptides, several are in various stages of clinical development for treatment of human disorders (2Jones R.M. Bulaj G. Curr.

Reverse phase HPLC purification was accomplished with an analytical (4.6 mm internal diameter × 25 cm) Vydac C18 column. Column pore size was 300 Å. Additional conditions are described in Fig. 1. The peptide was reduced, and cysteines were carboxymethylated as described previously (6Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The alkylated peptide was purified with a Vydac C18 analytical column using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 0.092% trifluoroacetic acid in 60% acetonitrile. Alkylated peptide was sequenced by Edman degradation at the Peptide Core Facility at the University of Utah. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were measured using a Micromass Quattro II Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer with Micromass MassLynx operating system. The samples (∼100 pmol) were resuspended in 0.1 ml of 50% acetonitrile with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and automatically infused with a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min in the same solvent system. The instrument was scanned over them/z range 50–2,000 with a capillary voltage of 2.95 kV and a cone voltage of 64 V. The resulting data were analyzed using MassLynx software. Peptides were synthesized, 0.45 mmol/g, on a RINK amide resin (Fmoc-Cys(Trityl)-Wang, Novabiochem (04-12-2050)) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarboxyl) chemistry and standard side chain protection except on cysteine residues. Cys residues were protected in pairs with either S-trityl orS-acetamidomethyl groups. Amino acid derivatives were from Advanced Chemtech (Louisville, KY). All three possible disulfide forms of the peptide were synthesized. The peptides were removed from the resin and precipitated, and a two-step oxidation protocol was used to selectively fold the peptides as described previously (7Walker C. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C. Nielsen J.S. Zhou L. Bandyopadhyay P. Craig A. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30664-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The sequence of the mr10a peptide was used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers for use in 5′ and 3′ RACE amplification of the mr10a precursor cDNA. A 3′ RACE forward primer (mr10a-F, CAGGATCC AA(T/C) GGI GT(C/T/G) TG(T/C) TG(T/C) GG) was based on the peptide sequence NGVCCG. A 5′ RACE reverse primer (mr10a-R, CTGGATCC GG (A/G)TG (A/G)CA (C/A/G)A(G/A) (T/C)TT (G/A)TA ICC) was based on the peptide sequence GYKLCHP. C. marmoreus venom duct RNA was prepared, and cDNA appended with 3′ and 5′ adapter sequences was synthesized by standard methods (8Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 28-45Google Scholar). To facilitate cloning of the RACE amplification products, the mr10a primers incorporated BamHI sites, and the 3′ and 5′ adapter primers contained XhoI sites. RACE amplifications were performed using a “touchdown” cycling protocol consisting of an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 30 s followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s , 65 °C for 15 s, decreasing 0.5 °C each cycle, 72 °C for 10 s, then 15 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications were performed using Taq polymerase (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and amplification reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. RACE amplification products were isolated from the gel (Qiaex II DNA purification resin; Qiagen, Inc., Santa Clarita, CA), digested with BamHI and XhoI, and cloned into the plasmid vector pBluescript II SK−(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmids containing inserts of the appropriate size were selected and sequenced on an ABI Prism 373 Fluorescent DNA Sequencer. Adult male CF-1 mice (25–35 g) were used for all experiments. Mice were housed five per cage, maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, and allowed free access to food and water. Analgesic activity was assessed by placing mice in a plexiglass cylinder (10.2-cm diameter × 30.5 cm high) on a hot plate (Mirak model HP72935, Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, IA) maintained at 55 °C. Thirty minutes before the hot plate test, animals were treated with a dose of mr10a or vehicle (0.9% saline) by free-hand intrathecal injection (9Hylden J. Wilcox G. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1980; 67: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) in a volume of 5 μl. The time from being placed on the plate until each mouse either licked its hind paws or jumped was recorded with a stopwatch by a trained observer unaware of the treatments. An arbitrary cut-off time of 60 s was adopted to minimize tissue injury. Hot plate test data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test for multiple comparison, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Shortly after the hot plate test, mice were placed on a 3-cm-diameter rotarod turning at 6 rpm (model 7650, Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy). Mice were considered impaired if they fell three times in 1 min. Rana pipiens, 2.5 to 3 inches long, were used. The dissected preparation consisted of the 9th and 10th spinal nerves and their continuation down the sciatic nerve to the posterior crural nerve, freed from the skin that it innervates (see e.g. Ref.10Ecker, A. (1889) The Anatomy of the Frog, (Haslam, G. H., translator) Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). Each spinal nerve was severed from the spine several millimeters proximal to its sympathetic ramus such that it could be electrically stimulated without activating sympathetic axons (see e.g.Ref. 11Dodd J. Horn J.P. J. Physiol. 1983; 334: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For extracellular stimulation and recording, the preparation was placed in a chamber fabricated from the silicone elastomer Sylgard (Dow Corning). The chamber was essentially a series of wells, each separated from its closest neighbor by about 1 mm. The proximal ends of the 9th and 10th nerves were placed in separate wells; the sciatic portion lay in a third well, whereas the attached lateral crural nerve spanned two additional wells, each 4 mm in diameter. All wells were filled with frog Ringer's solution (111 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.2)). All portions of the nerve that draped over the partitions between wells and otherwise exposed to air were covered with Vaseline. One of a pair of stainless steel wire stimulating electrodes was placed in the well on either side of the Vaseline gap covering a spinal nerve. One of a pair of stainless steel wire recording electrodes was placed in the well on either side of the Vaseline gap covering the lateral crural nerve. Thus for both stimulation and recording, one electrode was in the same well that containing a cut end of the nerve, whereas its counterpart was in the well containing the portion of the nerve just distal (stimulation) or proximal (recording) to the cut end. The stimulating electrodes led to a Grass SIU5 stimulus isolation unit connected to a Grass S-88 stimulator. The recording electrode in the most distal well, containing the cut end of the posterior crural nerve, led to the positive input of a Grass P-55 differential preamplifier, whereas its counterpart, led to the negative input. Recordings were made with a preamplifier gain of 1000, RC-filtered (1 Hz alternating current and 1 kHz low pass) and digitized at a sampling rate of 4 kHz with a National Instruments Lab-NB board in a Macintosh Quadra 840 computer. Homemade virtual instruments (National Instruments LabVIEW) were used for data acquisition and analysis. Supramaximal stimuli (1 ms, ∼30 V) were applied to a spinal nerve once a minute while recording propagated compound action potentials (CAPs) reaching the other end of the preparation. Conopeptide was introduced into the well just proximal to that containing the distal cut end of the posterior crural nerve. Xenopus oocytes were injected with cRNA encoding human nAChR subunits as described previously (12Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13McIntosh J.M. Gardner S. Luo S. Garrett J.E. Yoshikami D. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 393: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with α4β2 subunits were placed in a recording chamber (∼30 μl), voltage-clamped, and assessed for expression of receptor using a 1-s pulse of 300 μmacetylcholine (see Lu et al. (14Lu Y. Grady S. Marks M.J. Picciotto M. Changeux J.P. Collins A.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 648-657PubMed Google Scholar) for details). Peptide was then added to the bath to achieve a final concentration of 10 μm. ω-Conotoxin GVIA was iodinated by previously described methods (15Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6230-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding protocol was a modification of that described in Hillyard et al.(16Hillyard D.R. Monje V.D. Mintz I.M. Bean B.P. Nadasdi L. Ramachandran J. Miljanich G. Azimi-Zoonooz A. McIntosh J.M. Cruz L.J. Imperial J.S. Olivera B.M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 69-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Crude brain membranes from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described by Catterall (17Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 15-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), with modifications in buffer components as described in Cruz and Olivera (15Cruz L.J. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6230-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of125I-labeled ω-conotoxin GVIA to rat brain membrane was measured in a 200-μl assay mix that contained approximately 10 μg of membrane protein, 100,000 cpm of carrier-free ω-[125I]conotoxin GVIA (approximately 150 pm), 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.32 m sucrose, 100 mmNaCl, and 5 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4). Nonspecific binding was measured by preincubating the membrane preparation with 1 μm unlabeled ω-conotoxin GVIA for 30 min on ice before the addition of ω-[125I]conotoxin GVIA. mr10a was assessed for activity by preincubating the toxin for 30 min on ice. The final assay mix was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min and diluted with 1.5 ml of wash buffer containing 160 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4). Membranes were collected on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C soaked in 0.1% polyethyleneamine) using a Brandell apparatus model M-24 and washed with 1.5 ml of wash buffer four times. The amount of radioactivity in the filters was then measured. The procedure of Pabreza et al. (18Pabreza L.A. Dhawan S. Kellar K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 9-12PubMed Google Scholar) was used.

Extracted crude venom from C. marmoreus was initially size-fractionated using a Sephadex G-25 column (see Fig. 1). Column fractions eluting in a range corresponding to small peptides were further purified using reverse phase HPLC utilizing conditions described under “Methods and Methods” and in Fig. 1. Throughout subsequent purification, HPLC fractions were assayed by means of intracerebral ventricular injection into mice (54Clark C. Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 1981; 19: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Intracerebral ventricular injection of fractions containing mr10a produced hypokinetic “sluggish” symptoms. The venom fraction was initially purified using a trifluoroacetic/acetonitrile gradient system. To obtain further purification, the new fractions were lyophilized and resuspended in 0.05% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) and run on a reverse phase C18 column using a 0.05% HFBA, acetonitrile gradient. Further purification was obtained using strong cation exchange chromatography. The fraction was then desalted using reverse phase HPLC. Final purified product is shown in Fig.2, panel B. The disulfide bonds of the purified peptide were reduced, and Cys residues were carboxymethylated. The alkylated peptide was then chemically sequenced and yielded NGVCCGYKLCHOC, where O is 4-trans-hydroxyproline. Mass spectrometry of the peptide verified the sequence and indicated that Cys residues are present as disulfides and the C terminus is the free carboxyl (monoisotopic MH+ (Da): calculated, 1408.5; observed, 1408.5). The sequence of the peptide was independently confirmed by preparation of synthetic peptide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mr10a peptide has four Cys residues and, therefore, three possible disulfide linkages. All three disulfide bond linkages were synthesized to unequivocally identify the native configuration. Peptides were initially synthesized in linear form using pairwise protection of Cys residues (see “Experimental Procedures”). Acid cleavage from resin removed trityl-protecting groups, and ferricyanide oxidation was used to close the first disulfide bridge. Iodine oxidation was subsequently used to remove S-acetamidomethyl protection groups and close the second bridge. Using this method, each possible disulfide arrangement was synthesized, i.e. Cys1-Cys2, Cys3-Cys4; Cys1-Cys3, Cys2-Cys4, and Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys3. Final purified yields of each peptide were 12.5, 5.2, and 12.4%, respectively. Synthesis of each isomer was confirmed with mass spectrometry (calculated monoisotopic MH+, 1408.5; observed, 1408.6, 1408.7, and 1408.6, respectively). The three forms of the peptide were distinguishable using reverse phase HPLC based on elution time. In addition, they were distinguishable by peak width, with the (Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys3) form having the narrowest peak width (Fig. 2). Both the elution time and peak shape of the (Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys3) disulfide form match that of the native peptide. Additionally, co-injection of each synthetic form indicates that native mr10a co-elutes only with synthetic peptide of the (Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys3) configuration, providing unambiguous evidence for this disulfide linkage being native (Fig. 2). The mr10a peptide sequence was used to design degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers for 3′ and 5′ RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) amplification of the complete mr10a precursor cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to yield overlapping 3′ and 5′ RACE products, allowing the complete cDNA sequence to be assembled from the two sequences. Amplification of C. marmoreus cDNA gave specific products of 610 base pairs in the 3′ RACE and 300 base pairs in the 5′ RACE reactions. These polymerase chain reaction products were cloned, and multiple clones of both the 5′ and 3′ RACE products were isolated and sequenced. For both the 5′ and 3′ RACE products, the multiple clones all represented the same sequence, and the appropriate segments of the mr10a peptide sequence were represented by the cloned sequence. The 5′ and 3′ RACE product sequences were assembled to give the complete mr10a prepropeptide precursor cDNA sequence (Fig.3). The first ATG start codon encountered from the 5′ end of the cDNA initiates an open reading frame of 61 amino acids, encoding a protein with a structure typical of a conotoxin prepropeptide. The first 24 N-terminal amino acids compose a hydrophobic signal sequence region. The mature mr10a peptide sequence is located at the C-terminal end of the precursor sequence, immediately preceded by a basic amino acid (Arg) signaling proteolytic peptide processing. The stop codon is immediately downstream of the last cysteine residue of the mr10a peptide. A 3′-untranslated region of ∼500 base pairs is terminated by a typical poly(A)+addition signal (AATAAA) and a poly(A) tail. The mr10a precursor exhibits significant sequence homology to a previously identified family of conotoxin genes, the T-superfamily, although the mature mr10a peptide is distinct from any of the previously isolated T-superfamily conotoxins (Fig.4). Previously isolated T-superfamily conotoxins all share the cysteine framework CC–CC (7Walker C. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C. Nielsen J.S. Zhou L.

RNA polymerase TATA box-binding protein polymerase chain reaction electrophoretic mobility shift assay preinitiation complex bacterial-archaeal double-stranded transcription factor B transcription factor IIB Biochemical dissection of the basal transcription machinery of archaea and the eucaryal RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 II apparatus has revealed that they are fundamentally related (1Orphanides G.

In both systems, the initiating step is the recruitment of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) to the core promoter. In archaea, this is mediated by the direct interaction of TBP with a TATA-box element (4Rowlands T. Baumann P. Jackson S.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1326-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Kosa P.F. Ghosh G. DeDecker B.S. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6042-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In eucarya TBP exists within the TFIID complex, allowing TBP to be recruited not only by direct TATA-box interactions but also by interactions between TBP-associated factors and other core promoter elements (6Smale S.T. Jain A. Kaufman J. Emami K.H. Lo K. Garraway I.P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7Burke T.W. Willy P.J. Kutach A.K. Butler J.E.F. Kadonaga J.T. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The TBP-DNA complex then recruits archaeal TFB or its eucaryal homologue, TFIIB. In many archaeal promoters TFB interacts with a sequence element, the BRE (TFB-responsiveelement), situated immediately upstream of the TATA box (8Qureshi S.A. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The co-operative binding of TBP and TFB to the TATA box and BRE has been demonstrated to be of key importance for determining the directional recruitment of the archaeal RNAP to the transcription start site (9Bell S.D. Kosa P.F. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The BRE has also been identified in eucaryal RNAPII promoters as a key determinant of promoter strength (10Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 34-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In archaea, the recruitment of the RNAP appears to be via a direct interaction between TFB and the RNAP, and this requires the N-terminal zinc ribbon-containing domain of TFB (11Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In eucarya there also appears to be a direct interaction between TFIIB and RNAP II, although it is clear that contacts between TFIIB and the RNAP-associated factor TFIIF are also important for RNAP recruitment. Finally, in eucarya TFIIE and TFIIH play key roles in the late stages of transcriptional initiation and promoter clearance. In contrast, in vitrostudies performed on a range of archaeal promoters have demonstrated no requirement for analogous activities in archaea (12Bell S.D. Jaxel C. Nadal M. Kosa P.F. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15218-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the archaeal transcription system resembles those factors minimally required for RNAP II transcription. These findings suggest that the last common ancestor of the archaeal and eucaryal lineages possessed a transcription system that used TBP, TFB/TFIIB, and a complex multi-subunit RNAP, a configuration distinct from the simpler bacterial RNAP holoenzyme. Given the striking similarities between the basal transcription machineries of archaea and eucarya, it might be predicted that similar mechanisms would be employed by these organisms to effect regulated gene expression. However, it is apparent from analysis of archaeal genome sequences that archaea possess a significant number of homologues of bacterial transcriptional regulators (13Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4658-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 14Kyrpides N.C. Ouzounis C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8545-8550Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). How these “bacterial-like” regulators interface with that “eucaryal-like” basal machinery of archaea remains poorly understood. Recently, we characterized MDR1, an archaeal homologue of bacterialmetal-dependent transcriptionalregulators (15Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Experiments performed in vitroand in vivo indicated that MDR1 regulates, in a metal-dependent manner, the expression of a polycistronic transcription unit comprising its own gene and an ABC metal transporter. We showed that MDR1 does not affect promoter recognition by the general transcription factors, TBP and TFB, but effects repression by binding to the promoter downstream of the TATA box and preventing stable recruitment of the RNAP by the TBP/TFB promoter complex (15Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism of repression appears to be employed by LrpA, a Pyrococcus furiosus homologue of the bacterial Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulators. 2A. Brinkman and J. van der Oost, personal communication. A recent report described the presence of a Lrp/AsnC family member in Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 (16Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein, Lrs14, was demonstrated to specifically bind DNA upstream of its own gene. However, as the transcription start site of the gene was not determined, the role, if any, of Lrs14 in transcription remains to be established. In the current work, we demonstrate by using a reconstituted in vitro transcription system that Lrs14 negatively regulates the expression of its own gene. We also characterize the binding sites of Lrs14 and show them to overlap the TATA-box and BRE promoter elements of the Lrs14 promoter. Additionally, we reveal that Lrs14 binding prevents promoter recognition by TBP and TFB, indicating that the mechanism of transcriptional repression by Lrs14 is distinct from that employed by LrpA and MDR1. The Lrs14 gene was amplified by PCR using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and oligonucleotide primers LRS5 (5′ AAATCACGTTAACTTT 3′) and LRS3 (5′ GGAATTCCTCGAGCTTTTCTTTCAATTCTTG 3′), and the PCR product was cloned into pTOPO-XL (Invitrogen) to create pLRPRO. The PCR product was also digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the resultant fragment was ligated to NdeI/XhoI-digested pET30a, creating pET-Lrs. The Escherichia coli strain BLR RIL was transformed with pET-Lrs for expression of recombinant hexahistidine-tagged Lrs14. Cells were grown toA 600 nm of 0.4, and expression was induced with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm with growth continued for another 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in N300 (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and lysed by sonication. Following clarification by centrifugation the extract was heated to 75 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to remove denatured protein. Imidazole was added to 15 mm, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column (QIAGEN). The column was washed with 10 volumes of N300 plus 40 mm imidazole. Recombinant protein was then eluted with 5 volumes of N300 plus 500 mm imidazole, and 1-ml fractions were collected. These were assayed for the presence of Lrs14 by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 200 volumes of N300 overnight. Gel filtration was performed using a Superose 12, 3.2/20 column attached to a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min, with 40-μl fractions collected. Calibration standards were chromatographed according to the manufacturer's instructions. These assays were performed as described previously (11Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using either pLRPRO or pT6 (see Ref. 19Qureshi, S. A., Bell, S. D., and Jackson, S. P. (1997)16, 2927–2936.Google Scholar) as template. Products of in vitro transcription assays were detected by primer extension assays using radiolabeled oligonucleotide primers (T7 primer for pT6 and LRSINT 5′ GAAATTTTAGTGCGTCTAC 3′ for pLRPRO). A starter culture of S. solfataricus P2 was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (strain 1617) and grown in medium 182 at 75 °C with shaking. Cells were grown to an A 600 nm of 0.8 and harvested by centrifugation. RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). 5 μg of RNA was annealed to 1 ng of 32P-radiolabeled LRSINT, and primer extension was performed as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The products of reverse transcription were electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside a sequence ladder generated using the same oligonucleotide primer and the fmol® system (Promega). The probes for footprinting were prepared by PCR using T7 and 32P 5′-radiolabeled LRSINT oligonucleotides for studies of the transcribed strand and LRSINT and 32P 5′-radiolabeled T7 for the non-transcribed strand. The oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and γ-32P-ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The same radiolabeled primers were used to generate a dideoxynucleotide sequence ladder using the fmol® kit (Promega). DNaseI footprinting was performed as described (11Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed using annealed oligonucleotide probes as indicated in the figures under conditions described previously (15Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of S. solfataricus Lrs14 was cloned, and the 14-kDa gene product was expressed in E. coli as a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged protein (Fig.1 A). The purified protein was chromatographed over a Superose 12 gel filtration column. By reference to the elution profile of size standards, the protein was determined to have a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 1 B). This suggests that Lrs14 exists principally as a homodimer in solution. This conclusion was supported by cross-linking studies using the homobifunctional cross-linker dimethylsuberimidate (data not shown).Figure 1Purification of Lrs14, identification of its promoter, and establishment of Lrs14-dependent transcriptional repression in vitro.

Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transcription start site and, therefore, the promoter of this gene, have not been experimentally defined. To address this issue, RNA was isolated from S. solfataricus P2 in late logarithmic growth phase (A 600 = 0.8) and subjected to primer extension analysis. The product of primer extension was electrophoresed adjacent to a sequencing ladder derived using the same radiolabeled primer. The result shown in the left panel of Fig. 1 C indicates that transcription starts at the A of the ATG start codon of Lrs14. The putative promoter region of Lrs14 was then amplified by PCR and cloned into pCR-TOPO (Invitrogen) to generate pLRPRO. This plasmid was used as template in a reconstituted archaeal transcription system containing purified S. acidocaldariusRNAP and purified recombinant S. acidocaldarius TBP and TFB (11Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RNA was recovered from the reaction and subjected to primer extension analysis as above (Fig. 1 C, right panel; summarized in Fig. 1 D). In agreement with the start site detected using RNA isolated from cells, the principal start detected in this assays (shown with a black arrow in Fig.1 C, left panel and Fig. 1 D) is found at the A of the start codon for Lrs14, underlinedin Fig. 1 D. Consensus archaeal TATA-box and BRE elements, the recognition sites for TBP and TFB, respectively, are found 24–37 nucleotides upstream of the mapped start site (Fig. 1 D). Further in vitro transcription assays with theLrs14 promoter were performed in which varying amounts of recombinant Lrs14 were added. These reactions were assembled on ice prior to incubation at 70 °C to permit transcription. As can be seen in the upper panel of Fig. 1 E, Lrs14 represses transcription from its own promoter in a concentration-dependent manner. Importantly, no Lrs14-dependent inhibition of transcription was observed from a control template, that of the T6 promoter ofSulfolobus shibatae virus SSV1 (Fig.1 E, lower panel). These data indicate that Lrs14 can specifically repress transcription from its own promoter. To investigate the mechanism whereby Lrs14 mediates transcriptional repression, we sought to determine the DNA sequences recognized by Lrs14. In agreement with previous reports we found that purified Lrs14 recognized its own promoter in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (16Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least three distinct Lrs14-DNA complexes are detected (Fig.2 A). Competition experiments indicated that these complexes arise from sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions (data not shown and below). DNaseI footprinting analyses were next performed to map the binding sites of Lrs14 on theLrs14 promoter (Fig. 2 B). Notably, Lrs14 binding gave rise to extensive DNaseI footprints extending from −60 to near the start site of transcription. TBP and TFB generated a footprint encompassing the region from −15 to −40, in agreement with the positions of the TATA box and BRE predicted from the primer extension assays (Fig. 1 D). Thus, it is apparent that the binding sites of these two complexes overlap, with the TBP-TFB binding region lying entirely within the region protected by Lrs14 from DNaseI-mediated cleavage (Fig. 2 C). These data therefore suggested that Lrs14 might interfere with TATA-box and BRE recognition by TBP and TFB. To further characterize the Lrs14 binding sites a series of deleted derivatives of the Lrs14 promoter were generated and used in the EMSA with the Lrs14 protein. The results shown in Fig.3 A suggest that Lrs14 has at least two distinct binding sites within the region of the promoter protected from cleavage by DNaseI. These sites lie on either side of the TATA box and BRE. To analyze further the binding site lying between −34 and −5, linker-scanning substitutions were introduced, and the ability of these altered DNA molecules to be recognized by Lrs14 was assessed by EMSA. As seen in Fig.3 B, substitution of G residues for the natural sequences from −30 to −26 (probe F1) abrogates Lrs14 binding, whereas substitution of residues −25 to −22 (probe F2) reduces Lrs14 binding. In contrast, substitution of residues −18 to −16 (probe F3) has no significant effect on binding. The importance of the sequences from −30 to −26 is particularly noteworthy as they lie within the region of the promoter predicted to function as the TATA box. Thus, it appears that Lrs14 and TBP recognize overlapping sequence elements in the Lrs14 promoter. We tested this hypothesis by determining the ability of the TBP-TFB ternary complex to form on oligonucleotides containing the F1 substitutions. In agreement with the predicted position of the TATA box, we find that substitution of G-rich sequences at positions −30 to −26 abrogate TBP-TFB-DNA complex formation (Fig. 3 C). The transcription assays shown in Fig.1 E were set up by adding the promoter DNA to a reaction already containing Lrs14, TBP, TFB, and RNAP. Given the overlap detected above between the sequences involved in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and Lrs14 binding, we decided to test whether Lrs14 was able to disrupt a pre-formed PIC. Accordingly, order of addition transcription experiments were performed in which PIC was formed by addition of TBP, TFB, and RNAP to template DNA for varying time periods prior to challenge with Lrs14 (Fig. 4 A). Nucleoside triphosphates were then added to initiate transcription, and yields of transcript were detected by primer extension. The results of this assay (Fig. 4 A) indicate that if the PIC is formed prior to addition of Lrs14 then no repression of transcription occurs. In contrast, if Lrs14 is added at the same time as or prior to PIC formation then transcription is strongly repressed. These data therefore suggest that, although Lrs14 is unable to displace the PIC from DNA, the converse is also true; PIC components cannot displace Lrs14 from the promoter. Identical results were obtained when unfractionated extract prepared from S. solfataricus P2 was used as a source of basal transcription factors and RNAP (data not shown). To investigate the competition between Lrs14 and the PIC further, DNaseI footprinting assays were performed to determine whether there was any competition between DNA binding by TBP/TFB and by Lrs14. Binding reactions were performed in which radiolabeled probe was pre-incubated with either TBP/TFB or Lrs14 for varying lengths of time. Following this pre-incubation, the TFB/TBP reactions were supplemented with Lrs14, and the Lrs14 reactions had TBP/TFB added. Notably, neither Lrs14 nor TBP/TFB could supplant the opposing factor-DNA complex, indicating that both complexes are stable and resistant to challenge (Fig. 4 B). Similar results were obtained with EMSAs performed on reactions in which Lrs14 had been added to reactions containing either naked DNA or pre-formed TBP/TFB-DNA complexes (Fig.4 C). At the various time points indicated in Fig.4 C, reactions were loaded on a running polyacrylamide gel. As can be seen in Fig. 4 C, even following a 30-min challenge with Lrs14, there is no significant reduction in the amount of TBP/TFB-DNA ternary complex. Thus, these experiments indicate that TBP/TFB-DNA recognition and Lrs14-DNA complex formation are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, in stark contrast to results obtained with the archaeal transcriptional repressor MDR1 (15Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), there is no evidence of higher order complexes containing TBP/TFB and Lrs14 co-bound to the same DNA molecule. Previous work has identified Lrs14 as a protein that binds upstream of its own open reading frame (16Napoli A. van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M. Ciaramella M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that the Lrs14 binding sites actually overlap the basal promoter elements important for mediating Lrs14 gene transcription. Moreover, we present evidence that Lrs14 autoregulates its own expression by controlling the accessibility of the TATA box and BRE of the Lrs14 gene to the basal transcription factors, TBP and TFB. This mode of transcriptional repression by Lrs14 is highly distinct from that mediated by the archaeal metal-dependent repressor, MDR1, which binds to consecutive operators downstream of the TATA box, allowing TBP and TFB to bind to the core promoter elements but blocking the subsequent recruitment of RNAP by the TBP-TFB promoter ternary complex (15Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the different mechanisms of repression by MDR1 and Lrs14 reflect the differing biological roles of the genes that they regulate. In the case of MDR1 it regulates expression of a polycistronic transcription unit containing its own gene and a metal-importing ABC transporter system. By having TBP and TFB pre-bound to the promoter, the system is poised to rapidly recruit RNAP and initiate transcription in response to decreases in intracellular metal ion concentration. This ability to respond rapidly may be of crucial importance when the cell needs to maintain suitable levels of vital metal ion co-factors despite constantly changing environmental conditions. In the case of Lrs14, the protein is autoregulating expression of a monocistronic transcription unit containing only its own gene. Although the biology of Lrs14 is currently less clear, our data suggest that the cell does not need to mount a rapid response to regulate levels of the Lrs14 protein. It is tempting to speculate that downstream targets of Lrs14 may be regulated by a mechanism akin to MDR1 regulation. Our current work adds to the evidence that regulation of archaeal gene expression is mediated by molecules that are generally more closely related to bacterial than to eucaryal transcriptional repressors. Indeed, a recent analysis indicates that the abundance of genes encoding predicted bacterial-like transcriptional regulators in archaeal genomes is roughly equivalent to those in bacterial genomes (13Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4658-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). For example, 3.5 and 2% of the predicted open reading frames of the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus and the bacteriumAquifex aeolicus, respectively, contain bacterial-like helix turn helix motifs (13Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4658-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As this class of regulators is found in both archaeal and bacterial domains, we shall refer to these molecules as bacterial-archaeal (BA) regulators. The presence of BA regulators in both domains could in part reflect lateral gene transfer events having taken place between bacteria and archaea. However, the extent of the similarity between the BA regulators in the two domains is more consistent with a second interpretation, that the BA regulators were established prior to the divergence of these two lineages. This possibility would account for the existence of archaeal-specific families of helix turn helix-containing factors that are nonetheless more closely related to bacterial than eucaryal helix turn helix-containing factors (13Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4658-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is widely accepted that the divergence of eucaryal and archaeal lineages occurred following the divergence of the bacteria (17Woese C. Fox G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5088-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (2497) Google Scholar). An important inference from the above proposal is therefore that the last common ancestor of archaea and eucarya possessed a transcription machinery with a basal apparatus akin to that found in present day archaea combined with BA-type regulators. If this is correct, then it raises the question of why there is a paucity of BA-type regulators in eucarya. An attractive explanation is that as the eucarya evolved ever-increasing genome size and the consequential requirement for higher order DNA compaction systems, the generally repressive role of chromatin became more and more dominant. There may then have been considerable pressure for eucarya to develop novel chromatin-modulatory systems. This may have led to the loss of the simple BA regulators and their replacement by the present eucaryal system in which transcriptional regulation and chromatin modification are inextricably interwoven (18Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Clearly, further investigations into the biological roles and mechanisms of actions of archaeal, bacterial, and eucaryal transcriptional regulators will shed light on the evolution of gene regulatory processes.

https://openalex.org/W2166974541,"To define aspects of lipid composition and bilayer asymmetry critical to barrier function, we examined the permeabilities of liposomes that model individual leaflets of the apical membrane of a barrier epithelium, Madin-Darby canine kidney type 1 cells. Using published lipid compositions we prepared exofacial liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol; and cytoplasmic liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol. The osmotic permeability of cytoplasmic liposomes to water (Pf ), solutes, and NH3 was 18–90-fold higher than for the exofacial liposomes (Pf(ex) = 2.4 ± 0.4 × 10−4 cm/s, Pf(cy) = 4.4 ± 0.3 × 10−3 cm/s;Pglycerol(ex) = 2.5 ± 0.3 × 10−8 cm/s,Pglycerol(cy) = 2.2 ± 0.02 × 10−6 cm/s; PNH3(ex) = 0.13 ± 0.4 × 10−4 cm/s,PNH3(cy) = 7.9 ± 1.0 × 10−3cm/s). By contrast, the apparent proton permeability of exofacial liposomes was 4-fold higher than cytoplasmic liposomes (PH+(ex) = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 10−2 cm/s, PH+(cy) = 2.7 ± 0.6 × 10−3 cm/s). By adding single leaflet permeabilities, we calculated a theoretical Pf for a Madin-Darby canine kidney apical membrane of 4.6 × 10−4 cm/s, which compares favorably with experimentally determined values. In exofacial liposomes lacking glycosphingolipids or sphingomyelin, permeabilities were 2–7-fold higher, indicating that both species play a role in barrier function. Removal of cholesterol resulted in 40–280-fold increases in permeability. We conclude: 1) that we have reconstituted the biophysical properties of a barrier membrane, 2) that the barrier resides in the exofacial leaflet, 3) that both sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids play a role in reducing membrane permeability but that there is an absolute requirement for cholesterol to mediate this effect, 4) that these results further validate the hypothesis that each leaflet offers an independent resistance to permeation, and 5) that proton permeation was enhanced by sphingolipid/cholesterol interactions. To define aspects of lipid composition and bilayer asymmetry critical to barrier function, we examined the permeabilities of liposomes that model individual leaflets of the apical membrane of a barrier epithelium, Madin-Darby canine kidney type 1 cells. Using published lipid compositions we prepared exofacial liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol; and cytoplasmic liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol. The osmotic permeability of cytoplasmic liposomes to water (Pf ), solutes, and NH3 was 18–90-fold higher than for the exofacial liposomes (Pf(ex) = 2.4 ± 0.4 × 10−4 cm/s, Pf(cy) = 4.4 ± 0.3 × 10−3 cm/s;Pglycerol(ex) = 2.5 ± 0.3 × 10−8 cm/s,Pglycerol(cy) = 2.2 ± 0.02 × 10−6 cm/s; PNH3(ex) = 0.13 ± 0.4 × 10−4 cm/s,PNH3(cy) = 7.9 ± 1.0 × 10−3cm/s). By contrast, the apparent proton permeability of exofacial liposomes was 4-fold higher than cytoplasmic liposomes (PH+(ex) = 1.1 ± 0.1 × 10−2 cm/s, PH+(cy) = 2.7 ± 0.6 × 10−3 cm/s). By adding single leaflet permeabilities, we calculated a theoretical Pf for a Madin-Darby canine kidney apical membrane of 4.6 × 10−4 cm/s, which compares favorably with experimentally determined values. In exofacial liposomes lacking glycosphingolipids or sphingomyelin, permeabilities were 2–7-fold higher, indicating that both species play a role in barrier function. Removal of cholesterol resulted in 40–280-fold increases in permeability.

In contrast to this, there are certain cells and tissues, which, for functional reasons, exhibit exceedingly low permeabilities (1Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F243-F245PubMed Google Scholar). These include the urinary bladder, which must maintain strikingly high concentration gradients for urea, NH3, protons, and CO2, when compared with the blood and surrounding interstitium (2Negrete H.O. Lavelle J.P. Berg J. Lewis S.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F886-F894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the stomach, the secretions of which have an extremely low pH; and the collecting duct in the kidney, which separates the urine being formed from the interstitium (1Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F243-F245PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar). Failure of the cell to maintain these barriers can lead to significant human pathology including renal tubular disorders, peptic ulcer disease, and cystitis (4Lavelle J.P. Apodaca G. Meyers S.A. Ruiz W.G. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F205-F214PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lavelle J.P. Meyers S.A. Ruiz W.G. Buffington C.A.T. Zeidel M.L. Apodaca G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F540-F553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The features of the lumenal surface that confer these remarkable properties are currently unclear, although it is now accepted that the barrier to permeation resides in the apical membrane of the superficial epithelial cells (3Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lewis S.A. Eaton D.C. Clausen C. Diamond J.M. J. Gen.

Early physiological studies of mammalian bladder demonstrated an extremely high transepithelial resistance of up to 78,000 ohms cm2 (11Lewis S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: F187-F195PubMed Google Scholar), and electrode impalement studies of the various epithelial cell layers demonstrated that the apical membrane of the most superficial layer was the location of the high electrical resistance (8Lewis S.A. Hanrahan J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 192: 632-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Lewis S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: F187-F195PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lewis S.A. de Moura J.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 82: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Creation of that barrier appears to depend on the cell's ability to synthesize an asymmetric bilayer,i.e. to apportion different lipid constituents to the outer or exofacial leaflet compared with the inner or cytoplasmic leaflet, and then to restrict the intermingling of those lipids (13Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). An earlier study from our laboratory demonstrated the functional consequences of losing bilayer asymmetry, when gastric apical vesicles, which possessed exceptionally low permeabilities to water, protons, and non-electrolytes, were made symmetrical by quantitative lipid extraction and reconstitution into liposomes. The newly formed liposomes, although made from identical apical membrane lipids, exhibited much higher permeabilities than the native membrane (10Lande M.B. Priver N.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C367-C374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bilayer asymmetry is maintained by tight junctions between cells that not only isolate the basolateral and apical membranes, but also the exofacial leaflet from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane (14van Meer G. Gumbiner B. Simons K. Nature. 1986; 322: 639-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15van Meer G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Thus, by means of lipid sorting in the trans-Golgi network and vectorial delivery of lipids to specific membrane domains, the cell can erect a membrane with low permeability. The precise structural features responsible for barrier function are unclear; however, it appears that certain combinations of lipids result in a more highly ordered membrane that has lower permeabilities for water and non-electrolytes. For example, sphingomyelin (SM)1 and cholesterol have been shown to associate closely due to van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, and these interactions induce tight packing in the bilayer (16Bittman R. Kasireddy C.R. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11776-11781Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We, and others have previously shown that MDCK type 1 cells grown on permeable supports exhibit the permeability properties of a barrier epithelium (17Lavelle J.P. Negrete H.O. Poland P.A. Kinlough C.L. Meyers S.D. Hughey R.P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F67-F75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the lipid structure of the MDCK cell apical membrane is well defined, we aimed to reconstitute the low permeability properties of the MDCK type 1 cell, in an effort to understand the determinants that contribute significantly to this membrane's barrier properties (17Lavelle J.P. Negrete H.O. Poland P.A. Kinlough C.L. Meyers S.D. Hughey R.P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F67-F75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also wished to further validate our earlier findings that each leaflet in a phospholipid bilayer offers an independent resistance to permeation (18Negrete H.O. Rivers R.L. Goughs A.H. Colombini M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11627-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This hypothesis can be summarized by the following equation, in which the resistance offered by each leaflet is equivalent to the reciprocal of the permeability. 1PAB=1PA+1PBEquation 1 PAB is the permeability of a bilayer composed of leaflets A and B, PA is the permeability of leaflet A, and PB is the permeability of leaflet B. We have exploited this property in attempting to recreate the MDCK apical membrane: an asymmetric bilayer. Accordingly, we constructed liposomes with particular combinations of lipids in order to mimic the exofacial leaflet and the cytoplasmic leaflet of MDCK cells, and then measured their permeabilities to water, non-electrolytes, protons, and NH3. The cytoplasmic leaflets had dramatically higher permeabilities than the exofacial liposomes (20–90-fold depending on the permeant). By the use of Equation 1, we derived a theoretical water permeability for the MDCK apical membrane that correlates extremely well with published permeabilities. Further experiments aimed at identifying the lipids responsible for barrier function implicate sphingolipid/cholesterol interactions as a key determinant in the formation of low permeability membranes.DISCUSSIONWe have used published data on the lipid composition of MDCK type 1 apical membranes and in addition made a number of simplifying assumptions regarding its bilayer asymmetry, in order to construct vesicles that mimic each leaflet's composition. This analysis predicts that the apical membrane of these cells is comprised of an asymmetric bilayer, which is enriched in SM, GSLs, and PC in the exofacial leaflet, whereas the inner leaflet is composed mostly of the glycerophospholipids, PE, PS, and PI (Table I). Evidence to support these conclusions has come from a number of studies. For instance, in brush border membranes from rabbit intestine, it was shown that PE phospholipid was largely inaccessible to reagents from the outside (31Barsukov L.I. Bergelson L.D. Spiess M. Hauser H. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 862: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A similar accessibility study of rabbit kidney brush border membranes revealed that PE, PS, and PI were localized to the inner leaflet, whereas SM was external (32Venien C. Le Grimellec C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 942: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells a fluorescent ceramide analogue, which was taken up and converted to SM and GSL in the Golgi, was completely extractable by bovine serum albumin from the apical side, demonstrating a preferential accumulation in the exofacial leaflet (25van Meer G. Stelzer E.H.K. Wijnaendts-van Resandt R.W. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The predicted asymmetry also fits with well established rules, which indicate that choline-containing lipids are mostly exofacial, whereas the amino-containing phospholipids localize cytoplasmically (33Op den Kamp J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is present in both leaflets and was apportioned according to the quantitative analyses described in the reference papers (15van Meer G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1455-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 23Hansson G.C. Simons K. van Meer G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).Because the lipids of the exofacial leaflet of polarized epithelia are laterally constrained by the presence of tight junctions, whereas the lipids of the cytoplasmic leaflet are not, the inner leaflet of the apical domain is assumed to be the same as that of the basolateral membrane (13Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 34van Meer G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it appears likely that the barrier function exhibited by “water-tight” epithelia resides in the exofacial leaflet. Present studies directly tested this hypothesis and confirmed its validity. For water, small non-electrolytes, and NH3, all substances known to cross phospholipid bilayers by a “solubility-diffusion” mechanism, the permeability of the cytoplasmic leaflet was 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the exofacial. These data indicated that the presence of appropriate lipids present in defined ratios was sufficient to generate a membrane with extremely low permeability to water, solutes, and NH3. Moreover, these experiments have allowed us to quantitate the magnitude of that difference in leaflet permeabilities for a range of biologically relevant permeant molecules.For water, the cytoplasmic leaflet liposomes were 18 times more permeable than the exofacial with osmotic permeability coefficients of 4.4 × 10−3 cm/s and 2.4 × 10−4 cm/s, respectively. We have previously shown that each leaflet is able to offer an independent resistance to permeation (18Negrete H.O. Rivers R.L. Goughs A.H. Colombini M. Zeidel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11627-11630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By analogy with electrical circuit theory, resistance is equal to the reciprocal of the permeability,i.e. R = 1/Pf (see Eq. 1). As our exofacial and cytoplasmic liposomes have symmetrical leaflets, knowing the membrane permeability of each bilayer allows us to calculate single leaflet permeabilities according to Equation 1. Combining the derived value for an exofacial leaflet and a cytoplasmic leaflet gave us a theoretical osmotic permeability coefficient (Pf ) of 4.6 × 10−4 cm/s, which correlates well with the measured permeability of this membrane in cultured MDCK type 1 cells. Such close concordance of measured and theoretical values as determined by our model system argues that the assumptions made and the lipid compositions arrived at are probably reasonable representations of the real membrane and allow us to conclude that the outer leaflet of the MDCK type 1 apical membrane is probably 20-fold less permeable to water than the inner leaflet. These results also successfully apply Equation1 to membranes of real cells for the first time.Although we based our leaflet compositions on the best evidence available, there is little information known about the acyl chain composition of these various lipid classes in the MDCK apical membrane. Consequently, we chose mammalian lipids as the source for these experiments in an attempt to minimize artifacts that may have arisen from the use of bacterial or other lipid sources. Based on information provided by Avanti Polar Lipids, we know the acyl chain composition of our artificial membranes (see Supplemental Material available on-line). As expected the saturation ratio (i.e. saturated:unsaturated (S:U)) was quite different between the two membranes. Exofacial membranes had an S:U of 2.5 due to the presence of saturated acyl chains on SM and GSL. In contrast, cytoplasmic membranes had an S:U of 0.6, indicating a much higher proportion of double bond-containing fatty acids. Exofacial membranes contained high proportions of 16:0 (35.0%), 18:0 (8.1%), and 24:0 (16.4%) acyl chains. The predominant unsaturated acyl chains were 18:1 and 18:2 (11.1%) and 24:1 (8.4%). In comparison to this, the cytoplasmic membranes contained little 16:0 with the predominant saturated species being 18:0 (34.1%). Unsaturated chains were 18:1 (12.3%), 18:2 (12.3%), and 20:4 (27.1%). The acyl chain composition of these membranes is likely to be an important contributor to their permeation properties due to the different packing constraints imposed by the presence of double bonds. Double bonds introduce a rigid bend in an acyl chain, resulting in greater free volume space and higher fluidity in the membrane. It has been shown previously, for substances that cross membranes by a solubility-diffusion mechanism, that membrane fluidity and permeability are tightly correlated (20Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The results presented here further support this principle.We investigated the effect of using lipids with different fatty acid substituents. The use of disaturated DPPC in an exofacial membrane reduced the membrane permeability but more surprisingly appeared to substitute for GSLs upon their removal by maintaining low permeability. At 25οC DPPC is in the gel state and with a phosphocholine head group strongly resembles SM. Although there is no amide group for hydrogen bonding with cholesterol, the tight chain packing induced by cholesterol and saturated PC in the gel state appears sufficient to compensate for loss of GSLs. It is therefore extremely important that the most physiologically relevant lipids are used in membrane modeling studies. Clearly the complement of unsaturated acyl chains is an important determinant in the permeation properties of the membrane.To further examine the validity of our leaflet-specific liposomes as a model for predicting reconstituted membrane permeabilities, it is informative to compare our results with permeabilities found in other barrier epithelia. Our theoretical MDCK membrane permeability to urea (employing Equation 1) is 6.2 × 10−8cm/s. This compares to values of 2.1 × 10−7 cm/s (3-fold higher), 7.8 × 10−7 cm/s (13-fold higher), and 5.5 × 10−7 cm/s (9-fold higher) for toad bladder apical membrane, mammalian bladder apical membrane, and gastric apical membrane, respectively (3Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our reconstituted membrane system has a urea permeability approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than that seen for some other barrier membranes. We have, in addition, previously measured the diffusive urea permeability of MDCK cells to be 6.0 × 10−6 cm/s (17Lavelle J.P. Negrete H.O. Poland P.A. Kinlough C.L. Meyers S.D. Hughey R.P. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F67-F75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than is seen for other barrier epithelia, and 2 orders of magnitude higher than our model liposomes would predict for this membrane. We believe this may indicate some form of facilitated urea uptake by MDCK cells. To the best of our knowledge, urea transport activity has not specifically been demonstrated in MDCKs; however, it is possible that cells derived from the distal nephron would possess such an activity. Further support for this conjecture comes from permeability studies performed by Rivers et al. (27Rivers R.L. McAteer J.A. Clendenon J.L. Connors B.A. Williams J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C226-C234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which they measured the acetamide and formamide permeabilities of MDCK apical membranes to be 4.1 × 10−6 and 5.5 × 10−6 cm/s, respectively. The theoretical permeabilities for these two non-electrolytes as derived from our model liposomes was 3.8 × 10−6 and 5.5 × 10−6 cm/s, respectively, which are in very close agreement. Furthermore, liposomes composed of 25% SM, 40% cholesterol, and 35% PC have been shown to have a urea permeability of 4.4 × 10−8 cm/s (20Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which is close to the value obtained for the exofacial liposomes used in this study (3.1 × 10−8 cm/s with a composition of 25% SM, 39% cholesterol, 36% PC and GSLs). Taken together these results indicate that urea permeability may be facilitated in MDCK cells and not reflect simple membrane permeant behavior. Measurements of water and other solutes, however, appear to validate our hypothesis and the use of Equation 1 to predict apical membrane permeability properties.The theoretical MDCK membrane permeability to NH3 is 2.6 × 10−4 cm/s, which is within an order of magnitude of values measured for other barrier epithelia (3Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar). The proton permeability for our artificial membrane was 4.3 × 10−3 cm/s, which compares favorably with values of 8.0 × 10−3 cm/s, 3.0 × 10−3 cm/s, and 19 × 10−3 cm/s, obtained for medullary thick ascending limb apical membrane, whole mammalian bladder, and gastric apical membrane, respectively (3Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar). These comparisons between our in vitro reconstituted membranes and real asymmetric barrier membranes lend support to the conclusion that these artificial liposomes reconstitute the biophysical characteristics of true barrier membranes to a wide range of biologically important permeant molecules.We performed measurements of proton permeation that relied upon the dissipation of an applied pH gradient across the liposomal membrane with consequent quenching of an intravesicular pH-dependent fluorophore. Although this is a well established technique for monitoring proton permeation processes (3Rivers R. Blanchard A. Eladari D. Leviel F. Paillard M. Podevin R.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lande M.B. Priver N.A. Zeidel M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C367-C374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J.

A. 1983; 80: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism is not well understood. Measurements of proton permeability can yield very different values depending on the method used. If small pH gradients are allowed to dissipate around pH 7, values in the range of 10−4 cm/s are obtained (35Nichols J.W. Deamer D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2038-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, if large pH gradients are applied to liposomes, proton fluxes with values of 10−9 cm/s are recorded (36Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4324-4328Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was explored by Deamer and Nichols (37Deamer D.W. Nichols J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and led them to conclude that decay of large pH gradients results in diffusion potentials that limit proton flux. Addition of valinomycin in K+-containing buffers eliminated the formation of membrane potentials and therefore allowed proton fluxes to become rate-limiting. However, if proton fluxes were measured near pH 7 in the presence of small proton gradients, there was no formation of a limiting diffusion potential (37Deamer D.W. Nichols J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our experiments were carried out under the latter conditions, and as noted by Deamer and Nichols, the presence or absence of valinomycin did not affect the rate of proton flux. Although this indicates our measurements were not influenced by the formation of membrane potentials, it does appear to contradict rules of electroneutrality. Given that we cannot rule out that our proton flux may be accompanied by some other charge-dissipating process i.e. proton-anion co-permeation, we have chosen to refer to these measurements as demonstrating the apparent proton permeability of the liposomal membranes.Our measurements of proton permeability in cytoplasmic and exofacial membranes yielded the unusual result that cytoplasmic lipids had 4-fold lower proton permeability than the exofacial (Fig. 8). The mechanism by which protons translocate across phospholipid bilayers is not well understood, but it has clearly been established that, unlike water, solutes, and NH3, membrane fluidity is not a key determinant in permeation (19Hill W.G. Rivers R.L. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen.

In a study that examined the relationship between membrane fluidity and permeability, it was found that liposomes of differing composition and fluidities exhibited water permeabilities that varied up to 70-fold, whereas proton permeability varied no more than 3-fold. Moreover, within that 3-fold range, there was poor correlation between proton permeability and the fluidity of the membrane (20Lande M.B. Donovan J.M. Zeidel M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Another set of experiments performed on DPPC liposomes revealed that protons permeated 4 times faster when the liposomes were heated above the phase-transition temperature, but that solute fluxes under the same conditions increased by 2 orders of magnitude (19Hill W.G.

Acta. 1997; 1330: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that liposomes made from phospholipids extracted from the mitochondrial inner membrane of eight different vertebrate species, with widely varying mitochondrial proton leak and degree of acyl chain unsaturation exhibited no differences in proton permeability. They concluded there was no correlation between liposome proton permeability and phospholipid fatty acid composition. The data presented here further support this. When cholesterol was removed from the exofacial membrane, water permeability increased nearly 40-fold. In dramatic contrast to this, proton permeability decreased 6.5-fold.Proton permeation across membranes has been shown to occur at rates 5–6 orders of magnitude higher than for other monovalent cations. Several explanations have been proposed to account for this anomalous behavior. The first hypothesizes the presence of fatty acid “contaminants” within the membrane that are available for protonation. The protonated species translocates to the other side, releases a proton, and then cycles back as the anionic species (39Gutknecht J. J. Bioenerg.

Those Na+ efflux systems which are secondary active transport systems are dominated thus far by Na+/H+antiporters (3Padan, E., and Krulwich, T. A. (2000) in Bacterial Stress Responses, eds. Storz, G.& Hengge-Aronis, R., (ASM Press), pp. 117–130Google Scholar, 4Padan E. Schuldiner S. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J. The Handbook of Biological Physics. II. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1996: 501-531Google Scholar). They are energized by the electrochemical proton gradient, Δp1, that is produced by distinct redox-, light-, or ATP-driven proton extrusion systems (5West I.C. Mitchell P Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Harold F.M. The Vital Force: A Study of Bioenergetics. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1986: 57-90Google Scholar). These antiporters sometimes catalyze efflux of Li+ and/or K+ in addition to Na+and thus can have a role in Li+ resistance and K+ homeostasis, respectively, as well as in Na+resistance (7Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Na+/H+ antiporters can support net accumulation of H+ when the coupling ratio of H+/Na+ is greater than unity (8MacNab R.M. Castle A.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Accordingly, they can also contribute importantly to pH homeostasis when cells are growing in alkaline media (7Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1185: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 9Krulwich T.A. Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. J. Exp.

John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., Chichester UK1999: 167-182Google Scholar). However, reliance on these mechanisms makes these important stress responses vulnerable to conditions in which the Δp is low, i.e. at which the driving force for the secondary antiporters is reduced. At the level of amino acid sequence and likely structural category, the secondary Na+/H+ antiporters reported to date are all distinct from one another except for orthologues, which are simply closely related gene products in different organisms (3Padan, E., and Krulwich, T. A. (2000) in Bacterial Stress Responses, eds. Storz, G.& Hengge-Aronis, R., (ASM Press), pp. 117–130Google Scholar). The diversity of the proteins that catalyze Na+/H+antiport indicates that there is flexibility in the structures that can support this particular transport function and in some instances reflects a capacity for transporting additional substrates (3Padan, E., and Krulwich, T. A. (2000) in Bacterial Stress Responses, eds. Storz, G.& Hengge-Aronis, R., (ASM Press), pp. 117–130Google Scholar, 9Krulwich T.A. Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 457-470PubMed Google Scholar). The current study focuses on two paralogous Bacillus subtilisgenes whose deduced products both have strong sequence similarity to the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaC. NhaC was first described in alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 (formerly B. firmus OF4 (11Takami H. Krulwich T.A. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) (12Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Bossewitch J.S. Padan E. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

In that organism, NhaC appears to be one of the relatively high affinity Na+/H+ antiporters with a role in pH homeostasis at high pH and low [Na+] but no evident role in resistance to growth inhibition by elevated Na+ (13Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the two homologous B. subtilis genes,yheL and yqkI, was recently examined in tetA(L) deletion mutants of B. subtilis to ascertain whether their up-regulation might occur upon loss of the Na+/H+ antiporter function of multifunctional TetA(L) (14Wang W. Guffanti A.A. Wei Y. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression of one of these genes, yheL, was indeed up-regulated. In addition, B. subtilis mutants deleted in yheL had a phenotype consistent with YheL being an NhaC-type of Na+/H+ antiporter. The experiments reported here were subsequently undertaken to confirm that YheL indeed catalyzed this exchange and to probe the possibility that the product of the other paralogue, yqkI, whose expression was not up-regulated, might catalyze a different, novel exchange. The genomic context of yqkI provided an interesting clue to such an alternative exchange. The yqkI gene is in an apparent operon with yqkJ. The strongly predicted product of yqkJ in BLAST (15Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) analyses is a malolactate enzyme. The malolactate enzymes of lactic acid bacteria catalyze the formation of lactate and carbon dioxide from malate, with the consumption of a cytoplasmic proton (16Caspritz G. Radler F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4907-4910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Llokema J.S. Poolman B.P. Konings W.N. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The malolactate enzyme, together with a transporter (or two separate transporters) that exchanges the external precursor (malate) for the product of the malolactate enzyme (lactate), comprise malolactate fermentation (MLF) (18Olsen E.B. Russell J.B. Henick-Kling T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6199-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1997; 71: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MLF plays an important role in determining the acidity of wine (20Kunkee R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 88: 55-72Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 21Davis C.R. Wibowo D. Fleet G.H. Lee T.H. Am. J. Enol. Vitic. 1988; 39: 137-142Google Scholar, 22Henick-Kling T. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1995; 79: 29-37SGoogle Scholar). The basis for energy conservation for the bacteria that carry out the MLF pathway depends in part on the consumption of the cytoplasmic proton, so that a net ΔpH, acid outside, results (17Llokema J.S. Poolman B.P. Konings W.N. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Depending on the details of substrate and product exchange, energy conservation may be further enhanced (18Olsen E.B. Russell J.B. Henick-Kling T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6199-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Bolhuis H. van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M.

Ansanay V. Rachidi N. Dequin S. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18140-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The deduced yqkI product does not resemble the malolactate exchange transporters or malate transporters that have been described in association with malolactate enzymes in fermentative bacteria (24Bandell M.

The current study was designed to test the possibility that in fact YqkI is a novel transporter that combines Na+/H+ and malate/lactate antiports in a malate-proton/Na-lactate exchange. Comparisons were carried out on the YheL-, YqkI-, and YufR-mediated transport activities in cells of a malate-minus Escherichia coli strain and in membrane vesicles from a Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient E. coli strain. YufR is a distinct B. subtilistransport protein of unconfirmed function that was strongly predicted by both sequence and context to encode a Na+/malate symporter and hence was developed as a positive control for some of the experiments. The results support the expected catalytic properties for YheL and YufR and support the proposal that YqkI is a new structural type of malate/lactate antiporter that has novel ion coupling properties, i.e. coupling Na+ efflux and H+ uptake to the substrate-product antiport. Because the concentration gradients of the organic acid substrate and product could drive the coupled antiport, this combined exchange could be less vulnerable to reductions in the Δp such as those accompanying increased cell densities or encounters with protonophoric agents. Studies of a mutant in which yqkI was disrupted support this hypothesis. Three E. colistrains were used in this study: E. coli strain DH5a (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for initial cloning work; E. coli EP432 (27Pinner E. Kotler V. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a Na+/H+-antiporter-deficient strain; and E. coli CBT312 (28Lo T.Y.C. Rayman M.K. Sanwal B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6323-6331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is deficient in malic acid transport. The E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in the media described in connection with specific experiments. Two strains of B. subtilis were employed, the wild type, BD99 strain obtained from A. Garro, and the VK3 strain constructed as part of this study. The cells were grown at 37 °C in Spizizen salts medium with either glucose or malate as the major carbon source, as described previously (14Wang W. Guffanti A.A. Wei Y. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The plasmid constructs were made by cloning PCR products into shuttle vector pBK36 (obtained from K. Zen). The primers and sites used for cloning the genes are listed in Table I. The various plasmids are designated pBK36 (control plasmid), pYqkI, pYqkJ, pYqkIJ, pYufR, and pYheL.Table IOligonucleotides used in this studyGene(s) clonedPrimer usedSequence1-aThe restriction enzyme sites are underlined.Sits in vector usedyqkIyqkI-R15′-AGTGATCCTCCAAGCTTAGCCTAGTT-3′EcoR,ClaIyqkI-F15′-GAAGGGGGAGGATCCATGAAGGATGTAAG-3′yqkJyqkI-BF15′-AGCGGATCCATGATAGCGAAACACATGAT-3′BamHI,ClaIyqkJ-CR15′-GAAGGGGGAGGATCCATGAAGGATGTAAG-3′yqkIJyqkI-R15′-AGTGATCCTCCAAGCTTAGCCTAGTT-3′EcoR,ClaIyqkJ-CR15′-GAAGGGGGAGGATCCATGAAGGATGTAAG-3′yufRyufR-S15′-ATCGCGTCGACATGGGAGCAATTCCAAAAACGGGGAC-3′SalI,BamHIyufR-B1′5′-ATGCGGATCCTTATGAAGTGAAAAAACGAAGCAGCAC-3′yheLyheL-BF15′-ATGCGGATCCATGGATTCTCAAAAAAAGCTGACG-3′BamHI,HindIIIyheL-HR15′-AGCAAGCTTATTTTTTAACAAATCCAATC-3′1-a The restriction enzyme sites are underlined. Open table in a new tab The complementation of E. coli EP432 by the different plasmid constructs was tested as described previously (29Guffanti A.A. Cheng J. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26447-26454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in LBK medium (30Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), supplemented with various concentrations of NaCl. In some experiments 50% LBK plus either 50 mm potassium malate or glucose was used. Complementation of E. coli CBT312 for growth on malate was tested in two ways. In one protocol, LT medium (26Kawai S. Suzuki H. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4056-4060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containingl-malate and bromcresol blue was used to detect the consumption of l-malate by the appearance of a deep blue color. In other experiments, M9 minimal medium (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar), with eitherl-malate or glucose as sole carbon source, was used for complementation studies. In some experiments, potassium was substituted for the sodium salts in M9 medium. RSO membrane vesicles were prepared by the method of Kaback (33Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar) by shocking spheroplasts in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, plus 2 mmMgSO4. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared, as described by others (34Ambudkar S.V. Zlotnick G.W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6142-6146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in either 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. For some reactions, the vesicles were preloaded by incubating for 18 h at 4 °C with the appropriate substrate. Transport of various radioactive substrates was assayed, by filtration, as described elsewhere (29Guffanti A.A. Cheng J. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26447-26454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (35Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.H. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using lysozyme as the standard. A mutant strain of B. subtilis was constructed in which yqkI was disrupted with a SpR cassette with its own promoter. PCR was performed on purified B. subtilis BD99 chromosomal DNA by using primers YqkIUP and YqkIDN that were contained within the yqkI gene. YqkIUP (5′-CAAACCAGGTATCGCAGGGAAAGA-3′) corresponded to base pairs 265255–265278 of the data base entry (GenBank™ accession numberD84432). YqkIDN (5′-TACCGTCTCCACTTCACCAATATCC-3′) corresponded to base pairs 266899–266867 of the same data base entry. The purified PCR product was first ligated into HincII-digested pGEM11zf(+) (ApR; Promega). The recombinant plasmid was selected by blue/white screening in E. coli DH5a. After isolation, the yqkI fragment was digested with PmlI, and a gene encoding SpR was ligated to this linear plasmid, resulting in a recombinant plasmid containing a fragment of yqkIdisrupted by the SpR gene (yqkI::SpR). After isolation, the plasmid was introduced into B. subtilis BD99 by competent cell transformation. Transformed cells were resistant to Sp (150 μg/ml). Both Southern hybridization and PCR analyses confirmed that the gene disruption event had taken place in the candidates. The yqkI-disrupted strain was designated VK3. Initial studies were directed toward determining whether YufR was indeed a Na+/malate symporter by determining whether the gene product catalyzed Na+-dependent uptake of malate and malate-dependent uptake of Na+. RSO membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli strains EP432 and CBT312 expressing either the control plasmid pBK36 or pYufR. The vesicles were pretreated with 10 mm KCN, which was also present in the assay medium, to inhibit Δp-dependent fluxes of malate or Na+. As shown in Fig.1, substantial uptake of radiolabeled malate occurred in YufR vesicles of E. coli EP432 in the presence of Na+ but not in the control vesicles or in the absence of the Na+ gradient. As shown in Fig.2, uptake of Na+ by KCN-treated RSO vesicles of E. coli CBT312/pBK36 was modest and somewhat greater in the absence than in the presence of malate. By contrast, vesicles prepared from E. coli CBT312/pYufR exhibited substantial malate-dependent uptake of22Na+. Taken together, these results supported the expectation that YufR is a Na+/malate symporter and would be an appropriate positive control in complementation experiments with a malate-minus E. coli strain.Figure 2The effect of an inwardly directed malic acid gradient on 22Na+ uptake by RSO membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli CBT312 transformed with plasmid pBK36 or pYufR. The vesicles were treated and assayed in the presence of KCN as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The vesicles were diluted into a reaction mixture, at pH 7.5, containing 500 μm22NaCl (10 μCi/ml), with or without 20 μml-malic acid, and assayed as in Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although not shown, only YqkIJ and YufR gave a positive result for complementation of the malate transport-minus phenotype of E. coli CBT312 in LT medium containing malate; YufR was further tested, on both solid and liquid media for substrate specificity, and was found not to support growth on citrate, fumarate, or succinate. As assessed qualitatively from the blue color that developed, YufR was slightly more efficacious than YqkIJ in promoting growth on malate, and neither YqkI nor YheL differed from control plasmid. As shown in Table II, although all the transformants grew well on glucose-containing M9 medium, only YqkIJ and YufR supported growth of E. coli CBT312 on malate. Growth was dependent on the presence of Na+in the medium. The results were consistent with YqkI being a malate uptake system that depended on Na+ and probably also on adequate lactate, given the requirement for YqkJ.Table IIGrowth of various transformants of the malate transport mutant, E. coli CBT312, on malate- or glucose-containing M9 medium and its dependence upon Na +TransformantGrowth2-aGrowth on malate-containing M9 medium, containing 44 mm Na+ or K+ as indicated, was assessed via A600 after 72 h of incubation.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 3 A, the Na+ sensitivity of E. coli EP432 in LBK medium was exacerbated by YufR. In this very undefined rich medium there is probably enough contaminating malate for this symporter, which mediates Na+-coupled solute uptake, to take in an inhibitory level of Na+. The transformants containing these genes were further examined versus the control transformant in malate- and glucose-containing media. Although all three transformants were equally sensitive to growth inhibition by Na+ in glucose-containing medium (Fig. 3 C), YqkI and YqkIJ conferred significant resistance to Na+ when E. coli EP432 was grown on malate (Fig. 3 B). The results of the growth studies were thus consistent with YufR being a Na+/solute symporter and YqkI being a transporter that mediates Na+ efflux, which is somehow coupled to a capacity for malate uptake. Transformation of E. coli EP432 with a yheL-containing plasmid did not result in substantial complementation of Na+ sensitivity, as expected for a relatively high affinity system of the NhaC type (13Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3851-3857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake of 22Na+ by everted vesicles made from control, pYheL, and pYqkI transformants of E. coli EP432 was examined as a function of intravesicular malate, extravesicular lactate, and an electron donor. The everted YheL vesicles took up 22Na+ when an electron donor was added, either NADH alone or NADH and lactate, and exhibited no dependence on intravesicular malate or on the specific presence of lactate as long as NADH was added. By contrast, the everted YqkI vesicles exhibited significant 22Na+ uptake, but only in the presence of both extravesicular lactate and intravesicular malate (Fig. 4). Because the apparent necessity of extravesicular lactate for22Na+ uptake by YqkI vesicles made it impossible to evaluate transport in the absence of an energy source, inhibitors were employed to probe the energetics of the exchanges catalyzed by YheL and YqkI. In the experiments shown in Fig.5 A, everted YqkI vesicles of E. coli EP432 were loaded with l-malate and energized with NADH. The uptake of 22Na+ and the effect of inhibitors was assayed upon addition of both the radiolabeled Na+ and extravesicular lactate. The uptake of22Na+ was markedly inhibited by both CCCP and nigericin but not by valinomycin. The effect of nigericin is consistent with an energizing role for the ΔpH component of Δp. The lack of inhibition by valinomycin suggests the absence of such a role for ΔΨ in the YqkI-mediated antiport. That is, the exchange is likely to involve movement of one or more protons with the malate and, overall, to be an electroneutral antiport. In the experiments shown in Fig. 5 B, everted YheL vesicles of E. coli EP432 were assayed for 22Na+ uptake upon being energized by NADH without any intravesicular malate or extravesicular lactate. In contrast to the inhibition pattern observed with the YqkI-mediated exchange, the YheL-mediated Na+/H+ antiport was markedly inhibited by both valinomycin and CCCP; nigericin inhibited YheL-mediated Na+/H+ antiport only modestly. The results are consistent with the YheL-mediated antiport being electrogenic, as anticipated for a Na+/H+antiport that plays a role in alkali resistance (8MacNab R.M. Castle A.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The experiments with the mutant E. coli CBT312 directly supported a role for YqkI in malate transport, and the vesicle experiments above demonstrated YqkI-mediated Na+ flux. Direct evidence for YqkI-mediated transport of the lactate via the putative malate/Na-lactate exchange was then sought by assaying [14C]lactic acid uptake by everted YqkI vesicles of E. coli EP432 as a function of the presence of NADH, intravesicular malate, and extravesicular Na+. In the absence of added Na+ (Fig.6 A), modest stimulation of uptake, over a lactate-only reaction mixture, was caused by the inclusion of NADH and intravesicular malate. By contrast, vesicles assayed in the “complete” reaction mixture, with intravesicular malate, extravesicular NADH, Na+, and [14C]lactate, exhibited impressive uptake of the labeled transport substrate (Fig. 6 B). The rate of antiport was much higher in the complete mixture than in mixtures from which either NADH or intravesicular malate was omitted. The absence of valinomycin inhibition of energized YqkI-mediated uptake of 22Na+ by everted vesicles suggested that the antiport might be electroneutral, e.g.malic−2-2H+/Na+-lactate−1. If so, energized uptake of [14C]lactate by everted YqkI vesicles, in the presence of intravesicular malate and extravesicular Na+, would be inhibited by CCCP and nigericin, which would abolish the ΔpH. Valinomycin, which abolishes ΔΨ, would not inhibit. Stimulation by valinomycin might even be observed with this substrate if its transport was entirely dependent on YqkI, because the ΔpH would be elevated upon abolition of the ΔΨ by valinomycin. As shown in Fig. 7 A, both CCCP and nigericin indeed inhibited lactate uptake by YqkI vesicles in a complete reaction mix and valinomycin caused a reproducible stimulation of lactate uptake. That stimulation supported the conclusion that the antiport is electroneutral and can be energized by ΔpH, but not by ΔΨ. A more direct probe of this conclusion was warranted, because the antiport catalyzed by some other malolactate antiporters has been proposed to involve net inward movement of negative charge,e.g. Hmalate−1 or malic−2-H+/lactic or lactate−1-H+ antiport in L. lactis(24Bandell M. Ansanay V. Rachidi N. Dequin S. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18140-18146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Perhaps the YqkI-mediated antiport is also an electrogenic Hmalate−1 or malic−2-H+/Na+-lactate−1antiport instead of an electroneutral malic−2-2H+/Na+-lactate−1antiport. The stimulatory effect of valinomycin in energized vesicles might only reflect a dominance of the role of the ΔpH under the particular assay conditions. To clarify this, YqkI-mediated uptake of [14C]lactic acid was assayed under de-energized conditions in cyanide-treated everted vesicles in which uptake was driven only by the gradients of the solutes. If the antiport were electrogenic, the ΔΨ developed during antiport should be a major constraint on the rate of lactic acid uptake and valinomycin should stimulate uptake significantly. If the antiport were electroneutral, valinomycin would be anticipated to have no effect. As shown in Fig.7 B, valinomycin had no effect. The YheL vesicles of E. coli EP432 were, finally, assayed for [14C]lactate uptake, energized by NADH, that was dependent on extravesicular Na+ and/or intravesicular malate. No such uptake was observed, indicating that YheL does not have a malolactate mode in addition to its malate- and lactate-independent Na+/H+ antiport activity. Growth studies of the mutant strain with a disrupted yqkI were conducted in comparison to the wild type to test the hypothesis that the pathway might be important for growth on Na-malate, especially when highly aerobic conditions are compromised by high cell densities or when the Δp is directly reduced by inclusion of sublethal protonophore concentrations in the medium. As shown in Fig.8 for growth up to 10 h, B. subtilis wild type and VK3 grew similarly on glucose or malate under aerobic conditions in the absence of protonophore. In general, the growth of the mutant on malate slowed down slightly, relative to the wild type, after the first few hours of growth. In the presence of 1 or 2 μm CCCP, both strains exhibited a growth lag on Na-malate. In several independent experiments, the lag was slightly less pronounced in strain VK3, and the initial rate of growth on malate in the presence of CCCP was slightly faster in the mutant than in the wild type strain. However, once growth on malate in the presence of CCCP commenced in the wild type, it proceeded logarithmically, reaching the A600 values of 1.4–1.5 shown for the wild type in the absence of CCCP by 14–18 h. By contrast, growth of VK3 on malate in the presence of CCCP was arrested when the A600 of the cultures was only 0.15–0.25. At 2 μm CCCP, the growth turbidity declined thereafter for several hours at least, whereas at 1 μm CCCP the turbidity was steady. Although not shown, VK3 did exhibit a very slow renewed growth on malate after hours of growth arrest in the presence of CCCP. This may indicate the presence of another system that is slowly induced and can partially compensate for the role of YqkI. There was no difference in the CCCP effect on growth of the two strains on glucose. The major findings of the current study are that B. subtilis possesses an antiporter, YqkI, that couples a malate-lactate exchange to proton uptake and Na+ efflux and that this transporter plays a role in supporting growth to high density on malate at reduced protonmotive force. We suggest that yqkI be designated mleN to reflect its commonality of function with other malolactate exchangers, and using the “N” to denote Na+. The coupling of Na+efflux to such a precursor-product exchange has not been previously reported. The transport data strongly indicate that the MleN-mediated antiport is electroneutral, which further distinguishes it from the malolactate exchanges reported for both L. lactis (23Poolman B.

Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1274-1282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The simplest MleN-mediated exchange that is consistent with all the data, and the near neutral pH used in the experiments, would be malic−2-2H+/Na+-lactate−1exchange. MLF pathways have been engineered into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, e.g. by introducing malate transport genes from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the malolactate enzyme from L. lactis (36Bony M.

Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), with a view toward improving the organic acid conversion during fermentation of grape juice. Perhaps MleN would be useful for fermentations in preparations with sodium ion concentrations that are above the optimum for the yeast. The yqkJ product that is the only other putative product of an operon, which includes mleN, is strongly predicted to be a malolactate enzyme that converts malate directly to lactate, as opposed to related malic enzymes that convert malate to pyruvate (38Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The efficacy of YqkJ in providing sufficient cytoplasmic lactate to support strong malate uptake in E. coli CBT312 supports this tentative conclusion. Accordingly, we propose the designation mleA for yqkJ. Heretofore, the MLF pathway has been studied in anaerobes (17Llokema J.S. Poolman B.P. Konings W.N. J. Bioenerget. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Olsen E.B. Russell J.B. Henick-Kling T. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6199-6206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Konings W.N.

Similarly, the other precursor-product pathways that can generate a Δp have also been found in fermentative bacteria (39Abe K. Hayashi H. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3079-3084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Molenaar D. Bosscher J.S. TenBrink B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J.

Lonvaud-Funel A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 116: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The finding of an apparent and novel MLF in B. subtilis is thus intriguing. This MLF pathway, encompassing the MleN antiport and MleA activity, would result in net conversion of malate to lactate and CO2, with concomitant extrusion of Na+ and acidification of the cytoplasm (uptake of one net proton inasmuch as two protons enter with malate and one cytoplasmic proton is consumed in the malate-to-lactate conversion). Because the precursor and product gradients could drive the transport reaction even at low Δp, mimicking the protocol with cyanide-treated vesicles (Fig. 7), we anticipated that cells of B. subtilis could use this pathway as a malate uptake and Na+/H+ antiport mode that is relatively resistant to low oxygen or low Δp conditions. Increased use of the MLF pathway might, for example, underlie some of the energetics of malate-supported growth of protonophore-resistant mutants of B. subtilis in the presence of CCCP (43Guffanti A.A. Clejan S. Falk L.H. Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4469-4478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The growth studies on B. subtilis VK3 support this hypothesis and specifically suggest that malate uptake via MleN (YqkI) is important past the initial hours of growth when the Δp has been reduced, e.g.as done here with protonophores. Similar decreases in Δp might occur in various natural environments via suboptimal reductions in oxygenation or encounters with chaotropic agents, bacteriocins, etc. The transport reactions catalyzed by two other cation-coupled transporters have been established in this study. YheL is produced by the yheL gene, which is part of an operon with one other gene, yheK, which is strongly predicted to be a regulatory gene. The experiments in the current study support earlier observations in yheL deletion strains of B. subtilis that suggested that YheL is a secondary, electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporter that makes modest contributions to pH homeostasis in the alkaline range of pH but is not a contributor to Na+ resistance (14Wang W. Guffanti A.A. Wei Y. Ito M. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2088-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). YheL, despite its sequence similarity with MleN, did not exhibit a mode of Na+/H+ antiport that also includes a malolactate exchange. We propose that the yheKL operon be designated as nhaXnhaC. Several other genomes in the data bases, e.g. of Staphylococcus aureus and Borrelia burgdorferi, contain multiple genes with significant sequence similarity to the nhaC genes of Bacillus species. Perhaps in these organisms too, the paralogous transporters have different activities with some commonality. Finally, the current studies support the prediction that the yufR gene product of B. subtilis is a Na+/malate symporter. The apparent specificity for malate as the organic acid substrate is also true for the closely related MaeP transporter of Streptococcus bovis, which is part of a family of transporters that includes citrate transporters CitP and CitS as well as the MleP from L. lactis (24Bandell M.

We propose that yufR be designated maeN to indicate the demonstrated Na+ coupling of this B. subtilismalate symporter. maeN is directly upstream of the mrp operon, which is importantly involved in Na+resistance in B. subtilis (31Ito M. Guffanti A.A. Oudega B. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2394-2402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps yufR and mrp expression are coordinated under some conditions."

Once in a GTP-bound and -activated conformation, each of these GTPases appear to interact with specific downstream effector proteins. More than 20 candidate targets have been identified so far, such as protein kinases PAKs, ACKs, PKN-related kinases (PRKs), and Rho kinases (ROCKs); lipid kinases phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PIP5K, and PLD and non-kinase proteins such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), partner of Rac1 (POR1), plenty of SH35 (POSH) p67PHOX, IQGAPs, Rhotekin, and others (for a review see Aspenstrom (17Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar)). Although the role of Rho GTPases on actin cytoskeleton organization has been extensively studied, little is known on their effects on one of the other major component of the cytoskeleton of eucaryotic cells, the intermediate filaments (IFs). IFs consist of a heterogeneous tissue-specific family of proteins, which are prevalent in the perinuclear region and extend radially through the cytoplasm, eventually forming close associations with the cell surface, concentrated in regions containing desmosomes (cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell junctions), hemidesmosomes (integrin-mediated adhesive junctions), and other types of adhesion sites (18Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar, 19Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 185: 237-302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal IF also interact with other cytoskeletal elements such as microtubules and microfilaments (20Draberova E. Draber P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1263-1273PubMed Google Scholar, 21Prahlad V. Yoon M. Moir R.D. Vale R.D. Goldman R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Gyoeva F.K.

Interaction with plasma membrane and other cytoskeletal elements involve a number of IF-associated proteins that are essential for maintaining the integrity of IF network (24Djabali K. Histol. Histopathol. 1999; 14: 501-509PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that, at least in actively growing cells, IF are dynamic structures. IF phosphorylation appears to be one of the most predominant biochemical events in coordinating intracellular organization of the IF network (25Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic IF disassembled when phosphorylated by protein kinase A, protein kinase C, calcium calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), and Cdc2 kinases. Interestingly, protein kinase N (PKN), a protein kinase activated by Rho, associates and phosphorylates a subunit of neuron-specific intermediate filament, NFL (26Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H.

Chen X.Q. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6325-6339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we analyzed the possible role of two Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42Hs, in regulating the vimentin IF organization. We show that expression of active Rac1 and Cdc42Hs (V12 or L61 mutants) modified vimentin IF distribution: the normally well-spread distribution of IF became dramatically reorganized around the nucleus. Furthermore, Cdc42Hs and Rac1-dependent vimentin collapse was both different and more pronounced than RhoA-dependent vimentin reorganization. This vimentin collapse was observed following activation of endogenous Cdc42Hs by bradykinin and Rac1 by PDGF/EGF or after active RhoG expression. Because the IF network was closely associated with the actin microfilaments, the dynamics of which was highly regulated by Rho GTPases, we expressed two effector loop mutants of Rac1 and Cdc42Hs that had a differential effect on F-actin organization. Interestingly, the Y40C mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1, which still induced F-actin rearrangements, promoted the collapse of IF as efficiently as did the V12 or L61 mutants. The F37A mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1, which had lost their ability to induce filopodia and membrane ruffling, respectively, no longer induced the collapse of IF. In addition, by using various drugs known to have kinase inhibitory activity, we show that vimentin IF reorganization involved tyrosine phosphorylation events. Rat embryo (REF-52) or human (Hs-68) fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were plated on 18-mm diameter glass coverslips 16–24 h before transfection. Cells were treated with 100 nm cytochalasin D (Sigma, France) for 5–60 min. PDGF/EGF (5 ng ml−1; Sigma, France) and bradykinin (100 ng ml−1; Sigma) were added for 15–60 min.R p-cAMP (Sigma) was used at 3 mm, staurosporin (Sigma) at 50 nm, genistein (Sigma) at 100 μm, LY-294002 (Sigma) at 10 μm, and wortmannin (Sigma) at 100 nm. These drugs were added for 15–120 min. The regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, RII (40 units/μl in the needle; Promega), was microinjected in GFP-expressing cells.

Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)). As a control, cells were transfected with empty vector (pEGFPC1). 4 h after transfection, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum was added and cells were fixed at different times thereafter. 18 h after transfection, cells were fixed for 5 min in 3.7% formalin (in PBS) followed by a 2-min permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) and incubation in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Expression of GFP-tagged proteins was visualized directly. Cells were stained for vimentin distribution using a mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (Sigma, France) (1:200 dilution), followed by incubation with affinity-purified tetramethyl-rhodamin-5 (and 6) isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel-ICN) (1:40 dilution). Cells were stained for F-actin using coumarin phenyl isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma, France) and for phosphotyrosine epitopes using the 4G10 monoclonal antibody. Expression of Myc epitope-tagged proteins was visualized after a 60-min incubation with 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (gift from D. Mathieu, Montpellier, France) (one-half dilution in PBS/bovine serum albumin), followed by incubation with affinity-purified fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Cappel, ICN). Cells were washed in PBS, mounted in Mowviol (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI), and observed using a DMR B Leica microscope using a 40× (NA 1.00) or 63× (NA 1.32) planapochromatic lens. Images obtained were captured with a MicroMax 1300 Y/HS (B/W) cooled (−10 °C) charge-coupled device camera as 16-bit images, and using a MetaMorph (v.4.11) control program (RS-Princeton Instruments) run by a PC-compatible microcomputer. Images were saved in TIFF format (16 bit) and subsequently adapted as TIFF 8-bit format after they were opened with Adobe Photoshop for processing and mounting with Adobe Illustrator. Two distinct methods were used to evaluate the amount of soluble vimentin in cell extracts from control REF-52 cells or REF-52 cells transfected with GFP-Cdc42HsV12 or GFP-Rac1V12. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped, collected, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. Pellets were resuspended in either a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 100 μmNa3VO4 as described previously by Valgeirsdottir et al. (29Valgeirsdottir S. Claesson W.L. Bongcam R.E. Hellman U. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1973-1980PubMed Google Scholar), or 1% Triton, 50 mmMES, 600 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. For the second method, the first soluble pool obtained underwent three successive extractions of 10 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (30Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Feramisco J.R. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2409-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The soluble and insoluble fractions obtained with both methods were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose. Initial lysates were normalized for protein content (BCA, Sigma). Membranes were saturated in 8% milk in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1% Tween and subsequently incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against vimentin (clone V9, Sigma) (1/1000 dilution) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (1/2000 dilution). After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Total cell lysates from untransfected or cells transfected with either empty pEGFPN1 vector (MOCK), Cdc42HsV12, or Rac1V12 were obtained by the addition of 1% boiling SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After scraping, samples (30 μg of protein) were loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were treated as described above and incubated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, 1/200 dilution) followed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (dilution 1/2000). After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Untransfected cells or cells transfected with either empty pEGFPN1 vector (MOCK), Cdc42HsV12, or Rac1V12 were lysed for 20 min in ice-cold modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA) supplemented with 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4. Extracts were immunoprecipitated using a mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin antibody (V9, 1/100 dilution), separated by a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and then transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. To examine the overall effect of two Rho GTPases of the Rac/Cdc subgroup on vimentin IF distribution, mammalian expression plasmids encoding GFP-tagged constitutively active (G12V or Q61L) (for review see Ref. 31Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar), Cdc42Hs, or Rac1 were transfected into growing REF-52 cells. In addition, the activated RhoA mutant, RhoAV14, was also expressed. 18 h later, cells were fixed and immunostained with antibodies directed against vimentin and for filamentous actin (F-actin) using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Fig.1 A). Expression of each of these GTPases induced the formation of specific actin-driven structures. Cdc42Hs (Fig. 1 A, panel a) induced filopodia (panel b), Rac1 (panel e) induced lamellipodia/ruffles (panel f), and RhoA (panel i) induced stress fibers (panel j) as previously reported (4Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 12Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of these GTPases also led to a marked change in the organization of the vimentin network (panels c and g). Indeed, although in control nontransfected cells vimentin showed a well-spread distribution from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery (see control nontransfected cells in panels c, g, andk), in Cdc42Hs- or Rac1-expressing cells, vimentin accumulated at the perinuclear area. Vimentin IF organization was also extensively modified after active RhoA expression (panel k), which is in total agreement with a previous report (32Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Corresponding Normarski images were shown to precisely localize cell margins (panels d, h, and l). Similar effects of Cdc42Hs, Rac1, and RhoA on vimentin distribution were also observed in Hs-68 human fibroblasts (Fig. 1 B). More than 90% of Cdc42Hs-expressing cells and around 75% of Rac1-expressing cells showed extensive IF reorganization, with the same efficiency in REF-52 and Hs-68 cells. In contrast, less than 50% of RhoA-expressing cells presented a modified vimentin IF network. For both cell types, no significant modification in vimentin IF distribution (less than 5%) was detected upon transfection with pEGFPC1. Bradykinin (Bdk) has been shown to activate Cdc42Hs and induce filopodia formation, whereas platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are two mitogens that activate Rac1 and produce lamellipodia (4Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3714) Google Scholar, 10Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3066) Google Scholar, 12Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). To activate endogenous Rac1 and Cdc42Hs proteins, we thus stimulated REF-52 cells with Bdk or PDGF/EGF for different periods of time. Cells were then fixed and immunostained for F-actin to control endogenous Cdc42Hs and Rac1 activation and for vimentin IF distribution (Fig.2). In control unstimulated cells, both actin microfilaments and vimentin IF formed a well-spread network from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery (panels a andb). 15 min after Bdk addition, thin F-actin-rich filopodial extensions were detected at the edges of the cells (panel c). Concomitantly, extensive vimentin IF reorganization into perinuclear caps was observed (panel d), similar to the IF redistribution observed in Cdc42HsV12-expressing cells (Fig.1 A, panel g). 15 min after stimulation with PDGF/EGF, F-actin-containing lamellipodia were observed at the cell periphery (panel e) as well as a vimentin IF perinuclear distribution (panel f) comparable to that observed in Rac1V12-expressing cells (panel k). Activation of endogenous Cdc42Hs and Rac1 was also achieved by expressing active RhoG (13Gauthier R.C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Roux P. Gauthier R.C. Doucet B.S. Fort P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 629-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In REF-52 cells transfected with GFP-tagged RhoGV12 (panel g), local actin polymerization led to the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia (panel h) as well as vimentin IF perinuclear redistribution (panel i). Because previous work reported that IF reorganization could be associated with changes in vimentin solubility (34Soellner P. Quinlan R.A. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7929-7933Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we analyzed the amount of vimentin extractable using either a mild Nonidet P-40-containing lysis buffer (29Valgeirsdottir S. Claesson W.L. Bongcam R.E. Hellman U. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1973-1980PubMed Google Scholar) or high salt and Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (30Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Feramisco J.R. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2409-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) after expression of active Cdc42Hs and Rac1 GTPases. The amount of vimentin present in a soluble form extractable with a mild Nonidet P-40-containing buffer was not modified after expression of these GTPases (Fig. 2 B) as was the case when using the high salt and Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that expression of active Cdc42Hs and Rac1 or activation of endogenous Cdc42Hs and Rac1 all led to vimentin IF perinuclear reorganization without modification of the solubility of vimentin. We next investigated the pathways controlled by Rac1 and Cdc42Hs responsible for vimentin IF collapse. We used effector loop mutants of GTPases previously shown to differentially bind and activate downstream effectors (35Joneson T. McDonough M. Bar-Sagi D. Van Aelst L. Science. 1996; 274: 1374-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 36Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The Y40C mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 had lost their ability to interact with CRIB (Cdc42Hs or Rac-interacting binding) motif-containing proteins and did not activate PAK-1 and JNK activity, but they still induced cortical F-actin polymerization, filopodia, and membrane ruffling, respectively. Conversely, the F37A mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 still bound the CRIB motif-containing proteins, activating PAK and JNK, but were less efficient for inducing filopodia or membrane ruffling. Cells expressing the Y40C mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 showed vimentin IF reorganization comparable to the one observed in active Rho GTPases-expressing cells (V12 or L61 mutants) (compare Fig.1 B with Fig. 3). Under the same conditions, expression of F37A mutants of Cdc42Hs and Rac1 did not significantly affect vimentin IF distribution, because only 10–20% of expressing cells showed weak vimentin reorganization. Interaction of IF with microfilaments is thought to regulate IF organization in vivo (23Chou Y.H. Skalli O. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Rho GTPases of the Rac/Cdc subgroup are well-known key regulators of actin microfilaments (1Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), suggesting that the vimentin IF collapse we observed might result from Rac1- or Cdc42-dependent F-actin reorganization. Two subpopulations of actin structures were affected by Rac1 and Cdc42Hs expression: submembranous cortical actin, which was extensively modified to produce ruffles/lamellipodia and microvilli/filopodia, and stress fibers, which were mostly depolymerized. To test the existence of a relationship between stress fibers, depolymerization, and vimentin reorganization, REF-52 cells were treated with cytochalasin D, an F-actin-depolymerizing drug, fixed, and stained for F-actin and vimentin IF distribution (Fig.4 A). 30 min after cytochalasin D addition, the level of F-actin staining became barely detectable (panel b), whereas the vimentin IF network remained unaffected (panel c). We next transfected REF-52 cells with Scar-WA, a mutant form of the Arp2/3-interacting protein Scar, which prevents assembly of F-actin structures (38Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). As for cytochalasin-treated cells, expression of Myc-tagged Scar-WA (panel d) led to a decrease of F-actin polymerization (panel e) without any significant vimentin IF modifications (panel e). At variance, as shown in Fig. 4 B, coexpression of Scar-WA (panels b ande) with active Cdc42Hs (panel a) or Rac1 (panel d) as well as cytochalasin D treatment of Cdc42 and Rac1-expressing cells (data not shown) led to inhibition of Cdc42 or Rac1-dependent vimentin reorganization (panels c and f). As shown by the arrow in Fig. 4B (panel d) is a cell expressing only GFP_Rac1V12 showing a collapsed vimentin. These data show that, although an overall F-actin depolymerization did not affect vimentin organization, inhibition of Cdc42Hs- and Rac1-dependent F-actin modification impaired Cdc42Hs and Rac1-induced vimentin redistribution. Phosphorylation has been shown to be a major regulatory pathway coordinating intracellular organization of the IF network, so we used various drugs having known kinase inhibitory activity to address the involvement of phosphorylation events in vimentin IF collapse in Cdc42Hs- or Rac1-expressing cells (TableI). First, we analyzed the effects of inhibiting protein kinase A activity, a protein that induced both the collapse of vimentin IF and F-actin reorganization (30Lamb N.J. Fernandez A. Feramisco J.R. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2409-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) by two ways: microinjection of the RII regulatory subunit of protein kinase A in GFP-Cdc42HsV12- or GFP-Rac1V12-expressing cells or addition of a cAMP antagonist R p-cAMP to GFP-Cdc42HsV12- or GFP-Rac1V12-expressing cells. Second, we treated GFP-Cdc42HsV12- and GFP-Rac1V12-expressing cells with the PI3Kinhibitors LY-294002 and wortmannin (39Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, we used staurosporin, an inhibitor of various serine/threonine kinases. In all cases, no modification of the vimentin IF reorganization induced by Cdc42Hs and Rac1 was observed. Finally, we treated GFP-Cdc42HsV12- and GFP-Rac1V12-expressing cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein for 15 to 120 min (40Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, cells treated with this compound displayed a less pronounced reorganization of the vimentin IF network upon Cdc42Hs and Rac1 expression (panels a/b and c/e) as compared with Fig. 1. This inhibitory effect on vimentin IF reorganization was not correlated with F-actin modific"
https://openalex.org/W2109240986,"Abstract G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels are a family of K+-selective ion channels that slow the firing rate of neurons and cardiac myocytes. GIRK channels are directly bound and activated by the G protein Gβγ subunit. As heterotetramers, they comprise the GIRK1 and the GIRK2, -3, or -4 subunits. Here we show that GIRK1 but not the GIRK4 subunit is phosphorylated when heterologously expressed. We found also that phosphatase PP2A dephosphorylation of a protein in the excised patch abrogates channel activation by Gβγ. Experiments with the truncated molecule demonstrated that the GIRK1 C-terminal is critical for both channel phosphorylation and channel regulation by protein phosphorylation, but the critical phosphorylation sites were not located on the C terminus. These data provide evidence for a novel switch mechanism in which protein phosphorylation enables Gβγ gating of the channel complex."
https://openalex.org/W2115274741,Magnetic neutron scattering provides evidence for nucleation of antiferromagnetic droplets around impurities in a doped nickel oxide–based quantum magnet. The undoped parent compound contains a spin liquid with a cooperative singlet ground state and a gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum. Calcium doping creates excitations below the gap with an incommensurate structure factor. We show that weakly interacting antiferromagnetic droplets with a central phase shift of π and a size controlled by the correlation length of the quantum liquid can account for the data. The experiment provides a quantitative impression of the magnetic polarization cloud associated with holes in a doped transition metal oxide.

Adherens junction formation is accompanied by the tyrosine dephosphorylation of adherens junctions proteins, which has been correlated with the strength and stability of adherens junctions. Here we show that cholesterol is a critical determinant of plasma membrane remodeling in cultures of growing cow pulmonary aortic endothelial cells. Membrane cholesterol increased dramatically at an early stage in the formation of confluent cow pulmonary aortic endothelial cell monolayers, prior to formation of intercellular junctions. This increase was accompanied by the redistribution of caveolin from a high density to a low density membrane compartment, previously shown to require cholesterol, and increased binding of the annexin II-p11 complex to membranes, consistent with other studies indicating cholesterol-dependent binding of annexin II to membranes. Furthermore, partial depletion of cholesterol from confluent cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin both induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple membrane proteins, including adherens junctions proteins, and disrupted adherens junctions. Both effects were dramatically reduced by prior complexing of methyl-β-cyclodextrin with cholesterol.

Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments in our laboratory, we noted a dramatic increase in membrane-bound annexin II (Ax II)1 as cultures of cow pulmonary aortic endothelial (CPAE) cells reached confluence. In view of recent studies (29Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) implicating cholesterol in the mechanism of the binding of Ax II to membranes, we reasoned that cholesterol might also increase with endothelial cell confluence. In fact, membrane cholesterol has been reported to increase 4-fold in EA926 endothelial cells upon reaching confluence (30Cansell M. Gouygou J.-P. Jozefonvicz J. Letourneur D. Lipids. 1997; 32: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cholesterol has been implicated both in the mechanisms of multiple signaling pathways (31Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F.

Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 35Danielson E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us that cholesterol might act in pathways that establish cell junctions and other properties of confluent endothelial monolayers. Here, we identify several cholesterol-dependent events that remodel the plasma membrane as endothelial cells reach confluence, most importantly the formation of adherens junctions and the dephosphorylation of adherens junctions proteins. These results reveal a novel physiological role for cholesterol in the regulation of endothelial barrier function. CPAE cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and cultured in minimal essential medium (ATCC number 30-2003) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 mg/ml). Monoclonal antibodies to Ax II, p11, clathrin heavy chain, pp120, and γ-catenin and a polyclonal antiserum to caveolin 1 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). A monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10), either in solution or conjugated to protein A-agarose, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody was purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Digitonin was purchased from Calbiochem. TMA-DPH was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical. Except as noted, CPAE cells were grown for 2 days to low densities (10–30% confluent), trypsinized, and replated at either high (1.5–2.0 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) or low (1.0–1.4 × 105 cells/150-mm dish) density, grown for 2 days to obtain confluent or subconfluent cultures, respectively, and harvested. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by first rinsing the cells twice and swelling them for 10 minutes in a 10-fold dilution of cytosol buffer (cytosol buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 125 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2m sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 0.01 mg/ml tosylargininemethylester, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm 1, 10 phenanthrine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) in water. The cells were then rinsed twice in cytosol buffer, harvested by scraping into a minimal amount of cytosol buffer (∼0.5 ml), and homogenized by passing them through a 27-gauge, 1.25-inch needle 15 times. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × gfor 10 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells, yielding postnuclear supernatants. To prepare membrane fractions by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the postnuclear supernatants were first centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 15 min in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. The cytosolic fractions were removed, and the membrane pellets were resuspended in 0.25 ml of cytosol buffer and recentrifuged. The washed membranes were resuspended in 0.25 ml of cytosol buffer and brought to equal protein concentrations, and equal volumes of membranes were layered onto sucrose step gradients containing 0.61 ml each of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55% sucrose in cytosol buffer. The gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. Either 11 or 12 fractions of equal volume were collected manually from the top of the gradient and mixed with 0.35 volumes of a 5× stock of SDS sample buffer. To compare cytosolic and membrane fractions, the postnuclear supernatants were made equal in protein concentration, and equal volumes were centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 15 min. The cytosolic fractions were removed, and the membranes were brought to their initial volume with cytosol buffer. A 50% volume of SDS gel sample buffer (5× stock) was added to each sample, which was then boiled and analyzed by electrophoresis. No particulates were detected in samples prepared from membranes in this way, and insoluble proteins were virtually recovered in full (e.g. cf. Fig.1). Silver-stained polypeptides were excised from a polyacrylamide gel, destained, and tryptically digested in-gel (38Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The digest products were eluted with acetonitrile and further concentrated and desalted with ZipTip 18 microtips (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Peptide masses were determined using a Kratos (Manchester, United Kingdom) Analytical Kompact SEQ Reflector matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with a curved field reflectron. Peptide masses were searched against a nonredundant protein data base using MS-Fit of Protein Prospector, a program available from the World Wide Web site of the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of California at San Francisco. Fragmentation data from individual peptides obtained by postsource decay using the Kratos instrument were searched against nonredundant protein data bases using MS-Tag of Protein Prospector. Homogenates from either untreated cells or cells treated with cyclodextrin (6%) or cyclodextrin (6%)-cholesterol (0.24%) complexes were prepared as described above, except that the cytosol buffer contained 1 mmNa3VO4. The homogenates were normalized for total protein, and equal volumes were mixed with 0.11 volumes of a 10× detergent stock (10% Triton X-100, 1.0% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1.0 m NaCl) in cytosol buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants, containing 60 μg of protein, were incubated with 5 μg of monoclonal antibody (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY)) conjugated to protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed seven times with a solution of 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.01% SDS, and 0.1 m NaCl in cytosol buffer. Bound proteins were solubilized in SDS gel sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Cells were scraped into a minimal volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and homogenized by passage through a 27-gauge, 1.25-inch needle 15 times. For each sample, a sufficient amount of cytosol buffer was added to bring the homogenate to 5.5 ml, the protein concentration was measured, and 5.25 ml was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm. Lipids were then extracted according to the following modification of Bligh and Dyer (36Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). The pellets were resuspended in 0.4 ml of TBS, and 1.5 ml of a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol and chloroform was added. The samples were vortexed, 0.5 ml of chloroform was added, the samples were vortexed again, 0.5 ml of water was added, and the samples were vortexed again. The samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 2 min, the chloroform (bottom) layer was removed, and 1.0 ml of chloroform was added to the aqueous phase to extract residual lipid. The samples were again vortexed and centrifuged as before, and the second chloroform layer was removed. The two chloroform extracts were pooled, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 0.1 ml of isopropyl alcohol, and assayed for cholesterol using a kit (catalog no. 139 050) purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. When samples of cholesterol standard solutions in TBS were extracted using this method, they were quantitatively (>95%) recovered. Complexes of cholesterol and methyl-β−cyclodextrin were either purchased directly from Sigma or prepared by a modification of the procedure of Klein et al. (31Klein U. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13784-13793Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 ml of a 6% solution of methyl-β−cyclodextrin was brought to 80 °C. 120 μl of a 6% solution of cholesterol in isopropyl alcohol was then added dropwise with stirring, resulting in a cholesterol/cyclodextrin ratio (w/w) of 0.03. After dispersal of the cholesterol, the solution was allowed to cool to 37 °C with stirring and either used immediately or lyophilized and reconstituted in cell culture medium. Cells were cultured overnight in medium supplemented with [3H]cholesterol (NEN Life Science Products) at 12.5 μCi/ml. The cells were then rinsed three times with unlabeled medium, returned to the incubator for 1 h more, either treated or not with cyclodextrin (6%) for the indicated time, and harvested as described above. Radiolabel content was quantitated by scintillation counting of postnuclear supernatants, prepared as described above, and normalized for protein. Relative cell surface area was measured by binding of the membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye TMA-DPH (37Lange Y. Swaisgood M.H. Ramos B.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3786-3793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPAE cells were cultured to subconfluent or confluent densities, treated with trypsin (0.13% in PBS) for 10 min at 37 °C, centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in PBS, centrifuged again, and resuspended in PBS. Cell suspensions were made equal in cell density, and 0.02 volumes of a stock solution of TMA-DPH (0.25 mm in Me2SO) was added. The cells were mixed gently, incubated on ice for 1 min, centrifuged as above to remove unbound reagent, and resuspended to their initial volume in PBS. Fluorescence intensity of the bound reagent was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 375 and 432 nm, respectively, subtracting the fluorescence of cells suspended at the same density without reagent. The fluorescence intensity of the bound reagent increased linearly with cell density up to 2 × 105 cells/ml. Cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min in paraformaldehyde (4%) in 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (TBS), permeabilized for 5 min in Triton X-100 (0.5% in TBS), incubated in blocking solution (fetal bovine serum (1.0%) plus Triton X-100 (0.5%) in TBS) for 15 min, and incubated with a monoclonal antibody to pp120 (2.5 μg/ml in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C. Coverslips were washed three times for 5 min each in blocking buffer, incubated for 1 h in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories) diluted 1:250 in blocking buffer, washed as before, and mounted using Anti-Fade Mounting Medium (Molecular Probes). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were silver-stained using a kit (Bio-Rad catalog no. 161-0449). The antibodies to clathrin, Ax II, and caveolin were diluted 1:5000 for immunoblotting; the antibodies to pp120 and p11 were diluted 1:2000. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were detected on immunoblots using a chemiluminescence reagent from NEN Life Science Products. Immunoreactive bands were digitized using an Agfa (Mortsel, Belgium) Arcus II scanner, and band intensities were measured using Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA). Relative amounts of protein were determined by fitting the band intensities to a standard curve. All polyacrylamide gels and immunoblots are representative of at least three separate experiments. Protein concentrations were determined using a Coomassie Blue-based reagent (Bio-Rad catalog no. 500-0006). In preliminary studies in our laboratory, we found that membranes prepared from confluent CPAE cells contained dramatically higher levels of Ax II than did membranes from subconfluent cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, cytosolic fractions from subconfluent and confluent cells contained approximately equal amounts of Ax II, while postnuclear supernatants from confluent cells contained more Ax II than did those prepared from subconfluent cells. Thus, we observed higher levels of Ax II in confluent versus subconfluent cells, and the additional Ax II in confluent cells appeared to be specifically recruited to the membrane, and not the cytosolic, fraction. Fractionation of membranes from subconfluent and confluent CPAE cells indicated that Ax II was entirely recruited to low density membranes (Fig. 1 B), consistent with other studies localizing Ax II to low density endosomal and plasma membrane fractions (29Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In CPAE cells, Ax II exists, in part, in a heterotetrameric complex with p11 (39Kassam G. Le B.-H. Choi K.-S. Kang H.-M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a member of the S100 family of calcium-binding proteins (40Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). Like Ax II, p11 was dramatically enriched in membranes prepared from confluent, rather than subconfluent, CPAE cells (Fig.1 A). However, virtually no p11 was detected in cytosolic fractions from either subconfluent or confluent cells, and postnuclear supernatants prepared from confluent cells contained much higher levels of p11, indicating its increased level of expression. Recently, Harder et al. (29Harder T. Kellner R. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 533-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) identified Ax II as one of a small group of proteins extracted from bovine hamster kidney membranes by 0.01% digitonin, which selectively binds to membrane cholesterol but not other membrane components (41Elias P.M. Goerke J. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We found that all of the membrane-bound Ax II and p11 in CPAE cells was also solubilized after extraction with 0.01% digitonin (Fig. 1 C), as well as with Triton X-100 (1%). Silver-stained gels of the detergent extracts (Fig.1 D) indicated that a polypeptide migrating at the position of Ax II (∼35 kDa) was by far the most prominent species extracted with 0.01% digitonin, and mass spectrometry of the products of an in-gel tryptic digest of this polypeptide confirmed it to be Ax II. In addition, numerous polypeptides were extracted by Triton X-100, but not digitonin (Fig. 1 D), indicating that digitonin at 0.01% did not solubilize a broad range of membrane components, as expected. Neither digitonin nor Triton X-100 extracted clathrin, consistent with several studies reporting membrane-bound clathrin to be detergent-insoluble (42Pearse B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 43Widenmann B. Lawley K. Grund C. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 44Passanti A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). EGTA (1 mm) also solubilized most of the membrane-bound Ax II, consistent with the calcium-dependent binding exhibited by Ax II to both liposomes (46Powell M.A. Glenney J.R. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 47Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and organelles (48Drust D.S. Creutz C.E. Nature. 1988; 331: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). The observation that membrane binding of the Ax II-p11 complex could be disrupted by digitonin indicated that this binding depended on cholesterol. Since we had also observed that binding of the Ax II-p11 complex to membranes increased with cell confluence, these observations suggested to us that membrane cholesterol might also increase with confluence in CPAE cell cultures. In fact, membrane cholesterol has been reported to increase 3–4-fold in EA926 endothelial cells upon reaching confluence (30Cansell M. Gouygou J.-P. Jozefonvicz J. Letourneur D. Lipids. 1997; 32: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and we found that CPAE cells exhibited a 3.6-fold increase in membrane cholesterol upon reaching confluence (32 ± 4 versus 9 ± 1 μg of cholesterol/mg of protein, n = 3; confluentversus subconfluent, respectively). In contrast, the surface area per μg of protein of confluent CPAE cells, measured by binding of TMA-DPH, was only 0.96 ± 0.05-fold (n = 2) that of subconfluent cells, indicating that other plasma membrane lipids did not increase proportionately with cholesterol. To begin to evaluate the functional significance of this increase, we compared the subcellular distributions of caveolin-1, a cholesterol-associated protein, in subconfluent and confluent CPAE cells. Partial depletion of cholesterol with methyl-β-cyclodextrin has been found to relocalize caveolin-1 and -2 from low density to high density plasma membrane vesicles (33Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This redistribution was found to correlate with an inhibition of epidermal growth factor- and bradykinin-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (33Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Since membrane cholesterol increased as CPAE cells reached confluence, we reasoned that caveolin-1 might translocate from membrane fractions of high density to low density with increasing confluence. Membranes prepared from subconfluent or confluent CPAE cells were fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the distribution of caveolin-1 was examined by immunoblotting (Fig.2, A and B). Membranes from subconfluent cells contained a single population of caveolin-1-rich vesicles, migrating at a peak density of 44% sucrose. In contrast, membranes from confluent cells contained an additional caveolin-1 peak, migrating at 31% sucrose, containing slightly less than half of the total caveolin-1, which may represent caveolin-rich membranes containing increased levels of cholesterol (Ref. 33Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22298-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar; see above). Thus, the increased cholesterol in confluent CPAE cells did, in fact, correlate with the redistribution of a protein in the manner predicted on the basis of its association with cholesterol. In contrast with caveolin-1, immunoblots indicated that neither the distribution nor the amount of clathrin, which was primarily present in high density membrane fractions, changed with cell confluence (Fig. 2 A), and silver-stained gels indicated that the overall polypeptide composition of membrane fractions appeared to be largely independent of cell confluence (Fig. 2 A). The effects of confluence on the subcellular distributions of caveolin-1 and Ax II indicated that the increased cho"

Recent studies identified several apoE mutations in patients with LPG, including apoE2(R145P) Sendai (apoE-Sendai). Virus-mediated transduction of apoE-Sendai in apoE-deficient hypercholesterolemic mice resulted in insufficient correction of hypercholesterolemia and a marked and temporal induction of plasma triglyceride levels. In vitro binding studies showed that apoE-Sendai has a reduced affinity for the low density lipoprotein receptor, suggesting that dysbetalipoproteinemia in LPG is caused by the apoE mutation. Furthermore, histological examination revealed marked intraglomerular depositions of apoE-containing lipoproteins in mice injected with apoE-Sendai virus. These LPG-like depositions were detected 6 days after virus injection and were sustained for at least 60 days. Our results demonstrated that apoE-Sendai is an etiological cause of LPG.

Our results demonstrated that apoE-Sendai is an etiological cause of LPG. lipoprotein glomerulopathy very low density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein high performance liquid chromatography dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine Genetic abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism are associated with various disorders ranging from classical familial hypercholesterolemia to renal diseases including lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG).1 LPG is a recently identified renal disease originally described in 1989 by Saito et al. (1Saito T. Sato H. Kudo K. Oikawa S. Shibata T. Hara Y. Yoshinaga K. Sakaguchi H. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1989; 13: 148-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is characterized by intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombi associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and proteinuria and is frequently manifested in nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Histological characteristics of this disease are deposition of thrombus-like substances in the markedly dilated glomerular capillaries, capillary lumina filled with dense granules, and vacuoles of lipid with lamella- and cobblestone-like formations (2Saito T. Oikawa S. Sasaki J. Nephron. 1999; 83: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Patients with LPG have elevated concentrations of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein, and plasma apoE to levels similar to those seen in dysbetalipoproteinemia (3Oikawa S. Suzuki N. Sakuma E. Saito T. Namai K. Kotake H. Fujii Y. Toyota T. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 18: 553-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The frequency of the apoE2 phenotype in LPG patients is extremely high, and this led to the identification of a missense mutation of apoE, designated apoE2(R145P) Sendai (apoE-Sendai), in patients with LPG (4Oikawa S. Matsunaga A. Saito T. Sato H. Seki T. Hoshi K. Hayasaka K. Kotake H. Midorikawa H. Sekikawa A. Hara S. Abe K. Toyota T. Jingami H. Nakamura H. Sasaki J. J. Am. Soc.

Since the discovery of apoE-Sendai, various apoE mutations have been identified in LPG, including a missense mutation, apoE2(R25C) Kyoto (designated apoE-Kyoto) (5Matsunaga A. Sasaki J. Komatsu T.

Excluding apoE-Kyoto, all these mutations occurred within exon 4 of the human apoE gene, which contains a cluster of basic amino acids constituting a site responsible for binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (9Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Although these amino acid mutations may account for dysbetalipoproteinemia in patients with LPG, whether they are related to abnormal lipoprotein deposition in LPG remained unclarified.To demonstrate that apoE-Sendai is directly related to lipoprotein deposition in LPG, we have introduced apoE-Sendai into apoE-deficient hypercholesterolemic mice using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Here we provide the first evidence that apoE-Sendai is an etiological cause of LPG.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have provided direct evidence that apoE-Sendai as an etiological cause of LPG using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoE-deficient mice. The data presented in this study strongly suggest that dysbetalipoproteinemia manifested by severe hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with LPG is caused by the apoE-Sendai mutation. As with mice expressing apoE2, a major genetic prerequisite for dysbetalipoproteinemia (20Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Rall S.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1991; 265: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), expression of apoE-Sendai resulted in the insufficient normalization of hypercholesterolemia in apoE-deficient mice and induced high plasma levels of triglyceride. Although the mechanism of plasma triglyceride induction is currently unknown, it may be related to the hepatic uptake of plasma cholesterol by the LDL receptor. Like apoE2, apoE-Sendai exhibits a reduced binding activity for the LDL receptor, and this may lower the hepatic cholesterol pool, thereby increasing lipogenesis mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (21Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

These LPG-like depositions were detected 6 days after virus injection and were sustained for at least 60 days. In contrast, such abnormalities were undetectable in mice injected with apoE2 virus, suggesting that dysbetalipoproteinemia itself does not account for the glomerular deposition of lipoproteins. Then the question raised is as to why certain forms of apoE cause glomerular deposition of lipoproteins. In apoE-Sendai, a single nucleotide change substitutes arginine 145, located in the middle of the α-helix of apoE, with proline, which is known as a helix breaker in globular proteins (3Oikawa S. Suzuki N. Sakuma E. Saito T. Namai K. Kotake H. Fujii Y. Toyota T. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 18: 553-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This amino acid substitution may transform the physicochemical properties of apoE in a way that tends to form aggregated deposits in the glomerulus, where plasma macromolecules are highly concentrated by glomerular filtration. Other apoE mutations associated with LPG may have similar physicochemical properties.Another explanation for glomerular lipoprotein deposition is a prolonged retention of apoE-Sendai protein in the glomerulus in a way similar to that postulated for apoB100 in the development of atherosclerosis (22Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB100 can bind to proteoglycans in addition to the LDL receptor, and this interaction is believed to slow the clearance of LDL from the arterial wall and to facilitate the development of atherosclerosis (23Boren J. Olin K. Lee I. Chait A. Wight T.N. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2658-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Like apoB100, apoE-Sendai may have some affinity for matrix proteins or cell-surface proteins in the glomerulus, leading to the retention and accumulation of lipoproteins containing apoE-Sendai. Although the exact mechanism causing the lipoprotein deposition in the glomerulus remains unclarified, the data presented here demonstrate that certain forms of apoE are an etiological cause of LPG and provide a base for the effective prevention and treatment of LPG. Genetic abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism are associated with various disorders ranging from classical familial hypercholesterolemia to renal diseases including lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG).1 LPG is a recently identified renal disease originally described in 1989 by Saito et al. (1Saito T. Sato H. Kudo K. Oikawa S. Shibata T. Hara Y. Yoshinaga K. Sakaguchi H. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1989; 13: 148-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is characterized by intraglomerular lipoprotein thrombi associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and proteinuria and is frequently manifested in nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Histological characteristics of this disease are deposition of thrombus-like substances in the markedly dilated glomerular capillaries, capillary lumina filled with dense granules, and vacuoles of lipid with lamella- and cobblestone-like formations (2Saito T. Oikawa S. Sasaki J. Nephron. 1999; 83: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Patients with LPG have elevated concentrations of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein, and plasma apoE to levels similar to those seen in dysbetalipoproteinemia (3Oikawa S. Suzuki N. Sakuma E. Saito T. Namai K. Kotake H. Fujii Y. Toyota T. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1991; 18: 553-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The frequency of the apoE2 phenotype in LPG patients is extremely high, and this led to the identification of a missense mutation of apoE, designated apoE2(R145P) Sendai (apoE-Sendai), in patients with LPG (4Oikawa S. Matsunaga A. Saito T. Sato H. Seki T. Hoshi K. Hayasaka K. Kotake H. Midorikawa H. Sekikawa A. Hara S. Abe K. Toyota T. Jingami H. Nakamura H. Sasaki J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 820-823PubMed Google Scholar). Since the discovery of apoE-Sendai, various apoE mutations have been identified in LPG, including a missense mutation, apoE2(R25C) Kyoto (designated apoE-Kyoto) (5Matsunaga A. Sasaki J. Komatsu T.

Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1317-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), apoE1(His141–Leu144 → 0 or Arg142–Arg146 → 0) Tokyo (apoE-Tokyo) (7Konishi K. Saruta T. Kuramochi S. Oikawa S. Saito T. Han H. Matsunaga A. Sasaki J. Nephron. 1999; 83: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and apoE(His141–Lys146 → 0) Maebashi (apoE-Maebashi) (8Ogawa T.

Excluding apoE-Kyoto, all these mutations occurred within exon 4 of the human apoE gene, which contains a cluster of basic amino acids constituting a site responsible for binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (9Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). Although these amino acid mutations may account for dysbetalipoproteinemia in patients with LPG, whether they are related to abnormal lipoprotein deposition in LPG remained unclarified. To demonstrate that apoE-Sendai is directly related to lipoprotein deposition in LPG, we have introduced apoE-Sendai into apoE-deficient hypercholesterolemic mice using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. Here we provide the first evidence that apoE-Sendai is an etiological cause of LPG. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have provided direct evidence that apoE-Sendai as an etiological cause of LPG using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in apoE-deficient mice. The data presented in this study strongly suggest that dysbetalipoproteinemia manifested by severe hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with LPG is caused by the apoE-Sendai mutation. As with mice expressing apoE2, a major genetic prerequisite for dysbetalipoproteinemia (20Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Rall S.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1991; 265: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), expression of apoE-Sendai resulted in the insufficient normalization of hypercholesterolemia in apoE-deficient mice and induced high plasma levels of triglyceride. Although the mechanism of plasma triglyceride induction is currently unknown, it may be related to the hepatic uptake of plasma cholesterol by the LDL receptor. Like apoE2, apoE-Sendai exhibits a reduced binding activity for the LDL receptor, and this may lower the hepatic cholesterol pool, thereby increasing lipogenesis mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (21Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

The binding of IL-1 to interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) type 1 is the initial step in IL-1 signal transduction and therefore is a tempting target for anti-inflammatory therapeutics. To advance our understanding of IL-1R1 binding interactions, we have determined the structure of the extracellular domains of IL-1R1 bound to a 21-amino acid IL-1 antagonist peptide at 3.0-Å resolution. The antagonist peptide binds to the domain 1/2 junction of the receptor, which is a conserved binding site for IL-1β and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). This co-crystal structure also reveals that considerable flexibility is present in IL-1R1 because the carboxyl-terminal domain of the receptor is rotated almost 170° relative to the first two domains of the receptor compared with the previously solved IL-1R1·ligand structures. The structure shows an unexpected binding mode for the peptide and may contribute to the design of smaller IL-1R antagonists. Interleukin (IL-1)α and IL-1β are important mediators of inflammation.

Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased IL-1 production has been observed in patients with several autoimmune disorders, ischemia, and various cancers, therefore implicating IL-1 as a potential mediator of many diseases. IL-1α and IL-1β signal by binding to interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) type 1. The receptor-ligand complex binds IL-1R accessory protein, and the resulting receptor heterodimer transduces a cellular signal (2Cullinan E.B. Kwee L. Nunes P.D.J.S. Ju G. McIntyre K.W. Chizzonite R.A. Labow M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5614-5620PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that IL-1R family members may be implicated in processes as diverse as IL-18 binding (3Hoshino K. Tsutsui H. Takeda K. Nakanishi K. Takeda Y. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5014-5044Google Scholar) and neural development (4Born T.L. Smith D.E. Garka K.E. Renshaw B.R. Bertles J.S. Sims J.E. J. Biol.

Because of the highly inflammatory properties of IL-1, multiple control mechanisms exist to moderate the IL-1R response. These mechanisms include IL-1R2, soluble receptor fragments, and IL-1R antagonist (IL-1ra). IL-1R2 binds IL-1α and IL-1β, but does not signal, whereas proteolytically processed soluble versions of IL-1R1 and IL-1R2 bind the interleukin-1 molecules in circulation. IL-1ra is a naturally occurring antagonist that binds to IL-1R1 and that blocks the binding of IL-1α or IL-1β to IL-1R1. The IL-1R1·IL-1ra complex does not interact with IL-1R accessory protein, and so IL-1 signaling does not occur. IL-1ra shares ∼30% sequence identity with IL-1α and IL-1β (5Eisenberg S.P. Brewer M.T.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12874-12879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It also has an extremely high (150 pm) affinity for IL-1R1 (7Dripps D.J. Brandhuber B.J. Thompson R.C. Eisenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10331-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two recent studies describing IL-1ra-deficient mice further support the role of IL-1ra in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (8Nicklin M.J.H. Hughes D.E. Barton J.L. Ure J.M. Duff G.W. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Horai R. Saijo S. Tanioka H. Nakae S. Sudo K. Okahara A. Ikuse T. Asano M. Iwakura Y. J. Exp.

Ultimately, however, an orally deliverable IL-1 antagonist is desirable, which requires the discovery of a much lower molecular mass compound. Extensive searches for lower molecular mass IL-1R antagonists have been conducted; and in 1996, Yanofsky et al. (10Yanofsky S.D. Baldwin D.N. Butler J.H. Holden F.R. Jacobs J.W. Balasubramanian P. Chinn J.P. Cwirla S.E. Peters-Bhatt E. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E.H. Akeson A. Bowlin T.L. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The peptide binds to IL-1R1 with an impressively tight IC50 of 2.6 nm and, like IL-1ra, appears to be a pure receptor antagonist. To determine how the peptide binds to IL-1R1, we have co-crystallized AF10847 with IL-1R1 and solved the structure at a resolution of 3.0 Å. The extracellular portion of IL-1R1 (expressed residues Asp4–Thr315 for full-length IL-1R1 or Asp4–Lys205 for two-domain IL-1R1) (11Sims J.E. Acres R.B. Grubin C.E. McMahan C.J. Wignall J.M.

Approximately 68 h after infection, the media were harvested, centrifuged, and loaded onto an IL-1ra/Affi-Gel 15 affinity column. The receptor was eluted at room temperature using a gradient from pH 5.0 to 2.5 containing 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.2 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% CHAPS. The fractions were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 9.0). The IL-1R1 fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.25% CHAPS. The protein was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the dialysis buffer. The monomer-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored frozen at −70 °C. IL-1R1 (3.3 mg/ml) and AF10847 (synthesized by standard solid-phase synthesis) were incubated for 2 h on ice at a 1:2 molar ratio, and crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C. 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 mammonium sulfate, and 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) were used as the precipitant. Crystals were cryoprotected with 90% precipitant and 10% ethylene glycol. All diffraction data were collected at 120 K on a Rigaku RU-H3R generator with an R-AxisII image plate detector (Molecular Structure Corp., The Woodlands, TX). The heavy atom derivative was prepared by soaking with 1 mmK2PtCl4 overnight at 4 °C. X-ray diffraction data were processed using HKL, Denzo, and Scalepack (12Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. Science and Engineering Research Council Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993Google Scholar). Molecular replacement solutions (either for single or multiple domains) were generated by Amore (13Collaborative Computational Research Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and evaluated by Xplor (14Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar), but no good solutions were found. Heavy atom data were therefore collected on a K2PtCl4 derivative. The heavy atom Patterson map was solved by hand, and Siras phases were calculated with Mlphare (13Collaborative Computational Research Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). No solvent flattening was employed. The positions of the three receptor domains were found using Essens (15Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) to search the Siras map with polyalanine models of each domain individually. Refinement of the structure was carried out using Xplor, and the peptide was built using O (16Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). In view of the somewhat low resolution of the molecular replacement structure (3.0 Å), no water molecules were added to the structure. Changes in solvent-accessible area were computed using Xplor following the method of Lee and Richards (17Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5360) Google Scholar), making the assumption that the protein structures were unchanged upon ligand binding. Hydrogen bonds were assigned using Xplor to find nitrogen-oxygen pairs separated by <3.5 Å. Figures were prepared using Ribbons (18Carson M. Bugg C.E. J. Mol. Graphics. 1986; 4: 121-122Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or InsightII (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). Binding of AF10847 to both full-length extracellular IL-1R1 and two-domain IL-1R1 was evaluated using BIAcore 2000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) (19Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). IL-1R1 was immobilized on the sensor surface by amine coupling. Binding of the peptide was analyzed over a concentration range of 3–200 nm at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% polysorbate 20 (Biacore). Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated using BIAevaluation software. Peptide AF10847 was co-crystallized with the extracellular domains of IL-1R1. The crystals were space group P6522 with unit cell dimensions a =b = 95.90 Å, c = 208.02 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ = 120°. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 3.0 Å, and the data collection statistics are shown in Table I. We attempted to solve the complex structure by molecular replacement, starting from the structure of IL-1R1 in complex with either IL-1β or IL-1ra. Search models were constructed using either all atoms or a polyalanine trace for the whole molecule, for the first two domains, or for single domains. We searched for possible solutions with Amore and Xplor using multiple resolution ranges, but all attempts to find a convincing solution failed.Table ICrystallographic data and refinement statisticsData setNativeK2PtC4Resolution (Å)3.03.0No. of unique reflections11,89411,701No. of observations125,32067,989R sym10.310.8 (Last shell)(36.9)(38.8)Completeness 1-aI> = 2o-cutoff.

Open table in a new tab We therefore decided to collect anomalous heavy atom data using a K2PtCl4 derivative that had worked well for the IL-1R1·IL-1β complex. The resulting Siras map was then searched in real space using Essens to locate each of the three domains of IL-1R1 individually. Even though the phasing power of the Siras derivative was very weak (Table I), the three domains of IL-1R1 were successfully located individually in the IL-1R1·peptide electron density map. At this point, it became quite obvious why the molecular replacement attempts had failed: a rotation of almost 170° had occurred between the third domain relative to the first two (compare Figs.1 and 2). After refinement of IL-1R1, the peptide structure was determined. In the final structure, the root mean square deviation from ideality is 0.0121 Å for bond lengths and 1.91° for bond angles. One residue of IL-1R1 (Glu203) lies in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. This residue is at the sharpest part of the turn joining the second and third domains of IL-1R1.

We previously reported the structure of IL-1β complexed with IL-1R1 and showed that both binding sites on IL-1β bind to a single receptor (23Vigers G.P.A. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One site of IL-1β, referred to as Site A, binds at the junction of the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains of IL-1R1, whereas the second binding site of IL-1β (Site B) binds to the third domain of IL-1R1 (Fig. 1). This domain wraps around IL-1β and is connected to the first two domains by an 8-residue flexible linker. Schreuder et al. (24Schreuder H. Tardif C. Trump-Kallmeyer S. Soffientini A. Sarubbi E. Akeson A. Bowlin T. Yanofsky S. Barrett R.W. Nature. 1997; 386: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) have likewise solved the structure of IL-1ra bound to IL-1R1. Their structure shows that the single binding site of IL-1ra binds to Site A of IL-1R1 in a manner very similar to that of IL-1β. The third domain of IL-1R1, however, swings 20o away from IL-1ra by means of the flexible linker and makes very few contacts with IL-1ra (Fig. 1). These two x-ray structures confirmed the mutagenesis results and suggest that blocking either binding site of IL-1R1 with a small organic molecule or peptide might lead to a useful receptor antagonist. The structure of the IL-1R1·AF10847 complex is shown in Fig.2. IL-1R1 has three well defined immunoglobulin-like domains, as expected from the previously solved IL-1R1 complex structures. However, in this structure, the C-terminal domain is rotated ∼170° relative to its position in the previous complexes. This rotation means that Site B now points away from the ligand, rather than toward it. Meanwhile, the peptide binds in a manner entirely distinct from that of IL-1β and IL-1ra. Residues 6–13 form a short α-helix that binds at Site A of IL-1R1 in the domain 1/2 junction, whereas the N- and C-terminal residues of AF10847 form strands that interact with residues along the sides of the first two domains of the receptor. This complex is considerably more compact than the previous receptor complexes reported, with approximate dimensions of 60 × 52 × 35 Å. The three domains of IL-1R1 appear to be quite rigid. Comparing the x-ray structures of IL-1R1·AF10847 and IL-1R1·IL-1β, the domains are very similar, with root mean square deviations of 1.71, 1.92, and 0.937 Å for residues 8–98, 124–198, and 207–311 of IL-1R1, respectively. The largest changes seen in the structure of IL-1R1 are in residues 113–121 and 199–208. Residues 113–121 form a loop between strands b and c in the second domain of the receptor (23Vigers G.P.A. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Since Lys112 and Lys114 of IL-1R1 make hydrogen bonds with the peptide (TableII), it is likely that this change in conformation is due to the binding of the peptide to IL-1R1. Interestingly, Lys114 makes contacts with all three ligands solved to date, but the contacts are not the same in all three cases (Table II). Residues 199–208 form the flexible linker that joins the second and third immunoglobulin domains and clearly have to move to allow the third domain to take up its dramatically different orientation.Table IIListing of hydrogen bonds between IL-1R1 and the three ligands (inferred from Xplor)IL-1R1AF10847 peptideIL-1βIL-1raNo.ResidueAtomNo.ResidueAtomNo.ResidueAtomNo.ResidueAtom11GluOɛ27LysNζ26ArgNɛ12LysNζ25LeuO14IleN39AsnOδ14IleO34GlnNɛ39AsnNδ16ValN15GlnOɛ32GlnOɛ36GlnOɛ16ValO15GlnNɛ32GlnNɛ36GlnNɛ95LysNζ19LeuO95LysNζ20ProO108GlnOɛ19LeuN109AlaO15GlnNɛ32GlnNɛ36GlnNɛ110IleO33GlyN37Glyn112LysN14TrpO112LysNζ17TyrOH112LysO14TrpN114LysN12TyrO20GlnOɛ114LysNζ11ArgNH114LysNζ11ArgNH114LysO15GlnNɛ20GlnNɛ114LysO16TrpNɛ122GlyO15GlnNɛ20GlnNɛ124ValO13TyrOH127TyrN9SerOδ128GluOɛ127TyrOH10AsnOδ128AspOδ127TyrOH34TyrO129GluOɛ6TrpN128GluN127AlaN163ArgNɛ14GlnOɛ163ArgNH1GluOɛ18ValO204AsnNδ108AsnOδ234ThrOγ12TyrOH237LeuO4ArgNH238SerOγ11GlnOɛ250IleO93LysNζ252GluOɛ93LysN252GluOɛ94LysN259GluOɛ93LysNζ260AspGδ1AlaN261TyrN1AlaO261TyrOH93LysNζ263SerOγ4ArgNH271ArgNH150GluOɛ298LysNζ51GluOɛ299AsnO53ProN300ThrO54HisN300ThrOγ105GluOɛResidues in IL-1R1 that make identical bonds to all three ligands are shown in boldface, whereas those that make non-identical bonds to all three are shown in italics.

Comparing the IL-1R1·AF10847 complex with the previously solved IL-1R1·IL-1ra complex, the first domain of IL-1R1 has rotated 5° with respect to the second domain (the rotation is 2° in the IL-1β complex structure), whereas the third domain has rotated 168°. The C-terminal strand of the third domain of IL-1R1 now touches the N-terminal strand of the first domain. Residues 7–13 of IL-1R1 now form an antiparallel β-sheet with residues 216–220. The two strands have seven hydrogen bonds linking them, which presumably serve to stabilize the structure. This arrangement of the first and third domains of the receptor was unexpected. Despite numerous experimental attempts to determine whether this new IL-1R conformation is physiologically relevant, we have been unable to determine whether this arrangement occurs in the free receptor or is due to peptide binding, to the low pH used to grow the crystals, or to crystal packing forces. In view of the extensive hydrogen-bonding pattern observed between the amino and carboxyl termini of IL-1R1, it is tempting to speculate that this arrangement of the IL-1R1 domains may have physiological significance in preventing the binding of any of the natural IL-1R ligands and that this may be yet another mechanism to modulate IL-1 responses. Because the peptide binds to the same binding site as IL-1ra and IL-1β and because the three IL-1R1 domains are quite rigid, one might expect that the AF10847 peptide would have a structure similar to that of IL-1β or IL-1ra and make similar contacts. This, however, is not the case (Fig.3). The peptide forms an α-helix (residues 6–13) through the binding “groove” of the receptor, whereas β-strands in the protein ligands interact with this receptor binding site. The peptide also positions long strands along the sides of IL-1R1 (residues 1–5 and 14–21), which have no analogue in the natural IL-1 proteins. Most of the residues in these two strands probably do not directly interfere with the binding of IL-1, but instead provide binding energy to hold the α-helical section of the peptide in the groove of the receptor. We speculate that possibly one or both of the long “tails” of the peptide initially bind to IL-1R1, after which the α-helical segment can form and block subsequent IL-1 binding. All three ligands have approximately equal solvent-accessible areas buried at Site A of IL-1R1, with 1301, 1164, and 1009Å2 for AF10847, IL-1ra, and IL-1β, respectively. However, as shown in Table II and Figs. 3 and4, only 1 residue is closely conserved among AF10847, IL-1β, and IL-1ra. This residue (Gln15 in AF10847, Gln32 in IL-1β, and Gln36 in IL-1ra) makes multiple hydrogen bonds to IL-1R1 and was previously identified by mutagenesis studies as being essential for receptor binding (22Evans R.J. Bray J. Childs J.D. Vigers G.P.A. Brandhuber B.J. Skalicky J.J. Thompson R.C. Eisenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11477-11483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, other “essential” residues such as Gln15 in IL-1ra (Gln20 in IL-1β) have no analogue in the peptide.Figure 4IL-1R1 binding site surfaces.Illustrated is the solvent-accessible surface of Site A of the receptor, showing all residues of the ligands with >30.0-Å2 change in solvent accessibility upon complex formation.

As shown in Table III and Fig. 4, most of the residues in the peptide either make hydrogen bonds to IL-1R1 or bury a large amount of their surface area at the receptor-ligand interface. Only 6 of the 21 residues have no hydrogen bonds to the receptor and bury <40 Å2 at the receptor. Four of these (Glu7, Glu8, Ser9, and Ala11) are in the α-helix of the peptide and probably confer solubility to the peptide and keep the helix in register. Pro16 is not in the helix, but serves to redirect the peptide so that the long strand of residues 14–21 lies along the side of IL-1R1. Residues Thr2 and Thr5 seem less important since they lie in the N-terminal part of the peptide that shows fewer interactions with the receptor (Table II).Table IIIAF10847 peptide interactions with IL-1R1AF10847 sequenceBuried areaSide chain hydrogen bondBackbone hydrogen bondÅ21E402T3P744F73*5T276W188*7E8E9S38**10N24*11A1512Y57*13Y137*14W67*15Q113*16P3817Y109*18A4619L46*20P25*21L139Surface area buried per residue is listed.

Open table in a new tab Surface area buried per residue is listed. Main chain and side chain hydrogen bonds from the peptide to the receptor are denoted with an asterisk. Residues in the α-helical portion of the peptide are shown in boldface. Our structural results are consistent with the three high affinity peptides found by panning phage display libraries as described by Yanofsky et al. (10Yanofsky S.D. Baldwin D.N. Butler J.H. Holden F.R. Jacobs J.W. Balasubramanian P. Chinn J.P. Cwirla S.E. Peters-Bhatt E. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E.H. Akeson A. Bowlin T.L. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7381-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These peptides showed considerable variability in the first 12 residues (the N-terminal strand and the α-helix) and a strict conservation of the last 9 residues (the C-terminal strand). Synthetically prepared peptides containing truncations of the amino terminus of AF10847 showed that removal of the first 3 residues did not significantly reduce the affinity of the peptide for the receptor, but removal of Phe4 from this peptide resulted in at least a 30-fold decrease in affinity. Approximately 70 Å2 of Phe4 are buried in the receptor complex, and one hydrogen bond is formed; but Phe4is probably also required to position Trp6 into a deep pocket of the receptor. The 9 C-terminal residues are highly conserved and form 10 of the 16 hydrogen bonds between the peptide and receptor. A further indication of the importance of this portion of the peptide is that AF10847 does not bind to murine IL-1R: 5 of the 10 hydrogen bonds formed between the C-terminal portion of the peptide and human IL-1R1 are made at Lys95 and Lys112. In murine IL-1R1, these residues are threonine and proline, which implies that the hydrogen-bonding pattern is unlikely to be maintained. Even though the crystal structure indicates that the third domain of the receptor touches the peptide, we do not believe that much binding energy is contributed by this interaction. In the x-ray structure, the only hydrogen bond with the third domain is from the OH of Tyr12, and only 115 Å2 are buried at the third domain. Comparison of the sequences of the three high affinity peptides of Yanofsky et al. (10Yanofsky S.D. Baldwin D.N. Butler J.H. Holden F.R. Jacobs J.W. Balasubramanian P. Chinn J.P. Cwirla S.E. Peters-Bhatt E. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E.H. Akeson A. Bowlin T.L. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7381-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) shows that either glycine or arginine at this position results in tight receptor binding. We have also determined the apparent association and dissociation rates of AF10847 by BIAcore measurements (data not shown) on both full-length IL-1R1 (Asp1–Thr315) and a truncated version of the receptor containing the first two domains of IL-1R1 (Asp1–Lys205). The association rates were 9.8 × 105 and 9.9 × 105m−1 s−1, respectively, whereas the dissociation rates were 5.8 × 10−3 and 6.0 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. Because both the association and dissociation rates are virtually identical, the interactions of the peptide with the third domain of the receptor appear to be kinetically negligible. IL-1R1 is remarkably pleiotropic in that it binds to three different naturally occurring 20-kDa protein ligands with high affinity, even though they share <30% homology. In addition, IL-1R also binds with nanomolar affinity to a 21-amino acid peptide that has a completely different secondary structure than any of the natural ligands. Comparisons of these structures show that both natural ligands and the peptide antagonist interact with the receptor in the junction area of domains 1 and 2, but that neither IL-1ra nor the peptide interacts with the second binding site located in the third receptor domain. The structure shows an unexpected binding mode for the peptide, with it being in a mainly extended conformation with a central short helical section. The interactions with the receptor are not well conserved between the ligands and therefore provide new insights into IL-1R1 interactions to aid in the design of smaller IL-1 antagonists."

Because these organisms are able to degrade polychlorinated biphenyls, xenobiotic compounds known as one of the most serious environmental pollutants, biochemical and genetic bases of polychlorinated biphenyl degradation have been extensively studied by many workers. The biphenyl/polychlorinated biphenyls degradative genes, termed bph, were first cloned fromPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 (1Furukawa K. Miyazaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 392-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Furukawa K. Arimura N. Miyazaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 427-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S.

The bph gene cluster of KF707 is organized as(orf0)bphA1A2(orf3)bphA3A4BCX0X1X2X3D (Fig.1). The bphA1 andbphA2 genes encode a large subunit and a small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, respectively, bphA3 encodes a ferredoxin, and bphA4 encodes a ferredoxin reductase. These four gene products associate to form a multicomponent biphenyl dioxygenase that is involved in the initial oxygenation of the biphenyl ring. The bphB gene encodes a biphenyl dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. The bphC gene encodes a 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (23DHBP)1 dioxygenase that is involved in the ring meta-cleavage. The bphD gene encodes a 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate (HOPD) hydrolase to obtain benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate. The bphX0gene encodes a putative glutathione S-transferase, but the role of this enzyme is yet unknown in the catabolism of biphenyl. ThebphX1, bphX2, and bphX3 genes, encoding 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, respectively, are involved in the catabolism of 2-hydroxy-penta-2,4-dienoate to acetyl coenzyme A (Fig. 1). The roles of orf0 andorf3 in this operon remain to be elucidated.Figure 5Primer extension analysis of orf0and RT-PCR analysis of RNA transcripts.

Recently, it was suggested that thebph gene cluster in Tn4371 found fromRalstonia eutropha A5, bphEFGA1A2A3BCD, forms an operon transcribed from a ς70 promoter and that thebphS gene product negatively regulates the transcription of the bph gene cluster as a repressor (18Mouz S. Merlin C. Springael D. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the bph operon in Gram-positive Rhodococcus sp. M5, bpdC1C2BADEF, is regulated by the two-component signal transduction system of bpdS and bpdT. Thesebpd genes are inducibly transcribed by biphenyl. In this system, BpdS and BpdT function as a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator, respectively (19Labbe D. Garnon J. Lau P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2772-2776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the versatile transcription of the KF707 bph gene cluster, indicating that the ORF0 protein is an activator and is absolutely involved in the expressions of its own orf0 and bphX0X1X2X3D and that at least six transcriptional initiation sites are present in the KF707 bph gene cluster.

Strain KF707 and the derivatives were pregrown in BSM supplemented with biphenyl or succinate for 24 h, and the one hundredth culture was transferred to the same fresh medium to grow to the stationary phase. Cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell (Ohtake Co., Tokyo) and centrifuged at 14,700 ×g for 30 min; the supernatant was used as the crude extract. BphC (23DHBP dioxygenase) and BphD (HOPD hydrolase) activities were assayed as described previously (1Furukawa K. Miyazaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 392-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of BphC activity was defined as the amount of enzyme to produce 1 μmol of biphenyl ringmeta-cleavage compound (HOPD)/min. One unit of BphD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme to degrade 1 μmol of HOPD/min. BphX0 (glutathione S-transferase) and BphX2 (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) activities were measured as described by Habig and Jakoby (21Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 77: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar) and Shingler et al. (22Shingler V. Powlowski J. Marklund U. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 711-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrooket al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared by the rapid alkaline procedure. The DNA fragments to be sequenced were cloned into pUC19 (Takara Shuzo) or pBluescriptII® SK(−) (Stratagene). By using appropriate primers (Sawady Technology Co., Tokyo), transcriptional initiation sites were determined by the primer extension method. RNA preparation was performed for the cells grown to anA 600 of 0.7 as described by Ausubelet al. (24Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.D. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Unit 4.4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). The concentration and purity of the RNA were estimated from theA 260/A 280 ratio and from the RNA bands on formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel electrophoresis. Primer extension was performed with the primer extension kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). The primers used in this study were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo). A 20–50-μg aliquot of total RNA was used in each primer extension reaction. The end-labeled primers were complementary to 23–24-bp sequences located 22–23 nucleotides downstream of the first nucleotides of the orf0,bphX1, and bphD start codon, respectively. In the analysis of bphX0, we used the following primer: 5′-CGTAAGGGCGACGGTTTTGCGTAAGTA-3′ (in bphC coding sequence). Signal intensities were quantified with a densitometer using Bio-PROFIL, version 6.0 (Vilber Lourmat). RT-PCR was performed using the RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (TOYOBO, Osaka). For the detection of the orf0-mRNA, the following primers were used for 8 μg of total RNA: 5′-ATGAATACGAGAACTCCAAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTGACCTCATAGCGC-3′ within orf0 coding sequence. To examine whether orf0 and bphA1 could be co-transcribed, the following primers encompassing the both genes were used: 5′-CGAGATGCCGAGCGCTGT-3′ within orf0 coding sequence and 5′-CTTCTTTGATTGATGAGCTCAT-3′ within bphA1 coding sequence. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis through 2.0% agarose gel. The orf0of KF707 was amplified from chromosomal DNA using the following primers: 5′-AGCTCCATGGGAATGAATACG-AGAACTCCAAGCGGC-3′ for the forward sequence, where the NcoI site is underlined and the start codon ATG is in bold type. For the reverse primer sequence, 5′-AAGGCTGTCGACCCTCAACAAACCGAATTCCCGAAC-3′ was used, where the SalI site is underlined. Amplification oforf0 was carried out for 25 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min; primer annealing, 52 °C for 1.5 min; and primer extension, 72 °C for 1.5 min. The PCR products were digested by NcoI and SalI and inserted at the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET32b(+) (Novagen), which contains an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter. The orf0 was designed to be fused to Trx (thioredoxin protein)·Tag™, S·Tag™, and His·Tag® at 5′ end and His·Tag® at the 3′ end. The resulting plasmid, pET32b(+)-orf0 (pTWF3), was transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen). TheE. coli BL21 (DE3) (pTWF3) was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) to obtain anA 600 of 0.6. Expression of the proteins was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were then suspended in cold 50 mm MOPS buffer containing 5% (v/v) glycerol and disrupted by a French pressure cell (Ohtake). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The matrix was washed twice with buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole). The proteins were eluted with the same buffer, containing 250 mm imidazole. Protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Cell extracts ofPseudomonas strains were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Trans-Blot® Transfer Medium (Bio-Rad). Anti-ORF0 antibody was prepared by the method described by Imajoh-Ohmi et al. (25Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tsujimura K. Inagaki M. Koupeputidokoutaijikken purotokohru ( in Japanese ). Shujunsha, Tokyo1994: 47-118Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using anti-ORF0 antibody was carried out to detect the expression of ORF0 protein in KF707 by the method described by Imajoh-Ohmi et al. (25Imajoh-Ohmi S. Tsujimura K. Inagaki M. Koupeputidokoutaijikken purotokohru ( in Japanese ). Shujunsha, Tokyo1994: 47-118Google Scholar). Signal intensities were quantified with a densitometer. The TcR gene (4.3 kb) was removed from pSUP102::Tn5-B30 (20Furukawa K. Hayashida S. Taira K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 98: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Simon R. Quandt J. Klipp W. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 80: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) byXhoI digestion. A 2.5-kb SalI fragment containing the orf0 gene was inserted into the XhoI site of pSUP102::Tn5-B30ΔTcR. Because the resultant plasmid has the unique XhoI site in the middle of the inserted fragment, a purified TcR gene from pSUP102::Tn5-B30 was then inserted into theXhoI site within orf0 to generate pSUPB101 (TableI). pSUPB101 containing orf0 disrupted by the TcR gene was introduced into E. coli S17–1 (27Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-790Crossref Scopus (5658) Google Scholar) by transformation. Southern blot analysis was performed using the DIG DNA Labeling and Detection Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Roche Diagnostics). The chromosomal DNA of the Pseudomonas strains listed in Table I were digested withXhoI and subjected to electrophoresis through 1.0% agarose gels. The digested DNA fragments were transferred onto Biodyne® B (PALL). Hybridization was performed with the DIG-11-dUTP-labeledBamHI-EcoRI fragment (3.9 kb) from pSUP102::Tn5-B30 vector as a probe. RNase protection assay was performed using the RNase protection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). The RNA probe used in this assay was labeled with DIG-11-UTP by the methods of in vitrotranscription using the DIG RNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics). The probe for the bphX0-mRNA was prepared by cloning aClaI-PstI fragment containing bphC andbphX0 into pBluescriptII® KS(+) to create pTWF7, which was then linearized with HincII to use as a probe. The following two oligonucleotides were synthesized and annealed to obtain the DNA sequence of theorf0 operator region: 5′-CCGATAAATATAAATATCGATTATCGACATTTTTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTCAAAAATGTCGATAATCGATATTTATATTTATCGG-3′. The DIG oligonucleotide 3′-end labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics) was used for labeling and binding reaction. The reaction mixtures (33 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 6 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.8 pmol of DIG-11-ddUTP-labeled DNA, and 0–20 μg of purified ORF0 protein. When necessary, 100 pmol of cold target DNA fragment, 100 pmol of unrelated DNA (5′-AAGGCTCTCGAGCCTCAACAAACCGAATTCCCGAAC-3′), 1 mm of 23DHBP (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka), or 1 mm of HOPD was added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the mixtures were fractionated by electrophoresis at 150 V constant voltage in 8% polyacrylamide gel with cold TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA). E. coli JM109 carrying pTWF6 (pTV118N-orf0) or pTV118N was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside overnight. The cells were then suspended in EDTA- and dithiothreitol-free binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol) and disrupted by a French pressure cell (Ohtake). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose and incubated on ice for 1 h. The matrix was washed twice with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole). The proteins were eluted with the same buffer, containing 250 mm imidazole. Protein (purified ORF0) was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. KF7095 (orf0-disruptant, Table I) was grown in BSM supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) sodium succinate and Tc (30 μg/ml) overnight. After centrifugation, the cells were suspended in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and 0.2% (w/v) of 23DHBP was added to the cell suspension. After 2 h of incubation, cells were removed by centrifugation at 14,700 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filter-sterilized and stocked at −80 °C until use. It was previously shown thatorf0 is not directly responsible for the enzymatic activity of biphenyl dioxygenase (encoded by bphA1A2A3A4) (28Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3936-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Theorf0 encoded a putative protein of 245 amino acids, and the data base search revealed that the ORF0 protein shares 28% identity to GntR, a regulatory protein known as the transcriptional repressor of the gluconate operon in Bacillus subtilis (29Fujita Y. Fujita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These two proteins exhibited a high similarity of amino acid sequence in the N-terminal region (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, a helix-turn-helix motif involved in DNA-binding was predicted in the N-terminal region of ORF0 (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, ORF0 was considered to be a possible regulatory protein belonging to the GntR family (30Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To investigate the function, we disrupted orf0 in strain KF707. For this purpose, the plasmid pSUPB101 in which the TcR gene was inserted in orf0 was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E. coliS17–1 cells carrying pSUPB101 were filter-mated with KF707 overnight. pSUPB101 cannot replicate in Pseudomonas strains; therefore, single cross-over recombinants were first screened on BSM agar plates supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) succinate, Tc (30 μg/ml), and gentamicin (20 μg/ml). Such single cross-over recombinants were repeatedly subcultured in LB broth to obtain double cross-over recombinants. These were checked for growth on BSM plates supplemented with succinate, Tc, and gentamicin. The loss of the vector-borne gentamicin resistance gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). Strain KF7095 (orf0-disruptant) failed to grow on biphenyl and accumulated large amounts of the biphenyl ringmeta-cleavage yellow compound (HOPD) (Fig.3). In the case of strain KF707 (wild type), HOPD accumulated temporarily, but reduced gradually because of the conversion to benzoic acid by the BphD enzyme (HOPD hydrolase). These results strongly suggested that the bphA1A2A3A4BCgenes are expressed in KF7095, but the bphD gene is not. We previously obtained the following KF707 transposon mutant strains; KF730 in which Tn5-B21 is inserted inbphA1 (bphA1::Tn5-B21), KF748 in which Tn5-B21 is inserted in bphB(bphB::Tn5-B21), and KF744 in which Tn5-B21 is inserted in bphC(bphC::Tn5-B21) (20Furukawa K. Hayashida S. Taira K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 98: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using these transposon mutants and the orf0-disruptant (KF7095), we measured the enzyme activities of BphC, BphX0, BphX2, and BphD (Fig.4). No activity of BphC (23DHBP dioxygenase) was detected in KF730 because the bphB andbphC genes were not expressed by a polar effect of Tn5-B21 inserted in the bphA1 gene. Likewise, no activity of BphC in KF748 and KF744 was detected. These mutants failed to grow on biphenyl. However, these three strains exhibited the enzyme activities of BphX0 (glutathione S-transferase), BphX2 (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), and BphD (HOPD hydrolase). More interestingly, the KF7095 (orf0-disruptant) exhibited the BphC activity but no BphX0, BphX2, nor BphD activity. The same strain accumulated large amounts of the biphenyl ring meta-cleavage yellow compound (HOPD) (Fig. 3). These results suggest that thebphA1A2(orf3)A3A4BC and the bphX0X1X2X3D are independently transcribed. Based on the enzyme assays using KF7095, it was indicated that there are at least two different expression systems in the bph gene clusters in KF707. One is theorf0-independent system for the expression of thebphA1A2(orf3)bphA3A4BC genes, and the other is theorf0-dependent system for the expression of thebphX region and bphD genes. To examine how the orf0 is transcribed, we performed primer extension analysis. One transcriptional initiation site was found at 106 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of orf0 (Fig.5 A). The possible promoter sequence was assigned to TTGACA (−35 region) and TAAGTT (−10 region) (Fig. 5 B). This promoter sequence is similar to the consensus sequence of the E. coliς70-dependent promoter. The extension signal from the biphenyl-grown cells (Fig. 5 A, lane B) was much (2.5 times) stronger than that of the succinate-grown cells (Fig. 5 A, lane S), indicating that the transcription of orf0 is induced by biphenyl. We also performed Northern blot analysis using antisense orf0 RNA probe but failed to obtain a clear signal corresponding to theorf0 (data not shown). In addition, we performed RT-PCR against the total RNAs of KF707 and KF7095 using the primers designed to anneal the orf0-coding region from the start codon to the upstream of the uniqueXhoI site in which the TcR gene is inserted in KF7095. The results clearly show that 200-bp RT-PCR products were detected when KF707 was grown on either biphenyl or succinate (Fig.5 C, lanes 1 and 2). The amount of RT-PCR product was much higher in the biphenyl-grown cells than that of the succinate-grown cells. However, no amplified DNA was detected in KF7095 (Fig. 5 C, lane 3). The result clearly indicated that orf0 is not transcribed in KF7095. We also performed RT-PCR to examine whether orf0 andbphA1 are co-transcribed using the primers encompassing the both genes, but no amplified DNA was detected (Fig. 5 C,lane 4). This result indicated that orf0 andbphA1 are independently transcribed. We were successful in expressing the ORF0 protein as His-tagged form in E. coli. After purification, we prepared antibody against the ORF0 protein. Using the anti-ORF0 antibody, we detected the ORF0 protein of 27.7 kDa in size from KF707 cell extracts by Western blot analysis (Fig.6). These data allowed us to conclude that orf0 is absolutely expressed in KF707. The signal from the biphenyl-grown cells (Fig. 6, lane 1) was much stronger (3.1 times) than that of succinate-grown cells, indicating that the expression of ORF0 is induced in the presence of biphenyl. This is consistent with the result obtained in the primer extension analysis and the RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5, A and C). The results obtained in primer extension analysis and Western analysis strongly indicated that orf0 is inducibly expressed in the presence of biphenyl (Figs. 5 A and 6). In addition, the ORF0 protein could be considered to be a regulatory protein in the KF707bph operon because ORF0 exhibits a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif in the N-terminal half (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the sequence boxed in Fig. 5 B could be a possible ORF0-binding region (termed an operator region). This sequence is located between the transcriptional initiation site and the start codon of orf0 and is similar to the binding sites of some GntR-type regulators such as AphS in the aph operon of a phenol-degrader Comamonas testosteroni TA441 (Fig.7 and Ref. 31Arai H. Akahira S. Ohishi T. Kudo T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To confirm whether ORF0 directly binds to the operator region, we performed gel shift assay. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a 38-bp fragment located between the transcriptional initiation site and start codon of orf0 was labeled with DIG-11-ddUTP. The ORF0 protein fused to His·Tag® at the C terminus was expressed in E. coli carrying pTV118N-orf0(pTWF6). The purified ORF0 protein (28 kDa) was used in gel shift assay. When the ORF0 protein was mixed with the labeled DNA fragment, its mobility was retarded (Fig. 8,shifted band I in lane 2). The labeled DNA fragment was not shifted when an excess amount of cold target DNA was added (Fig. 8, lane 3). The addition of an unrelated DNA did not affect the binding of ORF0 to the target DNA (Fig. 8, lane 6). The shifted band was not detected when the cell extract ofE. coli carrying pTV118N was used as a control (Fig. 8,lane 7). These results strongly indicated that the ORF0 protein specifically binds to the operator region that lies between its transcriptional initiation site and the start codon. More interestingly, in the presence of biphenyl-metabolites such as 23DHBP and HOPD, the retardation of shifted bands were much more notable, and the signal intensities were stronger, particularly in the presence of HOPD (Fig. 8, shifted band II in lanes 4 and 5). These observations indicated that the ORF0 protein strongly binds to the operator region in the presence of biphenyl-metabolites. Because KF7095 did not have any enzyme activities of BphX0, BphX2, and BphD (Fig. 4), it is conceivable that there are at least two independent transcripts of bphA1A2(orf3)A3A4BC andbphX0X1X2X3D. The transcriptional initiation site was found far upstream of 452 nucleotides from the start codon ofbphX0 (Fig. 9 A,lane B). This site lies within the center of the coding sequence of bphC. No extension signal was detected when the cells were grown in the absence of biphenyl (Fig. 9 A,lane S), indicating that the expression of bphX0is induced by biphenyl or its metabolites. In the case of KF7095, a faint band was detected (Fig. 9 A, lane M), but this was concluded to be an artificial band from the following experiments. Using the antisense RNA probe of bphX0 (Fig.9 C), we performed RNase protection assay to detect the mRNA of bphX0. As shown in Fig. 9 B, the mRNA of bphX0 was detected in KF707 but not in KF7095. Furthermore, we did primer extension analysis using the primer complementary to the sequence located 24 nucleotides downstream of thebphX0 start codon. No extension signal was detected in KF7095 (data not shown). These results were consistent with the fact that no BphX0 enzyme activity is detected and allowed us to conclude that bphX0 is not expressed in KF7095 and thatorf0 is involved in the transcription ofbphX0. Further primer extension analyses revealed one transcriptional initiation site at 48 nucleotides upstream of the start codon ofbphX1 (Fig. 10 A,lane B). However, no signal was detected from succinate-grown cells (Fig. 10 A, lane S) nor from KF7095 (Fig. 10 A, lane M). These results suggest that BphX1 is induced by biphenyl or its metabolites and that theorf0 product is absolutely required in the expression. In addition, two transcriptional initiation sites were found at 30 and 29 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of bphD (Fig.10 B, lane B). The other faint bands detected in lane B were ignored because they were not detected in several primer extension analyses. These two extension signals were detected, but weakly, even in the absence of biphenyl (Fig. 10 B,lane S). The intensities of the extension signals detected in the presence of biphenyl (Fig. 10 B, lane B) were much stronger (2.7 times) than those in the absence of biphenyl (Fig. 10 B, lane S), indicating that bphD is inducibly transcribed in the presence of biphenyl and its metabolites. On the other hand, KF7095 exhibited no extension signal of the bphD gene (Fig. 10 B,lane M), indicating that orf0 is absolutely required for the expression of bphD as in the case ofbphX0 and bphX1. In this study, it was found that the ORF0 protein belonging to the GntR family is involved in the regulation of the bph operon in P. pseudoalcaligenes KF707. The orf0 was inducibly expressed in the presence of biphenyl (Figs. 5 Aand 6). It was further demonstrated that ORF0 itself directly binds to the operator region (Figs. 5 B, 7, and 8) by gel shift assays. The retardation was greatly enhanced in the presence of biphenyl ring meta-cleavage compound (HOPD) (Fig. 8). These results indicate that the ORF0 protein may change the conformation in the presence of HOPD and strongly binds to the operator region and promotes the transcription of its own gene. It was first reported that the GntR protein negatively regulates thegnt operon in B. subtilis (29Fujita Y. Fujita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4524-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The GntR-type regulatory proteins involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds are also reported to be repressors (18Mouz S. Merlin C. Springael D. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Arai H. Akahira S. Ohishi T. Kudo T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, ORF0 in KF707 is not likely to be a repressor (silencer) but more likely to be an activator being required for the expression of the lower pathway genes of bphX0X1X2X3D (Figs. 4, 9 B and 10(A and B)). We have preliminary data demonstrating that ORF0 protein also binds to the upstream region (about 200 bp) of bphX0 andbphX1, respectively (data not shown). Thus, it seems that ORF0 controls its own expression and acts as an activator for the expression of bphX0X1X2X3D. However, the same protein is not involved in the expression of the bphA1A2(orf3)bphA3A4BCgenes, because the orf0-disruptant (KF7095) converts biphenyl to the HOPD (Fig. 3), indicating that these genes are expressed without the ORF0 protein. Along with this finding, we previously reported that one transcriptional initiation site is located 104 nucleotides upstream of the start codon of bphA1 (3Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the result obtained in RT-PCR (Fig. 5, lane 4) revealed that no mRNA encompassing both orf0 andbphA1 is present. These results allowed us to conclude that the orf0 is transcribed alone but not co-transcribed with other degradative genes. The bphS and aphSregulatory genes are independently transcribed with respect to their degradative genes (18Mouz S. Merlin C. Springael D. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 790-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Arai H. Akahira S. Ohishi T. Kudo T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the gntR gene in the gnt operon of B. subtilis is inducibly co-transcribed with the other genes. In this case the expression of the GntR repressor is posttranscriptionally regulated (32Fujita Y. Fujita T. Miwa Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 267: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this and the previous studies (3Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

These results revealed that thebph gene cluster has at least six transcriptional initiation sites, including two for the bphD gene. It was reported previously that three transcriptional initiation sites are found upstream of bphA in Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400 whose bph gene cluster is nearly identical to that of KF707 (6Erickson B.D. Mondello F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transcription and regulation of LB400 bphgenes have not yet been studied in detail since then. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, KF7095 expressed BphC but not BphX0, BphX2, and BphD. Primer extension analysis identified the transcriptional initiation site upstream of bphX0 in wild type KF707 (Fig.9 A). These results strongly indicate that thebphA1A2(orf3)A3A4BC and the bphX0X1X2X3D are independently transcribed. However, no typical transcriptional termination signal was found downstream of bphC. At the present, we could determine six transcriptional initiation sites in the KF707 bph operon by primer extension analyses but failed to obtain information about the promoters except for orf0 and the transcriptional terminator(s) in this study. No typical terminator sequences were found in the operon. To investigate the sizes of mRNA transcripts, we performed Northern blot analyses using the antisense probes of bph genes. However, we failed to detect the clear transcript signals because they were smeared (data not shown). A number of studies in the past revealed that many of the gene clusters involved in the degradations of aromatic compounds including biphenyl are present on movable elements such as plasmids and transposons. Such elements permit microorganisms to degrade aromatic compounds by horizontal gene transfer. It was reported that the bph gene cluster involved in the metabolism of biphenyl/4-chlorobiphenyl is located in the 55-kb transposon Tn4371 (17Merlin C. Springael D. Mergeay M. Toussaint A. Mol. Gen.

Mergeay M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1674-1681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent study also revealed that the 90-kb bph-sal element coding for biphenyl and salicylate metabolism behaves like a conjugative transposon in Pseudomonas putida KF715 whosebph gene cluster is nearly identical to that of KF707 except that the bphX0X1X2X3 genes were deleted (35Nishi A. Tominaga K. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1949-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). If this is the case in KF707, the bph genes could be foreign genes derived from other strains. Such genes might be regulated and expressed in different fashions because the sigma factor(s) in KF707 may recognize certain regions as promoters. This could be the reason why so many transcriptional initiation sites were detected in the KF707bph gene clusters."

A topological reporter construct, encoding an internal 53-amino acid peptide of invertase (Suc2p) containing three Asp-X-Ser/Thr glycosylation sites, was inserted in-frame into the hydrophilic NH2- and COOH-terminal domains and each of the 11 hydrophilic loops that separate the 12 hydrophobic segments of Gap1p. The resulting 13 gene sandwich fusion proteins were expressed in a gap1Δ null mutant strain; 9 of these retain amino acid transport activity and are folded and correctly targeted to the plasma membrane. The glycosylation state of each of the fusion proteins was monitored; the results indicate that all 12 hydrophobic segments of Gap1p span the membrane, and the NH2 and COOH termini are cytoplasmically oriented. These results were independently tested by isolating sealed right-side-out microsomes from sec12–1 strains expressing six different Gap1p constructs containing functional factor Xa protease cleavage sites. The pattern of factor Xa protease cleavage was found to be consistent with the presence of 12 membrane-spanning domains. Gap1p exhibited the same membrane topology in strains lacking Shr3p; therefore, Gap1p fully integrates into the ER membrane independently of this permease-specific packaging chaperone."
https://openalex.org/W2169316975,"Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins (G proteins) are involved in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling of vesicles in yeast and mammalian secretory cells. However, little is known about their contribution to fast synaptic transmission. We loaded guanine nucleotide analogs directly into a giant nerve terminal in rat brainstem slices. Inhibition of G-protein activity had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, but augmented synaptic depression and significantly slowed recovery from depression. A nonhydrolyzable GTP analog blocked recovery of transmission from activity-dependent depression. Neither effect was accompanied by a change in presynaptic calcium currents. Thus, G proteins contribute to fast synaptic transmission by refilling synaptic vesicles depleted after massive exocytosis."

The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor involved in these processes has not been identified. To monitor the activation state of Rho kinase, we developed a vimentin head/Rho kinase chimera, which is intramolecularly phosphorylated in a Rho-dependent manner at Ser71 of the fused vimentin head. Using this system, we identified a clone termed KIAA0380, which contains the Gα12/13-binding domain as well as a tandem of the Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology (DH/PH) domain, as an activator of Rho/Rho kinase signaling. Molecular dissection analyses revealed that a proline-rich motif C-terminally adjacent to DH/PH domain is essential for plasma membrane localization of KIAA0380 and cortical actin reorganization followed by cell rounding. In contrast, the DH/PH domain of KIAA0380 is localized in the cytoplasm, where it activates Rho/Rho kinase and induces stress fiber formation, consistent with results using p115 Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which has a similar structure to KIAA0380 but lacks a proline-rich motif. These results suggest that upon stimulation, KIAA0380 translocates to the plasma membrane via the proline-rich motif and there activates Rho/Rho kinase signaling.

In fibroblasts, Rho controls the assembly of actin stress fibers and associated focal adhesion complexes, while Rac and Cdc42 control the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia respectively (1Ridley A.J.

In addition to these effects, the three GTPases have been reported to trigger a number of additional cellular activities (1Ridley A.J. Hall A.

For example, Rho is required for G1 cell cycle progression, activates the serum response transcription factor, and plays a role in the cell cycle during cytokinesis. Cytoskeletal changes mediated by Rho vary between cell types. In neuronal cell lines, Rho induces the formation of a cortical shell of F-action that mediates cytoskeletal contraction (5Kranenburg O. Poland M. Gebbink M. Oomen L. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2417-2427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is thought to underlie growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and rounding cell body in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)1 (5Kranenburg O.

Like other small GTPases, Rho is thought to act as a molecular switch to control intracellular signal transduction pathways; it exists in either an inactive (GDP-bound) or an active (GTP-bound) conformation, and regulatory proteins that control this GDP/GTP cycle include over 15 distinct guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), around 10 GTPase-activating proteins and at least two guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (11Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 12Lamarche N. Hall A.

Many GEFs for Rho family proteins were discovered by virtue of their ability to transform NIH3T3 cells when overexpressed or when activated by truncation. All these proteins share a 250-amino acid stretch of significant sequence similarity with Dbl, termed Dbl homology (DH) domain, adjacent to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (11Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The DH domain was shown to be responsible for nucleotide exchange activity toward Rho family GTPases (14Hart M.J.

In addition to MLC and myosin-binding subunit, Rho kinase phosphorylates the ERM family proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin) and adducin both in vitro and in vivo(20Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S.

Despite the physiological importance of Rho kinase, direct detection of the in vivo activation state of Rho kinase has not been feasible. We designed a novel in vivo detection system for the state of Rho kinase activation and used this system to identify the novel activator for Rho/Rho kinase signaling, KIAA0380, which was originally isolated from a human brain cDNA library in a random cloning project (31Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). After confirming that KIAA0380 actually functions as a Rho-specific GEF in vitro and in vivo, cell biological characterization of KIAA0380 was done. KIAA0380 induced actin reorganization followed by cell rounding in various types of cells, and induced neurite retraction and cell rounding in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells. Since KIAA0380 is composed of various functional domains that are commonly found in signaling molecules, we prepared several mutants and analyzed the physiological significance of the functional domains. Interestingly, in addition to DH/PH domain, a proline-rich motif that is C-terminally adjacent to the DH/PH domain is also essential for plasma membrane location of KIAA0380, cortical actin reorganization, and cell rounding. Our data suggest that the proline-rich motif of KIAA0380 is involved in localization to the cell membrane and to the biological activity of KIAA0380. In Neuro2a cells, the N terminus fragment of KIAA0380 inhibited LPA-mediated neurite retraction. Immunological analysis revealed that KIAA0380 is well expressed in Neuro2a cells, but another Gα12/13-binding p115 RhoGEF, which is also termed Lsc (32Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), was not detected. Taken together, these findings suggest that, in neuronal cells, KIAA0380 functions as a RhoGEF at the cell periphery and regulates G12/13-coupled receptor-mediated Rho activation, an event essential for neurite retraction and growth cone collapse.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), were obtained by fusing with the intermediate filament protein vimentin head domain (aa 2–87) with respective Rho kinase cDNAs and constructed into pRK5 vector containing Myc tag. The cDNA fragments of KIAA0380-FL (aa 1–1522), -ΔDH (Δaa 735–958), -DH/PH-C (aa 1485–1522), -DH/PH-Pro (aa 735–1119), -RGS-DH/PH(aa 301–1080), -DH/PH (aa 735–1080), -DH (aa 735–958), -N (aa 1–592), and -C (aa 1056–1522) were subcloned into pRK5-Myc vector. For site-directed mutagenesis, QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene) were used. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. GTPases, KIAA0380-RGS-DH/PH and KIAA0380-C were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The recombinant proteins were released from the beads by cleavage with human thrombin. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and purity of the protein preparations was confirmed on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. KIAA0380-C fragment expressed in E. coli was used as an antigen. A rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for KIAA0380-C fragment was produced and characterization was carried out as described elsewhere (34Inada H. Togashi H. Nakamura Y. Kaibuchi K. Nagata K.

Western blot analysis was done and the immunoreactive bands were visualized by making use of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Swiss 3T3, COS7, and Neuro2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDCKII cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. COS7 and Neuro2a cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, transfected COS7 cells were serum-starved for 16 h and then harvested. Transfected Neuro2a cells on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips were maintained in a serum-starved condition for 24 h and then harvested. Swiss 3T3 and MDCKII cell nuclei were microinjected with pRK5-Myc vectors containing wild type or mutants of KIAA0380 and p115RhoGEF, as described (35Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then were subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Exceptionally, fixation was done using 10% trichloroacetic acid to detect RhoA. After primary antibody incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the cells were incubated with a combination of the secondary antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) to detect F-actin. To detect the transfected proteins, 9E10 (a mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibody) and FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG were used. For detection of KIAA0380, affinity-purified anti-KIAA0380 antibody was used as the primary antibody, and Alexa 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) as the secondary one. Anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz), anti-tubulin (Sigma), and anti-vimentin mouse monoclonal antibodies were used as primary antibodies to detect RhoA, tubulin, and vimentin, respectively. Cells were analyzed using a confocal microscope (Olympus, LSM-GB200). In vitro GDP/GTP exchange activity of recombinant Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 (10 pmol) was measured as described (36Nagata K. Nozawa Y. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 88: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), in the presence or absence of recombinant GST-KIAA0380-RGS-DH/PH fragment (20 pmol). Analysis of guanine nucleotides bound to Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 was made, as described (37Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5993-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Rho, Rac or Cdc42, with or without Myc-KIAA0380, were labeled with [32P]Pi at 0.1 mCi/ml for 4 h and then the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. FLAG-tagged GTPases were then immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody. After denaturation of the proteins, eluted nucleotides were analyzed by polyethyleneimine thin layer chromatography. Guanine nucleotides were detected and quantitated using the BAS 2500 system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Neuro2a and COS7 cells transiently expressing KIAA0380 or p115 RhoGEF were harvested with of RIPA buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmNaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and 50 μl of lysate (50–90 μg of protein) was used for each assay. KIAA0380 and p115 RhoGEF were immunoprecipitated, using specific antibodies. After washing the precipitates three times with RIPA buffer, the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Western blotting was done using anti-KIAA0380 and anti-p115 RhoGEF antibodies. The head domain of vimentin is phosphorylated specifically at Ser71 by Rho kinase, and the phosphorylation state of vimentin can be detected using a site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody, TM71 (38Goto H.

Shibata M. Ando S. Saga S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3074-3079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such being the case, Ser71 is useful for monitoring the vimentin head phosphorylation state in vivo by Rho kinase. Based on this characteristic feature, we attempted to establish a chimera construct in which the vimentin head domain (aa 2–87) is fused to the N terminus of Rho kinase (Fig. 1 A). Since Rho activates the Rho kinase pathway in vitro and in vivo, we first asked whether Rho could activate VH-Rho kinase and phosphorylate the attached vimentin head domain at Ser71. pRK5-Myc-VH-Rho kinase was co-transfected into COS7 cells using various Rho, Rac and Cdc42 constructs. Phosphorylation of VH-Rho kinase was monitored by Western blotting, using TM71. As shown in Fig.1 B, only the active version of Rho (L63Rho) strongly induced phosphorylation of vimentin-Ser71, whereas an inactive version of Rho (N19Rho) and constitutively active Rac and Cdc42 did not do so. These results indicate that the phosphorylation at Ser71 of vimentin head of VH-Rho kinase is an active Rho-dependent event. As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, there are at least two possible molecular mechanisms for Ser71 phosphorylation; one is intramolecular, and the other is intermolecular. To determine which molecular mechanism underlies the observed Ser71phosphorylation, we analyzed the inactive version of VH-Rho kinase, KDTT. As shown in Fig. 1 C, fetal bovine serum induced Ser71 phosphorylation of wild type VH-Rho kinase but not KDTT. Even when constitutively activated Rho kinase was co-transfected with KDTT, phosphorylation of Ser71 did not occur (Fig.1 C), which strongly suggests that endogenous Rho kinase cannot interact with the vimentin head of VH-Rho kinase. In these experiments, phosphorylation of endogenous vimentin at Ser71 was detected, as shown in Fig. 1 C. Taken together, we considered that the phosphorylation of Ser71of VH-Rho kinase is an intramolecular event. Since ectopically expressed constitutively active Rho kinase localizes diffusely in the cytoplasm and is no longer regulated by RhoGEF/Rho, it can phosphorylate endogenous vimentin (Fig. 1 C). On the other hand, serum stimulation did not induce endogenous vimentin phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C), perhaps because the intracellular localization of activated Rho kinase is restricted by RhoGEF/Rho; thus, the kinase may not interact with and phosphorylate endogenous vimentin. As our newly designed Rho kinase activity detection system proved useful to monitor the activation state of the kinase, this system may be able to detect novel Rho kinase activators. KIAA0380 was first isolated from a human brain cDNA library in a random cloning project (31Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Since this activator contains a tandem of the DH/PH domain and functions as a RhoGEF in vitro (41Rumenapp U. Blomquist A. Schworer G. Schablowski H. Psoma A. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we asked if KIAA0380 functions as an in vivo activator for Rho kinase. As shown in Fig.2 A, KIAA0380 strongly induced phosphorylation of Ser71 of VH-Rho kinase, to an extent similar to that seen with p115 RhoGEF. In contrast, the deletion mutant lacking the DH domain (KIAA0380ΔDH) did not phosphorylate Ser71. KIAA0380 most likely activates Rho kinase through the direct activation of Rho. Since KIAA0380 activates VH-Rho kinase in vivo and consequently induces autophosphorylation of the kinase at Ser71, KIAA0380 may directly activate Rho. To determine if the KIAA0380-induced Ser71 phosphorylation occurs through activation of Rho signaling by KIAA0380 and not through Rho-independent events, we wanted to determine if KIAA0380 would directly activate Rho both in vitro and in vivo. As for in vitro experiments, recombinant Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 were first complexed with nonradioactive GDP and then incubated with [35S]GTPγS in the presence or absence of GST-fused KIAA0380-RGS-DH/PH. As shown in Fig. 2 B, KIAA0380-RGS-DH/PH accelerated the binding of GTPγS to Rho but not to Rac or to Cdc42, findings consistent with reported data (41Rumenapp U. Blomquist A. Schworer G. Schablowski H. Psoma A. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since some Dbl family proteins show different substrate specificitiesin vitro and in vivo (42Olson M.F. Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1628-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 43Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine if KIAA0380 would activate Rho in vivo. The pRK5-Flag vector harboring Rho, Rac, or Cdc42 was introduced into COS7 cells. When Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 were expressed by themselves, the bound GTP accounted for 16.4%, 5.8%, and 5.9%, respectively. We then examined the effects of KIAA0380 regarding activation of these GTPase. As shown in Fig. 2 C, coexpression of KIAA0380 but not Rac and Cdc42, led to a increase in the GTP-bound form of Rho, up to 34.4%. These results of in vivo experiments indicate that KIAA0380 is a physiological Rho-specific GEF and also confirm reliability of our system for detecting Rho kinase activity. RhoGEFs are important regulators of Rho-dependent actin polymerization. To confirm the involvement of KIAA0380 in actin reorganization, we microinjected pRK5-Myc-KIAA0380 into Swiss 3T3 cells and 3 h later, KIAA0380-expressing cells were identified by staining the Myc epitope. F-actin organization was examined after staining with phalloidin. Cells expressing KIAA0380 showed a marked cell rounding and actin staining was strong underneath plasma membranes of the round cell bodies (Fig.3, A–C). On the other hand, p115 RhoGEF, a Rho-specific GEF structurally and highly homologous to KIAA0380, did not induce cortical actin reorganization followed by cell rounding but did induce stress fibers (Fig. 3, D–F). In addition to a tandem of DH and PH domains, KIAA0380 exhibits characteristic structural features such as the PDZ domain involved in protein-protein interaction and the RGS motif interacting with α subunits of G12 and G13 (31Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 44Fukuhara S. Murga C. Zohar M. Igishi T. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5868-5879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological significance of each structural domain, we prepared a variety of truncation and deletion mutants of KIAA0380, as shown in Fig. 4 A, and transiently expressed them in Swiss 3T3 cells. As depicted in Fig.4 B, the results show that the DH domain and also the PH domain are essential for actin reorganization since the DH domain alone does not induce reorganization. Moreover, it is notable that the DH/PH domains per se do not induce full contraction of cells; a proline-rich motif (aa 1081–1119) adjacent to the PH domain is required for KIAA0380-induced cell rounding. The contraction of polymerized F-actin appeared to be strong, and the fully rounded phenotype was observed even in MDCKII cells, which have tight cell-cell attachments (Fig. 5, A–F). Since KIAA0380 is predominantly expressed in the brain, and cortical actin reorganization followed by cell rounding is a characteristic feature of neuronal cells in which Rho-Rho kinase signaling is activated, we next examined the effects of KIAA0380 on the morphology of Neuro2a cells. We transiently overexpressed KIAA0380 or L63Rho in Neuro2a cells and examined morphology of the cells expressing the respective proteins. After transfection, the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 16 h. Transfected cells were identified by staining the Myc epitope, and F-actin organization was examined. In serum-free medium, nontransfected cells had flattened cell bodies and extended neurites (Fig. 5, G–I), while cells expressing KIAA0380 showed marked cell rounding and extended neurites were never apparent. In this transfectant, strong actin staining was evident in the rounded cell bodies. These results clearly indicate that activation of Rho signaling by KIAA0380 is sufficient to form cortical shells of F-actin that mediate cytoskeletal contraction and cell rounding. As KIAA0380 is highly expressed in the brain, it may play a role in neuronal cellular processes regulated by Rho. To elucidate related"

Extensive genetic and biochemical studies inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassahave identified components of these complexes. The S. cerevisiae TOM complex is composed of at least nine proteins, Tom71, Tom70, Tom40, Tom37, Tom22, Tom20, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5. Tom70, Tom37, Tom22, and Tom20 function as import receptors. Tom71 has strong similarity to Tom70 and is weakly associated with the TOM complex (9Ramage L. Junne T. Harne K. Lithgow T. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), although its function is unclear. Tom40 is deeply embedded in the outer membrane in a predicted β-barrel structure and functions as the central component of the translocation channel (10Vestweber W. Brunner J. Baker A. Schatz G.

Thus, Tom40, Tom22, and three smaller Tom proteins form the general preprotein import pore (the TOM core complex) of ∼400 kDa (14Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W.

A recent study revealed that Tom22 not only functions as the import receptor, but also regulates the TOM complex organization (19von Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J.

The mitochondrial inner membrane has at least two separate import machineries. The Tim23-Tim17 system mediates, in conjunction with Tim44 and mHsp70 in the matrix, mitochondrial transport of matrix-targeted preproteins (8Voos W. Martin H. Krimmer T. Pfanner N. Biochim. Biophys.

The Tim54-Tim22-Tim18 system acts with the small Tim proteins in the intermembrane space to mediate insertion of the metabolite carrier proteins, such as the ADP/ATP carrier, as well as several TIM components, such as Tim23, Tim22, and Tim17, into the inner membrane (21Koehler C.M.

Human TOM34 was cloned using a degenerate tetratricopeptide repeat sequence present in Tom70 and Tom20 (35Nuttall S.D. Hanson B.J. Mori M. Hoogenraad N.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Metaxin has a 25% sequence identity to yeast Tom37 in the N-terminal region, although whether it is a mammalian counterpart of Tom37 is not yet known (36Armstrong L.C. Komiya T. Bergman B.E. Mihara K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6510-6518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TOM34 and metaxin might function as the import receptor. Furthermore, we have recently identified and characterized the rat homologue of Tom40 2H. Suzuki, Y. Okazawa, T. Komiya, S. Kitada, A. Ito, and K. Mihara, manuscript in preparation.2H. Suzuki, Y.

Mihara, unpublished observations.This study reports the identification and characterization of a mammalian homologue of Tom22. This protein was found serendipitously during the study of the diphtheria toxin receptor complex using monoclonal antibodies prepared against the membrane fraction of Vero cells as antigens (37Mekada E. Okada Y. Uchida T. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Iwamoto R. Senoh H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20463-20464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that one of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the ∼22-kDa mitochondrial outer membrane protein 1C9-2. The cDNA was cloned based on the partial amino acid sequence of the purified protein. Its primary sequence was 19–20% identical to that of fungal Tom22, the multifunctional regulator of the protein translocase complex of the mitochondrial outer membrane (the TOM complex). Despite this low sequence identity, 1C9-2 and fungal Tom22 shared characteristic structural similarities in the hydropathy profile, the membrane topology, and the distribution of acidic amino acid clusters in the extramembrane domains. Furthermore, 1C9-2 is a component of the mammalian TOM complex containing TOM40 and several components of smaller molecular size, and the anti-1C9-2 antibody inhibited mitochondrial protein import. Most notably, it complemented the functional defect in Δtom22 yeast cells. We conclude that 1C9-2 is the functional homologue of Tom22.DISCUSSIONWe have identified an ∼22-kDa human mitochondrial outer membrane protein (1C9-2) as a component of the TOM complex. The amino acid sequence of 1C9-2 has an overall identity of 19% to S. cerevisiae Tom22. Despite the low identity of the primary sequence, they have several structural similarities: transmembrane orientation, hydropathy profile, and distribution of highly acidic amino acid regions in the N-terminal segment. Consistent with these features, 1C9-2 complemented the defects of both growth and protein import in Δtom22 yeast cells. We thus conclude that 1C9-2 is the functional homologue of Tom22. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of mammalian TOM22 as a subunit of the TOM complex, and we refer to this protein as human TOM22. We also cloned rat TOM22 cDNA, which codes for a 142-amino acid protein with a sequence identity of 93.6% to human TOM22. Blue native PAGE of the digitonin-solubilized outer membrane of rat liver mitochondria revealed that rat TOM22 is firmly associated with rat TOM40 and forms the ∼400-kDa TOM complex. In addition to these components, several components ∼5–10 kDa in molecular size, OM10, OM7.5, and OM5, have been detected in the rat TOM complex.2 The TOM complex purified from potato mitochondria is ∼230 kDa in size and has unique subunit compositions: Tom40, Tom20, Tom7, and four other components of smaller molecular size, but the counterpart of Tom22 was absent (47Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17251-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mammalian TOM complex resembles the fungal TOM complex in size and composition, although the smaller molecular size components remain to be characterized.The surface-exposed cis-site and the intermembrane space-exposed trans-site act in series to drive the translocation of preproteins across the outer membrane (48Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tom20 and Tom22 provide the cis-site, and preproteins bind to this site through weak electrostatic interactions (48Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 49Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R.

The intermembrane space-exposed segment of Tom40 and the C-terminal tail of Tom22 might contribute to the trans-site (51Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T.

Highly acidic segments are frequently observed in many components of the mitochondrial import system, and it has been speculated that a preprotein with a basic N-terminal mitochondrion-targeting signal is transported across the outer membrane by sequential binding to a relay of acidic receptor sites (the acid chain hypothesis) (54Hönlinger A.

In fact, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Tom22 is conserved among species carrying highly abundant acidic amino acid residues: the contents of acidic residues in this region are 22.6, 25.2, and 25.6% for N. crassa, S. cerevisiae, and humans, respectively. The conserved highly acidic region might participate as thecis-binding site in the recognition and transfer of the basic N-terminal mitochondrion-targeting signal of the preprotein (54Hönlinger A.

The intermembrane space-exposed C-terminal tail of fungal Tom22 is rich in acidic amino acid residues: the contents of acidic residues are 18.4% (net charge, −5) and 21.2% (net charge, −5) for N. crassaand S. cerevisiae, respectively. The significance of the acidic amino acid residues in this region in protein translocation, however, remains controversial (43Nakai M. Kinoshita K. Endo T. J. Biol.

In contrast, the C-terminal tail of mammalian TOM22 does not carry net negative charges: the acidic amino acid content is 7.31% (net charge, 0). It should be noted, in this relation, that the C-terminal tail of C. elegans TOM22 carries a net positive charge. Thus, the importance of the C-terminal tail of Tom22 in preprotein import into mitochondria should be further examined. More extensive studies using the purified domain or liposome-reconstituted vesicles with defined TOM components are required.In summary, we have identified TOM22 in organisms other than S. cerevisiae and N. crassa. These results, in conjunction with the fact that several mammalian homologues (TOM20, TOM40, and several TIM proteins) have been identified, indicate that the mitochondrial import machineries of the outer and inner membranes are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotic organisms. Subtle variations do exist, however, among different species. Future work is required to clarify the functional significance of these differences among species. Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear genome and are synthesized in the cytosol as preproteins. They are guided to the mitochondrial surface by cytoplasmic chaperones (1Mihara K. Omura T. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 104-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and are then transported to the intramitochondrial compartments by the preprotein import machinery of the outer and inner membranes: the TOM1 and TIM complexes, respectively (2Schatz G.

Extensive genetic and biochemical studies inSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassahave identified components of these complexes. The S. cerevisiae TOM complex is composed of at least nine proteins, Tom71, Tom70, Tom40, Tom37, Tom22, Tom20, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5. Tom70, Tom37, Tom22, and Tom20 function as import receptors. Tom71 has strong similarity to Tom70 and is weakly associated with the TOM complex (9Ramage L. Junne T. Harne K. Lithgow T. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), although its function is unclear. Tom40 is deeply embedded in the outer membrane in a predicted β-barrel structure and functions as the central component of the translocation channel (10Vestweber W. Brunner J. Baker A. Schatz G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Tom6 and Tom7 modulate the dynamics of the TOM channel (15Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Tom5 is tightly associated with Tom40 and represents the connecting link between import receptors and the translocation channel (17Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner N. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, Tom40, Tom22, and three smaller Tom proteins form the general preprotein import pore (the TOM core complex) of ∼400 kDa (14Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that Tom22 not only functions as the import receptor, but also regulates the TOM complex organization (19von Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J. Dekker P.J.T. Moczko M. Wagner R. Meijer M. Guiard B. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Nature. 1999; 401: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial inner membrane has at least two separate import machineries. The Tim23-Tim17 system mediates, in conjunction with Tim44 and mHsp70 in the matrix, mitochondrial transport of matrix-targeted preproteins (8Voos W. Martin H. Krimmer T. Pfanner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Rassow J. Dekker P.J.T. von Wilpe S. Meijer M. Soll J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The Tim54-Tim22-Tim18 system acts with the small Tim proteins in the intermembrane space to mediate insertion of the metabolite carrier proteins, such as the ADP/ATP carrier, as well as several TIM components, such as Tim23, Tim22, and Tim17, into the inner membrane (21Koehler C.M.

Despite extensive knowledge of fungal systems, relatively little is known about the import machinery of mammalian mitochondria. Several mammalian counterparts have been identified (for review, see Ref. 28Mori M. Terada K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1403: 12-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): TOM20 (29Goping I.S. Millar D.G. Shore G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 30Seki N.

( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 722-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); and DDP1, a homologue of Tim8 (34Koehler C.M. Leuenberger D. Merchant S. Renold A. Junne T. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2141-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In addition, TOM34 and metaxin have been identified as unique components of the mammalian mitochondrial import system. Human TOM34 was cloned using a degenerate tetratricopeptide repeat sequence present in Tom70 and Tom20 (35Nuttall S.D. Hanson B.J. Mori M. Hoogenraad N.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Metaxin has a 25% sequence identity to yeast Tom37 in the N-terminal region, although whether it is a mammalian counterpart of Tom37 is not yet known (36Armstrong L.C. Komiya T. Bergman B.E. Mihara K. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6510-6518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TOM34 and metaxin might function as the import receptor. Furthermore, we have recently identified and characterized the rat homologue of Tom40 2H. Suzuki, Y. Okazawa, T. Komiya, S. Kitada, A. Ito, and K. Mihara, manuscript in preparation.2H. Suzuki, Y. Okazawa, T. Komiya, S. Kitada, A. Ito, and K. Mihara, manuscript in preparation. and rat TOM70. 3H. Suzuki and K. Mihara, unpublished observations.3H. Suzuki and K. Mihara, unpublished observations. This study reports the identification and characterization of a mammalian homologue of Tom22. This protein was found serendipitously during the study of the diphtheria toxin receptor complex using monoclonal antibodies prepared against the membrane fraction of Vero cells as antigens (37Mekada E. Okada Y. Uchida T. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 38Iwamoto R. Senoh H. Okada Y. Uchida T. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20463-20464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that one of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the ∼22-kDa mitochondrial outer membrane protein 1C9-2. The cDNA was cloned based on the partial amino acid sequence of the purified protein. Its primary sequence was 19–20% identical to that of fungal Tom22, the multifunctional regulator of the protein translocase complex of the mitochondrial outer membrane (the TOM complex). Despite this low sequence identity, 1C9-2 and fungal Tom22 shared characteristic structural similarities in the hydropathy profile, the membrane topology, and the distribution of acidic amino acid clusters in the extramembrane domains. Furthermore, 1C9-2 is a component of the mammalian TOM complex containing TOM40 and several components of smaller molecular size, and the anti-1C9-2 antibody inhibited mitochondrial protein import. Most notably, it complemented the functional defect in Δtom22 yeast cells. We conclude that 1C9-2 is the functional homologue of Tom22. DISCUSSIONWe have identified an ∼22-kDa human mitochondrial outer membrane protein (1C9-2) as a component of the TOM complex. The amino acid sequence of 1C9-2 has an overall identity of 19% to S. cerevisiae Tom22. Despite the low identity of the primary sequence, they have several structural similarities: transmembrane orientation, hydropathy profile, and distribution of highly acidic amino acid regions in the N-terminal segment. Consistent with these features, 1C9-2 complemented the defects of both growth and protein import in Δtom22 yeast cells. We thus conclude that 1C9-2 is the functional homologue of Tom22. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification of mammalian TOM22 as a subunit of the TOM complex, and we refer to this protein as human TOM22. We also cloned rat TOM22 cDNA, which codes for a 142-amino acid protein with a sequence identity of 93.6% to human TOM22. Blue native PAGE of the digitonin-solubilized outer membrane of rat liver mitochondria revealed that rat TOM22 is firmly associated with rat TOM40 and forms the ∼400-kDa TOM complex. In addition to these components, several components ∼5–10 kDa in molecular size, OM10, OM7.5, and OM5, have been detected in the rat TOM complex.2 The TOM complex purified from potato mitochondria is ∼230 kDa in size and has unique subunit compositions: Tom40, Tom20, Tom7, and four other components of smaller molecular size, but the counterpart of Tom22 was absent (47Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17251-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mammalian TOM complex resembles the fungal TOM complex in size and composition, although the smaller molecular size components remain to be characterized.The surface-exposed cis-site and the intermembrane space-exposed trans-site act in series to drive the translocation of preproteins across the outer membrane (48Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tom20 and Tom22 provide the cis-site, and preproteins bind to this site through weak electrostatic interactions (48Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 49Mayer A. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R.

A. 1994; 91: 11973-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The intermembrane space-exposed segment of Tom40 and the C-terminal tail of Tom22 might contribute to the trans-site (51Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Highly acidic segments are frequently observed in many components of the mitochondrial import system, and it has been speculated that a preprotein with a basic N-terminal mitochondrion-targeting signal is transported across the outer membrane by sequential binding to a relay of acidic receptor sites (the acid chain hypothesis) (54Hönlinger A.

In fact, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Tom22 is conserved among species carrying highly abundant acidic amino acid residues: the contents of acidic residues in this region are 22.6, 25.2, and 25.6% for N. crassa, S. cerevisiae, and humans, respectively. The conserved highly acidic region might participate as thecis-binding site in the recognition and transfer of the basic N-terminal mitochondrion-targeting signal of the preprotein (54Hönlinger A.

In contrast, the C-terminal tail of mammalian TOM22 does not carry net negative charges: the acidic amino acid content is 7.31% (net charge, 0). It should be noted, in this relation, that the C-terminal tail of C. elegans TOM22 carries a net positive charge. Thus, the importance of the C-terminal tail of Tom22 in preprotein import into mitochondria should be further examined. More extensive studies using the purified domain or liposome-reconstituted vesicles with defined TOM components are required. In summary, we have identified TOM22 in organisms other than S. cerevisiae and N. crassa. These results, in conjunction with the fact that several mammalian homologues (TOM20, TOM40, and several TIM proteins) have been identified, indicate that the mitochondrial import machineries of the outer and inner membranes are evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotic organisms. Subtle variations do exist, however, among different species. Future work is required to clarify the functional significance of these differences among species. We thank C.

A very low reduction potential (less than −1 V) is required for the first electron transfer to the aromatic ring. In this work the nature of the redox centers of purified benzoyl-CoA reductase from Thauera aromatica was studied by EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results obtained indicated the presence of three [4Fe-4S] clusters. Redox titration studies revealed that the reduction potentials of all three clusters were below −500 mV. The previously reported S = 7/2 state of the enzyme during benzoyl-CoA-independent ATPase activity (Boll, M., Albracht, S. J. P., and Fuchs, G. (1997) Eur. J.

However, in recent years an increasing number of anaerobic bacteria, which are able to oxidize various mononuclear aromatic compounds completely as their sole source for energy and cell carbon, have been discovered. The strategy of these bacteria is the conversion of the multitude of aromatic compounds to only a few key intermediates that become de-aromatized in a reductive enzymatic process (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Heider J.

Rev. 1999; 22: 439-458Crossref Google Scholar).Most of the known pathways lead to benzoyl-CoA that represents the substrate for the de-aromatizing enzyme benzoyl-CoA reductase (BCR).1 The biochemistry of this enzyme has only been studied in the denitrifying bacteriumThauera aromatica (3Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It catalyzes the two-electron reduction of benzoyl-CoA to cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA (Fig.1). This two-electron transfer from reduced ferredoxin to the aromatic ring is stoichiometrically coupled to the hydrolysis of two molecules of MgATP to MgADP (3Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A radical mechanism, corresponding to the Birch reduction, of alternate one-electron and one-proton transfer steps to the aromatic has been proposed for the BCR reaction (5Buckel W. Keese R. Angew.

The flavin is assumed to bind unspecifically to the two ATP-binding sites of BCR. In a previous study the metal centers of BCR were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (8Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the dithionite-reduced state, EPR signals of two interacting [4Fe-4S]+1 centers were detected; additional EPR signals could not clearly be assigned but were characteristic for [2Fe-2S]+1 clusters. BCR also hydrolyzes MgATP in the absence of a reducible substrate (3Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This uncoupled ATPase activity was only observed in the dithionite-reduced and not in the thionine-oxidized state of the enzyme (8Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Novel EPR signals were induced only in the steady state of this ATPase activity and were assigned to an S = 7/2 high spin system. In parallel, a shift from interacting to non-interacting [4Fe-4S]+1clusters was detected. These observations allowed the presentation of a first model for the catalytic cycle of the BCR reaction. This model included an ATP-driven electron activation as a result of conformational changes affecting a reduced, EPR-active iron-sulfur cluster (8Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).In this work we investigated the EPR properties of BCR in more detail. These studies included temperature- and redox potential-dependent studies. In addition we studied the effects of oxygen, AdoPP[NH]P, and acetylene on the EPR properties of BCR. We also investigated57Fe-enriched BCR by Mössbauer spectroscopy in the reduced and oxidized state in the absence and presence of the individual substrates. The results obtained clarified the nature of the redox centers of BCR that we identified as three [4Fe-4S] clusters. The ATP-dependent switch from the S = 1/2 to the S = 7/2 state was confirmed by Mössbauer spectroscopy and could clearly be assigned to a [4Fe-4S] cluster.RESULTSNature of the Iron-Sulfur CentersThe nature of the iron-sulfur centers of BCR was studied by Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopy. Metal analysis of BCR revealed the presence of 10–12 mol of iron/mol of enzyme and substoichiometric amounts of zinc. Earlier EPR studies (7Mittelberger T. Master thesis. University of Freiburg, Germany1996Google Scholar) had indicated the presence of two [4Fe-4S] and additional Fe-S clusters that were assigned to [2Fe-2S] clusters or to a novel metal cluster with an unknown structure. In addition, as part of this work, similar EPR signals typical of [3Fe-4S] clusters were detected in partially inactivated BCR preparations (data not shown).Mössbauer Spectroscopy, Oxidized BCRFor Mössbauer spectroscopy studies, BCR was purified from extracts ofT. aromatica grown anaerobically with 57Fe as sole source of iron. High 57Fe enrichment was achieved as estimated from the resonance absorption effect of about 9% for each subspectrum of the oxidized sample, which corresponds to about 11 mm57Fe (sample concentration was about 1 mm and isolated benzoyl-CoA reductase samples were shown to contain 10–12 mol Fe/mol enzyme). The Mössbauer spectrum of thionine-oxidized BCR taken at 4.2 K in a small external field of 20 mT perpendicular to the γ-beam shows a slightly asymmetric quadrupole doublet (Fig. 2 A). For reasons that will be discussed later, the spectrum was analyzed using three subspectra of equal area. The isomer shifts and quadrupole splittings so obtained (δ ∼0.45 mm s−1 and ΔE Q ∼1 mm s−1, see Table I) are typical of delocalized mixed valence iron sites in tetrahedral sulfur coordination and are characteristic of [4Fe-4S]2+clusters (15Middleton P. Dickson D.P.E. Johnson C.E. Rush J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 114-135Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The slightly different quadrupole splittings of the subspectra indicate structural differences between the three [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters which each contain two delocalized mixed valence iron-pairs with spins S12 = 9/2 and S34 = 9/2 with antiparallel coupling yielding a total cluster spin of zero. Indeed, the spectrum recorded in a high external field of 7T parallel to the γ beam (Fig.2 B) shows magnetic splitting only due to the external field and thus reveals the diamagnetic nature of the clusters in the oxidized BCR sample.Table IParameters for the simulations of the samples A–C of Fig. 2, 3, and 8at 4.2 K in external fields of 20 mT ⊥ γ and 7T ∥ γSub-spectraδΔE QηΓStotA/gNμNRelative areamm s −1mm s −1T%Oxidized BCR10.440.870.70.27033.320.451.320.70.27033.330.451.140.40.27033.3Reduced BCR10.430.980.80.30033.320.451.290.70.30033.330.501.300.80.301 /2(−24; −24; −20)16.640.581.600.40.301 /2(+21; +5; +1)16.6Reduced BCR + MgATP10.430.980.80.30033.320.451.290.70.30033.330.501.300.80.301 /2(−24; −24; −20)12.540.581.600.40.301 /2(+21; +5; +1)12.550.391.170.20.37 /2(+7.7; +8.5, +6.8)660.581.550.0.37 /2(−2.4; −8.8; −16.3)2η is the asymmetry parameter; Γ is the full linewidth at half-maximum; A/gNμN is the effective magnetic hyperfine coupling tensor. Open table in a new tab These results allowed us to exclude the presence of [2Fe-2S] and [3Fe-4S] clusters since both types of oxidized clusters ([2Fe-2S]2+ and [3Fe-4S]+) show subspectra with parameters typical for Fe3+S4 (δ ∼0.25 mm s−1; ΔE Q ∼0.7 mm s−1), which are clearly absent in the Mössbauer spectra of thionine-oxidized BCR. Additionally [3Fe-4S]+ clusters would reveal paramagnetic features in a high external field of 7T, whereas the oxidized sample contained clearly only diamagnetic species.Mössbauer Spectroscopy, Reduced BCRThe Mössbauer spectrum of deazaflavin-reduced BCR recorded at 120 (Fig.3 A) and 4.2 K (Fig.3 B) in a small external field of 20 mT ⊥ γ is shown in Fig. 3, A and B. The 4.2 K spectrum shows the presence of a paramagnetic species and a quadrupole doublet, the latter with parameters (δ ∼0.45 mm s−1 and ΔE Q ∼1 mm s−1, see Table I) similar to those observed in the oxidized sample. EPR investigations (see under “EPR Spectroscopy”) showed the presence of S = 1/2 species, and therefore the paramagnetic species were analyzed by using the spin-Hamiltonian approximation for a total cluster spin S = 1/2 (16Abragam A. Pryce M.H.L. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1951; 205: 135-153Google Scholar). As starting parameters for the simulation parameters for [4Fe-4S]1+ published in Ref. 15Middleton P. Dickson D.P.E. Johnson C.E. Rush J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 114-135Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholarwere used. With this procedure 33% of the total area was attributed to a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster with parameters given in Table I. The remaining 66% of the total area could be simulated with two doublets whose parameters are similar to those (see Table I) found for components 1 and 2 in the thionine oxidized sample. The spectrum taken at 4.2 K in an high external field of 7T ∥ γ (Fig. 3 C) was simulated with the same parameter set as the low field data. Subspectra 1 and 2 represent diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+clusters as in thionine oxidized BCR. By elevating the temperature to 120 K (Fig. 3 A) the diamagnetic subspectra exhibit the isomer shifts δ1 = 0.41 mm s−1, δ2 = 0.4 mm s−1 and the quadrupole splittings ΔEQ1 = 1.04 mm s−1, ΔE Q2 = 0.76 mm s−1. The spectrum of [4Fe-4S]1+ can be simulated with one quadrupole doublet with the parameters δ3 = 0.55 mm s−1, ΔE Q3 = 0.95 mm s−1, which are similar to those reported for the reduced ferredoxin from Clostridium pasteurianum (15Middleton P. Dickson D.P.E. Johnson C.E. Rush J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 114-135Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar).EPR SpectroscopyBased on the results obtained from Mössbauer spectroscopy, we re-investigated the [4Fe-4S] clusters of reduced BCR using temperature-dependent and power saturation EPR studies. To achieve a high degree of reduction, the dithionite used in previous studies was replaced by deazaflavin/light as reductant. Our aim was a clear assignment of individual EPR-subspectra to the three [4Fe-4S] clusters of BCR as identified by Mössbauer spectroscopy. For this purpose we first compared the EPR spectra of unlabeled with 57Fe-labeled enzyme. All EPR features clearly broadened in the 57Fe spectrum as a result of unresolved hyperfine interaction of unpaired electrons with the nucleus of 57Fe (I = 1/2), (Fig.4). This confirmed that high57Fe enrichment was achieved and that no other paramagnetic metal than iron dominated the EPR spectra of our sample.Figure 4EPR spectra of deazaflavin/light reduced benzoyl-CoA reductase. —, unlabeled enzyme; - - -,57Fe-labeled enzyme.

Most unusual for [4Fe-4S] clusters, which normally relax rapidly (17Thomson C.L. Johnson C.E. Dickson D.P.E. Cammack R. Hall D.O. Weser U. Rao K.K. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), an EPR signal from a [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster was observed up to 77 K. At 60 K a rhombic EPR spectrum characteristic of a single [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster with g values at 2.017, 1.938, and 1.908 was observed (Fig. 5 A); this cluster is referred to cluster I. A minor EPR signal atg = 2.004 with less than 0.05 spin/mol protein was superimposed on this spectrum and indicated the presence of a radical of unknown nature. At temperatures below 40 K additional features atg = 2.053 and around g = 1.93 intensified indicating the rise of an EPR signal from an additional [4Fe-4S]+1 cluster relaxing significantly faster than cluster I. At temperatures below 25 K all features started to saturate simultaneously at 2 mW (Fig. 5 A). A difference spectrum between the spectra recorded at 20 K/0.2 mW and the spectrum taken at 60 K and 2 mW normalized for temperature and microwave power is presented in Fig. 5 A. The difference spectrum was rather broad and axial and is assigned to cluster II with g values at 2.053, 1.93, and 1.93. The dependence of the EPR signals of both clusters on temperature and microwave power were highly similar resulting in only a weak difference spectrum. The total spin concentration in the dithionite reduced sample was not higher than 0.82 mol/mol enzyme, indicating only a partial reduction of the clusters. This was in agreement with the results obtained from Mössbauer spectroscopy where the highest degree of reduction was 33%. EPR signals from the putative third [4Fe-4S] cluster of BCR, as expected from Mössbauer spectroscopy, could not be detected in the deazaflavin-reduced sample indicating that it was not reducible by this system. The temperature dependence of the total spin concentration between 20 and 77 K fitted well to the observation that cluster II relaxes faster than cluster I (Fig. 5 B). After normalization for temperature, the spin concentration approximately doubled from 0.42 (60 K) to 0.82 (20 K) spins/enzyme. This increase is considered to be mainly a result of the increased intensity of the cluster II EPR signal which is not detectable at temperatures above 40 K.Figure 5Temperature-dependent EPR spectra of deazaflavin/light-reduced benzoyl-CoA reductase. The enzyme (120 μm) was reduced anaerobically with 20 μm deazaflavin in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 min in white light. A, representative spectra recorded from 60 to 15 K. EPR parameters: microwave frequency, 9.415 GHz; modulation amplitude, 1.17 mT; microwave power, 2 mW for 60 to 25 K spectra and 0.2 mW for 20 and 15 K spectra. Note that the dominant features of the EPR spectrum recorded at 60 K are assigned to cluster I in this work. 20 K–60 K is the difference spectrum of the 20 K spectrum minus the 60 K spectrum and is assigned to cluster II. The spectra were normalized for temperature and microwave power. Thenumbers in the figure refer to g values.B, total S = 1/2 spin concentration of the spectra recorded at 15 to 77 K.

These broad features also have been detected in a previous study and were ascribed to two interacting 2[4Fe-4S] clusters (8Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Even at 4 K and 20 mW microwave power these features could not be saturated (8Boll M. Albracht S.J.P. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was concluded that in some protein molecules the clusters interacted magnetically, whereas others showed EPR features of single isolated [4Fe-4S]+1species, indicating a conformational heterogeneity. Since spin integration of the broad signal extending over 200 mT could not be carried out accurately, it was impossible to give an exact ratio of coupling/non-coupling clusters. An additional problem was that all clusters were at best partially reduced, so it was not clear which of the [4Fe-4S] clusters contributed to this broad signal. A rough estimate indicated that the spin concentration of the broad signals at 4 K was in the same range as the total spin concentration detected at 25 K. Therefore, we estimate that photoreduction with deazaflavin resulted in a 50% reduction of all clusters with half of the paramagnetic clusters interacting. This value is slightly higher than that in the samples used for Mössbauer spectroscopy (33%).The results obtained from Mössbauer spectroscopy and the content of iron and acid-labile sulfur (10–12 mol/mol enzyme) strongly indicated the presence of three [4Fe-4S] clusters but only two clusters could be identified clearly by EPR spectroscopy in the deazaflavin-reduced state, although the broad signal of interacting clusters could not be assigned. In order to identify a third [4Fe-4S] cluster by EPR spectroscopy, we studied BCR under steady state conditions of ATP-dependent benzoyl-CoA reduction. In Fig.6 B a representative EPR spectrum of BCR recorded at 40 K is presented showing that clusters I and II are both more oxidized than in the dithionite-reduced sample, as indicated by a 80% decrease of signal intensity at g = 2.05 and g = 1.93 and 1.91. In parallel, novel EPR features were observed in the g = 2 region. After subtraction of the EPR spectrum of dithionite-reduced BCR (× 0.2) from the one obtained in the steady state of substrate reduction, an EPR signal was left with features at g = 2.037, 1.995, 1.97, and 1.96 (Fig. 6, B and C). These features could not be ascribed to an isolated S = 1/2 species but instead are typical of an interaction with a second magnetic site. With this assumption, the EPR signal indicated the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster with g values ∼2.03, 1.995, and 1.965 with splitting constants in the range 2–3 mT. A decrease of the modulation amplitude to 0.3 mT did not resolve the signal further (not shown). Its spin concentration amounted to less than 0.35 spins/enzyme, indicating that cluster III was reduced to approximately the same extent as the other two clusters in the photoreduced sample. Optimal EPR conditions were 30 K and 2 mW. The nature of the second magnet involved in the interaction with cluster III is not known. It is rather unlikely that this is either cluster I or II since the 40 K difference spectrum in Fig.6 D was obtained easily, which would not have been the case had one of these clusters been coupled magnetically with cluster III. A hyperfine interaction with a nuclear spin, such as a proton, is an unlikely explanation since this type of interaction usually results in splitting constants significantly below 2 mT, although this cannot be ruled out absolutely. It is likely that the complex EPR spectrum of cluster III is due to a dipole-dipole interaction with an additional unknown paramagnet, such as a radical species. At temperatures higher than 77 K an isotropic radical signal remains (Fig. 6 A). It is not clear whether the decrease of spin concentration of the radical at lower temperatures was only due to saturation or also to an interaction with cluster III.Figure 6EPR spectra of dithionite-reduced benzoyl-CoA reductase in the presence of MgATP (20 mm) and benzoyl-CoA (3 mm).

Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 946-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Boll M. Fuchs G. Tilley G. Armstrong F. Lowe D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4929-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The reduction potentials of the iron-sulfur clusters of BCR therefore are expected to be below −400 mV. As discussed above, Mössbauer studies indicated that only 1/3 of all clusters could be reduced by dithionite or deazaflavin/light, indicating that the reduction potential of at least two clusters must be far below −500 mV.We have studied the redox potential dependence of the EPR spectra recorded at different temperatures. Our goal was to investigate the redox potential-dependent rise of both the signals of the interacting and the non-interacting clusters. At potentials more positive than −400 mV, only weak EPR signals were detected, originating from adventitious iron at g = 4.3, or in some batches minor signals (spin concentration less than 0.3 mol/mol enzyme) of an oxidized [3Fe-4S]+1 cluster (not shown). This EPR signal is assigned to a partial degradation of [4Fe-4S] to [3Fe-4S] clusters and was similar to the spectra obtained when BCR was exposed to air, leading to an irreversible inactivation of the enzyme (see also Fig. 10). In Fig.7 B samples recorded at 25 K at potentials from −467 to −535 mV are shown. Usually the redox titration was performed in oxidative direction by oxidation of dithionite-reduced enzyme with ferricyanide. At −467 mV the 25 K spectrum displays features of cluster I (see 60 K spectrum in Fig.5 A) as indicated by the ratio of signal amplitudes atg = 1.93–1.908 and the typical rhombicity. When the potential was lowered further, additional features appeared atg = 2.053. In parallel, the shape in the g<2 region changed as a result of an increase of intensity atg = 1.91. These two features were typical for an increase of spin concentration of cluster II which increasingly dominated the spectrum as the potential was poised lower. Due to the strong radical signal of the mediators the spin concentration at −543 mV and 25 K could only be estimated to be in the range of 0.4–0.6 mol/mol enzyme; the spin concentration was lower than in photoreduced sample (0.82 mol/mol).Figure 10EPR spectra of air-inactivated benzoyl-CoA reductase (250 μm).

At −467 mV, when the 25 K spectrum mainly displayed features of cluster I, a very poorly resolved and broad signal aroundg = 2 started to develop. In parallel to reduction of cluster II, the EPR signal of the interacting [4Fe-4S]+clusters also increased, indicating that these signals derive from the magnetic interaction of cluster II with at least one of the other two clusters. However, our results show that this interaction did not involve all reduced cluster II, since at higher temperatures EPR signals typical of non-interacting clusters could be ascribed to isolated clusters I and II. No sign of even a partial reduction of the putative cluster III was observed at potentials down to −543 mV. However, one has to take into account that the EPR signals ascribed to this cluster (g = 2.037, 1.97, and 1.96) are quite narrow and close to those of the strong radical of the redox dyes, so that they could be obscured by the latter. Additionally, cluster III might couple with cluster II resulting in the broad signal observed at low temperatures. It was not possible to determine accurately the spin concentration from the low temperature spectra.Since none of the clusters was even half-reduced, a fit to a Nernst curve was impossible. The spectra shown in Fig. 7 B clearly imply that the reduction potential of cluster I and cluster II must be lower than −500 mV. However due to only a partial reduction a fit to Nernst curve was impossible.Effect"
https://openalex.org/W2057673975,"Acyl carrier protein synthase (AcpS) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of fatty acids in all bacteria. AcpS catalyzes the transfer of 4′-phosphopantetheine from coenzyme A (CoA) to apo-ACP, thus converting apo-ACP to holo-ACP that serves as an acyl carrier for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and lipids. To further understand the physiological role of AcpS, we identified, cloned, and expressed the acpS and acpP genes ofStreptococcus pneumoniae and purified both products to homogeneity. Both acpS and acpP form operons with the genes whose functions are required for other cellular metabolism. The acpS gene complements an Escherichia coli mutant defective in the production of AcpS and appears to be essential for the growth of S. pneumoniae. Gel filtration and cross-linking analyses establish that purified AcpS exists as a homotrimer. AcpS activity was significantly stimulated by apo-ACP at concentrations over 10 μm and slightly inhibited at concentrations of 5–10 μm. Double reciprocal analysis of initial velocities of AcpS at various concentrations of CoA or apo-ACP indicated a random or compulsory ordered bi bi type of reaction mechanism. Further analysis of the inhibition kinetics of the product (3′,5′-ADP) suggested that it is competitive with respect to CoA but mixed (competitive and noncompetitive) with respect to apo-ACP. Finally, apo-ACP bound tightly to AcpS in the absence of CoA, but CoA failed to do so in the absence of apo-ACP. Together, these results suggest that AcpS may be allosterically regulated by apo-ACP and probably proceeds by an ordered reaction mechanism with the first formation of the AcpS-apo-ACP complex and the subsequent transfer of 4′-phosphopantetheine to the apo-ACP of the complex.

In addition, only the AcpS fromE. coli, a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium, has been thoroughly characterized to date. It still remains to be determined whether AcpS from Gram-positive bacteria would play the same physiological role. Finally, AcpS appears to possess all of the features necessary for a good antibacterial target, such as its essential nature, widespread existence in bacteria, and unique catalytic position in a pathway (fatty acid biosynthesis). Thus, AcpS might be a valuable antibacterial target for identifying novel antimicrobial agents. To better understand the function of AcpS inStreptococcus pneumoniae, a sphere-shaped, Gram-positive bacterium and also a major human pathogen of the upper respiratory tract, and to explore AcpS as an antibacterial target, we first cloned and expressed the acpS and acpP genes of S. pneumoniae and characterized both gene products. The results of this study show that S. pneumoniae AcpS shares many biochemical properties with E. coli AcpS but also exhibits major differences with respect to their native structures and substrate regulations. In addition, the results of this study suggest that AcpS proceeds by an ordered reaction mechanism with the first formation of the enzyme-apo-ACP intermediate from apo-ACP followed by the transfer of 4′-phosphopantetheine from CoA to the apo-ACP of the complex. Finally, both acpS and acpP form complex operons with the genes whose functions are not required for fatty acid biosynthesis. Unless specified otherwise, all fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All fast protein liquid chromatography resins and columns used for protein purification and strains and reagents for construction, expression, and purification of GST-fused proteins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Luria Bertani (LB) broth medium was purchased from Bio 101, Inc. (Vista, CA). All polyacrylamide gels and reagents were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA). SYPRO Orange and Bradford protein assay reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad, and ethylene glycolbis(succinimidylsuccinate) (sulfo-EGS) was obtained from Pierce. [3H]CoA (specific activity, 1.5 Ci/mmol) was custom-synthesized by NEN Life Science Products. The acpP andacpS genes were cloned from S. pneumoniae by PCR as described before (27Zhao G. Meier T.I. Peery R.B Matsushima P. Skatrud P.L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of the reagents, plasmids, and cell lines used for cloning and expression were the same as those described before (27Zhao G. Meier T.I. Peery R.B Matsushima P. Skatrud P.L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the initial sequence of acpS, it was thought that the acpS open reading frame started at the second Met codon (see GenBankTM accession numberAF276617). Thus, the primers corresponding to this sequence were designed and used for cloning the S. pneumoniae acpS gene (see below). However, we have recently realized that the open reading frame of the acpS gene probably starts at the first Met codon rather than the second codon (GenBankTMaccession number AF276617). Thus, the acpS gene cloned and expressed might lack the first two codons encoding the amino acid residues of Met-Arg. To clone the acpS gene, the following PCR primers were designed and used to amplify the acpS gene for cloning into E. coli expression systems. The 5′ PCR primer (5′-CGCGGATCCCATATGATAGTTGGACACGGAATTG-3′) was designed at the ATG start codon of acpS and contains BamHI andNdeI sites for cloning purposes. The 3′ PCR primer (5′-CGCGGATCCCTAGCTTTCATGAATTTCCTCC-3′) was designed at the stop codon of acpS and contains a BamHI site after the stop codon. Using these primers, acpS was PCR-amplified from S. pneumoniae for 25 cycles under the conditions as described before (27Zhao G. Meier T.I. Peery R.B Matsushima P. Skatrud P.L. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Five PCR products were combined, and a portion of the pooled PCR products was digested withBamHI. The BamHI-digested PCR fragment was cloned into pCZA342, a low copy number plasmid (28Baltz, R. H., Matsushima, P., Peery, R. B., Hoskins, J., Young, M., Norris, F. H., DeHoff, B. S., Rockey, P., Porter, G., Burgett, S. G., Rosteck, P. R., Skatrud, P. L., and Jaskunas, S. R. (1997) Abstracts of the 37th ICAAC, p. 391(S-46), Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Toronto, Canada.Google Scholar) that had been digested with BamHI and dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. acpS from several pCZA342 clones was sequenced, and a clone containing the consensus acpS gene sequence was used for constructing expression systems. This pCZA342 clone was digested with NdeI and BamHI. TheNdeI–BamHI DNA fragment containingacpS was subcloned into pET-11a (Novagen). The resulting construct was designated as pRBP-19. The pCZA342 clone was also digested with BamHI, and the BamHI fragment ofacpS was subcloned into pGEX-2T, resulting in pRBP-20. To clone the acpP gene, the following PCR primers were used for amplification: the 5′ PCR primer (5′-CGCGGATCCCATATGACAGAAAAAGAAATTTTTGACCGTATTG -3′) and the 3′ PCR primer (5′-CGCGGATCCGAATTCCTATTTTCCTTGAATGATTTTAACCACATC-3′). Using these primers, acpP was PCR-amplified from S. pneumoniae as described above. The PCR products were digested withBamHI. The BamHI-digested PCR fragment was cloned into pCZA342. The pCZA342 clone was digested with NdeI andBamHI. The NdeI–BamHI DNA fragment containing acpP was subcloned into pET-11a (Novagen), resulting in pRBP-16. LY128 (E. coli BL21 (pLysS)/pRBP-19) was first grown at 35 °C overnight in LB broth medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture (40 ml) was then inoculated into 1000 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and grown at 33 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until an A 590 of 0.5–0.6 was reached. The culture was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g at 4 °C for 8 min, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 50 mm citrate phosphate, pH 6.0, and disrupted by passing twice through a French pressure cell. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged at 160,000 × gfor 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was collected and applied to a 15S Source S column (2.5 × 8 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm citrate phosphate, pH 6.0 (buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–1.0 m KCl in buffer A. Fractions (7 ml each) were collected. The presence of AcpS in the fractions was detected by SDS-PAGE analysis (16% Tricine gels) (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The fractions containing AcpS were pooled and applied to a S-100 Sepharose preparative gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography column (5.0 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl. The fractions containing AcpS were collected, adjusted with glycerol to a final concentration of 15% (v/v), and stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). LY135 (E. coli XL1 Blue (mRF′)/pRBP-20) was grown, induced, harvested, disrupted, and centrifuged as above. The supernatant fraction was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (10 ml) that had been equilibrated with 100 ml of PBS. The column was washed with 100 ml of PBS, and the GST-AcpS fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in PBS. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% glycine), and those fractions containing GST-AcpS were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (4 liter), adjusted with glycerol to a final concentration of 15% (v/v), and stored at −70 °C as described above. LY140 (E. coli BL21 (pLysS)/pRBP-16) was grown, induced, harvested, and disrupted as described above. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged as described above. The supernatant fraction was collected and applied to a 15S Source Q column (2.5 × 8 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl (buffer C). The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer C and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.0–1.0 mKCl in buffer C. Fractions (7 ml each) were collected, and the presence of apo-ACP in the fractions was detected by SDS-PAGE as described above (16% tricine gels). The fractions containing apo-ACP were pooled and applied to a S-100 Sepharose gel filtration column (5 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer. Fractions (10 ml each) containing apo-ACP were collected, analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, and stored at −70 °C as described above. To determine the native structure of AcpS, a purified AcpS preparation (375 μg) was applied to a S-75 Superdex gel filtration column (HR 1.0 × 30 cm), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. The column was calibrated with the protein molecular weight standards (Sigma). The effect of detergent or salt on the native structure of AcpS was analyzed by treating AcpS with 6 mm CHAPS or 50–500 mm KCl before and during column chromatography. Sedimentation centrifugation analysis of AcpS was carried out using an XLA ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). A purified AcpS preparation (adjusted to 0.2 and 0.4 mg/ml) was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 24 h at 22 °C. The absorbance at 280 nm as a function of radius after the system reaches equilibrium was analyzed using XL-A/XL-1, a nonlinear le"

Transmission electron microscopy provided direct evidence that EcoRII mediates loop formation of linear DNA containing two EcoRII recognition sites. Specific DNA binding of EcoRII revealed a symmetrical DNase I footprint occupying 16–18 bases. Single amino acid replacement of Val258 by Asn yielded a mutant enzyme that was unaffected in substrate affinity and DNase I footprinting properties, but exhibited a profound decrease in cooperative DNA binding and cleavage activity. Because the electrophoretic mobility of the mutant enzyme-DNA complexes was significantly higher than that of the wild-type, we investigated if mutant V258N binds as a monomer to the substrate DNA. Analysis of the molecular mass of mutant V258N showed a high percentage of protein monomers in solution. The dissociation constant of mutant V258N confirmed a 350-fold decrease of the enzyme dimerization capability. We conclude that Val258is located in a region of EcoRII involved in homodimerization. This is the first report of a specific amino acid replacement in a restriction endonuclease leading to the loss of dimerization and DNA cleavage while retaining specific DNA binding.

The enzymatic activity of these ENases depends on simultaneous binding of two copies of the recognition site (reviewed in Ref. 1Krüger D.H. Kupper D. Meisel A. Reuter M. Schroeder C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Initially observed for EcoRII (2Krüger D.H. Barcak G.J. Reuter M. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3997-4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the need for a second (effector) site was also confirmed for several other ENases (3Oller A.R. Vanden Broek W. Conrad M. Topal M.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2543-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,4Reuter M. Kupper D. Pein C.-D. Petrusyte M. Siksnys V. Frey B. Krüger D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These ENases were named as type IIE. Cooperatively interacting type IIE ENases share characteristic molecular features with transcription regulators, recombinases, and DNA repair enzymes (5Bickle T.A. Krüger D.H Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 434-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experimental results even support the idea of evolutionary relationships to other cellular DNA-binding protein families (6Jo K.

Comprehensive studies have also been performed on two type II enzymes,SfiI and Cfr10I. These enzymes interact simultaneously with two DNA sites like type IIE ENases but differ in the quaternary structure. SfiI and Cfr10I are composed of four identical subunits (8Wentzell L.M.

Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Functional cooperativity can occur between two sites on a single DNA molecule (in cis). This is thought to represent the preferred mode of action. However, depending on the substrate length and concentration, the enzyme can also interact with two sites from different DNA molecules (in trans). One dimeric EcoRII enzyme molecule is sufficient to bind cooperatively two DNA sites (12Petrauskene O.V. Karpova E.A. Gromova E.S. Guschlbauer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol.

Premature dissociation of enzyme-substrate complexes releases partial products (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). EcoRII cleavage activity is inversely correlated to the distance between two sites of a linear DNA molecule (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). No cleavage occurred when the spacing between two sites exceeded a critical length of 1000 bp. Overall, these biochemical studies suggest that EcoRII takes advantage of DNA bending or looping to achieve cooperativity in cis (11Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18623-18630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Petrauskene O.V. Karpova E.A. Gromova E.S. Guschlbauer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Using a membrane-bound EcoRII-derived peptide scan, we recently identified two separate DNA-binding regions I (aa 88–102) and II (aa 256–273) in the primary amino acid sequence of EcoRII (15Reuter M.

We hypothesize that regions I and II participate in forming one of the two equivalent substrate binding sites of EcoRII, because a mutation introduced in DNA-binding region I abolished substrate binding of the complete enzyme dimer (15Reuter M.

Here we answer the question of whether one substrate binding site is formed by an EcoRII monomer or includes contributions of DNA-binding regions from both monomers. The direct observation of EcoRII-induced DNA loops supports earlier biochemical inferences. The experimental data confirm the proposed two-site cooperative reaction mechanism of EcoRII. A DNA fragment of 1202-bp length containing two EcoRII recognition sequences, was obtained by XmnI and AflIII digestion of pUC18 DNA. The DNA fragment was purified by gel extraction. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 10 min in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 40 fmol of DNA and 40 fmol of enzyme in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 1 mmCa(OAc)2; 100 mm KOAc; 2 mmdithiothreitol with or without 5 mm Mg(OAc)2. Complexes were fixed and directly adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica as described (16Spiess E. Lurz R. Methods Microbiol. 1988; 20: 293-323Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Micrographs were taken using a Philips CM100 electron microscope at 100 kV and a primary magnification of 15,500×. To determine the contour length, measurements were carried out on projections of negatives using a digitizer (LM4, Brühl, Nuremberg, Germany). Substrates of 282-bp length labeled on one strand were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a 32P-labeled/unlabeled primer pair. 260 fmol of DNA were incubated for 30 min at 0 °C with increasing amounts of enzyme in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; 1 mmCa(OAc)2; 100 mm KOAc; 2 mmdithiothreitol; 5 mm Mg(OAc)2; 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. After adding 0.025 unit of DNase I, the reaction was incubated at 0 °C for 5 min and stopped with 1 volume of 1% SDS; 200 mm NaCl; 20 mm EDTA. Following ethanol precipitation, DNA was separated by an 8% denaturing SDS-PAGE. DNA was sequenced using the PCR template, 32P-labeled PCR primers, and the Thermosequenase Cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the DNA sequence encoding EcoRII and the expression and purification of mutant and wt EcoRII followed the procedures described previously (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D.

The32P-labeled 191-bp PCR product (0.025 pmol) containing one EcoRII recognition site was incubated with increasing amounts of the enzyme (0.06–2 pmol) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Detailed experimental procedures were performed according to a previous study (15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We analyzed the time dependence of the cleavage activity of both enzymes by incubating 1.2 pmol of BamHI-linearized pBR322 Dcm− DNA with 3.6 pmol of the respective enzyme in a reaction volume of 160 μl containing 1× universal buffer (Stratagene) at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed over 2 h and immediately placed at −20 °C. Cleavage products were run on 0.8% agarose gels and quantitated by Phoretix 1D Software (Biostep Labor- und Systemtechnik GmbH, Jahnsdorf, Germany). Cleavage efficiency was determined as the quotient of uncleaved substrate and total DNA per lane. Cleavage activity in trans was analyzed at 37 °C for 30 min after incubating 4 pmol of a one-site oligonucleotide duplex (30 bp) with 2 pmol of EcoRII wt and V258N, respectively, containing 1× universal buffer (Stratagene) in a 20-μl reaction volume. Cleavage products were separated by a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo, Japan) using a 1-ml cuvette with 0.2-mm path length. Protein preparations were of ≥95% purity, and the concentration was about 0.29 mg/ml. Ten measurements were taken at 250- to 195-nm wavelength using a scan rate of 10 nm/min and a step resolution of 0.2 nm. Data were analyzed using k2D software (17Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Moran F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 1-12Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). First dimension native electrophoresis was performed according to previous studies (19Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar,20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar) using 20 μg of EcoRII wt and 20 μg of V258N protein on a 5–18% linear acrylamide gradient gel. Marker proteins were lactate dehydrogenase (140 and 280 kDa), hexokinase (99 kDa), conalbumin (78 kDa), albumin (66 and 132 kDa), and β-lactoglobulin (35 kDa). Seven independent experiments were performed, each including a molecular mass calibration. The calibration curve fit a logarithmic function. Second dimension 12% SDS-PAGE was run according to the procedure described previously (19Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Molecular mass analyses were carried out in a XL-A-type analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) with UV absorbance scanner optics. The sedimentation equilibrium was analyzed using externally loaded six-channel centerpieces of 12-mm optical path length usually filled with 70 μl of each protein solution. Three of these cells were used to analyze different samples in one run simultaneously. Sedimentation equilibrium was reached after 2 h of overspeed at 18,000 rpm, followed by an equilibrium speed of 14,000 rpm at 10 °C for 24–30 h. The radial absorbancies of each compartment were scanned at 275, 280, and 285 nm, using the molecular absorption coefficients determined with EcoRII wt. Average molecular mass was calculated by simultaneously fitting the sets of three radial distribution curves as described previously (21Behlke J. Heidrich K. Naumann M. Muller E.C. Otto A. Kriegel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11989-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of EcoRII harbors two distinct DNA-binding regions (I, aa 88–102 and II, aa 256–273) (15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses supported the significance of these two DNA-binding regions (15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Searching for similar peptides in other ENases, we found a strong local homology of EcoRII-binding region II with SsoII (aa 110–127) and some sequence conservation with other ENases that have terminal C:G or G:C base pairs in their recognition sequences in common (15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additional support for the importance of DNA-binding region II is provided by investigations on the newly discovered EcoRII-homoisoschizomer PspGI that showed significant similarity to EcoRII binding site II in a segment of 87 aa residues (22Morgan R. Xiao J.-P. Xu S.-Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3669-3673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we examined the role of single amino acid residues of EcoRII DNA-binding region II in target-site recognition and catalytic activity. Taking into account the similarity between EcoRII (CCWGG) and SsoII (CCNGG), we exchanged non-conserved amino acids within the homologous region. One of these positions is the non-polar Val258 in EcoRII, which was substituted by a polar Asn residue as found in the corresponding amino acid position in SsoII. The resulting EcoRII mutant enzyme V258N was expressed with N-terminal His6-tag and purified to 95% homogeneity following a procedure described previously (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To prove the ability of EcoRII to cooperate with two copies of its recognition site, we analyzed complexes of the enzyme with different DNA substrates by means of transmission electron microscopy. The interaction of EcoRII with a 1202-bp linear DNA substrate containing two EcoRII recognition sites 191 bp apart gave rise to DNA loop formation (Fig.1 a). The asymmetric location of the two EcoRII sites in this particular DNA molecule allowed us to distinguish one DNA end from the other. In contrast, the binding of EcoRII to a single site substrate did not induce DNA looping (data not shown). We analyzed 90 of the looped DNA molecules by measuring the contour length of the three respective regions (short DNA end, DNA loop, long DNA end). Thus, we determined that DNA loop formation occurred specifically between the EcoRII recognition sites (Fig. 1 b). However, we also observed EcoRII protein complexes bound to the DNA molecule without loop formation (Fig. 1 a). The frequency of loop formation by wt EcoRII and mutant V258N was determined in the presence or absence of Mg2+(Fig. 1 c). In the presence of Mg2+, wt EcoRII formed loop structures with 18.4% of the total DNA molecules, but the mutant V258N formed loop structures only with 3.3%. Without Mg2+, 25.4% of the DNA molecules formed loops with wt EcoRII and 6% with the mutant enzyme. The reduction of DNA loop formation in the presence of Mg2+ can be due to increased specificity of DNA binding. From these data it became obvious that the single amino acid substitution of Asn for Val258 led to a significantly reduced interaction between two recognition sites. The decreased DNA loop formation by the mutant V258N compared with wt EcoRII is independent of the addition of Mg2+. To define the DNA region mediating the specific wt EcoRII- and V258N-substrate interaction, DNase I footprinting analyses were performed using a DNA substrate containing two EcoRII recognition sites 82 bp apart. Fig. 2shows the footprinting patterns of wt EcoRII and mutant V258N either at the CCAGG sequence or at the CCTGG sequence of two EcoRII recognition sites (Fig. 2, a and b). With increasing concentrations of wt EcoRII and mutant V258N, respectively, DNase I digestion of the DNA seems to be blocked to a similar extent in the A and T strand of both recognition sites. The footprints were detectable at an enzyme-to-site ratio of 10 in both cases (lanes 6 and 10). DNase I footprints due to specific DNA binding of EcoRII are 16–18 bp long. Footprints were located symmetrically in both strands of one recognition site (data not shown). Mutant V258N revealed the same DNase I footprinting pattern, demonstrating that specific recognition of the double stranded EcoRII sequence was not altered by the introduced amino acid replacement. Substituting Asn for Val258led to changes in the protein-DNA complex. Complexes formed by mutant V258N enzyme exhibited significantly higher electrophoretic mobility than those complexes formed by the wt enzyme (Fig.3 a). To verify that formation of the faster migrating complex relies on the specific interaction of mutant V258N with the EcoRII recognition sequence, competition experiments were performed. A 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled unspecific oligonucleotides did not reduce complex formation. In contrast, the DNA-protein complexes completely disappeared due to the addition of the same concentration of unlabeled specific competitor DNA. Because of the increased electrophoretic mobility, we expected significant deviations in the molecular composition of the V258N protein-DNA complex. Using constant low substrate concentration and increasing excess of the respective protein, we calculated the KD(app) according to a previous study (15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The KD(app) of both wt EcoRII and mutant V258N was 5 nm, indicating that the DNA-binding affinity was unaffected by the amino acid replacement. The DNA cleavage activity of wt EcoRII and V258N protein was assayed on linearized pBR322 DNA. In contrast to the unchanged substrate recognition shown by KD(app) values and DNase I footprints, the cleavage activity of V258N reached only approximately 16% of the wt enzyme activity (Fig. 3 b). In addition, we compared the cleavage reactions of both proteins using 30-bp oligonucleotide substrates harboring a single recognition site. In contrast to wt EcoRII, V258N was incapable of cleaving these substrates that require DNA binding in trans (data not shown). CD spectra of wt EcoRII and mutant V258N did not reveal remarkable changes in the secondary structure distribution. The percentages of α-helix and β-sheet structures were 27 and 23% for EcoRII wt and 31 and 10% for the V258N mutant enzyme, respectively. To gain insight into the altered composition of the V258N enzyme-substrate complex, we examined both enzymes by two-dimensional PAGE. In the denaturing SDS-PAGE,EcoRII wt and mutant V258N migrated as one main band of 46 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of an EcoRII monomer (Fig. 4 a). In contrast, native electrophoresis of the wt and the mutant enzyme elucidated remarkable differences in the composition of both protein solutions (Fig.4 b). The apparent molecular masses of wt EcoRII and V258N mutant bands were estimated by direct fit to a logarithmic calibration curve. EcoRII wt mainly consisted of a component with an apparent molecular mass of 104.7 kDa (band 2), coinciding with the homodimer, and of two minor protein fractions of about 240 kDa (band 1) and 59.5 kDa (band 3). These could correspond to a tetrameric and monomeric protein structure, respectively. The mutant protein solution showed three bands of similar intensity to each other with apparent molecular masses of 156.7, 101.5, and 59.1 kDa. These mutant V258N bands are in agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of the protein trimer, dimer, and monomer, respectively. The EcoRII specificity of the described protein bands has been verified by Western blot (data not shown). We analyzed natively separated protein bands in the second dimension by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 c). Thus, we confirmed that the bands of the wt and the mutant enzyme, respectively, resolved in the first dimension, displayed a molecular mass corresponding to that of an EcoRII monomer. In response to the amino acid replacement Val258 to Asn, enzyme dimerization was strongly destabilized and the dimer-tetramer equilibrium of wt EcoRII (with a pronounced preference for the dimeric form) was shifted to a monomer-dimer equilibrium. To characterize the oligomeric nature of the wt EcoRII and the mutant enzyme in solution under equilibrium conditions and to evaluate the affinity of the protein subunits, we determined the concentration dependence of the average molecular mass by sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Fig.5 shows extrapolated graphs of the concentration dependence of the average molecular mass of the wt EcoRII and the mutant assuming a monomer-dimer equilibrium. Whereas the molecular mass of wt EcoRII did not differ with protein concentration and was determined to be 92 kDa consistent with the homodimeric form, the molecular mass of V258N depended on the protein concentration. In the examined protein concentration range of 35–100 μg/ml, molecular mass values varied from 66 to 77 kDa. These values lie between the EcoRII monomer (46 kDa) and dimer (92 kDa), thus, supporting a state of equilibrium of the monomeric and the dimeric form of the mutant. Assuming a monomer-dimer equilibrium, the dimer dissociation constants KD of V258N and wt EcoRII were calculated from the concentration dependence of the molecular mass to be 0.99 (± 0.06) μm and 2.89 (± 1.08) nm, respectively. This indicates a 350-fold decrease in dimer stability for the V258N mutant. R261S, another mutant within DNA binding site II, showed two enzyme-specific bands in native gel electrophoresis corresponding to the molecular mass of monomer and dimer (not shown). Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed a monomer-dimer equilibrium of R261S with a KD for protein dimerization of 77.8 (± 9.5) nm (Fig. 5). This represents a 25-fold destabilization of the protein dimer. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments validated the prediction that substitution of Asn for Val258 substantially destabilizes the dimeric protein structure. In addition, one can assume that Arg261 plays a significant role in EcoRII dimerization. Type II ENases are homodimers in solution and interact as such with their substrate (23Aggarwal A.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Each of the identical monomeric subunits mediates half of the specific protein-DNA contacts and possesses one catalytic center to catalyze the phosphodiester bond hydrolysis of one single strand of the double stranded DNA recognition site. EcoRII also exists as a homodimer in solution but, unlike most type II ENases, must bind two recognition sites simultaneously, either in cis or in trans, for effective DNA cleavage (1Krüger D.H. Kupper D. Meisel A. Reuter M. Schroeder C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric data indicated a functionally active complex composed of one EcoRII dimer and two DNA recognition sites (12Petrauskene O.V. Karpova E.A. Gromova E.S. Guschlbauer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Interaction with two target DNA sites has also been described for the type II ENases SfiI and Cfr10I, except that both of these are functionally active as tetramers.SfiI and Cfr10I cleave the double stranded DNA of two recognition sites in a concerted reaction. This corresponds to the cleavage of a single strand by each subunit of the tetramer (10Siksnys V. Skirgaila R. Sasnauskas G. Urbanke C. Cherny D. Grazulis S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Nobbs T.J. Szczelkun M.D. Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One catalytic center per enzyme subunit seems to be a common theme among type II ENases, raising the question of how the EcoRII homodimer achieves the hydrolysis of two double stranded EcoRII recognition sites. We observed that two cooperating EcoRII recognition sites in a linear DNA molecule are cleaved regardless of the Lac repressor blocking the continuity of the intervening DNA. Furthermore,EcoRII cleavage diminishes with the increasing distance of the two cooperating recognition sites in cis due to decreased local concentration of recognition sites (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These two facts combined with a well characterized substrate cooperativity (11Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18623-18630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Petrauskene O.V. Karpova E.A. Gromova E.S. Guschlbauer W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Kupper D. Reuter M. Mackeldanz P. Meisel A. Alves J. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) support the hypothesis that EcoRII communicates between remote recognition sites on one DNA molecule via loop formation. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualize the capability of the dimeric enzyme to form specific DNA loops after binding at two sites simultaneously. The proportion of approximately 20% of loops formed by the wt EcoRII is consistent with the cleavage efficiency of 23.8% for a DNA substrate with two sites separated by the same distance (191 bp) (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this cleavage assay conditions allowed EcoRII interaction with the target sites in cis exclusively. Therefore, the low cleavage efficiency can be attributed to the decreased loop stability and loop formation probability due to increasing site distance (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reduced loop formation by the monomeric mutant V258N enzyme indicates that induction of DNA looping by EcoRII directly depends on it being an intact dimer. We assume that a residual portion of dimeric V258N mutant species mediated the observed loops. Cleavage efficiencies exerted by both enzymes mirror the loop formation frequencies displayed by wt EcoRII and V258N. These results illustrate that the complex of the EcoRII dimer with two copies of the recognition sequence represents the active form and is, likewise, the precondition for the concerted hydrolysis of four phosphodiester bonds. So far, direct electron microscopic evidence for a type IIE enzyme-induced DNA loop formation was exclusively available for NaeI (26Topal M.D. Thresher R.J. Conrad M. Griffith J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Very recently Siksnys et al. (10Siksnys V. Skirgaila R. Sasnauskas G. Urbanke C. Cherny D. Grazulis S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) visualized that the reaction of the tetrameric type II ENase Cfr10I included an intermediate DNA loop structure, and Wentzell and Halford (27Wentzell L.M. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggested the same for the SfiI tetramer after investigating DNA cleavage rates of plasmids with differently spaced sites. The DNase I footprinting patterns of EcoRII symmetrically spanned 16–18 bases of both DNA strands of one recognition site, as one would expect for a 2-fold rotational symmetry of EcoRII similar to most type II ENases that bind symmetrically to the DNA helix. Neither the wt nor the mutant V258N enzyme seem to discriminate between the A or T strand. This is consistent with the facts that EcoRII accepts central A/A and T/T mismatches within its recognition sequence (28Yolov A.A. Gromova E.S. Romanova E.A. Oretskaya T.S. Oganov A.A. Buryanov Y.I. Shabarova Z.A. FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that the recognition site orientation does not influence EcoRII cleavage activity (14Reuter M. Kupper D. Meisel A. Schroeder C. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8294-8300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The protected DNA region had been estimated earlier for EcoRII to be 21 ± 1 bp using dissociation kinetics of the protein bound to synthetic concatemeric DNA substrates (29Vinogradova M.V. Gromova E.S. Kosykh V.G. Buryanov Y.I. Shabarova Z.A. Mol. Biol. (Moscow). 1990; 24: 847-850PubMed Google Scholar). Our DNase I footprinting data reduced the protected DNA region to 16–18 bp. The mutant V258N enzyme revealed no differences in its DNA recognition properties when compared with wt EcoRII, confirming that the binding capacity for a double stranded EcoRII recognition site resides in the monomeric subunit of the enzyme. Bands resulting from hypersensitivity toward DNase I cleavage around the footprint were possibly consequences of structural deformation, such as DNA bending or kinking, induced by the binding of the enzyme. Such distortions are thought to be a structural basis of cooperativity between DNA target sites at a short distance (30Rudnick J. Bruinsma R. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1725-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The monomeric character of the mutant enzyme V258N was independently documented by molecular mass determinations and oligomeric state analyses using analytical ultracentrifugation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We could verify that V258N exists in a monomer/dimer equilibrium with distinct concentration dependence. The protein dimerization was destabilized 350-fold compared with the wt. Another mutant of EcoRII, R261S, located only three amino acids farther away in the C-terminal direction, also showed decreased dimer stability, but the weakening was not as severe as that for V258N. This led us to conclude that both amino acids contribute to a putative dimer-interface region and that multiple amino acid interactions are responsible for oligomerization. The same experimental procedures confirmed the dimeric character of EcoRII wt in solution and distinguished it from functional active tetrameric ENases such as Cfr10I and SfiI. The determined molecular masses and oligomeric states supported our assumption that the V258N mutant specifically binds to the DNA as a monomer, whereas the wt enzyme binds in its dimeric form. A proteolytic C-terminal fragment of NaeI (aa 169–317), another type IIE ENase, was shown to be monomeric in solution but still capable to form complexes with cognate double stranded DNA (31Colandene J.D. Topal M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3531-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Together with the NaeI crystal structure (32Huai Q. Colandene J.D. Chen Y. Luo F. Zhao Y. Topal M.D. Ke H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3110-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these data could support the idea that a monomeric subunit of type IIE ENases comprises the DNA recognition elements for a single recognition site. Cleavage activity of V258N mutant enzyme on linearized pBR322 DNA molecules decreased to 16% of wt activity. Because DNA binding affinity as well as secondary structure distribution of V258N remained nearly unaffected, we consider the destabilization of protein-protein interactions at the dimer interface to be responsible for the reduced capability to interact cooperatively. Moreover, cleavage in trans using oligonucleotide duplexes containing one recognition site could not be observed for the mutant V258N. We assume this is due to the weak V258N protein-protein contact that, although allowing a residual cleavage of pBR322 DNA in cis, seems not to be stable enough to support the formation of the active complex with two independent DNA substrates. These data strengthen our hypothesis of a catalytic inactive enzyme monomer-DNA complex and demonstrate that amino acids essential for dimerization and catalysis are tightly interwoven. However, it contradicts a recently published model that proposed that the EcoRII monomer is catalytically active when complexed with one target DNA sequence (33Karpova E.A. Kubareva E.A. Shabarova Z.A. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 91-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The EcoRII monomeric mutant differs from the described monomers of EcoRI and Cfr10I with regard to its DNA binding and cleavage behavior. Kim et al. (34Kim J.J. Koh S. Kim J.S. Lee D.S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 31: 149-155Google Scholar) stated that active monomeric forms of EcoRI wt and its variant N199H recognize and cleave single stranded DNA substrates. However, both enzymes retained a considerable capability to dimerize, which was dependent on electrolyte concentration. Another monomeric EcoRI mutant (L158D) was found to be completely unable to dimerize and showed only unspecific nicking activity. 2J. Alves, personal communication. This emphasizes that specific target recognition and cleavage by typical type II enzymes are usually intertwined with dimerization. In contrast to the monomeric EcoRI mutants, the monomeric EcoRII mutant V258N is still able to bind its double stranded recognition site. It has been suggested that the Cfr10I mutant W220A existing in monomer-dimer equilibrium is able to bind to the double stranded substrate DNA only in the dimeric form, but lacks DNA-binding capability as a monomer (10Siksnys V. Skirgaila R. Sasnauskas G. Urbanke C. Cherny D. Grazulis S. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1105-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, EcoRII mutant V258N is the first observed monomeric ENase variant that retains the property of specifically recognizing the double stranded recognition site. Although EcoRI and Cfr10I enzyme variants are consistent with the arrangement of one-half substrate binding site and one catalytic center per monomer, EcoRII monomers apparently possess a complete DNA substrate binding cleft and possibly two active sites (15Reuter M. Schneider-Mergener J. Kupper D. Meisel A. Mackeldanz P. Krüger D.H. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5213-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our mutational analyses within DNA-binding regions I (aa 88–102) and II (aa 256–273) revealed the positions Glu96 and Glu271 to be essential for DNA hydrolysis by EcoRII. Both Glu residues may be considered to be part of potential catalytic consensus motifs of type II ENases (77PD X18EKR98and215PD X55ELH273, where the Glu residues are underlined) (15Reuter M.

Reuter, unpublished data. Recently it has been reported that the monomeric PI-SceI endonuclease achieves specific hydrolysis of both DNA strands by two active sites per monomer (35Christ F. Schoettler S. Wende W. Steuer S. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6908-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results encourage further investigation on the number and architecture of EcoRII active site(s). To summarize, we conclude that one monomer of the homodimeric EcoRII alone possesses the structural elements for DNA recognition. Subsequent to the primary binding event at one recognition site, the second subunit cooperatively binds to another recognition site culminating in the formation of the catalytic active complex that, after a conformational change, triggers the cleavage reaction. Thus, the dimeric status of the EcoRII ENase is an essential prerequisite for cooperative substrate binding. We assume that each monomeric subunit contributes one DNA-binding cleft, which is comprised of the DNA-binding regions I and II interwoven with each other and with catalytic residues and which is able to hydrolyze two single strands. Hence, four DNA strands of two coordinated recognition sites can be cleaved in a concerted reaction. Considering that an EcoRII monomer is sufficient to bind specifically to the recognition sequence and that EcoRII can hydrolyze the two phosphodiester bonds of one recognition site in one event (36Petrauskene O.V. Babkina O.V. Tashlitsky V.N. Kazankov G.M. Gromova E.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), two catalytic sites in one monomer could be postulated. Cleavage activation due to the essential binding of a second recognition site should be reflected in a network of amino acid residues associated with DNA recognition, protein dimerization, and DNA hydrolysis. This hypothesis has to be proven in further structural analyses. We are grateful to C. Speck, W. Messer, and G. Lüder for their help in DNase I footprinting and electron microscopy. We thank H. Xu and W. Saenger for recording CD spectra and E. Möncke-Buchner and U. Scherneck for skillful technical assistance. J. Alves, A. Pingoud, and V.

https://openalex.org/W2143538706,"We showed previously that the rat branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) kinase is capable of autophosphorylation. However, despite its sequence similarity to bacterial histidine protein kinases, BCKD kinase does not function as a histidine protein kinase. In the present study, we report that the rat BCKD kinase exists as a homotetramer of Mr = 185,000, based on results of gel filtration and dynamic light scattering. This is in contrast to the related mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozymes that occur as homodimers. The tetrameric assembly of BCKD kinase was confirmed by the presence of four 5′-adenylyl-imidodiphosphate-binding sites (KD = 4.1 × 10−6m) per molecule of the kinase. Incubation of the BCKD kinase with increasing concentrations of urea resulted in dissociation of the tetramer to dimers and eventually to monomers as separated on a sucrose density gradient. Both tetramers and dimers, but not the monomer, maintained the conformation capable of binding ATP and undergoing autophosphorylation. BCKD kinase depends on a fully lipoylated transacylase for maximal activity, but the interaction between the kinase and the transacylase is impeded in the presence of high salt concentrations. Alterations of conserved residues in the ATP-binding domain led to a marked reduction or complete loss in the catalytic efficiency of the BCKD kinase.

The mammalian BCKD complex is a macromolecule (Mr = 4 × 106) comprising multiple copies of five component enzymes. The three catalytic components are as follows: a thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent branched-chain α-ketoacid decarboxylase (E1) with two E1α (Mr = 45, 500) and two E1β (Mr = 37, 500) subunits; a dihydrolipoyl transacylase (E2), which contains 24 lipoate-bearing polypeptides (monomer, Mr = 45,000); and a dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3) (monomer, Mr = 55,000) (1Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 247: 625-632Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, the BCKD complex contains two regulatory enzymes, a specific kinase (2Harris R.A. Paxton R. Powell S.M. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Han A.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1986; 25: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and a specific phosphatase (3Damuni Z. Merryfield M.L. Humphreys J.S. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The BCKD complex is organized around the 24-mer dihydrolipoyl transacylase cubic core (Mr = 1.1 × 106), to which E1, E3, the kinase, and the phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions. The regulation of the activity of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex through a kinase-mediated phosphorylation has been extensively studied. Rats fed low protein diets showed low hepatic enzyme complex activity (2Harris R.A. Paxton R. Powell S.M. Goodwin G.W. Kuntz M.J. Han A.C. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1986; 25: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is associated with a reduction in the activity state, or the percent of total enzyme in the dephosphorylated form, of the enzyme compared with rats fed a normal diet (2Harris R.A. Paxton R.

Administration of glucagon or epinephrine was shown to result in a 4-fold increase in the percentage of active (dephosphorylated) enzyme complex in the liver of rats fed a low protein diet; somewhat lesser effects were observed with administration of insulin and cyclic AMP (7Block K.P.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the rat BCKD kinase shows little similarity to mammalian serine/threonine protein kinases. Instead a much higher degree of sequence similarity exists between the BCKD kinase and members of the prokaryotic histidine protein kinase family (8Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13127-13130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subsequent cloning and characterization of the four isoforms of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase support the notion that PDH kinases belong to the ATPase/kinase superfamily (9Bowker-Kinley M. Popov K.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Kedishvili N.Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CheA, a signal-transducing histidine protein kinase, has been recently solved at 2.8-Å resolution (11Bilwes A.M. Alex L.A. Crane B.R. Simon M.I. Cell. 1999; 96: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The structure resembles GyrB and Hsp90 and, as expected, displays little similarity to serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases. The P1 domain of CheA provides the nucleophilic histidine and activated glutamate that are essential for phosphotransfer. The regulatory domain, which binds the homologous receptor, CheW, topologically resembles two SH3 domains. The dimerization domain forms a central 4-helix bundle about which the ATP-binding and the regulatory domains rotate to modulate transphosphorylation. To understand structure and function of the mammalian BCKD kinase, we previously expressed and characterized the rat enzyme (12Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M. Huang Y.-S. Aalund G. Chuang D.T. Lau K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19861-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We showed that the BCKD kinase is autophosphorylated at a serine residue in the conserved P1 region of histidine protein kinases. However, despite its sequence similarity to histidine protein kinase, the BCKD kinase does not utilize histidine to mediate phosphotransfer. In the present study, we further characterize the recombinant rat BCKD kinase. We provide evidence to indicate that, unlike dimeric PDH and CheA histidine protein kinases, the rat BCKD kinase is a homotetramer. Moreover, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis studies, which establish that residues in the ATP-binding domain of BCKD kinase are highly conserved in the context of the ATPase/kinase superfamily. The previously prepared pMAL-TEV kinase vector (12Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M. Huang Y.-S. Aalund G. Chuang D.T. Lau K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19861-19867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was treated with XbaI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, and the resulting 1,182-base pair fragment was cloned into an NheI-EcoRI-treated pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) to generate the N-terminally His6-tagged pTrcHis6TEV kinase (pHisT kinase) expression vector. A C-terminally His6-tagged expression vector (pKinase-His) was also produced by PCR amplification of the pMAL-TEV kinase vector using a 31-mer sense primer (sequence 5′-AAACCATGGGCTCAAC ATCAGCCACCGATAC-3′) and a 52-mer antisense primer (sequence 5′-CGAATTCAATGATGATGATGATGATGACCCCCGATTCTGAAGCTTTCCTCCC-3′); the sense primer introduced a unique NcoI restriction site (underlined) into the 5′-coding region, and the antisense primer contained a unique EcoRI restriction site (underlined) at the 3′-noncoding region of the amplified product. The 1,371-base pair amplification product was purified and treated with NcoI-EcoRI restriction endonucleases, and the resulting 1,367-base pair fragment was cloned into an NcoI-EcoRI-treated pTrcHisB (Invitrogen) to generate the C-terminally His6-tagged pTrc kinase-His6 expression vector (pKinase-His). All kinase proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain CG-712 co-transformed with the pGroESL plasmid for overexpression of GroEL and GroES as described previously (13Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 12-h expression, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended in 5 volumes (w/v) of a lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.0% (v/v) Tween 20, 0.2 mmbenzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) with 2.0 mg/ml of lysozyme added. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cell lysate was sonicated using a Branson Sonifier model 450 (1-cm tip, power setting 6, duty cycle 60%, for 8 min) and subsequently clarified by centrifugation at 29,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Purification of MBP kinase from clarified cell lysates by amylose affinity chromatography was performed as described previously (13Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His6-tagged kinases (N- and C-terminally) were purified by extraction of the cell lysates with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) (14Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient. Ten milligrams of affinity-purified His6 kinase was applied to a calibrated Superdex-200 gel filtration column connected to an FPLC system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The column buffer included 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mml-arginine, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 5 mm dithioerythritol, and 1 mm benzamidine. Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus protein reagent from Pierce or by direct measurement of A280 nm. The Altered Site in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to introduce desired mutations into the kinase cDNA. Detailed protocols of the mutagenic vector construction and subsequent mutagenesis were described previously (15Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Chinsky J.M. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides for N249A, D289A, Y301A, G339A substitutions, and the β-lactamase repair primer were annealed to the single-stranded form of pAlter kinase vector. After the second strand synthesis and transformation and two rounds of ampicillin selection, clones were isolated for plasmid preparation. DNA segments containing these introduced mutations were used for cassette replacements of the corresponding wild-type DNA segment in prokaryotic expression vector pMAL-TEV kinase (12Davie J.R.

The following oligonucleotides were used for introducing alanine mutations, which are underlined: N249A, 5′-CTGCTCAAGGCCGCCATGAGAGCC-3′; G289A, 5′-CGGGGTGGAGCGATCGCTCATAAG-3′; Y301A, 5′-GTCATGGAGGCCCACTTCACCACA-3′; and G339A, 5′-GGCTTTGGCTTCGCGTTGCCCACGTCC-3′. Construction of the wild-type and mutant E1 expression vector containing S302A-α (a phosphorylation site 2 mutant) was described previously (12Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Meng M. Huang Y.-S. Aalund G.

Vector construction and purification of His6-E1 were also described previously (14Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Full-length mature bovine E2 was expressed in E. coli strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and purified as described previously (16Griffin T.A. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12104-12110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the preparation of lipoylated E2, the recombinant apoE2 protein was treated with the E. coli lipoyl ligase LplA anddl-6,8-thioctic acid (lipoic acid, Sigma) as described elsewhere (17Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamic light scattering measurements were carried out using a DP-801 DLS instrument from Protein Solutions (Charlottesville, VA) interfaced with a Mitsuba computer. Samples of N-terminally tagged His6 kinase (1.0 mg/ml), His6-E1 (1.1 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml), and lysozyme (3 mg/ml) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 250 mmKCl, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA were filtered through a Whatman membrane of 0.45-μm pore size, and manually injected into the instrument. Samples (250 μl) in the flow cell at 22 °C were illuminated with an incident beam from a 25-milliwatt, 790 nm solid-state laser. The photons scattered by protein molecules moving in the Brownian motion were collected at an angle of 90°. The distribution of diffusion coefficients derived from the autocorrelation function was determined using a method of non-negative least squares laplacian transformation (regularization) contained in the Dynamics 4.0 software package from the manufacturer. The hydrodynamic (Stokes) radius (RH) of the molecules was derived from the Stokes-Einstein equation (Equation 1). RH=kT/6pηDEquation 1 where η, k, and T are viscosity, the Boltzmann constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively (18MacColl R. Halak H. Gryczynski I. Eisele L.E. Mizejewski G.J. Franklin E. Sheikh H. Montellese D. Hipkins S. MacColl L.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The corresponding molecular mass (M) was calculated according to Equation 2: RH=[(3/4p)(M/N0)(υh)]1/3Equation 2 where No is Avogadro's number, v(0.73 cm3/g) is the partial specific volume of the protein, and h (1.3) is the hydration for soluble proteins. His6 kinase (50 μg/100 μl) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol was incubated at the indicated urea concentrations for 1 h at 23 °C. Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) matrix was equilibrated at various urea concentrations prior to the addition to the urea-treated kinase. The urea-treated Affi-Gel Blue resin with the urea-treated kinase was incubated for 10 min at 23 °C. Following the incubation, the samples were spun in a microcentrifuge, and the resin was washed with the appropriate urea-containing buffer. Samples bound to the resin were eluted with 10 mm Mg-ATP, and the eluted and flow-through fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To test its ability to undergo autophosphorylation, His6 kinase (100 μg) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol was incubated at the indicated urea concentrations for 1 h at 23 °C. Autophosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 0.1 Ci/mmol) and allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. The samples were denatured and separated on SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging. The enzymatic assay for BCKD kinase was based on the kinase-mediated inactivation of E1. For determinations of kinase activity, recombinant proteins of E1 (50 μg/ml, 250 nm), lipoylated E2 (37.5 μg/ml, 34 nm), and MBP kinase (25 μg/ml, 125 nm) with various concentrations of Mg-ATP in 100 μl were incubated at 37 °C for 5 or 10 min. At different times, aliquots were collected and assayed for the BCKD complex activity using a reconstituted spectrophotometric assay in the presence of excess recombinant E2 and E3 (17Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 413-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residual BCKD activity were plotted against the time to derive the kobs values at different ATP concentrations. The double-reciprocal plots of kobs versus ATP concentrations were used to determine the Km and kcat values for ATP in the kinase-mediated inactivation of E1 (19Silverman R.B. Method Enzymol. 1995; 249: 240-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). MBP kinase (7.5 μm) was mixed with different concentrations of AMP-PNP (20, 25, 30, 40, and 80 μm) in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 200 mm KCl in a final volume of 0.5 ml, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation, each mixture was loaded onto a CentriCon-30 concentrator (Mr 30,000 cut-off) and spun at 2500 × g for 5 min so that about 0.15 ml of filtrate was obtained. The concentration of AMP-PNP filtrate ([AMP-PNP] f) was determined by A259 nm, and the concentration of enzyme-bound AMP-PNP ([AMP-PNP] b) was derived from [AMP-PNP] t − [AMP-PNP] f , where [AMP-PNP] t is the total ligand concentration. Scatchard analysis was carried out by plotting [AMP-PNP] b against [AMP-PNP] b /[AMP-PNP] f . To calculate the total AMP-PNP-binding sites [BS] t , the equation [AMP-PNP] b = [BS] t − ([AMP-PNP] b /[AMP-PNP] f) ×KD was used. MBP kinase (1.5 mg/ml, 4.5 μm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 200 mm KCl was incubated with 150 μm γ-35S-ATP (616, 500 cpm/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. The mixture was transferred to a CentriCon-30 concentrator (Mr 30,000 cut-off) and spun at 2,500 ×g for 15 min. The concentration of the γ-35S-ATP in the filtrate and retentate were determined by liquid scintillation counting. The His6 kinase of the rat BCKD complex with a His6 tag and a tobacco-etch virus (TEV) protease site connected to the N terminus of the E1α subunit was expressed in E. coli. Following extraction with Ni-NTA resin, the enzyme was further purified by FPLC Superdex-200 gel filtration. An elution profile from the calibrated Superdex-200 column shows a single peak with a molecular weight of 185,000 (Fig.1). Based on the calculated subunit Mr = 46,117, the His6 kinase exists as a homotetramer in solution. The apparent tetrameric assembly of His6 kinase was further studied by dynamic light scattering. Fig.2 shows the Stokes radius of the same His6 kinase from eight different measurements. The data give an average of Mr = 180,000. The same dynamic light scattering with His6-E1 produced a size of Mr = 167,000 (Fig. 2), which is consistent with that determined by gel filtration (14Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The size of His6kinase was further studied by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The enzyme migrated as a Mr = 180,000 species on the gradient (10–30%) in the presence and absence of 10 mm ATP, ADP, or AMP-PNP (data not shown). These results, taken together, corroborate the notion that the His6 kinase is a homotetramer. A frictional coefficient ratio (f/f0) (1.06 × 10−7/8.5 × 10−8) = 1.26 for the His6kinase was obtained also by dynamic light scattering. This number deviates from a frictional ratio of f/f0 1.12 for a hydrated sphere, suggesting that the tetrameric His6 kinase has a slightly elongated quaternary structure.Figure 2Molecular mass determination of His6 kinase by dynamic light scattering. The His6 kinase (1 mg/ml, ■) sample (250 μl) was injected into a flow cell, and dynamic light scattering was measured. The Stokes radius was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” using the software package Dynamic version 4.0. The computer calculated Stokes radius for lysozyme (3 mg/ml, ▵), bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml, ○), and His6-tagged E1 (1.5 mg/ml, ⋄) were plotted against sample number. The molecular mass markers used for the calibration were as follows: lysozyme (14 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and His6-tagged E1 (171 kDa). The molecular mass for the His6 kinase derived from its Stokes radius is 167 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the homotetrameric structure of the BCKD kinase, the number of ATP-binding sites on MBP kinase was determined by two separate methods. We first incubated MBP kinase with increasing concentrations of AMP-PNP for 30 min at 4 °C. The free ligand was separated from the bound by centrifugation in CentriCon-30 microconcentrators. Scatchard plot analysis indicates 3.7 mol of AMP-PNP bound per mol of MBP kinase (Fig.3). The result is consistent with four AMP-PNP-binding sites in an MBP kinase tetramer. The same analysis gave rise to a KD of 4.1 × 10−6m for AMP-PNP binding to MBP kinase. In a parallel experiment, we found that 3.5 mol of γ-35S-ATP are bound to 1 mol of MBP kinase (data not shown). These data agree with four ATP-binding sites in each BCKD kinase tetramer. To study the assembly state of His6 kinase further, the enzyme was incubated with increasing concentrations of urea at 23 °C for 1 h. The urea-treated samples were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of the same concentration of urea, and separated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4 A, His6 kinase sedimented as a tetramer in up to 1m urea. In 2 m urea, the enzyme existed almost exclusively as dimers. At 3 m urea concentration, the enzyme still occurred predominantly as dimers but began to dissociate into smaller monomeric species. His6 kinase was dissociated into essentially monomers in 4 m urea. The results confirmed the tetrameric assembly of His6 kinase. The conformation of urea-denatured His6 kinase was studied by circular dichroism. At up to 2 m urea concentration, His6 kinase maintained its α-helical conformation, similar to the native untreated enzyme, with minimal changes in molar ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 4 B). The secondary structure began to unravel in 3 m urea, despite the dimeric assembly state of the enzyme. At 4 m urea concentration, His6 kinase completely existed as random-coiled monomers. The ability of urea-treated His6 kinase to bind ATP was then analyzed by Affi-Gel Blue resin chromatography. His6kinase was incubated in different concentrations of urea at 23 °C for 1 h. Treatment of the enzyme with up to 2 m urea did not reduce its ability to bind Affi-Gel Blue resin, as indicated by the presence of the enzyme in fractions eluted with 10 mmATP (Fig. 5 A). At 3m urea concentration, however, the kinase lost most of its ability to bind ATP and was present predominantly in the flow-through fractions. In 4 m urea, the kinase was completely unable to bind ATP and was only detected in flow-through fractions. The ability of His6 kinase to bind ATP was also reflected by the degree of autophosphorylation of the enzyme. His6 kinase treated with 2 m or lower concentrations of urea completely retained its capacity in autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). At 3m or higher urea concentration, where His6kinase lost its ability to bind ATP, the enzyme was not autophosphorylated.Figure 5Affi-Gel Blue affinity binding and autophosphorylation of urea-treated His6 kinase. A, Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels of Affi-Gel Blue column fractions. His6 kinase (50 μg/100 μl) was incubated with increasing urea concentrations for 1 h at 23 °C. The urea-treated kinase was applied to the Affi-Gel Blue matrix previously equilibrated with the corresponding urea concentration and incubated for 10 min at 23 °C. The samples were spun in a microcentrifuge, and the resin was washed with the appropriate urea-containing buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with 10 mm Mg-ATP. The eluted and flow-through fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. B, autophosphorylation of urea-treated His6 kinase. The enzyme (100 μg) was incubated with increasing concentrations of urea for 1 h at 23 °C. To the mixture 0.4 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific radioactivity, 0.1 Ci/mmol) was added, and autophosphorylation was allowed to proceed overnight at 4 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by storage phosphor autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The availability of recombinant bovine E2 facilitated studies on the effects of apo and lipoylated E2 on kinase activity. MBP kinase was used in these studies based on its higher solubility than the untagged kinase. Moreover, the presence of the MBP moiety doubled the size of the kinase subunit, allowing the separation of autophosphorylated MBP kinase (Mr = 86,000) subunit from the phosphorylated E1α (Mr = 45, 500) subunit on SDS-PAGE. A fixed concentration of human E1 (12.5 μm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of MBP kinase (0–2 μm) with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of bovine apoE2 or lipoylated E2 (3.3 μm). At the end of incubation, the radiolabel incorporated into E1 or MBP kinase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Fig. 6 A shows that the presence of apoE2 results in 2-fold increase in the rate of32P incorporation into E1α subunit over the MBP kinase alone. Incubation with lipoylated E2 resulted in a 4.3-fold increase compared with the absence of lipoylated E2. The data established that BCKD kinase requires lipoylated E2 for efficient phosphorylation of E1, similar to PDH kinases. The highest 32P incorporation into E1α subunit was obtained at the molar ratio of MBP kinase:E1:lipoylated E2 = 2:12.5:3.3. This stoichiometry was used throughout subsequent kinetic studies with MBP kinase. As shown in Fig.6 B, MBP kinase also catalyzes autophosphorylation in proportion to the enzyme concentration. However, in contrast to phosphotransfer to E1, autophosphorylation of MBP kinase is not affected in the presence of apoE2 or lipoylated E2. The above kinetic studies establish that interactions between E1, E2, and MBP kinase are essential for maximal kinase activity. We next investigated the effects of salt concentrations on these interactions. As suspected, increasing ionic strengths inhibit MBP kinase activity, with a complete loss of kinase activity occurring at 217 mm salt concentration (Fig.7). At this salt concentration, the MBP kinase is dissociated from the E1 and E2, as determined by Ni-NTA extraction and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7, inset). This dissociation disrupts the interaction of MBP kinase with E1 and E2, resulting in the inability of the kinase to phosphorylate E1. As described above, the sequence in the ATP-binding domain is highly conserved between BCKD kinase and bacterial histidine protein kinases (20Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Ahao Y. Shimomura Y.

This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to tetraantennary oligosaccharide and produces pentaantennary oligosaccharide with the β1–4-linked GlcNAc residue on the Manα1–6 arm. It requires a divalent cation such as Mn2+and has an apparent molecular weight of 72,000 under nonreducing conditions.

GnTs I–V have been purified, and the corresponding genes have been cloned (5–19).

By successive column chromatographies using Q-Sepharose FF, Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF, and UDP-hexanolamine-agarose with a newly developed assay method (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) wherein pyridylaminated agalactotetraantennary oligosaccharide ([(2,4),(2,6)]-PA) (see Fig.2) was used as an acceptor substrate and the reaction product was pyridylaminated agalactopentaantennary oligosaccharide ([(2,4),(2,4,6)]-PA) (see Fig. 2), this enzyme was purified 64,000-fold from a homogenate of hen oviduct. Using several acceptor compounds, the purified enzyme was shown to have an absolute requirement of GlcNAcβ1–2(GlcNAcβ1–6)Manα1-R substrate sequence. The GnT VI enzyme is distinct from GnT IV, which generates a β1–4-linked GlcNAc residue only on the Manα1–3 arm (13Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All materials were obtained from the following suppliers: UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-hexanolamine-agarose (ligand concentration of 2.4 μmol/ml), and GlcNAc from Sigma; Q-Sepharose FF and chelating Sepharose FF from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden); Tris, HEPES, MES, and MOPS from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan); Triton X-100, (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, glycine, DTT, and metal chlorides from Wako (Osaka, Japan); [(2, 4),2]-PA from Takara Co. (Kyoto); and hen oviduct from Benchyo (Osaka). GnT VI activity was assayed as described previously (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The standard incubation mixture contained the following components in a total volume of 10 μl: 150 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 100 mm GlcNAc, 30 mmMnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 24 or 120 pmol of substrate ([(2,4),(2,6)]-PA), and 2 μl of enzyme fraction. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, 40 μl of water was added, and the enzyme reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, 10 μl of the supernatant from the reaction mixture was applied to a TSK-Gel ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 75 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Elution was performed at 55 °C with 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 1.6 ml/min. Fluorescence was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. The specific activity of the enzyme is expressed as picomoles of product formed per h/mg of protein. The protein concentration was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce) or a Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The activities of GnTs III–V were measured according to the method of Nishikawa et al.(22Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The structures of all oligosaccharides used in this assay are shown in Fig.2. [(2,4),(2,6)]-PA was prepared from human α1-acid glycoprotein essentially as described previously (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). [2,2]-PA for assay of GnTs III–V was prepared essentially as described previously (22Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). [2,(2,6)]-PA oligosaccharide was prepared from [2,2]-PA by reaction with UDP-GlcNAc, catalyzed by GnT V derived from the culture medium of QG cells (17Gu J. Nishikawa A. Tsuruoka N. Ohno M. Yamaguchi N. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 113: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). All of these structures were confirmed by methylation analysis and mass spectrometry. The buffers used in this study were as follows: Buffer A, 0.25 m sucrose, 20 μm (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); Buffer B, 20% glycerol, 20 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); Buffer C, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4); Buffer D, 20% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); Buffer E, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4); Buffer F, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 0.05 mNaCl, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4); and Buffer G, 20% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4). pH measurements were performed at 4 °C. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Frozen hen oviduct (270 g) was homogenized in a Waring Blendor in Buffer A. After centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was pooled, and the pellet was subjected to two more extractions, after which all the supernatants (1200 ml) were combined. Following centrifugation at 78,000 × g for 2 h, a microsomal fraction of ∼13 g was obtained. The microsomal fraction was suspended in 150 ml of Buffer B, gently stirred for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was collected, and the residual pellet was subjected to another extraction, followed by the same ultracentrifugation. The first and second Triton X-100 extracts were combined and used for further enzyme purification. The Triton X-100 extracts were applied to a column of Q-Sepharose FF (10 × 4 cm) that had been equilibrated with Buffer C. Fractions of 40 ml were collected through this column chromatography. The column was washed with Buffer C until the protein concentration was reduced to 1.0 mg/ml. Elution was then carried out with a linear gradient established between 1000 ml of Buffer C and 1000 ml of 0.8 m NaCl/Buffer C. The fractions containing GnT VI activity were combined. The pool of fractions from Step 3 was applied directly to a column of Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF (2.5 × 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with Buffer D. Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF resin was layered on the chelating Sepharose FF resin without metal ions (2.5 × 5 cm) to avoid any possible leakage of Ni2+. Fractions of 11 ml were collected through this column chromatography. All of the GnT VI activity was retained by the column. After washing the column with Buffer D until the protein concentration was reduced to 0.2 mg/ml, GnT VI activity was eluted with a linear gradient established between 300 ml of Buffer D and 300 ml of 0.1 m glycine/Buffer D. The fractions containing GnT VI activity were combined, and the buffer in this fraction was replaced by Buffer E by means of an Amicon Diaflow Ultrafiltrater using a YM-30 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA). After the above step, the column was siliconized with Sigmacote (Sigma), and siliconized tubes (Assist, Tokyo) were used for fractionation. The UDP-hexanolamine-agarose column (1.5 × 15 cm) had been equilibrated with 0.05 m NaCl/Buffer E, and the concentrated enzyme fraction from Step 4 was applied to the column, followed by washing with 100 ml of Buffer E. GnT VI activity was eluted with Buffer F. At the loading and washing steps, fractions of 5 ml were collected. At the elution step, fractions of 1.4 ml were collected, and those containing GnT VI activity were pooled. An equal volume of Buffer G was added to the pool of fractions from Step 5, and this solution was rechromatographed by the same procedure as described for Step 5. This purified GnT VI fraction was used for the enzyme characterization. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar) using 10% gels. Molecular markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) were used for size standards. Proteins on the gels were stained with a silver staining kit (DAIICHI 2D silver stain II, Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo). The activity of GnT VI was assayed using the fluorescently labeled agalactotetraantennary sugar chain as an acceptor substrate basically according to the original method of Taguchi et al. (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml) was found to be effective in preserving enzyme activity at 37 °C, especially for the highly purified enzyme fraction (Steps 5 and 6), it was routinely included in the standard assay mixture. Like other glycosyltransferases, GnT VI activity was found in the microsomal fraction. At least 80% of the GnT VI activity was associated with the microsomal fraction. GnT VI activity was successfully solubilized from the microsomal fraction by extraction with Triton X-100. Substantial amounts of proteins were separated from GnT VI by Q-Sepharose FF and Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF chromatographies (Fig. 3, A andB). After the Ni2+-chelating Sepharose FF column chromatography (Step 4), the enzyme was more stable than in Steps 2 and 3. As opposed to results with GnTs III and IV (11Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), no GnT VI activity was eluted after application to a Cu2+-chelating column. Following the above two column chromatography steps, the GnT VI active fraction still contained GnT III and β1,4-galactosyltransferase activities. Cation exchange, dye affinity, gel filtration, and lectin column chromatographies did not prove to be effective for further purification of the enzyme fraction after Step 4. The use of an affinity column (Steps 5 and 6) (Fig. 3 C) packed with an analog of the common donor substrate for GnTs (UDP-hexanolamine) as a ligand was effective. This affinity column has been proven to be very effective for purification of GnTs and was first used for the purification of GnT I by Oppenheimer and Hill (5Oppenheimer C.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 799-804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of GnT III was not bound to this column under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The majority of GnT VI activity was bound to this affinity column and was eluted by the buffer lacking MnCl2. Since the eluted fraction (after Step 5) still contained several proteins as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), this fraction was rechromatographed (Step 6) under the same conditions as described for Step 5. The addition of DTT was crucial in preserving GnT VI activity after Steps 5 and 6, whereas it was without effect in Step 4. The enzyme fraction of Step 6 showed a single broad band with a molecular weight of 72,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4) and of 60,000 under reducing conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the enzyme was a glycoprotein. This band was also correlated with GnT VI activity by elution with UDP (5 mm) or NaCl (0.4 m) from a UDP-hexanolamine-agarose column, suggesting that this band was GnT VI (data not shown). No GnT III–V activities were detected in this fraction when [2,2]-PA was used as an acceptor substrate. All experiments for enzyme characterization described below were performed using the chromatographic Step 6 material. TableI summarizes the purification of GnT VI, which was purified 64,000-fold in 16% yield.Figure 4SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of GnT VI.

GnT VI activity was Mn2+-dependent and was high around 5 mm. When the MnCl2 concentration was increased, the activity gradually decreased. The effects of divalent cations on GnT VI activity were examined. The activity was maximal with Mn2+. Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+ could partially substitute for Mn2+, whereas Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, and Cu2+ showed no significant effect (TableII).Table IIEffects of metal ions on GnT VI activityAdditionActivity%MnCl2100CoCl280MgCl260NiCl227CaCl28.5ZnCl2NDFeCl2NDCuCl2NDNoneNDEDTANDEach metal ion (10 mm) was added as the chloride salt.

Purified GnT VI was revealed to select its substrate clearly (TableIII). It could transfer GlcNAc to [(2,4),(2,6)]-PA and [2,(2, 6)]-PA (GnT V product), whereas no activity was observed when [2,2]-PA or [(2,4),2]-PA (GnT IV product) was used as a substrate.Table IIISubstrate specificity of GnT VIAcceptorActivity%[2,2]-PAND[(2,4),2]-PAND[2,(2,6)]-PA340[(2,4),(2,6)]-PA100GnT VI activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” at substrate levels of 12 μm.

Six different GnTs (I–VI) are known to be mainly involved in antenna formation on the cores of N-linked complex-type sugar chains (Fig. 1). In addition, Raju and Stanley (24Raju T.S. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14090-14098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) recently identified two other distinct GnT activities designated GnTs VII and VIII from Chinese hamster ovary mutant cells. GnT VI activity is defined as that catalyzing the transfer of GlcNAc to the Manα1–6 arm and forms a GlcNAcβ1–4Manα1–6 linkage. Only GnT VI has not been purified in the GnTs that act on α-Man residues. The substrate specificity of GnT VI has not been clearly determined, although it has been suggested, by using hen oviduct microsomes as an enzyme source, that GnT VI acts after assembly of GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–3-, GlcNAcβ1–2Manα1–6-, and GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6- antennae by the action of GnTs I, II, and V, respectively (20Brockhausen I.

The tissue distribution of this enzyme seems to be highly restricted. So far, only avian oviduct (20Brockhausen I. Hull E. Hindsgaul O. Schachter H. Shah R.N. Michnick S.W. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11211-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fish ovary (25Taguchi T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Yang J.-M. Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) have been shown to express this enzyme activity. The transferrin synthesized by the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 was reported to have a pentaantennary glycan chain (26Campion B. Léger D. Wieruszeski J.-M. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which is the product of GnT VI activity. In this study, we have purified GnT VI from hen oviduct 64,000-fold with a newly developed assay method (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) wherein [(2,4),(2,6)]-PA (Fig. 2) was used as an acceptor substrate, and the reaction product was [(2,4),(2,4,6)]-PA (Fig. 2). Cloning of this GnT VI gene is now in progress based on the peptide sequences obtained from the purified enzyme. The specificity of this purified GnT VI is summarized as follows (see Table III). (a) no GnT III and IV activities were observed, both of which can act on [2,2]-PA and produce GlcNAcβ1–4 linkages on the β-linked Man residue and the Manα1–3 residue, respectively (11Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M. Kangawa K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18199-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). (b) GnT VI activity was observed when [(2,4),(2,6)]-PA and [2,(2,6)]-PA were used as acceptor substrates. (c) GnT VI activity was not detected when [(2,4),2]-PA was used as a substrate. From these observations, it is concluded that β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminylation to the Manα1–6 arm (GnT V product) is essential for its activity. This defines GnT VI activity as UDP-GlcNAc:GlcNAcβ1–6(GlcNAcβ1–2)Manα1-R [GlcNAc to Man]-β1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. This characteristic clearly distinguishes this enzyme from GnT IV, which is known to generate a β1–4-linked GlcNAc residue only on the Manα1–3 arm (13Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, it should be pointed out that this purified GnT VI does not have GnT VI′ activity, which is defined as that making GlcNAcβ1–2(GlcNAcβ1–4)Manα1–6 linkage without the requirement of a GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6 structure (27Brockhausen I. Möller G. Yang J.-M. Khan S.H. Matta K.L. Paulsen H. Grey A.A. Shah R.N. Schachter H. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 236: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), since no product was detected when [2,2]-PA was used as a substrate. In conjunction with previous observations, the biosynthetic pathways leading to a bisected pentaantennary glycan chain are depicted in Fig. 5. The substrate specificity of purified GnT VI agrees with the results reported by Brockhausen et al. (20Brockhausen I. Hull E. Hindsgaul O. Schachter H. Shah R.N. Michnick S.W. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11211-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a study using hen oviduct microsomes as the enzyme source and GlcNAcβ1–6(GlcNAcβ1–2)Manα1–6Manβ1-(CH2)8COOCH3as an acceptor substrate. Some differences from their results in terms of optimal conditions for activity, e.g. the effect of Mn2+ concentration and the effects of divalent cations, are to be noted. Differences are also noted for the optimal conditions of enzyme from hen oviduct microsomes (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and this purified GnT VI using the same substrate, [(2,4),(2,6)]-PA. Such discrepancies could be due to the presence of another (or other) GnT VI(s) in hen oviduct microsomes. We thank Dr. Harold F.

Multiple subtypes of P2Y receptors have been identified and are distinguished both on a molecular basis and by pharmacologic substrate preference. Functional evidence suggests that hepatocytes from the little skate Raja erinacea express a primitive P2Y ATP receptor lacking pharmacologic selectivity, so we cloned and characterized this receptor. Skate hepatocyte cDNA was amplified with degenerate oligonucleotide probes designed to identify known P2Y subtypes. A single polymerase chain reaction product was found and used to screen a skate liver cDNA library. A 2314-base pair cDNA clone was generated that contained a 1074-base pair open reading frame encoding a 357-amino acid gene product with 61–64% similarity to P2Y1 receptors and 21–37% similarity to other P2Y receptor subtypes. Pharmacology of the putative P2Y receptor was examined using the Xenopus oocyte expression system and revealed activation by a range of nucleotides. The receptor was expressed widely in skate tissue and was expressed to a similar extent in other primitive organisms. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that this receptor is closely related to a common ancestor of the P2Y subtypes found in mammals, avians, and amphibians. Thus, the skate liver P2Y receptor functions as a primitive P2Y ATP receptor with broad pharmacologic selectivity and is related to the evolutionary forerunner of P2Y1 receptors of higher organisms. This novel receptor should provide an effective comparative model for P2Y receptor pharmacology and may improve our understanding of nucleotide specificity among the family of P2Y ATP receptors.

P2Y receptor subtypes are differentiated not only on a molecular level but also by nucleotide specificity (20Nicholas R.A. Lazarowski E.R. Watt W.C. Boyer J. Harden T.K. J. Autonomic Pharmacol. 1996; 16: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indeed, pharmacologic selectivity provides an alternative means to identify P2Y receptor subtypes (21Hwang T.-H. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1611-C1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hepatocytes from the little skate Raja erinacea are primitive polarized secretory epithelia (24Smith D.J. Grossbard M. Gordon E.R. Boyer J.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1987; 241: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Like mammalian hepatocytes (25Boyer J.L. Nathanson M.H. Schiffer S.M. Maddrey W.C. Schiff's Diseases of the Liver. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1999: 119-146Google Scholar), skate hepatocytes express P2Y receptors that link to Ca2+ signaling and secretion (26Nathanson M.H. Mariwalla K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R561-R570PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nathanson M.H. O'Neill A.F. Burgstahler A.D. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3049-3056PubMed Google Scholar). However, skate hepatocytes respond to a variety of nucleotide stimuli (26Nathanson M.H. Mariwalla K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R561-R570PubMed Google Scholar), so we identified the P2Y receptor expressed by these cells. Male skates (R. erinacea, 0.7–1.2 kg), female sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis), female blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), male dogfish sharks (Squalus acanthias), and male flounders (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) were caught by net in Frenchmen's Bay, Maine, during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Marine organisms were maintained in large tanks with flowing 15 °C seawater at Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (Salisbury Cove, ME) for up to 4 days before use. ATP, ADP, ATPγS,1 UTP, and UDP were purchased from Sigma. 2-Methylthioadenosine triphosphate (2MeSATP) was purchased from Research Biochemical (Natick, MA). Fluo-3 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Pitchford, OR). All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. Skate liver was freshly excised under RNase-free conditions, minced, and homogenized. Total RNA was prepared using an organic-chaotropic reagent (RNAwiz; Ambion, Austin, TX) and then treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 15 min, extracted in phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), serially precipitated in isopropanol and 70% ethanol (v/v), and redissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-containing water. cDNA was prepared from total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and dT18 primers (Advantage cDNA Polymerase; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA).

Commun. 1995; 211: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)) were used for cDNA PCR under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 5 min (Advantage cDNA Polymerase; CLONTECH). Products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and purified (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A custom skate liver λ bacteriophage library was prepared (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plaques were titered, plated, and lifted onto charged nylon membranes. A 32P-labeled probe was prepared from the sequenced PCR product using random labeling at room temperature for 4 h (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Membranes were screened with the radiolabeled probe and washed according to manufacturer instructions (Quik-Hyb; Stratagene). One positive clone was identified from 1,200,000 plaques. The clone was excised, dissolved in chloroform, and replated for secondary screening. Positive clones were identified in secondary screening plates as described above and isolated using an in vivo excision protocol. A positive clone was analyzed using PCR and fully sequenced in both directions using an automated sequencer by primer walking. Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences were analyzed using Lasergene software (DNAStar, Madison, WI), BLAST search (NCBI Protein Database), and Prosite. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Clustal method (29Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic behavior of the putative receptor was determined by expressing the cloned gene product in Xenopus laevis oocytes (15Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F.

Neuroscience. 1996; 74: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Capped skate liver P2Y cRNA was prepared using T3 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (MAXIscript; Ambion). Xenopus oocytes were isolated and defolliculated in collagenase for approximately 90 min, because only defolliculated oocytes lack endogenous P2Y receptors (32Bogdanov Y.D. Dale L. King B.F. Whittock N. Burnstock G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12583-12590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The oocytes were injected with putative skate liver P2Y cRNA or water 2–3 days before use and then injected with the Ca2+-sensitive dye fluo-3 (1 mm; 40 nl/cell) 30–60 min before use. Oocytes were transferred to a specially designed chamber then examined by time lapse confocal microscopy (30Nathanson M.H. Moyer M.S. Burgstahler A.D. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23282-23289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were excited at 488 nm, and wavelengths of >515 nm were collected. A Bio-Rad MRC 1024 or Olympus Fluoview confocal imaging system was used to collect serial images as oocytes were perifused with ATP, 2MeSATP, ADP, UTP, UDP, or ATPγS. Responses to each nucleotide always were compared with responses to ATP from the same group of oocytes, to account for variability among different oocyte preparations. cDNA PCR of skate liver was performed under the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min; 16–30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 5 min (Advantage cDNA Polymerase; CLONTECH) with skate P2Y-specific primers (5′-GAAGTCGCTGGGCAGGCTGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-ACGTGGCGTAAACCCTTCGGTTCC-3′). PCR amplification was found to be exponential for 16–22 cycles under these conditions. Negative control reactions were performed on RNA unexposed to reverse transcriptase (RNA controls), water, HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cell cDNA, and human brain cDNA. Total RNA was prepared from skate liver, common bile duct, duodenum, rectal gland, gill, brain, heart, and spleen, and then DNase treatment and cDNA synthesis were performed as described above. Tissue cDNAs underwent PCR for 20 cycles, were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h, hybridized at 68 °C for 2 h with a radiolabeled probe prepared as described under “Molecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis,” and then washed according to manufacturer instructions (QuikHyb; Stratagene). X-ray films were placed atop the membrane at −80 °C for 24 h and developed (33Zheng H. Yan W. Toppari J. Harkonen P. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A laser densitometer (Personal Densitometer SI; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA) was used to quantitate hybridization products. Genomic DNA was prepared from sea urchin, blue crab, skate, dogfish shark, flounder, and frog according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Genomic DNA from chicken, rat, mouse, and human was purchased (CLONTECH). Lyophilized aliquots of DNA (25 μg) were reconstituted in 3 μl of water and then loaded onto a charged nylon membrane. The membrane was prehybridized at 68 °C for 1 h, hybridized at 68 °C for 2 h with a radiolabeled probe prepared as described under “Molecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis,” and then washed according to manufacturer instructions (QuikHyb; Stratagene). Identically prepared membranes were hybridized to a radiolabeled human glucose 3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe (CLONTECH) under the same conditions. X-ray films were placed atop the membrane at −80 °C for 24 h and developed. A laser densitometer (Personal Densitometer SI; Molecular Dynamics, Sunnydale, CA) was used to quantitate hybridization products. To examine whether homologues of cloned mammalian P2Y receptors could be identified in skate liver, skate hepatocyte RNA was screened by RT-PCR using two separate but overlapping degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify sequences conserved among all known P2Y receptors (10Tokuyama Y. Hara M. Jones E.M.C. Fan Z. Bell G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Chen Z.-P. Krull N. Xu S. Levy A. Lightman S.L. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1833-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Only a single 500–600-base pair PCR product was identified with either primer set, whereas no product was identified in water or RNA controls (Fig. 1). Sequences of both products contained an overlapping and identical segment and shared 50–60% identity to P2Y1 receptors of avians and mammals and 30–40% identity to other cloned P2Y receptors. The shorter PCR product was used to screen a skate liver bacteriophage cDNA library and produced a single hybridizing plaque. The plaque was excised, analyzed by gel electrophoresis, and sequenced fully in both directions. This clone (GenBankTM accession numberAF242850) was 2314 base pairs in length and contained a 1074-base pair open reading frame, encoding a predicted protein sequence of 357 amino acids (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis of this clone revealed 61–64% identity to avian and mammalian P2Y1 receptors, 22–34% identity to avian and mammalian P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, and P2Y11 receptors, and 37% identity to the frog P2Y8 receptor at the amino acid level (TableI). The deduced amino acid sequence contained seven predicted transmembrane helical domains, with an extracellular N terminus and intracellular C-terminal tail. Other motifs present included a G protein-coupled receptor signature motif, four protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, two cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, four casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, five N-glycosylation sites, and four N-myristoylation sites. A computer-generated phylogenetic analysis (DNAStar) suggested that the skate P2Y receptor is most closely related to P2Y receptors of the P2Y1subtype (Fig. 3 A) and emerged early in evolution from a common ancestor to P2Y1 receptors of higher organisms (Fig. 3 B).Figure 2Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the skate liver P2Y receptor. The skate liver P2Y gene contains 2314 base pairs (A) with a 1074-base pair open reading frame (bold type) and encodes a predicted 357 base pair amino acid sequence (B) with seven predicted transmembrane helical domains and a G protein-coupled receptor signature motif. The skate liver P2Y amino acid sequence is shown aligned with human P2Y1 and P2Y2. Residues indicated by white letters on a black background are conserved among all three sequences, and boxed letters indicate residues conserved between any two sequences.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IPercentage of nucleotide similarity between the putative skate liver P2Y receptor and cloned P2Y subtypesHuman P2Y1Human P2Y2Chicken P2Y3Human P2Y4Human P2Y6Frog P2V8Human P2Y11Skate liver P2Y61.234.133.232.132.336.921.5Human P2Y130.032.633.430.535.924.7Human P2Y237.550.736.643.521.3Chicken P2Y336.060.734.118.3Human P2Y436.350.424.4Human P2Y636.022.3Frog P2Y822.1 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Phylogenetic analysis of cloned P2Y receptors.

The oocytes then were injected with the Ca2+-sensitive dye fluo-3 and then serially monitored using time lapse confocal microscopy to detect nucleotide-induced increases [Ca2+] i . Extracellular ATP (1 μm -100 μm) increased [Ca2+] i in cRNA-injected but not water-injected oocytes (Fig. 4). Increases in [Ca2+] i also were seen in cRNA-injected oocytes perifused with ATP in Ca2+-free medium. These findings demonstrate that the putative skate liver P2Y receptor functions as a P2Y ATP receptor. To determine the nucleotide specificity of this receptor, oocytes also were examined during perifusion with ADP, 2-MeSATP, UTP, UDP, and ATPγS. Perifusion with 100 μm concentrations of ATP, ADP, 2-MeSATP, UTP, UDP, and ATPγS each induced a single intense [Ca2+] i wave that crossed the oocyte (Fig. 4,A and B, and TableII). Stimulation with lower concentrations (1–10 μm) of ATP or 2-MeSATP induced slower and less intense Ca2+ waves, some of which exhibited oscillatory features (Fig. 4 C). This dose-dependent change in [Ca2+] i signaling is typical in Xenopus oocytes expressing exogenous G protein-coupled receptors (30Nathanson M.H. Moyer M.S. Burgstahler A.D. O'Carroll A.M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23282-23289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings thus demonstrate that, unlike previously identified P2Y receptors, this P2Y receptor is activated by a broad range of nucleotide ligands.Table IIBroad nucleotide specificity of the cloned skate liver P2Y receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytesNucleotide concentrationATP2-MeSATPADPUTPUDPATPγSATP (Ca2+-free)μmcRNA-injected oocytes 10024 /324 /48 /94 /44 /44 /43 /5 102 /45 /5 12 /65 /7H2O-injected oocytes 1000 /70 /30 /30 /30 /3To account for variability among cRNA-injected oocytes, nucleotide-induced Ca2+ increases were compared to ATP-induced increases typical of those seen in Figure 4.

A variety of agonists, including ADP (P2Y1 agonist), 2-MeSATP (P2Y1), UTP (P2Y2 and P2Y4), UDP (P2Y6), and ATPγS (nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue) induced Ca2+ increases in Xenopus oocytes expressing the cloned skate liver P2Y receptor, whereas adenosine and uridine did not.

To investigate the relative organ distribution of the skate liver P2Y receptor, semi-quantitative multiple tissue RT-PCR was performed. This technique was chosen because P2Y receptors frequently are found at concentrations in which they can be detected by RT-PCR but not by Northern blot (19Webb T.E. Henderson D.J. Roberts J.A. Barnard E.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1348-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Skate P2Y receptor message was detected in all tissues examined (liver, common bile duct, duodenum, rectal gland, gill, brain, heart, spleen, and testis) but not in RNA controls, water controls, HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells, or human brain (Fig.5 A). Strongest expression was seen in duodenum, spleen, rectal gland, brain, and liver (Fig.5 B), whereas expression in other organs was considerably lower. This demonstrates that this P2Y receptor is not a liver-specific gene but rather is expressed throughout in the skate to varying degrees. To assess whether other members of the animal kingdom express homologues of the skate liver P2Y receptor, genomic DNAs of representative species were examined by dot blot (Fig.6 A). Strong hybridization was seen to crab, skate, shark, and flounder, whereas weak hybridization was seen to other species (Fig. 6 B). This suggests that similar genes are expressed throughout the animal kingdom with more closely related genes found in marine species. P2Y receptors are expressed widely in higher organisms. Humans and rodents each express at least four P2Y receptor subtypes (8Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar). Although some tissues express only one or two P2Y subtypes at either the apical or basolateral plasma membrane (1Fabre J.E. Nguyen M. Latour A. Keifer J.A. Audoly L.P. Coffman T.M. Koller B.H. Nat.

This highlights the complex organization of purinergic signaling in higher organisms. In contrast to this complex expression of P2Y receptors in higher organisms, the current findings suggest that the primitive chordate R. erinacea expresses just a single P2Y receptor. The skate liver P2Y receptor has likely evolved within the subfamily of P2Y1 receptors yet is molecularly distinct from either avian or mammalian P2Y1 subtypes. Because this receptor is activated by a variety of diphosphate and triphosphate nucleotides, its pharmacologic specificity may be less developed than P2Y receptors of higher organisms. Furthermore, other receptors that link to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and [Ca2+] i signaling are not detectable in skate liver (26Nathanson M.H. Mariwalla K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R561-R570PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleotide receptors are among the most primitive extracellular receptors expressed in the animal kingdom. Moreover, the skate liver P2Y receptor is distributed throughout the skate, so purinergic signaling may be controlled similarly in all skate tissues. Despite its widespread tissue distribution and primitive pharmacology, this P2Y receptor regulates bile secretion in liver (26Nathanson M.H. Mariwalla K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R561-R570PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this simple extracellular receptor is linked to specific physiologic responses. The primitive nature of the skate liver P2Y receptor is highlighted by the finding that it is related to similar molecules in even more primitive organisms. Strong hybridization was seen with blue crab, indicating that a P2Y receptor is likely expressed in this invertebrate. Weak hybridization was seen with sea urchin, suggesting that a P2Y receptor may be expressed in this primitive invertebrate as well. Because the skate liver P2Y receptor is most closely related to the P2Y1 subfamily, it is likely that the common ancestor of P2Y receptors arose in a simpler invertebrate such as the sea urchin rather than in an early chordate such as the skate. It has been suggested that nucleotides may have arisen as signaling molecules early in evolution because they were already plentiful as intracellular energy sources (9Burnstock G. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). A related hypothesis is that the initial efflux of nucleotides occurred as cells were injured or dying, and evolution of early P2Y receptors allowed neighboring cells to become aware of cell injury or death. Thus, in addition to being among the most primitive signaling mechanisms, purinergic signaling may be among the oldest signaling mechanisms. What advantage could be conferred by the evolution of single P2Y receptors with less selective pharmacology and widespread tissue distribution to the complex expression of multiple P2Y receptors with highly selective pharmacology and tissue distributions? One explanation is that P2Y receptor subtypes evolved in higher organisms to allow tissue-specific responses to release of particular nucleotides. The recent finding that some P2Y receptors may have distinct signal transduction mechanisms (18Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) suggests there may be even further fine tuning of responses through cross-talk between second messenger pathways. Further identification and characterization of P2Y receptors from organisms that evolved after the skate but before mammals and birds may help to address this important question.

Although they do not show a great deal of sequence homology, the common mechanism of catalysis is shown by the conservation of five residues that bring about cleavage and rejoining of specific phosphodiester bonds in the target DNA (5Craig N.L.

One of these conserved amino acids is an absolutely conserved tyrosine that carries out DNA strand cleavage. Hence, this family is also called the tyrosine family of recombinases. The tyrosine residue attaches the protein covalently to the 3′-phosphoryl end at the site of the break, thus conserving the energy of the phosphodiester bond in the phosphotyrosine linkage. The Cre recombinase is one of the members of the integrase family of site-specific recombinases. Cre is encoded by bacteriophage P1, and its function is to facilitate segregation of the low copy P1 prophage by resolving dimeric plasmids that are formed by homologous recombination (12Austin S. Ziese M. Sternberg N. Cell. 1981; 25: 729-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The solution of several cocrystal structures of Cre bound to its target sequence, the lox site (see Fig. 1), has given new insights into the details of the various steps of the reaction (13Gopaul D.N. Guo F. Van Duyne G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4175-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 14Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Van Duyne G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7143-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The Cre monomer consists of a bidomainal, largely helical structure that binds to two faces of the lox site in a clamp-like fashion. Two lox sites are assembled in an anti-parallel fashion by four monomers of Cre to form a synaptic structure. The two sites are arranged in a square-planar structure in which the arms of each site are bent to between 70° and 110°. The kink in the lox site is placed asymmetrically toward one end of the spacer region. The asymmetric position of the bend is thought to regulate strand cleavage that takes place at the cleavage site 5 bp1 removed from the bend. The synapse is stabilized by a series of cyclic interactions between the four monomers. Two Cre molecules are bound to each loxsite. One of these Cre molecules (the cleaving monomer) is in an active state to cleave the scissile phosphate bond, whereas the other molecule is in the inactive state (the non-cleaving monomer). Three “cross-core” interactions occur between two Cre monomers bound to the same lox site. These consist of 1) an NH2-terminal interface between the E helix of the cleaving monomer with the A helix of the non-cleaving monomer, 2) a COOH-terminal interaction that involves the burying of the N helix of the cleaving monomer in a hydrophobic pocket of the non-cleaving monomer, and 3) the contact of the β2 and β3 strands and K201 of the non-cleaving monomer with the E helix of the cleaving monomer. Two “synaptic” interactions occur between Cre monomers bound to two different lox sites: 1) The E helix of a non-cleaving monomer interacts with the A helix of a cleaving monomer, and 2) the N helix of a non-cleaving monomer is buried in a COOH-terminal hydrophobic pocket of a cleaving monomer. The induction of the asymmetric bend is thought to be due to these protein-protein interactions, although Gly-314 contacts the backbone at the kink through a water molecule. Wierzbicki et al. (17Wierzbicki A. Kendall M. Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have previously isolated two mutations (A36V, T41F) encoding mutant Cre proteins that were recombination-defective. The A36V protein failed to form α-intermediates and was therefore thought to have a defect in synapsis (18Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure & Methods. Vol. 1: Human Genome Initiative & DNA Recombination. Adenine Press, New York1990: 203-213Google Scholar). To gain further understanding of the mechanisms of synapsis and bending by Cre, we studied the Cre A36V and T41F proteins as well as another protein, A312T (17Wierzbicki A. Kendall M. Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is recombination-competent but accumulates α-intermediates (19Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We also created a G314R mutation in Cre. This glycine residue is highly conserved in all integrase family members (4Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar); the same mutation in the Flp recombinase causes a severe bending defect (20Schwartz C.J. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We performed in vitro complementation studies on the A36V, T41F, and G314R mutant proteins and found that they all show defects in cleavage. Their cleavage defects can be corrected by provision of a cleavage-defective, bending-competent Cre protein. We postulate that these three proteins may be defective in DNA bending. We discuss the relationship among DNA bending, synapsis, and strand cleavage in the Cre reaction. All enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs (unless otherwise stated) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The pShe1, pShe5, pShe6, pShe20, pShe21, and pRH43 plasmids have been described previously (21Shaikh A.C. The Cleavage Mode of the Cre Recombinase. Ph.D. thesis.

All plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen plasmid isolation kit. Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Hospital for Sick Children/Pharmacia Biotechnology Service Center at the Banting Institute, University of Toronto. They were cartridge-purified. Where needed, the oligonucleotides were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (24Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They were then annealed to the appropriate complementary oligonucleotide by heating and slow cooling in 0.1 m NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Native Cre protein was purified from an induced culture of pShe11 and Cre25 from an induced culture of pShe5. His-tagged Fre was purified from an induced culture of pShe20. Purification conditions for all proteins have been described previously (21Shaikh A.C. The Cleavage Mode of the Cre Recombinase. Ph.D. thesis. University of Toronto, 2000Google Scholar, 22Shaikh A.C.

A common strategy was used to introduce mutations into the Cre gene contained in the His-Cre expression plasmid pShe6. Briefly, a PCR primer was designed to introduce the desired mutation and used together with another primer to amplify a DNA fragment. This PCR1 product was then used as a primer together with a second primer in another PCR reaction to amplify a second PCR product. The pShe6 vector and the PCR2 products were cut with the appropriate restriction enzymes (NdeI and XhoI), and the fragments were purified and ligated together to give the appropriate mutationally altered construct containing the variant Cregene in-frame with a 10× His-tag leader sequence. To obtain non-His-tagged variant Cre expression vectors, the pShe11 vector and the PCR2 products were similarly combined together. DNA sequencing of the entire Cre gene confirmed the mutation.

Open table in a new tab We designed a DNA substrate with which we could monitor by native PAGE the excision of the DNA segment between two directly oriented lox sites. A similar substrate was used to analyze α structures generated by Cre (19Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The pRH43 plasmid (25Abremski K. Hoess R. Sternberg N. Cell. 1983; 32: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) has two directly oriented loxsites separated by 1.6 kilobase pairs of DNA. We treated the plasmid with HindIII and BamHI enzymes to remove this intervening region and replaced it with the 309-bp HindIII-BamHI fragment from pET19b (Novagen) to give the plasmid pReconI. We further shortened the DNA between the two loxsites by first treating the pReconI with BamHI and filling in the recessed ends with Klenow enzyme. We then digested the plasmid with EcoRV, isolated the large vector fragment, and religated the ends to give pReconII. The pReconII plasmid contains two directly oriented lox sites separated by 186 bp (see Fig.1 d). Gel mobility shift assays were used to test the ability of Cre (or His-Cre), Cre25, and the Cre variant proteins to bind to the suicide lox site shown in Fig. 1 b as described previously (17Wierzbicki A. Kendall M. Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol.

Cleavage and covalent attachment of the suicide substrate were analyzed on a 15% SDS polyacrylamide gel (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar) as described previously (24Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We isolated the 285-bp EcoRI-XhoI DNA fragment from the pReconII vector and labeled the 3′-DNA ends with [α-32P]cordycepin triphosphate (NEN Life Science Products) using terminal transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.). We purified the labeled substrate from unincorporated nucleotides using P6 spin columns (Bio-Rad). Binding assays were done with His-tagged versions of Cre, and the Cre variants as described above except 6.5% native polyacrylamide gels were used and the gel was run for 14 h at 200 V. The complexV (cV) was isolated after incubation of DNA with His-Cre or His-Cre A312T on ice for 1 min, after which the sample was immediately run on the gel at 4 °C. We exposed the wet gel to x-ray film for 4 h at 4 °C and isolated the complexes from the gel by the “crush and soak” method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We then digested the DNA with HindIII. After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the samples were resuspended in sequencing dye (80% formamide, 10 mmNaOH, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% of xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue dyes) and analyzed on an 8% urea-denaturing gel. Previously, Wierzbicki et al. (19Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) described variant Cre proteins with alterations at positions 36, 41, and 312 (17Wierzbicki A. Kendall M. Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Cre A312T variant accumulates Holliday intermediates in the recombination reaction. In fact, analysis of such intermediates led to the conclusion that Cre initiates recombination on the bottom strand of the lox site (Fig.1 a). In contrast, two Cre variants, Cre A36V and Cre T41F are recombination-defective. These Cre proteins bind to the lox site, but fail to generate higher order complexes indicative of synapsis (17Wierzbicki A. Kendall M. Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, Cre A36V and Cre T41F can resolve the α structures generated by Cre A312T and synthetic Holliday intermediates as well (Ref. 19Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and data not shown). A glycine residue at position 314 in Cre is highly conserved among most of the integrases (4Nunes-Duby S.E. Kwon H.J. Tirumalai R.S. Ellenberger T. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 391-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The Flp variant, Flp G328R, has a change in the corresponding residue. This protein is both recombination- and cleavage-defective (20Schwartz C.J. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Dixon J.E. Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but can donate its tyrosine in trans to another cleavage-defective Flp variant, Flp Y343F. The Flp G328R protein shows a severe defect in bending of the FRT site. We have constructed the Cre G314R variant and found that it is also defective for recombination activity (data not shown). In an effort to learn more about Cre-mediated cleavage, synapsis, and DNA bending, we have characterized further the in vitro phenotypes of these Cre variants. Although the Hoess group reported that the A36V and Cre T41F proteins were catalytically active in the resolution of Holliday intermediates (19Hoess R. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6840-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), they did not assay these proteins directly for cleavage activity. We therefore designed the suicide lox site, s loxT (Fig. 1 b) to test the four Cre variants for binding and cleavage activity. Cre-mediated cleavage at the top strand cleavage site results in covalent attachment of the Cre protein to the 3′-end of the scissile phosphate and liberates a dTG dinucleotide preventing religation and trapping the covalent complex. The covalent complex can be detected by SDS-PAGE. The various Cre proteins were incubated with the s loxT substrate, and we found that, although Cre cleaved robustly (Fig.2, lanes 2 and 3), the recombination-defective Cre variants Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre G314R were all severely defective in cleavage activity (Fig. 2,lanes 4–7 and 10–11). His-tagged versions of Cre A36V and Cre T41F were also cleavage-defective (data not shown). Consistent with previous results, the tyrosine-deficient Cre Y324C variant and the Cre COOH-terminal peptide Cre25 also showed no cleavage activity (Fig. 2, lanes 8, 9, 14, and 15) (18Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure & Methods. Vol. 1: Human Genome Initiative & DNA Recombination. Adenine Press, New York1990: 203-213Google Scholar, 22Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30Hoess R. Abremski K. Irwin S. Kendall M. Mack A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, consistent with previous results, Cre25 bound the s loxT site with 10-fold reduced affinity compared with the full-length Cre proteins (23Shaikh A.C. Assays of the Functional Domains of Cre and Flp Recombinases. M.Sc. thesis. University of Toronto, 1997Google Scholar, 30Hoess R. Abremski K. Irwin S. Kendall M. Mack A. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The only Cre variant that showed any cleavage activity was Cre A312T (Fig. 2,lanes 12 and 13). Note that the presence of the His-tag on Cre A312T slows the mobility of the covalent complex (covHCre) compared with the covalent complex generated by non-His-tagged Cre (covCre). By PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) quantitation, Cre A312T was one-third as efficient in cleaving the s loxT substrate as wild-type Cre (data not shown). We have also tested a suicide lox site that assays cleavage at the bottom strand of the lox site and found that the cleavage activities of Cre, Cre A36V, Cre T41F, Cre G314R, Cre Y324C, and Cre25 at the bottom cleavage site were identical to those observed on the top strand cleavage site (data not shown). Interestingly, Cre A312T cleaved the bottom strand as well as wild-type Cre (data not shown). The decreased ability of Cre A312T to cleave the top strand scissile phosphate may explain the accumulation of Holliday intermediates by this Cre variant. Cre A312T should be able to form the Holliday intermediate efficiently by exchanging the bottom strands, but the intermediates would accumulate due to inefficient cleavage at the top strands. The absence of cleavage activity by Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre G314R could not be explained by a reduced affinity for the target site, because all the Cre proteins generated similar levels of monomeric (cI) and dimeric (cII) complexes (Fig. 3). However, neither the cleavage-defective Cre variants nor the Cre25 peptide formed higher order complexes (HO, Fig. 3,lanes 4–11 and 14). The catalytically active Cre and Cre A312T proteins did generate these higher order complexes with wild-type Cre forming about three times as much higher order complex as Cre A312T (by PhosphorImager quantitation, data not shown). Because these higher order complexes are believed to result from synaptic interactions between two recombination sites containing two Cre molecules (15Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 18Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure & Methods. Vol. 1: Human Genome Initiative & DNA Recombination. Adenine Press, New York1990: 203-213Google Scholar, 22Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), their absence confirms the synapsis defect of the Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre25 proteins (18Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure & Methods. Vol. 1: Human Genome Initiative & DNA Recombination. Adenine Press, New York1990: 203-213Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cre G314R and Cre Y324C are also defective in synapsis. To gain insight into the mechanism of cleavage and synapsis, we tested whether the Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre G314R proteins could be complemented for cleavage activity by another cleavage-defective Cre protein. Cre Y324C lacks the catalytic tyrosine residue but can activate a scissile phosphodiester bond for trans cleavage by a tyrosine donated from a complementing Cre molecule (22Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5695-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Such complementation would require the Cre Y324C protein to establish protein-protein interactions with the Cre A36V, Cre T41F, or Cre G314R proteins. We therefore combined each of the three Cre variants with Cre Y324C and assayed covalent attachment to the s loxT substrate by SDS-PAGE analysis. Cre Y324C dramatically stimulated the cleavage by Cre A36V and Cre T41F variants (Fig. 4 a,cf. lanes 6–8 with 9–11, and cf. lanes 12–14 with 15–17). Note that the covalent complexes have an electrophoretic mobility of a non-His-tagged protein (covCre) and were therefore not due to the activation of a latent nucleophile in the His-tagged Cre Y324C protein. Although these experiments were not designed to address the position of the cleaving monomer (i.e. Cre A36V or Cre T41F) within a protein-DNA complex, the crystal structure and recent in vitro studies showed cis-cleavage by Cre (15Guo F. Gopaul D.N. Van Duyne G.D. Nature. 1997; 389: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 24Shaikh A.C. Sadowski P.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This would suggest that Cre A36V and Cre T41F were bound adjacent to the top strand scissile phosphate and exhibit cleaving in cis. The level of stimulation of Cre A36V and Cre T41F cleavage increased as greater amounts of Cre Y324C protein were added (Fig. 4 a,lanes 9–11 and 15–17). By PhosphorImager quantitation, the maximum levels of Cre Y324C-dependent stimulation of Cre A36V and Cre T41F cleavage activity were 6- and 4-fold (data not shown). We also observed similar levels of stimulation of His-tagged Cre A36V and His-tagged Cre T41F cleavage activity that was dependent on addition of Cre Y324C (data not shown). Cre Y324C also stimulated cleavage by Cre G314R to a maximum of 6-fold (Fig. 4 b, cf. lanes 6–8 with 9–11). Although both proteins in these mixed reactions are His-tagged, the inactivity of His-Cre Y324C by itself suggests that the His-Cre covalent complex (covHCre) was mediated via the tyrosine of His-Cre G314R. The Cre25 peptide did not stimulate the cleavage activity of either Cre A36V or Cre T41F and very weakly (1.2-fold) stimulated Cre G314R activity (data not shown). Cre Y324C could have stimulated cleavage activity of Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre G314R by enhancing their binding to the s loxT substrate. To exclude this possibility, we examined the binding profile of the mixed reaction using gel mobility shift analysis. We found that addition of the Cre Y324C protein did not affect the binding of Cre A36V to the lox site (Fig. 5), and interestingly, the mixed reaction generated a heterodimeric complex (cII·Mix) that was consistent with the binding of one monomer of Cre A36V and one monomer of His-Cre Y324C to the same substrate molecule (Fig. 5, lanes 8–10). Furthermore, this mixed dimeric complex was favored over the homodimeric complexes generated by both Cre A36V (cII·Cre) and His-Cre Y324C (cII·HCre). This is most obvious in Fig. 5, lane 9, where equal amounts of each protein were added (cf. lanes 3, 6, and 9). Similar results were also obtained using the Cre T41F protein in the mixed reaction (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the assembly of the mixed dimeric complex containing Cre Y324C and either Cre A36V, Cre T41F, or Cre G314R accounts for the stimulation of Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre G314R cleavage activities. Because the Cre A36V, Cre T41F, and Cre G314R proteins fail to generate higher order complexes, they have putative defects in synapsis (17Wierzbicki A. Kendall M. Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol.

We wished to test whether complementation by Cre Y324C, which also fails to generate higher order complexes (see Fig.2), could form a synapse with either Cre A36V, Cre T41F, or Cre G314R proteins. The binding profile of the mixed reaction (see Fig. 5) did not show any higher order complexes indicative of synapsis. However, this assay may not be sensitive enough to detect the intermolecular association of two mixed dimeric complexes. The intermolecular association of two lox sites may be less efficient or the synaptic complex less stable than with wild-type Cre. Previously, Hoess et al. (18Hoess R.H. Wierzbicki A. Abremski K.

We constructed an analogous substrate (the Recon II substrate, Fig.1 e) to monitor protein-protein interactions between two directly oriented lox sites on the same DNA molecule. Cre can rearrange the 286-bp Recon II substrate into a synaptic complex in which the two lox sites are in aligned. 2The analogous product detected previously by Hoess et al. (18Hoess R.H.

Depending on the environmental conditions, the cell uses different membrane bound structures to sequester the Cvt complex and deliver pAPI to the vacuole. It has been proposed that, during vegetative growth, the Cvt complex is selectively wrapped by a double membrane sac (10Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) or translocated to a prevacuolar compartment (5Seguı́-Real B. Martı́nez M. Sandoval I.V.

While searching for proteins interacting with the prepro-NH2 extension of pAPI, the segment that mediates the transport of the protein precursor to the vacuole (5Seguı́-Real B. Martı́nez M.

To study the role of Ssa1p in the targeting of pAPI to the vacuole, we analyzed this process in a mutant strain carrying a temperature-sensitive allele ofSSA1 and inactivated alleles of the SSA2,SSA3, and SSA4 genes. We show here that targeting of the pAPI to the vacuole is mediated by Ssa1p under both growing and nitrogen starvation conditions. To generate the yeast strains used in this work we introduced mutations in each of the four SSAgenes in the W303-1b genetic background. Gene disruptions ofSSA2, SSA3, and SSA4 were performed by the short flanking homology technique (15Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar).ssa2::LEU2 and ssa3::TRP1 disruption cassettes were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA of strain a1-45 (12Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) as template. SSA4 was replaced by the dominant-resistant module KanMX, which confers resistance to Geneticin (16Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). The PCR fragments contained in their 3′ and 5′ ends a minimum of 45 base pairs homologous to the flanking regions of the target gene, thus allowing for homologous recombination at their genomic loci. Disruption cassettes were consecutively transformed into W303-1b cells (17Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), and disruption of each gene was verified by analytical PCR using specific oligonucleotides for the 5′ and 3′ regions of the corresponding gene. The resultant strain, deleted forSSA2, SSA3, and SSA4, was named ESY170 (see Table I). To obtain strain ESY216 (ssa1 ts ssa2ssa3ssa4) a 1.7-kilobase pair KpnI-SphI fragment of thessa1 temperature-sensitive allele in strain a1-45, containing mutation Pro417 to Leu (12Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), was amplified and cloned in the integrative vector pRS306 (URA3) (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), digested at the unique ClaI site internal to the cloned fragment, and transformed into strain ESY170. Transformants being both Ura+- and temperature-sensitive for growth were counterselected in fluorotic acid-containing plates and analyzed again for temperature sensitivity. Correct integration and presence of the Pro417 → Leu mutation were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Strain ESY228 was constructed by disrupting theAPI gene using the HIS3 marker as described previously (5Seguı́-Real B. Martı́nez M. Sandoval I.V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5476-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ESY228 was used to overexpress the API gene carried in a 2-μ plasmid under the control of the GAL1–10 promoter (5Seguı́-Real B.

Synthetic minimal medium containing 2% glucose and 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (SD-N) was used for nitrogen starvation experiments. Standard techniques for yeast strain propagation and genetic manipulation were used as described (19Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laoratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed by the method of Ito et al. (20Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA manipulations as described (21Sambrook J.E. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 60 ml of SD medium containing the appropriate requirements were inoculated with W303-1b cells and grown overnight at 30 °C. Cells were harvested in the logarithmic phase by centrifugation, resuspended in 2 ml of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate prepared to 0.17%, 0.4% NH4Cl, 0.3% glucose, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and labeled for 1 h at 30 °C with 1 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (specific activity > 1000 Ci/ml; Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were then washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.15m NaCl (PNC buffer), disrupted with glass beads in 1 ml of the same buffer, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added to 1 mm, and cell debris removed by centrifugation two times for 10 min at 2000 × g. The resulting extract was centrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 × g in a TL100.3 rotor (Beckman) and the supernatant (S150) made 2% in Triton X-100, whereas the pellet (P150) was resuspended in 1 ml of PNC buffer, 2% Triton X-100 incubated for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 30 min at 150,000 × g. The 43-amino acid-long MEEQREILEQLKKTLQMLTVEPSKNNQIANEEKEKKENENSWC-COOH and MEEQREGLEQLKKTLQMLTVEPSKNNQIANEEKEKKENENSWC-COOH peptides from the prepro-NH2 extension of the pAPI (prepro-peptide) were coupled to agarose (Sulfolink) (Pierce) at a ratio of 5 mg/ml gel, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). The S150 and P150 fractions were mixed with 1 volume of PNC buffer and incubated overnight with the prepro-peptide conjugated to agarose (Sulfolink). The resin was then washed three times for 15 min with PNC buffer, 0.5% Triton X-100, once for 15 min with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and then quickly with water. Aliquots from the yeast crude extract, the S150 and P150 fractions, the fourth wash, and the washed resin were boiled in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-12% PAGE, and the electrophoretograms analyzed for protein both by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. The 70-kDa polypeptide retained by the affinity resin was in-gel-digested with trypsin and the generated peptides separated by RP-HPLC, concentrated on Poros R2-beads, and transferred to the MALDI target as described previously (22Gevaert K. Demol H. Sklyarova T. Vandekerckhove J. Houthaeve T. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For protein identification, peptide ions were subjected to post-source decay (PSD) analysis and the Sequest algorithm (23Mann M. Wilm M. Anal.

A1a234 and a1tsa234 cells grown overnight at 24 °C in SD medium to 1 OD660, and, when required, starved for 2 h in SD-N medium, were concentrated to 25 OD660 and incubated in fresh medium at 24 °C for 30 min. The cell suspension was divided in two, then incubated at 24 or 37 °C for 2 min, and the cells labeled for 10 min with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per OD660unit. The labeled protein was chased by resuspension of the cells in SD or SD-N medium containing 4 mm cysteine and 8 mm methionine. Chasing was terminated by addition of cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. The protein precipitates were left on ice for 15 min, collected by centrifugation at low speed, washed with cold acetone, dried, and upon their freezing in liquid nitrogen, resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA (buffer S) containing 1% SDS by vigorous vortexing using glass beads. Samples were then boiled for 4 min, diluted 5-fold in 2.5 volumes with buffer S, and then made 0.25% Tween 20 and 0.1 m NaCl. Equal amounts of protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rabbit anti-API serum (5Seguı́-Real B. Martı́nez M. Sandoval I.V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5476-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and then for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with buffer S, 0.15 m NaCl, boiled in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-10% PAGE, and the fixed gels treated with 1 m sodium salicylate, dried, and autoradiographed. a1tsa234 cells were grown at 24 °C to 1 OD660 in SD medium, spheroplasted, and metabolically labeled and chased at 24 and 37 °C. Spheroplasts were adjusted to 15 OD660/ml with SL medium (1m sorbitol, 1% glucose, 1% proline, 0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, with the appropriate auxotrophic requirements) (2Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and 1 ml was preincubated for 20 min and metabolically labeled for 10 min with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine per OD660 at the temperature of choice. Labeled spheroplasts were then diluted 10-fold in SL medium containing 8 mm methionine, 4 mmcysteine, and 0.2% yeast extract and chased for 2 min or 4 h. Chases were stopped by incubation for 2 min with 10 mmNaN3 and lysates from spheroplasts prepared by osmotic lysis in 200 mm sorbitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.8. Unlysed spheroplasts were removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 500 ×g. Lysates were treated at 4 °C for 30 min with 50 μg/ml proteinase K (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the absence and presence of 0.2% Triton X-100. Digestion by the protease was stopped with a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin at 1 μg/ml each) and the protein precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, using 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin as carrier, and API immunoprecipitated as described above and analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE and autoradiography. a1tsa234Δape1 cells carrying the 2-μ pGAL-API were grown in SRaf medium overnight to 1 OD660 and then shifted to SGal medium for 4 h at 24 or 37 °C. The cells were incubated the last 15 min in SGal medium with or without 20 mm NaN3, harvested by low speed at the corresponding temperatures, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crude cell extracts prepared with glass beads in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors were fractionated by centrifugation on glycerol (20–50%) (8Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the gradient fractions scrutinized for API by Western blot using the rabbit polyclonal anti-API antibody. Incubation of [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled S150 and P150 fractions with prepro(API)-peptidyl-agarose (Sulfolink) resulted in specific retention of a 70-kDa polypeptide as shown both by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography (Fig.1 A). The mass spectrometric screening of HPLC fractions from a trypsin digest of the 70-kDa polypeptide showed that 16 out of 18 collected fractions contained peptide material. The peptide ion with a m/z value of 1424.63 in fraction 7 (Fig. 1 B, left) was subjected to PSD analysis (Fig. 1 B, right). After manually denoting all the γ ions displayed in the PSD spectrum (23Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), a sequence tag (303.14) SEQ/KEDE (1020.06) was obtained. Additional information regarding the presence of phenylalanine and serine residues in the peptide was deduced from the detection of specific ammonium ions of both amino acids. The search of the peptide in a nonredundant protein data base using the Sequest algorithm (24Griffin P.R. MacCoss M.J. Eng J.K. Blevins R.A. Aaronson J.S. Yates 3rd., J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 9: 1546-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) led to the NH2-FKEEDEKESQR-COOH sequence present in the Ssa1p and Ssa2p proteins of yeast (Fig. 1 C). This finding was confirmed by PSD analysis of two other peptide ions present in both the Ssa1p and Ssa2p proteins (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, 15 peptide masses shared by both homologue proteins could be identified in the different HPLC fractions. One peptide mass was found to be unique for Ssa1p and three for Ssa2p. The presence of both proteins Ssa1p and Ssa2p in the polypeptide band was confirmed by PSD analysis of two of these unique peptides (Fig. 1 C). To further investigate if the interaction of the Ssa1p/Ssa2p pair with the prepro-NH2 extension of the pAPI required a structural motif contained in the primary or secondary structure of the peptide, the Ile residue in position 7 was substituted by a Gly. This substitution has been shown to disrupt the α−helix conformation of the peptide into a random coil and to inhibit the transport of the pAPI to the vacuole (7Martı́nez E. Jiménez M.A. Seguı́-Real B. Vandekerckhove J. Sandoval I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1124-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We observed that the introduction of Gly in position 7 did not suppress the retention of the Ssa1p and Ssa2p by prepro(API)-peptidyl affinity columns (data not shown), thus indicating that the two chaperones recognized a motif contained in the primary structure of the peptide (see “Discussion”). To examine whether Ssa1p was actually involved in the targeting of the pAPI to the vacuole, we studied the processing of the pAPI by a1tsa234 cells. These cells were developed by introducing the disrupted SSA2, SSA3, andSSA4 genes as well as a ssa1 ts allele from a1-45 cells (12Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) in the genetic background of W303-1b. After their shift to the nonpermissive temperature, the a1-45 cells have been shown to stop growing immediately as well as to undergo defects in the translocation and processing of several ER and mitochondrial protein precursors (12Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Processing of the pAPI into the mature form was first studied in a1tsa234 cells under vegetative conditions (Fig.2). The cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine at either 24 or 37 °C and then chased for periods between 0 and 120 min. Processing was analyzed by autoradiography of the precursor and mAPI species immunoprecipitated and separated by SDS-PAGE. It was observed that whereas the precursor was converted into the mature form at 24 °C, the permissive temperature for Ssa1p activity, the conversion was completely inhibited at the restrictive temperature. These results strongly suggest that cytosolic Ssa1p is involved in the transport of the pAPI to the vacuole where its conversion into the mature form occurs. Furthermore, the absence of mAPI species after the 120-min chase at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) strongly suggests that in the absence of Ssa1p the mechanism of API transport is blocked rather than slowed down. To study whether Ssa1p mediates the transport of pAPI to the vacuole in starved cells, a1tsa234 cells grown in SD medium at 24 °C were subjected to nitrogen starvation for 2.5 h. Transport of the pAPI to the vacuole was studied in a pulse-chase experiment as described above. As observed in vegetative cells the starved cells were able to process the pAPI into the mature form at 24 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig. 2). This result indicates that Ssa1p is also essential for the transport of the pAPI to the vacuole in nitrogen-starved cells. Previous studies have shown that cells carrying thessa1 ts allele recovered their ability to grow upon shifting the incubation temperature from 37 to 24 °C (12Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated whether the recovery of the Ssa1p activity at the permissive temperature rescued the processing of newly synthesized pAPI molecules. For this purpose, first, a1tsa234 cells preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min were labeled at 24 °C for 10 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and after their chase at the same temperature for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min the conversion of pAPI into mAPI analyzed by immunoprecipitation and autoradiography. The study revealed a progressive conversion of pAPI into mAPI in the 60–120-min period (Fig. 3 A), thus indicating that the inhibition of the pAPI transport to the vacuole was reversed. Furthermore, when the experiment was repeated by performing the labeling at 37 °C, the result was comparable (Fig.3 B). This result indicated that the pAPI synthesized at 37 °C was rescued at the permissive temperature and transported and processed in the vacuole (see “Discussion”). The observation that newly synthesized pAPI molecules are assembled into homododecamers in the cytoplasm and transported in this form into the vacuole (8Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) prompted us to study if Ssa1p was required for their assembly. For this purpose, a1tsa234Δape1 cells carrying the pGAL-API plasmid were induced with galactose for 4 h at both 24 and 37 °C and crude extracts fractionated by sedimentation velocity centrifugation in glycerol gradients as described (8Kim J. Scott S.V. Oda M.N. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Western analysis of the gradient fractions using an anti-API specific antibody showed that at both temperatures pAPI migrated with the mobility expected for dodecamers (Fig.4), thus excluding a role for Ssa1p and the other family members in their assembly. To further define the role of Ssa1p/Ssa2p in the targeting of pAPI to the vacuole, we investigated whether pAPI molecules were retained or not in the cytoplasm at the permissive and restrictive temperature. This is important since Ssa1p/Ssa2p are localized in the cytoplasm and it has been reported in a recent study that all the pAPI in the cell is within vesicles in a Δssa1 mutant (25Satyanarayana C. Schroder-Kohne S. Craig E.A. Schu P.V. Horst M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the sensitivity of newly synthesized pAPI molecules to proteinase K was studied in a1tsa234 spheroplasts pulsed for 10 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine at 24 and 37 °C and then chased 2 min or 4 h at the corresponding temperature. The long chase period was adjusted to the slow processing of pAPI in spheroplasts at 24 °C, which amounted to 60–70% of the newly synthesized pAPI during a 4-h chase (not shown). The protection of labeled pAPI from proteinase K digestion in the absence or presence of detergent was analyzed in osmotically lysed spheroplasts by autoradiography after immunoprecipitation (see “Experimental Procedures” and the legend to Fig. 5). When lysates from a1tsa234 spheroplasts were incubated at the permissive temperature, it was observed that between 2 min and 4 h after its synthesis nearly 85% of pAPI was converted into iAPI (i.e. intermediate API) and mAPI. Moreover, in the absence of detergent, the majority of pAPI and iAPI was digested by proteinase K into the comparatively protease-resistant mAPI, whereas in its presence digestion was complete (Fig. 5 A). It should be noted that no significant vacuolar disruption, that would have interfered with the protease protection assay, occurred during lysis of spheroplasts, as shown by the absence of mAPI in the immunoprecipiates obtained from spheroplasts chased for 2 min at the permissive temperature. When the experiment was performed with lysates from a1tsa234 spheroplasts incubated at the restrictive temperature, we observed that 4 h after its synthesis the majority of pAPI remain unprocessed, the small amount of mAPI detected probably being generated by minor vacuolar breakage during the disruption of the spheroplasts by osmotic lysis. Moreover, all the pAPI was digested by the protease in the absence of detergent (Fig. 5 A). Analysis of the protease protection of CPY in a parallel experiment run under the conditions described for pAPI showed that, as expected, after 2 min of chase the CPY precursor (pCPY) transported through the secretory pathway was protected from proteinase K in the absence of detergent, whereas it was digested into the protease-resistant mature form (mCPY) when detergent was added. Furthermore, after 4 h of chase, CPY was observed to migrate with the size corresponding to mCPY and to be resistant to the protease both in the absence or presence of detergent (Fig. 5 B). These results were consistent with the entrance of pCPY in the secretory pathway concomitant with its synthesis and reassessed the validity of the protease protection assay as a valid technique to study the retention of pAPI in the cytoplasm. Altogether these results indicated that a significant amount of the pAPI synthesized and chased at the permissive temperature remained unprotected in the cytoplasm long after its synthesis and that at the restrictive temperature in the absence of a functional Ssa1p protein, all the precursor retained in the cytoplasm was unprotected. The results of studies on the transport of API to the vacuole are compatible with two models of transport that are not mutually exclusive. In the first model, API assembled into dodecamers is selectively wrapped by a double membrane sac that eventually fuses with the vacuole to unload the protein packed in the inner vesicles into the vacuolar lumen (9Scott S.V. Baba M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The second model proposes that the precursor is translocated through the membrane of a transport intermediate or the vacuolar membrane (5Seguı́-Real B. Martı́nez M. Sandoval I.V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5476-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We show here that Ssa1p and Ssa2p, the two constitutive chaperones involved in the folding, oligomerization, and targeting of proteins from the cytosol to such diverse organelles as ER (14Kim S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6750-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), interact specifically in vitro with the peptide that mimics the prepro-NH2extension of pAPI, an extension that is necessary and sufficient for the targeting of pAPI to the vacuole (11Martinez E. Seguı́-Real B. Silles E. Mazon M.J. Sandoval I.V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The predominance of the 70-kDa peptides among the few proteins retained by the prepro(API)-peptidyl affinity column stresses the specificity of the interaction between the Ssa1p/Ssa2p and the prepro-NH2extension of pAPI. Nevertheless, when considering that chaperones often bind to exposed hydrophobic patches on incompletely folded proteins and that most of the peptide mimicking the pre-part and the pre-(Gly7) peptide are unfolded, the possibility that theirin vitro interaction could be unspecific should be considered. With regard to this, it is important to note that the mean hydrophobicity per residue of nonpolar face in the pre-part (MEEQREGLEQLLKKTLQ) is only 0.28 (7Martı́nez E. Jiménez M.A. Seguı́-Real B. Vandekerckhove J. Sandoval I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1124-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that the pro-part (MLTVEPSKNNQIANEEKEKKENENSW) is even less hydrophobic. These observations make it unlikely that the interaction of the prepro-NH2 extension with Ssa1p/Ssa2p is an artifact provoked by the physicochemical properties of the peptide. We have shown that, in aqueous solution, only 24% of the peptide mimicking the pre-part and 1.7–2.4% of the pre-(Gly7) peptide fold into an α−helix (7Martı́nez E. Jiménez M.A. Seguı́-Real B. Vandekerckhove J. Sandoval I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1124-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, Ssa1p/Ssa2p are retained with similar efficiency by the prepro- and pre-(Gly7) pro-affinity columns, suggesting that either the motifs recognized by the chaperones are contained in the primary structure of the pre-part or in the pro-part. In addition, the recovery of the pAPI extracted from a1tsa234 cells grown at 24 and 37 °C as a dodecamer upon centrifugation in glycerol gradients indicates that Ssa1p is not involved in its oligomerization. The inhibition of the conversion of pAPI into mAPI in a1tsa234 cells incubated at the restrictive temperature under either vegetative or nitrogen starvation conditions indicates that Ssa1p mediates the transport of pAPI to the vacuole under both conditions. This result is in contrast with recent observations by Satyanarayana et al. (25Satyanarayana C. Schroder-Kohne S. Craig E.A. Schu P.V. Horst M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) who have reported that Ssa1p is not involved in the transport of pAPI to the vacuole under nitrogen starvation conditions favoring autophagocytosis. The possibility that Ssa1p may play a role in engaging the properly folded precursor with the capture/transport machineries that operate in its transport to the vacuole should be considered. Wrapping of pAPI complexes by double membrane sacs might only occur after their interaction with the cytoplasmic chaperone, whereas if pAPI is translocated through the membranes of transport vesicles/vacuole the chaperone could interact with a specific membrane receptor. The demonstration that a significant amount of newly synthesized pAPI remains unprotected in the cytoplasm 4 h after its synthesis, at the permissive temperature, as shown by the protease protection assay, agrees with the results of previous studies (2Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1727-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and seems to discard the existence of membrane barriers between pAPI and Ssa1p that could prevent their interaction, as indicated in a recent study (25Satyanarayana C. Schroder-Kohne S. Craig E.A. Schu P.V. Horst M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the complete digestion of the pAPI synthesized and chased for 4 h at the restrictive temperature, by proteinase K in the absence of detergent, indicates that the inactivation of Ssa1p inhibits the pAPI protection. This observation strongly suggests that the chaperone mediates the capture/downloading of pAPI into Cvt vesicles. We thank Drs. E. Craig and G. Högenauer for kindly supplying the a1-45 yeast strain and the anti-CPY antibody, respectively. We are also indebted to Dr. F. Portillo for helpful discussions."

D., and Opperdoes, F.R. (1997) Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 89, 51–59). Here, we show that the low specificity of the latter isoenzyme is the result of a number of recent gene duplications that gave rise to a family of glycosomal 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase genes. Two of these genes were cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Although both gene products have 322 amino acids, share 90.4% identical residues, and have a similar hydrophobicity profile and net charge, their kinetic properties were strikingly different. One isoform behaved as a real malate dehydrogenase with a high specificity for oxaloacetate, whereas the other showed no activity with oxaloacetate but was able to reduce other oxoacids, such as phenyl pyruvate, 2-oxoisocaproate, 2-oxovalerate, 2-oxobutyrate, 2-oxo-4-methiolbutyrate, and pyruvate. Phytomonas sp. contains two malate dehydrogenase isoforms, a mitochondrial isoenzyme with a high specificity for oxaloacetate and a glycosomal isozyme that acts on a broad range of substrates (Uttaro, A.

In eukaryotes it is present in different subcellular compartments and takes part in different metabolic pathways (1Musrati R.A. Kollárová M. Mernik N. Mikulásová D. Gen. Physiol.

MDH utilizes either the cofactor NAD+ or NADP+to catalyze the reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate. MDHs are generally active as dimers with identical subunits. Exceptions are the MDH of various Bacillus species, in which the enzyme is tetrameric (2Banaszak L.J. Bradshaw R.A. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 11.

Parasitol. 2000; 105: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported the purification of both a mitochondrial and glycosomal MDH from Trypanosoma cruzi. As in Bacillus, the latter glycosomal isoenzyme appeared to be tetrameric, thus representing the first example of an eukaryotic tetrameric MDH. The cloning and sequencing of genes coding for the mitochondrial and glycosomal MDH isoenzymes from Trypanosoma brucei has been reported (6Anderson S.A. Carter V. Parsons M. Exp. Parasitol. 1998; 89: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7Anderson S.A. Carter V. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), but no information is available on the quaternary structure of these enzymes. We previously described that Phytomonas sp., a trypanosomatid of plants, has two isoforms of MDH, a mitochondrial form and a glycosomal form (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Phytomonas sp. do not contain an active citric acid cycle, and the mitochondrial MDH is believed to be part of a system transferring reducing equivalents from the glycosome to the mitochondrion (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Chaumont F. Schanck A.N. Blum J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem.

Biochem Parasitol. 1992; 54: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which regenerates NAD+ for glycolysis. We have purified the glycosomal MDH from Phytomonas. By contrast with glycosomal MDH from T. cruzi,Phytomonas MDH behaves as a homodimer with a low substrate specificity. In in vitro assays, it can also accept oxaloacetate, phenylpyruvate, 2-oxocaproate, and 2-oxoisocaproate as substrates (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because of the presumed important role of this enzyme in Phytomonas' energy metabolism and its unusual properties, we decided to clone its gene and overexpress the corresponding protein. This allowed us to study the nature of the apparent low substrate specificity in detail. The Phytomonas strain was isolated in France from Euphorbia characias (11Dollet M. Cambrony D. Gargani D. C. R. Acad. Sci. ( Ser. iii ). 1982; 295: 547-550Google Scholar). Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, CM-Sepharose, and blue-Sepharose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oxaloacetic acid, malic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, 2-oxocaproic acid, 2-oxoisocaproic acid, 2-oxovaleric acid, 2-oxobutyric acid, 2-oxo-4-methiolbutyric acid, and pyruvic acid were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from New England BioLabs. Hybond-N nylon membrane was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Pancreatic bovine DNase (type IV) was from Sigma. Wild-type MDH was purified from 1 liter of Phytomonas culture exactly as described before (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, a method was used involving hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose at pH 7.8 followed by ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Sepharose and affinity chromatography on blue-Sepharose at pH 6.8. Recombinant enzymes were purified from 1 liter of Escherichia coli culture. Cells were resuspended in buffer A (Tris-HCl 25 mm, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium azide). DNase I (1 mg/ml) and MgCl2 (10 mm) were added immediately before the preparation of extracts using a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). Ammonium sulfate and Triton X-100 were added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1 m and 0.05%, respectively and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.4 × 25 cm) equilibrated in 1 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml of the same buffer and eluted with a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient (1 m–50 mm, 300 ml), followed by a wash with 50 ml of 50 mm ammonium sulfate and a gradient of ethylene glycol from 0 to 70% in buffer A (300 ml). Fractions of 7 ml were collected, and those containing activity were pooled and loaded onto a blue-Sepharose column (1 × 7 ml) equilibrated with 200 mm NaCl in buffer A. The column was washed with the same buffer followed by a 60-ml gradient of NaCl (0.2–1 m). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Analytical SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Chua (13Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-446Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The glycosomal MDH was purified by SDS-PAGE. Bands (corresponding to about 20 μg of protein) were cut from the gel, concentrated by the agarose-based gel concentration system, and digested with trypsin (14Rider M.H. Puype M. Van Damme J. Gevaert K. De Boeck S. D'Alayer J. Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC (14Rider M.H. Puype M. Van Damme J. Gevaert K. De Boeck S. D'Alayer J. Rasmussen H.H. Celis J.E. Vandekerckhove J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and selected peptides were sequenced on a 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A genomic library made in E. coli MB406 using the phage vector λGEM-11 (Promega) was screened by hybridization with a T.bruceiglycosomal MDH probe (7Anderson S.A. Carter V. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) labeled by nick translation. Positive recombinant λGEM-11 phages were purified and rescreened. High titer phage lysates were prepared, and DNA was purified from phages as described (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction fragments from the recombinant phages were subcloned into the phagemid vectors pBluescript SIIKS (+/−) and pBluescript SIISK (+/−) from Stratagene.E. coli strain XL-1-blue was used for propagation of the recombinant phagemids. Both strands were sequenced using the T7 DNA polymerase kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and specific primers. 2-Hydroxyacid dehydrogenase genes were amplified by PCR from phage DNA using the oligonucleotide U1 (5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCCCATGTGTGTGTT), which contains a 5′NdeI artificial restriction site with 18 nucleotides that correspond to the 5′ end of the gene, and D1 (5′-CGGGATCCTTAGAGCTTAGAGAGCGCAA), which has 20 nucleotides complementary to the 3′ end including the TAA stop codon and an artificial BamHI restriction site. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned in the pT7-7.1 expression vector (16Allert S. Ernest I. Poliszczak A. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and digested with NdeI and BamHI. The sequences were verified before introduction into E. coli BL-21 containing the plasmid pLysS. The transformed cells were grown at 30 °C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression was induced at anA 600 nm of 0.6 by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm; growth was continued overnight. Southern blots were carried out on Hybond-N membranes with 4 μg of total DNA from Phytomonas sp. digested with different restriction enzymes. To determine the copy number of genes, the complete gene was amplified by PCR using the U1 and D1 oligonucleotides, radioactively labeled to be used as probes. To estimate the relative number of gMDH andgHADH genes, a probe was obtained by PCR amplification of a noncoding region downstream of the gene (from base pairs 1472 to 2030; see Fig. 1) using the oligonucleotides U6 (5′-CTTTAATATGGCTTTGTAG) and D3 (5′-TCTTGCAGAATGATGCTG). All experiments were repeated three times. Using the autoradiograph as a template, the radioactive bands were cut from the nylon membrane and counted for radioactivity. Dehydrogenases were assayed spectrophotometrically by following the 2-oxoacid-dependent oxidation of NADH or the 2-hydroxyacid-dependent reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm and 25 °C. Optimal pH and buffers for forward and reverse reactions were as described previously (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate/min at 25 °C. All available glycosomal MDH protein sequences, as well as the E. coli MDH, which served as an outgroup, were aligned using the program ClustalX (17Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55973) Google Scholar). Positions with gaps were removed, and pairwise distances were calculated using a correction for multiple hits and back mutations according to Kimura (18Kimura M. J. Mol. Evol. 1980; 16: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23610) Google Scholar) as implemented in the Protdist program (19Felsenstein J. PHYLIP ( Phylogeny Inference Package ), Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using the programs Puzzle 4.01 (20Strimmer K. Von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2276) Google Scholar) (maximum likelihood), Protdist together with Neighbor (distance matrix analysis), and Protpars (maximum parsimony) (19Felsenstein J. PHYLIP ( Phylogeny Inference Package ), Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle1993Google Scholar). All methods used gave the same tree topology. Also, using the program Puzzle, the possibility of the functioning of a constant molecular clock was analyzed. Glycosomal MDH was purified fromPhytomonas cells as described (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Following gel purification, concentration in agarose, and trypsin digestion, peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Five peptides were chosen for Edman sequencing and were found back in the gMDH sequence (Fig.2 A). In a primary search of the GenBankTM, peptides 1, 3, and 4 showed high similarity with other MDHs. All attempts to amplify specific fragments from genomicPhytomonas DNA by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the gMDH peptide sequences were unsuccessful. Therefore, we decided to clone the gene by making use of a heterologous probe. A 2.4-kb fragment containing the T. brucei glycosomal MDH cDNA (7Anderson S.A. Carter V. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled and used to screen a genomic library fromPhytomonas. We screened 1.5 × 104 plaques resulting in the isolation of 100 positive clones. Eight of 10 selected clones presented a similar restriction pattern with HindIII and PstI and, upon hybridization with the probe, their 0.5- and 1.3-kb HindIII and 1.0-kb PstI fragments were recognized. Subsequent subcloning and sequencing of these fragments from phage 2 revealed an uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) of 966 nucleotides, containing a deduced sequence of 322 amino acids (Fig.2 A) with 70% positional identity with T. bruceiglycosomal MDH (7Anderson S.A. Carter V. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and a calculated molecular weight of 33,728. Three of five peptides matched 100% with this sequence (Fig.2 A). The putative ATG start codon of this ORF was found at position 443 of the nucleotide sequence. The TAA terminator codon was found at position 1409, immediately after three codons encoding a potential carboxyl-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS-1), SKL (21Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was carried out on DNA from each of the eight phage clones and genomic DNA using an upstream oligonucleotide (U1) designed on the first 18 bases of the ORF present in phage 2 and a downstream degenerate (5′-TADGTYTACCCNCCNCTRCTYCA) oligonucleotide (Deg) complementary to the deduced DNA sequence from peptide 3 (Figs.1 and 2 A). Only genomic DNA and phages 1, 3, and 5 allowed the amplification of a 670-bp DNA fragment. Subcloning and sequencing of the HindIII andPstI fragments from phage 3 revealed an identity of 96.3% at the DNA level with phage 2 and the presence of an ORF of 966 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence was 90.4% identical to that encoded in phage 2 and also presented a PTS-1 with SKL. It was 72% identical to T. brucei gMDH (7Anderson S.A. Carter V. Parsons M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular weight was 33,694, and all of the five peptides could be identified within the deduced amino acid sequence. Both genes coded for proteins with similar net charge and hydrophobicity profile (Fig.2 B). The dehydrogenases derived from clones 2 and 3 were cloned into the pT7-7.1 vector and expressed in E. coli. The overexpression of recombinant enzyme was possible only when the cells were grown in minimal medium plus glucose and after induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C. Under these conditions, the expression of endogenous bacterial MDH was reduced (22Park S.-J. Cotter P.A. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6652-6656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and crude extracts from E. coli transformed with the clone 3 gene exhibited activity only with oxaloacetate as substrate, indicative of an authentic MDH. However, when the cells were transformed with the gene derived from clone 2, extracts showed a high activity with other 2-oxoacids such as phenylpyruvate, 2-oxocaproate, or 2-oxoisocaproate, whereas the activity with oxaloacetate was very low and comparable with that found for nontransformed E. coli. Therefore, we conclude that this gene codes for thePhytomonas gHADH. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography of crude extracts from transformed E. coli on phenyl-Sepharose chromatography yielded two peaks of dehydrogenase activity. One peak eluted with 50 mm ammonium sulfate and was specific for oxaloacetate as substrate, coinciding with the endogenous E. coli MDH. The second peak of activity eluted in a gradient of ethylene glycol and was specific for oxaloacetate as substrate when transformation was carried out with the gMDH gene and specific for the other 2-oxoacids when the gHADH gene was used for the transformation. This peak was absent in crude extracts of nontransformed E. coli. The second peak of activity was purified by blue-Sepharose affinity chromatography for further characterization. In both cases, a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 35,000 was obtained on SDS-PAGE. Kinetic parameters were determined with recombinant enzymes purified from E. coli transformed withPhytomonas gHADH and gMDH genes. gMDH was highly specific for oxaloacetate (Km = 117 μm, V max = 163 units/mg of protein) in the reductive reaction and malate (Km = 1.93 mm, V max = 42 units/mg of protein) in the oxidative reaction. gHADH did not show activity with either of these substrates but was able to reduce a series of other 2-oxoacids such as phenylpyruvate (Km = 185 μm, V max = 147 units/mg of protein), 2-oxoisocaproate (Km = 875 μm, V max = 140 units/mg of protein), 2-oxocaproate, 2-oxovalerate, 2-oxobutyrate, 2-oxo 4-methiolbutyrate, and pyruvate. Total genomic DNA from Phytomonassp. was digested with restriction enzymes, submitted to Southern blot analysis, and hybridized with a probe obtained by PCR amplification with primers U1 and D1 on total DNA. This probe represented a mixture of full-length 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase genes. Fig.3 A shows the result of using enzymes (BamHI, KpnI, NdeI,XbaI, and XhoI) for which no recognition sites were found in the sequenced fragments. Of these, only NdeI and KpnI showed a pattern of bands that could be because of a polymorphic distribution of repeated gHADH and gMDHgenes in the genome of Phytomonas sp. The experiment was repeated three times to rule out the possibility of partial digestion. The relative intensity of each band for NdeI was 1:1:1:3:6:1:15 and for KpnI, 1:27. From this ratio we estimated the total copy number of the genes to be 28. As shown in Fig. 1, the gMDH gene has a SacI restriction site at position 1334 that is absent in gHADH. We used this difference to estimate the relative copy number of each type of gene. Fig. 3 B shows a Southern blot experiment in which a HindIII-SacI double digestion is compared with a single HindIII digestion of genomic DNA hybridized with a probe that represents the noncoding region downstream of the gene (between U6 and D3 in Fig. 1). The remaining radioactivity in band A1 (the 1305-bp HindIII fragment) corresponded to 29% of band A2 or 23% of the total radioactivity present in band A1 plus B1(the 837-bp HindIII-SacI fragment, Fig.3 B), indicating that one-quarter (6–7 of 28 copies) of the genes are gHADH. A BLAST search using Phytomonas gMDH showed maximum positional identity with Leishmania major(74%), T. brucei (72%), and T. cruzi (70%) glycosomal MDHs. 2Following is a list of MDH sequences used in this paper with their respective GenBankTM accession numbers: Leishmania major, emb AL117268.1 LMFL4520; Trypanosoma brucei, gb AF079110.1; Trypanosoma cruzi, gb AF051893.1;Escherichia coli K-12 chromo, gb U18997.1; E. coli K-12, gb AE000403.1. The next most similar sequence corresponded to E. coli MDH, which was used as an outgroup for a phylogenetic analysis. As shown in Fig.4, the resulting tree is in good agreement with our previous data based on another glycosomal enzyme, glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (23Hannaert V. Opperdoes F.R. Michels P.A. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and with data presented by others using ribosomal RNA sequences (24Stevens J.R. Gibson W. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 432-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The data also indicate thatPhytomonas, despite the fact that its metabolism resembles that of the bloodstream form of the African trypanosome (9Chaumont F. Schanck A.N. Blum J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Sanchez-Moreno M. Lasztity D. Coppens I. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem Parasitol. 1992; 54: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), is more related to Leishmania on the basis of the gMDH comparison. In a previous work, we detected two MDH isoforms inPhytomonas sp., a mitochondrial isoenzyme with a high specificity for oxaloacetate and a glycosomal isozyme that could act on a broad range of substrates (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown here, the low specificity of the latter enzyme may be attributed to the presence of a family of glycosomal 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase genes. Two of these genes were cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed in E. coli. Both enzymes have 322 amino acids and have 90.4% positional identity. They have similar hydrophobicity profiles and net charges. However, the kinetic properties of these recombinant enzymes are strikingly different. gMDH behaves as a real MDH with a high specific activity for oxaloacetate. In contrast, the overexpressed enzyme from clone 2 (gHADH) exhibits no activity toward oxaloacetate but is able to reduce other oxoacids such as phenyl pyruvate (Km = 185 μm) and 2-oxoisocaproate (Km = 875 μm), in good agreement with our previous results (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The copurification of both activities from glycosomes ofPhytomonas as a homogeneous protein as reported in our previous paper (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) could be because of the formation of heterodimers between both types of polypeptides or because of the highly similar physicochemical properties of both homodimers. Our results could not distinguish between these possibilities. Coexpression experiments with one of the genes containing tagged sequences (as polyhistidine tails) are in progress. As shown before, the specific activity of the dehydrogenases in crude extracts of Phytomonas with phenylpyruvate as a substrate is one order of magnitude lower than with oxaloacetate (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, we estimate here that from the approximately 28 copies of dehydrogenase genes, there must be three gMDH genes for each gHADHgene, indicating that other types of regulation than gene dosage should be operational in Phytomonas to explain the observed level of relative expression. However, it cannot be excluded that part of the gHADHs represent pseudogenes, or genes of which the products have a lower specific activity than that of the one we describe in this paper. Both genes present a high degree of identity at the DNA level (94%), and this identity increases to 96%, also taking into account the extragenic sequence. This high identity is in agreement with the low degree of restriction enzyme polymorphism shown in Fig. 3. The presence of this family of HADH genes is probably the result of multiple events of duplication of an ancestral MDH gene, followed by the accumulation of mutations. Why all these genes remained and what could be the respective functions of the isoenzymes in the glycosome is still a matter of speculation. This gene family appears to be a typical characteristic of Phytomonas sp., since we have found evidence for it in 15 of 20 isolates analyzed (25Uttaro A.D. Sanchez-Moreno M. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The various members of this gene family could be involved in the utilization of different amino acids from the insect gut or from plant fluids, thus allowing for the regeneration of glycosomal NAD+. Indeed, we have detected leucin-, alanine-, aspartate-, and methionine-pyruvate aminotransferases in the cytosolic fractions of Phytomonas sp. (data not shown), the oxo-acids of which may all serve as substrates for the gHADH. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4), using all known glycosomal sequences together with E. coli MDH as an outgroup, shows that gene duplication leading to the appearance of thePhytomonas-specific gHADH must have been a relatively recent event. Assuming the functioning of a constant molecular clock, and using a value of 100 million years as the supposed time of divergence between salivarian and stercorarian trypanosomes (24Stevens J.R. Gibson W. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 432-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Lake J.A. de la Cruz V.F. Ferreira P.C.G. Morel C. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), it can be estimated that this event must have taken place approximately 45 million years ago. This is very recent indeed and suggests that a metabolic adaptation of Phytomonas, perhaps in response to the appearance of a new plant or insect host, must have occurred at that time. Separation of Leishmania andPhytomonas took place some 144 million years ago, whereas the trypanosomes diverged some 185 million years ago, which is in good agreement with previous estimations (24Stevens J.R. Gibson W. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 432-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Lake J.A. de la Cruz V.F. Ferreira P.C.G. Morel C. Simpson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4779-4783Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The high gene copy number of gMDH parallels the high specific activity of this enzyme in Phytomonas, which represents 80% (approximately 2.6 units/mg of protein) of the total MDH activity present in this organism (8Uttaro A.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This high activity relates to its important function in the regeneration of glycosomal NAD+, thus maintaining the oxidative power of the organelle required for the continuation of glycolysis. In Phytomonas, the latter pathway is essential because the citric acid cycle is absent. The situation is different in T. cruzi, where the mitochondrion is fully functional and the trypanosome utilizes predominantly amino acids as an energy source. Reynoso-Hunter et al. (5Reynoso-Hunter G. Hellman U. Cazzulo J.J. Nowicki C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that the glycosomal MDH isoenzyme represent only 25% of the total MDH activity, which amounts to 3 units/mg of protein, similar to that present in the Phytomonas organelle. The higher total specific activity of MDH in T. cruzi (12 units/mg of protein) is due to the high activity of the mitochondrial isozyme, in agreement with the full functionality of this organelle and its involvement in the citric acid cycle. Only 31 of 322 amino acids differ between both gene products. Arginine 89 of gMDH is changed to isoleucine in gHADH. Both residues are in an amino-terminal region believed to form a mobile loop at the top of the active site pocket. This Arg-102, in the numbering of the residues of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase (27Birktoft J.J. Fernley R.T. Bradshaw R.A. Banaszak L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6166-6170Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), is conserved in all known MDHs and forms a hydrogen bond with the second carboxyl group of oxaloacetate (28Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Feeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Science. 1988; 242: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The smaller isoleucine could result in an enlargement of the active site pocket to accommodate bigger substrates, as is the case for gHADH. Moreover, this mutation reduces the net positive charge of the active site pocket and its water solvation. As shown in Fig.2 A, the loop region appears to be a hot spot for mutation including, in addition, the replacement of valine 85 to glycine, alanine 88 to proline, and lycine 90 to methionine. All of these changes go in the same direction of reducing the net positive charge and increasing the volume of the active site pocket. The other residues known to be essential for dehydrogenase activity (Arg-95, Asp-158, Arg-161, and His-184) are all conserved in both proteins (29Wilks H.M. Hart K.W. Feeney R. Dunn C.R. Muirhead H. Chia W.N. Barstow D.A. Atkinson T. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Science. 1988; 242: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The fact that only a limited number of amino acid replacements is involved would facilitate the identification of residues that are involved in determining the substrate specificity. Experiments to identify such amino acids are in progress. We thank Dominique Cottem and Joris van Roy for technical assistance and Françoise Mylle for help in preparing the manuscript.

Contrary to the generalS-II gene, expression of the XSII-K1 gene was not detected in embryos at stages earlier than 11. The animal cap assay revealed that activin A, but not basic fibroblast growth factor, induced expression of the XSII-K1 gene and that it participated in the expression of mesoderm-specific genes such asXbra and Xα-actin.

Various factors that participate in the process of transcription have been identified, and many of them are transcription initiation factors (1Buratowski S. Science. 1995; 270: 1773-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 2Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 3Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4Roeder R.G.

These factors are essential for the modulation of RNA polymerase II, so that it can recognize the transcription initiation site on a specific gene and initiate correct transcription. These transcription initiation factors are divided into two groups as follows: general initiation factors, which are commonly required for transcription, and sequence-specific initiation factors, which initiate the transcription of a specific gene(s). Regulation of transcription elongation is assumed to be simpler than that of transcription initiation because, once RNA synthesis has begun, it is assumed to continue until RNA polymerase II reaches the transcription termination site. The number of transcription elongation factors is much lower than that of transcription initiation factors, but several have already been identified, such as S-II (TFIIS) (5Sekimizu K. Nakanishi Y.

S-II is unique in two respects. First, in various eukaryotic organisms, it forms a protein family with well conserved sequences of about 40 and 170 residues at their N and C termini, respectively, whereas each of the intervening sequence of about 50 residues is unique (10Hirashima S. Hirai H. Nakanishi Y. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3858-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Marshall T.K. Guo H. Price D.H.

Second, multiple S-II molecules are present in a single organism, as has been demonstrated in the mouse. One form of these molecules is general S-II (10Hirashima S. Hirai H. Nakanishi Y. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3858-3863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is ubiquitous in various cells, and the other forms are tissue-specific (37Kanai A. Kuzuhara T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1991; 109: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38Xu Q. Nakanishi T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol.

Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The above sequence rule is applicable to all these S-II molecules. Previously, we identified mouse SII-K1, which is expressed exclusively in heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Contrary to general S-II mRNA, SII-K1 mRNA was not detected in embryos at an early developmental stage but became detectable in 15- and 17-day-old embryos, suggesting a functional difference between general S-II and SII-K1 (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of SII-K1 in embryonic development, we cloned the cDNA for Xenopus laevis SII-K1 and examined the expression of theXenopus SII-K1 gene during development. To isolateXenopus SII-K1 cDNA, we performed RT-PCR1 usingXenopus kidney poly(A)+ RNA and two degenerate primers corresponding to Pro-178 to Asp-184 and Glu-339 to Cys-347 of SII-K1, followed by a nested PCR with degenerate primers corresponding to Asp-188 to Leu-194 and Asn-286 to Glu-293 (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment of 327 bp was amplified in this way. On the basis of the sequence of this DNA fragment, we performed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to obtain more complete Xenopus SII-K1 cDNA, and we cloned a PCR product of 1320 bp. This cDNA contained part of the N-terminal consensus region, a subsequent unique region, and the C-terminal consensus region of the S-II family protein. To isolate the full-length Xenopus SII-K1 cDNA, we performed plaque hybridization using a DNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides +2 to +349 of this cDNA as a probe. This probe corresponded to the junction region of the N-terminal consensus region and the subsequent unique region. In this way, we finally isolated a full-lengthXenopus SII-K1 cDNA consisting of 2,250 bp. To detect XenopusSII-K1 mRNA, poly(A)+ RNA was extracted fromXenopus embryos at stage 0, 7, 8, 11, 13, 18, 21, 26, 33, and 39 or adult Xenopus tissues (heart, brain, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis) and subjected to Northern blot hybridization. The probe used was the PCR product corresponding to nucleotides +335 to +683 of the Xenopus SII-K1 cDNA (2 × 109 cpm/μg). The same filter was rehybridized with part of the Xenopus EF1-α cDNA (41Dje M.K. Mazabraud A. Viel A. Le Maire M. Denis H. Crawford E. Brown D.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3489-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to assess the efficiency of RNA extraction. Each lane contained 1 μg of RNA. Whole mount in situ hybridization of Xenopus neurula and tail bud embryos was performed essentially as described previously (42Fukui A. Noda M. Asashima M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1997; 203: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Embryos were fixed in MEMFA (100 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 3.7% formalin) for 15 min at room temperature. They were then successively treated with 100, 75, 50, and 25% methanol for 5 min each time, followed by washing in a washing solution (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) three times for 5 min each time. The embryos were then treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min, 0.1 m triethanolamine twice for 5 min each time, 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine twice for 5 min each time. The embryos were washed in the washing solution twice for 2 min each time, and then treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and finally washed in the washing solution five times for 5 min each time. Prehybridization was performed by treating the embryos with hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 100 mg/ml heparin, 1× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mmEDTA, and 1 mg/ml tRNA) for 5 min at room temperature, followed by hybridization in hybridization solution containing 0.5 μg/ml probe at 60 °C for 18 h. The probe used was digoxigenin-labeled RNA corresponding to nucleotides +335 to +1003 of Xenopus SII-K1 cDNA. After hybridization, the embryos were incubated in 2× SSC containing 10 mg/ml RNase A and 2 mg/ml RNase T1 for 30 min and then treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 14 h at 4 °C. Antibody bound to the probe RNA was visualized by incubating the embryos with 75 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 50 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for 40 min at room temperature under dark condition. The embryos were made transparent by treating them with 100% methanol for 5 min at room temperature, followed by benzyl benzonate:benzyl alcohol, 2:1, and then photographed for examination. This was done essentially as described previously (43Takebayashi K. Takahashi S. Yokota C. Tsuda H. Nakanishi S. Asashima M. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Animal caps were dissected from stage 9 embryos and incubated upside down in 0.1× Steinberg solution supplemented with 10 ng/ml activin A (Genzyme) or bFGF (Progen) in 96-well plates for 6 h at 20 °C. The samples were then transferred to 0.1 × Steinberg solution without activin A or bFGF, and incubation was continued for 18 h at 20 °C. Then the total RNA was extracted from the animal caps, and expression of the Xenopus SII-K1, Xbra, and XEF1-αgenes was detected by RT-PCR. The primers used for RT-PCR were 5′-GCAACTTCAGATGTGGTTAAACCAACCC-3′ and 5′-GGTGGCCTCAGCTCTGAAGACCGATGATG-3′ for Xenopus SII-K1; 5′-GGATCGTTATCACCTCTG-3′ and 5′- GTGGTAGTCTGTAGCAGCA-3′ for Xbra; and 5′-CAGATTGGTGCTGGATATGC-3′ and 5′-ACTGCCTTGATGACTCCTAG-3′ for XEF1-α. Full-lengthXenopus SII-K1 mRNA was obtained by transcribing its cDNA ligated to pSP64T using a mMESSAGE kit (Ambion) and dissolved in Gurdon's solution. Stage 1 embryos were each injected with 0.2 μg of Xenopus SII-K1 mRNA at their animal poles as described previously (44Yokota C. Takahashi S. Eisaki A. Asashima M. Akhter S. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). When they reached stage 9, animal caps were dissected and incubated in 0.1× Steinberg solution for 24 h at 20 °C, as described above. Then total RNA was extracted from the animal caps, and expression of the Xbra (45Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) andα-actin genes (46Gurdon J.B. Mohun T.J. Brennan S. Cascio S. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 89: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar) as mesoderm markers was examined by RT-PCR. The primers used to detect α-actin mRNA were 5′-GGAGTCTGCAAGCTATCCATGAG-3′ and 5′-CACAATTGATTTTCCAGCCTCATC-3′. SII-K1 is a unique S-II family transcription factor whose expression is known to be developmentally regulated during the embryonic development of the mouse (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of SII-K1 in embryonic development, we isolated a cDNA for theXenopus homologue of SII-K1 on the basis of the sequence of mouse SII-K1. As shown in Fig. 1, this cDNA encoded a novel S-II family protein of 645 amino acid residues. The partial sequence of this cDNA was found to have been reported by Labhart and Morgan (47Labhart P. Morgan G.T. Genomics. 1998; 52: 278-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When the overall structures of this S-II and mouse SII-K1 were compared, significant sequence similarities were found in the N-terminal and C-terminal conserved regions, but the sequences between these two regions were totally different. A unique feature of this novel S-II was that it contained two repeated sequences of 18 and 50 residues in the non-conserved region (Fig.2 A). The former sequence was repeated nine times and the latter three times (Fig. 2, Band C). These repeated sequences were novel, and no information related to them has been available in the protein data bases searched so far. Although we isolated this cDNA on the basis of the sequence of mouse SII-K1 (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), it was difficult to conclude that this cDNA was that of the Xenopus homologue of mouse SII-K1. Therefore, by Northern blotting, we examined whether its expression was similar to that of mouse SII-K1 using RNA prepared from various tissues ofXenopus adults. As shown in Fig.3 A, an intense signal corresponding to a 2.5-kb RNA was detected in liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney, but no appreciable signal was detected in spleen, brain, and testis. This tissue-specific expression was very similar to that of mouse SII-K1 (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), except that significant expression was not detected in the heart. Signals of RNA species larger than 2.5 kb, including a relatively thick band in testis (white arrowhead), were probably those of other S-II family members. The size of XEF-1α mRNA in testis was a little larger than those of other tissues, suggesting that testis expresses a different subtype of XEF-1α family. Another characteristic feature of the expression of the mouseSII-K1 gene is its developmental regulation. SII-K1 mRNA first becomes detectable in 15-day-old embryos and is not present in embryos at much earlier stages (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B,the novel S-II mRNA was detected in embryos at stage 13 (neurula stage) or later and not in embryos at stages 0–11, indicating that its expression was also regulated developmentally. This expression was quite different from that of general S-II. General S-II mRNA (48Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was detected in embryos throughout stages 0–39. From these results, we concluded that this novel S-II (XSII-K1) is the Xenopushomologue of murine SII-K1. We located the expression of XSII-K1 by in situ hybridization using embryos at stage 13 (neurula) and stage 33 (tail bud). TheXSII-K1 gene was clearly expressed in the head, somites, and tail of embryos at the neurula stage (Fig.4 A), whereas it was expressed in mesoderm-derived tissues such as head mesenchyme, pharynx (branchial arches), and somites in embryos at the tail bud stage (Fig.4 B). No significant staining was detected with the sense RNA probe. These results suggest that XSII-K1 is involved in the development of dorsal mesoderm-derived tissues. During Xenopus development, activin A is known to induce dorsal mesoderm tissues (49Cornell R.A. Musci T.J. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas bFGF induces ventral mesoderm tissues (50Slack J.M. Darlington B.G. Gillespie L.L. Godsave S.F. Isaacs H.V. Paterno G.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1990; 327: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, using the animal cap assay, we investigated whether activin A or bFGF was able to induce expression of theXSII-K1 gene. Animal caps from embryos at the neurula stage were incubated with or without 10 ng/ml activin A or bFGF. Then total RNA was extracted, and expression of the XSII-K1 gene was examined by RT-PCR. As a specific control for mesoderm tissue, we examined expression of the Xbra gene simultaneously (45Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). To assess the recovery of RNA, RT-PCR was performed with XEF1-α mRNA (41Dje M.K. Mazabraud A. Viel A. Le Maire M. Denis H. Crawford E. Brown D.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3489-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). As is evident from Fig. 5, mRNA for XSII-K1 was detected only in the activin A-treated samples, although expression of the Xbra gene was induced by both activin A and bFGF (Fig. 6). Thus, it is clear that the XSII-K1 gene is expressed in the dorsal mesoderm and not the ventral mesoderm. These results are in accord with those of in situ hybridization.Figure 6Induction of expression of the mesoderm marker genes (Xbra andXα -actin) by injection of XSII-K1 mRNA. XSII-K1 mRNA was injected into the animal pole of embryos at stage 1 (one-cell stage). Animal caps were dissected at the neurula stage and incubated for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the animal caps, and expression of the Xbra(top), α-actin (middle), and XEF1-α (bottom) genes was detected by RT-PCR. NT, animal caps from non-treated embryos.RT(+) and RT(−) indicate experiments with or without RT reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It is obvious that the XSII-K1 gene is activated during the course of induction of the dorsal mesoderm by activin A. As XSII-K1 is a transcription elongation factor, it is assumed to participate in the transcription of mesoderm-specific genes, such as Xbra (45Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Therefore, using animal cap assay, we examined whether XSII-K1 alone is able to activate mesoderm-specific genes. For this, we injected XSII-K1 mRNA into the animal poles of stage 1 (one-cell stage) embryos. Animal caps were dissected from embryos at the neurula stage and incubated without activin A for 24 h. Then total RNA was extracted from the embryos, and expression of the Xbra gene was examined by RT-PCR. If XSII-K1 mRNA was injected in advance, the Xbra gene was found to be activated in the animal caps even in the absence of activin A, as shown in Fig. 6. We examined the expression of another mesoderm-specific gene, Xα-actin (46Gurdon J.B. Mohun T.J. Brennan S. Cascio S. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1985; 89: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar), and found that it was also activated under these conditions. These results suggested that some mesoderm-specific genes are located downstream of the XSII-K1 gene and that XSII-K1 induces their expression. This is the first report to suggest that mesoderm induction is regulated at the level of transcription elongation. In this study, we showed that Xenopus SII-K1 participates in the development of mesoderm-derived tissues. As SII-K1 is a transcription elongation factor that belongs to the S-II family (40Taira Y. Kubo T. Natori S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this is the first clear demonstration that tissue development is regulated at the level of transcription elongation. As well as in dorsal mesoderm-derived tissues such as head mesenchyme, somites and pharynx in the neural and tail bud embryos, XSII-K1 mRNA was shown to be expressed in the adult liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. Therefore, XSII-K1 seems to play roles in the process of tissue formation as well as tissue-specific transcription in mesoderm-derived adult tissues. In the animal cap assay, activin A was shown to activate the XSII-K1 gene. Once the XSII-K1 gene was activated in the precursor cells, the activated state seemed to be maintained even after completion of tissue formation. We believe that XSII-K1 participates in the transcription of genes whose expression is restricted to mesoderm-derived tissues. As S-II family transcription elongation factor has a unique sequence between the N-terminal and C-terminal conserved regions (10Hirashima S. Hirai H. Nakanishi Y. Natori S. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), this unique sequence seems to define its tissue specificity. In previous studies of mouse S-II, we demonstrated that SII-T1 and SII-K1 are expressed specifically in spermatocytes and various mesoderm-derived tissues, respectively (38Xu Q. Nakanishi T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3100-3103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ito T. Xu Q. Takeuchi H. Kubo T. Natori S.

However, we were unable to clarify their target genes. In the present study, we showed that the Xbra and Xα-actin genes are activated in the animal cap when XSII-K1 mRNA is directly injected into animal pole of one-cell stage embryos. These findings suggest that XSII-K1 participates in the transcription of these two genes. Therefore, these genes may contain a transcription arrest site(s) that can be read through by RNA polymerase II only in the presence of XSII-K1. We initially intended to isolate the Xenopus homologue of SII-K1. However, XSII-K1 was quite different from SII-K1 in terms of the amino acid sequence and molecular size of the unique region. Nonetheless, we defined it as Xenopus SII-K1 because its embryonic expression and tissue-specific expression were very similar to those of SII-K1. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that another S-II family protein bearing a closer similarity to SII-K1 is present in mesoderm-derived Xenopus tissues. In the cDNA clone of XSII-K1, no in frame termination codons were identified upstream of the first Met codon. However, we assigned this codon as the first Met codon by comparison with the sequences of other S-II family proteins. Moreover, this Met codon satisfied the Kozak's rule (51Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the unique region of XSII-K1 is quite different from those of other S-II family proteins. XSII-K1 contained two repeated sequences in this region consisting of 18 and 50 amino acid residues. Although the biological significance of these sequences is unknown, we assume that there is a protein(s) that interacts with this region in mesoderm-derived tissues. Identification and characterization of such a protein(s) may be essential to elucidate the way in which XSII-K1 regulates the transcription of mesoderm-specific genes such asXbra (45Smith J.C. Price B.M. Green J.B. Weigel D. Herrmann B.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) and Xα-actin (46Gurdon J.B. Mohun T.J. Brennan S. Cascio S. J. Embryol.

Some of these SHIP isoforms have recently been characterized at the level of primary sequence. In this report, we investigated the function of the recently characterized 135-kDa SHIP isoform (SHIPβ), which appears to possess the catalytic domain but lacks some of the protein-protein interaction motifs at the C terminus. By reconstituting SHIP-deficient DT40 B cells with either SHIPβ or the better-characterized p145 SHIPα, we addressed the function of SHIPβ in the complete absence of SHIPα . We observed that SHIPβ had enzymatic activity comparable with SHIPα and that SHIPβ was able to reconstitute FcγRIIB1-mediated inhibition of B cell receptor-induced signaling events such as calcium flux and Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. SHIPβ was readily phosphorylated in response to B cell receptor cross-linking with the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB1 and SHIPβ also interacted with the adapter protein Shc. During these studies we also observed that the SHIPα or SHIPβ interaction with Grb2 is not required for FcγRIIB1-mediated inhibition of calcium flux. These data suggest that SHIPβ, which is normally expressed in B cells along with SHIPα, functions comparably with SHIPα and that these two isoforms are not likely to be antagonistic in their function in vivo.

One such protein, the adaptor protein Grb2, is believed to bind to one or more of the proline-rich stretches of SHIP through one or both of its SH3 domains (1Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P.

Studies in various cells of hematopoietic origin have revealed SHIP isoforms of multiple molecular weights. Depending on the cell type being studied, SHIP species of 135, 125, and 110 kDa can be seen (3Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D.A. Chin S.M. Deuter-Reinhard M. Jefferson A.B. Norris F.A. Masiarz F.R. Cousens L.S.

Blood. 1997; 89: 1876-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these isoforms can be derived by proteolytic cleavage of the 145-kDa isoform (24Damen J.E. Liu L. Ware M.D. Ermolaeva M. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Blood. 1998; 92: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Others have been shown to be the result of alternative splicing of the SHIP mRNA (3Kavanaugh W.M. Pot D.A. Chin S.M. Deuter-Reinhard M. Jefferson A.B. Norris F.A. Masiarz F.R. Cousens L.S. Majerus P.W. Williams L.T. Curr.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, Lucas and Rohrschneider demonstrated that in murine myeloid cells the p135 isoform results from an alternatively spliced mRNA using cryptic splice donor and acceptor sites contained within the p145 coding sequence (22Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This splice results in the deletion of 183 bases from the mRNA and 61 amino acids from the protein. The deletion occurs immediately after tyrosine 917 and results in the loss of the putative phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) binding site and one of the proline-rich regions. Another splice variant has recently been described in which 167 nucleotides are spliced out of the message, resulting in a deletion followed by a frameshift mutation (26Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting protein product has a calculated molecular mass of 108 kDa, providing a possible identification of the approximately 110-kDa isoform. In addition to the shorter isoforms, FDC-P1 cells contain immunoreactive species of 165 kDa, and murine bone marrow cells express another isoform of approximately 175 kDa (23Geier S.J. Algate P.A. Carlberg K. Flowers D. Friedman C. Trask B. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1997; 89: 1876-1885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These larger molecular mass isoforms have not been characterized at the DNA level. Many of the shorter isoforms of SHIP have been identified to contain alterations in the C terminus of SHIP (22Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Damen J.E. Liu L. Ware M.D. Ermolaeva M. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Blood. 1998; 92: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that in addition to the catalytic activity of SHIP, the C terminus of SHIP is required for efficient SHIP function in B cells (13Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E. Su H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data suggest a requirement for as yet undefined regions in the C terminus of SHIP and may be indicative of a function for one or more of the polyproline regions in the SHIP C terminus. Since the differences in SHIP isoforms are predominantly in the C terminus, it is possible that these naturally occurring SHIP variants would have varying abilities to function as negative regulators due to the perturbations of the C terminus. If this were the case, an interesting possibility is that the function of p145 SHIP could be regulated through expression of other isoforms. Analysis of the function of individual isoforms of SHIP is complicated by the fact that more than one isoform of SHIP is expressed in any given cell line (1Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A system is therefore desired where the isoform to be studied is the only one expressed. Toward this goal, we have chosen to express individual isoforms of SHIP in a SHIP-deficient B cell line (27Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Studies from a number of laboratories have defined a critical role for SHIP in negative regulation of B cell receptor (BCR)-initiated signals (28Coggeshall K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Cell signaling pathways initiated by BCR stimulation include calcium flux and activation of many kinases, including the serine threonine kinases Akt/protein kinase B and MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (29DeFranco A.L.

In the later stages of an immune response, when a B cell binds an antigen through its BCR, the antibodies already bound to the antigen can simultaneously engage another receptor, FcγRIIB1, and the BCR. The phosphorylation of an inhibitory motif in the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIB1 and the subsequent recruitment of SHIP (through its SH2 domain) leads to a potent negative signal, resulting in inhibition of BCR-induced proliferation and Ig synthesis (8Ono M.

In this report, we have addressed the function of the 135-kDa isoform of the murine SHIP (referred to as SHIPβ as per Rohrschneider et al. (26Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar)) in FcγRIIB1-mediated inhibitory signaling and compared it to the better-characterized 145-kDa isoform of SHIP (referred to as SHIPα). Since SHIPβ has been seen in many cell lines, we reconstituted the SHIP-deficient DT40 B cell line with either SHIPα or SHIPβ and tested the function of each in the absence of the other isoform. We demonstrate that SHIPβ can fully substitute for SHIPα in DT40 B cells, suggesting that these two isoforms of SHIP are functionally interchangeable and that concurrent expression of both isoforms in B cells is not likely to be antagonistic in this system. The murine A20 cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 20 μm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The chicken B cell line DT40 was cultured in the same media as above, supplemented with 1% chicken serum (Sigma) and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. The DT40 cell lines with the disruptions of the SHIP and Grb2 genes have been previously described (27Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V.

Rabbit anti mouse IgM (F(ab′)2 and intact Ig) were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Anti-FcγRIIB1 antibody 2.4G2 was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Phosphospecific anti-Akt antibody (recognizing phosphorylated threonine 308) and the phosphospecific p44/p42 MAPK antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs. The sheep polyclonal anti-Akt antibody used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (Lake Placid, NY). The anti p44/p42 MAPK antibody used for immunoblotting was acquired from New England Biolabs. The rabbit polyclonal anti-Shc antibody used for immunoprecipitations was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The mouse monoclonal anti-Shc antibody (PG-797) used for immunoblotting was acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The P1C1 anti-SHIP mAb was acquired from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The P1D7 hybridoma was derived from a BALB/C mouse injected with a histidine-tagged protein representing amino acids 866–1020. The P2A8 hybridoma was generated by injecting mice with a synthetic peptide (EMINPNYIANRGPCPR, made by United Biochemical Research, Seattle WA) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) (22Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridoma supernatants were used in immunoblotting experiments at dilutions of 1:100 (P1D7) or 1:200 (P2A8). SHIP cDNA with a specific 183-nucleotide deletion (Δ183) has been described previously (22Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second spliced SHIP cDNA, lacking 167 nucleotides, has recently been reported (26Rohrschneider L.R. Fuller J.F. Wolf I. Liu Y. Lucas D.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 505-520PubMed Google Scholar). When translated, this Δ167 cDNA encodes a SHIP isoform of 108 kDa. These cDNAs, in the expression vector pBK-CMV (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), were transfected into 293T epithelial cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (13Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E. Su H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lysates from either 293T cells, transfected with various SHIP constructs or mock-transfected without DNA, or untreated FDC-P1 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described previously (22Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein sizes were estimated by comparison to Perfect Protein Markers (Novagen, Madison, WI). SHIP-deficient DT40 cells expressing the murine FcγRIIB1 have been previously described (30Aman M.J. Lamkin T.D. Okada H. Kurosaki T. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33922-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 107 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and transfected with 30 μg of linearized plasmid DNA at 250 volts and 960 microfarads in a Gene Pulser II electroporator (Bio-Rad). The plasmids used were pApuro-FL-SHIP and pApuro-SHIPβ (which use the actin promoter to drive expression of an hemagglutinin-tagged full-length SHIPα or the untagged SHIPβ, respectively). Grb2-deficient DT40 cells have been previously described (40Hashimoto A. Okada H. Jiang A. Kurosaki M. Greenberg S. Clark E.A. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1287-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 107 of these cells were transfected with 30 μg of linearized pApuro-FcγRIIB1 plasmid DNA as described above. Stable transfectants were selected in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Expression of SHIPα and SHIPβ proteins was determined by immunoblotting whole cell lysates with the anti-SHIP antibody P1C1. Surface expression of FcγRIIB1 was determined by flow cytometry (13Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E. Su H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indo-1-labeled DT40 cells were stimulated by cross-linking the BCR alone or BCR plus FcγRIIB1 as described previously. The ratio of indo-1 fluorescence at wavelengths of 398 and 480 nm after antibody addition was recorded using a Hitachi model 2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer and was plotted (13Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E. Su H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 cells/ml of SHIPα- or SHIPβ-expressing cells were stimulated and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40. After the cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation, 2× SDS-PAGE sample dye was added to the lysates, and the total cellular lysates were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the phosphospecific anti-MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs). The membrane was washed and subsequently immunoblotted with the rabbit anti-MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs). All blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). BCR-induced phosphorylation of Akt and the inhibition by BCR plus FcγRIIB1 cross-linking was monitored by immunoblotting anti-Akt immunoprecipitations after 10 min of stimulation using the anti-phospho-threonine308antibody (New England Biolabs) as described previously (41Carver D.J. Aman M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Blood. 2000; 96: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHIPα- and SHIPβ-expressing DT40 cells were stimulated via BCR plus FcγRIIB1, and Shc immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (13Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E. Su H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitations were separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Labs), anti-Shc (Santa Cruz Biotech), or anti-SHIP antibodies. SHIP immunoprecipitations were performed out of 108 DT40 cells expressing either SHIPα or SHIPβ using 10 μg of mAb P1C1. 20% of the immunoprecipitations were used for each time point in the phosphatase assay. Another 20% was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by anti-SHIP immunoblotting. SHIP immunoprecipitations were assayed for inositol phosphatase activity using 32P-radiolabeled PIP3 as a substrate as described previously (13Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E. Su H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly,32P-labeled PIP3 was generated using a constitutively active form of PI3K (p110*). A mixture of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylserine was suspended in kinase buffer and sonicated to generate micelles. This mixture was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and p110* for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA, and the lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1) and 1 m HCl. The organic solvent was dried, and the lipids were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.125% Nonidet P-40 by sonication and used as a substrate for the phosphatase assay. Beads from the SHIP immunoprecipitations were incubated with this substrate at 37 °C for 5, 15, or 35 min. The lipids were extracted, separated on a TLC plate, and visualized by autoradiography. To clarify references to the isoforms of SHIP at the protein level, we use the term SHIPα to describe p145 SHIP and SHIPβ for the p135 isoform (Fig.1 A). It has been previously shown that the SHIPβ protein is the product of the Δ183 SHIP mRNA (22Lucas D.M. Rohrschneider L.R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1922-1933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further demonstrate the identity of SHIPβ and to distinguish this band from an approximately 120–130 kDa band seen in some SHIP immunoblots, we generated"

https://openalex.org/W1490842825,"The primary olfactory organs of Drosophila, the third antennal segment and the maxillary palp, carry chemosensory bristles whose neurons project to glomeruli of the antennal lobe, analogous to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. In mammals, neurons expressing the same olfactory receptors converge onto the same glomerulus. Whether this is true for insects is unclear: although individual glomeruli in bees respond to specific odors, the molecular structure of the insect olfactory system had not been explored. Chess and colleagues (pages 780-785, this issue) now address this question by using transgenic flies in which a marker gene is driven by the regulatory sequences that normally control olfactory receptor gene expression. This allowed the authors to visualize the projections of individual olfactory neurons. Axons from neurons expressing a given olfactory receptor gene converged onto a small number of glomeruli, in a pattern that was invariant between individuals. This stereotypical wiring pattern presumably underlies the formation of an odotopic map in the antennal lobe. Given the power of Drosophila genetics, it should now be possible to determine how these connections are established and maintained."
