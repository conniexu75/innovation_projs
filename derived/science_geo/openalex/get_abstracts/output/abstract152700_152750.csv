https://openalex.org/W2080252952,"A hippocampal pyramidal neuron receives more than 10(4) excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Many of these synapses contain the molecular machinery for messenger RNA translation, suggesting that the protein complement (and thus function) of each synapse can be regulated on the basis of activity. Here, local postsynaptic protein synthesis, triggered by synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, was found to modify synaptic transmission within minutes."
https://openalex.org/W2140586775,"A high proportion of purebred Hampshire pigs carries the dominant RN- mutation, which causes high glycogen content in skeletal muscle. The mutation has beneficial effects on meat content but detrimental effects on processing yield. Here, it is shown that the mutation is a nonconservative substitution (R200Q) in the PRKAG3 gene, which encodes a muscle-specific isoform of the regulatory gamma subunit of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Loss-of-function mutations in the homologous gene in yeast (SNF4) cause defects in glucose metabolism, including glycogen storage. Further analysis of the PRKAG3 signaling pathway may provide insights into muscle physiology as well as the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in humans, a metabolic disorder associated with impaired glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2118361627,"The Class Bdelloidea of the Phylum Rotifera is the largest metazoan taxon in which males, hermaphrodites, and meiosis are unknown. We conducted a molecular genetic test of this indication that bdelloid rotifers may have evolved without sexual reproduction or genetic exchange. The test is based on the expectation that after millions of years without these processes, genomes will no longer contain pairs of closely similar haplotypes and instead will contain highly divergent descendants of formerly allelic nucleotide sequences. We find that genomes of individual bdelloid rotifers, representing four different species, appear to lack pairs of closely similar sequences and contain representatives of two ancient lineages that began to diverge before the bdelloid radiation many millions of years ago when sexual reproduction and genetic exchange may have ceased."
https://openalex.org/W2074043564,"The coalescence of single-walled nanotubes is studied in situ under electron irradiation at high temperature in a transmission electron microscope. The merging process is investigated at the atomic level, using tight-binding molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. Vacancies induce coalescence via a zipper-like mechanism, imposing a continuous reorganization of atoms on individual tube lattices along adjacent tubes. Other topological defects induce the polymerization of tubes. Coalescence seems to be restricted to tubes with the same chirality, explaining the low frequency of occurrence of this event."
https://openalex.org/W2082610063,"The nuclear receptor superfamily members of eukaryotic transcriptional regulators contain a highly conserved activation function 2 (AF2) in the hormone binding carboxyl-terminal domain and, for some, an additional activation function 1 in the NH2-terminal region which is not conserved. Recent biochemical and crystallographic studies revealed the molecular basis of AF2 is hormone-dependent recruitment of LXXLL motif-containing coactivators, including the p160 family, to a hydrophobic cleft in the ligand binding domain. Our previous studies demonstrated that AF2 in the androgen receptor (AR) binds only weakly to LXXLL motif-containing coactivators and instead mediates an androgen-dependent interaction with the AR NH2-terminal domain required for its physiological function. Here we demonstrate in a mammalian two-hybrid assay, glutathione S-transferase fusion protein binding studies, and functional assays that two predicted α-helical regions that are similar, but functionally distinct from the p160 coactivator interaction sequence, mediate the androgen-dependent, NH2- and carboxyl-terminal interaction. FXXLF in the AR NH2-terminal domain with the sequence23FQNLF27 mediates interaction with AF2 and is the predominant androgen-dependent interaction site. This FXXLF sequence and a second NH2-terminal WXXLF sequence 433WHTLF437 interact with different regions of the ligand binding domain to stabilize the hormone-receptor complex and may compete with AF2 recruitment of LXXLL motif-containing coactivators.

It has become apparent that the AF2 region overlaps with regions that serve as the binding site for a variety of LXXLL-related sequences as recently shown for corepressor binding (23Nagy L. Kao H.Y.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the AR AF2 region mediates an androgen-dependent NH2-terminal/carboxyl-terminal (N/C) interaction (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated the possibility that AF2 in the AR LBD interacts with an LXXLL-related sequence in the NH2-terminal domain. In this report, evidence is presented that sequences similar to but distinct from the LXXLL core sequence mediate a direct interaction between the NH2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of AR. The FXXLF core sequence 23FQNLF27 in the AR NH2-terminal domain binds AF2 in the carboxyl-terminal region in an androgen-dependent manner. In addition, a second motif in the NH2-terminal region WXXLF with the sequence 433WHTLF437 binds to a region of the LBD outside of AF2. Interaction of these NH2-terminal sequences with the LBD slows the dissociation rate of bound androgen. Sequence specificity was indicated since FXXLF could not be functionally replaced by an LXXLL core sequence. Mammalian two-hybrid N/C interaction assays were performed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as described previously (27Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

GALAR-(624–919) codes for a fusion protein of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL4 DNA binding domain residues 1–147 and AR LBD residues 624–919. Deletions within VPAR-(1–660) (Δ179–199, Δ394–405, and Δ429–439) were created by two polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers with appropriate deletions. The reporter vector G5E1bLuc contained five GAL4 DNA-binding sites and the luciferase reporter coding region (29Lillie J.W. Green M.R.

Cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as indicated and harvested in lysis buffer (Ligand Pharmaceuticals). Luciferase activity was determined using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego). For the assessment of AR transcriptional activity, monkey kidney CV1 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 (DMEM-H), and antibiotics were transiently transfected by plating 0.425 × 106 cells/6-cm dish. Wild-type and mutant pCMVhAR DNA (10–50 ng/dish) were precipitated with 5 μg of mouse mammary tumor virus promoter region (MMTV)-luciferase reporter vector (5 μg) using calcium phosphate (30Kemppainen J.A.

PCR mutagenesis was used to create single and double amino acid mutations in the23FXXLF27 and433WXXLF437 domains. L26A/F27AΔ339–499 was prepared by ligating pCMVhARΔ339–499 digested with BglII/AflII with the insert from pCMVhARL26A/F27A using the same enzymes. Apparent equilibrium binding affinity was determined in whole cell binding assays at 37 °C by plating monkey kidney COS1 cells (0.2 × 106/well of 12-well tissue culture plates) and transfecting 0.1 μg of pCMVhAR wild-type and mutant DNA using DEAE-dextran (26He B.

Twenty four h after transfection, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]R1881 from 0.1 to 5 nmin the presence and absence of a 100-fold excess unlabeled R1881. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, washed, and harvested in 0.5 ml of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For determination of dissociation rates of [3H]R1881, COS cells were plated at 0.4 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates and transfected with 2 μg of pCMVhAR DNA/well using DEAE-dextran. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 5 nm [3H]R1881 in the presence and absence of a 100-fold excess unlabeled R1881. Dissociation was started by the addition of 50 μm unlabeled R1881, and the cells were incubated for increasing times at 37 °C up to 3 h, washed once, and harvested in SDS buffer as described above, with radioactivity determined by scintillation counting. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion vectors GSTAR-(1–660) and GSTAR-(1–565) were prepared as described previously (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

GALAR-(1–660)-L26A/F27A was digested with BamHI/AflII, and the insert was ligated into pGEX-5X-1AR-(1–660) digested with BamHI/AflII to make GSTAR-(1–660)-L26A/F27A. GSTAR-(1–660)-L26A/F27A was digested with KpnI/AflII and ligated with the insert from VPAR-(1–660)-Δ429–439 digested with KpnI/AflII to make GSTAR-(1–660)-L26A/F27A-(Δ429–439). AR NH2-terminal residues 344–566 were PCR-amplified from VPAR-(1–660) with the appropriate deletions, digested at BamHI/XhoI primer sites, and ligated into pGEX-4T-1 to make GSTAR-(344–566), GSTAR-(344–566)-Δ339–381, GSTAR-(344–566)-Δ382–429, GSTAR-(344–566)-Δ430–499, and GSTAR-(344–566)-Δ429–439. GSTTIF2 expressing the central TIF2 amino acid residues 624–1141 containing three LXXLL motifs was described previously (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

GST fusion protein binding studies were performed essentially as described previously (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins with different regions of the human AR NH2-terminal region were expressed from XL1-Blue Escherichia coli cells treated with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h during log phase growth. Glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with sonicated bacterial supernatants containing the GST-AR fusion proteins. Beads were washed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris, pH 8.0, and combined with 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products)-labeled human AR LBD (AR amino acid residues 624–919) using TNT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C in the absence or presence of 0.2 μm DHT. Beads were washed, eluted with SDS, and analyzed on 12% acrylamide gels containing SDS. The androgen-dependent interaction between the AR NH2-terminal and carboxyl-terminal (N/C) domains occurs in the regions of predicted α-helices 3, 4, and 12 that comprise AF2 of the LBD, overlapping with the binding site for p160 coactivators (26He B.

Sequence analysis of the AR NH2-terminal regions previously implicated in the N/C interaction (27Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) revealed four predicted amphipathic α-helices that resemble LXXLL core sequences at residues 21–34, 351–359, 395–405, and 432–434 with another predicted outside these regions (33Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) at residues 177–201. We tested wild-type, deletion, and single amino acid mutations of these α-helical regions in a variety of assays. These included the mammalian two-hybrid N/C interaction assay performed in CHO cells and functional assays that included the effects of the mutations on [3H]androgen dissociation rate and transcriptional activation. In vitro domain interactions were also directly tested using E. coli-expressed GST fusion proteins. For the mammalian two-hybrid assay, wild-type and mutant VPAR-(1–660) coding for the AR NH2-terminal and DNA binding domains were cotransfected with GALAR-(624–919) expressing the LBD (Fig.1). Similar expression levels of wild-type and mutant VPAR-(1–660) vectors were verified by immunoblot analysis using AR52 antibody (data not shown). Also all of the VPAR-(1–660) constructs, when cotransfected with GALAR-(1–503) coding for just the NH2-terminal domain, resulted in 2.2–3.2-fold induction of luciferase activity indicative of the NH2-terminal/NH2-terminal AR interaction previously reported (27Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), thus confirming similar expression levels of the VPAR-(1–660) vectors. Wild-type and mutant VPAR-(1–660) coding for the AR NH2-terminal and DNA binding regions were coexpressed in the mammalian two-hybrid assay with GALAR-(624–919) coding for the AR LBD. The VPAR-(1–660) fragment with wild-type AR sequence induced 38 ± 19-fold luciferase activity relative to the no hormone control (Fig. 1). Deletion of NH2-terminal residues 179–199, 394–405, or 429–439 had no significant effect on the interaction (Fig. 1). In contrast, Δ9–28 reduced the interaction to only a 1.5-fold increase over the no hormone control and Δ339–499 to 10-fold relative to the control (Fig. 1) (27Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These results suggested interactions between the LBD and residues 9–28 and 339–499. Because23FQNLF27 lies within the 9–28 region and resembles the LXXLL core sequence, it was investigated further by mutagenesis. Changing phenylalanine 23 to alanine (F23A) or leucine 26 and phenylalanine 27 to alanine (L26A/F27A) reduced the N/C interaction to 1.6 ± 0.2-fold over background levels, whereas a flanking mutation of glutamine 28 to alanine (Q28A) resulted in an interaction similar to that of wild-type AR (Fig. 1). Changing both phenylalanine residues in 23FQNLF27 to leucine (F23L/F27L) to recreate a consensus LXXLL sequence resulted in only a 2-fold induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 1). These results indicated that an FXXLF motif was required in the N/C interaction. Specificity of the23FXXLF27 interaction with the AR LBD was indicated by the greatly reduced interaction when FXXLF was substituted by LXXLL. The requirement for the FXXLF motif in the N/C interaction was also investigated using AR NH2- and carboxyl-terminal fragments in transient transfection assays using the MMTV-luciferase reporter. As previously reported, the AR DNA binding and ligand binding domain fragment AR-(507–919) had negligible transcriptional activity in the presence of androgen (Fig. 2) indicative of the lack of AF2 transcriptional activity (32Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and weak recruitment of p160 coactivators by the AR AF2 region (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In cotransfection studies, wild-type NH2-terminal domain residues AR-(1–503) interacted with AR-(507–919) to stimulate an 18–28-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2). In contrast, NH2-terminal fragment AR-(1–503) with residues 14–150 deleted (Δ14–150) or with the mutated sequence22FQNAA27 (L26A/F27A) failed to interact with AR-(507–919), supporting an important role for23FQNLF27 in the N/C interaction. Androgen-induced luciferase activity was 6–12-fold with deletion of NH2-terminal residues 142–337 comprising the AR transactivation domain (Δ142–337) which could have resulted from reduced transactivation by AR rather than a decrease in the N/C interaction as previously suggested (27Langley E. Zhou Z. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29983-29990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Δ339–499 also reduced the interaction but less effectively than did the L26A/F27A mutation (Fig.2). The results support the requirement for23FQNLF27 in the N/C interaction and the presence of a second interaction site between residues 339 and 499. Similar results using fusion proteins of the AR NH2-terminal region linked to the VP16 transactivation domain supported the role of these two regions in the N/C interaction (Fig. 2). To establish a functional effect of the NH2-terminal mutations on AR activity and to obtain additional evidence for the putative second interacting site, we measured the androgen dissociation rate using the synthetic radiolabeled androgen [3H]R1881. These studies were based on previous studies that certain mutations in AF2 of the AR LBD cause androgen insensitivity by disrupting the N/C interaction. Although the equilibrium androgen binding affinity was unaffected by these mutations, the dissociation rate of bound androgen increased suggesting a corresponding increase in association rate (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The results supported a role for the N/C interaction in slowing the androgen dissociation rate in wild-type AR (31Zhou Z.X. Lane M.V. Kemppainen J.A. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 208-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence that the N/C interaction influences AR ligand binding kinetics is that coexpression of the DNA binding domain and LBD fragment AR-(507–919) with NH2-terminal fragment AR-(1–660) slows the dissociation of [3H]R1881 by 2-fold (28Langley E. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 92-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In contrast, no effect was seen by coexpression of the nuclear receptor coactivators transcriptional mediator/intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), vitamin D receptor-interacting protein 205, amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) or protein inhibitor of activated signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (PIAS1), each of which contains multiple consensus LXXLL motifs (10Rachez C.

Dissociation of [3H]R1881 from the carboxyl-terminal AR-(507–919) fragment (half-time of dissociation t½ of 43 ± 3 min, see Fig. 4) was unchanged with t½ of 42 ± 4 min at 37 °C when coexpressed with each of these coactivators (data not shown). The results are consistent with a weak interaction of these coactivators with the AR AF2 region compared with the interaction with the AR NH2-terminal domain (26He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and suggest a correspondingly higher apparent binding activity of the23FXXLF27 core sequence for AF2 compared with the LXXLL motif. The functional significance of the NH2-terminal FXXLF core sequence was also evident by increased dissociation rates of bound androgen with the introduction of mutations in the FXXLF region in full-length AR. Δ9–28, F23A, or L26A/F27A increased the dissociation rate of [3H]R1881 at 37 °C to t½ of 72–74 min compared with t½ of 144 ± 24 min for wild-type AR (Fig.3). In contrast, mutation of the flanking carboxyl glutamine (Q28A) had no effect on dissociation rate (t½ of 162 ± 24 min) (Fig. 3) or N/C interaction (Fig. 1). Furthermore, changing23FQNLF27 to the consensus LXXLL sequence (F23L/F27L) increased the dissociation rate from t½ of 144 ± 24 min for wild-type AR to t½ of 84 ± 9 min (Fig. 3), which was similar to t½ 74 ± 5 min for F23A and L26A/F27A, supporting that an LXXLL motif is much less effective than FXXLF in mediating the N/C interaction. None of these mutations or those described below changed significantly the apparent equilibrium binding affinity of [3H]R1881 that ranged from 0"

Finally, mutations in KCNQ4 cause autosomal dominant progressive hearing loss (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J.

Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Currents of KCNQ2/3 heteromers resemble M-currents (11Brown D.A. Adams P.R. Nature. 1980; 283: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) in their voltage dependence, kinetics, and sensitivity to inhibitors such as linopirdine and XE991 (10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). M-currents are defined by their electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics. These potassium currents are already present at the slightly depolarized potentials at the threshold of action potential firing and are highly regulated by several second messenger pathways (13Marrion N.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). M-currents are inhibited by the activation of muscarinic receptors (11Brown D.A. Adams P.R. Nature. 1980; 283: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 13Marrion N.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Brown D.A. Marrion N.V.

Since regulation of M-currents provides a means to set the firing rate of neurons, it is plausible that a loss of M-current leads to neuronal hyperexcitability and epilepsy in BFNC. Moderate changes in the magnitude of these currents may have profound effects. It was estimated from heterologous expression of channel mutants found in BFNC that a 25% loss of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current may suffice to cause epilepsy (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). As “M-currents” are defined by a rather broad set of biophysical and pharmacological characteristics, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits may not be the only molecular basis for these currents. Indeed,eag-related channels share some features with M-type currents, but opinions differ as to whether they really qualify as M-currents (16Stansfeld C. Ludwig J. Roeper J. Weseloh R. Brown D. Pongs O. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 13-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Marrion N.V.

Furthermore, the voltage and time dependence of KCNQ4 is similar to that of KCNQ2/3 channels, and KCNQ4 is also inhibited by blockers of M-currents such as linopirdine, albeit with lower efficiency (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The sensitivity to these inhibitors was increased in KCNQ3/4 heteromers, suggesting that channels containing KCNQ4 may underlie some forms of M-currents (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KCNQ4 is also inhibited by muscarinic stimulation (20Selyanko A.A. Hadley J.K. Wood I.C. Abogadie F.C. Jentsch T.J. Brwon D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 349-355Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast to KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, however, KCNQ4 plays an important role in hearing (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and its expression in the central nervous system is restricted to some areas of the brainstem. This includes nuclei and tracts of the auditory pathway (21Kharkovets T. Hardelin J.P. Safieddine S. Schweizer M. El-Amraoui A. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4333-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). A partial cDNA encoding a novel KCNQ channel fragment was isolated by screening a human thalamus cDNA library (CLONTECH) using a KCNQ3 cDNA as a probe. It was extended by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques using a Marathon kit (CLONTECH) of human adult brain cDNA. The KCNQ5 gene was localized on human chromosome spreads using fluorescent in situ hybridization by Genome Systems. The KCNQ5 cDNA (all splice variants of Fig.1 B) was cloned into pTPN, a derivative of the Xenopus oocyte expression vector pTLN (22Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) which contains an additional PacI site 3′ to the NruI site. After linearization with HpaI, capped cRNA was transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase in the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion).Xenopus oocytes were prepared by collagenase treatment, injected with 10 ng of cRNA, and incubated for 2–3 days at 17 °C. A dominant negative KCNQ5 mutant (G278S) and a KCNQ3 mutant (T323Y) were constructed by recombinant PCR. In some experiments, KCNQ5 (or the G278S mutant) was co-expressed at a 1:1 ratio with KCNQ2 or KCNQ3, or the respective dominant negative mutants KCNQ2(G279S) and KCNQ3(G318S) (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar), or the KCNQ3(T323Y) mutant using again a total cRNA amount of 10 ng per oocyte. The human M1 receptor cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from human fetal brain cDNA (CLONTECH) and was cloned into the pTPN vector. 10 and 5 ng of KCNQ5 and M1 receptor cDNAs, respectively, were co-injected into Xenopus oocytes. Conventional two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed at room temperature in ND96 saline (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) using a Turbotec (npi Instruments) amplifier and pClamp (Axon Instruments) software. For cation selectivity measurements, NaCl was replaced by equimolar amounts of the respective chloride salt. When using TEA-chloride, this inhibitor replaced equivalent amounts of NaCl. For experiments examining the effect of muscarinic receptor stimulation, 1.6 mmCa2+ was replaced by Mg2+ to reduce the activation of endogenous Ca2+-activated chloride channels. Tail current analysis was used to estimate apparentP open (Fig. 4). From a holding potential of −80 mV, oocytes were clamped to values between −100 and + 40 mV for 2 s. Since variant III does not reach steady-state activation even after more than 10 s, the parameters obtained for this splice form do not reflect steady-state values. Tail currents were measured at −30 mV by extrapolating to the time when the voltage was changed. Since channel gating is slow compared with the voltage jump, these currents are proportional to the number of channels that are open at the prepulse voltage. Multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH human 7760-1, human brain II 7755-1, and human brain III 7750-1) were hybridized overnight at 68 °C in 7% SDS, 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, 1.5× SSPE (SSPE, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA with a 32P-labeledAflIII/EcoRI fragment of pTPN-KCNQ5 that covers the last 1.1 kilobase pairs of the open reading frame. Blots were washed three times for 40 min in 0,1% SDS in 0.1× SSC (SSC, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 50 °C and exposed on X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). mRNA was isolated from the NG108-15 cell line using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) Dynabeads (Dynal), and 1.8 μg per lane were separated on a gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N membrane and probed with a human KCNQ3 and a rat KCNQ5 probe. For the in situ hybridization of rat brain sections, a 1.1-kilobase pair rat KCNQ5 fragment (obtained by PCR and covering the equivalent region of 170–1290 base pairs of human KCNQ5) was subcloned into pBluescript, and radioactive sense and antisense cRNAs were transcribed (Maxiscript, Ambion) using T3 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively, and hydrolyzed to roughly 200–300-base pair fragments. In situ hybridization was performed as described (23Hartmann D. Fehr S. Meyerhof W. Richter D. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The rat brain sections were exposed to film, and the rat superior cervical ganglion section was dipped in a photoemulsion. By homology screening of a human brain cDNA library with KCNQ3, we isolated a novel member of the KCNQ gene family that we named KCNQ5 (Fig. 1). It encodes a protein of 897 amino acids that has a predicted molecular mass of ∼99 kDa. It has six transmembrane domains, a P-loop, and a carboxyl-terminal conserved cytoplasmic region (the “A-domain”) (24Schwake M. Pusch M. Kharkovets T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Similar to other KCNQ channel cDNAs (3Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K.

Most of our functional studies were performed with variant I, which we had isolated from brain. By using fluorescent in situ hybridization of human metaphase cells, the KCNQ5 gene was localized to the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q14). Northern analysis revealed thatKCNQ5 is mainly expressed in brain and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 A). Its mRNA is present in many regions of the human brain, including the cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal and temporal lobes, putamen, and the hippocampus (Fig. 2 B). In these regions, it is co-expressed with KCNQ2 (3Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K.

In addition, it revealed significant expression in the piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the pontine medulla, and the facial nucleus. In apparent contrast to the human Northern analysis (Fig. 2 B), there was also a faint signal in the rat cerebellum (Fig. 3 A). A weak expression in the rat cerebellum was subsequently confirmed by Northern analysis (data not shown).Figure 3In situ hybridization of adult rat brain sections (A) and a rat superior cervical ganglion (C).

Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) to express both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. In situ hybridization revealed that this ganglion also expresses KCNQ5 (Fig. 3 C). A system frequently used to study neuronal M-currents is the NG108-15 mouse neuroblastoma × rat glioma cell line. These cells were recently shown to co-express KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 (18Selyanko A.A.

Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Northern analysis revealed that these cells also express KCNQ5 (Fig. 2 C). Thus, this cell type expresses all three subunits. We expressed the three splice variants of KCNQ5 (Fig. 1 B) in Xenopus oocytes and investigated the associated currents by two-electrode voltage clamping. Since there were no conspicuous differences between variants I and II, we focused on variants I and III that we had isolated from brain and skeletal muscle, respectively. Both forms of KCNQ5 yielded currents that needed several seconds to activate fully upon depolarization (Fig. 4, A and B). This activation was faster than with KCNQ4 (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C.

Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) but slower than with KCNQ2 (3Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 7 B) and in particular KCNQ1 (30Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 31Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Interestingly, gating kinetics differed markedly between both splice forms. The muscle isoform III showed a faster initial activation but did not reach steady-state activation even after 10 s. By contrast, the brain isoform I initially activated more slowly but reached steady-state after 2–3 s (for time constants, see legend to Fig. 4). This difference in gating kinetics is also apparent when a typical M-current voltage clamp protocol is employed. Although the brain variant yields currents that kinetically resemble M-currents (Fig. 4 C), the muscle variant III does not show the typical current relaxations after hyperpolarizing voltage steps (Fig. 4 D). Tail current analysis was used to estimate activation parameters. Both variants begin to activate at voltages around −60 mV and show a decrease in apparent P open at voltages more positive than approximately +20 mV (Fig. 4, E and F). This may be due to an inactivation process at positive voltages as observed, e.g. with KCNQ1 (32Pusch M. Magrassi R. Wollnik B. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Tristani-Firouzi M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 510: 37-45Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The apparent half-maximal activation did not show a large difference between these isoforms (V½ ∼ −46 ± 1 mV and V½ ∼ −48 ± 1 mV for isoforms I and III, respectively). This is more negative than with KCNQ4 (V½ ∼ −10 mV) (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 437-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), but it is in the same range as values for KCNQ2 (V½ ∼ −37 mV) (3Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K. Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and KCNQ2/3 heteromers (V½ ∼ −40 mV) (10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). It fits nicely with values measured for native M-currents in cervical sympathetic ganglion cells (V½ ∼ −45 mV) (10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Ion substitution experiments (Fig. 4 G) revealed that KCNQ5 currents (isoform I) are highly selective for potassium. Other experiments (not shown) yielded a Rb+ ∼ K+ > Cs+ > Na+ selectivity sequence. We studied the pharmacology of KCNQ5 using the brain variant I (Fig.5). Tetraethylammonium (TEA) was a poor inhibitor with an IC50 of about 70 mm (Fig.5 A), whereas barium was more effective (>60% inhibition at 1 mm and 0 mV; data not shown). Linopirdine and XE991, which are rather specific inhibitors of M-type currents (10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D.

Rominger D.H. Earl R.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 724-730PubMed Google Scholar), were much more potent and inhibited KCNQ5 with an IC50in the 50–70 μm range (Fig. 5 A). This is higher than the values reported for KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromers (linopirdine, 4 μm; XE991, 0.6 μm) (10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). When comparing these results to native M-currents, however, one should bear in mind that oocyte-expressed channels may differ in their sensitivity to inhibitors. Additionally, we identified niflumic acid as an activator of KCNQ5 currents. At 0.5 mm, it shifted the apparent P open by approximately 20 mV to negative voltages (Fig. 5 B). This resembles effects of niflumic acid on IsK channels (36Busch A.E. Herzer T. Wagner C.A. Schmidt F. Raber G. Waldegger S. Lang F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 750-753PubMed Google Scholar), which are heteromers of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (30Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 31Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). We also co-expressed KCNQ5 with several β-subunits of the KCNE gene family. When we expressed KCNQ5 (variant I) with KCNE1 (minK, IsK) (37Takumi T. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Science. 1988; 242: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) at levels that drastically activate and slow KCNQ1 currents (30Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar, 31Barhanin J. Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Nature. 1996; 384: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar), we observed a reduction in the magnitude of these currents that also activated slightly slower (data not shown). The kinetic effect, however, might be explained by a superposition with a current formed by KCNE1 with xKCNQ1 which is endogenous to Xenopus oocytes (30Sanguinetti M.C. Curran M.E. Zou A. Shen J. Spector P.S. Atkinson D.L. Keating M.T. Nature. 1996; 384: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Since KCNE1 could not be detected in brain and skeletal muscle by Northern analysis (38Chouabe C. Neyroud N. Guicheney P. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5472-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), an interaction with KCNQ5 is unlikely to be of physiological relevance. KCNE2 (Mirp1) (39Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I.

Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), which shows significant expression in skeletal muscle, led to a slightly faster activation of KCNQ5 (muscle variant III). KCNE3 (39Abbott G.W. Sesti F. Splawski I. Buck M.E. Lehmann M.H. Timothy K.W. Keating M.T. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 175-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar,40Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), which interacts with KCNQ1 to form constitutively open channels (40Schroeder B.C. Waldegger S. Fehr S. Bleich M. Warth R. Greger R. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), also suppressed KCNQ5 (variant I) currents in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The lack of drastic effects on channel properties, however, raises doubts on the physiological significance of these findings. One of the defining features of M-currents is their inhibition via muscarinic receptors. We therefore co-injected Xenopus oocytes with cRNAs encoding KCNQ5 and the M1 muscarinic receptor, respectively. Muscarinic stimulation led to a transient activation of Ca2+-activated chloride currents that are endogenous to Xenopus oocytes. KCNQ5 currents were measured before muscarinic stimulation and more than 2 min after stimulating M1 receptors with either 10 μm muscarine or oxotremorine methiodide. After this time, the Ca2+-activated chloride currents had largely disappeared due to desensitization processes. KCNQ5 currents were inhibited typically by more than 80% after M1 receptor stimulation (Fig. 6). Thus, KCNQ5 also shares this type of regulation with neuronal M-currents. As several KCNQ subunits can assemble to form heteromeric channels (6Kubisch C. Schroeder B.C. Friedrich T. Lütjohann B. El-Amraoui A. Marlin S. Petit C. Jentsch T.J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), we investigated whether KCNQ5 can assemble with KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 with which it is co-expressed in many regions of the brain and in sympathetic ganglia. We co-expressed KCNQ2 with KCNQ5 using constant total amounts of cRNA but different ratios of cRNA concentrations to allow for different stoichiometries of channel assembly. In none of these co-injection experiments did the magnitude of currents significantly differ from those elicited by either homomeric KCNQ2 or KCNQ5 channels (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, the kinetic properties of currents could not be distinguished from a linear superposition of both currents (Fig.7 B). This is in contrast to the large current increase upon co-expression of KCNQ2 with KCNQ3 (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9Yang W.P. Levesque P.C. Little W.A. Conder M.L. Ramakrishnan P. Neubauer M.G. Blanar M.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). As a further test, we co-expressed KCNQ5 with a dominant negative mutant of KCNQ2 (G279S) (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and also WT KCNQ2 with the equivalent mutant of KCNQ5 (G278S). When expressed by themselves, these mutants did not yield currents. The currents resulting from these co-expression experiments were approximately 50% of WT KCNQ5 or KCNQ2 currents (Fig. 7 A). This current level would be expected in the absence of an interaction because 50% of WT RNA was injected to keep the total amount of cRNA constant. Kinetic analysis revealed that currents of oocytes co-injected with KCNQ2 and KCNQ5(G278S) activated like KCNQ2 currents and that KCNQ2(G279S)/KCNQ5 injected oocytes gave currents that kinetically resembled KCNQ5 currents (Fig. 7 B). This suggests that either these subunits do not interact or that the (presumably tetrameric) channels containing one or more mutated subunits do not yield currents. In the latter case, however, the current observed after a 1:1 co-expression of WT and mutant subunits should be reduced to less than 10% of WT if the subunits do not show any preference in assembly. Since this is not the case (Fig. 7 A), it is concluded that KCNQ2 and KCNQ5 do not interact strongly. Similar tests were applied to study a possible KCNQ3-KCNQ5 interaction (Fig. 7 C). KCNQ3 by itself yields currents that are barely above background in Xenopus oocytes (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). When co-expressed with KCNQ5, KCNQ3 increased currents (by a factor of >2) when co-injected at a low KCNQ3/KCNQ5 ratio. However, it led to a decrease in currents when present at higher ratios (Fig.7 C). The dominant negative KCNQ3 mutant G318S (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) significantly suppressed KCNQ5 currents. These experiments suggest that KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 form heteromers. A still more stringent test was performed by exploiting the differential sensitivity of heteromers to inhibition by TEA. KCNQ5 is poorly inhibited by TEA (Fig. 5, A and C). This is consistent (41Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) with the absence of a tyrosine residue at position 283 following the highly conserved GYGDK sequence in the P-loop (Fig.1 A). Indeed, KCNQ2, which has a tyrosine at that position, is more sensitive to TEA, whereas KCNQ3, which lacks this tyrosine, is rather insensitive (IC50 = 224 mm) (10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 42Shapiro M.S. Roche J.P. Kaftan E.J. Cruzblanca H. Macjie K. Hille B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1710-1721Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 were co-injected, the sensitivity to TEA was decreased (Fig. 5 C), again indicating the formation of heteromeric channels. To support this result further, we generated a mutant of KCNQ3 in which the threonine at position 323 was replaced by tyrosine (T323Y). This mutant is expected to be more sensitive to TEA. However, and probably related to the fact that even WT KCNQ3 expresses poorly in Xenopus oocytes (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), we could not detect currents from KCNQ3(T323Y). Work on other potassium channels indicated that the affinity of the blocker TEA increases with the number of tyrosines at this position within the tetrameric channel (41Heginbotham L. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1992; 8: 483-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Thus, one would expect that KCNQ3(T323Y)/KCNQ5 heteromers are more sensitive to TEA than are the corresponding WT heteromers, and this is indeed the case (Fig. 5 C). Importantly, these experiments show a change in intrinsic properties of channels by a point mutation which do not depend on the level of surface expression. Since KCNQ3 yields only very small currents in oocytes, and because KCNQ3(T323Y) does not give currents by itself, this unambiguously demonstrates the formation of KCNQ3/5 heteromeric channels. As KCNQ5 is co-expressed with both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in many brain regions, we also co-expressed all three subunits at 1:1:1 cRNA ratio in oocytes. Currents could not be distinguished from a superposition of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 with KCNQ3/KCNQ5 currents (data not shown). Our work suggests that KCNQ5, in addition to KCNQ2 and KCNQ3, contributes to M-type potassium currents in broad regions of the brain and in sympathetic neurons. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 co-expression yields currents that are at least 10-fold larger than those of KCNQ2 (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 10Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). By contrast, KCNQ5 will lead to a more moderate increase in M-currents when co-expressed with KCNQ3 but may either increase or decrease currents when co-expressed with both KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in the same cell. This is because the amount of KCNQ3 available to form the more “efficient” KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromers is reduced by binding to KCNQ5. Thus, in addition to forming a novel M-type current by itself or together with KCNQ3, KCNQ5 may also down-regulate the number of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromers. Since all three KCNQ subunits are broadly, but differentially, expressed in brain, there will be various types of M-type currents in different neuron populations. Furthermore, different M-type channels may be expressed within single neurons. This will clearly be the case for NG108-15 cells, which have been used as a model system to study M-currents and which co-express KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and KCNQ5. KCNQ5 is also prominently expressed in human skeletal muscle (Fig.2 A). This is also true for the rat, in which Northern analysis revealed KCNQ5 expression in that tissue, but probably at lower levels (data not shown). The function of KCNQ5 in skeletal muscle is presently unclear. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of M-type currents in that tissue. Given the kinetic properties of the skeletal muscle splice variant III, which does not yield “M-type” gating kinetics in typical voltage clamp protocols (Fig.4 D), this may not be surprising. One report stated that linopirdine (215 μm) increased the twitch tension of mouse diaphragm muscle upon direct electrical stimulation (43Tsai M.C. Su J.L. Chen M.L. Fan S.Z. Cheng C.Y. Neuropharmacology. 1992; 31: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism is not clear, one might speculate that this is due to the inhibition of muscular KCNQ5 channels. Mutations in either KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 lead to BFNC, a neonatal human epilepsy (3Biervert C. Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Berkovic S.F. Propping P. Jentsch T.J. Steinlein O.K.

Mutations underlying this disorder (which include KCNQ2 gene deletions on one allele) (5Singh N.A. Charlier C. Stauffer D. DuPont B.R. Leach R.J. Melis R. Ronen G.M. Bjerre I. Quattlebaum T.

Science. 1998; 279: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The predicted loss of KCNQ2/KCNQ3 current is small (7Schroeder B.C. Kubisch C. Stein V. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations in KCNQ5 on neuronal excitability are more difficult to predict and will depend on the relative expression levels of these subunits. In cells expressing only KCNQ5, or in cells expressing KCNQ5 and KCNQ3, a loss of KCNQ5 function would entail an increase in excitability that could lead to epilepsy. The situation is more complex in neurons expressing KCNQ2, -3, and -5, since KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels yield larger macroscopic currents than do KCNQ3/KCNQ5 heteromers. Thus, depending on the particular situation, a loss of KCNQ5 function could lead to either an increase or a decrease in M-current magnitude. On the other hand, certain types of KCNQ5 mutations (e.g. dominant negative ones) could reduce overall M-type currents in neurons co-expressing all three subunits independent of their relative expression levels. Thus, KCNQ5 may be a good candidate gene for epileptic disorders, even though no epilepsy locus has been assigned so far to human chromosome 6q14 where KCNQ5 maps. In addition, since M-current activators may be useful for treating epilepsy, and because drugs inhibiting M-currents may be useful for treating the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (12Costa A.M.

Formation and maintenance of mature FDCs require the presence of B cells expressing membrane-bound lymphotoxin-alpha/beta. Treatment of mice with soluble lymphotoxin-beta receptor results in the disappearance of mature FDCs from the spleen. We show that this treatment abolishes splenic prion accumulation and retards neuroinvasion after intraperitoneal scrapie inoculation. These data provide evidence that FDCs are the principal sites for prion replication in the spleen."

The PKC isoforms have been subdivided into: (i) the conventional PKCs (cPKCs; α, β, γ), which are dependent on calcium and activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA); (ii) the novel PKCs (nPKCs; δ, ε, θ, η), which are calcium-independent and activated by DAG or TPA; and (iii) the atypical PKCs (aPKCs; ζ, λ) which are calcium-independent and not activated by DAG or TPA (1.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). The cPKCs are cleaved in the third variable region by calpains I and II to catalytically active fragments (2.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Other studies (2.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the nPKC, PKCδ, is cleaved in the third variable region by caspase 3 in the apoptotic response of cells to DNA damage and engagement of the tumor necrosis factor receptor. The cleaved catalytic fragment of PKCδ is constitutively activated and, when overexpressed in HeLa and other cells, is sufficient to induce apoptosis (3.Ghayur T. Hugunin M. Talanian R.V. Ratnofsky S. Quinlan C. Emoto Y. Pandey P. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Allen H. Kamen R. Wong W. Kufe D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activation of PKCδ has also been implicated in ultraviolet radiation-induced apoptosis of keratinocytes (4.Denning M. Wang Y. Brian J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These findings have supported a role for the PKCδ isoform in the apoptotic response of cells to diverse stimuli. The treatment of human myeloid leukemia cells with TPA is associated with the induction of apoptosis (5.Gunji H. Hass R. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that TPA induces apoptosis of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells and Jurkat T cells (6.de Vente J. Killey S. Garris T. Bryant W. Hooker J. Posekany K. Parker P. Cook P. Fletcher D. Ways D. Cell Growth Diff. 1995; 6: 371-382PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Chen C. Faller D. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that TPA-induced activation of certain PKC isoforms confers signals that induce apoptosis. However, the identity of the PKC isoform(s) that are activated in TPA-induced apoptosis and the downstream signals that confer the apoptotic response are unknown. The available evidence indicates that at least two pathways induce apoptosis in the cellular response to other stimuli. One pathway is initiated by engagement of the tumor necrosis factor or Fas receptors and thereby activation of caspase 8 (8.Martin D. Siegel R. Zheng L. Lenardo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 9.Hu S. Vincenz C. Ni J. Gentz R. Dixit V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In turn, caspase 8 cleaves Bid and induces cytochromec release (10.Luo X. Budihardjo H. Zou H. Slauhter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 11.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6259) Google Scholar). Caspase 8 can also directly activate caspase 3 (12.Stennicke H. Jurgenmeier J. Shin H. Deveraux B. Wolf X. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H. Ellerby L. Bredesen D. Green D. Reed J. Froelich C. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, other signals, which importantly remain undefined, converge to induce the release of cytochromec (13.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 14.Cecconi F. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, induces the autoprocessing of caspase 9 and thereby the activation of caspase 3 (11.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6259) Google Scholar, 15.Zou H. Li X. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Neither of these pathways has been linked to TPA-induced apoptosis. The present studies demonstrate that TPA treatment is associated with the translocation of cytoplasmic PKCδ to mitochondria. The results show that translocation of PKCδ induces the release of cytochromec and the activation of caspase 3. These findings support a novel mechanism for TPA-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Human U-937 myeloid leukemia cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. MCF-7, MCF-7/neo, MCF-7/PKCδRD, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (3 × 106/150-mm culture dish) were plated 24 h before treating with 250 nm TPA (Sigma), 100 nm bryostatin 1 (ICN, Aurora, OH), 10 μm1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG; Calbiochem) and 0.5 unit/ml phospholipase C (PLC; Sigma). Cells were also treated with 10 μm rottlerin (Calbiochem). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), homogenized in buffer A (210 mm manitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mmHEPES, 1 mm EGTA) and 110 μg/μl digitonin in a glass homogenizer (Pyrex no. 7727-07) and centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A, homogenized in a small glass homogenizer (Pyrex no. 7726), and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min. Supernatant (S1) was collected and the pellet again homogenized in buffer A. Supernatant (S2) was collected after centrifugation at 2000 × gfor 5 min. Supernatants S1 and S2 were mixed and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial pellets were disrupted in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The concentration of mitochondrial proteins in the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad protein estimation kit. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and the pellet was suspended in 5 ml of ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) containing 250 mm sucrose. The cells were homogenized by disrupting three times in a Dounce homogenizer in buffer B. After centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants then were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was used as the soluble cytosolic fraction. Total, cytoplasmic or mitochondrial lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP, anti-PKCγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-PKCμ (Santa Cruz), anti-PKCζ (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-PKCθ (Santa Cruz), anti-PKCη (Santa Cruz), anti-PKCε (Santa Cruz), or anti-PKCδ (Santa Cruz) antibodies. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The residual binding sites were blocked by incubating the filters with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). The filters were incubated with anti-PKCδ, anti-cytochromec (16.Kirken R. Lincoln A. Fink P. Prochaska L. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), anti-Hsp-60 (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), anti-actin (Sigma), anti-PKCγ, anti-PKCμ, anti-PKCζ, or anti-GFP (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After washing twice with PBST, the filters were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate and developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). pEGFP-PKCδ and PKCδ-RD were prepared as described previously (17.Kumar V. Pandey P. Sabatini D. Kumar M. Majumder P. Bharti A. Carmichael G. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-PKCδ(K378R) mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. 293T cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (pEGFP-C1), pEGFP-PKCδ, or pEGFP-PKCδ (K378R) using SuperFect (Qiagen). At 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-PKCδ and anti-GFP. Signal intensities were determined by densitometric analysis. Cells immobilized on slides were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated with 20 ng of anti-PKCδ/slide and then Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc). Mitochondria were stained with 0.006 ng/slide of Mitotracker Green FM (Molecular Probes). The slides were analyzed using a Zeiss Auxiphot fluorescence microscope coupled to a CCD camera and a power Macintosh 8100. Image analysis was performed using the IPLab Spectrum 3.1 software (Signal Analytics). 293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP-PKCδ or GFP-PKCδ(K-R). Total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCδ, anti-PKCθ, anti-PKCε, anti-PKCη, anti-PKCμ, or anti-PKCζ. The immune complex kinase assays were performed using H1 histone as a substrate as described previously (18.Sun X. Wu F. Datta R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7470-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 80% ethanol. Cells (106 cells/ml) were washed and incubated with propidium iodide (2.5 μg/ml) and RNase (50 μg/ml). FACScan (Becton Dickinson) was used to assess cells with sub-G1 DNA content. PKC isoforms regulate diverse cellular processes but are not known as effectors of mitochondria (1.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3535) Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC regulates mitochondrial function, human U-937 cells were treated with TPA to activate PKC. PKC translocation was assessed by subjecting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions to immunoblotting with anti-PKC antibodies. The results demonstrate that TPA treatment is associated with decreases in cytoplasmic PKCδ and concomitant increases in mitochondrial PKCδ (Fig. 1 A). As controls, the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions were also subjected to immunoblotting with anti-actin and anti-Hsp60 to ensure purity of the preparations (Fig. 1 A). By contrast to translocation of PKCδ, TPA had no detectable effect on cytoplasmic or mitochondrial levels of PKCγ and PKCζ (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). The immunoblots were scanned to calculate percent PKCδ translocation to mitochondria. The results demonstrate that approximately 40% of PKCδ translocates to mitochondria in response to TPA. The demonstration that PKCδ also translocates to mitochondria in TPA-treated MCF-7 cells indicates that the finding is not restricted to certain cell types (Fig. 2 A). In addition, to confirm the subcellular redistribution of PKCδ in TPA-treated cells, we visualized intracellular fluorescence with a CCD camera and image analyzer. Examination of fluorescence markers in control cells showed distinct patterns for anti-PKCδ (red signal) and a mitochondrion-selective dye (Mitotracker; green signal) (Fig. 2 B). The demonstration that TPA induces a marked change in fluorescence signals (red and green →yellow/orange) supported translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria (Fig. 2 B). These findings obtained by immunofluorescence microscopy thus confirm the results of PKCδ redistribution found by subcellular fractionation. To determine whether the natural product bryostatin, which activates PKC (19.Stone R.M. Sariban E. Pettit G.R. Kufe D.W. Blood. 1988; 72: 208-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also induces the translocation of PKCδ, mitochondrial lysates from U-937 cells treated with 100 nm bryostatin were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ. As a control, mitochondrial lysates were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCζ. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to PKCζ, treatment with bryostatin was associated with translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria (Fig. 3 A). PLC is activated by cell membrane-initiated signaling pathways and, by conferring the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol or phosphatidylcholine, results in the formation of DAG (20.Berridge M. Irvine R. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). To determine whether PLC induces the translocation of PKCδ, mitochondrial lysates from U-937 cells treated with 0.5 unit/ml PLC were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ. The results demonstrate that treatment with PLC is associated with translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria (Fig. 3 B). To confirm the involvement of DAG in mitochondrial translocation of PKCδ, cells were treated with a cell permeable-DAG (DOG) (21.Ferro T. Parker D. Commins L. Phillips P. Johnson A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L7-L14PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of DOG-treated cell lysates demonstrated that DOG induced the translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria (Fig. 3 C). These findings indicate that, like TPA, treatment with bryostatin, PLC, and DOG is associated with redistribution of cytosolic PKCδ to mitochondria. To determine whether activation of PKCδ is required for translocation to mitochondria, we transfected cells with a vector expressing GFP-tagged PKCδ. Immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP demonstrated no detectable PKCδ in the mitochondrial fraction from cells transfected with an empty GFP vector (Fig.4 A). By contrast, transfection of kinase-active GFP-PKCδ was associated with PKCδ expression in mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, treatment of the GFP-PKCδ-transfected cells with TPA resulted in further increases in levels of mitochondrial PKCδ (Fig. 4 A). Significantly, transfection of kinase-inactive GFP-PKCδ(K-R) had no effect on expression of mitochondrial PKCδ (Fig. 4 A). In addition, overexpression of GFP-PKCδ(K-R) blocked the TPA-induced translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). To demonstrate that PKCδ(K-R) specifically blocks endogenous PKCδ activity, and not that of other isoforms of PKC, 293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP-PKCδ or GFP-PKCδ(K-R). Following transfection, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKCδ, anti-PKCμ, anti-PKCζ, anti-PKCθ, anti-PKCη, or anti-PKCε. The precipitates were assayed in in vitro kinase assays using H1 histone as substrate. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to PKCμ, PKCζ, PKCθ, or PKCη, overexpression of PKCδ(K-R) specifically inhibits the activity of endogenous PKCδ (Fig.4 B). Of note, the results also indicate that overexpression of PKCδ(K-R) is associated with slight inhibition of the phosphorylated and active PKCε (Fig. 4 B). PKCδ consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain (RD) and a C-terminal catalytically active fragment (2.Emoto Y. Manome G. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells stably transfected to express the 35-kDa RD exhibit attenuation of TPA-induced PKCδ activity. 2P. K. Majumder, P. Pandey, X. Sun, K. Cheng, R. Datta, S. Saxena, S. Kharbanda, and D. Kufe, unpublished data. Translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria was also attenuated in TPA-treated MCF-7/PKCδRD cells as compared with that in MCF-7 cells expressing the empty neo vector (Fig.5 A). Other studies were performed with rottlerin, a selective inhibitor of PKCδ activation (22.Reyland M. Anderson S. Matassa A. Barzen K. Quissell D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19115-19123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Treatment of U-937 cells with rottlerin abrogated TPA-induced localization of PKCδ to mitochondria (Fig. 5 B). These findings collectively demonstrate that PKCδ activation is necessary for its translocation to mitochondria.Figure 5A, MCF-7/neo and MCF-7/PKCδRD cells were treated with TPA for the indicated times. Mitochondrial lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ. B, U-937 cells were treated with TPA for 1 h or 10 μmrottlerin (ROT) for 1.5 h. Cells were also treated with rottlerin for 0.5 h before adding TPA for an additional 1 h (ROT/TPA). Mitochondrial lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The potential role of PKCδ translocation was explored by assessing mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Whereas diverse apoptotic signals induce cytochrome c release, phorbol ester treatment of cells has not been associated with this event. Immunoblot analysis of cytoplasmic fractions with anti-cytochrome cdemonstrated that TPA treatment of U-937 cells is associated with cytochrome c release (Fig.6 A). Similar results were obtained when U-937 cells were treated with PLC or DOG (Fig. 6,B and C). To determine whether PKCδ functions in inducing cytochrome c release, we pretreated U-937 cells with rottlerin before adding TPA. Of note, treatment of cells with rottlerin alone is associated with cytotoxic effects that contribute to a detectable release of cytochrome c (Fig.7 A). By contrast, analysis of cytoplasmic lysates demonstrated that rottlerin significantly blocks TPA-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 7 A). As these findings indicate that the PKCδ kinase function is required for TPA-induced release of cytochrome c, 293T cells were transfected to express GFP, GFP-PKCδ, or GFP-PKCδ(K-R) and then treated with TPA. Immunoblotting of the cytoplasmic fraction from GFP positive cells demonstrated abrogation of TPA-induced cytochromec release in cells expressing PKCδ(K-R) compared with that in cells transfected with the GFP-PKCδ vector (Fig. 7 B). Taken together, these results and those obtained for PKCδ translocation support a role for PKCδ in the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c.Figure 7A, U-937 cells were treated with TPA for 6 h or rottlerin (ROT) for 6.5 h. Cells were also treated with rottlerin for 0.5 h before adding TPA for an additional 6 h (ROT/TPA). Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c(upper panel). Signal intensities from the anti-cytochromec immunoblotting experiments described in the upper panel were analyzed by densitometric scanning. The signal intensities are expressed in arbitrary value as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments (lower panel).B, 293T cells were transiently transfected to express empty vector, PKCδ or PKCδ(K-R). After 24 h, the cells were treated with TPA for 3 h. Cytosolic lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cytochrome c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria triggers activation of caspases and induction of apoptosis (23.Liu X. Kim C. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar). To determine whether TPA-induced PKCδ translocation and thereby cytochromec release contributes to apoptosis, U-937 cells treated with rottlerin and TPA were assayed for sub-G1 DNA content. The results demonstrate that treatment with rottlerin alone induces a low level of apoptosis (Fig. 8 A). By contrast, the apoptotic response of U-937 cells to TPA was significantly attenuated by inhibition of PKCδ with rottlerin (Fig.8 A). Moreover, treatment of MCF-7/neo cells with TPA was also associated with the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 8 B). By contrast, the apoptotic response to TPA was significantly attenuated in MCF-7/PKCδRD cells (Fig. 8 B). Taken together with our other findings, these results support a role for TPA-induced localization of PKCδ to mitochondria and in the induction of apoptosis. Previous work has demonstrated that TPA treatment is associated with translocation of PKCδ to the cell membrane (24.Ohmori S. Shirai Y. Sakai N. Fujji M. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Saito N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5263-5271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies demonstrate that TPA treatment of diverse cell types is associated with translocation of PKCδ to mitochondria. These findings have been confirmed by cell fractionation and immunofluorescence studies. The results further demonstrate that the PKCδ kinase function is necessary for TPA-induced mitochondrial localization. The functional significance of PKCδ translocation to mitochondria is supported by the finding that this event is linked to mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. Moreover, the results demonstrate that abrogation of PKCδ translocation to mitochondria significantly inhibits TPA-induced apoptosis. These findings thus support a model in which TPA induces the release of cytochrome c and thereby apoptosis by a PKCδ-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2006362364,"A comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering study of magnetic excitations in the near optimally doped high-temperature superconductor YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6.85) is presented. The spin correlations in the normal state are commensurate with the crystal lattice, and the intensity is peaked around the wave vector characterizing the antiferromagnetic state of the insulating precursor, YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6). Profound modifications of the spin excitation spectrum appear abruptly below the superconducting transition temperature T(c), where a commensurate resonant mode and a set of weaker incommensurate peaks develop. The data are consistent with models that are based on an underlying two-dimensional Fermi surface, predicting a continuous, downward dispersion relation connecting the resonant mode and the incommensurate excitations. The magnetic incommensurability in the YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+)(x) system is thus not simply related to that of another high-temperature superconductor, La(2-)(x)Sr(x)CuO(4), where incommensurate peaks persist well above T(c). The temperature-dependent incommensurability is difficult to reconcile with interpretations based on charge stripe formation in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(6+x) near optimum doping."

Flow visualizations show that the near-wall streaks are eliminated, in contrast to other turbulence-control techniques, leading to a large shear stress reduction. The traveling wave can be induced by a spanwise force that is confined within the viscous sublayer; it has its maximum at the wall and decays exponentially away from it. We demonstrate the application of this approach in salt water, using arrays of electromagnetic tiles that produce the required traveling wave excitation at a high efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2001163525,"Spectroscopy of Io's Pele plume against Jupiter by the Hubble Space Telescope in October 1999 revealed absorption due to S2 gas, with a column density of 1.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(16) per square centimeter, and probably also SO(2) gas with a column density of 7 +/- 3 x 10(16) per square centimeter. This SO2/S2 ratio (3 to 12) is expected from equilibration with silicate magmas near the quartz-fayalite-magnetite or wüstite-magnetite buffers. Condensed S3 and S4, probable coloring agents in Pele's red plume deposits, may form by polymerization of the S2, which is unstable to ultraviolet photolysis. Diffuse red deposits near other Io volcanoes suggest that venting and polymerization of S2 gas is a widespread feature of Io volcanism."

To date, TRP proteins have been extensively studied by heterologous expression giving rise to diverse channel properties and activation mechanisms including store-operated mechanisms. However, the molecular structure and the functional properties of native TRP channels still remain elusive. Here we analyze the properties of TRP4 (CCE1) channels in their native environment and characterize TRP expression patterns and store-operated calcium currents that are endogenous to bovine adrenal cells. We show by Northern blot analysis, immunoblots, and immunohistochemistry thatTRP4 transcripts and TRP4 protein are present in the adrenal cortex but absent in the medulla. Correspondingly, bovine adrenal cortex cells express TRP4 abundantly. The only otherTRP transcript found at considerable levels wasTRP1, whereas TRP2, TRP3, TRP5(CCE2), and TRP6 were not detectable. Depletion of calcium stores with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or thapsigargin activates store-operated ion channels in adrenal cells. These channels closely resemble calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels. Expression of trp4(CCE1) cDNA in antisense orientation significantly reduces both, the endogenous CRAC-like currents and the amount of native TRP4 protein. These results demonstrate that TRP4 contributes essentially to the formation of native CRAC-like channels in adrenal cells.

The receptor-dependent and phospholipase C-mediated formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)1 leads to the depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores which in turn activates store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane. The mechanisms linking store depletion to channel activation are still unknown but might include direct coupling of store proteins to the plasma membrane channel (1Berridge M.J. Biochem.

The best studied store-operated Ca2+ channels in terms of function and biophysical properties are calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels which have been originally described in mast cells and T-lymphocytes (16Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 17Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This prototype of a store-operated Ca2+ channel is characterized by its inward rectifying currents and by its high selectivity for Ca2+. The molecular structure of CRAC channels, however, remains elusive. Mammalian homologues of the Drosophila TRP and TRPL ion channels are candidate proteins underlying CRAC channels but also other store-operated and/or receptor-operated Ca2+ permeable ion channels. So far, the cDNAs of seven mammalian TRP genes have been cloned and characterized as functional cation channels after heterologous expression in various cell systems including HEK 293 cells, L-cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, SF9 insect cells, and Xenopus oocytes (reviewed in Ref. 18Philipp S. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Putney J.W.J. Calcium Signaling. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2000: 321-342Google Scholar). The gating mechanisms for the recombinant mammalian TRP channels are still controversial. The channels formed by heterologously expressed TRP1, TRP4, and TRP5 appear to be activated by maneuvers known to deplete Ca2+ stores and represent store-operated Ca2+ channels (19Zitt C. Zobel A.

Plant T.D. Obukhov A.G. Hofmann T. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 359: R69Google Scholar). In addition, TRP3 appears to be gated by Ca2+ store depletion via InsP3 (5Kiselyov K.I. Xu X. Mozhayeva G.N. Kuo T. Pessah I.N. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, direct activation by diacylglycerol of TRP3 and TRP6 cation channels has also been demonstrated (28Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). TRP1, TRP3, and TRP6 encode Ca2+ permeable but non-selective cation channels when expressed in eukaryotic cells (19Zitt C.

Obviously, some recombinant mammalian TRP channels are sensitive to store depletion and form ion channels mainly permeable to Ca2+ whereas others appear to be non-selective cation channels insensitive to store depletion. Probably, depletion-insensitive TRP proteins may form store-operated channels through multimerization with a store-sensitive subunit. TRP4 and TRP5 are appropriate candidates to play the role of a dominant subunit of these channels in terms of Ca2+ selectivity. To analyze the properties of TRP proteins, their cDNAs have been usually overexpressed in cells which already may contain various endogenous TRP proteins as well as store-operated Ca2+entry channels. HEK 293 cells, for example, show a significant amount of CRAC currents (34Fasolato C. Nilius B. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and do express TRP transcripts to some extent (25Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 26Groschner K. Hingel S. Lintschinger B. Balzer M. Romanin C. Zhu X. Schreibmeyer W.

Schilling W.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Expression of TRP cDNAs in HEK 293 cells might lead to heterooligomeric channels by multimerization of recombinant and endogenous TRP proteins. In addition, homomultimeric recombinant channels may be formed due to overexpression of the recombinant TRP cDNA in the heterologous system. Consequently, the activity of recombinant TRP channels expressed in a foreign cellular environment does not necessarily correspond to the activity of native store-operated Ca2+ channels. Further evidence linking TRP proteins to agonist induced Ca2+ entry was obtained by expression of mammalianTRP cDNA fragments in antisense orientation in mouse fibroblasts (37Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and salivary gland cells (38Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In clones of salivary gland cells stably expressing TRP1 antisense cDNA, Ca2+ influx in the presence of thapsigargin is decreased, suggesting that TRP1 is a candidate protein for store-operated calcium Ca2+ entry mechanisms (38Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B. Lockwich T. Jadlowiec J. Wellner R. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3403-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Using fura-2 Ca2+measurements, Birnbaumer and colleagues (37Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B. Brown D. Platano D. Sadeghi H. Stefani E. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15195-15202Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) reported that clonal lines of murine L(tk−) cells stably transfected with the muscarinic M5 receptor cDNA together with a mouse TRP4antisense cDNA fragments showed a lack of M5 receptor stimulated calcium entry. This entry could be due either to the activation of receptor-operated or store-operated channels, which might be selective for Ca2+. It remains to be shown which TRP proteins are expressed in L(tk−) cells. The TRP4 cDNA was originally isolated from bovine adrenal gland mRNA and we show now, that TRP4transcripts and proteins are abundantly expressed in the cortex but not in the medulla of the adrenal gland. To study TRP4 function in its native environment we used bovine adrenal cortex cells which were found to express significant amounts of TRP4. Analyzing store-operated currents, we show that these cells display endogenous CRAC-like currents after InsP3- or thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ store depletion. In this study we used an antisense strategy to dissect the relation between the TRP4 protein expression and native store-operated Ca2+ entry channels. Transfection of bovine adrenal cortex cells with TRP4 antisense cDNA reduces both, the endogenous CRAC-like current as well as the amount of endogenously expressed TRP4 protein strongly indicating that TRP4 is part of native CRAC-like channels in adrenal cells. The pCAGGS expression vector (39Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar) and the pCAGGS-EGFP plasmid containing the cDNA of the green fluorescent protein EGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) were kindly provided by Jun-ichi Miyazaki (Osaka University Medical School, Osaka, Japan). To create additional cloning sites the synthetic cDNA 5′-CTCGAGCGGCCGCTAGCCCGGGTACCATCGATATCTGATCAGAGCTCGAG-3′ was subcloned in the XhoI-cleaved pCAGGS in both orientations yielding pCAGGS1 and pCAGGS2. The NotI/AccI cDNA fragment of pEBFP (CLONTECH) encoding the blue fluorescent protein and the NotI/BspDI pCAGGS2 fragment were ligated to obtain the reporter plasmid pCAGGS2-EBFP. The complete coding cDNAs of bovine TRP4 (20Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) (previously CCE orCCE1) and bovine TRP2 (40Wissenbach U. Schroth G. Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were subcloned into pCAGGS2 in antisense orientation downstream of the β-actin promoter to obtain pCAGGS2-TRP4ANTI and pCAGGS2-TRP2ANTI. Bovine adrenocortical cells (SBAC, ATCC CRL 1796) were obtained seven passages after primary culture from the American Tissue and Cell Collection as frozen stocks. On thawing, cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Lot No. 40F4566J), 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were subcultured every third day and grown to ∼90% confluence. Cells were detached from plates in the presence of 0.5 g/liter trypsin (Life Technologies) and thereafter, trypsin was neutralized by addition of 10 volumes of serum-supplemented medium. Stocks were stored in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in liquid nitrogen until required for experiments. Transfection of SBAC cells (grown in 35-mm dishes to ∼80% confluence) was carried out essentially as described by the manufacturer of Superfect reagent (Quiagen) using 1 μg of pCAGGS-EGFP together with 3 μg of pCAGGS2-TRP4ANTI or 3 μg of pCAGGS2-EBFP or pCAGGS2-TRP2ANTI. Electroporation was carried out as follows: 107 cells were suspended in 300 μl of fresh medium and co-transfected with 5 μg of pCAGGS-EGFP and 15 μg of pCAGGS2-TRP4ANTI or 15 μg of pCAGGS2-EBFP, respectively, using a gene pulser transfection apparatus (Bio-Rad) at a setting of 0.23 kV and 960 microfarads. Transfection of HEK 293 cells with pCCE were carried out as described (20Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V.

A 365-bp bovine TRP5 cDNA fragment was amplified from 5 μg of DNase I-treated bovine brain total RNA using degenerated oligonucleotides corresponding to amino acids E467EWEMWH (5′-GARGARTGGGARATGTGGCA-3′) and M960HKWGDG (5′-CCRTCNCCCCAYTTRTGCAT-3′) and nested primers corresponding to amino acids L515DILKFL (5′-CTTGATATACTCAAATTTCTC-3′) and L630IADHAD (5′-TCAGCATGATCGGCAATG-3′) of mouse TRP5 (21Philipp S.

The alignment with the corresponding mouse and rabbit TRP5 sequences revealed 91 and 100% nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity, respectively. Bovine TRP6 cDNA fragments were amplified from DNase I-treated bovine brain total RNA using primers corresponding to D632IFKFMV (5′-GATATCTTCAAATTCATGGTC-3′) and S728SFQEIE (5′-CTCAATTTCCTGGAATGAAC-3′) of mouseTRP6 (30Boulay G.

The alignment with the corresponding mouse and human TRP6 sequences revealed 89.9 and 94.7% nucleotide and 100% amino acid sequence identity. The complete coding sequence of human TRP6 (2796 bp, Genbank accession number AJ006276) was amplified from human placenta poly(A)+ RNA. We found two alternatively spliced transcripts encoding hTRP6 variants now called hTRP6Δ316–431 and hTRP6Δ377–431 both lacking the first out of seven hydrophobic regions predicted to span the plasma membrane. The bTRP5, bTRP6,hTRP6, hTRP6Δ316–431, and hTRP6Δ377–431 sequences have been deposited to the GenBank data base under GenBank accession numbers AJ271070,AJ271069, AJ271066, AJ271067, and AJ271068, respectively. 5 μg of SBAC total RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min and reverse transcribed using random primers and SupercriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies). One-seventh of the resulting single strand cDNA or of negative control reactions performed without reverse transcriptase, were used for PCR in the presence of 0.2 μm primers specific for each bovine TRPsequence. The following primers were used: bTRP1 (GenBank accession number AF012900): 5′-GACAGATGTCAGGTTACC-3′ and 5′-ATTCTTTCAAGGGCTGGC-3′; bTRP2 (GenBank accession numberAJ006304): 5′-CACTTCTGCTGCAAAACC-3′ and 5′-AGCTCTGTCAGTCTGTTG-3′;bTRP3 (GenBank accession number AJ006781): 5′-CAATCTGGTACGAGAACC-3′ and 5′-CAGTCCAAGTGAACTGTG-3′; bTRP4(GenBank accession number X99792): 5′-TGGCGTCTCGCTGGTAC-3′ and 5′-AGGACCCACGGTAATATC-3′; bTRP5 (bCCE2, this manuscript): 5′-GTACTGCTGGCTTTTGCC-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCAGCACTACCAGG-3′;bTRP6 (this manuscript): 5′-TCATCATGGTGTTTGTGGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAACAATGACCATTGTAA-3′. As positive controls we used PCR reactions with 1 amol of recombinant plasmids containing the corresponding TRP cDNA as template. 1/10 of the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels. The identity of the amplified cDNA fragments was confirmed by restriction analysis in 5% polyacrylamide gels and by sequence analysis. Northern blots were performed using 10 μg of poly(A)+ RNA as described (20Philipp S. Cavalié A. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V.

The filters were exposed to x-ray films with intensifying screens at −80 °C for the times indicated. The filters used for analysis of TRP3 and TRP5 expression in SBAC cells were reused to analyze of TRP1 and TRP6 expression. For that purpose filters were stripped, exposed to x-ray films to control residual signals, hybridized with the second probe and, finally, with a 239-bp cDNA fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). 8-μm thick sections of freshly frozen adult bovine adrenal glands were hybridized to bovineTRP4 cRNA as described (21Philipp S.

Sense and antisense cRNA probes corresponding to the complete coding region of bovine TRP4were labeled by in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-33P]UTP using a linearized recombinant plasmid. A EcoRV cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 843 to 981 of bovine TRP4 was fused in-frame 3′ of the GST cDNA into pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to yield pGST-bTRP4c. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pGST-bTRP4c or pGEX4T-2 were grown in LB medium containing 2.5 mm betaine and 440 mm sorbitol. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then the cultures were incubated for 3 h at 29 °C. The following steps were carried out at 4 °C: cells were harvested, resuspended in TBS/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated 3 times for 30 s and incubated for 1 h in TBS/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The clear supernatant obtained after centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 ×g, was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h and washed 5–7 times with 10 volumes of TBS/phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer. GST and GST-bTRP4c fusion proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. The synthetic peptide D969TITHEDYVTTRL981 of bovine TRP4 was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanine activated with N-succinimidyl-3-maleinimidopropionate (Fluka) via an introduced amino-terminal cysteine residue and injected into rabbit 236 together with complete and incomplete Antibody-Multiplier-Adjuvans (Linaris). Serum was affinity purified using the synthetic peptide, which was coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from the local slaughterhouse and the cortex was homogenized in TBSP buffer (TBS, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm iodacetamide, 1 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 mm ortho-phenanthroline, 1 mm pepstatin A, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) using a Polytron tissue homogenizer (Kinematica AG). The homogenate was sedimented (15 min, 10,000 × g), re-extracted with TBSP buffer, and the combined supernatants were centrifuged for 40 min (42,000 ×g). The sedimented microsomes were resuspended in TBSP buffer and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). HEK 293 cells and SBAC cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4 m urea, 1% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, and 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Chromosomal DNA was sheared by pipetting through a 26-gauge needle. Reduced, denatured adrenal cortex microsomal proteins (see above), HEK 293 proteins, GST fusion proteins, and SBAC proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 μm) by tankblotting (Bio-Rad) in the presence of 20% methanol (250 mA, 1.5 h). Blots were stained with Ponceau red, incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS (4 °C, 1 h) before the primary antibody 236 (4 μg/ml) was added for 12 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed three times with TBS, and incubated for 1 h with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, clone RG-96). After three washes with TBS, staining reaction was performed in the presence of nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate for 30 min at 21 °C. SBAC and HEK cells grown in 24-well plates were fixed and stained using antibody 236 as described below. For quantification of TRP4 proteins in SBAC cells, trypsinated cells were seeded on microgrid coverslips (CELLocate, Eppendorf) at ∼5000 cells per well (24-well plate). As soon as cells became adherent the coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and cells were analyzed for GFP expression. Pictures of the same cells were taken, both, under fluorescent and under bright light using a CCD camera (T.I.L.L. Photonics) mounted on a Zeiss axiovert S100 microscope. Then, cells were fixed with a 7:3 (v/v) methanol:acetone solution for 20 min at −20 °C, permeabilized in the presence of 0.25% Triton X-100 in TBS and, for immunostaining, treated as described for immunoblots. Single GFP expressing SBAC cells were identified by their location on the microgrid coverslip. The amount of TRP4 present in single cells was measured densitometrically and analyzed using the AIDA software package (Raytest). Positive controls (nontransfected cells), negative controls (nontransfected cells but only using the secondary antibody), cells transfected with non-TRP specific sequences (pCAGGS2-EBFP and pCAGGS-EGFP) and cells transfected with pCAGGS-TRP4ANTI and pCAGGS-EGFP were always stained and analyzed in parallel. For analysis, background intensity obtained from the region close to the cell in question was subtracted. For immunohistochemistry, 12-μm cryostat sections of freshly removed bovine adrenal glands were mounted to gelatin-coated glass slides and air-dried. The sections were blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% fish gelatin and incubated overnight with the antibody 236 at room temperature. Visualization of the antigen-antibody complexes was done by incubating the tissue sections in the presence of the alkaline phosphata"
https://openalex.org/W2088345878,"The transcription factor TFIID contains the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and multiple TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here, the association of TFIID components with promoters that either are dependent on multiple TAFs (TAFdep) or have no apparent TAF requirement (TAFind) is analyzed in yeast. At TAFdep promoters, TAFs are present at levels comparable to that of TBP, whereas at TAFind promoters, TAFs are present at levels that approximate background. After inactivation of several general transcription factors, including TBP, TAFs are still recruited by activators to TAFdep promoters. The results reveal two classes of promoters: at TAFind promoters, TBP is recruited in the apparent absence of TAFs, whereas at TAFdep promoters, TAFs are co-recruited with TBP in a manner consistent with direct activator-TAF interactions."

In NIH 3T3 cells, caveolin-1 expression is dramatically up-regulated in confluent cells and localizes at areas of cell-cell contact. However, it remains unknown whether caveolin-1 is involved in cell-cell signaling. Here, we examine the potential role of caveolin-1 in regulating β-catenin signaling. β-Catenin plays a dual role in the cell, linking E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton and in Wnt signaling by forming a complex with members of the lymphoid enhancing factor (Lef-1) family of transcription factors. We show that E-cadherin, β-catenin, and γ-catenin (plakoglobin) are all concentrated in caveolae membranes. Moreover, we demonstrate that activation of β-catenin/Lef-1 signaling by Wnt-1 or by overexpression of β-catenin itself is inhibited by caveolin-1 expression. We also show that recombinant expression of caveolin-1 in caveolin-1 negative cells is sufficient to recruit β-catenin to caveolae membranes, thereby blocking β-catenin-mediated transactivation.

In support of this idea, caveolin-1 was found to suppress the kinase activity of Src family tyrosine kinases (c-Src/Fyn), epidermal growth factor receptor, Neu, and protein kinase C through the caveolin-scaffolding domain, a modular protein domain that recognizes a specific caveolin binding motif in various signaling molecules (3Couet J.

The constitutive activation of these signaling molecules can often cause cellular transformation. Because the interaction of caveolin-1 with signaling molecules leads to their inactivation (4Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that caveolin-1 may act as a tumor suppressor protein (24Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 25Engelman J.A. Wycoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that the level of caveolin-1 mRNA and protein expression and caveolae organelles are either lost or reduced during cell transformation by activated oncogene products such as v-Abl and Ha-Ras (G12V) (24Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Induction of caveolin-1 expression in v-Abl- and Ha-Ras (G12V)-transformed NIH 3T3 cells abrogated the anchorage-independent growth of these cells in soft agar and resulted in the de novo formation of caveolae (25Engelman J.A.

More recently, we have shown that an antisense-mediated reductions in caveolin-1 protein expression in NIH 3T3 cells is sufficient to drive oncogenic transformation and constitutively activate the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (26Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Finally, the human caveolin-1 gene is localized to a suspected tumor suppressor locus (D7S522; 7q31.1), a known fragile site (FRA7G) that is deleted in many types of cancer (27Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 28Engelman J.A. Zhang X.L. Lisanti M.P.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression and caveolae organelles may be critical for maintaining the transformed phenotype. In nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells, we have previously shown that caveolin-1 levels are down-regulated in rapidly dividing cells and dramatically elevated in confluent cells (26Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 31Volonte' D. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, at low cell density when no cell-cell contacts are made, caveolin-1 is localized in a punctate distribution over the entire cell surface and within the interior of the cell. When cells start to establish cell-cell contacts, caveolin-1 redistributes and localizes to areas of cell-cell contact. These observations may be related to the ability of caveolin-1 to regulate contact inhibition and growth arrest in nontransformed cells (26Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 31Volonte' D. Galbiati F. Lisanti M.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and raise the possibility that caveolin-1 is involved in regulating cell adhesion-mediated processes. Cell-cell adhesion plays an important role in tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis (32Gumbiner B.M.

Here, we have addressed the possible association of the E-cadherin-β-catenin complex with caveolae and caveolin-1. We show that β-catenin can be sequestered away from GSK-3β by associating with caveolae and caveolin-1. We also demonstrate that such interactions can affect Wnt signaling/β-catenin-mediated transactivation. Antibodies and their sources were as follows: anti-caveolin-1 IgG (mAb 2297 (64Scherer P.E.

All other biochemicals used were of the highest purity available and were obtained from regular commercial sources. NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and 10% donor bovine calf serum. MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Rac cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 10 μg/ml insulin. U251 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin), minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids, 8% glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (∼30–50% confluent) were transfected using a modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method and analyzed 48 h post-transfection. The full-length untagged cDNA encoding murine caveolin-1 (71Tang Z.-L. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 147: 299-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was inserted into an expression vector driven by the β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer (pCAGGS, gift of Dr. Armin Rehm, Ploegh Laboratory, Harvard Medical School, Cambridge, MA). U251 cells were co-transfected with the caveolin-1 vector (pCAGGS-Cav-1) and with a plasmid containing hygromycin resistance (pCB7) using a modified calcium phosphate precipitation protocol. U251 cells were also transfected with the empty vector pCAGGS as a critical control. Resistant clones were selected using hygromycin B (200 μg/ml). Individual clones were isolated using cloning rings. Lysates from stably transfected U251 cells were prepared and assayed for caveolin-1 expression by immunoblot analysis. Cells were scraped into 2 ml of MES-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Homogenization was carried out with 10 strokes of a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in MES-buffered saline and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band confined to the 15–20% sucrose region was observed that contained endogenous caveolin-1, but excluded most of other cellular proteins. From the top of each gradient, 1-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 12 fractions. Equal amounts of protein from each gradient fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 2% powdered skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (diluted ∼1000-fold in TBST) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG (diluted ∼5000-fold). Proteins were detected using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. The samples were then treated with 25 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to quench free aldehyde groups. The cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (diluted 1:1000 in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin). After three washes with PBS (10 min each), cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature: lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml)/fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml). Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (10 min each wash), and slides were mounted with slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) and observed under a Bio-Rad MR 600 confocal microscope. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 60 mm octyl-glucoside. Samples were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C using protein A-Sepharose (20 μl, slurry 1:1) and subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C using anti-caveolin-1 IgG (10 μl, pAb N-20) or anti-β-catenin IgG (10 μl, mAb) and protein A-Sepharose (30 μl, slurry 1:1). After three washes with the immunoprecipitation buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with anti-α-catenin, anti-β-catenin, anti-γ-catenin, anti-E-cadherin, or anti-GSK3β IgG (all mAb probes). Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 300,000 cells/well. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the Lef-1 reporter (pTOP-FLASH), 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase and 1 μg of the indicated cDNA. Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated in 1% serum for another 24–36 h. Cells were then lysed in 300 μl of extraction buffer; 80 μl was used to measure luciferase activity (72Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A.N. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 50 μl of which was used to measure β-galactosidase activity. The Lef-1 luciferase reporter activity was controlled for transfection efficiency and potential toxicity of treatments using β-galactosidase activity. The specificity of the effects on the Lef-1 reporter was confirmed using pFOP-FLASH, which contains mutated Lef-1 binding sites (44van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4652-4661PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate whether caveolin-1 is involved in mediating E-cadherin/β-catenin signaling, we examined the localization of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and γ-catenin (plakoglobin) in MDCK cells by laser-scanning confocal microscopy. Fig.1 demonstrates that caveolin-1 co-localizes with E-cadherin, β-catenin, and γ-catenin at the basolateral surface of MDCK cells and is predominantly excluded from the free apical plasma membrane. These results are consistent with our previous data showing that caveolin-1 is recruited from an intracellular location to areas of cell-cell contact as NIH 3T3 cells reach confluence (26Galbiati F. Volonte' D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To further investigate the co-localization of caveolin-1 with cadherin-catenin complexes, we took advantage of the known biophysical properties of caveolae domains. Caveolae membranes are resistant to extraction at 4 °C by nonionic detergents such as Triton X-100 and float on bottom-loaded sucrose density gradients because of their high content of cholesterol and sphingolipids. We used a well established procedure based on the detergent resistance and low buoyant density of caveolae to separate caveolae-enriched membrane fractions from the bulk of cellular membranes and cytosolic proteins (15Li S.

By using c-Cbl-induced ubiquitination of EGFR as a marker for transfer from early to late endosomes, we provide evidence that PKC can inhibit this process. In parallel, receptor down-regulation and degradation are significantly reduced. The inhibitory effects of PKC are mediated by a single threonine residue (threonine 654) of EGFR, which serves as a major PKC phosphorylation site. Biochemical and morphological analyses indicate that threonine-phosphorylated EGFR molecules undergo normal internalization, but instead of sorting to lysosomal degradation, they recycle back to the cell surface.

Ullrich A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 443-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). Homologous desensitization is initiated by ligand binding, and it entails endocytic removal of the activated receptors from the cell surface (“down-regulation”). Ligand·receptor complexes are rapidly recruited into clathrin-coated regions of the plasma membrane, which rapidly invaginate to form coated vesicles. Within minutes or less the coated vesicle delivers its content to the sorting early endosome, a peripheral vesicular compartment, whose internal pH is moderately acidic (2Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Sorting of incoming epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs)1 to the endosomal carrier vesicle (also called the multivesicular body) depends on the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR, and its default pathway appears to be delivery to the recycling endosome (reviewed in Ref. 3Di Fiore P.P. Gill G.N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying endosomal sorting has been recently attributed to trans-phosphorylation of the c-Cbl adaptor protein by EGFRs (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Upon its phosphorylation, the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase (5Joazeiro C.A.P. Wing S.S.

Whereas homologous desensitization is driven by the intrinsic kinase activity of EGFR, other protein kinases play a role in heterologous desensitization by a wide variety of stimuli. These include heterologous growth factors such as the platelet-derived growth factor (8Davis J.D. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), calcium (9Fearn J.C. King A.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 991-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Ref. 10Lund K.A. Lazar C.S. Chen W.S. Walsh B.J. Herbst J.B. Walton G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20517-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Both calcium and PMA stimulate protein kinase C (PKC), whose major phosphorylation site on the EGFR is threonine 654 (11Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Of the multiple effects of PKC on EGFR, both inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity and deceleration of receptor down-regulation have been attributed to threonine 654, but the disappearance of high affinity EGF binding sites appears independent of this residue (10Lund K.A. Lazar C.S. Chen W.S. Walsh B.J. Herbst J.B. Walton G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20517-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although trans-regulation by PKC significantly alters signaling downstream to EGFR, the exact mechanism remains unknown. For example, PKC activation causes translocation and stimulation of certain tyrosine phosphatases (12Zhao Z. Shen S.-H. Fisher E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5007-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which may explain why the surface EGFR is desensitized, but upon endocytosis its phosphorylation is significantly enhanced (13Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). According to an alternative model, PKC affects internalization of EGFR through a mechanism distinct from the one stimulated by EGF binding (14Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Carpenter C.D. Gill G.N. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1986; 44: 839-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Further, on the basis of the observation that PMA inhibits internalization and significantly reduces tyrosine kinase activity, it has been concluded that the juxtamembrane domain is involved in the transmission of conformational information from the extracellular ligand binding site to the cytoplasmic kinase domain (10Lund K.A. Lazar C.S. Chen W.S. Walsh B.J. Herbst J.B. Walton G.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20517-20523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One such mechanism may involve inhibition of receptor dimerization (15Kuppuswamy D. Pike J.L. Cell. Signalling. 1991; 3: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but a recent study proposed that phosphorylation at the juxtamembrane domain stabilizes ligand-induced receptor dimers (16Gulliford T. Ouyang X. Epstein R.J. Cell. Signalling. 1999; 11: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, despite a consensus that PKC affects several receptor functions, a unifying model is still unavailable. Because earlier works showed that activation of PKC leads to a disappearance of the unoccupied EGFR from the cell surface, but this is not accompanied by receptor degradation (14Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Carpenter C.D. Gill G.N. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1986; 44: 839-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 17Beguinot L. Hanover J.A. Ito S. Richert N.D. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we suspected that an endocytic mechanism may provide an explanation. To test this model we utilized receptor ubiquitination as a biochemical indication for EGFR sorting to the late endosome (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The results we present indicate that phosphorylation at threonine 654 diverts internalized EGFR molecules from a degradative fate to a recycling pathway. The emerging regulatory role of PKC in vesicular trafficking of a growth factor receptor may be relevant to other surface molecules whose endocytosis is ligand-mediated. Iodogen, EGF, monensin, and PMA were purchased from Sigma. GF109203X was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Radioactive materials were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The SG565 monoclonal antibody to EGFR was generated in our laboratory. The anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Antibodies to PKC isoforms, phosphotyrosine, and c-Cbl were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The active, doubly phosphorylated form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase) was detected by using a previously described antibody (18Yung Y.

Binding buffer contained RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES. Solubilization buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. HNTG buffer contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. EGF was labeled with 125I by using the Iodogen reagent. Cells were exposed to the indicated treatments in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After treatment, cells were extracted in solubilization buffer and mixed harshly, and lysates were cleared by centrifugation. The EGFR in the lysate supernatants was immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 1% milk and blotted for 2 h with a primary antibody (1 μg/ml) followed by a secondary antibody (0.5 μg/ml) linked to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive protein bands were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have previously described the construction of c-Cbl in the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) containing the HA sequence tag (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y.

To generate the T654A and K721A mutants of EGFR (threonine 654 mutated to an alanine or lysine 721 mutated to an alanine), we used the Quick-change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The ubiquitin-hemagglutinin A (HA-Ub) expression vector was a gift from Dirk Bohmann (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The protocols for transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were exactly as described (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA in each transfection was normalized with an empty pcDNA3 plasmid. Cells pretreated with solvent (ethanol) or with PMA (100 nm) at 37 °C were washed with binding buffer and then incubated for up to 8 min in the presence of a radiolabeled EGF (5 ng/ml). The cells were then put on ice and washed twice with binding buffer, and cellular distribution of the radiolabeled ligand was determined by using a 7-min-long incubation in 0.5 ml of solution of 0.2 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl. The released radioactivity was considered as cell surface-associated ligand. The remaining radioactivity was solubilized in 100 mm NaOH solution containing 0.1% SDS and considered as internalized ligand. CHO cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding a wild type or a mutant EGFR. Forty-eight hours post-transfection cells were treated without or with PMA for 20 min at 37 °C. EGF was then added, and incubation was continued for various time intervals. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed once with binding buffer and twice with an acidic buffer (2.5 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, and 50 mm acetic acid) at room temperature to remove surface-bound ligand (19Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Starbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then washed twice in cold binding buffer and incubated with 0.5 nm125I-EGF for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice and solubilized in 100 mm NaOH solution containing 0.1% SDS, and radioactivity was determined in a γ-counter. CHO cells grown in 48-well plates were transfected with expression vectors encoding a WT or T654A mutant receptor. Forty-eight hours later cells were pretreated at 37 °C with PMA, and 15 min later they were incubated at 4 °C with increasing concentrations of a radiolabeled EGF. Specific binding of the ligand was determined in duplicates after 2 h and analyzed by using the Scatchard method (20Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17746) Google Scholar). To follow receptor recycling we used transfected CHO cells and a previously described protocol (21Kornilova E. Sorkina T. Beguinot L. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30340-30346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed with ice-cold binding buffer and incubated with 1 ng/ml 125I-EGF at 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were then rinsed twice with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and allowed to internalize the ligand for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, cells were rinsed with cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and125I-EGF remaining on the cell surface was removed by using a 2.5-min-long wash with a mildly acidic solution (0.2 msodium acetate, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 4.5).125I-EGF-loaded cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a nonradioactive EGF (100 ng/ml) to saturate surface receptors and then switched to 37 °C for different time intervals to allow for receptor trafficking. At the end of each incubation period, cells were placed on ice, and media were collected to determine the amount of degraded and intact 125I-EGF. This was followed by a 2.5-min-long acid wash (pH 2.8) to determine the amount of surface-bound 125I-EGF. Cells were then solubilized with 1 N NaOH to determine the amount of intracellular 125I-EGF. To separate intact from degraded 125I-EGF products, trichloroacetic acid and phosphotungstic acid were added to the collected medium to final concentrations of 3 and 0.3%, respectively. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to collect precipitates. These were solubilized with 1 N NaOH before counting in a γ-counter, and the supernatants were used to calculate the amount of degraded 125I-EGF. For the effect of PMA treatment, the cells were similarly treated except that preincubation for 20 min was performed with PMA. The amount of recycled125I-EGF was calculated as a fraction of the total cell-associated radioactivity (22Kil S.J. Hobert M. Carlin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3141-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were plated on coverslips in 6-well plates and assayed 24 h later. Cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then pretreated for 20 min at 37 °C without or with PMA before exposure to EGF for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For immunofluorescent labeling, cells were permeabilized for 10 min at 22 °C with PBS containing 1% albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a monoclonal antibody to EGFR (10 μg/ml). After washing with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for an additional hour. Finally, the coverslips were mounted in Elvanol (Hoechst, Frankfurt) and viewed with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon). For co-localization experiments addressing the late endosomal compartment, cells were pretreated with PMA and then incubated for 20 min with EGF. Following fixation, cells were stained with a rabbit antibody to EGFR or with a murine antibody to lysobisphosphatidic acid (antibody 6C4) (23Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Antibody detection was performed with a fluoresceine-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 or Cy3-conjugated goat-anti-mouse F(ab′)2 antibodies (from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), respectively. To follow the recycling pathway we used a rhodamine-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Lastly, to directly follow EGF, cells were prepared on coverslips as for immunofluorescence analysis. After preincubation with PMA, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with Texas-red EGF (0.5 μg/ml; from Molecular Probes) and then transferred to 37 °C for 15 min. Fixation was performed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Microscopic images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal system, using an argon/krypton mixed gas laser, and mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. CHO cells were selected as a cellular system because these cells express no endogenous EGFR. The receptor was transiently expressed in living cells by using transfection, and cells were treated with EGF subsequent to their exposure to either PMA or to the solvent. Approximately a 50% reduction in the level of the cell surface localized receptor was induced after a 60-min-long exposure to EGF, but pretreatment with PMA decelerated the rate of ligand-induced down-regulation of EGFR (Fig.1 A). PMA alone partially down-regulated EGFR, in agreement with previous reports (17Beguinot L. Hanover J.A. Ito S. Richert N.D. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2774-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 14Lin C.R. Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Carpenter C.D. Gill G.N. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1986; 44: 839-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Because down-regulation is the net result of receptor degradation and recycling back to the cell surface, we tested the ability of PMA to affect the ubiquitin-mediated tagging of EGFR to lysosomal degradation (4Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir L. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Co-expression of a peptide-tagged ubiquitin together with EGFR allowed sensitive detection of ubiquitin adducts, and further enhancement of this process was achieved by simultaneous overexpression of c-Cbl. As expected, EGF-induced ubiquitination of EGFR was significantly enhanced by an overexpressed c-Cbl. However, pretreatment of living cells with PMA remarkably reduced the level of receptor ubiquitination, even in the presence of an overexpressed c-Cbl (Fig.1 B). Ubiquitination levels correlated with the degradation of EGFR; maximal degradation was observed upon EGF treatment of c-Cbl-overexpressing cells. These characteristics were better reflected in an experiment that tested increasing concentrations of PMA, up to 1 μm; at high concentrations PMA alone exerted only a small inhibitory effect on EGFR degradation, but when tested together with EGF we observed remarkable inhibition of both receptor degradation and ubiquitination (Fig. 2 A). Concomitant with these extensive inhibitory effects, PMA also moderately reduced receptor phosphorylation on tyrosine residues (Fig.2 B). Control experiments that tested mitogen-activated protein kinase activation indicated that both EGF and PMA stimulated this kinase cascade (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). Taken together, the results presented in Figs. 1 and 2 indicate that the inhibitory effects of PMA on ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR are functionally linked, suggesting a common mechanism that limits homologous desensitization of EGFR.Figure 2PMA inhibits degradation of EGFR.A, CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EGFR, c-Cbl, and HA-Ub. Forty-eight hours later, cells were left untreated (−) or treated with increasing concentrations of PMA (0.1, 1.0, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 nm), as indicated. Thereafter, cells were untreated or treated for 10 min at 37 °C with EGF (100 ng/ml). Subsequently, cell lysates were prepared, and EGFR was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-EGFR antibodies. B, whole cell lysates were directly analyzed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (P-Tyr) or with a monoclonal antibody specific to the active, doubly phosphorylated form of mitogen-activated protein kinase.IP, immunoprecipitate; IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although tumor-promoting phorbol esters act as specific binders and activators of PKC, they may also modulate other signaling pathways. Two lines of evidence implicate PKC in the reduction of receptor ubiquitination and degradation following treatment with PMA. First, inhibition of PKC by using the highly specific antagonist GF109203X abolished the inhibitory effect of PMA on receptor ubiquitination (Fig.3 A). The antagonistic effect of GF109203X on receptor degradation was apparent especially when ubiquitination and degradation were enhanced by an overexpressed c-Cbl (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that PKC action is located upstream to c-Cbl. Because EGF by itself can stimulate PKC in intact cells (24Whitley B. Glaser L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we asked whether PKC can limit receptor down-regulation following ligand binding to EGFR. Indeed, blocking PKC with the specific antagonist moderately enhanced ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR, especially in the presence of an overexpressed c-Cbl (Fig.3 C). This observation implies that physiological activation of PKC by EGF, probably through the activation of phospholipase Cγ, can reduce the extent of homologous desensitization. The second line of evidence implicating PKC is presented in Fig.4; chronic down-regulation of the kinase by using prolonged exposure of cells to PMA enhanced EGF-induced ubiquitination of EGFR, in line with a restrictive role of PKC in EGFR ubiquitination. In addition, the effect of a short treatment with PMA was partially impaired in PKC-depleted cells. Control Western blotting experiments confirmed enhanced degradation of both the α and ε isoforms of PKC upon long exposure to PMA (Fig. 4, lower panels). Conceivably, activation of PKC, either directly (by PMA) or indirectly (by EGF), can reduce the extent of receptor ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The results shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 implicate PKC in an escape route from receptor degradation, but they leave open the underlying mechanism and the role played by threonine 654. To address the role of this major PKC phosphorylation site, we replaced the threonine with an alanine (mutant denoted T654A). Initial analyses confirmed that the mutant behaved as predicted by previous studies, namely its ligand-induced phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was not affected by PMA, unlike the wild type receptor, whose phosphorylation was reduced upon treatment with PMA (Figs.2 B and 5 B). Likewise, high affinity ligand binding to the wild type receptor was reduced when cells were pretreated with PMA, but this agonist of PKC only minimally affected EGF binding to the T654A mutant (Fig.6 A). Confirmation of the functional characteristics of T654A allowed us to address its ubiquitination and degradation. Evidently, replacement of threonine 654 by an alanine completely abolished the inhibitory effects of PMA on both receptor ubiquitination and receptor degradation (Fig.5 A). First, receptor ubiquitination and degradation were no longer inhibited when cells expressing T654A were exposed to a combination of EGF and PMA, and second, PMA could not abolish degradation of the T654A mutant, as it did in the case of the wild type receptor. Thus, the juxtamembrane domain of EGFR appears to play a major role in the PKC-mediated escape of EGFR from ubiquitination and degradation.Figure 6Threonine 654 of EGFR mediates the effect of PKC on receptor down-regulation and recycling of the EGF· EGFR complex. A, CHO cells were transiently transfected with a WT EGFR expression vector or with a plasmid encoding the T654A mutant (right panel). Forty-eight hours post-transfection duplicate cultures were treated for 20 min at 37 °C without (open symbols) or with PMA (100 nm, closed symbols) prior to performing a binding assay with increasing concentrations of a radiolabeled EGF. The results were analyzed by using the Scatchard method. B, cells were treated as inA, except that after exposure to PMA, or solvent alone, EGF (100 ng/ml) was added, and incubation was continued for the indicated time intervals at 37 °C. Bound EGF was removed, and the level of surface receptors was determined by incubating the cells for 1 h at 4 °C with a radiolabeled EGF. For control we tested a kinase-defective mutant of EGFR (K721A, triangles).C, CHO cells expressing WT EGFR (left panel) or the T654A mutant (right panel) were pretreated for 20 min at 37 °C without (open symbols) or with PMA (100 nm, closed symbols). Thereafter, cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a radiolabeled EGF (5 ng/ml) followed by incubation at 37 °C for various time intervals. At the end of incubation, cells were rinsed twice with binding buffer and then treated with a low pH buffer that removes surface-bound ligand. The acid-inaccessible internalized ligand is presented as a fraction of total cell-associated radioactivity prior to cell transfer to 37 °C. For control we tested the behavior of a kinase-defective mutant of EGFR (K721A, triangles). D, CHO cells were preincubated at 4 °C for 1 h with a radiolabeled EGF (5 ng/ml) and then switched to 37 °C for 10 min to allow ligand internalization. Sister cultures were pretreated with PMA prior to exposure to EGF (closed symbols). After removing surface-bound ligand, 125I-EGF-loaded cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a 100-fold excess of an unlabeled EGF. Thereafter, cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods of time. At the end of incubation, media were collected, and the fraction of degraded 125I-EGF was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Surface-bound and internalized ligand fractions were then assayed. The sum of intact radiolabeled EGF (medium and surface-bound) was expressed as the percentage of total radioactivity at each time point. The average and range (bars) of duplicate determinations is shown. For control we tested a kinase-defective mutant of EGFR (K721A,triangles). Each of the experiments shown was repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl is essential for ligand-induced ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR (6Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), our next series of experiments tested the ability of the T654A mutant to engage c-Cbl. As expected, ligand binding stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both c-Cbl and EGFR. However, PMA treatment of cells expressing the wild type receptor, but not the T654A mutant, led to a significant reduction in ligand-induced phosphorylation of both the receptor and the substrate (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl was coupled to its enhanced degradation. Both events were induced by EGF and inhibited by PMA (Fig. 5 B). It is noteworthy that according to a recent report, the macrophage growth factor can elevate ubiquitination of c-Cbl, which is followed by de-ubiquitination and no degradation (25Lee P.S. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but EGF-induced proteolysis of c-Cbl has not been reported before. Nevertheless, mutagenesis of threonine 654 of EGFR did not protect c-Cbl from EGF-induced degradation. Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 5 imply that PKC-mediated modification of EGFR at threonine 654 impairs the ability of the modified receptor to engage c-Cbl, and therefore subsequent receptor ubiquitination and degradation are reduced. Two lines of reasoning led us to suspect that modification at threonine 654 alters intracellular routin"

We show that FGF-induced angiogenesis can be modulated using selectively desulfated heparin. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO677) deficient in heparan sulfate biosynthesis were employed to assess the function of heparin/heparan sulfate in FGF receptor-1 (FGFR-1) signal transduction and biological responses. In the presence of FGF-2, FGFR-1 kinase and subsequent mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk2 activities were augmented in a dose-dependent manner, whereas high concentrations of heparin resulted in decreased activity. The length of the heparin oligomer, minimally an 8/10-mer, was critical for the ability to enhance FGFR-1 kinase activity. The N- and 2-O-sulfate groups of heparin were essential for binding to FGF-2, whereas stimulation of FGFR-1 and Erk2 kinases by FGF-2 also required the presence of 6-O-sulfate groups. Sulfation at 2-O- and 6-O-positions was moreover a prerequisite for binding of heparin to a lysine-rich peptide corresponding to amino acids 160–177 in the extracellular domain of FGFR-1. Selectively 6-O-desulfated heparin, which binds to FGF-2 but fails to bind the receptor, decreased FGF-2-induced proliferation of CHO677 cells, presumably by displacing intact heparin. Furthermore, FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in chick embryos was inhibited by 6-O-desulfated heparin. Thus, formation of a ternary complex of FGF-2, heparin, and FGFR-1 appears critical for the activation of FGFR-1 kinase and downstream signal transduction. Preventing complex formation by modified heparin preparations may allow regulation of FGF-2 functions, such as induction of angiogenesis.

FGFs exert their effects by binding with high affinity to four distinct but highly related receptor tyrosine kinases (FGF receptor-1, -2, -3, and -4) (1Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of FGF to FGF receptors leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular receptor domain (2Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). FGF receptor autophosphorylation allows binding of signal transduction molecules, resulting in activation of signal transduction pathways and eventually in cellular responses such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The Ras pathway is known to be important in several biological responses to FGF. Key components in this pathway are the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2, which are activated and translocated to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and thereby regulate the activities of certain early gene transcription factors, such as Myc and Fos (1Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF has also been shown to be translocated to the nucleus and induce DNA synthesis independently of FGF receptors (3Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).It is well established that FGFs bind to heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin, and there are many examples of the biological significance of such interactions. Binding of FGF to HS on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix protects FGF from degradation (4Klagsbrun M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). The HS-immobilized FGF can be released by heparanases and may acte.g. in injury repair processes (5Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). HS is furthermore directly implicated in the biological action of FGF. Cells deficient in endogenous HS are not responsive to FGF, but the responsiveness can be restored by the addition of exogenous heparin (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). HS and heparin are structurally related, sulfated glycosaminoglycans composed of alternating hexuronic acid and glucosamine units. The biological functions of these polysaccharides reflect their binding to proteins, through interactions which are largely ionic and involve the negatively charged carboxyl and sulfate groups along with the basic amino acid residues. Sulfation may occur at the N-, 3-O-, and 6-O-positions of glucosamine residues and at the 2-O-position of hexuronic acid units (7Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol.

The results of attempts to define in molecular terms the role of heparin/HS in FGF function are intriguing. A minimal saccharide sequence required for FGF-2 binding consists of five monosaccharide units, with N-sulfate groups, and a single iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate residue but no 6-O-sulfate (12Ishihara M.

However, analysis of the role of saccharide sulfation suggests that not only 2-O- but also one or more 6-O-sulfate groups are needed for FGF-2-induced mitogenic signaling (15Guimond S. Maccarana M.

In fact, heparin/HS has been shown to interact not only with FGFs but also with their receptors (19Kinsella L. Chen H.L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have aimed to define the effects of chain length and specific O-sulfate groups on heparin/HS-dependent, FGF-2-induced cellular responses at different stages along the signaling chain. In particular, selectively 2-O- and 6-O-desulfated heparin derivatives were applied as inhibitors of such reactions, including phosphorylation of FGFR-1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk2. Moreover, the approach was extended to include FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. All of these processes were similarly affected by the desulfated heparins; the 6-O-desulfated preparation was inhibitory, whereas the 2-O-sulfated preparation was not.DISCUSSIONThe requirement for heparin/HS in FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis or cell differentiation has been established using different HS-deficient cell models. It has been shown that FGF-2 fails to repress differentiation of chlorate-treated MM14 myoblasts (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). There is furthermore no increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in FGF-2-treated BAF32 cells (16Pye D.A. Vives R.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which are devoid of endogenous HS, nor in chlorate-treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts (6Rapraeger A.C.

We have employed the HS-deficient CHO677 cell line to analyze in greater detail the sulfate dependence of FGF-2-induced cellular responses.Two strategies have been pursued. First, selectivelyO-desulfated heparins have been tested for their ability to promote effects of FGF-2 in the HS-deficient cells. Second, the same modified heparins have been assessed for their ability to inhibit FGF-2 effects that are promoted by fully sulfated heparin and by endogenous HS. By these approaches we could demonstrate that FGF-2-induced FGFR-1 activation, Erk2 kinase induction, and angiogenesis all depend on a saccharide containing both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups. Because binding of FGF-2 to heparin/HS requires 2-O-sulfate only (13Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Faham S.

It has been proposed that the role of the saccharide is to present FGF to its tyrosine kinase receptors in a dimeric fashion, thereby facilitating dimerization of receptors (2Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding of FGF-2 to heparin fits with this model. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is critically dependent on the formation of receptor dimers (35Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar), which could be facilitated by dimerization of the monomeric FGF. Indeed, dimerization of platelet-derived growth factor is dependent on the dimeric configuration of the ligand. However, this model does not readily explain the requirement for 6-O-sulfate groups in promoting FGF-induced effects. Conceivably, this residue could be involved in the binding of a second FGF-2 molecule, on the opposite side of the saccharide backbone relative to an FGF-2 binding site involving a 2-O-sulfate group only (17DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of observations suggest involvement of the receptor in heparin/HS binding, where the saccharide bridges the growth factor and the receptor molecules (19Kinsella L.

Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) identified a heparin binding peptide (denoted K18K) in the extracellular domain of FGFR-1 and showed that this peptide is able to block FGF-induced cellular responses. Our present results demonstrate that binding of heparin to this peptide is dependent on 6-O- as well as 2-O-sulfation of the saccharide. A requirement for 2-O-sulfation for FGF-2 binding and 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation for receptor binding would be in excellent agreement with the finding that the minimal HS oligosaccharide able to rescue FGF-2-induced biological responses in HS-deficient cells is a 10/12-mer containing both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups (15Guimond S.

A further argument in favor of the bridging hypothesis rather than the FGF dimerization model, is the finding by Pye and Gallagher (37Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that a conjugate of an FGF-2 monomer covalently bound to a heparin oligosaccharide showed mitogenic activity. Taken together, the available evidence would tend to favor the involvement of a ternary complex involving a HS sequence that binds to both FGF and to the receptor. The detailed composition of such as complex remains to be determined. Recent crystallographic data identify complexes composed of two sets of FGF ligand-receptor extracellular domain units. The units are pictured by molecular modeling to be held together by a polysaccharide string that traverses from one FGF molecule through a grove between the two receptor molecules, containing the heparin binding receptor sequence identified by Kan et al. (20Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), to finally reach the second FGF molecule (38Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).Our data furthermore suggest that heparin does not contribute solely by increasing the number of active, signaling receptors but possibly also by increasing the number of phosphorylation sites available for the kinase, resulting in a more efficient phosphorylation of individual receptors. This argument is based on data showing that heparin increases the affinity of FGF-2 in binding to FGFR-1, thereby decreasing the dissociation constant from 40 to 15 pm(39Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One μg of FGF-2 (47.8 nm)/ml, as added in Fig.1 A, corresponds to a concentration 1000-fold above theK d value and should saturate the cell surface expressed FGF receptors with or without heparin. However, there is still a strong increase in FGFR-1 autophosphorylation when heparin is added in combination with FGF-2 at 1 μg/ml. Our preliminary data using two-dimensional separation of FGFR-1 tryptic phosphopeptides indicate that heparin increases the utilization of certain phosphorylation sites more than others, compatible with a change in FGFR-1 conformation in the presence of heparin. 3L. Lundin and L. Claesson-Welsh, manuscript in preparation. FGF-2 alone to some extent stimulated FGFR-1 and Erk2 kinase activities in CHO677 cells (Fig. 1 A). A similar level of Erk2 activation by FGF-2 alone was recorded in CHO745 cells (22Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which lack expression of both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (data now shown). These data indicate that heparin modulates, but is not strictly required for, all FGF-2 effects.There is a clear specificity in heparin sulfation required for biological activity of FGF (15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The fact that sulfation is organ specific (9Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) suggests that the effect of FGF in vivo does not only depend on expression of FGF and FGF receptors, but also on the activating HS structures (see Fig. 4 D). We show that 6-O-desulfated heparin may block FGF-2-induced biological effects by competing with endogenous heparan sulfate and efficiently inhibits angiogenesis in the chicken CAM. Deregulated angiogenesis is recognized as a complicating factor in a wide spectrum of diseases, notably in tumor progression. The potential of anti-angiogenic treatment, e.g. for vascularized solid tumors, is currently intensely explored. Treatment using desulfated heparin would inhibit the FGF-induced effects in the disease, and it may also affect other factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a heparin binding growth factor acting on endothelial cells (40Ferrara N. Claesson-Welsh L. Vascular Growth Factors and Angiogenesis in Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. 237. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 1-30Google Scholar). Our future efforts will be aimed at further exploring the potential of heparin derivatives in treatment of FGF- and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 constitute a family of about 20 structurally related polypeptides, which regulate cell growth, motility, and differentiation. FGFs exert their effects by binding with high affinity to four distinct but highly related receptor tyrosine kinases (FGF receptor-1, -2, -3, and -4) (1Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of FGF to FGF receptors leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation of the intracellular receptor domain (2Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). FGF receptor autophosphorylation allows binding of signal transduction molecules, resulting in activation of signal transduction pathways and eventually in cellular responses such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The Ras pathway is known to be important in several biological responses to FGF. Key components in this pathway are the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1 and Erk2, which are activated and translocated to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and thereby regulate the activities of certain early gene transcription factors, such as Myc and Fos (1Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 165-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF has also been shown to be translocated to the nucleus and induce DNA synthesis independently of FGF receptors (3Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is well established that FGFs bind to heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin, and there are many examples of the biological significance of such interactions. Binding of FGF to HS on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix protects FGF from degradation (4Klagsbrun M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 81-87PubMed Google Scholar). The HS-immobilized FGF can be released by heparanases and may acte.g. in injury repair processes (5Kato M. Wang H. Kainulainen V. Fitzgerald M.L. Ledbetter S. Ornitz D.M. Bernfield M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). HS is furthermore directly implicated in the biological action of FGF. Cells deficient in endogenous HS are not responsive to FGF, but the responsiveness can be restored by the addition of exogenous heparin (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). HS and heparin are structurally related, sulfated glycosaminoglycans composed of alternating hexuronic acid and glucosamine units. The biological functions of these polysaccharides reflect their binding to proteins, through interactions which are largely ionic and involve the negatively charged carboxyl and sulfate groups along with the basic amino acid residues. Sulfation may occur at the N-, 3-O-, and 6-O-positions of glucosamine residues and at the 2-O-position of hexuronic acid units (7Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 8Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The sulfation pattern of HS is tissue-specific (9Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), varying however with the state of embryonic development (10Brickman Y.G.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13395-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The results of attempts to define in molecular terms the role of heparin/HS in FGF function are intriguing. A minimal saccharide sequence required for FGF-2 binding consists of five monosaccharide units, with N-sulfate groups, and a single iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate residue but no 6-O-sulfate (12Ishihara M.

Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). By contrast, a sequence of about twice this size is needed to promote FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis (15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

Aviezer D. Yayon A. Powers R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4782-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the role of saccharide sulfation suggests that not only 2-O- but also one or more 6-O-sulfate groups are needed for FGF-2-induced mitogenic signaling (15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), potentially implicating binding partners distinct from FGF-2. In fact, heparin/HS has been shown to interact not only with FGFs but also with their receptors (19Kinsella L. Chen H.L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L.

In the present study, we have aimed to define the effects of chain length and specific O-sulfate groups on heparin/HS-dependent, FGF-2-induced cellular responses at different stages along the signaling chain. In particular, selectively 2-O- and 6-O-desulfated heparin derivatives were applied as inhibitors of such reactions, including phosphorylation of FGFR-1 and the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk2. Moreover, the approach was extended to include FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. All of these processes were similarly affected by the desulfated heparins; the 6-O-desulfated preparation was inhibitory, whereas the 2-O-sulfated preparation was not. DISCUSSIONThe requirement for heparin/HS in FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis or cell differentiation has been established using different HS-deficient cell models. It has been shown that FGF-2 fails to repress differentiation of chlorate-treated MM14 myoblasts (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). There is furthermore no increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in FGF-2-treated BAF32 cells (16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which are devoid of endogenous HS, nor in chlorate-treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have employed the HS-deficient CHO677 cell line to analyze in greater detail the sulfate dependence of FGF-2-induced cellular responses.Two strategies have been pursued. First, selectivelyO-desulfated heparins have been tested for their ability to promote effects of FGF-2 in the HS-deficient cells. Second, the same modified heparins have been assessed for their ability to inhibit FGF-2 effects that are promoted by fully sulfated heparin and by endogenous HS. By these approaches we could demonstrate that FGF-2-induced FGFR-1 activation, Erk2 kinase induction, and angiogenesis all depend on a saccharide containing both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups.

Treatment using desulfated heparin would inhibit the FGF-induced effects in the disease, and it may also affect other factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a heparin binding growth factor acting on endothelial cells (40Ferrara N. Claesson-Welsh L. Vascular Growth Factors and Angiogenesis in Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology. 237. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 1-30Google Scholar). Our future efforts will be aimed at further exploring the potential of heparin derivatives in treatment of FGF- and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis. The requirement for heparin/HS in FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis or cell differentiation has been established using different HS-deficient cell models. It has been shown that FGF-2 fails to repress differentiation of chlorate-treated MM14 myoblasts (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). There is furthermore no increased [3H]thymidine incorporation in FGF-2-treated BAF32 cells (16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which are devoid of endogenous HS, nor in chlorate-treated NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts (6Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have employed the HS-deficient CHO677 cell line to analyze in greater detail the sulfate dependence of FGF-2-induced cellular responses. Two strategies have been pursued. First, selectivelyO-desulfated heparins have been tested for their ability to promote effects of FGF-2 in the HS-deficient cells. Second, the same modified heparins have been assessed for their ability to inhibit FGF-2 effects that are promoted by fully sulfated heparin and by endogenous HS. By these approaches we could demonstrate that FGF-2-induced FGFR-1 activation, Erk2 kinase induction, and angiogenesis all depend on a saccharide containing both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups. Because binding of FGF-2 to heparin/HS requires 2-O-sulfate only (13Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 31Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10337-10341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to conclude that the 6-O-sulfation is required for another interaction. This suggestion may be evaluated in relation to various current models of heparin/HS-supported FGF-2 action. It has been proposed that the role of the saccharide is to present FGF to its tyrosine kinase receptors in a dimeric fashion, thereby facilitating dimerization of receptors (2Spivak-Kroizman T. Lemmon M.A. Dikic I. Ladbury J.E. Pinchasi D. Huang J. Jaye M. Crumley G. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Cell. 1994; 79: 1015-1024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The high affinity binding of FGF-2 to heparin fits with this model. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is critically dependent on the formation of receptor dimers (35Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar), which could be facilitated by dimerization of the monomeric FGF. Indeed, dimerization of platelet-derived growth factor is dependent on the dimeric configuration of the ligand. However, this model does not readily explain the requirement for 6-O-sulfate groups in promoting FGF-induced effects. Conceivably, this residue could be involved in the binding of a second FGF-2 molecule, on the opposite side of the saccharide backbone relative to an FGF-2 binding site involving a 2-O-sulfate group only (17DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of observations suggest involvement of the receptor in heparin/HS binding, where the saccharide bridges the growth factor and the receptor molecules (19Kinsella L. Chen H.L. Smith J.A. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L.

Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) identified a heparin binding peptide (denoted K18K) in the extracellular domain of FGFR-1 and showed that this peptide is able to block FGF-induced cellular responses. Our present results demonstrate that binding of heparin to this peptide is dependent on 6-O- as well as 2-O-sulfation of the saccharide. A requirement for 2-O-sulfation for FGF-2 binding and 2-O- and 6-O-sulfation for receptor binding would be in excellent agreement with the finding that the minimal HS oligosaccharide able to rescue FGF-2-induced biological responses in HS-deficient cells is a 10/12-mer containing both 2-O- and 6-O-sulfate groups (15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A further argument in favor of the bridging hypothesis rather than the FGF dimerization model, is the finding by Pye and Gallagher (37Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13456-13461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that a conjugate of an FGF-2 monomer covalently bound to a heparin oligosaccharide showed mitogenic activity. Taken together, the available evidence would tend to favor the involvement of a ternary complex involving a HS sequence that binds to both FGF and to the receptor. The detailed composition of such as complex remains to be determined. Recent crystallographic data identify complexes composed of two sets of FGF ligand-receptor extracellular domain units. The units are pictured by molecular modeling to be held together by a polysaccharide string that traverses from one FGF molecule through a grove between the two receptor molecules, containing the heparin binding receptor sequence identified by Kan et al. (20Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), to finally reach the second FGF molecule (38Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Our data furthermore suggest that heparin does not contribute solely by increasing the number of active, signaling receptors but possibly also by increasing the number of phosphorylation sites available for the kinase, resulting in a more efficient phosphorylation of individual receptors. This argument is based on data showing that heparin increases the affinity of FGF-2 in binding to FGFR-1, thereby decreasing the dissociation constant from 40 to 15 pm(39Roghani M. Mansukhani A. Dell'Era P. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3976-3984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One μg of FGF-2 (47.8 nm)/ml, as added in Fig.1 A, corresponds to a concentration 1000-fold above theK d value and should saturate the cell surface expressed FGF receptors with or without heparin. However, there is still a strong increase in FGFR-1 autophosphorylation when heparin is added in combination with FGF-2 at 1 μg/ml. Our preliminary data using two-dimensional separation of FGFR-1 tryptic phosphopeptides indicate that heparin increases the utilization of certain phosphorylation sites more than others, compatible with a change in FGFR-1 conformation in the presence of heparin. 3L. Lundin and L. Claesson-Welsh, manuscript in preparation. FGF-2 alone to some extent stimulated FGFR-1 and Erk2 kinase activities in CHO677 cells (Fig. 1 A). A similar level of Erk2 activation by FGF-2 alone was recorded in CHO745 cells (22Esko J.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), which lack expression of both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (data now shown). These data indicate that heparin modulates, but is not strictly required for, all FGF-2 effects. There is a clear specificity in heparin sulfation required for biological activity of FGF (15Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The fact that sulfation is organ specific (9Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17804-17810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) suggests that the effect of FGF in vivo does not only depend on expression of FGF and FGF receptors, but also on the activating HS structures (see Fig. 4 D). We show that 6-O-desulfated heparin may block FGF-2-induced biological effects by competing with endogenous heparan sulfate and efficiently inhibits angiogenesis in the chicken CAM. Deregulated angiogenesis is recognized as a complicating factor in a wide spectrum of diseases, notably in tumor progression. The potential of anti-angiogenic treatment, e.g. for vascularized solid tumors, is currently intensely explored. Treatment using desulfated heparin would inhibit the FGF-induced effects in the disease, and it may also affect other factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a heparin binding growth factor acting on endothelial cells (40Ferrara N.

https://openalex.org/W2085428320,"Transcriptional activity in yeast strongly correlates with promoter occupancy by general factors such as TATA binding protein (TBP), TFIIA, and TFIIB, but not with occupancy by TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Thus, TBP exists in at least two transcriptionally active forms in vivo. The TAF-containing form corresponds to the TFIID complex, whereas the form lacking TAFs corresponds to TBP itself or to some other TBP complex. Heat shock treatment altered the relative utilization of these TBP forms, with TFIID being favored. Promoter-specific variations in the association of these distinct forms of TBP may explain why only some yeast genes require TFIID for transcriptional activity in vivo."

However, the events lying downstream of p38 that mediate this protection are unknown. The small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin, which is expressed in only a few cell types, including cardiac myocytes, may participate in MKK6-mediated cytoprotection. In the present study, we showed that, in cultured cardiac myocytes, expression of MKK6(Glu), an active form of MKK6, led to p38-dependent increases in αB-crystallin mRNA, protein, and transcription. MKK6(Glu) also induced p38-dependent activation of the downstream MAPK-activated protein kinase, MAPKAP-K2, and the phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on serine-59. Initially, exposure of cells to the hyperosmotic stressor, sorbitol, stimulated MKK6, p38, and MAPKAP-K2 and increased phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on serine 59. However, after longer times of exposure to sorbitol, the cells began to undergo apoptosis. This sorbitol-induced apoptosis was increased when p38 was inhibited in a manner that would block αB-crystallin induction and phosphorylation. Thus, under these conditions, the activation of MKK6, p38, and MAPKAP-K2 by sorbitol can provide a degree of protection against stress-induced apoptosis. Supporting this view was the finding that sorbitol-induced apoptosis was nearly completely blocked in cells expressing MKK6(Glu). Therefore, the cytoprotective effects of MKK6 in cardiac myocytes are due, in part, to phosphorylation of αB-crystallin on serine 59 and to the induction of αB-crystallin gene expression.

The initial response to most stresses is the induction of intracellular reactions that foster the preservation of cell viability and, thus, organ function. However, if the stress persists, this protective response can be superseded by intracellular events that result in apoptosis or necrosis, leading eventually to deterioration of organ function. The ability of the myocardium to mount a productive stress response is critical for survival. Examples of stresses to which the heart can be exposed in vivo include transient ischemia, cytokines and chemokines, reactive oxygen species, or toxins (1Mann D.L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the absence of a fully functional stress response, these insults could rapidly lead to a devastating loss of cardiac myocytes due to apoptosis and to a decline in tissue function, emphasizing the importance of understanding the cellular and molecular events governing the myocardial stress response. A vital feature of the mechanism by which cardiac myocytes respond to stress is the activation of the stress mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),1 such as p38 MAPK (2Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 3Force T. Hajjar R. Del Monte F. Rosenzweig A. Choukroun G. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar, 4Huot J. Houle F.

Clerk A. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 725-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), an event that mimics the compensatory phase of the myocardial stress response (14Chien K.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Additionally, p38 is stimulated in transgenic mouse models of Ras-induced cardiac hypertrophy (15Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Like other MAPKs, p38 is activated after becoming dually phosphorylated on a critical -Thr-Gly-Tyr- motif (16Ono K. Han J. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is accomplished by an upstream kinase, or a MAPK kinase (MKK). Several MKKs are known to activate p38, as well as some of the other MAPKs. However, among the MAPKs, MKK3 and MKK6 are capable of activating only p38 (17Raingeaud T. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 18Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Initial studies of the role of MKK-activated p38 in the heart showed that the expression of a constitutively activated form of MKK6, MKK6(Glu), induced certain features of the stress response in primary neonatal cardiac myocytes, such as sarcomeric stabilization (12Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) and protection from sphingosine-induced apoptosis (19Zechner D.

Later studies corroborated these results, demonstrating roles for both MKK6 and MKK3 in the cardiac stress response (11Clerk A. Michael A. Sugden P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 523-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The present study is focused on the mechanism by which MKK6 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis, with a particular emphasis on the small heat shock proteins (hsps). Among the best characterized of the small hsps are hsp27 and αB-crystallin. In response to stress, hsp27 is phosphorylated by kinases that lie downstream of p38, notably MAPK-activated protein-K2 (MAPKAP-K2), MAPKAP-K3, and p38-reactive kinase (20Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 21New Liguo Jian Y. Zhao M. Liu K. Zhu W. Flood L.J. Kato Y. Parry G.C.N. Han J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3372-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In endothelial and smooth muscle cells, the phosphorylation of hsp27, which is believed to contribute to protection against stress-induced cell death, correlates temporally with the translocation of hsp27 to actin filaments, where it contributes to stabilization of the cytoskeleton (22Larsen J. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L930-L940PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang P. Bitar K.N. Am. J.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of hsp27 has been shown to foster cell survival, although protection from apoptosis was not demonstrated (26Martin J.L. Mestril R. Hilal-Dandan R. Brunton L.L. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to hsp27, which is expressed in nearly all cell types, a structurally related, small hsp, αB-crystallin, is expressed mainly in the lens, in certain neurons, in skeletal muscle, and, surprisingly, in very high levels in cardiac myocytes (27Longoni S. James P. Chiesi M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 99: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Benjamin I.J. Shelton J. Gerry D.J. Richardson J.A. Dev.

Like hsp27, αB-crystallin in lens cells is post-transcriptionally modified by phosphorylation, and in cultured human glioma cells (U373), αB-crystallin is phosphorylated in response to stressors such as sorbitol (hyperosmotic) or arsenite (31Ito H Okamoto K Nakayama H Isobe T Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29934-29941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that when U373 cells are treated with stressors known to activate p38 and MAPKAP-K2, αB-crystallin is phosphorylated in a site-specific manner on serines located at positions 19, 45, and 59 (32Kato K. Ito H. Kamei K. Inaguma Y. Iwamoto I. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28346-28354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The roles and the kinases responsible for each phosphorylation event remain unknown. Stresses such as ischemia, sorbitol, and arsenite activate p38 and MAPKAP-K2 in the heart and in cultured cardiac myocytes (7Zu Y-L. Ai Y. Gilchrist A. Maulik N. Watras J. Sha'afi R.I. Das Dipak K.

Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In comparison with stress-induced hsp27 translocation to actin filaments in other cell types, in the isolated perfused heart, ischemic stress induces αB-crystallin translocation from a diffuse, cytosolic localization to sarcomeres (34Golenhofen N. Ness W. Koob R. Htun P. Schaper W. Drenckhahn D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1457-H1464PubMed Google Scholar). This translocation was shown to be temporally coordinated with increased αB-crystallin phosphorylation, although the identities of phosphorylated residues have not been established (35Golenhofen N. Htun P. Ness W. Koob R. Schaper W. Drenckhahn D. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 569-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since hsp27 translocates to and stabilizes actin filaments in endothelial and smooth muscle cells (4Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar,23Wang P. Bitar K.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1454-G1462PubMed Google Scholar), the sarcomeric localization of αB-crystallin could foster myofilament stabilization in stressed cardiac myocytes. Since myofilament disintegration takes place in cardiac myocytes during hypoxia, which leads to apoptosis (36Ganote C.E. Van der Heide R.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 129: 327-344PubMed Google Scholar), the sarcomeric translocation of αB-crystallin could be important for protecting myocytes against apoptosis. Consistent with this possibility is the finding that overexpression of αB-crystallin increased cardiac myocyte survival during ischemia (26Martin J.L. Mestril R. Hilal-Dandan R. Brunton L.L. Dillmann W.H. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although apoptosis was not assessed in that study. The mechanisms responsible for the tissue-restricted expression of αB-crystallin are largely unknown. However, the αB-crystallin promoter possesses a serum response element (SRE) (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Haynes J.I. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7081-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that is homologous to SREs in other stress-induced cardiac genes (e.g. ANF (39Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). Thus, it is plausible that αB-crystallin expression is induced in concert with other SRE-containing cardiac genes in response to stress and that the increased levels of αB-crystallin contribute to myocardial protection. Moreover, it is possible that stress-mediated activation of the p38 pathway can induce the selective, site-specific phosphorylation of αB-crystallin and that this phosphorylation may be critical for optimal αB-crystallin-mediated cytoprotection. These hypotheses were tested in the present study using a well characterized cultured cell model system for evaluating the response of cardiac myocytes to stress and activated MKK6. Primary ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1–4-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described (12Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 39Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were dissected in DMEM/air; the apical two-thirds of the ventricles were dissected away from the atria. After mincing and washing the ventricles twice with air-compatible DMEM, cells were isolated by multiple rounds of 10-min-long tissue dissociation with 0.001% trypsin. After each incubation with trypsin, the supernatant was added to an equal volume of DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and all of the supernatants were combined. Plastic wells were treated for at least 1 h with 5 ng of fibronectin/ml of DMEM/F-12 (1:1). Myocytes, which, in some experiments, were derived from the nonadherent cells in a 1-h preplating on untreated plastic dishes, were plated finally in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing 10% fetal bovine serum for approximately 16 h. After this time, cultures were washed with DMEM/F-12 (1:1) and then incubated in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) containing bovine serum albumin at 1 g/liter (minimal medium) with or without any test agents for the indicated times. Northern analyses were performed as described previously (39Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. RNA was isolated from 3 × 106 myocytes using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) as described by the manufacturer. Five μg of each sample were fractionated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and then transferred to Hybond Nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were cross-linked and then incubated with radioactive probes in QuikHyb (Stratagene, Inc., Madison, WI). The αB-crystallin probe was prepared by digesting a rat αB-crystallin cDNA (cLens/pBluescript(−) from Dr. J. Piatigorsky, National Institutes of Health) with EcoRI/HindIII to generate a 730-bp fragment of the αB-crystallin cDNA. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe was prepared by digesting a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (ATCC 78105) with EcoRI to generate a 1.2-kilobase pair fragment. cDNA fragments were then labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using Klenow fragment and standard protocols. Cultures composed of approximately 106 myocytes were lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm sodiumo-vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin and boiled for 5 min. Eighty μl of each lysate were analyzed for phosphospecific αB-crystallin, and 5 μl of each lysate were analyzed for total αB-crystallin. Proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in methanol transfer buffer at 60 V for 5 h or 30 V overnight. Membranes were blocked for 30 min in 5% nonfat milk dissolved in TBS-Tween (0.01%) at room temperature and then probed with rabbit affinity-purified αB-crystallin antisera specific for phosphorylation at serine 19, 45, or 59. All αB-crystallin antisera were generously provided by Dr. Kanefusa Kato (Institute for Developmental Research, Japan). The αB-crystallin phosphoserine-specific antisera were used at 1 μg/ml for phosphoserine 19 and at 0.5 μg/ml for phosphoserines 45 and 59; the antisera were diluted into 5% nonfat milk TBS-Tween. Blots were incubated with this mixture for 2 h at room temperature. Some blots were incubated with an affinity-purified αB-crystallin antiserum raised against the C terminus of αB-crystallin, which was used at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. This antiserum recognizes all phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of αB-crystallin, thus serving as a measure of the total amount of αB-crystallin in a sample. Following incubation with the αB-crystallin antisera, blots were washed for 30 min in TBS-Tween and then incubated in a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) followed by washing for 30 min in TBS-Tween. Visualization of immune complexes were carried out by an enhanced chemiluminescence method using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cultures composed of approximately 2 × 106 myocytes were lysed in 100 μl of supplemented Laemmli sample buffer (see above), boiled for 5 min, and then submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (see above). Western analyses were performed as described above with 1:1000 dilutions of antisera specific for either phospho-p38 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA; catalog no. 9211S). Blots were subsequently stripped with 6.25 mm Tris, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, washed for 1 h in TBS-Tween, and reprobed with 1:1000 dilution of p38 antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada; catalog no. KAP-MAOO9E) for normalization. Immediately following the final dissociation step, myocardial cells were resuspended in serum-free DMEM:F-12 (1:1). Between 5 and 12 × 106 cells were combined with the indicated amounts of plasmids in a total volume of 300 μl of DMEM/F-12 (1:1). The total amount of plasmid used for each electroporation in one experiment was equalized using pCMV6. Cells were electroporated at 500 V, 25 microfarads, and 100 ohms in a 0.2-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Under these conditions, only cardiac myocytes are transfected (39Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension. 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For reporter assays, 1.5 × 106 cells were plated per 24-mm well, whereas 4.5 × 106 myocytes per 35-mm well were plated to perform kinase assays. For adenovirus experiments, cultures were preplated for 1.5 h, and then, following culturing of the myocytes overnight in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (see above), they were infected with AdV-Con, AdV-MKK6(Glu), AdV-p38α(AGF) for 5 h, as described previously (41Craig R.C. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) and was obtained from R. J. Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). pcDNA3 FLAG-p38α was obtained originally from J. Han (The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). Using site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene, Inc., Madison, WI), Thr181 and Tyr183 of p38α were converted to Ala and Phe, respectively. pGEX-6P-1/3XHA p38β2 (K53R) was derived from p38β2(wt) (B. Stein, Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) via polymerase chain reaction primers with 5′-(EcoRI) + 3XHA tag and 3′-ter(NotI). The murine αB-crystallin promoters, −426 to +44 and −164 to +44, in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs were obtained from Dr. J. Piatigorsky (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Haynes J.I. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7081-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were recloned into the Luciferase construct, pGL2 (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), by subcloning into the BamHI site of pBluescriptII KS+ (Stratagene) and subsequently cloning into pGL2 using EcoRI and HindIII sites. Myocytes were transfected by electroporation with 30 μg of pcDNA3 FLAG-MKK6(wt), as described above, using 9 × 106 cells per transfection. Transfected myocytes were plated, and after 48 h in minimal media, cultures were treated with 400 mm sorbitol or 0.5 mm arsenite for 5 min and then extracted in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm sodium o-vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation. Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) per sample. Forty μl of a protein G-Sepharose slurry were then added to each sample and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The Sepharose pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer and once with preincubation buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT). Kinase reactions were performed using 2 μg of GST-3XHA p38β2(see below) per reaction as substrate in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 20 μm ATP, and 6 μm[γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol). After 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the phosphorylation level of substrate proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and phosphor image analyses. A kinase-inactive form of human p38β2(p38β2(K53R)), which retains the native sites that are phosphorylated by MKK6 (Thr181 and Tyr183), was used as the substrate for MKK6 kinase assays. To prepare this protein, the plasmid, pGEX-6P-1/3XHA p38β2(K53R), was transformed into BL-21-competent cells (Stratagene, Inc., Madison, WI; catalog no. 200133). Cultures were grown in 2× YTA medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 12–15 h until A 600 = 2.0. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma; catalog no. I-5502), at 30 °C and with shaking at 150 rpm for 6 h. Cells were the collected by centrifugation at 6000 × gfor 10 min and then resuspended in 50 ml of buffer G (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm EDTA, 5 mmbenzamidine, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) per liter of culture. The resuspended cells were sonicated using a Branson 450 sonifier, at setting 5 for 15–30 s. Triton X-100 was added to 0.1% after sonication, and the sonicate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Recombinant GST-3XHA p38β2(K53R) was then purified from the crude cell extract using a Bulk GST Purification Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.; catalog no. 27-4570-01), essentially as described in the accompanying protocol. Briefly, 1 ml of 50% glutathione-Sepharose was added per 100 ml of sonicate and incubated on ice for 1–2 h. The Sepharose was pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed three times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) in fractions of 1 ml/500 μl of Sepharose. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 2 liters of dialysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7; 200 mm NaCl; 200 μm EDTA; 2 mm DTT). The purification of p38β2(K53R) was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomasie Blue, coupled with Western analyses using an anti-HA antiserum. Final protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad; catalog no. 500-0116). Cultures were extracted in 400 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium o-vanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following removal of debris by centrifugation, MAPKAP-K2 was immunoprecipitated using 1.5 μg of anti-MAPKAP-K2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY; catalog no. 06-534) and submitted to a kinase assay using [γ-32P]ATP and hsp27 as the substrates, as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled hsp27 was then resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was then submitted to phosphor image analyses. The AdEasy system was used for preparing recombinant adenoviral strains using previously described methods (41Craig R.C. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C.

Briefly, human MKK6(Glu) and human p38α(AGF) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the parent templates (see above) such as to create restriction sites that would facilitate cloning into pAdTrack-CMV, an adenoviral shuttle vector that harbors CMV-driven green fluorescent protein, and a CMV-flanked multiple cloning site for the insertion of the gene of interest. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified p38α(AGF) and MKK6(Glu) were cloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which served as a shuttle cloning vector. pGEX-6P-1/p38α(AGF) and pGEX-6P-1/MKK6(Glu) were then digested with BamHI and NotI, and the resulting products of interest were cloned into the BglII and NotI sites of pAdTrack-CMV to create pAdTrack-CMV-p38α(AGF) and pAdTrack-CMV-MKK6(Glu). pAdTrack-CMV-p38α(AGF) or pAdTrack-CMV-MKK6(Glu) was linearized and then co-transformed with the adenoviral vector, pAdEasy-1, into Escherichia colistrain BJ5183. This strain of E. coli allows for homologous recombination of pAdEasy-1 and the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector containing the gene of interest. Recombinants were selected on kanamycin and screened by restriction digestion with PacI. Recombinant plasmids were then retransformed into E. coliDH5α for propagation purposes. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were linearized with PacI and then transfected into 293 human embryonic kidney cells, using LipofectAMINE® (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfection efficiency was determined by observing green fluorescent protein fluorescence, as described previously (41Craig R.C. Larkin A. Mingo A.M. Thuerauf D.J. Andrews C. McDonough P.M.

https://openalex.org/W2141322853,"Infection of HeLa cells with adenovirus-carrying HSF1+ cDNA, which encodes a mutated form of HSF1 with constitutive transactivation capacity, increased multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) mRNA level and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) cell surface content and stimulated rhodamine 123 accumulation and vinblastine efflux activity. On the other hand, infection with adenovirus-carrying HSP70 andHSP27 cDNAs did not increase MDR1/P-gp expression. HSF1 regulates MDR1/P-gp expression at the transcriptional level, since HSF1+ bound the heat-shock consensus elements (HSEs) in the MDR1 gene promoter and also activated the expression of an MDR1 promoter-driven reporter plasmid (pMDR1(−1202)). In addition, heat-shock increased pMDR1(−1202) promoter activity but not the activity of a similar reporter plasmid with point mutations at specific HSEs, and the heat-induced increase was totally inhibited by co-transfection with an expression plasmid carrying HSF1−, a dominant negative mutant of HSF1. The stress inducers arsenite, butyrate, and etoposide also increased pMDR1(−1202) promoter activity, but the increase was not inhibited (in the case of butyrate) or was only partially inhibited (in the case of arsenite and etoposide) by HSF1−.

One of the mechanisms that may account for MDR is the surface accumulation of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp, also called the multidrug transporter), which blocks the influx and/or increases the efflux of many hydrophobic agents, including some of the most commonly used anticancer drugs (for a review, see Ref. 1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 62: 385-427Crossref Scopus (3577) Google Scholar). In humans, P-gp is encoded by the MDR gene family, composed of two members, only one of which (MDR1) seems to be functionally linked to the development of the MDR phenotype (2Roninson I.B. Chin J.E. Choi K. Gros P. Housman D.E. Fojo A. Shen D.W. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4538-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). P-gp is expressed in some normal tissues, such as epithelial cells of kidney, liver, pancreas, and intestinal mucosa and capillaries of brain and testis. In these tissues, P-gp probably plays a physiological role, promoting the excretion of xenobiotics or preventing their absorption and also possibly acting as a chloride channel (reviewed in Refs. 1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 62: 385-427Crossref Scopus (3577) Google Scholar and 3Nooter K. Herweijer H. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 63: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As a consequence, cancers derived from these tissues may constitutively express P-gp and be intrinsically drug-resistant. However, in most cases P-gp-derived resistance is acquired during chemotherapy,e.g. in breast, bladder, lung, and ovary tumors, among others (for a review, see Ref. 3Nooter K. Herweijer H. Br. J.

In fact, (a) HSEs have been identified in theMDR1 gene promoter (11Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kioka N. Yamano Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); (b) typical stress inducers such as heat-shock and arsenite, which induce HSPgene expression, also induce MDR1 gene expression in some cell types (11Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kioka N. Yamano Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); (c) some multidrug-resistant cell lines exhibit constitutively high HSF-DNA binding activity (19Kim S.H. Hur W.Y. Kang C.D. Lim Y.S. Kim D.W. Chung B.S. Cancer Lett. 1997; 115: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); and (d) quercetin, which inhibits HSF-HSE binding, also inhibits HSF-DNA binding and P-gp expression in multidrug-resistant cells (20Kim S.H. Yeo G.S. Lim Y.S. Kang C.D. Kim C.M. Chung B.S. Exp. Mol. Med. 1998; 30: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the problem is far from being clear, since (a) some work suggests that the activation of MDR1 expression by heat-shock and other stressing agents may be mediated by DNA sequences and transcription factors other than HSE and HSFs (21Miyazaki M. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Tanimura H. Matsuo K.I. Nasu M. Kuwano M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Asakuno K. Kohno K. Uchiumi T. Kubo T.

In the present work, we analyzed the regulation of MDR1 gene expression by HSF1 using direct gene transfer procedures. This was made possible by the use of specific HSF1 mutants, namely a construction encoding an active mutant (HSF1+) (a deleted form of HSF1 with constitutive binding and transactivation capacities) and a construction encoding a dominant negative mutant (HSF1−) (a deleted form that constitutively binds the HSP gene promoters but is unable to transactivate, even under stressing conditions) (18Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All components for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Life Technologies). Sodium arsenite and sodium butyrate were obtained from Merck, and etoposide was from Sigma. Human HeLa cells and human 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Sodium arsenite and sodium butyrate were dissolved before use in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 100 mm. Etoposide was dissolved in Me2SO at 20 mm and stored at −20 °C. For treatments, HeLa cells were either placed in a bath for 2 h at 43 °C and then allowed to recover for 4 h at 37 °C; treated for 4 h with 100 μm sodium arsenite and then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium and allowed to recover for 4 h in the absence of the drug; or continuously treated for 24 h with 5 mm sodium butyrate or 200 μm etoposide. Expression plasmids were derived from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) by insertion of cDNA genes for human HSF1 (HSF1wt), HSF1d202–316 (HSF1+), or bacterial β-galactosidase or derived from pcDNA1 (Invitrogen Corp.) by insertion of the cDNA gene for human HSF1d453–523 (HSF1−) (see Ref. 18Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar and references therein). The reporter plasmid pMDR1(−1202) was produced by inserting a MDR1 promoter sequence (−1202 to +118) into the luciferase vector pGL2B (Promega, Madison, WI) (24Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the −315 to −285 sequence of the MDR1 promoter was made by sequential polymerase chain reaction steps from plasmid pMDR1(−1202). The original sequence 5′-GCCAGAACATTCCTCCTGGAAATTCAACCTG-3′ was changed to 5′-GCCAGGACATCCCTCCTGGAAATCCAACCTG-3′, where the mutated bases are underlined. For this purpose, complementary oligonucleotides A (5′-GCCAGGACATCCCTCCTGGAAATCCAA-3′) and B (5′-CAGGTTGGATTTCCAGGAGGGATGTC-3′) were designed. At the same time, oligonucleotides F (5′-GTAACTGAGCTAACATAAC-3′) and R (5′-TTACTTAGATCTCGAGCTAGC-3′), corresponding to the polylinker flanking regions of plasmid pGL2B, were also synthesized and used as primers. Using the pMDR1(−1202) plasmid as a template, single PCRs with A and R, as well as B and F primers were performed. The amplification products were annealed with each other and extended by mutually primed synthesis. The fragment was then amplified by a second PCR step, in the presence of primers F and R. The product was digested with SmaI and inserted into pGL2B. The resulting reporter plasmid was designated as pMDR(−1202)mut. The site-directed mutagenesis was verified by DNA sequencing. pHSP70-luc, a plasmid containing a highly inducible human HSP70B promoter-driven luciferase gene, was kindly supplied by Dr. R. Voellmy (Dept. of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL). Transfection was performed using the LipofectAMINETMreagent (Life Technologies). Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well. The next day, the cells were incubated for 5 h with 1 ml of culture medium containing 225 ng of either pGL2B, pMDR1(−1202), pHSP70-luc, or pMDR1(−1202)mut plasmids, 225 ng of expression plasmids (when required), 50 ng of the β-galactosidase plasmid, and 2 μl of LipofectAMINETMreagent. Following transfection, the mixture was removed, and the cells were incubated under standard conditions for 16 h, after which they were either harvested or subjected to heat-shock. Luciferase assays were performed using a Luciferase Assay System Freezer-1 Pack kit (Promega) and a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA), the values being normalized in relation to protein concentration. Internal normalization of the transfection efficacy was performed using a chemiluminiscent reporter gene assay system to detect β-galactosidase (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Recombinant adenovirus vectors were generated by co-transfection of human 293 cells with plasmid AC CMV pLpa SR(−) containing, or not containing, the cDNAs for human HSF1d202–316 (Ade-HSF1+), inducible rat HSP70 (Ade-HSP70), or human HSP27 (Ade-HSP27), and the infectious plasmid JM17 (25Mestril R.

Cell Stress Chaperon. 1999; 4: 8-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells (at about 50% confluence) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10 PFU/cell. The cells were detached from culture dishes by a brief incubation with PBS containing 0.04% EDTA at 37 °C, after which they were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in PBS at the desired concentration. For determination of P-gp surface expression, indirect immunofluorescence assays were carried out using a mouse anti-human P-gp mAb (clone UIC2, Immunotech, Marseille, France). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the mAb and then washed three times with PBS and incubated again for 15 min at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After washing the cells, the fluorescence was estimated by flow cytometry, using an EPICS KL flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL) The rhodamine 123 accumulation assay was carried out exactly as described by Frommel et al. (28Frommel T, O. Coon J.S. Tsuruo T. Roninson I.B. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The procedure was basically the same as described by Frommel et al. (28Frommel T, O. Coon J.S. Tsuruo T. Roninson I.B. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After 24 h of infection, triplicate cell samples were labeled for 18 h in culture medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]vinblastine (12.5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then washed three times with PBS and incubated again with fresh, [3H]vinblastine-free culture medium. At 15, 30, and 60 min, the whole medium was removed and replaced, and aliquots of the medium were used to determine the amount of effluxed vinblastine by scintillation counting. To determine the amount of vinblastine remaining in the cells, at the end of the experiment the cells were washed and lysed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. These data were used to determine the percentage of vinblastine associated with the cells at each time point. Cell lysis, electrophoretic separation, blotting onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and immunological detection of proteins were carried out essentially as described previously (29Vilaboa N.E. Calle C. Pérez C. De Blas E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2877-2993PubMed Google Scholar). The antibodies used were mouse anti-human HSP70 monoclonal antibody (clone C92F3A-5; StressGen BiotechnologiesCorp., Victoria, Canada); mouse anti-human HSP27 monoclonal antibody (clone G3.1; StressGen); and mouse anti-chicken β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was prepared using an Ultraspect-II RNA isolation kit (Biotech Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX), following the procedure described by the manufacturer. All other conditions, including the source and preparation of theHSP70- specific cDNA probe, were as described previously (30Garcı́a-Bermejo L. Vilaboa N.E. Pérez C. De Blas E. Calle C. Aller P. Leukemia Res. 1995; 19: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Other probes were the 1.4-kilobaseMDR1-specific EcoRI fragment of pHDR54 plasmid (Ref. 31Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar; American Type Culture Collection, number 61361) and the entire pTRI RNA 28S plasmid, which recognizes 28 S rRNA (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described by Zuo et al. (18Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The partially complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GCGAAACCCCTGGAATATTCCCGACCTGGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCCAGGTCGGGAATATTCCAGGGGTTTCG-3′ (corresponding to the humanHSP70 promoter) (32Wu B. Kinsgton R.E. Morimoto R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); 5′-GCCAGAACATTCCTCCTGGAAATTCAA-3′ and 5′-CAGGTTGAATTTCCAGGAGGAATGTT-3′ (corresponding to the human MDR1 promoter) (11Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 5′-GCCAGGACATCCCTCCTGGAAATCCAA-3′ and 5′-CAGGTTGGATTTCCAGGAGGGATGTC-3′ (corresponding to a mutated MDR1 promoter); and 5′-GGCTAGTGATGAGTCAAGCCGGATC-3′ and 5′-GGGATCCGGCTTGACTCATCACTAG-3′ (containing AP-1 binding sites) were prepared and, when required, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP as earlier reported (29Vilaboa N.E. Calle C. Pérez C. De Blas E. Garcı́a-Bermejo L. Aller P. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2877-2993PubMed Google Scholar). For binding reactions, cell extracts containing 5 μg of proteins were mixed with 10 μl of Kingston buffer (120 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.24 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm 1, 4-dithiothreitol, 0.6 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 24% (v/v) glycerol, 24 mmHEPES, pH 7.9), 4 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and water to a final volume of 18 μl. After preincubating for 15 min on ice, 2 μl of labeled probe (approximately 10,000 cpm) was added, and the incubation followed for 15 min at room temperature. To prove the specificity of binding, when required the reactions were carried out in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled HSP70, MDR1, or AP-1 probes or in the presence of anti-HSF1 antibody (rabbit anti-human HSF1 polyclonal antibody; StressGen) or preimmune serum. The samples were electrophoresed in 4.5% native polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and autoradiographed. It was earlier reported that the HSF1+ mutant was able to constitutively induce the expression of endogenous HSP genes in the absence of stress (27Xia W. Vilaboa N. Martin J.J. Mestril R. Guo Y. Voellmy R. Cell Stress Chaperon. 1999; 4: 8-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, this mutant was used to investigate whether HSF1 regulatesMDR1/P-gp expression. With this in mind, we measured the MDR1 RNA level at different times after infection with Ade-HSF1+. It was observed that HSF1+ caused an increase in MDR1 RNA level, which was first detected at 12 h of infection and followed thereafter (Fig.1 A). Ade-HSF1+infection also increased HSP70 mRNA level (included as a positive control), but in this case the increase was already detected at 6 h (Fig. 1 A). MDR1 and HSP70 mRNAs were undetectable in both noninfected cells and cells only infected with the viral vector (Ade-infected cells). The HSF1+-mediated induction ofMDR1/P-gp expression was corroborated at the protein level. In fact, a clear increase in P-gp cell surface accumulation could be detected at 24 h (result not shown) and 48 h of infection with Ade-HSF1+, when compared with noninfected and Ade-infected cells (Fig. 1 B). Since the increase in HSP70 mRNA level apparently preceded the increase in MDR1 RNA level in Ade-HSF1+-infected cells (Fig. 1 A), we questioned whether the HSF1-provoked stimulation of MDR1/P-gp expression could be a mere consequence of HSP accumulation. To investigate this possibility, cells were infected with Ade-HSF1+ as well as with viral vectors carrying inducible HSP70 and HSP27 cDNAs (Ade-HSP70 and Ade-HSP27, respectively). Immunoblot assays using anti-HSP70 and anti-HSP27 antibodies proved that, as expected, infection with Ade-HSP70 increased the level of HSP70 protein; infection with Ade-HSP27 increased the level of HSP27 protein; infection with Ade-HSF1+ increased the level of both HSP70 and HSP27; and Ade-infection was ineffective (Fig. 2 A). When P-gp cell surface expression was measured, it was found to be greatly increased by Ade-HSF1+ infection but only slightly augmented by Ade-HSP70 and Ade-HSP27 infection (Fig. 2 B). RNA blot assays confirmed the increase in MDR1 mRNA by Ade-HSF1+ but not by Ade-HSP70 or Ade-HSP27 (Fig. 2 C). Hence, the increase in MDR1/P-gp expression in HSF1+-infected cells may not be adequately explained as a consequence of HSPs accumulation. Earlier reports indicated that P-gp cell surface expression could be increased without modification in drug accumulation and/or efflux (33Bates S.E. Mickley L.A. Chen Y.N. Ritchert N. Rudick J. Biedler J.L. Fojo A.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4337-4344Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 34Mickley L.A. Bates S.E. Richert N.D. Currier S. Tanaka S. Foss F. Rosen N. Fojo A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18031-18040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the functionality of the HSF1-mediated increase in P-gp, we comparatively measured rhodamine accumulation as well as vinblastine efflux activity in Ade-infected and Ade-HSF1+-infected cells. Some of the obtained results are indicated in Fig. 3. Under the used experimental conditions, a subpopulation of cells with decreased rhodamine 123 accumulation was observed in Ade-HSF1+-infected cultures, in comparison with Ade-infected cultures (Fig. 3 A). In a similar manner, Ade-HSF1+ infection accelerated the rate of vinblastine efflux, when compared with Ade-infected cultures (Fig. 3 B). Hence, HSF1 activity sufficed to stimulate the expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype, as measured by altered P-gp transport activity. We queried whether the HSF1-mediated increase in MDR1/P-gp expression was regulated at the transcriptional level. This was first investigated by means of gel shift assays, using a MDR1 promoter-derived oligonucleotide. Although the MDR1 promoter contains multiple HSEs (11Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was reported that those present in the −315 to −285 region seem to mediate the induction of MDR1 by arsenite, an inducer of the stress response (12Kioka N. Yamano Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and hence this sequence was selected as the MDR1 probe (MDR1wt probe) (Fig.4 A). In addition, a similar sequence in which point mutations at the HSEs were introduced (MDR1mut probe) and a HSE-containing HSP70 promoter-derived oligonucleotide (HSP70 probe) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The obtained results are represented in Fig. 4 B. Extracts from Ade-HSF+-infected cells bound the MDR1wt probe with a similar pattern as in the case of the HSP70 probe, while no binding was observed using the the MDR1mut probe. The binding to the MDR1wt and HSP70 probes was specific, since it was not detected when using extracts of Ade-infected cells or when the incubation was carried out in the presence of anti-HSF1 antibody or excess homologous (MDR1wt or HSP70) probes. On the other hand, it was not affected by excess MDR1mut or heterologous (AP-1) probes. The results obtained by gel shift assays were corroborated and extended by transient transfection assays. For this purpose, we used aMDR1 promoter-driven luciferase gene construction (pMDR1(−1202) plasmid) and a similar construction with the same point mutations in the −315 to −285 region, which disrupted HSF1+ binding (pMDR1(−1202)mut plasmid). It was found that pMDR1(−1202) activity was greatly increased by co-transfection with HSF1+, while the same assay caused a much lower increase of pMDR1(−1202)mut activity (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HSF1 regulates MDR1expression at the transcriptional level and suggest that the HSE sites located in the −315 to −285 region are critical for such a transcriptional regulation. While the preceding results demonstrated that MDR1/P-gp expression is susceptible to regulation by HSF1, they did not prove that HSF1 is in fact responsible for MDR1 induction under stressing conditions. To investigate this possibility, cells transfected with either pMDR1(−1202) or pMDR1(−1202)mut were subjected to heat-shock, which is the most typical stress inducer. It was observed that heat effectively increased pMDR1(−1202) promoter activity but not pMDR1(−1202)mut activity (Fig.6 A). This proved that the HSEs present in the −315 to −285 region are specifically required for the heat-provoked induction of MDR1 expression. As a second experimental approach, heat-shock was applied to cells co-transfected with pMDR1(−1202) plus one of the following expression plasmids: HSF1 wild type (HSF1wt), which binds the HSE but does not transactivate in the absence of stress (18Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); a dominant negative HSF1 (HSF1−); or the empty vector (pcDNA3.1). The results are represented in Fig. 6 B. It was observed that heat-shock activated pMDR1(−1202) promoter activity in both pcDNA3.1- and HSF1wt-transfected cells, while the activation was totally inhibited by HSF1− transfection. In addition, it was observed that the basal pMDR1(−1202) activity reached similar values in nonheated HSF1wt-transfected and pcDNA3.1-transfected cells. Taken together, these results indicate that HSF1 mediates the heat-provoked activation of MDR1 expression and that the mere binding of HSF1 does not suffice to transactivate the MDR1 promoter, as was reported in the case of HSP gene promoters (18Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Finally, we wanted to know whether HSF1 could also mediate the induction of MDR1/P-gp by other agents. With this aim, cells co-transfected with pMDR1(−1202) plus either HSF1− or pcDNA3.1 were treated with the stress inducer sodium arsenite, the differentiation inducer sodium butyrate, and the antitumor drug etoposide, all of which were reported to activate MDR1expression in different cell types (10Chaudary P.M. Roninson I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 11Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol.

Currier S. Tanaka S. Foss F. Rosen N. Fojo A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18031-18040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel determinations were carried out using a HSP70promoter-driven reporter plasmid (pHSP70-luc) instead of pMDR1 (−1202). The obtained results are indicated in Fig.7. It was observed that arsenite, butyrate and etoposide increased HSP70 promoter activity, and the increase was totally inhibited by co-transfection with HSF1− (Fig. 7 A). In this sense, not only arsenite, but also butyrate and etoposide, may be strictly considered inducers of the stress response. These agents also increased pMDR1(−1202) promoter activity, but in this case the increase was not inhibited (butyrate) or was only partially inhibited (arsenite and etoposide) by HSF1− (Fig. 7 B). The role of MDR1/P-gp expression as one of the main determinants of the MDR phenotype is of great importance in understanding the mechanisms of the regulation of this gene and to generate strategies to inhibit its expression and/or function. The human MDR1 promoter contains multiple elements, which point to a complex regulation. Thus, it has been demonstrated thatMDR1 is susceptible to positive regulation by the Sp1 (35Cornwell M.M.

A. 1997; 94: 11037-11042Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although earlier reports identified the presence of HSEs in the MDR1promoter, the present work provides the first direct demonstration that HSF1 regulates MDR1/P-gp expression and drug transport activity. Moreover, the HSF1-mediated regulation of MDR1exhibits some characteristics earlier reported for HSP genes, such as activation by heat-shock and separate regulation of the HSF1 binding and transactivation capacities (18Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This indicates thatMDR1 may be strictly considered a stress gene. However, the present results also indicate that the regulation of MDR1and HSP70 by stress inducers is not identical and suggest that factors other than HSF1 may account, at least in part, for the induction of MDR1 by some stressing agents. In fact, while HSF1 sufficed to explain the activation of the HSP70promoter by butyrate, arsenite, and etoposide, this factor was either irrelevant (in the case of butyrate) or insufficient (in the case or arsenite and etoposide) to fully explain the activation of theMDR1 promoter by these agents. In this regard, a recent report indicated that the activation of the MDR1 promoter by butyrate is mediated by the NF-Y (24Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and our preliminary observations indicate that its activation by etoposide is partially regulated by AP-1. 2N. E. Vilaboa, A. Galán, A. Troyano, E. de Blas, and P. Aller, unpublished results. Although the only goal of the present work was to analyze theMDR1 gene regulation by HSF1, the obtained results may also have some clinical relevance. Among the different strategies conceived to overcome the P-gp-mediated MDR (for a review, see Ref. 44Sonneveld P. Wiemer E. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1997; 9: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), those commonly used consist in the administration of agents such as verapamil, cyclosporin A, and related compounds, which bind P-gp and block its transport activity. By contrast, the attempts to specifically inhibit MDR1 expression have been of little effect until now. In this regard, our present results indicate that it could be possible to prevent MDR1/P-gp expression by inhibiting HSF1-HSE binding or HSF1-directed transactivation. For instance, antitumor drugs rapidly induce MDR1/P-gp expression in cultured cells (10Chaudary P.M. Roninson I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), and MDR1/P-gp is actually increased after chemotherapy in different cancers (e.g. acute leukemia, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma, among others). If such induction is mediated at least in part by HSF1, as indicated by our experiments using etoposide, then it could be attenuated by gene transfer procedures using the HSF1−mutant. The same procedure might help to prevent MDR1induction by other stressful albeit common clinical situations (e.g. fever, which might mimic in vivo the effect of heat-shock in vitro). Moreover, HSF1− might help to prevent the undesirable induction of HSPs expression. This later aspect is also interesting, since HSP70 and other HSPs may reduce the lethality of antitumor drugs and other cytotoxic insults by preventing apoptosis (for a review, see Ref. 45Jäätelä M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) and hence provide an alternative mechanism for drug resistance. A detailed analysis of the involvement of HSF1 in the regulation of MDR1/P-gp expression in different tumor cells, and of the different factors that may contribute to drug resistance is required to define the feasibility of this hypothesis.

We observed an active lava lake, an active curtain of lava, active lava flows, calderas, mountains, plateaus, and plains. Several of the sulfur dioxide-rich plumes are erupting from distal flows, rather than from the source of silicate lava (caldera or fissure, often with red pyroclastic deposits). Most of the active flows in equatorial regions are being emplaced slowly beneath insulated crust, but rapidly emplaced channelized flows are also found at all latitudes. There is no evidence for high-viscosity lava, but some bright flows may consist of sulfur rather than mafic silicates. The mountains, plateaus, and calderas are strongly influenced by tectonics and gravitational collapse. Sapping channels and scarps suggest that many portions of the upper approximately 1 kilometer are rich in volatiles."

https://openalex.org/W2058872839,"DnaJ is an essential cochaperone of mammalian heat shock cognate 70 (hsc70) protein. We previously found that dj2 (HSDJ/hdj-2/rdj1), rather than dj1 (hsp40/hdj-1), is a partner DnaJ for the hsc70-based chaperone system. Here, we compared the distribution of dj1, dj2, and the newly found dj3 (cpr3/DNJ3/HIRIP4/rdj2) in cultured cells. Both dj3 as well as dj2 were farnesylated and were ubiquitously expressed. In immunocytochemical and subfractionation studies, these two proteins colocalized with hsc70 under normal conditions. However, dj1 and hsc70 apparently colocalized in the nucleoli after heat shock. Simultaneous depletion of dj2 and dj3 from rabbit reticulocyte lysate markedly reduced mitochondrial import of pre-ornithine transcarbamylase and refolding of guanidine-denatured luciferase. Re-addition of either dj2 or dj3 led to recovery of these reactions. In a reconstituted system, both hsc70-dj2 and hsc70-dj3 were effective in protein refolding. Anti-apoptotic protein bag-1 further stimulated ATP hydrolysis and protein refolding by both pairs. Thus, dj2 and dj3 are the partner DnaJs of hsc70 within the cell, functionally similar and much more efficient than dj1, and bag-1 is a positive cochaperone of the hsc70-dj2 and hsc70-dj3 systems."

The records allow the visualization of the propagation of long-period ground motion in the basin and show the refraction of surface waves at the basin edge. The refracted wave does not travel directly from the earthquake epicenter, but traverses the basin obliquely to the edge. The surface wave inside the basin propagates more slowly than that outside such that the wavefronts separate from each other, and the refracted wave heals the discrepancy in the speed of advance of the wavefronts inside and outside the basin. The refracted arrival is dominant near the edge of the Kanto basin."

Generation of Aβ from APP requires two sequential proteolytic events: an initial cleavage at the amino terminus of the Aβ sequence referred to as β-secretase (4Seubert P. Oltersdorf T. Lee M.G.

Recently, a membrane-bound aspartic protease has been implicated as a β-secretase (5Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M.

However, the protease(s) responsible for γ-secretase cleavage have not been identified. In addition, a third proteolytic activity referred to as α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ sequence to release a large secreted derivative (sAPP), thus precluding formation of full-length Aβ. In mammalian cells, at least two members of the ADAM family (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) can contribute to the α-secretase activity (9Buxbaum J.D. Liu K.N. Luo Y. Slack J.L. Stocking K.L.

Although full-length APP is not cleaved by γ-secretase, APP carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTF) generated through cleavage of APP by either α- or β-secretase are both substrates for γ-secretase, with cleavage of CTFα releasing a peptide referred to as p3 (Aβ17-40 or Aβ17-42) (1Busciglio J.

Science. 1992; 258: 126-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). γ-Secretase-catalyzed cleavages are of particular interest for a number of reasons. First, they are unusual in that the cleavage site of the substrate is predicted to lie within the transmembrane domain (TMD). Rather than primary amino acid sequence, position of the γ-cleavage site with respect to the membrane appears to be the prime determinant of cleavage, with the length of the luminal TMD determining that position (11Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Whether γ-secretase actually cleaves residues within the membrane is a controversial topic. To date, there is no definitive evidence showing that any protease can cleave bonds when they are buried within a TMD. Second, altered γ-secretase cleavage is implicated in the development of AD (reviewed in Ref. 12Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). FAD-linked mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PS1), and PS2 alter γ-secretase activity by increasing the amount of a minor Aβ species, the more amyloidogenic Aβ42, without significantly altering total Aβ production. Significantly, both PS1 knockout and presenilin aspartate mutants decrease γ-secretase cleavage, but it is not known if this is a direct or indirect effect (13De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Third, APP CTF are not the only substrate for γ-secretase activity: CTF generated after ligand-induced cleavage of the extracellular domain of Notch are cleaved at residues near the cytoplasm/membrane junction by a γ-secretase-like activity (16De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R.

Greenwald I. Nature. 1999; 398: 522-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Significantly, this γ-secretase activity appears necessary for Notch signaling and also appears to be regulated by PSs. Finally, because γ-secretase cleavage is the final step in the generation of Aβ, it remains a major therapeutic target for strategies designed to lower Aβ production. Thus, γ-secretase is not only an unusual proteolytic activity, but its activity has important biological consequences both with respect to the pathogenesis and treatment of AD and for cell biology in general. Many disparate roles have been hypothesized to account for the observed effects of PSs on γ-secretase cleavage. Recent studies of γ-secretase activity in cells derived from PS1 knockout mice have implicated PS1 in the regulation of intracellular trafficking (19Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X.Z. Ginty D.D. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1213-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), as cofactors for γ-secretase activity (13De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. Von Figura K. Van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar), or as γ-secretases themselves (14Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). The latter notion that PSs may be γ-secretase gained further support from studies demonstrating that mutation of either of two aspartate residues potentially lying in opposing transmembrane domains in both PS1 and PS2 decrease γ-secretase activity, presumably through a dominant negative mechanism (14Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 15Steiner H. Duff K. Capell A. Romig H. Grim M.G. Lincoln S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28669-28673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It was thus proposed that PSs may be novel intramembranous proteases with the aspartates functioning as the catalytic residues; alternatively, PSs may function as di-aspartyl cofactors for γ-secretase activity (14Wolfe M.S. Xia W.M. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, treatment of cultured cells with either pepstatin (11Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a prototypic aspartyl protease inhibitor, or a difluoroketone compound, which inhibits aspartyl proteases (20Wolfe M.S. Citron M. Diehl T.S. Xia W. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), reduces Aβ production to a similar extent as seen in PS1 knockout cell lines. However, in all of these cases Aβ production is not completely abolished, indicating that more than one protease likely contributes to γ-secretase-catalyzed cleavages, a notion suggested by numerous studies showing differential inhibition of the γ-40 and γ-42 activities (Refs. 11Murphy M.P.

Because γ-secretase is one of the major therapeutic targets in AD, it is essential to determine whether PSs are γ-secretases or whether they alter γ-secretase activity in some other fashion. It has been pointed out that one of the major problems with the “PSs-as-γ-secretases” hypothesis is the discrepancy between the predominantly ER localization of PSs and the subcellular sites of the majority of γ-secretase activity in the more distal secretory pathway (Golgi) and endosomal system (25Haass C. De Strooper B. Science. 1999; 286: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In this study, we illustrate another aspect of presenilin regulation of γ-secretase whereby PS1 appears to regulate multiple pharmacologically and spatially distinct γ-secretase activities as well as inducible α-secretase activity. The major implication of these observations is that PS1 either functions indirectly to regulate these activities (as in a trafficking or chaperone role), or, if PS1 is a γ-secretase, it must have multiple active sites or exist in a variety of catalytically active forms that are altered to an equivalent extent by the mutations we have studied. Boc-Gly-Val-Val-CHO was synthesized using standard peptide bond-forming reactions. Thus, the dipeptide Boc-Gly-Val-OBn (made by BOP/HOBt/DIEA/DMF-mediated coupling of Boc-Gly-OH with H-Val-OBn) was saponified and then coupled with the Weinreb valine amide (H-Val-(OMe)(Me), Aldrich) using BOP/HOBt/DIEA/DMF to yield the Weinreb tripeptide Boc-Gly-Val-Val-(OMe)(Me). The diisobutylaluminum hydride reduction of this product furnished, after silica gel purification, the inhibitor Boc-Gly-Val-Val-CHO in good overall yield. Each PS mutant was constructed by generating two polymerase chain reaction fragments from wild type (wt) PS1 cDNA template. The 5′-segment was produced using a forward primer to generate an HindIII site at the 5′-end of PS1 and a specific reverse primer from the actual site of mutation, which also created a class IIa restriction site (BsmBI). TheBsmBI site is removed by the restriction enzyme leaving the final sequence unaltered except for the specific desired mutation. A similar strategy was used to generate the 3′-end of the cDNA, terminating in a BamHI site. Following the appropriate restriction digests, the pieces were assembled by triple ligation in the pAG3hyg vector (11Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). All mutations were verified by sequencing (primer sequences are available on request). In this manner we generated four PS1 aspartate mutants (D257A or E, D385A or E; D → A/E), the PS ins254–6+ins386–8 (PS “out”) mutant, which contains amino acid insertions of SVY at position 256 and FIF at position 388 (duplicating the amino- and carboxyl-terminally adjacent 3 residues, respectively), and ΔTM1-2, which contains a deletion from amino acids 81–154 (inclusive). 70% confluent 6-well plates of either Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK), or human neuroglioma (H4) cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA preincubated with 3 μl of FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in serum-free OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) overnight. Media were then replaced with either Ham's F-12 (CHO cells), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (HEK cells), or OptiMEM (H4 cells) media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 800 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Calbiochem). After 10–14 days, selection was reduced to 200 μg/ml. Expression levels were monitored periodically by immunoblotting throughout the course of the experiment, and have been maintained for multiple passages. Transient transfections were performed in an identical manner, albeit without hygromycin selection. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Aβ was analyzed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry (IP/MS) as described previously (11Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-free media samples were collected following overnight conditioning, complete protease inhibitor cocktail added (PIC; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and total Aβ concentration was measured by 3160/4G8 sandwich ELISA. The amount of Aβ was standardized (to correct for transfection efficiency) to sAPP levels measured in the same sample using an Ab207 competitive ELISA with plates coated with 60 ng/well purified, recombinant sAPP (11Murphy M.P.

Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured by BAN50/BA27 and BAN50/BC05 ELISA, respectively. All measurements were performed in duplicate. For mass spectrometry, conditioned serum-free media from APP-transfected CHO cells was immunoprecipitated with 4G8/protein-A/G-plus-agarose beads and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis as described (26Wang R.

Cells were lysed in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100/TBS (pH 8.0) + PIC, and the insoluble material was separated by high speed centrifugation (20,000 × g). Lysates (10–15 μg of total protein, by bicinchoninic acid assay) were separated on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked overnight with 5% non-fat dried milk/TBS (pH 7.4)/0.05% Tween 20, and immunoblotted. PS1 was visualized with rabbit anti-PS1 loop and/or anti-PS1-N antibodies (each at 1:1000 dilution) (27Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F.

For APP, blots were probed with anti-CT20 antibody (1:500 dilution). Confluent 6-well plates of pooled stable HEK293 cells or HEKwt cells were labeled for 2 h with 200 μCi/well [35S]methionine/cysteine. For inducible α-secretase experiments, cells were treated with 1 μmphorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and serum-free conditioned media were collected after 6 h. Total sAPP was immunoprecipitated with Ab207/protein-G-agarose beads, separated on 10% Tris-Tricine gels, dried, and exposed to a low energy phosphor screen for 7 days. Data were analyzed using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuaNT™ software. For analysis of CTF, APP from Triton X-100-lysed cells was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-CT-20, separated on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels, and analyzed as above. Digitonin lysates were prepared, and equal amounts (1.5 mg) of protein from cells expressing ΔTM1-2 mutant and wild type PS1 were combined. The combined lysate was layered onto a 10–40% linear glycerol gradient, centrifuged, acetone-precipitated, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described (28Yu G. Chen F.

To further establish the existence of pharmacologically distinct γ-secretase cleavage sites, we examined the effects of a substrate-based (γ40-site) aldehyde inhibitor (Boc-glycine-valine-valinal; GVV) on Aβ production and APP CTF. When tested on transiently transfected 293T cells overexpressing APP695NL, GVV increased APP CTF in a dose-dependant fashion (data not shown) and selectively inhibited Aβ cleavage at sites other than 42, as measured both by ELISA (Fig. 1 A) and (IP/MS) (Fig. 1 B). The selective inhibition of cleavages other than Aβ42 by GVV is qualitatively similar to the effects on Aβ production observed with pepstatin (11Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4720-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar); however, GVV appears to be even more selective than those previously reported with doses that inhibit Aβ40 by >90% while not inhibiting Aβ42 production. Significantly, we have recently observed selective inhibition of Aβ40 production by GVV, pepstatin, and other peptide aldehyde inhibitors in an in vitro assay of γ-secretase activity, 2T. E. Golde, manuscript in preparation. indicating that the selectivity is not simply an issue of differential cell penetrance of the inhibitor. Thus, the elevations in Aβ42 production seen at low concentrations are best explained by an increased availability of APP CTF to a distinct γ-42 activity that is less sensitive to inhibition by GVV. Subsequent analysis of the effects of GVV treatment on γ-secretase cleavage in APP TMD mutants by ELISA (data not shown) and IP/MS (Fig.1 B) indicates that these mutants possess a variety of GVV-sensitive and -insensitive sites, further indicating that multiple proteolytic activities are involved in γ-secretase cleavage (11Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11914-11923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these data also revealed that those GVV-sensitive sites were closer to the luminal side of the APP TMD, whereas those GVV-insensitive sites were more distal. Thus, it appears that we can monitor at least two γ-secretase activities, a “γ-40 activity,” which cleaves residues more proximal to the luminal side and a γ-42 activity, which cleaves residues more distal to the luminal side. In addition to the aspartate mutants reported by Wolfe et al., we have identified two additional PS1 mutants that inhibit γ-secretase (Fig.2). The first mutant, PS1 ins254–6+ins386–8 (PS1 out), was generated to assess whether location of the aspartates relative to the membrane was an important functional element. In this mutant, the aspartates are not mutated, but their positions shifted by two 3-amino acid insertions within the transmembrane domain, potentially moving both Asp-257 and Asp-385 toward the cytoplasm and out of phase with the potential catalytic site. In the second mutant, ΔTM1-2, the first two transmembrane domains of PS1 are deleted, theoretically preserving the topology of the remaining protein. The inhibitory effect of this mutant on γ-secretase was identified during a screen for PS1 deletion mutants that altered Aβ production. We examined the effects of PS1 D→A/E, ΔTM1-2, and PS out mutants on the γ-secretase cleavages in three different cell lines: H4, HEK, and CHO. In each of these, we established pooled stable lines expressing wild type PS1 or the PS1 mutants, and then assessed APP processing and Aβ production after transient transfection with various APP expression constructs. To validate this system of transient transfection of APP into pooled stable PS1 lines, we performed extensive experiments on pooled stable lines expressing the FAD-linked PS1 mutants M139V and E280G. An example of this validation for H4 cells is shown in Fig. 3. In these experiments, both M139V and E280G are overexpressed (Fig. 3 A) and increase Aβ42 production without significantly altering total Aβ production (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 also shows the results obtained for PS1 mutants that inhibit γ-secretase activity in H4 cells. In lines expressing the ΔTM1-2 mutant, limited endoproteolysis of the smaller holoprotein (Fig. 3 A) is indicated by the presence of a truncated amino-terminal fragment migrating at ∼23 kDa. The use of pooled stable lines prevents us from precisely determining both the extent of cleavage and replacement of endogenous PS1. However, it is clear that overexpressed PS1 to some extent replaces endogenous PS1 (as indicated by decreased levels of endogenous PS1 NTF in the case of ΔTM1-2), and aspartate mutants are cleaved less efficiently (D257E shown). This was confirmed by blotting with a human-specific PS1 antibody (Chemicon; not shown). Significantly, following transient transfection with APP695NL, Aβ production (total, Aβ40 and Aβ42) is greatly curtailed in these cells (Fig. 3 B), and both the ΔTM1-2 and PS1 out mutants (not shown) were at least as effective at inhibiting Aβ production as were the aspartate mutations. To further investigate the effect of these PS1 mutants on γ-40 and γ-42 activities, pooled stable CHO and HEK cells overexpressing either PS1wt or one of the mutant constructs (Fig.4) were transiently transfected with either APP695NL or the APP TMD mutants I637P, T639K, ins625–628, or del625–628. PS1 expression, total Aβ, sAPP, and APP CTF were analyzed in these transfected cells. As in H4 cells, overexpression of these PS1 mutants resulted in varying degrees of replacement of endogenous PS1 and inefficient endoproteolysis of the PS1 holoprotein. APP CTF accumulated both at steady state (Fig.5 A) and during a 2-h chase period after metabolic labeling, whereas no effect was observed on constitutive sAPP secretion or turnover of APP holoproteins (data not shown). Aβ production from the APP695NL and APP TMD mutants was reduced dramatically when these constructs were expressed in CHO or HEK cells coexpressing these PS1 mutants (Fig. 5 B), and IP/MS analyses indicated that all γ-secretase cleavages were inhibited equally irrespective of inhibitor sensitivity (Fig. 5 C). These data indicate that these PS1 mutations regulate production of Aβ produced by both the pepstatin/GVV-sensitive and pepstatin/GVV-insensitive γ-secretases.Figure 5Effects of PS1 mutants on Aβ production. A, steady-state accumulation of APP CTF generated by β-secretase (C99) and α-secretase cleavage (C83) in PS1 aspartate mutants (blotted with CT-20). B, ELISA analysis of total Aβ. Pooled stable CHO and HEK lines stably expressing PS1wt, PS1 aspartate mutants, PS out, and ΔTM1-2 were transiently transfected with the indicated APP TMD mutant or APP695NL control, and the total Aβ and the sAPP were assayed by ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of secreted Aβ relative to the corresponding PS1wt control was markedly reduced in every case (averaged from three independent experiments; error bars indicate S.D.). C, IP/MS analysis of Aβ produced from APP TMD mutants in PS1 aspartate mutant cells. No differences were seen among the MS profiles from the different PS1 mutant lines. Schematic data from APP695NL and I637P are shown. The MS profile of Aβ peptides is essentially identical in both APP695NL and I637P for both PS1wt and PS1 mutant-expressing lines, indicating that the quantitative reduction of Aβ by the PS1 aspartate mutants alters both pepstatin/GVV-sensitive and pepstatin/GVV-insensitive γ-secretase cleavages equivalently.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One possible explanation for the inhibition of γ-secretase by these mutants is their ability to replace endogenous PS1 but not be incorporated into functional high molecular weight complexes. To explore this possibility, we examined digitonin lysates from PS1wt, ΔTM1-2, and D385A cell lines by glycerol density gradient centrifugation. To facilitate analysis, lysates from cells expressing the PS1 wild-type protein were used as an internal control and combined with an equal amount of lysate from the ΔTM1-2 cells. Analysis of these gradients revealed that the full-length ΔTM1-2 was incorporated into a"
https://openalex.org/W2060601535,"Tyrosine phosphorylation regulates multiple cell signaling pathways and functionally modulates a number of ion channels and receptors. Neurotransmitter transporters, which act to clear transmitter from the synaptic cleft, are regulated by multiple second messenger pathways that exert their effects, at least in part, by causing a redistribution of the transporter protein to or from the cell surface. To test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation affects transporter function and to determine its mechanism of action, we examined the regulation of the rat brain γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT1 expressed endogenously in hippocampal neurons and expressed heterologously in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases decreased GABA uptake; inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases increased GABA uptake. The decrease in uptake seen with tyrosine kinase inhibitors was correlated with a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of GAT1 and resulted in a redistribution of the transporter from the cell surface to intracellular locations. A mutant GAT1 construct that was refractory to tyrosine phosphorylation could not be regulated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Activators of protein kinase C, which are known to cause a redistribution of GAT1 from the cell surface, were additive to the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors suggesting that multiple signaling pathways control transporter redistribution. Application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which activates receptor tyrosine kinases, up-regulated GAT1 function suggesting one potential trigger for the cellular regulation of GAT1 signaling by tyrosine phosphorylation. These data support the hypothesis that transporter expression and function is controlled by the interplay of multiple cell signaling cascades."

Despite the source motion, the geometric and optical properties of the plume have remained constant. We propose that this can be explained by vaporization of a sulfur dioxide and/or sulfur “snowfield” over which a lava flow is moving. Eruption of a boundary-layer slurry through a rootless conduit with sonic conditions at the intake of the melted snow can account for the constancy of plume properties."

Regulation of VEGF in breast/endometrial cancer cell lines by steroid hormones has given variable results. One study showed that progestins, but not estrogens, androgens, or glucocorticoids, induced secretion of VEGF protein in T47D human breast cancer cells, whereas the progesterone-induced response was not observed in other breast (MCF-7, ZR-75, and MDA-MB-231) and endometrial (Ishikawa) cancer cell lines (32Hyder S.M. Murthy L. Stancel G.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 392-395PubMed Google Scholar). Another study reported that E2 and tamoxifen induced VEGF mRNA levels, and VEGF protein was also increased by the hormone in breast cancer cells (33Ruohola J.K. Valve E.M. Karkkainen M.J. Joukov V.

HEC1A endometrial cancer cells express ERα protein, and both E2 and tamoxifen induce cell proliferation and reporter gene activity in cells transfected with E2-responsive constructs containing promoter inserts from the complement C3, creatine kinase B, and cathepsin D genes (35Castro-Rivera E. Safe S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used HEC1A cells for investigating the molecular mechanisms of estrogen-dependent regulation of VEGF gene expression. The results showed that E2 decreased VEGF mRNA levels in HEC1A cells, and deletion analysis of the VEGF gene promoter identified a minimal sequence (−66 to −47) that was required for hormone-dependent decreased expression. Subsequent mutational analysis and results of gel mobility shift and DNA-footprinting assays indicated that hormonal effects were associated with ERα/Sp3 interactions at G/GC-rich sites. Transfection studies in Drosophila SL2 Schneider cells in culture also showed that ERα/Sp3 mediated decreased transactivation of a VEGF gene promoter-derived construct, and both ERα and Sp3 proteins physically interact, as determined in coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. Thus, ligand-activated ERα/Sp3 interaction with G/GC-rich elements represents a novel pathway for down-regulation of VEGF, and these interactions may be important for hormone-dependent regulation of other genes given the appropriate cellular context.DISCUSSIONVEGF plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth as well as the growth and metastasis of various primary tumors (1Ausprunk D.H.

Recent studies in this laboratory have demonstrated that the HEC1A endometrial carcinoma cell line expresses ERα and is E2-responsive (35Castro-Rivera E. Safe S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, analysis of VEGF mRNA levels and activities of constructs containing VEGF gene promoter inserts (Fig. 1) show that E2 down-regulates VEGF. This hormone-mediated response is dependent on ERα and can be reversed by the pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 (but not tamoxifen; data not shown); however, in cells cotransfected with pVEGF4 or pVEGF5 and PR expression plasmid, treatment with progesterone did not alter reporter gene activity. Thus down-regulation of VEGF by E2 parallels results of previous studies showing that p53 and von Hippel-Lindau factor also decreased VEGF activity and/or VEGF gene promoter-dependent constructs (85Mukhopadhyay D.

Analysis of the VEGF gene promoter has shown that high basal activity of constructs is dependent on a GC/G-rich sequence from −88 to −50 that contains putative binding sites for Sp1-like proteins, Egr-1 and AP-2 (36Finkenzeller G. Sparacio A. Technau A. Marme D. Siemeister G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 37Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol.

Interestingly transforming growth factor-α and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase activate VEGF gene promoter constructs at GC-rich regions between −88 to −66 that bind AP-2 and Sp1 proteins, and both transcription factors play a role in this response in hamster CCL39 fibroblast and A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells (37Milanini J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 750-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the AP-2 site did not affect platelet-derived growth factor-induced responses that appeared to be dependent on Sp1 and/or Sp3 interactions with three GC-rich sites between −85 to −50 (36Finkenzeller G. Sparacio A. Technau A. Marme D. Siemeister G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Results of deletion analysis of the VEGF gene promoter in HEC1A cells showed (Figs. 1 B and2 D) that comparable ERα-mediated down-regulation was observed for both pVEGF6 and pVEGF8, but not pVEGF7, suggesting that the −66 to −52 region of the promoter was required for the hormone-dependent inhibitory response.This region of the promoter contains two GC-rich binding sites for Sp-like proteins and an overlapping Egr-1 site at −60 to −51. Results of gel mobility shift assays indicated that ERα did not bind directly to this region of the promoter and nuclear extracts formed retarded bands that primarily contained Sp1 and Sp3 proteins. Egr-1 competition with Sp1 binding to GC-rich sites can result in repressed gene expression (48Thottassery J.V. Sun D. Zambetti G.P. Troutman A. Sukhatme V.P. Schuetz E.G. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol.

Novosad D.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 189: 119-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our studies show the in vitro expressed Egr-1 did not bind the −66 to −47 oligonucleotide, suggesting that Sp1 and/or Sp3 are the major proteins directly interacting with this region of the gene promoter.Previous studies in this laboratory show that ERα interacts with Sp1 protein (65Porter W. Saville B. Hoivik D. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and ligand-activated ERα/Sp1 interactions with GC-rich sites are associated with induction of several E2-responsive genes in breast cancer cells (53Wang F.

Sp1 or Sp3 alone or in combination with ERα footprinted G/GC-rich sites in the proximal region of the VEGF gene promoter (Figs. 7), and the pattern of Sp3-DNA interactions has previously been observed for ERα-Sp1 binding to other GC-rich gene promoters (53Wang F.

Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays (Figs. 6, B–D) demonstrate that like Sp1 (65Porter W. Saville B. Hoivik D. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), Sp3 also physically interacts with ERα; however, there are some differences in their interacting domains since ERα preferentially binds to the C-terminal (ZD) domain of Sp1 protein (65Porter W. Saville B. Hoivik D. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), whereas ERα interacts with multiple (ZD, BC, and B) domains of Sp3. In contrast, GST-Sp3 fusion protein preferentially interacted with the AF1-DBD (HE15) of ERα, whereas GST-Sp1 interacted with ER variant proteins expressing AF1 (HE15) or AF2 (HE19) alone (data not shown). Although Sp1 and Sp3 proteins alone activated pVEGF6 in SL-2 cells (Fig. 5) as described previously for other GC-rich promoters in these cells (90Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 91Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol.

This novel ERα/Sp3 pathway was further confirmed in HEC1A cells using a dominant negative form of Sp3 that partially reversed ERα/Sp3 down-regulation of pVEGF6 (Fig.5 C). Since treatment-dependent variations in Sp3/Sp1 levels can affect promoter activity (51Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Wu X. Peterson C.A. Webster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26087-26093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we also investigated immunoreactive Sp1 and Sp3 protein levels after treatment with E2 (Fig.4 C). Sp1 protein was not affected, whereas a small but significant increase (<30%) in Sp3 levels was observed, and this may also contribute to the overall decreased transcriptional activation of VEGF by E2 in HEC1A cells.Sp1 physically and functionally interacts with several nuclear receptor superfamily proteins including ERα (53Wang F.

Representative members of this family of compounds (cholesterol, quinones, carotenoids, polyprenyl phosphates, and rubber) display diversity in structure as well as function. Polyprenol phosphate (Pol-P)1 is intimately involved in prokaryotic cell wall biosynthesis. In fact, evidence suggests that the rate of bacterial cell wall synthesis in vivo could be regulated by Pol-P levels (2Anderson R.G. Hussey H. Baddiley J. Biochem.

Eubacteria usually contain a single Pol-P molecule (C55) composed of 11 isoprene units: ω,E,E,polyZ-undecaprenyl-P. 2The stereochemical configuration of the isoprene units are listed starting at the ω-end of the molecule. Mycobacteria are exceptions to this rule. Takayama et al. demonstrated that M. smegmatis possesses two unique Pol-P: 1) a heptaprenyl phosphate (C35) with four saturated, twoE, and one Z double bond and 2) a decaprenyl phosphate (C50) with one E and eightZ double bonds (6Takayama K.

M. tuberculosisappears to be more typical of other eubacteria than M. smegmatis, since it appears to contain a single Pol-P molecule, decaprenyl phosphate, whose stereochemistry has not yet been determined (9Takayama K.

We have implicated Pol-P-Man in the biosynthesis of mycobacterial lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan; Pol-P-Man is the direct donor of mannose to the phosphatidyl-myo-inositol oligomannosides to give rise to phosphatidyl-myo-inositol oligomannoside-containing lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan (10Besra G.S.

In addition, heptaprenyl phosphate is found in the form of mycolyl-6-α-d-mannosyl-1-phosphorylheptaprenol and may function to carry mature mycolic acids across the plasma membrane (11Besra G.S. Sievert T. Lee R.E. Slayden R.A. Brennan P.J. Takayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12735-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Arabinosyl-1-phosphoryldecaprenol is donor of the arabinofuranosyl residue in the arabinan of arabinogalactan, arabinomannan, and lipoarabinomannan (12Wolucka B.A. McNeil M.R. de Hoffmann E. Chojnacki T. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23328-23335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disaccharide linker unit that bridges the arabinogalactan to the peptidoglycan is also formed while attached to Pol-P, which acts as the template for the synthesis of the entire mycolylarabinogalactan-linker unit complex (8Mikusova K. Mikus M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Pol-P (probably the decaprenyl phosphate) also has a role in mycobacterial peptidoglycan synthesis (5van Heijenoort J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar, 13van Heijenoort J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Despite its obvious importance, the genetics and biochemistry of Pol-P synthesis have not been investigated in mycobacteria. All known isoprenoids share a common biosynthetic mechanism beginning with the condensation of two five carbon precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate, to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C10) (14IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical NomenclatureaEur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This and subsequent additions of IPP to the growing allylic diphosphate (to form farnesyl diphosphate (FPP, C15) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP, C20), etc.) are catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. The sequential addition of IPP to allylic diphosphate precursors continues until a physiologically relevant chain length is reached. At this point, the molecule can be dephosphorylated to form Pol-P. Only a small fraction of the enzymes involved in isoprenoid chain elongation have been studied, and genetic information is available for only a subset of these (1Sacchettini J.C. Poulter C.D. Science. 1997; 277: 1788-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Amino acid alignments of these enzymes generated by Chen et al. in 1994 (15Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and again by Kellogg and Poulter in 1997 (16Kellogg B.A. Poulter C.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) have defined five conserved regions, including two aspartic acid-rich (DD(XX)2D motifs. However, the resulting consensus sequences have to date been useful in identifying only those enzymes catalyzing the formation of Edouble bonds. Enzymes responsible for catalyzing the formation of Z double bonds are believed to be of a different family. Recently, a publication described the molecular cloning, expression, and purification of undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, an enzyme fromMicrococcus luteus that catalyzes Z-polyprenyl chain elongation of the allylic substrate ω,E,E-FPP (17Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the first such enzyme to have its amino acid sequence determined. As anticipated, it had no homology to any of the E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. Apfelet al. (18Apfel C.M. Takacs B. Fountoulakis M. Stieger M. Keck W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) published an alignment of 28 putative undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase homologs and demonstrated long chain prenyltransferase activity for three of them (Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae). Also, the Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase (dolichol synthase) from Saccharomyces cervisiae has been identified (19Kato J. Fujisaki S. Nakajima K. Nishimura Y. Sato M. Nakano A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2733-2738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Sato M. Sato K. Nishikawa S. Hirata A. Kato J. Nakano A. Mol. Cell.

The determination of the complete genome sequence for Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv has allowed for systematic exploration of gene function in this organism (21Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S.

We have identified two open reading frames in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome, Rv1086 and Rv2361c, whose predicted protein products have homology to the undecaprenyl diphosphate proteins identified by Shimizu et al. and Apfel et al. and homology to the yeast dolichol synthase (17Shimizu N.

The open reading frames of the putative M. tuberculosis Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases were cloned and overexpressed in an attempt to map the pathway for the synthesis of Pol-P. [14C]Isopentenyl diphosphate ([14C]IPP, 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Potato acid phosphatase (grade 2) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Kanamycin, farnesol (mixed stereoisomers), ω,E,E-farnesol, ω,E-geraniol, ω,E,E,E-geranylgeraniol were purchased from Sigma. ω,E,E-Farnesyl diphosphate and ω,E-geranyl diphosphate were synthesized as described by Davisson et al. (22Davisson V.J. Woodside A.B. Poulter C.D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 110: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Authentic prenols of various chain lengths were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (Warsaw, Poland). Kieselgel 60 F254 TLC plates were from EM Science, and Baker Si-Reverse Phase C18 TLC plates were from J. T. Baker Inc. Restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII, LB agar and LB broth, DNTPs, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit was purchased from Qiagen Inc.Escherichia coli competent cells (XL-1 Blue) were purchased from Stratagene. Vent Polymerase was purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Wild type and recombinant (containing pVV16 empty vector or pVV16 with insert Rv1086 or Rv2361c)M. smegmatis strains were grown to mid-log phase in LB broth (20 μg/ml kanamycin for recombinant strains). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with a 0.9% saline solution, and centrifuged again. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.9), 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were disrupted by probe sonication on ice with a Sanyo Soniprep 150 (10 cycles of 60 s on and 90 s off). The resulting suspension was then centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h in a Beckman 70.1 TI ultracentrifuge rotor. The supernatant (cytosol) was divided into aliquots and frozen at −70 °C until used. The pellet (membranes) was resuspended in homogenization buffer, divided into aliquots, and frozen at −70 °C until used. The protein concentrations of the fractions were estimated using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Isoprenyl diphosphate synthase activity was assayed in mixtures containing 50 mmMOPS (pH 7.9), 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% Triton X-100, 100 μm allylic diphosphate, 30 μm[14C]IPP, and 75 μg of protein in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubating at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of water saturated with NaCl. Radiolabeled products were extracted with butanol saturated with water, and an aliquot was taken for liquid scintillation spectrometry. Reactions were assayed under conditions where they were linear for both time and protein concentration. The radiolabeled products were characterized by TLC after treatment with potato acid phosphatase. Samples to be dephosphorylated by potato acid phosphatase (in order to determine the length of the prenyl chain and the stereochemistry of the isoprene units) were dried under a stream of nitrogen. The samples were dissolved in 5 ml of buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 60% methanol. After a brief bath sonication, 20 units of potato acid phosphatase were added, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C overnight. Dephosphorylated products were extracted 3 times with 1 ml of n-hexane. The pooled extracts were washed with 1 ml of water, and the extracts were evaporated under nitrogen. The samples were dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and an aliquot was taken for liquid scintillation spectrometry. A second aliquot was spotted on TLC plates for analysis. Analysis of the chain length of the dephosphorylated products was accomplished by spotting the radioactive compounds on reverse phase C18 TLC plates. The plates were then developed in methanol/acetone (8:2, v/v). Radioactive spots were located with a Bioscan System 200 Imaging Scanner (Bioscan Inc.) and by autoradiography. Standard polyprenols were located with an anisaldehyde spray reagent (23Dunphy P.J. Kerr J.D. Pennock J.F. Whittle K.J. Feeney J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 136: 136-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The radioactive spots derived from enzymatically labeled, dephosphorylated products that were identified as farnesol were scraped from the TLC plates and extracted from the gel with two 5-ml portions of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The extracts were pooled and dried under nitrogen. The radiolabeled compounds were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) containing authentic, nonradioactive ω,E,E-farnesol or mixed stereoisomers (ω,E,E and ω,E,Z) of farnesol; the stereochemistry of the radiolabeled products were determined by spotting on silica gel 60 TLC plates, which were developed with toluene/ethyl acetate (7:3, v/v). Radioactive spots were located with the Bioscan System 200 Imaging Scanner and by autoradiography. Standard polyprenols were located with an anisaldehyde spray reagent (23Dunphy P.J. Kerr J.D.

Open reading frames Rv1086 and Rv2361c in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome (21Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E.

Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Advanced BLAST searches were performed online at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. 3The National Center for Biotechnology Information can be found on the World Wide Web. Alignments were created using Multalin 4Multalin alignments can be generated on the World Wide Web. and Genedoc. 5Genedoc is freely distributed on the World Wide Web. The following primers were designed to amplify open reading frame Rv1086 from H37Rv genomic DNA: 5′-GGTACATATGGAGATCATCCCGCCG-3′ and 5′-CGTCCTGCGAAGCTTTCACCTGCCG-3′. Primers were also designed to amplify open reading frame Rv2361c from H37Rv genomic DNA: (5′-ATATCATATGGCTAGGGATGCACGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGTAGGAAGCTTCTAGGCGCTC-3′). NdeI and HindIII restriction endonuclease sites (nucleotides underlined in above primer sequences) were engineered into the N-terminal and C-terminal primers, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp 2400 PCR System using Vent DNA Polymerase. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into the mycobacterial expression vector pVV16 (a gift from Dr. Varalakshmi Vissa, Colorado State University), which had been previously digested with the same enzymes. The ligation mixture was electroporated intoE. coli competent cells (XL-1 Blue). Cells containing plasmid were selected on LB agar containing kanamycin at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. Purified plasmids were subjected to restriction and sequence analysis. The resulting constructs, named pVV-Rv1086 and pVV-Rv2361c, were electroporated into M. smegmatis mc2155. In addition, pVV16 (without insert) was electroporated into M. smegmatis for use as a control. For electroporation, M. smegmatis cells were grown to late log phase in LB broth; washed seven times with ice-cold, sterile 10% glycerol; and frozen at −70 °C in 50-μl aliquots until used. Electroporation was performed at 2.5 V, 800 ohms, 25 microfarads. Cells were recovered in LB broth for 90 min and plated on LB agar with kanamycin (20 μg/ml). A single colony was chosen to start liquid cultures in LB broth with kanamycin (20 μg/ml). Rv1086 and Rv2361c were cloned into pVV16. In this mycobacterial specific expression vector, the cloned genes are constitutively expressed under the control of the heat shock promoter HSP60. Protein (membrane or cytosol) from wild type, empty vector or recombinant strains was assayed for [14C]IPP incorporation into butanol-extractable material in the presence of ω,E-GPP or ω,E,E-FPP as the reaction primer. The presence of pVV16 (empty vector) in bacteria and the required kanamycin in the growth medium had no effect on the expression of isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (data not shown). Both Rv1086 and Rv2361c cytosolic assays primed with ω,E-GPP showed an increase of [14C]IPP incorporation into butanol-extractable material when compared with the wild type cytosolic assays (TableI). However, only the Rv2361c cytosolic assay primed with ω,E,E-FPP showed an increase in [14C]IPP incorporation. Assays of membrane protein revealed similar results (Table I). The Rv2361c recombinant membrane protein was able to utilize both primers more effectively than wild type membrane protein. The Rv1086 recombinant membrane protein was able to utilize more [14C]IPP than wild type membrane protein when primed with ω,E-GPP but not when primed with ω,E,E-FPP. Protein fractions derived from the strains expressing Rv1086 or Rv2361c had increased isoprenyl diphosphate synthase activity when compared with the corresponding wild type protein fractions.Table IIncorporation of [14C]IPP into allylic diphosphates catalyzed by cytosolic or membrane fractions prepared from wild type M. smegmatis, or recombinant M. smegmatisAllylic substrateCytosolic activityMembrane activityWTRv1086Rv2361cWTRv1086Rv2361cpmol/mg/minpmol/mg/minω,E-GPP2989266144329661108ω,E,E-FPP245145476260258487Cytosol and membrane fractions from wild type M. smegmatisor recombinant M. smegmatis expressing Rv1086 or Rv2361c were assayed for [14C]IPP incorporation into allylic diphosphates.

The products were extracted with n-butanol saturated with water and subjected to scintillation spectrometry. WT, wild type. The products of the above assays were subjected to enzymatic dephosphorylation for analysis of chain length by TLC. Butanol-extracted reaction products were dephosphorylated, and equal amounts of radioactivity were loaded onto reverse-phase TLC plates. Figs. 1and 2 show the migration of [14C]IPP-labeled products from the cytosol and membrane reactions, respectively. Wild type cytosol primed with ω,E-GPP (Fig. 1 A) primarily produces geranylgeranyl diphosphate (specific activity = 173 pmol/mg/min). The smaller amounts of FPP (specific activity = 69 pmol/mg/min) and heptaprenyl diphosphate (specific activity = 27 pmol/mg/min) may be due to imperfect fractionation of membrane and cytosolic proteins as these products are seen at approximately 2–3-fold higher concentration in the membrane assays (compare Figs. 1 A and2 A). Wild type cytosol when primed with ω,E,E-FPP (Fig. 1 B), once again primarily produced geranylgeranyl diphosphate (specific activity = 169 pmol/mg/min). Rv2361c cytosolic assays primed with ω,E-GPP and ω,E,E-FPP (Fig. 2,C and D) showed an increase in the synthesis of decaprenyl diphosphate (specific activity = 141 and 126 pmol/mg/min, respectively), an activity that was almost undetectable in wild type cytosol. Products corresponding to the calculated migrations of octaprenol and nonaprenol are also present. Rv1086 cytosolic assays primed with ω,E-GPP (Fig. 1 E) showed a 10-fold increase of [14C]IPP incorporation into FPP (specific activity = 714 pmol/mg/min) versus wild type (specific activity = 69 pmol/mg/min), whereas Rv1086 cytosolic assays primed with ω,E,E-FPP (Fig. 1 F) showed 3-fold decrease in FPP synthesis (but had approximately equal heptaprenyl diphosphate synthesis) when compared with the wild type.Figure 2TLC analysis of [14C] IPP radiolabeled products synthesized by membrane fractions from wild type or recombinant M. smegmatis. Wild type (WT) or recombinant (expressing Rv2361c or Rv1086) M. smegmatismembrane was assayed in the presence of either ω,E-GPP (A, C, E) or ω,E,E-FPP (B, D, F). Assay conditions and identification of products were as described in the legend to Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the products from the wild type membrane assays primed with ω,E-GPP (Fig. 2 A) are compared with the recombinant membrane assays primed with ω,E-GPP (Fig. 2,C and E), there is a significant increase in [14C]IPP incorporation into decaprenyl diphosphate caused by the expression of Rv2361c (specific activity = 443 pmol/mg/min) and into FPP caused by the expression of Rv1086 (specific activity = 701 pmol/mg/min). In the membrane assays primed with ω,E,E-FPP (Fig. 2, B, D, and F), there is a 10-fold increase of [14C]IPP incorporation into decaprenyl diphosphate by the Rv2361c recombinant (specific activity = 205 pmol/mg/min) compared with the corresponding wild type assay. As expected from the results in Table I, the Rv1086 membrane assay primed with ω,E,E-FPP did not reveal any increased incorporation when compared with the corresponding wild type assay. The farnesyl diphosphate created by adding one molecule of [14C]IPP to ω,E-GPP can have two possible stereochemistries, ω,E,E-FPP or ω,E,Z-FPP. It is possible to separate these stereoisomers by silica gel TLC (Fig. 3,lane 2). The farnesol produced from enzymatically dephosphorylating the products of the Rv1086 membrane assay primed with ω,E-GPP (Fig. 2 E) was recovered from reverse-phase TLC plate and loaded onto silica gel 60 TLC plates. The recovered farnesol migrated along with cold standard ω,E,Z-farnesol, which runs ahead of cold standard ω,E,E-farnesol (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). The farnesol produced from enzymatically dephosphorylating the products of the Rv1086 cytosolic assay primed with ω,E-GPP was also in the ω,E,Z-configuration (data not shown). The M. tuberculosis open reading frame Rv1086 encodes an ω,E,Z-farnesyl diphosphate synthase (Z-FPPS). This is the first report of an amino acid sequence for a short chain Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase. Previously, the family of Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases contained only undecaprenyl diphosphate synthases, dolichol synthases, and rubber synthase. Based on the relative lengthy nature of their products (C55 or greater) and the commonZ-stereochemistry catalyzed, members of the Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase family became synonymous with “long chain” isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. It is now clear that short chain Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases exist. However, with the amount of amino acid sequence information available at this time, short chain Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases remain indistinguishable from the long chain Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases in genomic data bases. The fact that the clonedZ-FPPS activity was equally distributed between the cytosolic and the membrane fractions confirms our earlier observations that M. tuberculosis cytosolic and membrane fractions contain nearly equal amounts of Z-FPPS activity, whereas the Z-FPPS activity of M. smegmatis was preferentially localized to the membrane fraction. 6D. Crick, submitted for publication. The M. tuberculosis open reading frame Rv2361c encodes a decaprenyl diphosphate (DecaPP) synthase. If the M. tuberculosis DecaPP synthase produces a product stereochemically identical to the DecaPP synthase from M. smegmatis, then its presumed allylic diphosphate substrate in vivo would be ω,E,Z-FPP, and each molecule of IPP would be added with Z-stereoconfiguration to yield ω,E,polyZ-decaprenyl phosphate (6Takayama K. Schnoes H. Semmler E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 316: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our assays showed that Rv2361c was able to use the allylic primers ω,E-GPP and ω,E,E-FPP. ω,E-GPP may not be used directly for DecaPP synthesis but instead may be used for ω,E,Z-FPP synthesis by the background wild type M. smegmatis enzymes. ω,E,Z-FPP is then used for DecaPP synthesis. This would explain the decrease in the amount of FPP seen in the Rv2361c membrane assay (Fig. 2 C) when compared with the wild type membrane assay (Fig. 2 A). On the other hand, ω,E,E-FPP was also a functional substrate for DecaPP synthesis. Precedence for this lack of absolute substrate specificity has been demonstrated in vitro with other isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (24Takahashi I. Ogura K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1527-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Crick D.C. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1354-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Ericsson J. Thelin A. Chojnacki T. Dallner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19730-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of each isoprene addition by DecaPP synthase has not been established. However, based on amino acid sequence homology between Rv2361c and the knownZ-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, it is fair to assume that each isoprene addition would be in the Z-stereoconfiguration. The first Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase to have its amino acid sequence reported, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (17Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), had no homology to the E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (15Chen A. Kroon P.A. Poulter C.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 600-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Kellogg B.A. Poulter C.D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It did however contain an aspartate rich DD(XX)2D motif reminiscent of the E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. Shimizu et al. (17Shimizu N. Koyama T. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19476-19481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggested that this motif may represent the diphosphate binding site. The signature motif (Fig.4, amino acids 168–172 in MICLU) is not conserved among the M. tuberculosis Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases described here or any of the other knownZ-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. Therefore, its occurrence in M. luteus undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase is probably coincidental and not related to enzymatic activity. We have generated an alignment of M. tuberculosis open reading frames Rv2361c, Rv1086 along with all of the biochemically assayed Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases known at this time (undecaprenyl diphosphate synthases from M. luteus, E. coli, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae and dolichol synthase from S. cervisiae (Fig. 4)). This alignment demonstrates that there are several regions of amino acid sequence conservation among the Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases. The amino acid sequence conservation can be roughly distributed into four regions, which we have designated A–D (to avoid confusion with the five conserved regions (I–V) in E-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases). Region B contains a high degree of residues with charged and uncharged polar side chains, which could hypothetically aid in binding of the diphosphate moiety in the active site. Region B also contains conserved amino acids with large aromatic side chains such as tryptophan and phenylalanine (Fig. 4, amino acid positions 121 and 126). However, the Rv1086 (Z-FPPS) sequence contains leucine at both of these positions (the relevance of this particular observation is unknown). The amino acid sequences of Rv1086 and Rv2361c were also analyzed for secondary structure using various computer programs (TMpred, 7Tmpred can be found on the World Wide Web. TMAP, 8TMAP can be found on the World Wide Web. TopPred2, 9TopPred2 can be found on the World Wide Web. and SOSUI 10SOSUI can be found on the World Wide Web. ). None of the programs reported a membrane-spanning region in Rv1086; however, TMpred and TMAP both predicted a single membrane-spanning region (amino acids 92–120) in Rv2361c. The preferred model from the TMpred report suggested that the amino terminus of the protein exists outside the membrane, amino acids 92–120 span the membrane, and the remaining carboxyl terminus of the protein is on the interior of the membrane. This model is consistent with our observations in that DecaPP synthase activity is found in the membrane fraction of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and the subcellular location of Rv1086 is more ambiguous as activity can be found in both the cytosolic and membrane fractions.6 Until more information about the active sites and crystal structures of Z-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases is gathered, it will not be possible to predict the chain length of the products of these enzymes based on amino acid sequence alone. Recently, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction studies have been reported for the M. luteus undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (27Fujihashi M. Shimizu N. Zhang Y.W. Koyama T. Miki K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1606-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It would be of great interest to determine the quaternary structures of the mycobacterial enzymes, since they could reveal structural requirements for chain length determination. We have initiated purification of these enzymes."

Observed ultrahigh pressure mineral chemistries include majorite, calcium- and magnesium-perovskite, aluminous silicate phases, and microdiamond. Based on an empirical barometer, majoritic garnets in these xenoliths record pressures of up to 22 gigapascal. The occurrence of material with perovskite chemistry and several enigmatic aluminous phases indicates pressures of up to 27 gigapascal.

Yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library identified radixin, a member of the ERM family of three closely related proteins (ezrin, radixin, and moesin), as a protein that interacted with Gα13. Interaction between radixin and Gα13was confirmed by in vitro binding assay and by co-immunoprecipitation technique. Activated Gα13 induced conformational activation of radixin, as determined by binding of radixin to polymerized F-actin and by immunofluorescence in intact cells. Finally, two dominant negative mutants of radixin inhibited Gα13-induced focus formation of Rat-1 fibroblasts but did not affect Ras-induced focus formation. Our results identifying a new signaling pathway for Gα13 indicate that ERM proteins can be activated by and serve as effectors of heterotrimeric G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2100617260,"The nuclear gene OXA1 encodes a protein located within the mitochondrial inner membrane that is required for the biogenesis of both cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) and ATPase. In the absence of Oxa1p, the translocation of the mitochondrially encoded subunit Cox2p to the intermembrane space (also referred to as export) is prevented, and it has been proposed that Oxa1p could be a component of a general mitochondrial export machinery. We have examined the role of Oxa1p in light of its relationships with two mitochondrial proteases, the matrix protease Afg3p-Rca1p and the intermembrane space protease Yme1p, by analyzing the assembly and activity of the Cox and ATPase complexes in Δoxa1,Δoxa1Δafg3, and Δoxa1Δyme1 mutants. We show that membrane subunits of both complexes are specifically degraded in the absence of Oxa1p. Neither Afg3p nor Yme1p is responsible for the degradation of Cox subunits. However, the F0 subunits Atp4p, Atp6p, and Atp17p are stabilized in the Δoxa1Δyme1 double mutant, and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity is restored, showing that the increased stability of the ATPase subunits allows significant translocation and assembly to occur even in the absence of Oxa1p. These results suggest that Oxa1p is not essential for the export of ATPase subunits.

The mitochondrial genome encodes only a few subunits of the respiratory complexes, whereas the other subunits and a number of proteins, which are not intrinsic components of the complexes but are required for their biogenesis, are nuclearly encoded.The Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear gene OXA1encodes such an assembly-assisting factor that is required for the biogenesis of both cytochrome c oxidase (Cox)1 and ATPase (4Bonnefoy N.

In the absence of Oxa1p, oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity is significantly decreased, and Cox activity is totally abolished. On non-denaturing gels, the Cox complex of Δoxa1 strains displays a higher mobility probably due to the lack of accumulation of the mitochondrially encoded subunits (9Meyer W. Bömer U. Pratje E.

In addition to their proteolytic activity, these proteases seem to display a chaperone-like activity (25Paul M.-F. Tzagoloff A.

The human, Arabidopsis, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe OXA1 genes have been identified using functional complementation of a yeast oxa1 mutation (30Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groudinsky O. Minet M.

Human cDNAs encoding proteins highly related to Afg3p-Rca1p have also been described, and one of them encodes paraplegin, which, when mutated, is responsible for a hereditary spastic paraplegia (33Casari G.

Genomics. 1999; 59: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).In this work, we have studied the relationships between Oxa1p and the two inner membrane AAA (ATPasesassociated with diverse cellular activities) proteases by analyzing the assembly and activity of the Cox and ATPase complexes in Δoxa1,Δoxa1Δafg3, and Δoxa1Δyme1 mutants. We show that membrane subunits of both complexes, whether mitochondrially or nuclearly encoded, are rapidly degraded in the absence of Oxa1p. Interestingly, neither Afg3p nor Yme1p is responsible for the degradation of Cox subunits, whereas F0-ATPase subunits are stabilized in the absence of Yme1p. The increased stability of the ATPase subunits in the Δoxa1Δyme1double mutant allows significant assembly to occur since oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity is restored. Altogether, our results suggest that Oxa1p is not essential for the export of ATPase subunits. In addition, although respiratory function is dispensable in S. cerevisiae, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of the AFG3 and YME1 genes is lethal.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that Oxa1p is specifically required for the stability of the membrane subunits of the Cox and ATPase complexes. Such specificity is consistent with the inner membrane location of Oxa1p and with a role in export and/or assembly of the membrane subunits of these two complexes. We then tested whether the unexported and/or unassembled membrane subunits could be the target of the known inner membrane protease complexes Yme1p and Afg3p-Rca1p.Concerning the Cox subunits, Cox2p is a known substrate of Yme1p (20Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,23Nakai T. Yasuhara T. Fujiki Y. Ohashi A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1996; 7: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the complex Afg3p-Rca1p has been shown to participate in the degradation of Cox1p and Cox3p (21Guélin E. Rep M. Grivell L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Artl H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Since pre-Cox2p export is blocked in the Δoxa1 mutant (11Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Yme1p is active in the intermembrane space, it is not surprising that Yme1p does not degrade pre-Cox2p in the Δoxa1 mutant. However, the fact that the inactivation of neither YME1 nor AFG3 could restore pre-Cox2p or the other Cox subunit stability suggests that either another protease is responsible for the degradation of these subunits or that they can be degraded by Yme1p and Afg3p-Rca1p. We rather favor the first hypothesis since the Cox subunits are still unstable when both Yme1p and Afg3p protease activities are blocked.It has been shown that the assembly of Cox1p, Cox2p, Cox3p, and Cox4p is interdependent (43Lemaire C. Robineau S. Netter P. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For example, in a cox2 mutant, the accumulation of the three other subunits is reduced. A specific pre-Cox2p export defect could then explain the general instability of most of the other Cox subunits found in Δoxa1strains. However, the fact that the suppressor mutations that compensate for the absence of Oxa1p fully compensate for the maturation defect of Cox2p but only partially restore Cox activity (10Hamel P. Lemaire C. Bonnefoy N. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Dujardin G. Genetics. 1998; 150: 601-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Oxa1p is not required only for Cox2p export. Whether the primary function of Oxa1p in Cox biogenesis is linked to export of membrane subunits and/or their assembly still remains an open question, both processes being tightly linked.As far as the ATPase is concerned, we found that the F0membrane subunits are stabilized in the absence of Yme1p. Cross-linking experiments have shown that the subunits Atp4p, Atp6p, and Atp17p display accessible targets in the intermembrane space (41Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Chaignepain S. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to determine whether they all represent true targets of Yme1p or whether only one subunit is degraded by this protease and exerts a protective effect upon the others. Nevertheless, the restoration of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in the Δoxa1Δyme1 double mutant shows that the increased stability of the ATPase membrane subunits allows significant translocation and assembly to occur. This result suggests that Oxa1p is not essential for the export of the ATPase subunits.It has been proposed that the assembly of the three mitochondrially encoded subunits of the F0 sector (Atp6p, Atp8p, and Atp9p) occurs first and is required for the subsequent assembly of Atp4p and then Atp5p (44Hadikusumo R.G. Meltzer S. Choo W.M. Jean-François M.J.B. Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 45Straffon A.F.L. Prescott M. Nagley P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25690-25696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Atp6p and Atp4p levels are dramatically reduced in the Δoxa1 strain, whereas Atp9p and Atp5p levels are not. For Atp9p, our results can be related to the data showing that Atp9p is associated with the F1 sector independently of the other F0subunits (44Hadikusumo R.G. Meltzer S. Choo W.M. Jean-François M.J.B. Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For Atp5p, our data suggest that its accumulation is independent of the formation of the F0 complex. In accordance with these results, we found that Atp5p was also stable in rho0 cells (data not shown), which are devoid of mitochondrial DNA and therefore of mitochondrially encoded subunits of F0.Finally, we have shown that the simultaneous absence of Afg3p (or Rca1p) and Yme1p is lethal and that viability is restored by the introduction of the proteolytically inactive variant of Afg3p. This suggests that Afg3p-Rca1p and Yme1p have an overlapping essential function that is probably due to the chaperone-like function. Alternatively, the cell viability might require both protease and chaperone activities to be functional. Although Oxa1p partially compensates for the AFG3 inactivation and could also display a “chaperone-like” function, the lethality of the double inactivation of AFG3 and YME1 cannot be cured by overexpressing the OXA1 gene (data not shown). It has been shown that the growth of Δyme1 rho − cells is severely affected (47Weber R.E. Rooks R.S. Shafer K.S. Chase J.W. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 1995; 140: 435-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the lethality of the double mutant Δafg3Δyme1 is probably not simply due to the accumulation of rho − mutants since the percentage of rho − mutants is ∼15% in the Δafg3 mutant. In S. cerevisiae, respiratory function is dispensable, but the integrity of the mitochondrial compartment is essential. Thus, it is tempting to propose that Afg3p-Rca1p and Yme1p would be involved in the biogenesis of both respiratory complexes and other protein complexes controlling mitochondrial compartment integrity, whereas Oxa1p would play a role only in export and assembly of the membrane subunits of respiratory complexes. In mitochondria, biogenesis of the respiratory complexes requires the expression of both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes (1Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 91-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grivell L.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

The mitochondrial genome encodes only a few subunits of the respiratory complexes, whereas the other subunits and a number of proteins, which are not intrinsic components of the complexes but are required for their biogenesis, are nuclearly encoded. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear gene OXA1encodes such an assembly-assisting factor that is required for the biogenesis of both cytochrome c oxidase (Cox)1 and ATPase (4Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F.

In addition to their proteolytic activity, these proteases seem to display a chaperone-like activity (25Paul M.-F. Tzagoloff A.

Guélin E. Grivell L.A. Curr. Genet. 1996; 30: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finally, Oxa1p as well as both protease complexes appear to be conserved through evolution, showing the importance of their function. The human, Arabidopsis, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe OXA1 genes have been identified using functional complementation of a yeast oxa1 mutation (30Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groudinsky O. Minet M.

Human cDNAs encoding proteins highly related to Afg3p-Rca1p have also been described, and one of them encodes paraplegin, which, when mutated, is responsible for a hereditary spastic paraplegia (33Casari G.

Genomics. 1999; 59: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this work, we have studied the relationships between Oxa1p and the two inner membrane AAA (ATPasesassociated with diverse cellular activities) proteases by analyzing the assembly and activity of the Cox and ATPase complexes in Δoxa1,Δoxa1Δafg3, and Δoxa1Δyme1 mutants. We show that membrane subunits of both complexes, whether mitochondrially or nuclearly encoded, are rapidly degraded in the absence of Oxa1p. Interestingly, neither Afg3p nor Yme1p is responsible for the degradation of Cox subunits, whereas F0-ATPase subunits are stabilized in the absence of Yme1p. The increased stability of the ATPase subunits in the Δoxa1Δyme1double mutant allows significant assembly to occur since oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity is restored. Altogether, our results suggest that Oxa1p is not essential for the export of ATPase subunits. In addition, although respiratory function is dispensable in S. cerevisiae, we show that the simultaneous inactivation of the AFG3 and YME1 genes is lethal. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that Oxa1p is specifically required for the stability of the membrane subunits of the Cox and ATPase complexes. Such specificity is consistent with the inner membrane location of Oxa1p and with a role in export and/or assembly of the membrane subunits of these two complexes. We then tested whether the unexported and/or unassembled membrane subunits could be the target of the known inner membrane protease complexes Yme1p and Afg3p-Rca1p.Concerning the Cox subunits, Cox2p is a known substrate of Yme1p (20Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,23Nakai T. Yasuhara T. Fujiki Y. Ohashi A. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1996; 7: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the complex Afg3p-Rca1p has been shown to participate in the degradation of Cox1p and Cox3p (21Guélin E. Rep M. Grivell L.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Artl H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Since pre-Cox2p export is blocked in the Δoxa1 mutant (11Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12He S. Fox T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1449-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Hell K. Herrmann J. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Yme1p is active in the intermembrane space, it is not surprising that Yme1p does not degrade pre-Cox2p in the Δoxa1 mutant. However, the fact that the inactivation of neither YME1 nor AFG3 could restore pre-Cox2p or the other Cox subunit stability suggests that either another protease is responsible for the degradation of these subunits or that they can be degraded by Yme1p and Afg3p-Rca1p. We rather favor the first hypothesis since the Cox subunits are still unstable when both Yme1p and Afg3p protease activities are blocked.It has been shown that the assembly of Cox1p, Cox2p, Cox3p, and Cox4p is interdependent (43Lemaire C. Robineau S. Netter P. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For example, in a cox2 mutant, the accumulation of the three other subunits is reduced. A specific pre-Cox2p export defect could then explain the general instability of most of the other Cox subunits found in Δoxa1strains. However, the fact that the suppressor mutations that compensate for the absence of Oxa1p fully compensate for the maturation defect of Cox2p but only partially restore Cox activity (10Hamel P. Lemaire C. Bonnefoy N. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Dujardin G. Genetics. 1998; 150: 601-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that Oxa1p is not required only for Cox2p export. Whether the primary function of Oxa1p in Cox biogenesis is linked to export of membrane subunits and/or their assembly still remains an open question, both processes being tightly linked.As far as the ATPase is concerned, we found that the F0membrane subunits are stabilized in the absence of Yme1p. Cross-linking experiments have shown that the subunits Atp4p, Atp6p, and Atp17p display accessible targets in the intermembrane space (41Spannagel C. Vaillier J. Chaignepain S. Velours J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to determine whether they all represent true targets of Yme1p or whether only one subunit is degraded by this protease and exerts a protective effect upon the others. Nevertheless, the restoration of oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity in the Δoxa1Δyme1 double mutant shows that the increased stability of the ATPase membrane subunits allows significant translocation and assembly to occur. This result suggests that Oxa1p is not essential for the export of the ATPase subunits.It has been proposed that the assembly of the three mitochondrially encoded subunits of the F0 sector (Atp6p, Atp8p, and Atp9p) occurs first and is required for the subsequent assembly of Atp4p and then Atp5p (44Hadikusumo R.G.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25690-25696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that Atp6p and Atp4p levels are dramatically reduced in the Δoxa1 strain, whereas Atp9p and Atp5p levels are not. For Atp9p, our results can be related to the data showing that Atp9p is associated with the F1 sector independently of the other F0subunits (44Hadikusumo R.G. Meltzer S. Choo W.M. Jean-François M.J.B. Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 933: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For Atp5p, our data suggest that its accumulation is independent of the formation of the F0 complex. In accordance with these results, we found that Atp5p was also stable in rho0 cells (data not shown), which are devoid of mitochondrial DNA and therefore of mitochondrially encoded subunits of F0.Finally, we have shown that the simultaneous absence of Afg3p (or Rca1p) and Yme1p is lethal and that viability is restored by the introduction of the proteolytically inactive variant of Afg3p. This suggests that Afg3p-Rca1p and Yme1p have an overlapping essential function that is probably due to the chaperone-like function. Alternatively, the cell viability might require both protease and chaperone activities to be functional. Although Oxa1p partially compensates for the AFG3 inactivation and could also display a “chaperone-like” function, the lethality of the double inactivation of AFG3 and YME1 cannot be cured by overexpressing the OXA1 gene (data not shown). It has been shown that the growth of Δyme1 rho − cells is severely affected (47Weber R.E. Rooks R.S. Shafer K.S. Chase J.W. Thorsness P.E. Genetics. 1995; 140: 435-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the lethality of the double mutant Δafg3Δyme1 is probably not simply due to the accumulation of rho − mutants since the percentage of rho − mutants is ∼15% in the Δafg3 mutant. In S. cerevisiae, respiratory function is dispensable, but the integrity of the mitochondrial compartment is essential. Thus, it is tempting to propose that Afg3p-Rca1p and Yme1p would be involved in the biogenesis of both respiratory complexes and other protein complexes controlling mitochondrial compartment integrity, whereas Oxa1p would play a role only in export and assembly of the membrane subunits of respiratory complexes. In this study, we show that Oxa1p is specifically required for the stability of the membrane subunits of the Cox and ATPase complexes.

The gene expression of this differentiation marker is induced by elevated extracellular calcium in cultured human keratinocytes. A 3.7-kilobase fragment of this gene contains the necessary elements to drive a luciferase reporter in a calcium-dependent manner. We have sequenced the upstream region of the involucrin promoter and localized a calcium response element that contains an activating protein-1 (AP-1) site (TGAGTCA). Mutation of this site abolished the promoter activation by calcium. Compared with cells grown in 0.03 mm calcium, the binding activity of factors within nuclear extracts from keratinocytes for this AP-1 site was enhanced 3-fold in cells grown in 1.2 mm calcium. Immunoelectrophoretic mobility shift (supershift) assays identified JunD, Fra1, and Fra2 as the major factors that bind to the AP-1 element. Western analysis of the proteins in the nuclear extracts showed that the levels of c-Jun, JunB, JunD, FosB, and Fra2 increased and the levels of c-Fos and Fra1 decreased slightly with calcium treatment. The effect of calcium on the involucrin promoter was enhanced synergistically by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in a protein kinase-dependent manner.

The increase in mRNA level is due at least in part to an increase in transcription; therefore, calcium is important for the transcriptional regulation of differentiation markers such as INV. In this report, we have characterized the INV gene for the presence of calcium-dependent elements. We found that an AP-1 site in the upstream region of the INV gene is essential for the calcium response. The vector pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) contains the luciferase reporter gene but is not linked to any promoter. The reporter in pGL3-promoter (Promega) is regulated by the SV40 promoter, and the reporter in pGL3-control (Promega) is regulated by the SV40 enhancer and promoter. DNA used for transfection and DNA sequence determination was propagated in Escherichia coliJM109 and was prepared using Qiagen Maxi-prep columns (Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Oligonucleotides were made by the Biomolecular Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco, or Cruachem (Dullus, VA). PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) was dissolved in Me2SO before being added to the cells. Stock solutions of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma) were prepared in ethanol. Calcium chloride was from Fisher Scientific (Tustin, CA), and calcium-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) was obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from either Fisher Scientific or Sigma. Construct INV-I was made by subcloning a 3.7-kb fragment that includes −2461 to +1228 bp of the INV gene from the H3700-pL2 (13Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the pGL3-basic vector. The numbering of the constructs and the INV promoter were based on the location of the 5′-ends relative to the transcription start site (+1) of the INV promoter. The 3.7-kb INV promoter was digested with NotI and SalI enzymes. The NotI overhang of the insert and the HindIII overhang of the vector were filled-in using T4 DNA polymerase and ligated to each other. The SalI overhang of INV was ligated to the compatible end of the XhoI of the vector. Truncation mutations −1880, −976, −797, and −156 from the 5′ direction, and +182 from the 3′ direction were made by first digesting INV-I with MluI+PflMI, KpnI,SmaI+NsiI, SmaI+ApaI, and XhoI, respectively. The overhangs were then repaired with T4 polymerase if necessary and ligated to form the truncated constructs. The splice site of each construct was sequenced to confirm its sequence integrity. Truncation constructs −2404 and −2196 were made by exonuclease and mung bean nuclease digestion (Exosize Kit, New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The location of each deletion site was determined by DNA sequencing. The “−3” construct was made by removing the intron of INV-1 using BlpI and XhoI enzymes. The vector fragment was then ligated with the aid of an adapter molecule made by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-TCATAGGATCCGC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGCGGATCCTA-3′. ABamHI site (underlined) was introduced to facilitate screening of this construct. The resultant construct contained −2461 to −3 bp of the INV promoter. Constructs Δ−1006:−156 and Δ−1880:−156 were made by removing the −1006 to −156 bp and −1880 to −156 bp, respectively, from construct INV-I using PflMI and ApaI enzymes. The PflMI site is at −1880 bp and the ApaI sites are at −1006 and −156 bp. Construct INV-II was made by removing the −1006 to −156 bp DNA fragment from the “−3” construct using the ApaI enzyme. Construct INV-116 was made by amplification of the region between −116 and −3 bp by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was subcloned into pGL3-basic. The sequence of the PCR-generated region was confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing using fluorescence dye terminators. The mutations −2180, −2130, −2026, and −1946 were prepared by PCR. The upstream primers used correspond to the 5′-end of the indicated positions of the INV gene. Constructs −2121 and M1 were made using oligonucleotides 5′-TCGATATGCCGTGAGTCAGAGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGATATGCCGTGAGcCAGAGGGC-3′, respectively, as upstream primers. The AP-1 site is underlined and the single base pair mutation of M1 is in lowercase. The downstream primer used was designed to hybridize with −1809 to −1790 bp of the INV gene downstream from the PflMI site (−1880). A 10-ng template DNA (construct INV-I) was first denatured 5 min in 10 μl of water at 94 °C under oil. An equal volume of a premixed solution was added to each tube so that the final reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 0.2 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP (Promega), 1 μm of each primer, 1 unit of Taq-Extender (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and 1 unit of Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA) in a thermocycler. The template was amplified for 30 cycles using the sequence 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. At the end of the last cycle, the reactions were further incubated at 72 °C for 6 min. PCR products were cut with PflMI and subcloned into the SmaI and PflMI sites of construct INV-II. The DNA sequence of the PCR-generated region of each construct was confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing using fluorescence dye terminators. The procedure for Polybrene-mediated transfection of primary human keratinocytes was modified from previously described protocols (18Ng D.C. Su M.-J. Kim R. Bikle D.D. Front. Biosci. (online). 1996; 1: a16-a24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Jiang C.K. Connolly D. Blumenberg M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 969-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, second passage human keratinocytes were cultured from neonatal foreskins (20Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Hincenbergs M. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and plated to a density of 400,000 cells per 60-mm culture dish in calcium-free KGM supplemented with 0.03 mm calcium. These cells were then incubated with a mixture of 2 μg of an experimental luciferase construct, 0.2 μg of pRSVbgal (13Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10270-10274Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and 15 μg of Polybrene (Aldrich) in 1.5 ml of KGM supplemented with 0.03 mm calcium for 6 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2on a rocker mixer. The cells were then treated with 2 ml of 10% glycerol in KGM for 3 min, washed twice with PBS (5 ml per plate), and incubated in 3 ml of KGM supplemented with 0.03 mm calcium for 16 h. Transfected cells were treated the next day with calcium and/or PMA. Each construct was tested in triplicates with two different cell preparations. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots (10 μl) of each cell extract were assayed with luciferase substrate (Promega) and β-galactosidase substrate Galacto-Light (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The luciferase activities reported were standardized with the β-galactosidase activities and normalized to the mean activity of cells transfected with the luciferase construct INV-I, which were grown in KGM with 0.03 mm calcium. The nucleotide sequence of the 581 bp between −2461 and −1880 bp of the INV-I construct was determined in both directions using an automatic sequencer employing fluorescence dye terminators by the Biomedical Research Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The following oligonucleotides were used: activating protein-1 (AP-1) (5′-TCGATATGCCGTGAGTCAGAGGGC3′ and 5′-TCGAGCCCCTCTGACTCACGGGCATA-3′); AP-1 mutants M1 (5′-TCGATATGCCGTGAGcCAGAGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCCCCTCTGgCTCACGGGCATA-3′); and M5 (5′-TCGATATGCCGaactgCAGAGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCCCCTCTGcagttCGGGCATA-3′). The AP-1 site of each oligonucleotide is underlined, and the lowercase letters denote mutations of the AP-1 site. Oligonucleotides AP-1 (1.5 pmol) were labeled with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) for 30 min at 37 °C. Specific activity of the DNA probe was approximately 6 × 10 6 cpm/pmol. Functional analysis of this AP-1 element and its M1 and M5 mutations was done by subcloning each element into the SalI site of the pGL3-basic vector containing the −156 to +3 region of the INV promoter. Mutations of the AP-1 sequence were confirmed by using an automatic sequencer employing fluorescence dye terminators. Nuclear extracts were prepared from preconfluent cells cultured in KGM supplemented with either 0.03 or 1.2 mm calcium for 48 h using a modified procedure developed by Abmayr and Workman (21Abmayr S.M. Workman J.L. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. DNA-Protein Interactions. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. II. Greene Pub. Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 12.2.1-12.2.7Google Scholar). Briefly, in addition to 0.2 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride specified by the original protocol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml Pepstatin, and 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (P2714, Sigma) were added to all the extraction buffers. 5 μg of each extract was added to a solution with final concentrations of the components of the mixture to be 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05 μg/ml poly-dI/poly-dC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 750 fmol of an unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide with a top strand sequence of 5′-TAGGTACCGAATGCATGC-3′, and 7.5 fmol of 32P-end-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide. The mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and resolved in nondenaturing acrylamide (5%) gel electrophoresis in Tris-boric-EDTA buffer (45 mm Tris base, 44 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The protein-DNA complex was then visualized by exposing the dried gel to Kodak (Rochester, NY) XMR film. The amount of32P in each band was quantitated by a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) Molecular Imager. The immuno-EMSA procedure was modified from the procedure described in Welter et al. (22Welter J.F. Crish J.F. Agarwal C. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12614-12622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of c-Jun (N, sc45), JunB (N-17, sc46), JunD (329, sc74), c-Fos (4, sc52), FosB (102, sc48), Fra1 (R-20, sc605), and Fra2 (Q-20, sc604) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) were added to 10 μg of nuclear extract made from keratinocytes grown in medium containing 1.2 mm calcium and were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. These samples were then incubated with 32P-end-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides as described before. 50 μg of nuclear extract was denatured in 2.5% SDS, 30 mm dithiothreitol, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) at 65 °C for 15 min, fractionated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The molecular mass measurements were based on Kaleidoscope prestained standards (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated in PBS with 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with non-immune rabbit IgG and rabbit antibodies specific to c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2 (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 16 h at 4 °C. Peptide neutralization of the c-Jun and JunB antibodies were done according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure; namely, antibodies were preincubated with a 5-fold (by weight) excess of peptide antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed four times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min each. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (NA934, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 20 °C and washed four times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min each. The membrane was then incubated with SuperSignal Ultra chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and an exposure was made on Kodak XMR film. A 3.7-kb fragment of the INV gene was subcloned in front of a luciferase reporter in the pGL3-basic vector. The reporter activity of the pGL3 vector alone was not inducible by calcium treatment, whereas the reporter activity of cells with the INV-1 construct was enhanced up to an average of 16-fold in a dose-dependent fashion after treatment with calcium (Fig. 1). The amount of lysate used for reporter activity was in the linear range of the assay system, and the activities of the 3.7-kb promoter constructs were within 20–30% of a positive control vector pGL3-prom, whose reporter activity is based on a SV40 promoter (data not shown). The INV mRNA level of the keratinocytes was highest 24 h after calcium treatment. Thus, luciferase activity of the reporter construct was measured at this time, which was the earliest time point that gave a consistent and significant increase in promoter activity. Reporter activity was highest at 0.7 mm calcium and remained high at 1.2 and 2.4 mm calcium (Fig. 1). These higher doses of calcium increased promoter activity, with 1.2 mmcalcium giving the most consistent result. Thus, calcium concentrations of 0.03 and 1.2 mm calcium were used in subsequent experiments to study the effects of calcium on the modified fragments of the INV gene. A repressor region was identified by 3′-deletions of the INV promoter. Deletion of either +182 to +1228 bp or −3 to +1228 bp enhanced the calcium-induced and basal activities 3-fold (Fig. 2 A); however, the -fold induction caused by calcium was not significantly affected. Thus, Exon 1 (+1 to +43 bp) and the intron (+44 to +1188 bp) appear to contain one or more repressors but no calcium-dependent cis element. The 5′-end of the INV promoter was characterized by making deletion constructs −1880, −976, −797, and −156. Although the full-length construct (INV-I) showed calcium-dependent activation of the luciferase gene of 13-fold (Fig. 2 A), the four deletion constructs that do not have the 5′-most region between −2461 and −1880 lost their basal and calcium-induced promoter activities (Fig.2 B). Thus, this 581-bp region appears to contain both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent enhancer elements. To confirm the enhancer activity of the 581-bp region, internal deletions of two regions were made (Fig. 2 C). Deletions of the region between −1006 and −156 bp did not significantly change the reporter activity of cells grown in either 0.03 or 1.2 mmcalcium. Therefore, this region does not contain any major basal or calcium-dependent element. However, removal of −1880 to −156 bp enhanced the basal reporter activity 30-fold, indicating the presence of a strong repressor between −1880 and −1006 bp. However, the effect of calcium on the reporter activities was reduced from 13- to 3-fold. Although the reduction in calcium-dependent activation may be due to limitation in the ability of calcium to further stimulate such high basal activity, these results suggest the presence of an enhancer element in this region that is important for the calcium-dependent activation of the INV gene. To optimize the calcium induction, construct INV-II containing both calcium response regions (−2461 to −1881 and −1880 to −1006) and the 156-bp proximal promoter was made so that the dominant calcium response region between −2461 and −1880 bp could be analyzed. Elevated calcium in the medium induced reporter activities of this construct 3- to 8-fold. DNA sequence of the 581-bp upstream region is shown in Fig.3 A. Two 5′-deletion constructs (−2409 and −2196) were made by exonuclease III/mung bean digestion. These deletions reduced both the basal and calcium-induced activity, but the activities of these constructs remained dependent on calcium (Fig. 3 B). Additional constructs with the 5′-end beginning at −2180, −2130, −2026, and −1946 bp were made using a PCR-based method. Deletion constructs −2180 and −2130 maintained their calcium response; however, the calcium response was lost with further deletions of the 5′-end (Fig. 3 B). The locations of the 5′-ends of all mutants and the nucleotide sequences of the PCR-generated fragments were confirmed with DNA sequencing. We observed large changes in the activity of the reporter constructs. The variation in activity ratio is a reflection of the changes in basal activity seen with successive deletions. Thus, the 3.7-kb construct was used as a reference in all the experiments. Examination of the region between −2130 and −2026 bp revealed an AP-1 site at −2114 to −2108 bp. To test the role of the AP-1 site in the calcium responsiveness, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the AP-1 site were introduced into construct −2026 in both the forward (For) and reverse (Rev) orientations at the SalI site of the pGL3 vector, 2 kb 3′ to the INV transcription start site. The AP-1 site of the INV gene appeared to be functional in both orientations (Fig.4) in that the calcium responsiveness of the “For” and “Rev” constructs were restored to the level of the −2130 construct. Truncation of the −2130 construct to −2121 bp (construct −2121) did not affect the reporter activity, but changing the T to a C at −2110 bp in the corresponding construct (M1) abolished its calcium inducibility to the level of the −2026 construct. Therefore, the AP-1 site at −2114 to −2108 bp is functional in keratinocytes and is essential for the calcium-induced promoter activity. To confirm the binding ability of this AP-1 site, oligonucleotides containing the INV AP-1 site were used as probes in EMSA. Nuclear extracts of the cells grown in 0.03 and 1.2 mm calcium were analyzed. Addition of nuclear extracts to the AP-1 oligonucleotide resulted in two shifted bands (Fig. 5 A). The intensity of these bands was three times higher in the gel lane, where nuclear extracts from cells grown in 1.2 mm calcium was used, than in the nuclear extracts from cells grown in 0.03 mm calcium, suggesting that the AP-1 binding factors were elevated in cells grown in 1.2 mm calcium. The top band appeared to be a result of specific binding of nuclear factors to the AP-1 site, because addition of homologous oligonucleotides completely abolished their binding to the probe. The lower band was less specific, in that competition by the unlabeled probe was incomplete. Addition of double stranded oligonucleotides containing a 5-bp substitution of the AP-1 site (M5) resulted in no competition, although addition of AP-1 oligonucleotides with a 1-bp substitution (M1) resulted in a modest inhibition of binding to the upper band. We then tested whether the two different mutations had different effects on involucrin promoter activity. The distal AP-1 element as well as the M1 and M5 mutations of this element were subcloned into a reporter construct that contained the proximal 156 bp of the INV promoter. Although the original AP-1 sequence enhanced the calcium dependence over 2-fold, both the M1 and M5 eliminated this activity (Fig. 5 B). Thus, even though it had lost its ability to activate the INV promoter in a calcium-dependent manner, the M1 mutation retained some ability to bind to nuclear proteinsin vitro. Because the AP-1 site also mediates the effects of phorbol esters, we evaluated the interactions between PMA and calcium on the INV gene expression. INV-I was transfected into keratinocytes grown in 0.03 mmcalcium, and, at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 56 h before harvest, 1.2 mm calcium or 10 nm PMA was added to the cells. Near-maximal calcium response was reached by 32 h, and the promoter activity remained elevated for at least 56 h (data not shown). PMA activation of the INV gene reached near-maximal levels by 16 h and remained elevated for at least 40 h. Although both increased the INV promoter activity, their time courses of action were different. When they were added separately, calcium and PMA enhanced reporter activities 5- and 41-fold, respectively (Fig.6). When cells were treated with both agents, the promoter activity was induced synergistically to 118-fold. The effects of calcium and PMA were abolished by pretreatment of the cells with 1 μm of a potent PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220. Therefore, protein kinase C (PKC) is likely to be involved in both the calcium and PMA activation of the INV promoter. Single base pair mutation of the AP-1 site in INV-I and INV-II resulted in loss of promoter activity (data not shown); therefore, we investigated the function of the AP-1 site in shorter constructs. We tested the effectiveness of the intact (AP-1) or 5-bp mutation (mut) of the distal INV AP-1 element (−2114 to −2108 bp) on the SV40 promoter, a 116-bp INV promoter (INV-116) that does not contain the proximal AP-1 site, and a 156-bp INV promoter (INV-156) that contains the proximal AP-1 site. Calcium enhanced the SV40 promoter and the 116-bp INV promoter 2-fold, but stimulated the 156-bp INV promoter 7-fold (Fig.7 A). The calcium effect was lost when the distal INV AP-1 element was mutated. Thus, these results suggest that both the distal and the proximal AP-1 sites are necessary for calcium regulation of the INV gene. The regulation by calcium of the INV promoter is different from that by PMA (Fig. 7 B). Introduction of the distal AP-1 site to the SV40 promoter of pGL3-basic enhanced the PMA-dependent promoter activity by 2-fold similar to that of calcium. However, this AP-1 element increased the PMA-dependent activation of the INV 116-bp promoter activity by 13-fold. In the presence of the INV 156-bp promoter, PMA increased the promoter activity by 72-fold. Like the calcium effect on these constructs, the PMA effect on the promoter activity was reduced when constructs containing the mutant forms of the distal AP-1 site were used. Because removal of the region between −156 and −116 in the INV 156-bp promoter also reduced the -fold induction of the promoter activity, both the proximal and the distal AP-1 sites appear to be required for optimal PMA effect. However, unlike calcium, PMA could stimulate promoter activity substantially with only one AP-1 site. Calcium and PMA appear to have different effects on the levels of the AP-1 proteins. The factors in the nuclear extracts that bind to the AP-1 element were identified using antibodies to c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2.

https://openalex.org/W2021107017,"We have previously demonstrated that formation of a complex between L-type calcium (Ca2+) channel α1C (CaV1.2) and β subunits was necessary to target the channels to the plasma membrane when expressed in tsA201 cells. In the present study, we identified a region in the C terminus of the α1C subunit that was required for membrane targeting. Using a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of the α1C subunit, a domain consisting of amino acid residues 1623–1666 (“targeting domain”) in the C terminus of the α1C subunit has been identified to be important for correct targeting of L-type Ca2+ channel complexes to the plasma membrane. Although cells expressing the wild-type α1C and β2a subunits exhibited punctate clusters of channel complexes along the plasma membrane with little intracellular staining, co-expression of deletion mutants of the α1C subunit that lack the targeting domain with the β2a subunit resulted in an intracellular localization of the channels. In addition, three other regions in the C terminus of the α1C subunit that were downstream of residues 1623–1666 were found to contribute to membrane targeting of the L-type channels. Deletion of these domains in the α1C subunit resulted in a reduction of plasma membrane-localized channels, and a concomitant increase in channels localized intracellularly.

The α1subunit is the channel pore-forming subunit, which contains binding sites for pharmacological agents or toxins and determines basic electrophysiological properties of different types of Ca2+channels. The accessory β and α2δ subunits play important roles in modulating Ca2+ channel function, including modulation of voltage-dependent properties and membrane targeting of channel complexes (1Mitterdorfer J.

For example, β1a subunit null mice express greatly reduced Ca2+ currents and dihydropyridine binding sites in skeletal muscle myotubes, suggesting that the β subunit plays critical roles in maintaining the expression of the α1 subunits (7Strube C.

All of the four known β subunits are very hydrophilic and have no known transmembrane domains (9Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg.

With few exceptions, these subunits are localized cytoplasmically when expressed in the absence of the α1 subunits (11Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Hosey M.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); this modification serves as a membrane targeting signal for this subunit (11Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In contrast to what is observed when the channel subunits are expressed alone, co-expression of the α1C subunit with any β subunit allows for membrane targeting of both proteins (4Chien A.J. Zhao X.

All β subunits contain two conserved domains in the central region flanked by unique N and C termini (9Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg.

A region in the second conserved domain of all β subunits has been identified to mediate interaction with the α1 subunits, and this region is termed the β-interaction domain (BID)1 (13Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 14De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

In addition, an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain has been mapped to the first conserved domain of β subunits (11Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutations of key residues in either the BID or the SH3 domain disrupt interaction between the α1and β subunits (11Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P.

More recently, we have demonstrated that mutations in the BID or the SH3 domains of β subunits also disrupt membrane targeting of the channels (12Gao T. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This finding, as well as the observation that membrane targeting of the α1C can occur with any β subunit (regardless of its state of palmitoylation), has led us to suggest that correct plasma membrane targeting of the calcium channel subunits requires complex formation between the α1 and β subunits rather than palmitoylation of the β subunit (12Gao T. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have addressed functional domains in the β subunit that are required for targeting calcium channel complexes to the plasma membrane (11Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), less is known about the role of the α1 subunit in the membrane targeting process. Recently, an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal in the I-II loop of the α1 subunit was identified and shown to be neutralized by interaction with a β subunit (15Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. DeWaard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Other studies have focused on the C terminus of the α1C subunit and shown that it is involved in multiple events regulating calcium channel functions. For example, a protein kinase A-mediated protein phosphorylation site that can modulate channel function has been mapped to residue serine 1928 in the C terminus of α1C subunit (16De Jongh K.S.

In addition, the C terminus of the α1C subunit contains interaction sites for the Ca2+-binding proteins sorcin (19Meyers M.B. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Gao T. Hsu P.H. Hosey M.M. Fishman G.I. J. Biol.

Ca2+-dependent inactivation and facilitation of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels may be mediated in part by association of calmodulin with the α1C subunit (20Zühlke R.D. Reuter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the C terminus of the α1C subunit contains elements that are inhibitory to channel activity, as deletion of parts of the C terminus resulted in increased Ca2+ current inXenopus oocytes expressing the L-type calcium channels (24Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E. Olcese R. Stefani E. Perez-Reyes E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1635-1640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of the C terminus of the α1C subunit in the membrane targeting of cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels. By using a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of the α1C subunit, we identified a region in the C terminus of the α1C subunit that was required for membrane targeting of the L-type Ca2+ channels. All reagents were obtained from general sources unless otherwise stated. The large T-antigen transformed human embryonic kidney cells (tsA201) were the generous gift of Dr. Richard Horn (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The Ca2+ channel subunit-specific antibodies used in this study including Card C, Card I, βGEN, and anti-β2antibodies were described previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F.

The pCR3α1CΔ1733 expression vector was the generous gift of Dr. Roman Shirokov (Rush University, Chicago, IL). The expression plasmid of the rabbit β2a, pCDNAβ2a, was the gift of Dr. Franz Hofmann (Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany). The expression plasmid pCR3α1CΔPRD was described previously (26Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Bünemann M. Puri T.S. Adair A. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8556-856326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit from CLONTECH was used to create C-terminal deletion mutants of the α1Csubunit, including pCR3α1CΔ2024, pCR3α1CΔ1905, pCR3α1CΔ1623, pCR3α1CΔ1900–2026 (ΔI), pCR3α1CΔ1733–1905 (ΔII), pCR3α1CΔC1623–1733 (ΔIII), pCR3α1CΔC1668–1733 (ΔIV), and pCR3α1CΔC1623–1666 (ΔV). The experimental procedures were carried out following the manufacturer's protocol. The truncation mutant plasmids pCR3α1CΔC2024, pCR3α1CΔ1905, and pCR3α1CΔ1623 were generated by introducing stop codons at amino acid residue 2025, 1906, and 1623 in the C terminus of α1C, respectively. The internal deletion mutant constructs pCR3α1CΔI, pCR3α1CΔII, pCR3α1CΔIII, pCR3α1CΔIV, and pCR3α1CΔV were created by deleting amino acid residues between the two indicated residues in the C terminus of α1C subunit. To generate an additional α1C subunit-specific antibody, a fusion protein encoding the second intracellular loop linking the transmembrane domains II and III (amino acid residues 738–940, termed CI2) of the α1C subunit was produced. The sequence in the CI2 region was amplified using PCR and subcloned into an expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resulting in an in-frame fusion of the CI2 residues to glutathione S-transferase (GST). The GST-CI2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified following standard procedures. Purified GST-CI2 fusion proteins were injected into a rabbit and polyclonal antibodies were prepared at Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). HEK tsA201 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient expression of different Ca2+ channel subunits in tsA201 cells was carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Different combinations of Ca2+ channel subunits were transfected into tsA201 cells, and immunofluorescence staining was performed ∼36–48 h after transfection. Prior to staining, cells were washed twice with PBS, followed by fixing in pre-cooled (−20 °C) methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5–10 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated in labeling buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 2% normal goat serum in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Different primary antibodies were diluted into the labeling buffer and incubated with cells for 1–2 h at room temperature. A secondary antibody, Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), was used subsequently. Coverslips were mounted onto slides and viewed on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM-510). For co-immunoprecipitation of α1 and β subunits, whole cell lysates were prepared from transfected tsA201 cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS containing protease inhibitors (Ref. 18Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with agitation at 4 °C using the CI2 antibody coupled to Protein A-Ultralink resin (Pierce). Immunoprecipitates were washed with the lysis buffer three to five times and eluted with SDS sample buffer. The Card I antibody was used to detect the wild-type (WT) and mutant α1C subunits on immunoblots, and detection was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce). The β2 subunits that were co-immunoprecipitated with the α1C subunits were detected by the anti-βGENantibody and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG and ECL (Pierce). To detect expression of functional L-type Ca2+ channels, ligand binding experiments were performed using the dihydropyridine (DHP) radioligand [3H]PN200-110 with intact cells transfected with different combinations of the channel subunits. The experimental procedures were as described previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Scatchard analyses were performed to assess B max andK d values. Transiently transfected tsA201 cells expressing different combinations of the Ca2+ channel subunits were used for electrophysiological studies. Approximately 36–40 h after transfection, Ba2+ currents through L-type calcium channels were measured in the whole cell configuration using the patch clamp technique as described previously (26Gerhardstein B.L.

Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To assess the role of different regions in the C terminus of the α1C subunit in membrane targeting of L-type Ca2+ channel complexes, several C-terminal deletion mutants of the α1C subunit were created by site-directed mutagenesis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two types of deletion mutants were generated. In one group of the mutants, including α1CΔ2024, α1CΔ1905, α1CΔ1733, and α1CΔ1623, different sized truncations of the C terminus were constructed such that new C termini were created (Fig. 1 A). In the other group of mutants, including α1CΔ1900–2026 (ΔI), α1CΔ1733–1905 (ΔII), α1CΔ1623–1733 (ΔIII), α1CΔ1668–1733 (ΔIV), and α1CΔ1623–1666 (ΔV), different regions within the C terminus of α1C were deleted internally (Fig. 1 A). In addition, a proline-rich domain (PRD) in the C terminus of the α1C subunit has been identified that may interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins (26Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Bünemann M. Puri T.S. Adair A. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8556-856326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus a PRD-deletion mutant, α1CΔPRD (α1CΔ1966–2004; Ref.26Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Bünemann M. Puri T.S. Adair A. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8556-856326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), was included in this study as well (Fig. 1 A). Since a functional interaction between the α1 and β subunits is required for correct membrane targeting of the Ca2+ channel complexes (12Gao T. Chien A.J. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2137-2144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we first tested whether these deletion mutants of the α1C subunit were able to associate with the β subunits. The wild-type and the mutant α1C subunits were co-transfected with the rabbit β2a subunit into tsA cells, and the channel proteins were immunoprecipitated from the transfected cells using an α1C subunit-specific antibody, CI2. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The different α1Csubunits were immunoprecipitated by CI2 and detected with Card I (Fig.1 B, upper panel). The molecular weight differences between the WT and individual mutant α1Csubunits reflected the number of amino acids that were deleted from the protein. The β2a subunits were co-immunoprecipitated with all different mutant α1C subunits from co-transfected cells, and detected on the bottom half of the blot with the anti-βGEN antibody (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). The expression level of different combinations of channel subunits varied somewhat among individual transfections; however, the amount of β2a subunit present in the immunoprecipitates appeared to roughly correlate with the amount of α1C subunit in the same immunoprecipitate (Fig.1 B). This result indicated that deletion of the C-terminal regions did not interfere with α1/β subunit interaction, suggesting that the overall conformation of the mutant α1C subunits was not drastically altered by the mutations. In addition, all mutants, with the exception of the α1CΔ1623, α1CΔIII, and α1CΔV, exhibited voltage-dependent barium currents that were equivalent to, or greater than, those recorded from the WT channels (Table I, Refs. 25Chien A.J.

As we routinely did not observe significant currents from α1C subunits expressed alone (data not shown), and since α1C/β subunit interactions have been demonstrated to be critical for obtaining functional channels (6De Waard M. Gurnett C.A. Campbell K.P. Narahashi T. Ion Channels. 4. Plenum Press, New York1996: 41-87Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar), these data further supported the contention that the mutant α1C proteins studied here interacted normally with β subunits.Table IMembrane targeting of the C-terminal mutants of the α1CsubunitMembrane targeting (% cells showing plasma membrane staining,n = 3)DHP binding (n ≥ 2)Functional L-type Ca2+ currents (n ≥ 6)mean ± S.E.WT α1C90 ± 2++α1CΔ202488 ± 2++α1CΔ190569 ± 2*++α1CΔ173340 ± 5*++α1CΔ1623NoNoNoα1CΔ1900–2025 (ΔI)69 ± 2*++α1CΔ1733–1905 (ΔII)79 ± 2*++α1CΔ1623–1733 (ΔIII)NoNoNoα1CΔ1623–1666 (ΔV)10.5 ± 1.3*N.D.Noα1CΔ1668–1733 (ΔIV)72 ± 3.5*N.D.+α1CΔPRD87 ± 1++Different α1C subunits were co-transfected with the β2a subunit into tsA201 cells.

Expression of functional L-type Ba2+ currents with peak current amplitude of ≥5 pA/pF is scored as “+.” To examine whether the C-terminal region of the α1C subunit was involved in targeting of the channel to the plasma membrane, we first asked if the C-terminal truncation mutants of the α1C subunit were impaired in membrane targeting. We used the rabbit β2a subunit in membrane targeting studies, as this subunit does not undergo palmitoylation like the rat β2a subunit and consequently cannot target to the plasma membrane unless it is complexed with an α1 subunit (11Chien A.J. Gao T. Perez-Reyes E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Different combinations of the mutant α1C subunits and the rabbit β2a subunit were co-expressed in tsA201 cells, and the transfected cells were immunostained with the α1Csubunit-specific antibody, CI2, to reveal the expression pattern of the channel. Consistent with the results that we reported previously (4Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), the WT α1C subunits were localized almost exclusively at the cell surface when co-expressed with the β subunits in tsA cells (Fig. 2 A), indicating that these proteins were targeted to the plasma membrane. Punctate clusters of channel complexes as detected by the CI2 antibody were observed along the cell surface (Fig. 2 A, indicated byarrows). The localization of the β2a subunits was examined using the β-subunit specific antibody in co-transfected cells, and the expression pattern was similar to that observed with the co-expressed WT α1C subunits (Fig. 2 B) (13Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Similarly, confocal images taken from cells expressing the C-terminal truncation mutant α1CΔ2024 and β2asubunits demonstrated that the α1CΔ2024 mutant subunits, together with the co-expressed β2a subunits, were targeted to the plasma membrane and formed punctate clusters (as indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, C andD). Among the WT α1Cβ2a-transfected cells, membrane staining of channel clusters"
https://openalex.org/W1984237607,"In this study, we identified lysine residues in the fibrinogen Aα chain that serve as substrates during transglutaminase (TG)-mediated cross-linking of plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2). Comparisons were made with α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP), which is known to cross-link to lysine 303 of the Aα chain. A 30-residue peptide containing Lys-303 specifically competed with fibrinogen for cross-linking to α2-AP but not for cross-linking to PAI-2. Further evidence that PAI-2 did not cross-link via Lys-303 was the cross-linking of PAI-2 to I-9 and des-αC fibrinogens, which lack 100 and 390 amino acids from the C terminus of the Aα chain, respectively. PAI-2 or α2-AP was cross-linked to fibrinogen and digested with trypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C, and the resulting peptides analyzed by mass spectrometry. Peptides detected were consistent with tissue TG (tTG)-mediated cross-linking of PAI-2 to lysines 148, 176, 183, 457 and factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of PAI-2 to lysines 148, 230, and 413 in the Aα chain. α2-AP was cross-linked only to lysine 303. Cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen did not compete with α2-AP, and the two proteins utilized different lysines in the Aα chain. Therefore, PAI-2 and α2-AP can cross-link simultaneously to the α polymers of a fibrin clot and promote resistance to lysis. In this study, we identified lysine residues in the fibrinogen Aα chain that serve as substrates during transglutaminase (TG)-mediated cross-linking of plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (PAI-2). Comparisons were made with α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP), which is known to cross-link to lysine 303 of the Aα chain. A 30-residue peptide containing Lys-303 specifically competed with fibrinogen for cross-linking to α2-AP but not for cross-linking to PAI-2. Further evidence that PAI-2 did not cross-link via Lys-303 was the cross-linking of PAI-2 to I-9 and des-αC fibrinogens, which lack 100 and 390 amino acids from the C terminus of the Aα chain, respectively. PAI-2 or α2-AP was cross-linked to fibrinogen and digested with trypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C, and the resulting peptides analyzed by mass spectrometry. Peptides detected were consistent with tissue TG (tTG)-mediated cross-linking of PAI-2 to lysines 148, 176, 183, 457 and factor XIIIa-mediated cross-linking of PAI-2 to lysines 148, 230, and 413 in the Aα chain. α2-AP was cross-linked only to lysine 303. Cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen did not compete with α2-AP, and the two proteins utilized different lysines in the Aα chain. Therefore, PAI-2 and α2-AP can cross-link simultaneously to the α polymers of a fibrin clot and promote resistance to lysis. factor XIII tissue transglutaminase plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 α2-antiplasmin Fibrinogen is a 340-kDa plasma protein and is a symmetrical dimer containing 29 disulfide bonds. Fibrinogen consists of 2 copies of Aα, Bβ, and γ polypeptide chains, which have molecular masses of 63.5, 56, and 47 kDa, respectively. Release of fibrinopeptides A and B by thrombin initiates rearrangement of the molecule to form fibrin fibrils (reviewed in Ref. 1Mosesson M.W. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of fibrin(ogen) by transglutaminases is responsible for generation of an insoluble, stable fibrin clot (1Mosesson M.W. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Transglutaminases catalyze formation of covalent ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine bonds. An acyl transfer reaction occurs where the γ carboxyamide group of a glutamine residue acts as the donor and the ε-amino group serves as an acyl acceptor (reviewed in Ref. 2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Cross-linking occurs only between the Aα and γ chains of aligned fibrin fibrils; the Bβ chain is not involved in cross-linking (1Mosesson M.W. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Initially, adjacent γ chains cross-link to form γ-γ dimers. This reaction occurs between glutamine 398 or 399 of one chain and lysine 406 of another fibrin fibril (3Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4486-4491Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Aα chains then polymerize to form higher molecular mass polymers; this reaction occurs more slowly than γ-γ dimer formation (4McKee P.A. Mattock P. Hill R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 738-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Many lysine residues have been implicated as substrates for cross-linking and subsequent generation of high molecular mass oligomers of Aα chain (5Fretto L.J. Ferguson E.W. Steinman H.M. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2184-2195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Sobel J.H. Gawinowicz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19288-19297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It has been found that multimerization of γ-γ dimers can occur over extended time periods (7Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28414-28419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor XIII (FXIII)1 and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) are two major members of the TG family and differ with respect to location and regulation (2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Plasma FXIII is found as a zymogen that consists of two A and two B subunits. The A subunit contains the catalytic domain and shows homology to tTG, which is a monomer. Thrombin is required for activation of FXIII, which is associated with fibrinogen in the plasma. This ensures that generation of fibrin is accompanied by FXIII-mediated cross-linking of fibrin to form a strong insoluble clot. Tissue transglutaminase has a broad distribution in tissues, where cells such as endothelial cells and macrophages have been found to synthesize tTG (2Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Both FXIII and tTG can cross-link fibrinogen, but the pattern of cross-linking differs. FXIII generates γ-γ dimers, whereas tTG cross-links hybrids of an Aα and γ chain (8Murthy S.N.P. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9679-9682Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cross-linked Aα-γ heterodimers were detected in plasma fibrinogen, indicative of tissue transglutaminase activity (9Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cross-linking that occurs between the chains of fibrinogen is not thought to contribute in a major way to resistance of a fibrin clot to lysis by plasmin. However, there has been controversy on this point. It has been shown that formation of γ-γ dimers did not affect fibrin lysis (10Gaffney P.J. Whitaker A.N. Thromb. Res. 1979; 14: 85-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), but formation of complex α-polymers increased resistance to fibrin lysis (11Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Blood. 1988; 71: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies have found that neither formation of γ-γ dimers nor of α polymers contributed to resistance of fibrin to lysis (12Rampling M.W. Thromb. Res. 1978; 12: 287-295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recent studies demonstrate that multimerization of γ-dimers after prolonged incubation of a fibrin clot decreased the rate of fibrin lysis (7Siebenlist K.R. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28414-28419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major way in which cross-linking affects resistance of a fibrin clot to lysis is when inhibitors of fibrinolysis are cross-linked to fibrin(ogen) (13Tamaki T. Aoki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 661: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The serine protease inhibitor (serpin), α2-AP, is the major physiological inhibitor of plasmin, which degrades fibrin. Localization of α2-AP along the fibrin strands by FXIII-mediated cross-linking decreased lysis of fibrin by plasmin (14Tamaki T. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14767-14772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2-AP has been shown to be cross-linked to fibrinogen via glutamine 2 of α2-AP and lysine 303 of the Aα chain (15Sakata Y. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Kimura S. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15591-15595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that PAI-2, an inhibitor of plasmin generation, was cross-linked to fibrinogen (17Ritchie H. Robbie L.A. Kinghorn S. Exley R. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PAI-2 inhibits fibrinolysis by neutralizing urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activator. This inhibits plasmin generation and subsequent fibrin degradation and/or extracellular matrix remodeling (18Kruithof E.K.O. Baker M.S. Bunn C.L. Blood. 1995; 86: 4007-4024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both tTG and FXIIIa were found to catalyze cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen (17Ritchie H. Robbie L.A. Kinghorn S. Exley R. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The glutamines on PAI-2 were identified as residues 83 and 86, which are found on an exposed loop between helices C and D. This unique 33-residue loop is distinct from the active site of PAI-2, and cross-linked PAI-2 remains active as an inhibitor of plasminogen activators (17Ritchie H. Robbie L.A. Kinghorn S. Exley R. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Jensen P.H. Lorand L. Ebbesen P. Gliemann J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that PAI-2 can be cross-linked to trophoblast membranes and to extracellular matrix, again via the exposed loop (20Jensen P.H. Schuler E. Woodrow G. Richardson M. Goss N. Hujrup P. Petersen T.E. Rasmussen L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15394-15398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular PAI-2 has been shown to inhibit programmed cell death, and this process was also dependent on the interhelical loop (21Dickinson J.L. Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Antalis T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27894-27904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This study investigated the lysine residues in fibrinogen that were involved in transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking of PAI-2. α2-AP is known to be cross-linked to fibrin(ogen) via lysine 303 in the Aα chain; therefore, cross-linking of α2-AP was compared with that of PAI-2. Interestingly, we have found that PAI-2 was not cross-linked via lysine 303 but utilized many other lysine residues in the Aα chain of fibrinogen. Fibrinogen for routine cross-linking reactions was purchased from Kabi (Sweden). Peak 1 fibrinogen was produced from fraction I-2 fibrinogen by anion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (22Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This material contained >80% intact Aα chains and was free of other protein contaminants. Fraction I-9 fibrinogen was prepared by subfractionation of the glycine precipitate of plasma (23Mosesson M.W. Sherry S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2829-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and lacked C-terminal Aα segments of ∼100 residues (24Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. Umfleet R.A. Galanakis D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5210-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mosesson M.W. Galanakis D.A. Finlayson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4656-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Des-αC fibrinogen (fraction I-9D) was produced from intact fibrinogen by limited plasmin digestion (25Mosesson M.W. Galanakis D.A. Finlayson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4656-4664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lacked C-terminal Aα segments of ∼390 residues (26Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Lucas J. Henschen A.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13577-13585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant 47-kDa non-glycosylated PAI-2 was kindly provided by Biotech Australia Ltd. Fibrinogen (1 μm) was incubated with 200 nmrecombinant PAI-2 or 200 nm α2-AP (Biopool, UK) in the absence or presence of 200 nm guinea pig liver transglutaminase (Sigma). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm CaCl2 typically for 30 min at 37 °C. Excess α2-AP or recombinant PAI-1 (28Sancho E.S. Tonge D.W. Hockney R.C. Booth N.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was incorporated into the reaction at a final concentration of 1.5 μm in some experiments. Peptides were synthesized in-house using a Pioneer peptide synthesizer (PE Biosystems) and were confirmed by mass spectrometry. These peptides were incorporated into cross-linking reactions at a final concentration of 1 mm. The sequence of the peptides corresponded to residues 290 to 319 of fibrinogen Aα chain and were as follows. K303, NPGSSGTGGTATWKPGSSGPGSTGSWNSGS R303, NPGSSGTGGTATWRPGSSGPGSTGSWNSGS Samples were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by solubilization in an equal volume of 8 m urea, 200 mm Tris, 4% w/v SDS, and 40 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were electrophoresed on 8% Prosieve (Flowgen, UK) acrylamide gels, which mimic a 4–12% acrylamide gradient, at a constant voltage of 125 V. Proteins were transferred overnight to nitrocellulose (Bio-Blot-NC, Costar, UK) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 20% v/v methanol. Transfer of protein was monitored by staining of the nitrocellulose with 1% w/v Ponceau S in 3% v/v trichloroacetic acid and destaining with distilled H20. Membranes were blocked with 50 mm bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, containing 3% w/v bovine serum albumin. Antigen was detected by binding of a mouse monoclonal antibody to PAI-2 (Biopool, 0.2 μg/ml) or a rabbit IgG preparation to α2-AP (Dako, 6 μg/ml). A rabbit antiserum (CS004) raised to a peptide corresponding to residues 601–608 of the fibrinogen Aα chain was provided by Drs. C. Stirk and W. T. Melvin, Dept. of Molecular & Cell Biology, University of Aberdeen and was used at a 1:1000 dilution. Detection was by either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and 0.6 mm 5′-bromo 4′-chloro 3-indolyl-phosphate and 0.5 mm nitro blue tetrazolium in 200 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5. Fibrinogen (Kabi, 2 mg) was cross-linked using 300 μg of guinea pig liver transglutaminase and 2.5 mmCaCl2 in the absence or presence of 800 μg PAI-2 or α2-AP for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were reduced and carboxymethylated (16Kimura S. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15591-15595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Doolittle R.F. Cassman K.G.

Chem. 1963; 238: 622-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and taken up in 0.1 mTris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8, containing 6 murea. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 50 mm under a nitrogen atmosphere and incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by a further 30-min incubation in the presence of 500 mm iodoacetamide. Samples were separated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 in the presence of 8 murea. PAI-2/α2-AP that was cross-linked to fibrinogen was detected in fractions by immunoblotting using either a monoclonal antibody to PAI-2, polyclonal antibody to α2-AP or polyclonal antibody to fibrinogen (Dako). Three fractions were identified as containing cross-linked material and were pooled, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Alternatively, 6 μm fibrinogen was cross-linked to 6 μm PAI-2 or α2-AP in the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2, 600 nm tTG or 600 nm FXIIIa, and 0.4 units/ml thrombin for 2 h before electrophoresis on a 4–12% NuPage acrylamide gel (Novex) under reducing conditions. Cross-linked products were stained with Coomassie Blue, and individual cross-linked bands were excised from the gel and digested. Cross-linked samples were digested overnight with 0.5 μg of porcine trypsin (Promega, UK) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate or with 0.5 μg endoproteinase Glu-C from Staphylococcus aureus(V8, Promega) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, vacuum-dried, and dissolved in 500 μl of 10% formic acid. The peptides obtained were desalted on a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography microcolumn. Masses of the peptides were determined on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems Voyager STR). Samples were prepared in either sinapinic or α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrices. Predicted masses of tryptic and endopeptidase Glu-C peptides of fibrinogen, PAI-2, and α2-AP were calculated using the PeptideMass software package available from the ExPASy web site. All experiments were carried out at least five times except the gel filtration and trypsin digestion analysis of cross-linked samples, which was performed on two separate occasions. Cross-linking of PAI-2 to the α chains of fibrinogen was examined by immunoblotting for the Aα chain and for PAI-2. Free Aα chains were seen at ∼63.5 kDa (Fig.1, lane a). Cross-linking of fibrinogen by tTG resulted in the formation of α polymers at approximately 100, 210, 240, 270 kDa (lane b). Immunoblotting of the same samples for PAI-2 demonstrated free PAI-2 at ∼47 kDa and a degradation product (∼37 kDa, lane c). The addition of tTG generated higher molecular mass cross-linked PAI-2 at 210, 240, and 270 kDa (lane d), which was consistent with PAI-2 that was cross-linked to α polymers. Some cross-linked PAI-2 was detected at approximately 110 kDa, and this is likely to represent PAI-2 cross-linked to one Aα chain. The time dependence for cross-linking of PAI-2 (Fig.2 A) and α2-AP (Fig. 2 B) to fibrinogen was compared (0–60 min). Both these inhibitors were cross-linked rapidly to fibrinogen, and high molecular cross-linked products (>200 kDa) were identified within 5 min of adding tTG. Cross-linked products of PAI-2 and α2-AP increased from 5 to 60 min in a time-dependent manner, but most cross-linking occurred within 30 min. Free α2-AP was seen at ∼65 kDa. Cross-linked products of α2-AP were similar to those of PAI-2 and were detected at ∼140 kDa, which was consistent with α2-AP cross-linked to one Aα chain and at >200 kDa; this represented α2-AP cross-linked to Aα polymers. The role of lysine 303 of the fibrinogen Aα chain in cross-linking to PAI-2 was investigated by incorporation of peptides corresponding to residues 290 to 319 of the Aα chain of fibrinogen. Peptide K303 contained lysine 303, and the control peptide, R303, had lysine 303 replaced with an arginine residue. The effect of the peptides on cross-linking of fibrinogen to PAI-2 and α2-AP was studied by immunoblotting. Cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen was not affected by either peptide K303 or R303 (Fig. 3 A); higher molecular mass cross-linked PAI-2 (>200 kDa) was still evident in the presence of either peptide (Fig. 3 A). This was in contrast to cross-linking of α2-AP, which was inhibited by peptide K303, whereas peptide R303 had no effect (Fig. 3 B). Neither peptide affected cross-linking of fibrinogen chains as assessed by protein stain of fibrinogen (data not shown). Cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen was investigated in the presence of excess α2-AP or PAI-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis that is not cross-linked to fibrinogen (17Ritchie H. Robbie L.A. Kinghorn S. Exley R. Booth N.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Neither α2-AP nor PAI-1 competed with cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen, even when present in 10-fold molar excess (Fig.4). In addition, cross-linking of PAI-2 or α2-AP to fibrinogen was not affected by equimolar concentrations of α2-AP or PAI-2, respectively (data not shown). These data show that α2-AP and PAI-2 could be cross-linked simultaneously to fibrinogen. The regions of the Aα chain involved in cross-linking of PAI-2 and α2-AP to fibrinogen were studied using preparations of truncated fibrinogens (22Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 23Mosesson M.W. Sherry S. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2829-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Mosesson M.W.

I-9 fibrinogen lacks ∼100 amino acids from the C terminus of the Aα chain and has lysine 303. Des-αC fibrinogen lacks the final ∼390 residues of the Aα chain and, therefore, lacks lysine 303. PAI-2 was cross-linked to all three fibrinogens (Fig. 5 A), and high molecular mass PAI-2 (>200 kDa) was generated following the addition of tTG (Fig. 5 A, lanes b, d, and f)). The degree of PAI-2 cross-linking was dependent on the length of the Aα chain in that most cross-linking was seen with Peak I fibrinogen. Cross-linking of α2-AP to des-αC fibrinogen was not evident (Fig. 5 B), consistent with cross-linking of α2-AP to lysine 303. Similar degrees of cross-linked α2-AP were evident with Peak I and I-9 fibrinogen. The lysine residues in fibrinogen that were involved in transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking to PAI-2 were identified by mass spectrometry of peptides digested by either trypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C. Cross-linked products were separated, identified on the basis of immunoblotting, and were digested for analysis by mass spectrometry. Cross-linking of fibrinogen to α2-AP was used for comparison, whereas that of fibrinogen alone served as a control; peptides found in this sample and common to all three reactions were omitted from the analysis. Only peptides specific to cross-linked PAI-2 or cross-linked α2-AP were analyzed and were compared with predicted values, as judged both by the disappearance of particular peptides and the generation of larger cross-linked peptides. Analysis of tryptic peptides of cross-linked PAI-2 is summarized in Table IA and was consistent with cross-linking of PAI-2 to numerous peptides of the Aα chain. These peptides contained lysine residues 183 or 457, 148, 176 or 224, and 230. Peptides (4093–4410 Da) corresponded to one tryptic peptide of PAI-2 (residues 57–87) containing glutamines 83–86 (3486.6 Da), which was cross-linked to one tryptic peptide of the Aα chain. Larger tryptic peptides were also detected (5729–6258 Da), and these represented PAI-2 cross-linked to two Aα chain peptides. Both of these larger peptides corresponded to region 142–148, which contained lysine 148 and glutamine 143, which participates in further cross-linking between Aα chains. Endopeptidase Glu-C (V8 fromS. aureus) digestion of PAI-2 cross-linked to fibrinogen by tTG yielded peptides of 2426.1, 2521.4, 2727.5, 2824.1 Da (Table IA), which corresponded to residues 75–92 of PAI-2 (2050.9 Da) cross-linked to peptides of 375.2, 470.5, 676.6, and 773.2 Da. These peptides of the Aα chain contain lysines 176, 457, 148, and 183, respectively (TableIA). No larger peptides were detected on digestion with endopeptidase Glu-C. Therefore, digestion of cross-linked PAI-2 with trypsin and endopeptidase Glu-C has demonstrated that lysines 148, 176, 183, and 457 on the Aα chain of fibrinogen mediate cross-linking to PAI-2 by tTG.Table ITrypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C-digested peptides of tTG-catalyzed cross-linked PAI-2 and/or α2-APAPredicted massTryptic peptidesExperimental massDaDa4090.057–87 PAI-2 + 220–224 Aα4093.04090.057–87 PAI-2 + 172–176 Aα4093.04242.157–87 PAI-2 + 225–230 Aα4244.44291.157–87 PAI-2 + 142–148 Aα4289.94410.157–87 PAI-2 + 449–457 Aα4410.04412.057–87 PAI-2 + 177–183 Aα4410.05732.957–87 PAI-2 + 142–148 Aα + 207–219 Aα5729.46254.857–87 PAI-2 + 142–148 Aα + 30–44 Aα6257.5Predicted massEndopeptidase Glu-C-digested peptidesExperimental massDaDa2425.875–92 PAI-2 + 175–177 Aα2426.12521.175–92 PAI-2 + 455–458 Aα2521.42726.075–92 PAI-2 + 147–151 Aα2727.52824.175–92 PAI-2 + 181–186 Aα2824.1BPredicted massTryptic peptidesExperimental massDaDa7932.51–12 α2-AP + 290–348 Aα + 71–78 Aα7932.78287.21–12 α2-AP + 290–348 Aα + 130–138 Aα + 428–429 Aα8287.08281.21–12 α2-AP + 290–348 Aα + 184–191 Aα + 445–448 Aα8281.08441.01–12 α2-AP + 290–348 Aα + 24–29 Aα + 408–413 Aα8440.9Trypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C-digested peptides specific to cross-linked PAI-2 (A) and tryptic peptides specific to cross-linked α2-AP (B) were compared with predicted peptide masses.

Peptides of the Aα chain that were involved in cross-linking of the Aα-Aα chain are shown in italics. FXIIIa-mediated cross-linking of PAI-2 to the Aα chain of fibrinogen was also analyzed using enzymatic digestion and mass spectrometry. Detection of tryptic peptides revealed the presence of residues 57–87 of PAI-2 (3486.6 Da), which was cross-linked to regions 142–148, 225–230, and 408–413 of the Aα chain of fibrinogen (TableII). These peptides contained lysines 148, 230, and 413. Endopeptidase Glu-C digestion of FXIIIa-cross-linked PAI-2 yielded peptides of 2428.1, 2639.8, 2726.1 Da, which corresponded to regions 175–177, 173–177, and 147–151 of the Aα chain of fibrinogen cross-linked to region 75–92 of PAI-2. This demonstrated the importance of lysines 148, 176, 230, and 413 in FXIIIa-mediated cross-linking of PAI-2 to fibrinogen.Table IITrypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C-digested peptides of FXIIIa-catalyzed cross-linked PAI-2Predicted massTryptic peptidesExperimental massDaDa4242.057–87 PAI-2 + 225–230 Aα4241.94291.057–87 PAI-2 + 142–148 Aα4290.94293.057–87 PAI-2 + 408–413 Aα4294.1Predicted massEndopeptidase Glu-C-digested peptidesExperimental massDaDa2426.175–92 PAI-2 + 175–177 Aα2428.12640.275–92 PAI-2 + 173–177 Aα2639.82727.375–92 PAI-2 + 147–151 Aα2726.1Trypsin or endopeptidase Glu-C-digested peptides specific to cross-linked PAI-2 were compared with predicted peptide masses.

Peptides of PAI-2 are highlighted in bold, and the Aα chain peptides that were cross-linked to PAI-2 are shown in regular text. Tryptic peptides of cross-linked α2-AP (Table IB) were consistent with cross-linking by tTG via glutamine 2 of α2-AP and lysine 303 of the Aα chain of fibrinogen. The donor glutamine is found within a peptide from residues 1 to 12 (1369.8 Da). Lysine 303 is contained within a 5534.5 Da peptide, corresponding to residues 290 to 348 of the Aα chain. Tryptic peptides that were detected corresponded to α2-AP cross-linked either to two or three Aα chains for tTG-mediated cross-linking (Table IB). Cross-linking was seen between Gln-2 of α2-AP and lysine 303 of Aα with further polymerization to another Aα chain between glutamine 328 and lysine 78. Gln-328 has previously been shown to act as a glutamine donor during polymerization of the Aα chains (31Cottrell B.A. Strong D.D. Watt K.W.K. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5405-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The tryptic peptide of the Aα chain from residues 290 to 348, which contains both Gln-328 and Lys-303, can therefore direct cross-linking between Aα chains and between α2-AP and Aα chains. Some larger peptides (8287–8441 Da) were also detected, which suggested cross-linking of α2-AP to polymers containing three Aα chains. This implies that additional glutamine residues can direct cross-linking of Aα-Aα chains as well as glutamine 328. Digestion of cross-linked α2-AP with endopeptidase Glu-C did not yield any specific peptides, which probably reflects the large size of the α2-AP peptide (residues 1–115, 12232.4 Da) and the peptide containing lysine 303 (residues 266–347, 7663.4 Da), neither of which was detected in the mass spectrometer. FXIIIa-mediated cross-linking of α2-AP to fibrinogen was also analyzed, and a single specific tryptic peptide of 6902.5 Da was detected, corresponding to α2-AP (residues 1–12, 1369.8 Da) cross-linked to lysine 303 (residues 290–348, 5534.5 Da), which agreed with previously published results (16Kim"

Furthermore, blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), another member of the transglutaminase family that is highly homologous to tTG, and propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF) also promoted cell adhesion through α9β1 or α4β1 in G-361 or MOLT-3 cells, respectively.

Each integrin is composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits, and the combination of α and β subunits generates many different receptors with different ligand specificity.Integrin α subunits can be grouped into subfamilies based on sequence similarity, and these subfamilies generally define integrins that share common ligands. Thus, α subunits can be divided into five groups (6Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 7Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Biol.

Somewhat surprisingly, the initial ligands identified for α9 and α4-containing integrins did not appear to overlap. Thus, for example, the integrin α4β1 was found to recognize fibronectin (10Guan J.L. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1990; 60: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Mould A.P.

Meininger G.A. Scholtz J.M. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that α4β1 recognizes osteopontin as a ligand, and Taooka et al. (18Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that α9β1 recognizes VCAM-1. It thus appears that the α4β1- and α9β1-integrins, like other integrins that are related based on α subunit sequence homology, do share at least some common ligands.In the present study, we demonstrate that three additional proteins are ligands for both α9β1 and α4β1. The first is a tissue-type transglutaminase (tTG). This protein belongs to a family of transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) that catalyze ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-link formation between specific substrate proteins (19Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv.

Cell Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and are distributed widely in various tissues. The second is blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII). This protein is also a member of the transglutaminase family and has an important role in the final stage of the blood coagulation cascade. The last is the propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF). This protein is obtained from a large precursor of von Willebrand factor by specific cleavage during biosynthesis and is stored in granules of both endothelial cells and platelets (22Verweij C.L. Diergaarde P.J. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of pp-vWF, we have mapped the recognition sequence for both integrins to the same cell adhesion site, a 15-residue linear sequence that we have previously shown is required for α4β1-mediated adhesion to this protein (24Isobe T.

In this report, we describe three additional ligands, tTG, FXIII, and pp-vWF. Among the previously identified α9β1 ligands, VCAM-1 and osteopontin have both been reported to be recognized by both α9β1 and the structurally related integrin α4β1 (17Bayless K.J. Meininger G.A. Scholtz J.M. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that each of the three new α9β1 ligands we identified is also a ligand for α4β1.Although it might seem reasonable to assume that α9β1 and α4β1recognize the same adhesive sites in shared ligands, this is not necessarily the case. There are numerous examples of different integrins recognizing distinct sites in the same ligand. For example, at least five integrins can recognize the third fibronectin type III repeat in tenascin-C as a ligand, but four of them recognize the RGD site in the F-G loop, whereas α9β1 clearly recognizes a different sequence, AEIDGIEL, in the B-C loop present on the same face of the protein (14Yokosaki Y.

Similarly, both the integrins αvβ3 and α9β1recognize a thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin as a ligand (15Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), but αvβ3 binds to an RGD site, whereas α9β1 binds to the adjacent sequence, SVVYGLR (16Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Sasaki T. Murakami I. Schneider H. Higashiyama S. Saitoh Y. Yamakido M. Taooka Y. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36328-36334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In fact, prior to the present report, there was no definitive evidence that α9β1 and α4β1 could recognize the same site in a shared ligand. The evidence presented in this report that both integrins recognize the same linear peptide, T2–15, within pp-vWF is to our knowledge the first conclusive evidence that these integrins can recognize the same cell adhesion site within one molecule (TableI). Interestingly, the sequence of this peptide, DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ, bears little resemblance to the previously identified α9β1-recognition sequences in tenascin-C and osteopontin. This observation provides additional evidence that α9β1 can recognize a surprisingly broad array of adhesive ligands. Taken together, the accumulated evidence that α9β1 and α4β1 share five ligands and, at least in one instance, recognize the same linear peptide within a ligand confirms the utility of α subunit sequence comparisons for predicting ligand binding specificity of integrin heterodimers.Table IVarious adhesion ligands that are recognized by α9β1 and/or α4β1 integrinα9β1α4β1Fibronectin×○(ILDV)VCAM-1○○(IDSP)Tenascin-C○(AEIDGIEL)?Ostcopontin○(SVVYGLR)○pp-vWF○○(DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ)tTG○○FXIII○○Adhesion to various ligands is illustrated according to the results obtained by ourselves and other investigators. ○, recognition of the integrin; ×, no recognition of the integrin; ?, no determination. The proposed essential cell adhesion sequences are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The interaction between tTG and integrins is likely to be biologically significant. tTG directly binds to a number of components of the extracellular matrix, including osteopontin and tenascin-C, where it plays an important role in matrix protein cross-linking. A recent report demonstrated that tTG bound to the integrins α5β1 and αIIbβ3within the secretory apparatus prior to appearance of the integrins on the cell surface, thereby suggesting a mechanism for localization of tTG to its extracellular targets (32Akimov S, A. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same study showed that the interaction of integrins with tTG enhanced cell attachment and spreading on fibronectin. The findings in the present study greatly expand the complexity of these potential interactions and suggest that similar mechanisms could be involved in cellular interactions with additional sites in fibronectin (e.g. the CS-1 site) and with a broad array of extracellular matrix ligands. Recently, as noted above, Akimov and co-workers reported that tTG could interact with several members of the integrin family, including α5β1 (as we also report in the current study), but also α1β1, α3β1, αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 (32Akimov S, A. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the report by Akimov et al. demonstrated that the related transglutaminase family member, FXIII, was not a ligand for α5β1, and thus suggested that the interactions between integrins and transglutaminases was specific for tTG. Although that report and this one both described interactions between α5β1 and tTG, there were several substantial differences. For example, Akimov et al. found no effect of either GRGDSP peptide or anti-β1 antibody on the interaction between tTG and integrins they describe, whereas in this report we found that GRGDSP completely eliminated the residual adhesion of G-361 cells to tTG once α9β1-mediated adhesion was inhibited, and we also found complete inhibition with anti-β1 antibody. Furthermore, we found no role for integrins other than α4β1, α5β1, or α9β1 in the adhesion of MOLT-3 or G-361 cells to tTG. We have checked the expression of various integrin subunits other than those shown in Fig. 2. As is clearly depicted in Fig. 10, G-361 cells also expressed α2, α3, α6, and αvβ3. MOLT-3 cells, however, did not express these integrins substantially. Results obtained with G-361 cells further substantiate the notion that these integrins are not involved in the adhesion of G-361 cells to tTG. There are several possible explanations for these differences. One obvious difference is that Akimov et al. were examining the effects of tTG on cell adhesion to the 42-kDa fragment of fibronectin, and in their case the tTG was supplied to integrins within the secretory apparatus of the same cell, whereas the present study examined adhesion to immobilized tTG. Under the conditions examined by Akimov et al., it is conceivable that blocking antibodies and GRGDSP peptide would not be able to displace already bound tTG, whereas these reagents were perfectly capable of binding to unligated integrin under the conditions used in the present study, thereby blocking subsequent interactions with tTG. Such an explanation is plausible because it is often more difficult to detach already adherent cells with integrin-blocking reagents than to block the attachment of suspended cells. Alternatively, the WI-38 cells and HEL cells used by Akimov et al. and the MOLT-3 cells and G-361 cells used in the present study could interact with tTG through different mechanisms.The results of the present study also clearly demonstrate that although α5β1 is not a receptor for inactive FXIII, both α4β1 and α9β1 are. These findings appear to differ from our previous report suggesting that α5β1 did contribute to adhesion of TIG-1 cells to FXIII. However, the adhesion observed in those experiments required that the FXIII be activated. The results of the present study confirm that α5β1 on G-361 cells can also mediate adhesion to activated FXIII (data not shown). We are uncertain whether the requirement for activation in this case is due to a conformational change in FXIII upon activation that unmasks an α5β1 binding site or to a requirement for enzymatic activity to induce α5β1-mediated adhesionThe interaction of α4β1 and α9β1 with FXIII could be biologically significant. Both α4β1 and α9β1 are highly expressed on specific populations of leukocytes, where they play a prominent role in transendothelial leukocyte migration. As a member of the coagulation cascade, FXIII is likely to be enriched at sites of vascular injury and inflammation, where its interaction with α4β1 and α9β1could promote leukocyte extravasation.We speculated previously about the function of pp-vWF as an emergency tag for targeting of α4β1-expressing leukocytes, together with VCAM-1, to sites of inflammation and injury (24Isobe T.

Integrins are a family of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that mediate cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions and play important roles in a wide variety of cellular events (1Hynes R.O.

Each integrin is composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits, and the combination of α and β subunits generates many different receptors with different ligand specificity. Integrin α subunits can be grouped into subfamilies based on sequence similarity, and these subfamilies generally define integrins that share common ligands. Thus, α subunits can be divided into five groups (6Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 7Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Biol.

Somewhat surprisingly, the initial ligands identified for α9 and α4-containing integrins did not appear to overlap. Thus, for example, the integrin α4β1 was found to recognize fibronectin (10Guan J.L. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1990; 60: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Mould A.P.

Meininger G.A. Scholtz J.M. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that α4β1 recognizes osteopontin as a ligand, and Taooka et al. (18Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that α9β1 recognizes VCAM-1. It thus appears that the α4β1- and α9β1-integrins, like other integrins that are related based on α subunit sequence homology, do share at least some common ligands. In the present study, we demonstrate that three additional proteins are ligands for both α9β1 and α4β1. The first is a tissue-type transglutaminase (tTG). This protein belongs to a family of transglutaminases (EC 2.3.2.13) that catalyze ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-link formation between specific substrate proteins (19Folk J.E. Finlayson J.S. Adv. Protein Chem. 1977; 31: 1-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 20Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 21Lorand L. Conrad S.M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1984; 58: 9-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and are distributed widely in various tissues. The second is blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII). This protein is also a member of the transglutaminase family and has an important role in the final stage of the blood coagulation cascade. The last is the propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF). This protein is obtained from a large precursor of von Willebrand factor by specific cleavage during biosynthesis and is stored in granules of both endothelial cells and platelets (22Verweij C.L. Diergaarde P.J. Hart M. Pannekoek H. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Wagner D.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 217-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of pp-vWF, we have mapped the recognition sequence for both integrins to the same cell adhesion site, a 15-residue linear sequence that we have previously shown is required for α4β1-mediated adhesion to this protein (24Isobe T.

DISCUSSIONPrevious reports identified three ligands for the integrin α9β1, VCAM-1 (18Taooka Y. Chen J. Yednock T. Sheppard D. J.

In this report, we describe three additional ligands, tTG, FXIII, and pp-vWF. Among the previously identified α9β1 ligands, VCAM-1 and osteopontin have both been reported to be recognized by both α9β1 and the structurally related integrin α4β1 (17Bayless K.J. Meininger G.A. Scholtz J.M. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Elices M.J. Osborn L. Takada Y. Crouse C. Luhowskyj S. Hemler M.E. Lobb R.R. Cell. 1990; 60: 577-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1508) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that each of the three new α9β1 ligands we identified is also a ligand for α4β1.Although it might seem reasonable to assume that α9β1 and α4β1recognize the same adhesive sites in shared ligands, this is not necessarily the case. There are numerous examples of different integrins recognizing distinct sites in the same ligand. For example, at least five integrins can recognize the third fibronectin type III repeat in tenascin-C as a ligand, but four of them recognize the RGD site in the F-G loop, whereas α9β1 clearly recognizes a different sequence, AEIDGIEL, in the B-C loop present on the same face of the protein (14Yokosaki Y.

Similarly, both the integrins αvβ3 and α9β1recognize a thrombin-cleaved N-terminal fragment of osteopontin as a ligand (15Smith L.L. Cheung H.K. Ling L.E. Chen J. Sheppard D. Pytela R. Giachelli C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28485-28491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), but αvβ3 binds to an RGD site, whereas α9β1 binds to the adjacent sequence, SVVYGLR (16Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Sasaki T. Murakami I. Schneider H. Higashiyama S. Saitoh Y. Yamakido M. Taooka Y. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36328-36334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In fact, prior to the present report, there was no definitive evidence that α9β1 and α4β1 could recognize the same site in a shared ligand. The evidence presented in this report that both integrins recognize the same linear peptide, T2–15, within pp-vWF is to our knowledge the first conclusive evidence that these integrins can recognize the same cell adhesion site within one molecule (TableI). Interestingly, the sequence of this peptide, DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ, bears little resemblance to the previously identified α9β1-recognition sequences in tenascin-C and osteopontin. This observation provides additional evidence that α9β1 can recognize a surprisingly broad array of adhesive ligands. Taken together, the accumulated evidence that α9β1 and α4β1 share five ligands and, at least in one instance, recognize the same linear peptide within a ligand confirms the utility of α subunit sequence comparisons for predicting ligand binding specificity of integrin heterodimers.Table IVarious adhesion ligands that are recognized by α9β1 and/or α4β1 integrinα9β1α4β1Fibronectin×○(ILDV)VCAM-1○○(IDSP)Tenascin-C○(AEIDGIEL)?Ostcopontin○(SVVYGLR)○pp-vWF○○(DCQDHSFSIVIETVQ)tTG○○FXIII○○Adhesion to various ligands is illustrated according to the results obtained by ourselves and other investigators. ○, recognition of the integrin; ×, no recognition of the integrin; ?, no determination. The proposed essential cell adhesion sequences are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab The interaction between tTG and integrins is likely to be biologically significant. tTG directly binds to a number of components of the extracellular matrix, including osteopontin and tenascin-C, where it plays an important role in matrix protein cross-linking. A recent report demonstrated that tTG bound to the integrins α5β1 and αIIbβ3within the secretory apparatus prior to appearance of the integrins on the cell surface, thereby suggesting a mechanism for localization of tTG to its extracellular targets (32Akimov S, A. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same study showed that the interaction of integrins with tTG enhanced cell attachment and spreading on fibronectin. The findings in the present study greatly expand the complexity of these potential interactions and suggest that similar mechanisms could be involved in cellular interactions with additional sites in fibronectin (e.g. the CS-1 site) and with a broad array of extracellular matrix ligands. Recently, as noted above, Akimov and co-workers reported that tTG could interact with several members of the integrin family, including α5β1 (as we also report in the current study), but also α1β1, α3β1, αvβ3 and αIIbβ3 (32Akimov S, A. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the report by Akimov et al. demonstrated that the related transglutaminase family member, FXIII, was not a ligand for α5β1, and thus suggested that the interactions between integrins and transglutaminases was specific for tTG. Although that report and this one both described interactions between α5β1 and tTG, there were several substantial differences. For example, Akimov et al. found no effect of either GRGDSP peptide or anti-β1 antibody on the interaction between tTG and integrins they describe, whereas in this report we found that GRGDSP completely eliminated the residual adhesion of G-361 cells to tTG once α9β1-mediated adhesion was inhibited, and we also found complete inhibition with anti-β1 antibody. Furthermore, we found no role for integrins other than α4β1, α5β1, or α9β1 in the adhesion of MOLT-3 or G-361 cells to tTG. We have checked the expression of various integrin subunits other than those shown in Fig. 2. As is clearly depicted in Fig. 10, G-361 cells also expressed α2, α3, α6, and αvβ3. MOLT-3 cells, however, did not express these integrins substantially. Results obtained with G-361 cells further substantiate the notion that these integrins are not involved in the adhesion of G-361 cells to tTG. There are several possible explanations for these differences. One obvious difference is that Akimov et al. were examining the effects of tTG on cell adhesion to the 42-kDa fragment of fibronectin, and in their case the tTG was supplied to integrins within the secretory apparatus of the same cell, whereas the present study examined adhesion to immobilized tTG. Under the conditions examined by Akimov et al., it is conceivable that blocking antibodies and GRGDSP peptide would not be able to displace already bound tTG, whereas these reagents were perfectly capable of binding to unligated integrin under the conditions used in the present study, thereby blocking subsequent interactions with tTG. Such an explanation is plausible because it is often more difficult to detach already adherent cells with integrin-blocking reagents than to block the attachment of suspended cells. Alternatively, the WI-38 cells and HEL cells used by Akimov et al. and the MOLT-3 cells and G-361 cells used in the present study could interact with tTG through different mechanisms.The results of the present study also clearly demonstrate that although α5β1 is not a receptor for inactive FXIII, both α4β1 and α9β1 are. These findings appear to differ from our previous report suggesting that α5β1 did contribute to adhesion of TIG-1 cells to FXIII. However, the adhesion observed in those experiments required that the FXIII be activated. The results of the present study confirm that α5β1 on G-361 cells can also mediate adhesion to activated FXIII (data not shown). We are uncertain whether the requirement for activation in this case is due to a conformational change in FXIII upon activation that unmasks an α5β1 binding site or to a requirement for enzymatic activity to induce α5β1-mediated adhesionThe interaction of α4β1 and α9β1 with FXIII could be biologically significant. Both α4β1 and α9β1 are highly expressed on specific populations of leukocytes, where they play a prominent role in transendothelial leukocyte migration. As a member of the coagulation cascade, FXIII is likely to be enriched at sites of vascular injury and inflammation, where its interaction with α4β1 and α9β1could promote leukocyte extravasation.We speculated previously about the function of pp-vWF as an emergency tag for targeting of α4β1-expressing leukocytes, together with VCAM-1, to sites of inflammation and injury (24Isobe T.

https://openalex.org/W1985538285,"The acidocalcisome is an acidic calcium store in trypanosomatids with a vacuolar-type proton-pumping pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase) located in its membrane. In this paper, we describe a new method using iodixanol density gradients for purification of the acidocalcisome from Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. Pyrophosphatase assays indicated that the isolated organelle was at least 60-fold purified compared with the large organelle (10,000 × g) fraction. Assays for other organelles generally indicated no enrichment in the acidocalcisome fraction; glycosomes were concentrated 5-fold. Vanadate-sensitive ATP-driven Ca2+ uptake (Ca2+-ATPase) activity was detectable in the isolated acidocalcisome, but ionophore experiments indicated that it was not acidic. However, when pyrophosphate was added, the organelle acidified, and the rate of Ca2+ uptake increased. Use of the indicator Oxonol VI showed that V-H+-PPase activity generated a membrane potential. Use of sulfate or nitrate in place of chloride in the assay buffer did not affect V-H+-PPase activity, but there was less activity with gluconate. Organelle acidification was countered by the chloride/proton symport cycloprogidiosin. No vacuolar H+-ATPase activity was detectable in isolated acidocalcisomes. However, immunoblots showed the presence of at least a membrane-bound V-H+-ATPase subunit, while experiments employing permeabilized epimastigotes suggested that vacuolar H+-ATPase and V-H+-PPase activities are present in the same Ca2+-containing compartment.

Advances are being made in parts of South America in blocking transmission from insect vectors or blood transfusion (1World Health OrganizationThirteenth Programme Report , UNDP/World Bank/World Health Organization Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. World Health Organization, Geneva1997: 112-123Google Scholar), but more effective chemotherapy is needed for the millions who are already infected. This is especially true for treatment of the long term chronic phase of the disease (2Docampo R. Schmuñis G.A. Parasitol.

The rational development of new drugs depends on the identification of differences between human metabolism and that of the causative parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. An unusual feature of T. cruzi, in comparison with mammalian cells, is the storage of calcium in acidic organelles, which we termed acidocalcisomes (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Initially identified in permeabilized cells (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem.

However, despite being analyzed in situ, especially by x-ray dispersion microanalysis (5Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol.

Our results to date have already produced a novel finding, namely that the acidocalcisome possesses vacuolar-type proton-pumping pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase)1activity (6Scott D.A. de Souza W.

Until recently, this activity had been definitively shown to be present only in the vacuoles and plasma membranes of plants (11Rea P.A. Poole R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 157-180Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar,12Ratajczak R. Hinz G. Robinson D.G.

Schultz A. Baltscheffsky H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). V-H+-PPases have now been found in other bacteria and an archaeon (14Drozdowicz Y.M. Lu Y.-P. Patel V. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Rea P.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated activity in other trypanosomatids (15Rodrigues C.O.

Acta. 1992; 1104: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), their presence in animals is undocumented. We have recently cloned, sequenced, and expressed the V-H+-PPase gene from T. cruzi. 3J. E. Hill, D. A. Scott, S. Luo, and R. Docampo, submitted for publication. The purpose of the present work was to further characterize the isolated T. cruzi acidocalcisome, particularly with respect to features that had been attributed to this compartment in permeabilized cell experiments. We examined ATP-driven Ca2+uptake and, by the use of ionophores, tested whether Ca2+was accumulated into an acidic environment, as found in digitonin-permeabilized T. cruzi (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We checked for the establishment of a membrane potential in the acidocalcisome by the action of the V-H+-PPase and the effect of different anions and the chloride/proton symport cycloprogidiosin (CPG; Ref. 19Maeshima M. Nakayasu T. Kawauchi K. Hirata H. Shimmen T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1999; 40: 439-442Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) on proton uptake. We searched for the presence of Na+/H+ exchange activity, which we had previously found in acidocalcisome fractions from Trypanosoma brucei (16Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we looked for the presence of H+-ATPases in the acidocalcisome, since our initial work implicated a vacuolar-type H+-ATPase in the acidification of this organelle (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and we have also before found evidence for the presence of a P-type H+-ATPase in internal membranes of T. cruzi (20Scott D.A. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The present work was facilitated by the use of a new isolation procedure, in which Percoll was replaced as the density gradient substrate by iodixanol. Leupeptin,trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, ATP, Oxonol VI, arsenazo III, ionophores except ionomycin, and reagents for marker enzyme assays were purchased from Sigma. Silicon carbide (400 mesh) was bought from Aldrich. Bafilomycin A1 was purchased from Kamiya Biomedical (Thousand Oaks, CA). 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and ionomycin (free acid) were from Calbiochem.

CPG (19Maeshima M. Nakayasu T. Kawauchi K. Hirata H. Shimmen T.

Mouse monoclonal antibody N2 against Dictyostelium V-H+-ATPase 100-kDa subunit was bought from the Monoclonal Antibody Center of the University of Hawaii. A rabbit antiserum was raised against a recombinant nonconserved portion of a cloned T. cruzi P-type H+-ATPase and affinity-purified. 4S. Luo, W. Yan, H.-G. Lu, and R.

EnzChek phosphate assay kit was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit was bought from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other reagents were analytical grade. Epimastigotes (∼2 × 1010) of the Y strain of T. cruzi were grown as described previously (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), collected by centrifugation, and washed twice in Dulbecco's PBS and once in lysis buffer (125 mmsucrose, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm K-Hepes, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, and 10 μm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, pH 7.2). The cell pellet was mixed with 1.5× wet weight silicon carbide and lysed by grinding with a pestle and mortar for 60 s. The lysate was clarified first by centrifugation at 144 × g for 5 min and then 325 × g for 10 min. The second pellet was washed under the same conditions, and the supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,500 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer with the aid of a 22-gauge needle and applied to a discontinuous gradient of iodixanol, with 4-ml steps of 24, 28, 34, 37, and 40% iodixanol, diluted in lysis buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 × g in a Beckman SW 28 rotor for 60 min. The acidocalcisome fraction pelleted on the bottom of the tube and was resuspended in lysis buffer. Pyrophosphate-driven H+ uptake into acidocalcisomes was assayed using acridine orange as described before (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), except that the standard buffer used was 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm K-Hepes, 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.2. In assays for H+-ATPase activity, pyrophosphate (0.1 mm) was replaced by ATP (1 mm). In the alternate buffers used, the chloride salts were replaced with sulfates, nitrates, or gluconates. The membrane potential induced in acidocalcisomes by H+-PPase activity was monitored using Oxonol VI (16Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the same buffer used for the assay of H+ transport. The uptake of Ca2+ into organelles within digitonin-permeabilized epimastigotes was assayed using the Ca2+ binding dye arsenazo III. A previous assay method (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was used, except that EGTA and calcium chloride were not added to the assay mixture; the only free Ca2+ in the assay came from the cells or was contaminant in the buffer used (typically 3–11 μm). Oligomycin and antimycin A were also omitted from the assay buffer, since there was no evidence of mitochondrial uptake under these conditions. Experiments with isolated acidocalcisomes were performed in the same manner, except that whole cells were replaced by the purified fraction, and digitonin was omitted. PPase was assayed by measuring released phosphate using the EnzChek phosphate assay kit as described before (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with the microtiter plate modification (16Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensitivity of this method to phosphate was calibrated in the different buffers used. Hexokinase (glycososomal marker) and α-mannosidase (lysosome) were assayed as before (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, which have dual mitochondrial/cytosolic locations in T. cruzi (23Duschak V.G. Cazzulo J.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 83: 131-136Google Scholar), were assayed by a modification of a previous method (24Segel H.L. Matsuzawa T. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 153-159Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For alanine aminotransferase, a 0.1-ml mixture of 50 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.2, 4 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 10 mml-alanine, 2 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 0.2 mm NADH was added to sample in a microtiter well, and the activity was recorded at 340 nm and 30 °C in a PowerWave 340i plate reader (Bio-tek Instruments). For aspartate aminotransferase, the same method was used, with the substitution (at the same concentrations) of l-aspartate for alanine and malate dehydrogenase for lactate dehydrogenase. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, using 4–15% Ready Gels (Bio-Rad), and blotted onto nitrocellulose (NitroPure, MSI, Westborough, MA) with a Bio-Rad Mini Transblot apparatus by standard techniques. Subsequent processing steps were done in Dulbecco's PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk, washed three times, and incubated with primary antibody, diluted as per the Fig. 2 legend, for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then washed three times, incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) or anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) as appropriate, washed three times, and processed for chemiluminescence detection as per the manufacturer's (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) instructions. Photographic exposures of 10 s to 4 min were made. Molecular weights were calculated using prestained molecular weight markers. Before reprobing with other antibodies, blots were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, washed three times in PBS/Tween 20, and reblocked as above. Spot intensity was measured with an Alpha Imager 2000 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). CPG (100 nm) was added to T. cruzi epimastigotes resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS at 4 × 107 cells/ml and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in PBS before observation with an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope fitted with a red emission filter. Digital images were recorded as described before (25Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron microscopy of acidocalcisome fractions dried onto sample grids or fixed and sectioned was done as before (5Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol.

The utility of the method described here for the purification of acidocalcisomes was assessed by assaying marker enzymes and comparing the activities in the large organelle fraction applied to the iodixanol gradient and the acidocalcisome fraction from the base of the gradient (TableI). Pyrophosphatase was assessed as the pyrophosphate hydrolytic activity sensitive to the specific V-H+-PPase inhibitor AMDP (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J.

This may actually be a large underestimate of the degree of purification of the acidocalcisome, since the H+-PPase, although a marker for the acidocalcisome, also appears to be located on the cell surface (6Scott D.A. de Souza W.

The only other organelle that was purified to any extent in the acidocalcisome preparation was the glycosome, evidenced by a 5-fold purification of hexokinase.

Instead, we assayed alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, which are, respectively, 60% cytosolic/40% mitochondrial, and 10% cytosolic/90% mitochondrial (23Duschak V.G. Cazzulo J.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 83: 131-136Google Scholar). Neither of these activities was purified in the acidocalcisome fraction. The acidocalcisome was therefore enriched at least 10-fold more than these other cell compartments by this technique.Table IPurification of acidocalcisomes on iodixanol step gradientsYieldPurification%-foldProtein0.16 (6)Pyrophosphatase (AMDP-sensitive)10.0 (6)1-aPyrophosphatase activity in acidocalcisome preparations 11.3 ± 2.3 μmol/min/mg of protein (average ± S.D.).62Hexokinase0.84 (6)5α-Mannosidase<0.11 (5)1-bActivity in acidocalcisome generally less than the detection limit, which was equivalent to 0.1% yield.<1Alanine aminotransferase0.18 (6)1Aspartate aminotransferase0.22 (4)1Yield values are percentages relative to the 10,000 ×g pellet fraction and represent averages from the number of preparations in parentheses.1-a Pyrophosphatase activity in acidocalcisome preparations 11.3 ± 2.3 μmol/min/mg of protein (average ± S.D.).1-b Activity in acidocalcisome generally less than the detection limit, which was equivalent to 0.1% yield.

We assessed the acidocalcisome fraction for the presence of different H+pumps using antibodies. First, we used an antiserum raised against a peptide, 15 amino acids in length, from the ArabidopsisH+-PPase, which we previously found to recognize the T. cruzi H+-PPase (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The corresponding peptide is present in the T. cruzi sequence with only a single conservative substitution.3 As expected, the antiserum detected a band of the appropriate size in the acidocalcisome, even when as little as 0.3 μg of protein was loaded onto the gel, but the H+-PPase was not detected in 3 μg of the 10,000 ×g fractions (Fig.2 A, top). The same blot was reprobed with an antiserum raised against a P-type H+-ATPase, which has been found to be mainly located on the cell surface of T. cruzi but is also present on some internal membranes4 (Fig. 2 A,bottom). The 10,000 × g pellet fraction gave a strong response, estimated by densitometry to be 3 times as strong as the response to the acidocalcisome fraction on an equivalent protein basis. In other words, the purification between these fractions of this H+-ATPase was <1×. This indicates that the acidocalcisome fraction was not enriched in plasma membrane. Work with permeabilized T. cruzi had previously suggested the presence of a vacuolar H+-ATPase in acidocalcisomes (4Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal antibody (N2), raised against the 100-kDa subunit of Dictyostelium vacuolar H+-ATPase (26Fok A.K. Clarke M. Ma L. Allen R.D. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), had proven to be immunoreactive against vacuoles in T. cruzi(25Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that this antibody recognized a band slightly larger than the expected molecular weight in isolated acidocalcisomes (Fig.2 B), but only when a large amount of sample (13 μg of protein) was loaded. Comparison with varied amounts of the 10,000 × g pellet fraction on the blot indicated that this band was less than 4-fold purified in the acidocalcisome. H+-PPase activity was detectable in the purified acidocalcisome fraction using acridine orange (Fig.3). In this assay, the weak base acridine orange accumulates and dimerizes in vesicles as they acidify, leading to changes in its spectral properties (27Palmgren M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Vesicle acidification induced by pyrophosphate may be measured as the decrease in absorbance at 493–530 nm (6Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Activity varied between 0.014 and 0.095 absorbance units/min/μg of protein in the standard assay (nine preparations). Replacement of chloride in the buffer by sulfate or nitrate did not affect the activity, whereas gluconate led to lower proton uptake rates (Fig. 3). In experiments with different preparations, sulfate gave 94 ± 3% of the initial rate with chloride (n = 3 experiments), nitrate gave 98 ± 10% of the chloride rate (n = 4), and gluconate gave 61 ± 20% of the chloride rate (n = 5). These anion effects were also tested in pyrophosphate hydrolysis (phosphate detection) assays. These assays included the proton ionophore nigericin to dissipate proton or membrane potential gradients across the acidocalcisome membrane. Here, the respective activities in the different buffers in comparison with the chloride buffer were as follows: sulfate, 95 ± 41%; nitrate, 107 ± 10%; gluconate, 89 ± 11% (n = 3 in all cases; the excessive variation in the activity with sulfate was due to the phosphate assay system being much less sensitive in the presence of sulfate). These results suggest that there is a requirement for anion transport to balance H+ uptake during H+-PPase activity and that chloride, sulfate, or nitrate can fulfill this requirement, but gluconate is transported less efficiently, if at all. Using the above assay conditions (chloride buffer), but with replacement of acridine orange by Oxonol VI, it was possible to detect a membrane potential (ΔΨ) following pyrophosphate addition (Fig.4). The sharp rise in absorbance (A 630–A 596) upon pyrophosphate addition indicated the establishment of an inside-positive membrane potential (28Waggoner A.S. Gunn R. Parker J.L. Cell Physiology of Blood. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1988: 211-215Google Scholar). This slowly drifted down over the following several minutes (Fig. 4, trace a).

Here we show that NEST, a recombinant polypeptide expressed in Escherichia coli, reacts with an ester substrate and covalent inhibitors in a manner very similar to NTE. NEST comprises residues 727–1216 of human NTE, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that serine 966 and two aspartate residues, Asp1086 and Asp960, are critical for catalysis. The results of mutating the 11 histidines in NEST suggest that NTE does not use a conventional catalytic triad. By reacting NEST with [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate, Ser966 was confirmed as the active-site serine, and evidence was obtained that an isopropyl group is transferred from the Ser966 adduct to an aspartate residue. Detergent was required both for solubilization of NEST from lysates of E. coli and during purification procedures. Catalytic activity was lost in detergent extracts, but was restored when purified NEST was incorporated into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes. Hydropathy analysis did not indicate the presence of membrane-spanning segments within the NEST sequence. However, biochemical evidence including detergent-phase separation experiments and the resistance of liposome-incorporated NEST to proteolysis indicated that, unlike most eukaryotic serine hydrolases, the catalytic domain of NTE has integral membrane protein properties.

The active-site nucleophilic serine residue of these enzymes attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the substrate, forming a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate, which is subsequently hydrolyzed (1Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). A consequence of this reaction mechanism is that serine hydrolases are susceptible to covalent inhibition by organophosphorus esters (OPs)1 with which they form an analogous phosphyl-enzyme intermediate. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) has for many years been widely used in biochemical studies of serine hydrolases, and newer OPs have been proposed as agents for activity-based profiling of this class of enzymes (2Liu Y. Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14694-14699Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In man and some other vertebrates, DFP and certain other OPs cause degeneration of long axons in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. The primary target for these OPs is neuropathy target esterase (NTE), an integral membrane protein in vertebrate neurons. The physiological substrate of NTE is unknown, but it is detected in vitro by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phenyl valerate (3Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in OP-induced neuropathy is of fundamental interest since it may yield information about normal axon maintenance. DFP and other neuropathic OPs react covalently with the active-site serine residue of NTE, thereby inhibiting its esterase activity (see Scheme FS1). Subsequently, a rapid intramolecular rearrangement, termed aging, leaves a negatively charged monoisopropyl phosphate species covalently attached to the serine. The aged enzyme, unlike the simple inhibited enzyme, cannot be reactivated by nucleophilic reagents such as oximes (see Scheme FS1). The aging reaction in DFP-inhibited NTE differs from that in better characterized serine hydrolases such as acetylcholinesterase: it is considerably faster, and in an intramolecular transfer, one of the isopropyl groups forms a covalent adduct with another amino acid residue of NTE called site Z (see SchemeFS1) (4Clothier B. Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Johnson M.K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 102: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Much evidence indicates that aging of NTE is the essential primary event in the initiation of OP neuropathy (5Johnson M.K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1990; 102: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning and sequencing have revealed that NTE is unrelated to known serine hydrolases, but belongs to a novel protein family represented in species from bacteria to man (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TheDrosophila NTE homologue, the Swiss Cheese protein (SWS), is involved in neural development, and sws mutant flies show age-dependent neurodegeneration (7Kretzschmar D. Hasan G. Sharma S. Heisenberg M. Benzer S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7425-7432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether a genetic human neurological condition results from mutation of the NTE gene (on chromosome 19p13.3 (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)) remains to be determined. However, in contrast to the recessive genetic disorder in sws mutant flies, OP-induced neuropathy in adult vertebrates does not appear to result from a loss of the normal enzymatic activity of NTE, but instead may represent a toxic gain of function in the modified protein (3Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, to begin to elucidate the molecular basis for the unusual properties of NTE, we expressed portions of recombinant NTE inEscherichia coli to define both the minimal domain and some of the individual residues required for catalytic activity and reaction with OPs. The E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain and pET21b vector were purchased from Novagen. Pfu polymerase and the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit were supplied by Stratagene. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was purchased from QIAGEN Inc. [1,3-3H]DFP ([3H]DFP; 310 Bq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products, and 2-isonitrosoacetophenone was from Aldrich. Phenyl saligenin phosphate and mipafox were supplied by Oryza Labs. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or synthesized in this laboratory as described previously (8Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 9Meredith C. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using Pfu polymerase and the NTE cDNA clone D16 as a template (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to amino acids 727–1216, 733–1216, 754–1216, and 733–1166 were subcloned into the pET21b vector, and DNA sequences of all were verified. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit. Seventeen residues within construct 727–1216 were mutated, and all mutations were checked by DNA sequencing. All constructs in the pET21b vector were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. All recombinant polypeptides had an N-terminal 10-amino acid T7 tag to allow immunochemical detection and a C-terminal His6tag for affinity purification. Cultures were grown at 37 °C, and after 4–5 h of induction with 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were freeze-thawed and resuspended in TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Cell lysates were then analyzed either for solubility of the recombinant polypeptides (see Fig. 1 b) or for NTE-like esterase activity (see below). Cells transformed with the construct containing amino acids 727–1216, called NEST (for NTEesterase domain), were cultured on a large scale for protein purification. Freeze-thawed cell pellets were extracted (90 min, 4 °C) in Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 2% CHAPS and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was adsorbed onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and eluted with Buffer A containing 0.3% CHAPS and 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was concentrated 30-fold and run on a 300SW gel filtration column (Nihon Waters Ltd.) equilibrated in Buffer A containing 0.3% CHAPS. Fractions containing NEST were identified by Western blot analysis with an antibody to the T7 tag and were then pooled, mixed with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC; 3:1 (w/w) lipid/protein ratio), and dialyzed at room temperature for 2 days against Buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The resulting NEST-containing liposomes were centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min to remove any precipitate and assayed for NTE-like activity (see below). The catalytic activity of the NEST/DOPC preparations was somewhat labile; thus, dialysis at room temperature for 3 days resulted in preparations with specific activities 10-fold lower than those dialyzed for 2 days. NTE-like activity was assayed as the paraoxon-resistant and mipafox-sensitive hydrolysis of phenyl valerate (8Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To compare the enzymatic character of NEST in E. coli lysates with that of native NTE, bacterial lysates and chicken brain microsomes (isolated as described previously (10Glynn P. Read D.J. Guo R. Wylie S. Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 160 μm paraoxon. The reaction was stopped by dilution with TE buffer and centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). Aliquots of the pellets, resuspended in TE buffer, were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in the absence or presence of 50 μm mipafox or a range of concentrations of one of the five inhibitors described in Table I. Subsequently, phenyl valerate was added, and the samples were incubated for a further 20 min at 37 °C, after which the NTE-like esterase activity was determined from colorimetric assay of the phenol formed (8Johnson M.K. Arch. Toxicol. 1977; 37: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). For purified NEST-containing liposomes, the differential paraoxon and mipafox assay was not necessary, and activity was determined simply as phenyl valerate hydrolyzed in 20 min at 37 °C. Oxime reactivation experiments followed a previously described procedure (9Meredith C. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Paraoxon-treated samples of NEST-containing bacterial particulate fractions or chicken brain microsomes were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with either DFP or phenyl dipentylphosphinate (5 μmeach) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to remove excess OP. Pellets were resuspended in TE buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the absence or presence of the oxime 2-isonitrosoacetophenone (25 mm). Samples were recentrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in TE buffer before assaying for NTE-like activity.Table II50 values for covalent inhibitors of NTE and NESTInhibitorI50NTENESTmPhenyl saligenin phosphate(2.9 ± 0.3) × 10−9(3.5 ± 0.3) × 10−9Phenyl dipentylphosphinate(1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−7(2.7 ± 0.2) × 10−7Diisopropyl fluorophosphate(5.6 ± 0.6) × 10−7(9.6 ± 0.1) × 10−7Mipafox(6.1 ± 0.2) × 10−6(8.7 ± 0.2) × 10−6Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride(5.5 ± 0.5) × 10−5(1.5 ± 0.4) × 10−4I50 values are those concentrations of each inhibitor producing 50% inhibition of NTE-like esterase activity during a 20-min preincubation at 37 °C with either NTE in brain microsomes or NEST in bacterial lysates (see “Experimental Procedures” for details).

These followed procedures previously described (11Meredith C. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1248-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Paraoxon-treated samples of chicken brain microsomes and NEST-containing bacterial particulate fractions or NEST-containing liposomes were incubated in TE buffer with 4.6 μm [3H]DFP at 37 °C for 60 min. Preliminary experiments revealed that, under these conditions, reaction with [3H]DFP was complete by 20–40 min, by which time phenyl-valerate hydrolase activity was >95% inhibited. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling (5 min); samples were then run on 7.5% (for native NTE) and 12.5% (for NEST) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Pieces of gel containing the 155- and 55-kDa polypeptides (NTE and NEST, respectively) were excised and agitated in 1.0 ml of 0.5 m NaOH overnight at room temperature to liberate protein-bound tritium. To determine the amount of [3H]isopropyl group adducted with site Z (see Table II), equal aliquots of the NaOH eluate were counted, either directly (total) or after overnight freeze-drying to remove [3H]isopropyl alcohol (volatilizable). Catalytic center activity was determined as the ratio of phenyl valerate hydrolyzed per min to [3H]DFP covalently bound (11Meredith C. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1248-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Table IICatalytic center activities and OP aging reactions in NTE and NESTPreparationCatalytic centerOxime reactivationSite Z-associated tritium×10−5/min%%NTE in brain microsomes1.56 ± 0.0475.1 ± 9.730.7 ± 9.1NEST in E. colilysates1.87 ± 0.5687.0 ± 12.429.9 ± 4.8NEST/DOPC liposomes1.24 ± 0.28ND31.8 ± 7.2Catalytic center activities were determined as the ratio of phenyl valerate hydrolysed to the amount of [3H]DFP adducted by equal amounts of enzyme.

To determine the locations of the active-site serine and site Z, NEST-containing liposomes were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with [3H]DFP (4.6 μm) and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove excess DFP. Liposomes were resuspended in TE buffer, 0.1% SDS, and 2 mmdithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Endoproteinase Glu-C was added at a NEST/Glu-C ratio of 10:1 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the digest was fractionated on a 15% Tricine gel. Total and volatile fractions of protein-bound tritium were determined for individual polypeptide fragments in excised gel pieces as described above. The N-terminal sequences of individual fragments were determined by Edman degradation after blotting onto an Immobilon membrane (see Fig. 3). To determine the individual residues labeled with tritium, aliquots from each cycle of Edman degradation were subjected to scintillation counting. Phase partitioning was done essentially as described (12Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equal volume of 2% Triton X-114 (in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) was added to NEST-containing liposomes and incubated at (4 °C for 60 min before centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was layered onto buffered 6% sucrose, warmed to 30 °C for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min. The aqueous layer was removed and received 0.5% fresh Triton X-114. The mixture was overlaid onto the sucrose cushion used previously, incubated at 30 °C, and centrifuged. At the end of the separation, the aqueous layer was removed and rinsed with 2% Triton X-114. Both layers were diluted to give equal volumes and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (see Fig. 5). For proteinase K treatment, NEST-containing liposomes were diluted 4-fold in Buffer A, in Buffer A containing 1% CHAPS, or in Buffer A containing 1% CHAPS and 1% SDS. Proteinase K was then added to give a NEST/proteinase K ratio of 35:1 (w/w), and samples were incubated at 4 °C. Aliquots were removed at 20, 60, and 210 min after addition of proteinase K and added to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm final concentration). After a further 5 min, SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the mixtures were boiled and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Translation of human NTE cDNA clone D16 indicates a 1327-amino acid polypeptide; the putative active-site serine residue lies in a C-terminal region, well conserved between proteins in a novel family (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although standard hydropathy plots of the NTE sequence predict only a single transmembrane segment (TM) near the N terminus, analysis by the Tmpred program (13Hofmann K. Stofel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 34: 166Google Scholar) predicted four potential membrane-spanning segments (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The homology within the NTE protein family and the position of the predicted TMs informed our design of recombinant NTE constructs to obtain a polypeptide with esterase activity (Fig.1 a). The NTE cDNA clone D16 (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was used as a template for polymerase chain reactions to generate constructs of varying length, which were cloned into the pET21b vector and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS. E. coli lysates containing a recombinant polypeptide corresponding to residues 727–1216 of human NTE showed potent esterase activity. This construct was called NEST and was used for most of the subsequent experiments in this study. The approximate N-terminal limit of the NEST construct was suggested by our previous observation (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage of NTE generated a number of peptides initiated by Leu727, suggesting that this might lie in the area of a protein domain boundary. In addition, TM2, the second of the four putative transmembrane segments of NTE, begins at Leu733. A recombinant polypeptide corresponding to NTE residues 733–1216 was also catalytically active. By contrast, a recombinant polypeptide (NTE residues 754–1216) lacking putative TM2 had no detectable activity. The C-terminal boundary of NEST was not investigated in detail, but activity was not detected in a polypeptide corresponding to NTE residues 733–1166. Both catalytically active constructs could be extracted from E. coli lysates by the detergent CHAPS, but strongly denaturing conditions were required for the inactive polypeptides (Fig. 1 b). Recombinant NEST in bacterial lysates and native NTE in brain microsomes showed the same rank order to covalent inhibition by a series of five compounds. I50 values ranged over >4 orders of magnitude, with the neuropathic OP phenyl saligenin phosphate (I50 values in the low nanomolar range) being the most potent and the non-neuropathic phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (I50 ∼ 100 μm) the least. Throughout, NEST was marginally less sensitive (1.5–2.5-fold) to these inhibitors than native NTE (Table I). Recombinant NEST, both as a component of crude bacterial lysates and as a purified protein incorporated into DOPC liposomes, had catalytic center turnover numbers similar to those of native NTE in brain microsomes (Table II). Following inhibition by the non-neuropathic OP phenyl dipentylphosphinate (which cannot undergo the aging reaction) (SchemeFS1), treatment of NEST in bacterial lysates and of NTE in brain microsomes with an oxime allowed reactivation of most of the esterase activity (Table II). By contrast, neither preparation could be reactivated after inhibition by the neuropathic OP DFP, indicating that aging had occurred (cf.Scheme FS1). The OP aging reaction of DFP-inhibited NTE is rapid (t12 of a few minutes) and does not result in quantitative liberation of an isopropyl group into free solution, as occurs with DFP-inhibited acetylcholinesterase; instead, this group is transferred to a second site within NTE called site Z (Scheme FS1). The isopropyl groups attached to the active-site serine and site Z in aged, [3H]DFP-inhibited NTE can be distinguished because alkaline hydrolysis liberates non-volatilizable ([3H]monoisopropyl phosphate) and volatilizable ([3H]isopropyl alcohol) radioactive fractions, respectively (4Clothier B. Johnson M.K. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Meredith C. Johnson M.K. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1248-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this study, following aging in [3H]DFP-labeled preparations, ∼30% of the radioactivity associated with native NTE or NEST was found to be bound to site Z (Table II). Within the family of proteins related to NTE, we previously noted a core 200-residue region containing not only the putative active-site serine (Ser966), but also histidine, aspartate, and glutamate residues conserved even in a homologous protein in E. coli (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We suggested that Ser966 in combination with a conserved histidine and acidic residue could compose a catalytic triad as found in most serine hydrolases (6Lush M.J. Li Y. Read D.J. Willis A.C. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis of NEST to change these residues (Ser to Ala, His to Ala, Asp to Asn, and Glu to Gln) (Fig. 2). Aliquots of bacterial lysates containing equal amounts of the recombinant mutant polypeptides (as determined by Western blotting) were assayed for phenylvalerate hydrolase activity and reactivity with [3H]DFP. The latter values were used to normalize more accurately esterase activities for mutants showing insignificant or minor changes (Table III). Phenyl valerate is used in standard NTE assays at a concentration of 1.4 mm, and its K m has been estimated to be ∼10 mm (14Johnson M.K. Rev. Biochem. Toxicol. 1982; 4: 141-212Google Scholar). This relatively high K mand the limited solubility of phenyl valerate preclude accurate kinetic analysis, and so esterase activities for the various mutant enzymes are expressed relative to the value for wild-type NEST (100%).Table IIIEffects of site-directed mutagenesis on phenyl-valerate hydrolase activity of NESTMutationActivity (% of wild-type)Insignificant/minor D1033N95.8 ± 18.5 D1044N102.8 ± 2.4 E1032Q96.7 ± 20.3 D1004N14.3 ± 3.1 H945A75.9 ± 12.0 H1053A96.2 ± 9.7Severe S966A<0.001 D960N0.0085 ± 0.0018 D1086N0.0082 ± 0.0033 H860A0.067 ± 0.048 H885A0.29 ± 0.11Phenyl-valerate hydrolase activities of NEST mutants in bacterial lysates were assayed, and values for mutants with insignificant/minor changes in activity compared with wild-type NEST were normalized using the values determined for [3H]DFP reactivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the mean ± S.D. of three to four experiments. Open table in a new tab Phenyl-valerate hydrolase activities of NEST mutants in bacterial lysates were assayed, and values for mutants with insignificant/minor changes in activity compared with wild-type NEST were normalized using the values determined for [3H]DFP reactivity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are the mean ± S.D. of three to four experiments. As expected, mutation of Ser966 abolished the esterase activity of NEST. Mutation of either of two conserved aspartate residues, Asp960 or Asp1086, reduced activity 10,000-fold. By contrast, mutation of two other aspartates, Asp1033 and Asp1044, or of a conserved glutamate, Glu1032, had no apparent effect. On the other hand, the D1004N mutant had significantly (∼6-fold) lower esterase activity than wild-type NEST. Interestingly, the proportion (14.8 ± 4.5%, n = 3) of total tritium associated with site Z in the [3H]DFP-inhibited D1004N mutant was only about half that associated with site Z in wild-type NEST (cf.Table II). Within the core 200-residue region, mutation of two conserved histidines, His945 and His1053, had no effect on activity (Table III). Subsequently, all the remaining nine histidines in NEST (Fig. 2) were individually mutated to alanine, but only the H860A and H885A mutants showed substantially lowered (>300-fold) catalytic activity (Table III). However, although the H860A mutant showed <0.1% of the activity of wild-type NEST, it is unlikely that this histidine is directly involved in a catalytic triad; this is because a tyrosine residue is found in the corresponding position in SWS, the Drosophila NTE homologue (cf. Fig. 2), and we have shown that a portion of SWS, colinear with NEST, expressed in E. coli has substantial NTE-like esterase activity. 2P. Glynn and D. Kretzschmar, unpublished data. After [3H]DFP labeling, NEST-containing liposomes were denatured in SDS and treated with endoproteinase Glu-C. Fractionation of these digests on SDS-polyacrylamide gel resolved 12 polypeptide bands with molecular masses between 6 and 40 kDa (Fig.3 a). A combination of N-terminal sequencing of bands 6, 8, and 10 and predictions of the size of fragments generated by endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage of the NEST sequence allowed creation of a partial peptide map (Fig.3 b). The amounts of total and volatilizable radioactivities following NaOH treatment of excised polypeptide bands 6, 8, and 10 were determined. Very little tritium was associated with band 10, suggesting that both the active-site serine and site Z lie downstream of Ala955. By contrast, abundant tritium was associated with band 6, and as expected, a peak of radioactivity was liberated with Ser966 when band 6 was subjected to repeated cycles of Edman degradation (Fig.4 a). The proportion of volatilizable tritium (81%) in polypeptide band 8 was much greater than that in band 6 (28%), suggesting that the former polypeptide contains site Z. Edman degradation of band 8 liberated a peak of radioactivity coincident with Asp1044 (Fig.4 b). Surprisingly, however, the percentage of volatilizable counts in the D1044N mutant (27.0%, n = 2) was not significantly different from that in wild-type NEST, suggesting that in the absence of Asp1044, the transferred [3H]isopropyl group is adducted to another residue. NEST was firmly associated with particulate fractions of bacterial lysates and could be solubilized using CHAPS, but its catalytic activity was completely abolished. Purification of NEST was monitored by SDS-PAGE since, at all stages of the isolation in detergent, catalytic activity could not be detected. However, when purified NEST was incorporated into DOPC liposomes with removal of detergent by dialysis over a 2-day period, potently active preparations were obtained (see Table II). During isolation of NEST by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and gel filtration chromatography, detergent was required to maintain solubility and to prevent precipitation of the polypeptide.

It is subject to regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a variety of stimuli, including integrin engagement after attachment to extracellular matrix, oncogene activation, and growth factor stimulation. Here we use an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of the putative FAK autophosphorylation site, Tyr397. We demonstrate that FAK phosphorylation induced by integrins during focal adhesion assembly differs from that induced by activation of a temperature-sensitive v-Src, which is associated with focal adhesion turnover and transformation. Specifically, although v-Src induces tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, there is no detectable phosphorylation of Tyr397. Moreover, activation of v-Src results in a net decrease in fibronectin-stimulated phosphorylation of Tyr397, suggesting possible antagonism between v-Src and integrin-induced phosphorylation. Our mutational analysis further indicates that the binding of v-Src to Tyr397 of FAK in its phosphorylated form, which is normally mediated, at least in part, by the SH2 domain of Src, is not essential for v-Src-induced cell transformation. We conclude that different stimuli can induce phosphorylation of FAK on distinct tyrosine residues, linking specific phosphorylation events to ensuing biological responses.

It is widely expressed in most tissues, and at particularly high levels in neuronal tissue (1Andre E. Becker-Andre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Phosphorylation of FAK occurs in response to a wide variety of stimuli, including integrin engagement, oncogenic transformation, and growth factors or mitogenic neuropeptides (3Hanks S.K. Polte T.R.

Furthermore, an amino-terminal sequence that can bind the β1-integrin intracellular domain in vitro has been identified (8Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), and an association between β1-integrin and FAK has been demonstrated in human keratinocytes in vivo (9Danker K. Gabriel B. Heidrich C. Reutter W. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminus contains two proline-rich sequences that can bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins, such as p130cas or Graf (10Hildebrand J.D. Taylor J.M. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3169-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,11Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J.

Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 993-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition to these functional regulatory sequences, alternative splicing provides another mode of FAK regulation, with autonomous expression of the carboxyl-terminal portion of FAK (13Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), termed FRNK. However, while enforced overexpression of FRNK inhibits FAK-mediated cell spreading (14Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), its role as a physiological regulator of FAK function in vivo remains to be established. To date, six tyrosine phosphoacceptor sites in FAK have been identified, namely tyrosines 397, 407, 576, 577, 861, and 925 (15Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

Artificial integrin clustering induced by antibodies, or cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN), induce FAK phosphorylation (19Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 20Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar), with Tyr397 believed to be a site of autophosphorylation (21Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). FAK is also heavily tyrosine phosphorylated in Src-transformed cells (19Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), with sites other than Tyr397 also being phosphorylated (15Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell.

A model has been proposed whereby integrin-ligand binding triggers autophosphorylation of Tyr397, creating a high affinity binding site for the Src family kinases via their SH2 domains (7Hanks S.K.

The process of Src binding itself, which requires displacement of the intramolecular Src SH2 domain-Tyr527 interaction might contribute to Src activation (22MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2648-2656Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), enabling further phosphorylation of FAK on the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues, i.e.Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, Tyr861, and Tyr925, and activation of downstream signaling initiated by association of SH2 domain containing proteins, such as Grb2 (17Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar, 23Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (24Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Despite the model proposed above, the exact nature of the phosphoacceptor sites targeted by individual stimuli, the temporal sequence of events and how these are linked to cellular responses, is still unclear. To address this with respect to Tyr397 of FAK, we generated an antibody that specifically recognized the phosphorylated form of FAK-Tyr397. This was used to detect phosphorylation of Tyr397 after plating cells on fibronectin. In contrast, the Tyr397-phospho-specific antibody failed to react with FAK after activation of a ts v-Src mutant, although v-Src did induce phosphorylation of FAK on other tyrosine residues. In addition, a Tyr397 to Phe397 mutant of FAK (397F) was still tyrosine phosphorylated after v-Src activation, although direct association of the two proteins was ablated. Furthermore, vast overexpression of FAK-Y397F, which also inhibited the association of v-Src with endogenous FAK, did not affect the targeting of either v-Src or FAK to focal adhesions, v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on sites other than Tyr397, or cell transformation. Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum, 1% chick serum, and 10% tryptose phosphate broth, and were buffered with 5% CO2. For FN plating experiments, dishes were coated by preincubating overnight at 4 °C in a solution of 10 μg/ml FN (Stratatec) in PBS before being used for cell plating. The neomycin-selectable avian retrovirus, SFCV, constructs encoding temperature sensitive (ts)LA-29 v-Src (26Welham M.J. Wyke J.A. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1898-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or a kinase-defective variant of ts LA-29 that contains a Lys-Arg mutation at position 295, have been described previously (27Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Cells expressing ts v-Src mutants were grown either at restrictive temperature (41 °C), or were shifted to permissive temperature (35 °C) for the times indicated. Myc-tagged FAK was generated by ligating a double stranded oligonucleotide (sense strand, 5′-gatcagcgaacaaaaactcatctcagaagaggatctgaataa-3′; antisense strand, 5′-gatcttattcagatcctcttctgagatgagtttttgttcgct-3′) into the BclI site at position 3186. Y397F-FAK was produced by conventional polymerase chain reaction and cloning methods, and verified by sequencing. Both Myc-tagged variants were expressed in the replication competent retrovirus RCAS. For the generation of antibodies specific for the putative FAK autophosphorylation site, Tyr397, the following 17-amino acid peptide was synthesized SVSETDDpYAEIIDEED(C). This represents amino acids 390–405 of avian and human FAK (1Andre E. Becker-Andre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar) with tyrosine 397 being chemically phosphorylated. The carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue was added to facilitate coupling to a carrier protein, keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Peptides were estimated to be greater than 90% pure by high performance liquid chromatography, and composition was confirmed by amino acid analysis (synthesis and analysis of peptides was carried out by Affiniti Research Products Ltd., Exeter, United Kingdom). 200 μg of conjugated peptide (molar ratio (peptide, 40:1, keyhole limpet hemocyanin) was emulsified in Freund's adjuvant (Sigma), either complete for the primary immunization, or incomplete for subsequent immunizations, as described previously (28McLean G.W. Owsianka A.M. Subak-Sharpe J.H. Marsden H.S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 137: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Serum was checked for positive reactivity and IgG was purified by caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by affinity absorption, first to a Sepharose column containing the immunizing peptide in its unphosphorylated form (to remove non-phospho-specific antibodies). The column eluate was then absorbed to a Sepharose column containing the phosphopeptide, to affinity absorb phospho-specific IgG. Bound IgG was eluted under low pH conditions and subjected to dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). (The purification procedures described were carried out according to instructions provided to us by Affiniti Research Products Ltd.) Purified IgG, termed anti-397-P, was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C. For protein analysis, dishes of cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and either used immediately or quick frozen at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitations cell monolayers were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% sodium deoxycholate) with the inclusion of inhibitors (500 μm sodium fluoride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma)). Samples were sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 × g at 4 °C. 800–1000 μg of protein lysates (measured by Micro BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) were immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of anti-FAK rabbit polyclonal antiserum (29Fincham V.J. Chudleigh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2 μg of anti-Src mAb EC10 (UBI), or 2 μg of anti-Myc 9E10 mAb (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Complexes were collected by addition of a 50% (v/v) preparation of Sepharose beads coupled to Protein-A (Sigma) in RIPA buffer for a further 60 min at 4 °C, followed by 5 × washes with RIPA buffer and subsequent elution in sample buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 700 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) at 100 °C for 2 min. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and supernatants analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Marsden H.S. Stow N.D. Preston V.G. Timbury M.C. Wilkie N.M. J. Virol. 1978; 28: 624-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry blotting apparatus. Unoccupied binding sites were blocked with 5% dried milk powder in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) followed by probing with either anti-Tyr397 (anti-397-P) purified IgG (2 μg/ml) in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBST or general anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20; Transduction Laboratories) at 0.25 μg/ml or FAK monoclonal antibody at 0.5 μg/ml (clone 77, Transduction Laboratories). Detection was by incubation with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody or anti-Myc conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen) and visualization was by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed at 4 °C for 15 min with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated with 1:500 anti-Src EC10 (UBI), 2 μg/ml anti-Myc mAb (Jackson) or 2.5 μg/ml anti-paxillin mAb (Transduction Laboratories). Antibody detection was via fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and/or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson), for 45 min at room temperature. Actin stress fibers were visualized by staining with 10 μg/ml phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma) for 40 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was visualized using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope and images were printed on a dye sublimation printer (Kodak). In order to study stimulus-induced phosphorylation of the putative autophosphorylation site in FAK, i.e. Tyr397, we generated an antiserum which specifically recognized Tyr397 in its phosphorylated state. A 17-amino acid peptide encompassing residues 390–405 of FAK, with a phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 397 (Fig.1 A), was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via a carboxyl-terminal cysteine residue and used to immunize rabbits (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Antibodies present in the crude sera that recognized nonphosphorylated epitopes were removed by affinity absorption. Purified phospho-specific IgG was designated anti-397-P and tested for its ability to recognize FAK in lysates of CEF that had been plated onto FN for 60 min, conditions that promote autophosphorylation of FAK (21Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Anti-397-P reacted strongly with FAK at 125 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), as judged by co-migration with FAK immunoblotted with a commercial FAK-specific antibody (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). FAK specificity was supported by the lack of reactivity of anti-397-P with FAK extracted from CEF that had been in suspension for 60 min after trypsinization (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), conditions that induce rapid de-phosphorylation of FAK (15Calalb M.B.

Confirmation of the sequence and phosphorylation-specific reactivity of this antibody was obtained by blotting cell lysates with anti-397-P IgG which had been preincubated with excess immunizing peptide, either in the unphosphorylated (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2) or phosphorylated form (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). Preincubation with excess Tyr397-containing phosphopeptide inhibited FAK reactivity after plating cells on FN (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), while excess unphosphorylated peptide had no effect, indicating that purified anti-397-P IgG reacted specifically with the Tyr397-phosphorylated form of FAK. Although both FN attachment and v-Src activity stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, the biological outcome of these two stimuli is quite different. Specifically, integrin engagement mediated by FN attachment induces focal adhesion formation and cell spreading, while v-Src induces focal adhesion turnover and cell transformation. We therefore compared FAK-Tyr397phosphorylation induced by either plating cells on FN or by activating a ts v-Src mutant (ts-LA29 v-Src) in the absence of FN, which induces phosphorylation, and subsequent proteolysis, of FAK, events that are visibly linked to focal adhesion disruption during transformation (31Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, plating of cells on FN triggered a substantial increase in FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig.2, middle panel, lanes 2–4), which coincided with an increase in the phosphorylation of Tyr397 (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 2–4). However, although FAK was also tyrosine phosphorylated by activation of ts v-Src after shift to the permissive temperature (35 oC), as detected by a general phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2, middle panel, lanes 5–7), FAK-Tyr397failed to react with anti-397-P (Fig. 2, upper panel, lanes 5–7). This indicates that phosphorylation of FAK induced by v-Src can occur at phosphoacceptor sites that are distinct from Tyr397, although the latter is clearly phosphorylated after plating on FN. Since our results indicated that different phosphorylation sites in FAK might act as recipients for signals from FN or v-Src, we next examined phosphorylation after attachment to FN when v-Src was active. CEF expressing ts v-Src, or its kinase-defective variant (tsLA29-KD), were either retained in suspension after trypsinization (S), or plated onto FN for 60 min, either at the restrictive (41 °C) or permissive (35 °C) temperatures. After plating on FN, specific phosphorylation of Tyr397 occurred both at the permissive and the non-permissive temperatures and in cells expressing both kinase-active and kinase-defective v-Src (Fig.3 A, upper panel). However, we noted that ts v-Src activity at the permissive temperature was consistently associated with reduced phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397, when compared with cells plated on FN at restrictive temperature (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 4and 5). To investigate this further, adhesion to FN and activation of v-Src were stimulated sequentially, and phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 examined. Following adhesion to FN for 45 min, cells expressing ts v-Src were either switched to 35 °C for various times (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4–6), or were maintained at 41 °C (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–9). As expected, plating cells on FN following suspension caused a robust increase in phosphotyrosine content, which correlated with specific phosphorylation of Tyr397 (Fig. 3 B, upper and middle panels). However, following switch to the permissive temperature, there was a time-dependent decrease in the specific phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lanes 4–6). Furthermore, although there was also some decrease in phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 after 120 min at 41 °C (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9), indicating that phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 after plating on FN was transient, the net decrease was exacerbated and was evident by 60 and 90 min when v-Src was active at 35 °C (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lanes 4–6). Thus, v-Src-induced FAK phosphorylation is associated with reduced specific FAK-Tyr397 phosphorylation that is normally stimulated by attachment to FN, raising the possibility that v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK may antagonize integrin-induced phosphorylation. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-induced autophosphorylation of FAK on Tyr397 creates a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of c-Src, and mutation (Tyr to Phe) of this residue inhibits association (21Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 32Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the proposal of a model in which ECM-stimulated integrin clustering leads to accumulation of FAK at adhesion sites and autophosphorylation on Tyr397, facilitating the binding of c-Src, or other Src family members, via the Src SH2 domain. This binding would result in displacement of the autoregulatory, intramolecular Src-Tyr527-SH2 domain interaction, consequently activating Src kinase activity. Further phosphorylation of FAK on additional tyrosine phosphoacceptor sites by associated Src kinase is believed to create further potential binding sites for SH2-domain containing proteins, thus linking Src-induced FAK phosphorylation to downstream signaling pathways (33Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings that FAK-Tyr397 is not detectably phosphorylated after v-Src activation led us to investigate whether binding of v-Src to FAK, mediated by the Src SH2 domain and FAK-Tyr397 in its phosphorylated form, was essential for v-Src to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on other sites. To address this, we used CEF expressing ts v-Src which also overexpressed Myc-tagged FAK proteins, either wt FAK or FAK in which the Tyr at position 397 had been changed by mutagenesis to Phe (Y397F-FAK). We tested whether the Y397F mutation inhibited the association of v-Src with FAK, by carrying out anti-Src immunoprecipitations from wt- and Y397F-FAK-expressing cells and probing immunoblots with anti-Myc. As expected, although expressedwt FAK co-precipitated with v-Src (Fig.4 A, top panel, lane 1), an interaction that persisted after activation of v-Src by shift to the permissive temperature (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lanes 2 and 3), the Y397F-FAK mutant failed to co-precipitate with v-Src (Fig. 4 A, top panel, lanes 4–6). Thus, consistent with the findings of others on c-Src (21Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 32Eide B.L. Turck C.W. Escobedo J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2819-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), v-Src also requires FAK-Tyr397 for binding. In addition, re-probing of the immunoblots with an anti-FAK mAb failed to detect any substantial binding of endogenously expressed FAK to v-Src (Fig. 4 A, bottom panel, lanes 4–6). To determine whether v-Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK occurred in the absence of Tyr397 and formation of the v-Src·FAK complex, cells expressing the Myc-tagged FAK proteins were either maintained at 41 °C or shifted to 35 °C for 2 h. We detected an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of wt-FAK and to a lesser extent Y397F-FAK after activation of v-Src (Fig.4 B, top panel, lanes 2 and 4, respectively), indicating that binding of v-Src to FAK-Tyr397 was not essential for phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues within FAK. Additional confirmation of the specificity of the anti-397-P IgG was obtained by its failure to recognize Myc-tagged Y397F-FAK immunoprecipitated from these cells with anti-Myc (Fig. 4 B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 2). To test whether integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK on sites other than Tyr397 was dependent on prior phosphorylation of Tyr397, or the binding of FAK to Src family kinases, CEF overexpressing Myc-tagged wt- or Y397F-FAK were plated on FN, and tyrosine phosphorylation examined. We found that Y397F-FAK was tyrosine phosphorylated after plating of cells on FN (Fig. 4 C, upper panel, lane 2), although phosphorylation was considerably delayed when compared with wt-FAK (Fig. 4 C, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). Furthermore, this delayed integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Y397F-FAK was likely due to Src family kinase activity, since phosphorylation was impaired in the presence of a Src inhibitor, PD162531 (Fig. 4 C, upper panel, lanes 3 and 4), that we have previously shown to inhibit the activity of the Src family kinases in vitro and in vivo (34Owens D.W. McLean G.W. Wyke A.W. Paraskeva C. Parkinson E.K. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, as is the case with v-Src, formation of a complex between c-Src SH2 and FAK, or prior phosphorylation of Tyr397, is not absolutely required for Src-dependent phosphorylation of FAK on sites other than Tyr397, but may be necessary for optimal, rapid phosphorylation after integrin engagement. As the proposed model for FAK regulation suggested a critical role for phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397, and the consequent association with Src, during ECM-induced intracellular signaling, we examined whether vast overexpression of Y397F-FAK that blocks association with v-Src (Fig. 4 A), and also endogenous c-Src (not shown), influenced v-Src's biological activity. Specifically, v-Src activation in CEF is accompanied, at early times, by the assembly of new focal adhesions containing the oncoprotein (27Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 35Fincham V.J. Unlu M. Brunton V.G. Pitts J.D. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1551-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and subsequently, by tyrosine kinase-induced focal adhesion disruption as cells round up during transformation (27Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether mutation of Tyr397 of FAK to Phe397 influenced the intracellular targeting of ts v-Src to focal adhesions after switch to the permissive temperature, or subsequent focal adhesion disruption and transformation. The extent of overexpression of Myc-taggedwt- and Y397F-FAK, compared with endogenous FAK in vector-transfected controls, is shown (Fig.5 A, lanes 5–8). Double immunofluorescence with anti-Src and anti-Myc demonstrated that both exogenous FAK proteins were localized in focal adhesion structures, irrespective of v-Src activity (Fig. 5 B). In addition, v-Src was translocated from the perinuclear region of the cell to focal adhesions at the periphery after shift to the permissive temperature, even in the presence of overexpressed Y397F-FAK that prevented formation of a Src·FAK complex (Fig. 5 B, upper panels). These data indicate that both FAK and v-Src are targeted to focal adhesions under conditions where they are not associated. Moreover, overexpression of Y397F-FAK had no obvious consequences for focal adhesions formed at early times after activation of v-Src, as judged by visualization of focal adhesions containing the oncoprotein (Fig.5 B), and cells with focal adhesions containing Y397F-FAK remained spread. In addition, v-Src-induced morphological transformation that is associated with focal adhesion disruption (31Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar) was not impaired by vast overexpression of Y397F-FAK (Fig.5 C). Staining for actin stress fibers and the focal adhesion component paxillin, demonstrated that both cells expressingwt FAK and Y397F-FAK exhibited characteristic signs of the transformed phenotype when switched to 35 °C, with loss of actin stress fibers and disruption of paxillin containing focal adhesions associated with cell rounding (Fig. 5 C). Engagement of cell surface integrins with ECM, and transformation of cells with v-Src, results in increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation content, particularly in a subset of proteins between 115 and 130 kDa (20Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar, 36Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Much of this can be accounted for by FAK (6Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 7Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), which is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation following both adhesion to FN, or activation of an oncogenic variant of Src (19Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Furthermore, early experiments indicated that v-Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK was specifically associated with reduced gel migration, suggesting that Src- and integrin-dependent phosphorylation of FAK were either quantitatively or qualitatively different (19Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). This was later supported by phospho-peptide mapping, which demonstrated that FAK-Tyr397is phosphorylated following integrin engagement, with further phosphorylation of FAK on Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, Tyr861, and Tyr925 likely to be mediated by c-Src, or other members of the Src family (15Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,21Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Further experimentation led to a more refined model, in which cell spreading on ECM results in integrin-induced autophosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397, creating a binding site for the Src SH2 domain, leading to Src association and Src-mediated phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal Tyr residues mentioned above (33Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). However, this model is not necessarily relevant to activation of v-Src in adherent cells and subsequent transformation. In particular, the specific phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 in vivo after v-Src activation and its role in v-Src's biological activity remained unclear. By using an antibody that specifically recognized FAK-Tyr397 in its phosphorylated form (characterized in Fig. 1), we confirmed that attachment to FN induces phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 in vivo, but found that activation of a ts v-Src oncoprotein does not induce detectable phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397, although other sites in FAK were phosphorylated (Fig. 2). This indicates that different phosphorylation states of FAK are induced by integrin engagement and activated Src, and these correlate with the distinct biological outcomes of integrin-dependent adhesion assembly during cell spreading, and v-Src-induced adhesion disruption during cell transformation. Furthermore, v-Src activity leads to a net reduction in FAK-Tyr397 phosphorylation after attachment to FN (Fig. 3), suggesting that v-Src- and integrin-induced phosphorylation events are not only distinct, but may also be antagonistic. These findings are consistent with the idea that specific phosphorylation of FAK might act as a determinant of focal adhesion assembly or disassembly, mediated by downstream effector pathways that are engaged after stimulus-induced phosphorylation of particular tyrosine residues. If true, this implicates FAK as a pivotal switch in regulation of the cell-ECM adhesion assembly/disassembly cycle, with integrin-induced phosphorylation of Tyr397 stimulating assembly and Src-induced phosphorylation of one or more of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues stimulating disassembly. In support of this mode of regulation, unregulated v-Src alters the balance of cellular FAK phosphorylation in favor of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues at the expense of Tyr397 (Fig. 3), and the consequent biological outcome is uncontrolled focal adhesion disruption and transformation (31Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with the proposed role for specificity of FAK phosphorylation as a critical determinant of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly, there is abundant genetic evidence implicating FAK in both processes. Specifically, reduced FAK phosphorylation as a result of overexpression of FRNK, impairs the ability of cells to spread on FN (14Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), while fibroblasts derived from FAK −/− mice retain the ability to spread on FN, but are relatively non-motile as a result of impaired focal adhesions turnover (38Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings imply that in cells that express FAK, it normally has a role in regulating both the assembly and disassembly of cell-ECM adhesions. Our work has indicated that v-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is linked to focal adhesion disassembly during transformation and cell motility (27Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 31Fincham V.J. Wyke J.A. Frame M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2247-2252PubMed Google Scholar), and that v-Src's biological activity is independent of phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397 (Fig. 5). Recent work has shown that association of FAK with c-Src is associated with its redistribution from a diffuse cellular location to focal adhesions (39Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3489-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, our data presented here demonstrate that at least in the case of v-Src, FAK-Tyr397-dependent Src association is not necessary for focal adhesion localization. We find that vast overexpression of a Y397F-FAK mutant, which inhibits Src/FAK association, had no discernible effect on the assembly of focal adhesions containing the oncoprotein. However, the inside/out signaling that induces focal adhesion assembly early after v-Src activation may be mechanistically different to the outside/in signaling that leads to adhesion assembly induced after integrin engagement and during ECM-dependent cell motility. Furthermore, although the putative signaling pathway engaged as a consequence of FAK-Tyr397 phosphorylation, and responsible for integrin-induced focal adhesion assembly, is unclear, it is noteworthy that it is not only the Src family kinases that binds to phospho-Tyr397. Also binding via this site are the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (40Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Isoda H. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26329-26334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), which is required for FAK-dependent cell motility (41Reiske H.R. Kao S.C. Cary L.A. Guan J.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The increasing number of signaling proteins now shown to bind FAK in a Tyr397-dependent manner indicates that there is unlikely to be a single effector pathway activated as a result of integrin-induced phosphorylation at this site. Our results demonstrate that neither the FAK-Tyr397/Src-SH2 domain interaction, nor prior phosphorylation of FAK-Tyr397, is required for v-Src to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 4), or focal adhesion turnover that accompanies transformation (Fig. 5). However, although there is no absolute requirement, the kinetics of Src family kinase-dependent phosphorylation of FAK that occurs at later times after integrin engagement may be influenced by the state of FAK-Tyr397 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In conclusion, although the downstream consequences of individual FAK phosphorylation events are not fully understood, we have shown that integrin- and activated Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK are at least partly distinct, with only integrin engagement stimulating Tyr397 phosphorylation. The specific phosphorylation of FAK induced by these stimuli, together with their biological correlates, suggests that FAK phosphorylation may determine the balance of focal adhesion assembly and disassembly, and consequently the rate of integrin-dependent cell motility.

The role of κ-conotoxin PVIIA in prey capture has been established (1Terlau H. Shon K. Grilley M. Stocker M. Stühmer W. Olivera B.M. Nature. 1996; 381: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); this peptide is key to the very rapid immobilization of fish prey by C. purpurascens. This cone species uses the following two groups of toxins to affect different physiological programs in the prey after venom injection: a very rapid excitotoxic shock and a slower onset but irreversible neuromuscular block. κ-Conotoxin PVIIA plays a role in the initial excitotoxic shock response to venom injection; in combination with δ-conotoxin PVIA (which delays inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels), an immediate tetanic-like immobilization is elicited upon injection into fish. The voltage-gated potassium channel Shaker, cloned fromDrosophila melanogaster, is sensitive to κ-conotoxin PVIIA (1Terlau H. Shon K. Grilley M. Stocker M. Stühmer W. Olivera B.M. Nature. 1996; 381: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological characterization of the interaction of κ-PVIIA1 with chimeras between the Shaker channel and a κ-conotoxin-insensitive potassium channel from rat brain (Kv-1.1) demonstrated that the binding determinants on Shaker were in the pore region of the channel, presumably at the extracellular face (11Shon K. Stocker M. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Jacobsen R. Walker C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently, two different groups published structures for κ-PVIIA, determined on the basis of multidimensional NMR techniques (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 15: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); the structures were generally similar. However, the interpretation of likely mechanisms of the molecular orientation of κ-conotoxin PVIIA in the channel mouth suggested by the two groups, based on the structural information, differed. Scanlon et al. (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 15: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar) hypothesized that κ-PVIIA interaction with the Shakerpotassium channel might be strongly analogous to the charybdotoxin-Shaker channel interaction (for a review of the charybdotoxin family, see Refs. 14Miller C. Neuron. 1995; 15: 5-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar and 15Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Although the two toxins share little primary sequence homology, it was suggested that specific amino acids in the κ-conotoxin (His11, Arg18, Lys19, and Arg22) might correspond to four key residues in charybdotoxin (Lys11, Arg25, Lys27, and Arg31). In contrast, Savarinet al. (13Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggested that a dyad motif of lysine and an aromatic residue (Lys7 and Phe9 or Phe23) shared by a variety of unrelated toxins that inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels, including charybdotoxin from scorpion and BgK from sea anemone (2Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4802-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (307) Google Scholar), would be a key determinant for κ-conotoxin PVIIA binding to the Shaker channel. We have carried out a mutant cycle analysis of κ-conotoxin PVIIA; the results identify a binding surface on the toxin that is clearly critical for high affinity K+ channel blocking and provide functional evidence for evaluating the two hypotheses that were presented on the basis of structural information. The protected peptide resin was built using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described previously (11Shon K. Stocker M. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Jacobsen R. Walker C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with side chains protected as follows: pentamethylchromasulfonyl (Arg), t-butyl (Hyp, Asp, and Ser), S-trityl (Asn, Gln, His, and Cys), andt-butoxycarbonyl (Lys). Protocols for the removal of peptide from resin, HPLC purification, and disulfide bridge formation have been detailed before (11Shon K. Stocker M. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Jacobsen R. Walker C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Under standard glutathione oxidation conditions, native κ-PVIIA folds into the biologically active form with >90% efficiency. Although some analogs folded with much lower efficiency, the correctly folded isomer was often well separated from other isomers during HPLC purification, making identification of the correctly folded form straightforward. Electrospray mass spectroscopy was carried out on all peptide analogs to confirm correct synthesis. One isoform, Asn21–Ala, could not be properly folded, and two other isoforms, Hyp4–Ala and Asn5–Ala, showed much reduced block but were obtained in yields that were insufficient for complete testing. Multiple substitutions for Arg2, Lys7, and Phe9 were synthesized and folded (Arg2–Ala, Arg2–Gln, Arg2–Lys, Lys7–Ala, Lys7–Arg, Phe9–Ala, Phe9–Met, and Phe9–Tyr). The pattern of mixed folded isomers obtained for all analogs was very similar to wild-type κ-PVIIA. The earliest eluting major peak was collected and purified, and in each case, presumed to have the same disulfide connectivity as native PVIIA; one substitution for each of the three loci (Arg2–Ala, Lys7–Ala, and Phe9–Met) was analyzed by NMR and CD to confirm directly that the disulfide connectivity was native. However, Hyp4–Ala, Asn5–Ala, Leu12–Ala, and Asp14–Ala were difficult to purify in high yield, and their structures have not been confirmed. The Leu12–Ala analog in particular showed an unusual pattern of isomers following folding and needs to be further investigated. The coding region ofShaker H4 employed in this study was cloned into Bluescript vector. Point mutations in the pore region were introduced by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis, and the amplified sequences were confirmed by sequencing. Capped cRNA was synthesized in vitro after linearizing the plasmid with HindIII, and the transcription with T7 RNA polymerase was performed by a standard protocol (16Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 397-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were prepared as described previously (17Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pfluegers Arch. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 18Stühmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Frogs were anesthetized with 0.2% tricaine in ice water during surgery. cRNA coding for Shaker H4 was injected into oocytes, and the cells were incubated 1–7 days to allow expression of the protein. Prior to the electrophysiological measurements the vitelline membranes of the oocytes were removed mechanically with fine forceps. Whole cell currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp control using a Turbo-Tec amplifier (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany). The intracellular electrodes were filled with 2 m KCl and had a resistance between 0.6 and 1 MΩ. Current records were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (−3 db) and sampled at 4 kHz. The bath solution was normal frog Ringer's containing (in mm) the following: 115 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.2 (NaOH). To estimate the IC50 value of κ-conotoxin PVIIA and the corresponding analogs, whole cell currents of oocytes expressing either wild-type Shaker H4 K+ channel or mutant isoforms were recorded, and the peak currents, at a test voltage of 0 mV, were measured. IC50 values were calculated according to IC50 = fc/(1 − fc) · [Tx], where fc is the fractional current, and [Tx] is the toxin concentration applied. This is an approximation for calculating the affinity of the toxin for the closed state of the ion channel protein (19Terlau H. Boccaccio A. Olivera B.M. Conti F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Toxin concentrations were determined by assuming that the integrated absorbance (determined by HPLC) was equivalent for all analogs (1 μmol = 33A 220 units) except for Ala substitution for aromatic residues, where this value was reduced by 10%. The maximal toxin concentration tested for analogues of κ-conotoxin PVIIA that showed a low affinity to the Shaker K+ channel was usually 50 μm. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at room temperature (19–22 °C). This method provides a means of revealing interactions between given pairs of toxin and channel residues as described earlier (20Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 21Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Values for the coupling coefficient Ω were obtained by using the formula Ω = (IC50WTchannel:WTtoxin ·IC50 mutchannel:muttoxin)/(IC50WTchannel:muttoxin · IC50mutchannel:WTtoxin). Unity reflects no interaction, whereas deviation from unity indicates progressively stronger interactions. For Ω < 1 the reciprocal is given for ease of comparison of their deviation from unity (20Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The change in coupling energy, ΔΔG, for a given pair of toxin-channel residues was calculated according to ΔΔG = RT ln Ω (with R = 8.314 Jmol−1K−1 and T = 295 K) (20Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 22Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Lee C. Hall J.E. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The studies of Schreiber and Fersht (21Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) suggest that a pair of residues showing a change in ΔΔG > 2.1 kJ/mol−1 may be expected to lie within 5 Å of each other (see also Ref. 23Rauer H. Pennington M. Cahalan M. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21885-21892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Analogs of κ-PVIIA containing alanine substitutions in each amino acid position of the peptide were synthesized and folded (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the affinity of these isoforms was functionally assayed by electrophysiological measurements using theXenopus oocyte expression system. Fig.1 shows whole cell currents from oocytes expressing Shaker H4 K+ channels measured at different test potentials. Addition of 1 μm of four isoforms, His11–Ala, Arg18–Ala, Arg19–Ala, and Arg22–Ala, of κ-conotoxin PVIIA leads to a block of the evoked currents of about 60 to 80%. Alanine substitutions of Ile3, Gln10, Asp13, and Ser17 gave similar results. For these eight isoforms, the IC50 values were all within 5-fold of wild-type κ-conotoxin PVIIA (see TableI). We note that some substitutions (Ile3–Ala and Gln10–Ala, for example) cause a bigger change in the IC50 value than do others (such as Asp13–Ala, Ser17–Ala, and Lys19–Ala, which were all within 2-fold of wild-type PVIIA). Thus, residues such as Ile3 or Gln10could well make some contribution to the interaction of PVIIA with theShaker channel, but this would be relatively minor compared with the residues discussed below.Table IIC50 values for wild-type κ-conotoxin PVIIA and analogsAnalogIC50Number of cellsnmPVIIA57 ± 49R2A>50,0005R2Q>50,0003R2K>50,0003I3A170 ± 105O4A*1-aThese analogs gave very low yields upon folding, insufficient for an NMR analysis.

In contrast to the mutations of the eight amino acid residues of κ-conotoxin PVIIA described above, mutations of other residues resulted in a major reduction of the affinity for ShakerK+ channels; the IC50 values of the different isoforms are summarized in Table I. Examples of κ-conotoxin PVIIA analogs that dramatically diminished activity are presented in Fig.2. Because the alanine mutation at position 2 (Arg2–Ala) resulted in an isoform of κ-conotoxin PVIIA that did not block the evoked ShakerK+ currents, this residue was also mutated to a lysine (Arg2–Lys), and the affinity of this isoform was investigated. The upper panel of Fig. 2 shows that even 20 μm of the isoform Arg2–Lys of κ-conotoxin PVIIA has almost no effect on the evoked ShakerK+ currents. This demonstrates that even a charge-conserving substitution at residue 2 of κ-conotoxin PVIIA results in a profound reduction in toxin affinity, suggesting that the arginine at this position is critically important for the interaction of the toxin with the channel protein. Similar results were obtained with the alanine mutation of the lysine at position 7. The middle panel of Fig. 2 shows that even at a concentration of 50 μm the Lys7–Ala isoform had almost no blocking effect on the evoked currents. The same results were obtained with mutations of the phenylalanine at position 9 (Fig. 2, lower panel). Interestingly, even a conservative substitution of phenylalanine to a tyrosine reduced the block by an order of magnitude (see Table I). Alanine mutations of the amino acid residues Gln6, Phe23, Asn24, and Lys25 exhibited an intermediate behavior in that the IC50 values of these isoforms were higher than 500 nm but less than or near 10 μm. A summary of the IC50 values of all isoforms tested is given in Table I. Thus, the alanine walk mutagenesis of κ-conotoxin PVIIA has identified several residues critical for functional block of theShaker channel. A diagrammatic representation of the most important residues is shown in Fig. 3. The critical residues are colored red, and it is immediately apparent that these are adjacent to each other in the three-dimensional structure, though not in the primary amino acid sequence. The toxin surface, which presumably interacts with the outer vestibule of theShaker pore to cause a channel block, is strongly suggested by our study to contain Arg2, Lys7, and Phe9 as key amino acids. Two other positions, Leu12 and Asp14, may also play a critical role in κ-PVIIA-Shaker interaction. As shown in Table I, the Leu12–Ala and Asp14–Ala analogs were inactive; however, the yields upon folding these analogs were very poor, and we were unable to obtain sufficient amounts to do an NMR analysis. For this reason, we have been conservative in our interpretation and have not colored these residues red in the model shown in Fig. 3. We note however that these are adjacent to the three confirmed critical residues on the toxin surface. The differing predictions of Savarin et al. (13Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Scanlonet al. (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 15: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar) can be compared using these results. Scanlonet al. (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 15: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar) suggested that four positively charged residues in κ-PVIIA were analogous to certain residues in charybdotoxin for interaction with the Shaker channel. A key residue in charybdotoxin is Lys27, which is postulated to directly occlude the pore of the channel (24Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); Scanlon et al. (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 15: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar) suggested that the analogous position would be Lys19 of κ-conotoxin PVIIA. Other charged residues that have been shown to be important in the charybdotoxin-Shaker interaction are Arg25, Lys11, and Lys31 (25Goldstein S.A.N. Pheasant D.J. Miller C. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1377-1388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); the suggested analogous residues were Arg18, His11, and Arg22 of κ-conotoxin. The results of the alanine walk mutagenesis study described above do not support the postulated charybdotoxin analogy. In particular, the Lys19–Ala analog has an IC50 value for theShaker channel close to that of the wild-type toxin. None of the other proposed residues show much change in IC50 when substituted by alanine; all gave values within a factor of 5 of the wild-type value and are among the residues represented in green in Fig.3. The analogous placement of positive charges at the three-dimensional level between charybdotoxin and κ-conotoxin PVIIA appears not to be functionally significant. There were prior indications from electrophysiological work that some of the specific interactions of κ-conotoxin PVIIA residues with outer vestibule amino acids of the Shaker channel pore were probably significantly different from charybdotoxin-Shakerinteractions. Most notably, the mutation Phe425–Gly onShaker increases the affinity of charybdotoxin by ∼2,000-fold (26Goldstein S.A.N. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 5-7Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but abolishes the binding of κ-PVIIA at the concentrations tested (11Shon K. Stocker M. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Jacobsen R. Walker C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The conservative mutation Phe425–Tyr has close to wild-type κ-PVIIA affinity, suggesting an important role for an aromatic residue at this position in the PVIIA-Shaker interaction. Savarin et al. (13Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) postulated that, like other polypeptide toxins that are able to inhibit K+ channels, there may have been convergent evolution in one key feature of otherwise structurally unrelated toxins, the presence of a dyad consisting of a lysine residue (postulated to directly interact with the pore) and a hydrophobic amino acid (2Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4802-4809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Upon considering the various choices in κ-conotoxin PVIIA, Savarin et al. (13Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) predicted that for κ-conotoxin PVIIA the likely key residues were Lys7 and either Phe9 or Phe23 of κ-PVIIA. Our results confirm that Lys7 and Phe9 are indeed important for binding of κ-conotoxin to the Shaker potassium channel (and to a much lesser extent, so is Phe23). Another notable feature of the predictions of Savarin et al. (13Savarin P. Guenneugues M. Gilquin B. Lamthanh H. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Ménez A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5407-5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is a potential role for Lys25. This residue makes Van der Waals contact with Lys7 (mean distance of αC atoms derived from NMR structure is 4.4 Å), and an arrangement of two proximal lysine residues was compared with a similar motif in dendrotoxin that was found to have functional significance (27Smith L. Reed P.F. Wang F.C. Parcej D.N. Schmidt J.J. Olson M.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7690-7696Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We find that the Lys25 mutant has the most reduced affinity of the analogs in the intermediate group (those residues colored yellow in Fig. 3), with an IC50 value ∼100-fold higher than the wild-type peptide. A number of pore mutations of the Shaker channel were generated, and affinities of PVIIA and PVIIA mutants were measured. The effects of these single amino acid substitutions on the affinity of wild-type PVIIA are shown in Fig. 4. The mutations Lys427–Asn and Lys427–Asp resulted in an increased affinity of PVIIA of a factor of ∼2. Similar effects have been reported for Lys427–Glu (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. Structure. 1997; 15: 1585-1597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several other mutations (Phe425–Gly, Thr449–Lys, Thr449–Tyr, Thr449–Gln (11Shon K. Stocker M. Terlau H. Stühmer W. Jacobsen R. Walker C. Grilley M. Watkins M. Hillyard D.R. Gray W.R. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and Val451–Lys) were not sensitive to PVIIA and therefore were not useful for the cycling analysis. All other channel mutations led to a slight reduction of PVIIA affinity or had no measurable effect (see Fig. 4, lower panel). The results of the mutant cycling analysis are shown in TableII and Fig.5. The mutant PVIIA peptides (with single amino acid substitutions) were tested against twelve different mutantShaker channel isoforms. In most cases, strong interactions were not detected (the Ω values were close to 1, and the coupling energy (ΔΔG) was close to 0). However, some Ω values obtained provide at least suggestive data for the orientation of the peptide in the postulated outer vestibule of the channel. The Ω value for the Lys25–Ala (toxin)-Met448–Lys (channel) pair of 7.3, which is equivalent to a ΔΔG value of 4.86 kJ/mol−1, indicates an interaction between these two residues. Lys25 is close to Phe9 on the toxin molecule (distance of the αC atoms is ∼8 Å). The interaction between Lys25 and Met448 makes the relatively modest Ω value of 2.7 for the Phe9–Tyr (toxin)-Thr449–Ser (channel) pair potentially significant. Any other substitution for Phe9, except Tyr, decreased the IC50 value below detectable limits, and we were therefore constrained to using this conservative substitution (even the Phe9–Met substitution abolished detectable activity). This is suggestive evidence that the key Thr449 residue, known to play a role in charybdotoxin binding, may be in close proximity to Phe9 of PVIIA. Thus, Phe9 of κ-conotoxin PVIIA may be at a homologous locus in the vestibule to Tyr36 in charybdotoxin, i.e. the aromatic residue of the dyad postulated by Ménez and co-workers (2Dauplais M. Lecoq A. Song J. Cotton J. Jamin N. Gilquin B. Roumestand C. Vita C. de Medeiros C. Rowan E.G. Harvey A.L. Ménez A. J. Biol.

The Ω values obtained for the Arg22–Ala (toxin)-Asn423–Lys (channel) pair of 3.6 and the Ile3–Ala (toxin)-Ser424–Lys (channel) pair of 3.0 might indicate that there is also some interaction of these residues. Unfortunately, because no substitution for Arg2and Lys7 has been found that gives measurable affinity, we were unable to carry out a mutant cycling analysis for these important loci. By using the spatial constraints that can be derived from the mutant cycle experiments, a docking of PVIIA into the KcsA crystal structure reveals that the docking configuration may fit with the mutant cycling data. An alignment of the residues that make up the pore regions of Shaker and KcsA is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 4. By assuming that Lys25 of κ-PVIIA is in the vicinity of Leu81 (Met448 inShaker), Phe9 of the toxin can be positioned close to Tyr82 (Thr449) of the adjacent subunit of the channel pore vestibule (not shown). In this orientation, Lys7 of κ-PVIIA is facing toward the ion channel pore. Furthermore, Arg22 of κ-PVIIA is close to Gly56 (Asn423) and Ala57(Ser424) of the same channel subunit with which Lys25 interacts, whereas Ile3 of κ-PVIIA is in the vicinity of Ala57 (Ser424) of the channel opposite to that with which Phe9 interacts. In summary, the data in this report do not support the predictions of Scanlon et al. (12Scanlon M.J. Naranjo D. Thomas L. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J.

Consequently, effector enzymes are activated, resulting in a fast and transient pulse of second messengers, which finally trigger the electric response of the cell (1Ache B.W.

These findings fuel the hypothesis that the participating molecules may be organized in preassembled signaling complexes to minimize diffusion routes and to control cross-talk between different signaling pathways (9Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Specialized membrane microdomains and scaffolding proteins have been proposed as structural organizers for such multimolecular signaling assemblies in various cell types (10Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl.

Caveolins are 21–24-kDa membrane proteins, originally identified in trans-Golgi network-derived exocytotic vesicles (18Kurzchalia T.V. Dupree P. Parton R.G. Kellner R. Virta H. Lehnert M. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and flask-shaped membrane invaginations called caveolae (19Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). Caveolins are inserted into the lipid bilayer by an internal hydrophobic hairpin domain, which was illustratively described as the caveolin “greasy elbow configuration” (20Das K. Lewis R.Y. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18721-18728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Caveolins strongly bind cholesterol (21Murata M. Peränen J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 could function cooperatively in the formation and stabilization of large lipid microdomains (28Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P.V. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Simons and Ikonen propose a “raft hypothesis” for the lateral organization of lipid bilayers (12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Accordingly, assemblies of sphingolipids and cholesterol create biochemically distinct microdomains (rafts) in a glycerophospholipid environment. Such rafts may recruit and exclude specific sets of membrane proteins based on their physicochemical properties and may therefore be viewed as platforms to concentrate signaling molecules within the lipid bilayer. The properties of caveolin could enable this protein to sequester raft lipids, eventually forming and organizing large stabilized raft domains in the plasma membrane (28Harder T. Scheiffele P. Verkade P.V. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 929-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 29Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 3: 467-479Crossref Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In addition, caveolins reportedly interact with multiple components of G protein-mediated signaling pathways, including receptors, G proteins, and effector enzymes (14Kurzchalia T.V. Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar,30Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

Accordingly, caveolin-mediated clustering and dispersion of raft domains could contribute to regulating and shaping G protein-mediated signaling. In this study we addressed the question of whether caveolins may play such a role in olfactory sensory neurons. We examined their subcellular distribution in the main olfactory epithelium (MOE)1and vomeronasal organ (VNO) of the rat and evaluated their possible function in the odor-induced second messenger signaling. Male and female adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The odorants citralva (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadiennitrile), hedione (3-oxo-2-pentylcyclopentaneacetic acid methyl ester), eugenol (2-methoxy-4-(2-propenyl)phenol), lilial (para-butyl-α-methylhydrocinnamic aldehyde), and lyral (4-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-3-cyclohexene-10-carboxyldehyde) were provided by DROM (Baierbrunn, Germany). Isovaleric acid (3-methylbutanoic acid), triethylamine, GTPγS, and goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Sigma. Forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were supplied by Calbiochem. Antibodies against Gαs, Gαi, Gαo, adenylyl cyclase type III, phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2), caveolin-1, caveolin-3, as well as agarose-conjugated caveolin-1 antibodies were provided by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Caveolin-2-specific antibodies were purchased from Affiniti (Mamhead, UK). The enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL) for Western blots, the radioligand assay kits for cAMP, and myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) determination were provided by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were from Sigma and had the purity of more than 99%. Peptides corresponding to the scaffolding domains of caveolin-1 (amino acid positions 82–101, DGIWKASFTTFTVTKYWFYR) and caveolin-2 (amino acid positions 54–73, DKVWICSHALFEISKYVMYK) were synthesized by Dr. H. Kalbacher (University of Tübingen, Germany) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography to >98%, as confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis. A control peptide located N-terminal from the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (amino acid positions 53–81, RDPKHLNDDVVKIDFEDVIAEPEGTHSF) was purchased from Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). Olfactory cilia were prepared using the calcium shock method according to Anholt (34Anholt R.R. Aebi U. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 1962-1969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after a short wash of the olfactory epithelia in ice-cold Ringer solution (120 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.6 mmK2HPO3, 25 mm NaHCO3, 7.5 mm glucose, pH 7.4), the tissue was subjected to Ringer solution supplemented with 10 mm calcium chloride and gently stirred for 5 min at 4 °C. Detached cilia were isolated by three sequential centrifugation steps for 5 min at 7,700 ×g. The supernatants were collected, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in Ringer solution including 10 mmcalcium as described above. The cilia preparation was collected by a final centrifugation step of the pooled supernatants for 15 min at 27,000 × g. The resulting pellet containing the cilia was resuspended in hypotonic TME buffer (10 mm Tris, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7. 4) and stored at −70 °C. Microvilli fractions from rat VNO were prepared as described previously (35Kroner C. Breer H. Singer A.G. O'Connell R.J. Neuroreport. 1996; 25: 2989-2992Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, VNOs were removed from fertile female rats, washed twice in Ringer solution, and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen until further use. VNOs from 30–60 animals were thawed on ice, minced, and subsequently stirred for 10 min at 4 °C in Ringer solution containing 10 mm calcium chloride. After removing the debris by centrifugation (10 min, 3,000 ×g), the supernatant was collected while the pellet was resuspended in Ringer solution containing 10 mm calcium and processed as described above. The pooled supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 48,000 × g, and the resulting pellet containing the microvilli membrane fragments was resuspended in hypotonic TME buffer and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 65: 248-254Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Detergent-insoluble membrane fractions were purified as described previously (37Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly dissected rat olfactory epithelia from the nasal septum and the ethmoid turbinates or from VNOs were collected and minced in TME buffer. An aliquot of 1 ml of protein solution (4 μg/μl) was diluted with lysis buffer (25 mmMes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, pH 6.5), adjusted to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 or, alternatively, 60 mm octyl glycoside, and solubilized for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, samples were mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in lysis puffer, placed on the bottom of a 12-ml centrifuge tube, and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (6 ml of 30% sucrose, 4 ml of 5% sucrose, both prepared in lysis buffer). Samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 16 h. Fractions of 1 ml were collected from the top (fraction 1–12), whereas the pellet of the gradient was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (fraction 13). Aliquots of each fraction were stored at −70 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of detergent-insoluble membrane fractions of olfactory epithelium or isolated olfactory cilia isolated by equilibrium sucrose density centrifugation were lysed for 10 min on ice with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml of each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, pH 7.4) containing 60 mm oytyl glycoside. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with an agarose-conjugated anti-caveolin-1 antibody; after three washes, bound protein was eluted with an aliquot of 5× sample buffer (625 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 5% SDS, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromphenol blue), boiled for 2 min, and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Aliquots of sucrose gradient fractions or protein samples from sensory epithelia (38Krieger J. Schleicher S. Strotmann J. Wanner I. Boekhoff I. Raming K. De Geus P. Breer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were mixed with 5× sample buffer, boiled for 2 min, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Laemmli buffer system (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 225: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blot was stained with Ponceau S, dried, and stored at 4 °C until further use. For Western blot analysis, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder (Naturaflor, Dietmannsriel, Germany) in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Subsequently, the blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies diluted in TBST containing 3% nonfat milk powder. After three washes with TBST, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution in TBST with 3% milk powder) was applied. After three washes with TBST, the ECL system was used to visualize bound antibodies. Stimulation experiments were performed for 2 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath as described previously (40Boekhoff I. Touhara K. Danner S. Inglese J. Lohse M.J. Breer H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4606-4612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, test substances (e.g. odorants, forskolin, or GTPγS) were diluted in reaction buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mmEGTA, 50 mm Mops, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% sodium cholate, 1 mmATP, 4 μm GTP, 12 nm free calcium calculated and adjusted as described (41Pershadsingh H.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 225: 4087-4093Google Scholar), pH 7.4). To prevent degradation of cAMP and IP3, stimulation was performed in the presence of either 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine or 20 mm LiCl. The reaction was started by mixing 200 μl of prewarmed reaction buffer with 30 μl of isolated olfactory cilia. After stopping the reaction by the addition of 100 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid (7%), quenched samples were stored on ice for 20 min, followed by determination of the concentrations of cAMP or IP3 according to Steiner et al. (42Steiner A.L. Pagliara A.S. Chase L.R. Kipnis D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1114-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Palmeret al. (43Palmer S. Hughes K.T. Lee D.Y. Wakema M.J.O. Cell. Signal. 1989; 1: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), respectively. The applied concentrations of the different modulators in the results section represent concentrations during pretreatment of the microvilli preparations or ligand concentrations in the reaction buffer. To analyze the expression of caveolins in rat olfactory neurons, preparations of MOE and VNO were probed with subtype-specific anti-caveolin antisera on Western blots. For this purpose, total MOE and VNO samples were prepared by homogenizing freshly dissected tissue in TME buffer. Sensory cilia and microvilli fragments were separated from cells by the addition of calcium chloride and purified by multiple centrifugation steps. Equal amounts of protein from each preparation were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were subsequently probed with caveolin-1- and caveolin-2-specific antibodies, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence detection. As shown in Fig. 1, both antibodies recognized a band of about 25 kDa in all preparations, consistent with the predicted molecular masses of caveolin-1 and -2 of about 22.000 (30Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Comparing the relative band intensities, we found both caveolin subtypes enriched in cilia and microvilli fractions of MOE and VNO, respectively. Centrifugation at high speed of cilia and microvilli lead to a further enrichment of immunoreactivity of both caveolin subtypes in the membrane pellet (data not shown). Antibodies directed to the muscle-specific subtype caveolin-3 did not label a polypeptide at the predicted size of this caveolin subtype (data not shown). The data indicate that caveolin-1 and -2 are expressed in both rat olfactory organs, MOE and VNO. Furthermore, enrichment of both caveolin subtypes in sensory membranes points to a possible colocalization with components of olfactory signal transduction cascades in the appropriate subcellular compartments. Caveolins have been found to segregate into detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched membrane domains (DIGs) (31Parton R.G. Simon K. Science. 1995; 269: 1398-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To test whether this may also be the case for caveolins expressed in olfactory tissues, we isolated low density membrane fractions from MOE and VNO using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. In the past, association with detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton proteins was made responsible for Triton X-100 insolubility at 4 °C. The detection of multiple glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in DIGs, however, established Triton X-100 insolubility as the basis for isolating lipid rafts and associated proteins (44Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Olfactory epithelia from MOE and VNO were homogenized in Triton X-100-containing lysis buffer at 4 °C, and after centrifugation, equal volumes of each of the 13 fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.2 A), revealing a highly skewed protein distribution along the gradient. As determined by protein quantification for each fraction (data not shown), more than 90% of the total protein was found in high density fractions representing Triton X-100-soluble components (lanes 9–13 in Fig.2 A). Only 10% of the total protein localized to the low density fractions (lanes 1–8). In contrast, when the fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis as described above, most of the caveolin-1 and -2 immunoreactivity was found concentrated in low density fractions 3–5 of the MOE (Fig. 2, B and C) and the VNO (Fig. 3,A and B). Replacing Triton X-100 in the lysis buffer by 60 mm octyl glycoside completely abolished this pattern, leaving all caveolin-1 immunoreactivity from MOE (Fig.2 D) and from VNO (Fig. 3 C) in the high density fractions 10–13. Similar results were obtained for caveolin-2 (data not shown). These results demonstrate that both caveolin subtypes show a strong tendency to associate with DIGs isolated from olfactory epithelia as described for other tissues (45Lisanti M.P. Tang Z.

Biol. 1995; 12: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Figure 3Subcellular fractionation of olfactory sensory tissue from the VNO. Low density Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were obtained from sensory tissue of the VNO using a sucrose density gradient centrifugation procedure. Equal aliquots were collected from the top of the gradient and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Upon solubilization at 4 °C with Triton X-100, endogenous caveolin-1 (A) and caveolin-2 (B), visualized with subtype-specific antibodies (1:1,000), are restricted to the low density fractions 3 and 4, whereas upon treatment with octyl glycoside, caveolin-1 is localized to the high density fractions 10–13 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether key components of the olfactory G protein-coupled signal transduction cascades are enriched within DIG fractions from rat olfactory tissues along with caveolins, we monitored the distribution of two major olfactory Gα subtypes from MOE, Gαs and Gαo (46Schandar M. Laugwitz K.-L. Boekhoff I. Kroner C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Breer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16669-16677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in sucrose density gradients. Western blot analysis with subtype-specific anti-Gα antibodies detected some immunoreactivity for Gαs (Fig.4 A) and Gαo(Fig. 4 B) in Triton X-100-soluble high density fractions 7–12. The most of these proteins, however, were concentrated in Triton X-100-insoluble low density fractions 4–6. Replacing Triton X-100 by 60 mm octyl glycoside in the lysis buffer released the immunoreactivity for both proteins (data shown for Gαsonly) into the soluble high density fractions (Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained when preparations from VNO were used (Fig. 5). Gαi and Gαo subtypes have been suggested to mediate chemosensory signal transduction in this tissue (47Halpern M. Shapiro L.S. Jia C. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 48Berghard A. Buck L.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 908-918Crossref Google Scholar, 49Krieger J. Schmitt A.

Again, the majority of both G protein α-subunits co-migrated with the Triton X-100-insoluble low density fractions. Comparable experiments with an antibody against a conserved domain of all five known rat Gβ subtypes revealed a similar distribution (data not shown). To test whether further downstream signaling molecules of the olfactory transduction pathways co-migrate in the low density fractions along with caveolins and G proteins, the distributions of two key effector enzymes, adenylyl cyclase III and PLCβ2 (50Bakalyar H.A. Reed R.R. Science. 1990; 250: 1403-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 51Noé J. Breer H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2286-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), were monitored in sucrose density gradients. Again, homogenates from MOE were prepared as described above and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. After SDS-PAGE separation of each fraction, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies specific to rat adenylyl cyclase III (Fig. 6 A) and PLCβ2 (Fig. 6 B) proteins. We found significant immunoreactivity for both enzymes in Triton X-100-insoluble low density fractions 4–6, suggesting their co-localization with caveolins and G proteins in common lipid compartments of sensory membranes. Several studies indicate that in vivo, caveolin 1 and caveolin 2 form a hetero-oligomeric complex (for review, see Ref. 16Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). To explore whether caveolin-1 may interact with caveolin-2, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a caveolin-1-specific antibody conjugated to agarose; therefore, Triton X-100-insoluble low density membrane fractions isolated by sucrose density centrifugation were solubilized with octyl glycoside and subsequently used in immunoprecipitation experiments; to assess the specificity of the procedure, protein samples were incubated either with non-immune rabbit IgG (Fig. 7, IgG), or alternatively, antibodies used in Western blotting were preincubated with the specific peptide (Fig. 7, +P). As demonstrated in Fig. 7, caveolin-1 was effectively precipitated by its respective antibody (panel A,Cav1) compared with the labeling of the caveolin-1 antibody observed in isolated olfactory cilia (panel A,Ci), whereas no immunostaining was detectable in control samples (panel A, IgG and Cav1 + P). When caveolin-1 precipitates were probed with caveolin-2-specific antibodies, an intense immunoreactivity for caveolin-2 was observed (Fig. 7, panel B, Cav2), indicating that hetero-oligomeric complexes of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 exist in the olfactory sensory epithelium. Caveolin forms higher ordered complexes with a variety of signal transduction molecules (for review: see Ref. 16Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar); to determine if caveolin-1 is associated with olfactory G protein α-subunits, caveolin-1 precipitates were probed with subtype-specific antibodies for Gαs and Gαo; as demonstrated in Fig. 7, no staining for both G protein-subtypes was detected in control samples, whereas in the caveolin precipitates, a significant amount of Gαs (panel C) and Gαo(panel D) was detected. To explore whether effector enzymes involved in olfactory signaling are also associated with caveolin, immunoprecipitates of caveolin-1 antibodies were also assessed for adenylyl cyclase and PLCβ2 immunoreactivity; Fig. 7 shows that adenylyl cyclase (panel E) and PLCβ2 (panel F) are both co-eluted with caveolin-1, indicating that G protein α-subunits as well as effector enzymes of the olfactory signaling pathways form complexes with caveolin-1. To examine the functional significance of interactions between caveolins and other olfactory signaling molecules we performed two different experimental approaches. Using antibodies specific to caveolin-1 (Fig. 8 A) and caveolin-2 (Fig. 8 B), we attempted to sterically protect caveolin proteins from homo- and heterophilic interactions. In addition, we sought to competitively replace caveolins from potential interaction partners with synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of caveolin-1 (Fig.9 A) and caveolin-2 (Fig.9 B) scaffolding domains, which reportedly are involved in homo- and hetero-oligomerization of caveolins and in binding to other signaling proteins (20Das K.

Glucosinolates are present in the Capparales order, including the family Brassicaceae, whose many cultivars have provided mankind with a source of condiments, vegetables, forage crops, and the economically important crop oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.). Glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by specific thioglucosidases, called myrosinases, to produce a wide range of degradation products, typically isothiocyanates, nitriles, and thiocyanates, with different biological activities. The glucosinolate/myrosinase system is believed to play a role in plant-pest interaction. The degradation products serve as attractants for insect specialists and as repellents for generalist herbivores, insects, and microorganisms (for review see Ref. 1Halkier B.A. Ikan R. Naturally Occurring Glycosides. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 193-223Google Scholar). Glucosinolates are present in all parts of the plant. The level of glucosinolates varies in different tissues at different developmental stages (2Fieldsend J. Milford G.F. Ann. Appl.

Generally, high levels of biosynthesis are found in young leaves (10Bergman F. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1970; 62: 362-375Google Scholar,11Lykkesfeldt J. Møller B.L. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), shoots, and silique walls (12Lein K.A. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1972; 67: 333-342Crossref Google Scholar); however, the high content of glucosinolates in young leaves declines rapidly after maturation (3Porter A.J.R. Morton A.M. Kiddle G. Doughty K.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Ann. Appl. Biol. 1991; 118: 461-467Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). How plants manage to tissue-specifically and developmentally turn over the pool of glucosinolates in a physiological safe manner is not known. There are several studies indicating that glucosinolates are transported within the plant. For example, in Tropaeolum majus high amount of benzylglucosinolate, which is primarily synthesized in the leaves, is also found to accumulate in other tissues, such as developing seeds, indicating translocation (11Lykkesfeldt J. Møller B.L. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additionally, analysis of the glucosinolate profile of seed and leaf tissue of B. napus F1 hybrids, from reciprocal crosses between the cv. Cobra and a synthetic line, showed that the profile of the aliphatic glucosinolates in the seed was identical to the profile in the leaves of the maternal parent (13Magrath R. Mithen R. Plant Breed. 1993; 111: 249-252Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggested that glucosinolate biosynthesis and glucosinolate interconversions (e.g. hydroxylation, desaturation, and alkenylation) did not take place within the embryo and that the fully formed glucosinolates were transferred from maternal tissue into the developing seeds. Furthermore, in vivo feeding of radiolabeled tyrosine to isolated seeds and intact siliques of Sinapis alba showed that although a low rate of de novo biosynthesis of p-OHBG1 occurred in the seed, the majority of p-OHBG was synthesized de novo in the silique wall and subsequently transported to the seed (14Du L. Halkier B.A. Phytochemistry. 1998; 48: 1145-1150Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, Toroser et al. (15Toroser D. Griffiths H. Wood C. Thomas D.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1753-1760Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) provided indications of the presence of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate:desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase activity in seeds of B. napus, which suggested that desulfoglucosinolates were the transport form of glucosinolates. Recently, Brudenell et al. (16Brudenell A.J.P. Griffiths H. Rossiter J.T. Baker D.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 745-756Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have observed phloem mobility of radiolabeled glucosinolates and desulfoglucosinolates in B. napus plants. By comparison of the measured data with the predicted values obtained using the Kleier model for phloem mobility of xenobiotics, it was concluded that both glucosinolates and desulfoglucosinolates had suitable physicochemical properties to allow phloem mobility. In support of phloem mobility of glucosinolates, aphid feeding experiments on black mustard, B. nigra L. cv. Koch, have shown that there was more than 10 mmsinigrin in phloem sap of young leaves, whereas there was very low concentration of glucosinolates (about 1–2 mm) in mature, presenescent, and senescent leaves (17Merritt S.Z. J. Chem. Ecol. 1996; 22: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown that the uptake of glucosinolates in excised embryos of B. napus exhibited saturable kinetics and was inhibited by protonophores such as CCCP, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and the respiratory chain inhibitor NaN3 (18Gijzen M. McGregor I. Seguin-Swartz G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Gijzen M. Seguin-Swartz G. McGregor I. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 144: 17-21Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The data strongly indicated that the uptake of glucosinolates was by a carrier-mediated transport system. In the present paper, we have used isolated protoplasts from young leaves of B. napus to study uptake of glucosinolates. Biochemical characterization of the uptake provided evidence for the presence of a glucosinolate/H+symporter in rape leaf cells. Seeds of oilseed rape B. napus L. (cv. Partim) were purchased from DLF Trifolium, Denmark. The seeds were soaked and sown in potting mix (Enhetsjord Kjord, Weibulls, Sweden) with no application of nutrients. Plants were grown in the greenhouse for 25–28 days before leaves were harvested for protoplast preparation. The light intensity varied from 200 to 800 μmol of photons/m2/s during the 18-h light periods, day/night temperatures were 18/15 °C, respectively, relative humidity was 50–65%, and water was supplied once every 2nd day. Tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum, cv. Xanthi) were cultured on MS medium, pH 5.6 to 5.8 (20Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53679) Google Scholar), containing 3% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.3% (w/v) Difco agar. In vitro plants were grown at 25 °C, with 15-h light periods and a light intensity of 160 μmol of photons/m/s. Leaves of 21-day-old tobacco seedlings were used for protoplast preparation. Radiolabeled p-OHBG was synthesized in vivo by feeding [14C]- or [3H]tyrosine to detached primary leaves of 21-day-old S. alba plants (21Chen S. Halkier B.A. Phytochem. Anal. 2000; 11: 174-178Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). p-OHBG was extracted with methanol, followed by purification through a Sep-Pak QMA anion exchange column (Waters) and a Dowex (50 W-4) H+ spin column, as described previously (21Chen S. Halkier B.A. Phytochem. Anal. 2000; 11: 174-178Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The purity of the radiolabeled p-OHBG was confirmed with thin layer chromatography and radio high performance liquid chromatography. Viable protoplasts were isolated from leaves using the method described by Glimelius (22Glimelius K. Physiol. Plant. 1984; 61: 38-44Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Protoplasts from B. napus were prepared from approximately 3 g of 5–6 young, fully expanded leaves that were sterilized in 0.5% (v/v) NaOCl, 0.12% (v/v) Tween 20 solution for 5 min, washed in 96% (v/v) ethanol for 2 s, followed by 3 washes in sterile distilled H2O. The leaves were placed in 0.3m sorbitol, 50 mm CaCl2 and sliced into approximately 1–2-mm strips. After 30 min plasmolysis at room temperature, the strips were treated with 20 ml of an enzyme solution containing 1% (w/v) Cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Japan) and 0.2% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Japan) in a buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, 5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.8. After incubation for 8–10 h at 22 °C with gentle rocking, protoplasts were sieved through two layers of nylon mesh with pore diameters of 120 and 80 μm, respectively, and purified by flotation on 0.5 msucrose at 100 × g for 7 min after addition of W5 medium (0.1% (w/v) glucose, 0.08% (w/v) KCl, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and 1.84% (w/v) CaCl2, pH 5.8). The floating protoplasts, which formed a layer between the enzyme solution and W5 medium, were collected with a Pasteur pipette, diluted with W5 medium, centrifuged at 60 × g for 5 min and resuspended in W5 medium. The W5 medium wash was repeated twice. Finally, the protoplasts were resuspended in standard uptake buffer (10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5m sorbitol, and 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.5), unless otherwise stated. Protoplasts from tobacco leaves were prepared using the same protocol, except that 0.1% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10 was used. Protoplast yields were determined by counting samples in a hemocytometer (depth 0.2-mm) after staining with filtered 0.1% (w/v) neutral red in W5 medium. The viability of protoplasts was determined by accumulation of neutral red in the vacuole and exclusion of Evans blue (23Borstlap A.C. Kuyper-Vos A.A. Schuurmans J. Plant Sci. 1987; 48: 55-62Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The protoplasts were used ∼30 min after isolation to analyze for uptake of radiolabeledp-OHBG. Briefly, 2 × 105 protoplasts in standard uptake buffer (see above) were preincubated with 5 μCi of3H2O for 30 min at 25 °C to allow3H2O inside and outside the protoplasts to reach equilibrium, enabling estimation of the protoplast volume (exchangeable water volume) as described previously (23Borstlap A.C. Kuyper-Vos A.A. Schuurmans J. Plant Sci. 1987; 48: 55-62Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 24Fieuw S. Willenbrink J. Plant Sci. 1991; 76: 9-17Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Brown M.M. Hall J.L. Ho L.C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 101: 533-539Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, the amount of 3H2O in the cells was monitored by counting a small aliquot of samples at different time points to ensure that the cells were intact and stable duringp-OHBG uptake. Uptake studies were carried out by addition of 2.5 μCi of [14C]p-OHBG (1.7 μmol) or [3H]p-OHBG (0.16 μmol) to 1 ml of protoplasts (∼105) followed by incubation for different times and/or in the presence of different concentrations of substrates. In a typical experiment, the uptake reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, following which 100-μl aliquots were removed from the uptake assay and transferred to 250-μl polyethylene microcentrifuge tubes (Carl-Ruth, Germany) containing a layer of 120 μl of hydrophobic mixture (silicone oil DC550/liquid paraffin, 21:4, Merck) on top of 10 μl of 0.5 m sorbitol. The aliquots were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 s, which sedimented the protoplasts through the oil layer to the sorbitol layer while the free radiolabeled p-OHBG uptake solution (supernatant) remained on top of the hydrophobic mixture. The tips of the tubes containing the protoplast pellets were cut off and put into 2-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 0.2 ml of 1.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and sonicated for 10 min to rupture cell membranes and release radioactivity into the medium. At the same time, 1 μl of supernatant was also taken for radioactivity assay. The radioactivity of the samples was determined by scintillation counting (Wallac 1400) after addition of 1.2 ml of scintillation fluid Ecoscint A. Uptake of p-OHBG was calculated as nanomoles of p-OHBG/μl of protoplast volume/h. The formula used was {(14C (dpm) in protoplast pellet/3H2O (dpm) in the pellet) × (14C (dpm) in 1 μl of supernatant/3H2O (dpm) in 1 μl of supernatant)} × external p-OHBG concentration (nmol/μl) to calculate the protoplast volume (μl) and the amount of p-OHBG taken up (nanomoles). Correction for the p-OHBG adhering to the outside of the protoplasts was done by subtracting the amount of p-OHBG present in the protoplasts after silicone filtration following 30 s incubation in the uptake reaction mixture. The amount of 3H2O in the protoplasts after silicone oil filtration did not change with time during the experimental period, indicating intactness of the protoplasts. The temperature optimum for uptake of p-OHBG by protoplasts of B. napus was determined by incubation of 1 ml of protoplasts in standard uptake reaction mixtures at several temperatures ranging from 4 to 45 °C. The temperature coefficient (Q 10) for absorption was calculated according to the equation Q 10 = (K 2/K 1)10/(T2−T1)(K 2 and K 1 represent the absorption rate at temperature T 2 and T 1, respectively) (26Donaldson T.W. Bayer D.E. Leonard O.A. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 638-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pH dependence of uptake of p-OHBG was determined by incubation of 1 ml of protoplasts in uptake reaction mixtures containing 10 mmMES-Tris of pH 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, and 8. After 15 min incubation, the protoplasts were centrifuged through silicone oil layer, and the uptake of p-OHBG was quantified as described above. ΔpH across the plasma membrane was developed by diluting 1 volume of protoplasts in uptake buffer, pH 7, into 4 volumes of uptake buffer at pH 4 as described previously (27Bush D.R.

Planta. 1990; 182: 540-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with a final concentration of approximately 105 cells/ml. The uptake measurements were started 30 s later by addition of 2.5 μCi of [14C]p-OHBG and performed as in the standard uptake experiment. Similarly, a decrease and increase in membrane potential (Δψ) were imposed using SCN−, TPP+, or K+ gradients by transferring protoplasts into uptake buffer containing 50 mm NaSCN, 100 μm TPPCl or 50 mm KNO3, respectively. The uptake measurements were started 30 s later as described above. After 15 min incubation, the protoplasts were subjected to silicone oil filtration, and the uptake of p-OHBG was quantified. The substrate specificity of the p-OHBG transport protein in protoplasts of B. napus, with respect to other glucosinolates, was determined by competition experiments in which different glucosinolates at 1 or 5 times the concentration of radiolabeled p-OHBG were included in the standard uptake reaction mixture. Similarly, the affinity of the p-OHBG transport protein for other compounds such as glucosinolate degradation products, glutathione conjugates, hexoses, and amino acids was tested in standard uptake reaction mixtures. These competitors were present at 1 or 10 times the concentration of p-OHBG. The uptake of p-OHBG over the plasma membrane was characterized by preincubation of the protoplasts with various compounds for 30 min before the start of uptake assays. After 15 min incubation with radiolabeled p-OHBG, the uptake of p-OHBG in the protoplasts was determined as described above. Fusicoccin is a stimulator of plasma membrane H+-ATPase, whereas Na3VO4, DCCD, and DES are inhibitors. Arsenite, KCN, and NaN3 are glycolysis and respiration inhibitors. CCCP is a protonophore. PCMBS is a sulfhydryl group modifier. DTT protects protein from sulfhydryl modification. In the case of chemicals dissolved in ethanol, the final concentration of ethanol in the incubation mixture was kept at or below 0.1% (v/v), and controls were made in the corresponding ethanol concentration. Nonlinear regression (performed with the SigmaPlot curve fitter) was used to fit the kinetic data to the equation for two-component Michaelis-Menten kinetics consisting of a saturable component and a linear component (v =V max [S]/(Km + [S]) +k [S]). Statistical analysis (t test or analysis of variance) was performed using the SigmaStat program. Protoplast yields per g fresh weight of B. napus and tobacco leaves were 1.9 × 106 and 2.0 × 106, respectively. The viability of protoplasts as determined by neutral red uptake and Evans blue exclusion was 82.5 ± 4.2%. Uptake of p-OHBG intoB. napus protoplasts showed a steady increase within the 40 min investigated (Fig. 1). The concentration of p-OHBG in the cells after 10 min incubation with [3H]p-OHBG was about 0.57 mmwhich was much higher than that in the uptake medium (less than 0.16 mm). This shows that glucosinolates accumulate against a concentration gradient. Similarly, uptake of p-OHBG was detected in protoplasts isolated from hypocotyls and cotyledons of B. napus (data not shown). No p-OHBG uptake could be detected in tobacco leaf protoplasts (Fig. 1). Uptake of p-OHBG was temperature-dependent with an optimum at 35 °C (data not shown). The temperature may influence the transport activity and/or the dissipation of the pH gradient. The average temperature coefficient (Q 10) determined from the data obtained between temperatures ranging from 4 to 30 °C was 1.8 ± 0.2, which indicates that active processes might be involved. When the uptake of p-OHBG by B. napus protoplasts was carried out in the presence of an increasing concentration of p-OHBG, the uptake kinetics were characterized by a non-saturating curve that approached linearity above the concentration of 5 mm (Fig.2). The kinetics were readily resolved into a saturable and a linear component by nonlinear regression to the two-component equation of Michaelis-Menten kinetics using the Sigma Plot program. The saturable kinetics indicated carrier-mediated translocation with a Km of 1.0 mm and aV max of 28.7 nmol/μl/h. The linear component had very low substrate affinity and may be a channel, or an anion transport mechanism, on the plasma membrane (29O'Driscoll D. Wilson G. Steer M.W. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 237-241Google Scholar). When uptake of p-OHBG by B. napus protoplasts was measured at different pH values, the rate of uptake increased with decreasing pH, with a maximum glucosinolate uptake at pH 4 (Fig.3). The measured effect of lowering pH could reflect proton binding to the transporter and/or proton motive force. When CCCP, a proton ionophore, was added after 10 min of incubation, the uptake of p-OHBG stopped and the accumulatedp-OHBG was released from protoplasts (Fig.4). Transfer of protoplasts from pH 7 into pH 4 prior to uptake measurements resulted in a more than 3-fold increase in p-OHBG uptake (Fig.5). These data are consistent with the idea that p-OHBG accumulation is dependent on proton motive force. Furthermore, we investigated whether there was an effect of altered membrane potential on p-OHBG uptake. Inside negative membrane potential can be decreased (−Δψ) and increased (+Δψ) by addition of SCN−, TPP+, or K+, respectively (30Marshall J. Corzo A. Leigh R.A. Sanders D. Plant J. 1994; 5: 683-694Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Pick U. Katz A. Weiss M. Avron M. Leaver C. Sze H. Plant Membrane: Structure, Function, Biogenesis. Alan R.

Treatment of protoplasts with 50 mmSCN− increased the rate of glucosinolate uptake by approximately 20%. Raising the concentration of K+ or TPP+ slightly reduced the rate of glucosinolate uptake (Fig. 5). The imposed Δψ effects on the uptake were very low, which indicates that the contribution of membrane potential to glucosinolate uptake is small.Figure 4Effect of CCCP on p-OHBG uptake. ∼105 protoplasts in 10 mmMES-Tris uptake buffer, pH 5.5, were incubated with 2.5 μCi of [14C]p-OHBG (1.7 μmol) at 25 °C and stopped at various time points by filtration through silicone oil.

Δψ was altered using SCN−, TPP+, or K+ gradients created by transferring cells into standard uptake buffer, pH 5.5, containing 50 mm NaSCN, 100 μm tetraphenylphosphonium chloride, or 50 mmKNO3, respectively. The final concentration of the cells was ∼105 protoplasts/ml. 30 s after application of the ΔpH or Δψ, the uptake measurements were started by addition of 2.5 μCi of [14C]p-OHBG (1.7 μmol).

Competitive inhibition of p-OHBG uptake was only observed when different glucosinolates were included in the uptake reaction mixture (Fig.6). No competitive inhibition was observed when glucosinolate degradation products, glutathione conjugates, sugars and dhurrin (a cyanogenic glucoside), and amino acids were included in the uptake reaction mixtures (Fig.7). The equal ability of glucosinolates with structurally very different side chains to compete for uptake of radiolabeled p-OHBG indicates that many, if not all, glucosinolates share the same carrier.Figure 7Study of competitive inhibition of uptake of radiolabeled p-OHBG by different compounds.∼105 protoplasts in 10 mm MES-Tris uptake buffer, pH 5.5, were incubated with 2.5 μCi of [14C]p-OHBG (1.7 μmol) in the presence of different compounds in concentrations corresponding to 1 or 10 times the concentration of [14C]p-OHBG at 25 °C for 15 min and stopped by filtration through silicone oil.A, glucosinolate degradation products; B,glutathione conjugates; C, sugars and dhurrin (a cyanogenic glucoside); and D, amino acids.

A slight uptake stimulation of ∼26% was observed after the addition of fusicoccin (a toxin that activates plasma membrane H+-ATPase), and the H+-ATPase inhibitors Na3VO4, DCCD, and DES inhibited p-OHBG uptake. This indicates that the uptake is dependent on a functional H+-ATPase. Inhibitors associated with ATP metabolism such as arsenite, KCN, and NaN3 interfered with the uptake, which indicates that the uptake is dependent on energy. CCCP, which dissipates pH gradient, strongly reduced the transport, indicating that the uptake requires a proton motive force. The inhibitory effect of the impermeable sulfhydryl group modifier PCMBS on glucosinolate transporter was relieved by the inclusion of 5 mm DTT in the incubation medium.Table IEffects of the presence of various compounds on uptake of p-OHBG by leaf protoplasts of B. napusTreatmentConcentrationp-OHBG uptake%mmnmol/μl/hControl3.6 ± 0.5100Fusicoccin0.0024.5 ± 0.6125.7Na3VO40.20.7 ± 0.720.4DCCD0.52.2 ± 0.262.7DES0.12.4 ± 0.266.4Arsenite0.50.9 ± 0.125.3KCN21.5 ± 0.141.3NaN321.9 ± 0.352.7CCCP0.010.9 ± 0.225.1PCMBS10.6 ± 0.315.6PCMBS + DTT53.5 ± 1.097.6Protoplasts were preincubated with various compounds for 30 min.

In the present paper, we have measured uptake of radiolabeledp-OHBG in protoplasts isolated from leaves of B. napus using the silicone oil filtration technique (23Borstlap A.C. Kuyper-Vos A.A. Schuurmans J. Plant Sci. 1987; 48: 55-62Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 24Fieuw S. Willenbrink J. Plant Sci. 1991; 76: 9-17Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Ritte G. Rosenfeld J. Rohrig K. Raschke K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the uptake indicates the presence of a glucosinolate/H+ symporter. Uptake of glucosinolates has previously been shown in vivoin excised embryos from B. napus (18Gijzen M. McGregor I. Seguin-Swartz G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Gijzen M. Seguin-Swartz G. McGregor I. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 144: 17-21Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In order to characterize the mechanism for glucosinolate transporter at the plasma membrane, we have developed a method for measuring uptake of glucosinolates in isolated leaf protoplasts. Compared with intact tissues, protoplasts are single living cells where the plasma membrane is in direct contact with glucosinolates without any diffusional barriers. This allows for more rapid and sensitive kinetic studies as compared with studies using intact tissues. In comparison, the use of plasma membrane vesicles has the advantage of providing well defined membrane potentials and pH gradients for electrophysiological studies, albeit in an in vitro system. In the biochemical characterization of the glucosinolate transport system, we determined a high Q 10 of 1.8 for p-OHBG accumulation. In the case of passive physical absorption, the Q 10 value should be low, normally around 1.0 (26Donaldson T.W. Bayer D.E. Leonard O.A. Plant Physiol. 1973; 52: 638-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Blackman M.S. McDaniel C.N. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 261-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretically, a solute must be neutrally charged and lipid-soluble in order to diffuse passively across a membrane. Due to the low pKa value (∼2) of the sulfonic acid group, glucosinolates invariably occur in nature in the anionic form (34Larsen P.O. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 501-525Google Scholar). The presence of a glucose and a sulfonate moiety categorizes glucosinolates as hydrophilic, negatively charged compounds (34Larsen P.O. Stumpf P.K. Conn E.E. The Biochemistry of Plants. 7. Academic Press, New York1981: 501-525Google Scholar), which are unlikely to cross the plasma membrane by passive diffusion. This is consistent with the measuredQ 10 value. Furthermore, we observed that the internal concentration of p-OHBG in the protoplasts after 10 min of incubation was more than 3.6-fold higher than that in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1). This indicates that p-OHBG accumulates against a concentration gradient, as also evidenced by the decrease in uptake of p-OHBG by leaf protoplasts upon the addition of CCCP (Fig. 4). Moreover, a saturable component was identified at low glucosinolate concentrations. At high glucosinolate concentrations, we observed a linear low affinity component for rape leaf protoplasts (Fig. 2), which is in contrast to the saturation level reached in rapeseed embryos at 10 mm benzylglucosinolate (glucotropaeolin) (18Gijzen M. McGregor I. Seguin-Swartz G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar nonsaturable components have been reported for sugar and amino acid uptake (32Ritte G. Rosenfeld J. Rohrig K. Raschke K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Buckhout T.J. Planta. 1989; 178: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 36McDonald R. Fieuw S. Patrick J.W.

The linear component could be a carrier-mediated diffusion pathway, a non-carrier-mediated diffusion pathway, or possibly an unspecific anion transport protein on the plasma membrane (29O'Driscoll D. Wilson G. Steer M.W. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 237-241Google Scholar). With respect to the machinery for p-OHBG uptake, the pH dependence of uptake rates (Figs. 3 and 5), the abolishment of the pH dependence by administration of CCCP (Fig. 4 and Table I), and the stimulation of uptake by H+-ATPase activator fusicoccin (Table I) indicate that glucosinolates are absorbed in symport with protons. The membrane potentials artificially imposed upon the protoplasts by addition of TPP+, K+, and NaSCN (30Marshall J. Corzo A. Leigh R.A. Sanders D. Plant J. 1994; 5: 683-694Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Pick U. Katz A. Weiss M. Avron M. Leaver C. Sze H. Plant Membrane: Structure, Function, Biogenesis. Alan R.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) contributed relatively little to the uptake of p-OHBG, which suggests that the glucosinolate uptake is not electrogenic and that the proton motive force is the primary energy source. A range of inhibitors of H+-ATPase and ATP metabolism significantly reduced the uptake of p-OHBG by leaf protoplasts, which indicates that an active carrier is involved (TableI). The inhibitory effect of PCMBS on p-OHBG uptake is strong evidence for the involvement of a component of the plasma membrane (38Williams L.E. Nelson S.J. Hall J.L. Planta. 1992; 186: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Hauser M. Donhardt A.M. Barnes D Naider F. Becker J.M. J. Biol Chem. 2000; 275: 3037-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Competition experiments with various compounds show that p-OHBG uptake activity is specific for glucosinolates (Figs. 6 and 7) and is independent of the structure of the different side chains (Fig. 6). This observation is consistent with previous studies on glucosinolate transport in vivo (16Brudenell A.J.P. Griffiths H. Rossiter J.T. Baker D.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 745-756Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Gijzen M. McGregor I. Seguin-Swartz G. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 260-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 19Gijzen M. Seguin-Swartz G. McGregor I. J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 144: 17-21Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and with in vitro studies on glucosinolate uptake with recombinant amino acid transporter and with recombinant hexose transporters (data not shown). Accordingly, several transporters of major organic solute in the plasma membrane could be excluded as candidates for p-OHBG transport. This indicates that a specific glucosinolate carrier is responsible for intercellular glucosinolate transport. Interestingly, there was no detectable glucosinolate uptake activity in the non-glucosinolate plant tobacco (Fig. 1), which indicates that the existence of glucosinolate transporter(s) is specific for glucosinolate-producing plants. The physiological role of a glucosinolate transporter in leaves of oilseed rape is unknown. A possible role could be to reabsorb glucosinolates that have leaked out of the cell, equivalent to the presence of sucrose transporters in all the cell types in source tissue (40Maynard J.W. Lucas W.J. Plant Physiol. 1982; 69: 734-739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the glucosinolate transporter might play a role in translocation of glucosinolates in the plant. Phloem mobility of radiolabeled glucosinolates has recently been demonstrated (16Brudenell A.J.P. Griffiths H. Rossiter J.T. Baker D.A. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 745-756Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), suggesting that glucosinolate translocation may play an important role in glucosinolate metabolism. In conclusion, we have provided biochemical evidence for the existence of a plasma membrane glucosinolate/H+ symporter. Cloning of the transporter is in progress, and will help to provide the necessary tools to address the question of where the transporter is expressed and what is the physiological function of the transporter. The biochemical characterization of the transporter facilitates identification at the molecular level, thus providing greater insight into the process of glucosinolate translocation in planta.

Where known, component and mechanistic similarity support the hypothesis that the organelle pathways are descendent from those of the prokaryotic endosymbiont. This is most evident when comparing export pathways of chloroplasts and bacteria. Chloroplasts share with bacteria at least four distinct pathways: a Sec pathway, a ΔpH/Tat1 pathway, a signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway, and a spontaneous insertion pathway (2Keegstra K.

The ΔpH pathway was first described as a system that transported a subset of thylakoid lumenal proteins using only the thylakoidal ΔpH as an energy source (6Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrates of this pathway possess cleavable, amino-terminal signal peptides with an invariant twin arginine motif amino-terminal to the hydrophobic core (7Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I.

A plant chloroplast TatC homologue has been identified and shown to be necessary for transport of ΔpH pathway substrates in vitro. 2H. Mori, E. J. Summer, V. Fincher, and K. Cline, manuscript in preparation. Recent studies from several laboratories indicate that the ΔpH and Tat systems do not employ components of the Sec system and vice versa(15Santini C.L. Ize B.

An intriguing question is why two pathways, Sec and ΔpH/Tat, co-evolved to target proteins to the same location. One possible explanation is that unique capabilities of each system match the translocation problems of the respective substrates. For example, substrates of the ΔpH and Tat pathways appear unable to utilize the Sec pathways, even when provided with a Sec signal peptide (8Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J.

Joly J.C. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Conversely, the Sec pathway is able to recognize transmembrane domains and integrate them into the lipid bilayer, whereas previously identified ΔpH pathway precursors are extrinsic proteins, suggesting that the ΔpH pathway might be unable to insert membrane proteins. In this paper, we present evidence that the ΔpH pathway can integrate membrane proteins. Pftf is an integral thylakoid membrane protein and a AAA family member related to mitochondrial and bacterial zinc-dependent proteases, e.g. FtsH, that chaperone protein biogenesis (24Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Pftf precursor has two hydrophobic segments, similar to other FtsH homologues (Fig. 1). However, the first hydrophobic segment (H1) of the Pftf precursor is relatively short, like a signal peptide and is preceded by a twin arginine. In fact, all known plant chloroplast Pftf homologues possess an RRXFLK motif (25Summer E.J. Cline K. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1147Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a conserved motif among bacterial Tat pathway precursors (10Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Pftf is integrated into thylakoid membranes with characteristics indistinguishable from other ΔpH pathway substrates. Pftf integration required only the thylakoidal ΔpH as energy source. It was competed by overexpressed precursor substrates of the ΔpH pathway and inhibited by antibodies to components of the ΔpH pathway. Furthermore, Pftf integration was blocked in hcf106 null mutant chloroplasts. Nevertheless, Pftf integration does not strictly require the typical targeting elements of the ΔpH pathway, as they are currently understood. Evidence for this conclusion is that substitution of KK for the signal peptide RR did not change integration characteristics. Surprisingly, deleting the entire signal peptide did not alter integration characteristics of the resulting mPftf, including its competition by ΔpH precursors and inhibition by antibodies to Hcf106 and Tha4. Thus, Pftf lacking the ΔpH targeting elements still requires components of the ΔpH machinery for insertion. These results significantly expand the substrate range of the ΔpH pathway and suggest a re-evaluation of the nature of the ΔpH pathway and the cis elements thought to govern its targeting. Plasmids for pPftf (pepper), pLHCP, pOE17 (maize), iOE23 (pea), pOE33 and iOE33 (wheat), and pPSII-T (cotton) used for in vitro transcription and translation have been described (8Henry R.

The sequence of Pftf, originally reported by Hugueney et al. (29Hugueney P. Bouvier F. Badillo A. d'Harlingue A. Kuntz M. Camara B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5630-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was amended and can be found at GenBankTM accession number AJ012165. Cloning and analysis of DNA products were by standard molecular biology procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Deletion clones of pPftf were constructed by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using the cloned pPftf as template. The forward primer for synthesis of mPftf was 5′-CTCACAATGGCTGATGAGCAAGGTGTTTCTAACTCAAGGTTGTCT-3′, which gave an amino-terminal sequence of MADEQGVSNSRLSYSI. Besides adding an initiator methionine to the predicted amino terminus, the methionine at position 12 of the mature protein was changed to leucine to prevent internal initiation in vitro. The reverse primer for amplifying mPftf was 5′-GTTCAGGGTCTGTTCTCTTTCATC-3′. pKKPftf was constructed by splicing by overlap extension-PCR (31Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) in which the internal primers contained sequences to modify arginine residues 60 and 61 of pPftf to lysines. The internal forward primer was 5′-CGGATGAAGGAAAAAAGGCTTTCTTAAATTATTG-3′ and the reverse primer was the exact complement of the forward primer. The flanking forward and reverse primers, used for the second round of PCR, were 5′-AAGAGCTCATATGGCTACTTCATCAG-3′ and the above reverse primer used for mPftf amplification, respectively. mKK Pftf was constructed by SOE-PCR with mPftf (above) as template. The forward internal primer 5′-CTTTTCCTGCTATCAAAGAAGTCTAACGGAGG-3′ and reverse internal primer 5′-CCTCCGTTAGACTTCTTTGATAGCAGGAAAAG-3′ contained sequences to modify the two arginines carboxyl proximal to the membrane anchor (H2) to two lysines. All PCR products were digested with EcoICRI and XhoI and ligated into the EcoICRI/XhoI-digested pPftf plasmid and transformed into XLI-Blue (Stratagene) cells, and the resulting clones were sequenced entirely on both strands by the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research DNA sequencing core. In vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega) and translation with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) or coupled transcription/translation with wheat germ TnT (Promega) in the presence of [3H]leucine (NEN Life Science Products) was performed following the manufacture's guidelines. Unless otherwise stated, translation products were diluted with one volume of 60 mm leucine in 2× import buffer (1× = 50 mm HEPES, KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sorbitol) prior to use. Chloroplasts were isolated from 9 to 10-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum cv. Laxton's Progress 9) as described (32Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maize plants were grown at 26 °C in a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle for 7–10 days. Mutant hcf106 mum3 maize seedlings were selected by their pale green phenotype and confirmed by high chlorophyll fluorescence with a hand-held UV lamp. Maize chloroplasts were isolated by essentially the same procedure as pea chloroplasts except that intact chloroplasts were purified on a step density gradient consisting of 8 ml of 75% Percoll and 15 ml of 35% Percoll in GR buffer. The gradients were centrifuged at 3200 × g for 15 min, and intact chloroplasts were collected at the 35%/75% interface. Chloroplast lysate, washed thylakoids, and stromal extract were prepared from intact chloroplasts as described (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Import of precursors into chloroplasts was as described (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly,in vitro translated precursors were incubated with intact chloroplasts (0.33 mg chlorophyll/ml) and 5 mm MgATP in import buffer at 25 °C in a light bath (70 microeinstein/m2/s) for the times indicated in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by the addition of translation products equivalent to one-sixth the assay volume and terminated by transfer to an ice bath. Intact chloroplasts were recovered, with or without protease treatment, by centrifugation through a 35% Percoll cushion. For fractionation, recovered chloroplasts were lysed by resuspension in 20 mm Hepes, KOH, pH 8, and incubation on ice for 5 min. The thylakoid membranes were separated from the stromal fraction by centrifugation for 8 min at 3200 × g.Thylakoids were either washed with import buffer, extracted with 0.1m NaOH, or treated with thermolysin as described (32Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that for protease treatment, samples were resuspended in import buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml thermolysin for 60 min at 4 °C followed by washing in import buffer containing 50 mm EDTA. Assays for protein translocation into isolated thylakoids were essentially as described (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Assays contained 0.33 mg/ml chlorophyll equivalent of thylakoids, lysate, or reconstituted lysate, 1/6 volume radiolabeled translation product, and where indicated, 5 mmMgATP. Reaction mixtures were incubated for the indicated times at 25 °C in the presence or absence (foil-wrapped tubes) of light. Reactions were terminated by transfer to 0 °C, and the thylakoids were either washed in import buffer plus 10 mmMgCl2, extracted with 0.1 m NaOH, or treated with thermolysin as described above. Competition for integration into isolated thylakoids was performed essentially as described (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli-expressed tOE23 were dissolved in fresh 10 murea, 10 mm dithiothreitol to 90 μm protein for 3 h at room temperature, diluted to appropriate 3× stocks in 0.5 m urea, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, import buffer plus 10 mm MgCl2, and added to otherwise complete reaction mixtures. All reactions contained 0.33 mg of chlorophyll/ml of chloroplast lysate, 5 mm MgATP, radiolabeled translation product, 0.167 m urea, and 0.16 mm dithiothreitol in import buffer plus 10 mmMgCl2. Reactions were started immediately after the addition of competitor by incubation at 25 °C for 20 min in the light. The assays were terminated by the addition of nigericin and valinomycin (0.5 and 1.0 μm final concentration, respectively) and transferred to ice. Recovered thylakoids were then protease-treated. In organello competition was conducted essentially as described (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies of pOE23 or pOE33 were dissolved in fresh 10 m urea, 10 mm dithiothreitol for 3 h at room temperature. Chloroplasts in import buffer plus 5 mm MgATP were preincubated with unlabeled competitors for 7 min in the light at 25 °C. Competitors were aliquotted from stocks, such that the final competitor concentration was 0.75 μmpOE23, 0.6 μm pOE33, or no competitor, and the urea concentration was 0.25 m in all assays. Radiolabeled precursors (1/6 volume) were then added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. Competition assays were stopped by adding an equal volume of 1.5 μm nigericin and 3 μm valinomycin in import buffer and transferred to ice. Chloroplasts were then repurified by centrifugation through Percoll cushions. Integration assays were conducted in the presence of apyrase by pretreatment of thylakoids, lysate, and translation products with 0.04 units apyrase/ml as described (6Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Import and integration assays were conducted in the presence of ionophores nigericin and valinomycin at 0.5 μm and 1.0 μm final concentration, respectively, as described (6Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoids were treated with anti-maize Hcf106 and anti-pea Tha4 IgGs in the presence or absence of antigens as described (17Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were treated with anti-pea Hcf106 and anti-pea plant chloroplast TatC homologue as described (17Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).2 Chlorophylls were determined according to Arnon (33Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified using the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Immunoblotting was by the ECL method as described (17Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Unless indicated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Upon incubation with chloroplasts, the 74-kDa Pftf precursor (pPftf) (Fig.2, lane 1) was imported into the organelles and processed to an ∼65-kDa protein (mPftf) that was protected from protease treatment of the intact chloroplasts (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 3). Upon subfractionation of the chloroplasts following import, mPftf was found exclusively in the thylakoid fraction (lane 5). It was resistant to extraction with 0.1m NaOH, demonstrating that it was integrally associated with the bilayer (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 5 and 7) and partially degraded by protease treatment of thylakoids (lane 6), resulting in an ∼13-kDa degradation product (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). These characteristics are identical to those previously determined for the endogenous protein of chromoplast internal membranes and pea thylakoid membranes (28 and data not shown). Furthermore, they indicate that the ∼13-kDa protease resistant fragment is a suitable indicator of properly integrated Pftf. If pPftf possesses a bipartite transit peptide consisting of a stromal targeting domain followed by a lumen-targeting signal peptide (Fig.1), then pPftf would be processed in two steps, first by a stromal processing protease to form a species intermediate in size, and second by a thylakoidal protease to generate mPftf. Two lines of evidence support this model. The first is the result of conducting a chloroplast import assay in the presence of ionophores that dissipate the proton motive force. Chloroplast protein import requires ATP, but not ion or pH gradients, whereas most thylakoid translocation is stimulated by the thylakoidal pH gradient (see Ref. 2Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). When pPftf was incubated with chloroplasts, ATP, and ionophores, it accumulated in chloroplasts as a protein slightly larger than mPftf (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 8 and 7). This intermediate-sized Pftf (iPftf) was predominantly associated with thylakoids, but it was not integrated into the membrane because it was largely extracted by 0.1m NaOH (Fig. 2 A, lane 13, compare with lane 7) and degraded by protease treatment (Fig.2 B, lane 3). These characteristics are similar to those of lumenal proteins previously shown to localize by a two-step pathway, except that lumenal intermediates generally accumulate in the stromal fraction (e.g. see Ref. 26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A second line of evidence is that pPftf was processed by clarified stromal extract to a species intermediate in size (data not shown) and processed by washed thylakoids to mPftf (see Fig. 3). These data support the idea that the H1 domain of pPftf is a signal peptide that is removed upon integration into thylakoids and that the mature sized mPftf has a single transmembrane anchor and a lumenal tail. Additional evidence for this point will be presented below. Preliminary results demonstrated that pPftf integrates into isolated thylakoids in a ΔpH-dependent manner. This suggested that Pftf employs the ΔpH pathway for integration. One means of addressing whether Pftf is using the ΔpH pathway is to modify the cis topogenic elements for ΔpH pathway targeting. The two arginines just prior to H1 in pPftf were replaced with two lysines (Fig. 1; pKKPftf). As a more severe test, the entire signal peptide of pPftf was removed producing mPftf. These modified Pftf proteins were assayed with intact chloroplasts as well as with isolated thylakoids. As expected, pKKPftf was imported into isolated chloroplasts (Fig.3 A, lanes 7 and 8), but mPftf remained on the outside of the chloroplasts where it was degraded by protease (Fig. 3 A, lanes 12 and 13). Imported pKKPftf became integrally associated with the thylakoid membranes, similar to pPftf, as determined by resistance to extraction with NaOH and by the production of the characteristic 13-kDa degradation product following lysis of the chloroplasts and protease treatment of the membranes (Fig.3 A, lanes 9 and 10 compare with lanes 4 and 5). This indicates that the twin arginine motif is not essential for Pftf integration. The ability of pKKPftf and mPftf to integrate into isolated thylakoid membranes was also examined. When incubated with washed thylakoids (Fig. 3 B), pKKPftf was processed to mature size and became integrally associated with thylakoids as judged by resistance to extraction with NaOH, similar to pPftf (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6 and 7). mPftf was also integrated into washed thylakoids (lanes 8 and 9) and produced the 13-kDa protease degradation product (Fig. 3 C, lane 5), which was further resistant to base extraction, indicating that it was anchored in the membrane (Fig. 3 C, lane 6). These data indicate that Pftf does not require the signal peptide for membrane targeting or integration. A time course of integration determined that mPftf integrates into washed thylakoids at approximately the same rate as pPftf, whereas pKKPftf integrates at only about 50% the rate of pPftf (data not shown). To assess whether pKKPftf and mPftf utilize the same mechanism for integration as pPftf, the stromal and energetic requirements of pKKPftf and mPftf were determined in simultaneous assays with pPftf, pOE17, and iOE33 (Fig.4). Like pPftf integration (Fig.4 A), pKKPftf (Fig. 4 B) and mPftf (Fig.4 C) integration did not require stromal factors (lanes 2 and 7) or ATP (lanes 3 and 7). Integration was dependent on the proton motive force as it was inhibited by ionophores in the light (lane 6) and was ATP-dependent in the dark (lanes 4 and 5), i.e. via reverse action of the ATP synthase (6Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another experiment, the proton motive force requirement of Pftf was further dissected by conducting assays in the presence of increasing levels of nigericin or valinomycin separately. The protonophore nigericin inhibited Pftf integration, whereas the electrogenic ionophore valinomycin had no effect on Pftf integration at levels as high as 1 μm (data not shown). This indicates that it is the ΔpH component of the proton motive force, rather than the ΔΨ component, that is required for Pftf integration. Thus all forms of Pftf assayed exhibited the identical translocation requirement, a pH gradient but not ATP, similar to the ΔpH substrate pOE17 (Fig. 4 D) and very different from the Sec pathway substrate iOE33 (Fig. 4 E). Considering the fact that all three Pftf constructs still required only a pH gradient for translocation, it was important to subject them to other criteria used to assess utilization of the ΔpH pathway. Previous studies (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) established conditions by which saturating concentrations of unlabeled overexpressed precursors competed for translocation of precursors employing the same pathway. Fig. 5 shows the results of two competition experiments. In Fig. 5 A, translocation into isolated thylakoids was competed with E. coli-produced tOE23, an efficient substrate of the ΔpH pathway (8Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Insertion of pPftf was partially competed by tOE23 (lanes 3–5). Interestingly, mPftf integration was much more strongly competed; elevated concentrations of tOE23 virtually eliminated mPftf integration. The response of the controls, pOE17 for the ΔpH pathway and iOE33 for the Sec pathway, verified the specificity of this competitor. Competition experiments were also carried out in organello,wherein competition for thylakoid translocation occurs within intact chloroplasts. In these assays, competitive precursors are imported into the chloroplasts at a rate much faster than thylakoid transport, allowing saturating levels of intermediates to accumulate. In organello competition more closely represents physiological conditions as all competing intermediates have first been imported across the plastid envelope and are completely competent for thylakoid transport (26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The results of in organello competition of pPftf and pKKPftf are shown in Fig. 5 B. Competition with the ΔpH pathway precursor pOE23 inhibited Pftf integration as evidenced by the accumulation of about 50% of the imported Pftf as iPftf (lanes 5–7). A significant percentage of iPftf accumulated in the stromal fraction (lane 6). pOE23 competition of pKKPftf virtually eliminated thylakoid integration and nearly all of the resulting iKKPftf accumulated in the stroma (lanes 5–7). Interestingly, iKKPftf also accumulated in the stroma when thylakoid integration was blocked with ionophores (lanes 11–13). As can be seen, thylakoid localization of Pftf and KKPftf was unaffected by the Sec pathway competitor pOE33 (lanes 8–10) compared with the “no competitor” control (lanes 2–4). Competition experiments with radiolabeled pOE17 and pOE33 (Fig. 5 B, lower panels) verified the efficacy and specificity of the competitors. We recently showed that antibodies to Hcf106 and Tha4, two components of the ΔpH pathway, specifically inhibit translocation of ΔpH pathway substrates but not those of the Sec or SRP pathway (17Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, antibodies to either Hcf106 (lane 2) or Tha4 (lane 5) inhibited integration of pPftf or mPftf. Inhibition was prevented by including 20 μm of the respective antigens, hcf106sd (lane 3) or tha4sd (lane 7), during the antibody-binding step. Inhibition was greater for mPftf than pPftf. The controls for this experiment, iOE23 and pPSII-T for the ΔpH pathway and pLHCP for the SRP pathway, demonstrated the specificity and efficacy of the treatments. In other experiments (data not shown), integration of pPftf, pKKPftf, and mPftf was unaffected by antibodies to cpSecY under conditions that virtually eliminated transport of Sec pathway substrates in parallel assays. Hcf106 was originally identified through genetic experiments in which mutant maize plants were specifically defective in thylakoid transport of ΔpH pathway precursor proteins both in vivo and in vitro (9Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 34Voelker R. Barkan A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3905-3914Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As an additional test of whether Pftf employs ΔpH machinery, chloroplasts were isolated from hcf106 maize seedlings and used in chloroplast import assays (Fig. 7). The hcf106 chloroplasts were devoid of the Hcf106 protein, but contained normal amounts of Tha4 (Fig. 7 B). pPftf was imported into wild type maize chloroplasts and accumulated as the integrated form, as determined by NaOH extraction (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, although pPftf was imported normally intohcf106 chloroplasts, it was not integrated into thylakoids as it was extracted from the thylakoid fraction with NaOH (Fig.7 A). In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, iPftf was not clearly resolved from mPftf. However, in other experiments, it was apparent that only iPftf accumulated in hcf106 chloroplasts, whereas it was largely mPftf that accumulated in wild type chloroplasts (data not shown). The ΔpH pathway control for this experiment, pOE17, was imported into wild type chloroplasts and accumulated normally as the mature, lumenal form, whereas it accumulated in hcf106chloroplasts primarily as the stromal intermediate iOE17 (Fig.7 A, lower panel). The Sec pathway control, pOE33, was imported and accumulated as the mature, lumenal form in both hcf106 and wild type chloroplasts (Fig. 7 A, lower panel). Examination of Pftf sequences revealed the presence of an RR flanking the hydrophobic anchor on the carboxyl side (Fig. 1). We assessed the possibility that the ΔpH machinery can recognize a twin arginine motif on either end of a hydrophobic segment by constructing a modified mPftf (mKKPftf) in which the carboxyl flanking RR was changed to KK. mKKPftf integration was analyzed in the absence or presence of ionophores and with thylakoids preincubated with antibodies to ΔpH pathway components (Fig. 8). Similar to mPftf, mKKPftf integration was prevented by dissipation of the thylakoidal pH gradient (Fig. 8, lanes 2 and 3). We recently prepared antibodies to pea Hcf106 and pea chloroplast TatC. Preincubation of thylakoids with either of these antibodies specifically inhibits the transport of ΔpH pathway substrates but does not affect the proton gradient.2 As shown in Fig. 8, either antibody inhibited mPftf or mKKPft integration (lanes 5 and 7). Specificity of the antibody effect is evident by the lack of effect of pre-immune IgGs (lanes 4) and prevention of antibody inhibition by co-incubation with the corresponding antigens (lanes 6 and 8). In addition, parallel assays verified the lack of effect of antibodies on transport of the Sec pathway substrate OE33 and the SRP pathway substrate LHCP (data not shown). In this work we analyzed Pftf integration into thylakoids and found that it employs the ΔpH pathway machinery. This is the first membrane protein found to be a substrate for the ΔpH pathway; all other known substrates are soluble proteins of the thylakoid lumen. Several lines of evidence argue for this conclusion. First Pftf integration did not require stromal factors and relied entirely on the pH gradient as an energy source for integration (Fig. 4). Second, integration was competed by saturating quantities of ΔpH pathway precursors but not by Sec pathway precursors (Fig. 5). Third, antibodies to the ΔpH machinery specifically inhibited Pftf integration (Figs. 6 and 8). Finally, hcf106 mutant chloroplasts were unable to integrate Pftf into thylakoids, even though they efficiently imported the precursor into the organelle (Fig. 7). These results indicate that, like the Sec system, the ΔpH pathway can distinguish between segments of hydrophilic peptide to be completely transported to the lumen and segments of hydrophobic peptide to be released into the bilayer. One surprising and novel feature of Pftf integration is that it required neither the RR motif of the signal peptide nor even the hydrophobic core domain. pKKPftf integrated faithfully into thylakoids (Figs. 3 and 4) and exhibited all of the hallmarks of ΔpH pathway translocation. mPftf, which lacks the entire signal peptide, was similarly integrated into thylakoids by the ΔpH pathway (Figs. 3 and4). Nevertheless, several observations indicate that the RR motif and the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide contribute to efficient integration. pKKPftf integrated into isolated thylakoids with only ∼50% of the efficiency of pPftf. Although mPftf exhibited the same rate of integration into isolated thylakoids, as did pPftf, other characteristics demonstrate a weaker interaction with the ΔpH pathway machinery. For example, mPftf and pKKPftf were competed by lower concentrations of overexpressed ΔpH pathway precursors than pPftf (Fig. 5). Because effective concentrations for competition are related to Km values of the competing substrates, this indicates that mPftf and pKKPftf interact with ΔpH pathway machinery more weakly than pPftf. In support of this conclusion, when pKKPftf was imported into chloroplasts under conditions that prevented integration, iKKPftf accumulated in the stroma, rather than bound to the membrane surface as did iPftf (Fig. 5 B). We interpret these data to mean that the RR-containing signal peptide of pPftf promotes a strong interaction with the ΔpH pathway machinery but is not essential for integration. This differs from previous analyses of lumenal protein substrates, where conservative substitution of the RR eliminates transport (7Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klosgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffery M. Ma X. Cline K. J.

Studies of the bacterial Tat pathway have shown that conservative substitution of a single arginine of some substrates reduces but does not eliminate transport (11Niviere V. Wong S.L. Voordouw G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 2173-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol.

However, this is the first example where deleting the entire signal peptide did not eliminate translocation. The fact that mPftf integrates with a reasonable efficiency suggests the presence of a second targeting signal. This could be a redundant signal that serves to simply increase the interaction of the precursor with the machinery or it might be a cryptic signal that is unmasked by deletion of the signal peptide. The most likely second signal is the H2 membrane anchor of Pftf, which presumably would promote translocation of the amino terminus into the lumen (N-tail translocation). Interestingly, chloroplast Pftf proteins possess conserved twin arginines flanking H2 on the carboxyl proximal side. Although RR has never been shown to function on the carboxyl side of a hydrophobic core, we examined integration of a modified mPftf in which the RR was replaced with two lysines. mKKPftf was still integrated into thylakoids by the ΔpH pathway (Fig. 8). Thus, the role of H2 in targeting remains to be dissected in future studies. We also considered the possibility that the mPftf-targeting element allows Pftf to access another translocation pathway that conceivably shares ΔpH pathway components. Antibody inhibition experiments argued against the involvement of the Sec translocon. The fact that mPftf must translocate a large N-tail to the lumen suggested that the chloroplast Oxa1p homologue might be involved. In mitochondria, Oxa1p has been shown to facilitate N-tail translocation of moderately sized amino-flanking peptides across the inner membrane (5Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A.

Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, recent experiments in our lab did not find an effect of antibodies to cpOxa1p on mPftf integration. 3E. J. Summer, H. Mori, and K. Cline, unpublished results. We therefore conclude that the ΔpH protein transport system is an exceptionally versatile translocation system, i.e. it can transport signal peptide-containing precursors, large folded polypeptide domains, and large, charged N-tails. In addition to significantly expanding the range of known capabilities of the ΔpH system, our studies refocus attention on the puzzling multiplicity of export systems across prokaryote-derived membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2024927131,"The Rho GTPase, Cdc42, regulates a wide variety of cellular activities including actin polymerization, focal complex assembly, and kinase signaling. We have identified a new family of very small Cdc42-binding proteins, designated SPECs (for SmallProtein Effector of Cdc42), that modulates these regulatory activities. The two human members, SPEC1 and SPEC2, encode proteins of 79 and 84 amino acids, respectively. Both contain a conserved N-terminal region and a centrally located CRIB (Cdc42/Rac InteractiveBinding) domain. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we found that both SPECs interact strongly with Cdc42, weakly with Rac1, and not at all with RhoA. Transfection analysis revealed that SPEC1 inhibited Cdc42-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in COS1 cells in a manner that required an intact CRIB domain. Immunofluorescence experiments in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts demonstrated that both SPEC1 and SPEC2 showed a cortical localization and induced the formation of cell surface membrane blebs, which was not dependent on Cdc42 activity. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that SPEC1 altered Cdc42-induced cell shape changes both in COS1 cells and in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and that this alteration required an intact CRIB domain. These results suggest that SPECs act as novel scaffold molecules to coordinate and/or mediate Cdc42 signaling activities.

Cdc42 influences membrane trafficking (1Kroschewski R Hall A Mellman I. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), cytokinesis (2Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A Hall A Glotzer M. Curr.

Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdc42 is best known for controlling the formation of filopodia, thin actin-containing structures that protrude from the cell surface (4Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). In addition to the direct effect of Cdc42 on filopodia formation, Cdc42 can also induce cross-activation of Rac, leading to membrane ruffling (5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). This cross-talk among small GTPases may function to coordinate the formation and dismantling of different cortical actin structures, such as filopodia, ruffles, lamellopodia, and membrane blebs, often seen during cell migration (6Stossel T.P. Science. 1993; 260: 1086-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). The ability of Cdc42 to influence these diverse activities stems from its interactions with a large number of different kinase and non-kinase effector proteins. Although GTP-bound Cdc42 usually interacts with downstream effector proteins containing the conserved binding motif called a CRIB1 domain (7Burbelo P. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), some downstream Cdc42 effector proteins such as IQGAP do not contain CRIB domains (8Hart M.J.

The first four of these families are kinases. The most extensively studied Cdc42 effector proteins, the PAK kinases (3Johnson D.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 54-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), participate in the Cdc42-mediated cytoskeleton rearrangements that lead to cell motility (19Sells M.A. Boyd J.J. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). PAK kinases also activate the JNK and p38 stress kinase pathways (20Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). MRCK kinases affect actin/myosin reorganization by phosphorylating non-muscle myosin light chain (12Leung T. Chen X. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Less is known about the signaling pathways and cellular processes affected by ACK tyrosine kinases, but they may influence cell adhesion signals (24Yang W. Lin Q. Guan J.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). WASP and a related protein, N-WASP, comprise a family of non-kinase CRIB-containing proteins that function in actin polymerization (15Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 16Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). N-WASP regulates filopodia formation by producing free actin filaments either via its cofilin actin-severing domain (16Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) or through interactions with the actin-severing protein, profilin (27Suetsugu S. Miki H. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6516-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Both WASP and N-WASP also positively regulate the ARP2/3 protein complex, which stimulates actin nucleation (28Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 29Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The other non-kinase, CRIB-containing set of Cdc42 effector proteins, is the MSE55/CEP/BORG family, which is the most structurally diverse. This family, consisting of five members, all induce long actin-containing cellular extensions in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (17Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). With so many different Cdc42 effector proteins, many of which may coexist in a single cell, competition and/or some mechanism for coordination must exist to ensure that the proper Cdc42 signal is propagated. Although many individual Cdc42 effector proteins have been studied, little is known about how these effector proteins cooperate and/or compete with each other, either in regulating the cytoskeleton or in kinase signaling. Here, we have identified a novel family of Cdc42 effector proteins that may play a role in this higher level of coordination. This new family, designated SPEC (for SmallProtein Effector of Cdc42) has two human members, SPEC1 and SPEC2. Both are very small and are highly conserved. SPECs appear to have multifaceted activities, of which some are independent of Cdc42 binding and some are dependent on Cdc42 binding. For instance, expression of SPECs in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts induced membrane blebbing. SPEC-induced blebbing did not require Cdc42 activity because blebbing still occurred with a CRIB domain mutant of SPEC or in the presence of dominant negative Cdc42. SPEC1 blocked both Cdc42-induced JNK activity and altered Cdc42-induced morphology changes in COS1 cells and in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts in a manner that required an intact CRIB domain and, thus, was dependent on Cdc42 binding. Together these results suggest that SPECs act as novel scaffold molecules to coordinate and/or mediate Cdc42 signaling activities. Clones of SPEC1 were identified from a TBLASTN search of the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the 16-amino acid CRIB core sequence of MSE55 (7Burbelo P. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) (ISHPLGDFRHTMHVGR) as a query. Several of these human EST clones were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium (clone ID numbers: 257442, 139233, 160147) and sequenced on an Applied Biosystem 377 DNA sequencer. The GenBank™ accession number of SPEC1 is AF187845. Furthermore, EST clones for human and mouse SPEC1 are quite abundant and are represented by the NCBI Unigene identifiers Hs.22065 and Mm.28189, respectively. Additional TBLASTN searches of the non-redundant nucleotide data base using the amino acid sequence of SPEC1 as query identified three well separated DNA sequences that if transcribed as a single mRNA and properly spliced might encode a second SPEC-like protein. Two adapter-primers, 5′-GAGGGATCCAGTGAATTCTGGTTGTGT-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGAGCTATCCCGCCTTCGTATC-3′, derived from these genomic sequences and corresponding to each end of the putative coding sequence, were synthesized. These two primers were used in reverse transcription-PCR with MCF-7 breast cancer cell RNA as template. After PCR, an approximately 250-base pair PCR fragment was obtained, cut with BamHI/XhoI, and subcloned into the BamHI-XhoI site of pCAF2, a mammalian expression vector (17Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing revealed that the nucleotide sequence of this PCR product was, as expected, derived from the three different 5q31 genomic fragments and encodes a protein, designated SPEC2, that was quite similar to SPEC1. SPEC2 has GenBank™ accession numberAF189692. The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed in the Y190 yeast strain using the pYTH GAL4 DNA binding domain yeast vector and pACT-II GAL4 activation domain yeast vectors (30Aspenstrom P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). cDNAs for SPEC1 (amino acids 2–79) or SPEC2 (amino acids 2–84) were subcloned downstream of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in pYTH-9, and integrated strains were generated as described (30Aspenstrom P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of SPEC1 consisting of amino acids 2–27 (SPEC1-del1) or amino acids 48–79 (SPEC1-del2) were constructed in the same way. Wild type and activated mutants of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho were subcloned downstream of the GAL4 activation domain in pACT-II. Protein-protein interactions were detected by assaying for β-galactosidase activity in a filter assay or by growth on nutrient agar plates lacking histidine (30Aspenstrom P. Lindberg U. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 70-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of SPEC1 was amplified by PCR from the I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone (ID 22978) using the two primers 5′-GAGGGATCCAGTGAATTTTGGCACAAAC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCGAGCTATAAGCCCCTAGAATTG-3′. This PCR product was then subcloned in-frame into the BamHI-XhoI sites downstream of an N-terminal myc epitope-tagged pcDNA-III (Invitrogen) or an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged pCAF2 mammalian expression vector. An additional C-terminal myc epitope-tagged SPEC1 construct was constructed in the pcDNA-III mammalian expression vector. Untagged SPEC1 constructs were also constructed using the bicistronic enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) vector (CLONTECH). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Several SPEC1 mutant constructs were generated from the epitope-tagged constructs by using SPEC1 sequence-specific oligonucleotides and the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Four single or multiple SPEC1 point mutants containing alanine substitutions in the N terminus (SPEC1-C10A,C11A), the CRIB domain (SPEC1-H38A and SPEC1-P35A,H38A,H41A) or in the C terminus (SPEC1-Q62A,K64A) were constructed. The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of these mutants and their parent constructs had approximately similar levels of expression in transfected cells as judged by immunofluorescence. COS1 cells were used to examine whether SPEC influenced JNK kinase activation using ATF-2 as substrate as described (31Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of DNA were used in each transfection. Immunofluorescence of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts was performed essentially as described (17Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) except that LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were fixed and permeabilized on glass coverslips coated with polylysine. Coverslips were stained with the myc and FLAG anti-epitope primary antibodies including mouse anti-FLAG™ M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-FLAG™/Octaprobe antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), Texas Red anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and FITC-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit (Rockland Immunochemicals) were used as secondary antibodies. Texas Red-conjugated Phalloidin (Sigma) was used to stain F-actin. Nuclear and phosphotidylserine staining was also performed using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) and annexin-V (Trevigen, Inc.), respectively. Blebbing cells were quantified in vector alone and in SPEC-ransfected cells 24 h post-ransfection. Cells with two or more outpouchings were scored as positive for membrane blebbing. Fifty to one hundred cells were scored from each of at least three independent transfections. A Zeiss Photomicroscope III equipped with a Planapo 63X/1.4 NA phase 3 objective was used, and photographs were taken with Kodak TMAX400 film using a Nikon N6006 camera. Most known Cdc42-inding proteins contain a conserved core domain, the CRIB domain (7Burbelo P. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). We looked for additional proteins that might bind Cdc42 by searching the human EST data base for sequences similar to the CRIB domain of the non-kinase Cdc42 effector protein MSE55/CEP1 (17Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and identified many cDNAs encoding the same small protein. The DNA sequences of several independent human clones comprising a contig spanning 1.8 kilobases each showed an open reading frame of 79 amino acid residues, which we designated SPEC1 (Fig.1). These cDNAs encoding the SPEC1 protein contained a Kozak consensus sequence and an upstream in-frame stop codon and did not encode any proteins longer than SPEC1. A second human SPEC family member, designated SPEC2, was identified by searching the non-redundant GenBank™ data base. This search identified three short separated genomic regions from chromosome 5q31, spanning at least 28 kilobases (GenBank™ accession numbers AC001489 and AC001223) that if transcribed and properly spliced would encode a second SPEC-like protein. To clone the SPEC2 cDNA sequence, primers were designed for the two extreme ends of the genomic regions and used in reverse transcription-PCR. This approach yielded a 250-base pair PCR fragment containing an open reading frame of 84 amino acids (Fig. 1). Comparison of this sequence with 5q31 genomic sequences confirmed that the full-length SPEC2 protein was encoded in three exons spanning at least 28 kilobases. In addition to the human SPEC1 and SPEC2 proteins, we have also identified both SPEC1 and SPEC2 homologs in other organisms. We have identified SPEC1 homologs from mouse (GenBank™ AI472516) and chicken (GenBank™ AI981286) that are 96 and 83% identical to SPEC1 at the amino acid level, respectively (Fig. 1). We have also identified SPEC2 homologs from mouse (GenBank™ AW061198), rat (GenBank™ AA944330),Drosophila (AA820736), and ascidian (Halocynthia roretzi; GenBank™ AV382466) (Fig. 1). Identification of the SPEC proteins in such diverse organisms suggests their function may be conserved through evolution. SPEC1 and SPEC2 represent two members of a new protein family that are 76% similar over their entire length (Fig. 1) and encode proteins with predicted molecular masses of 7.9 kDa and 8.4 kDa, respectively. Both SPECs contain a highly conserved N-terminal region and a typical CRIB domain. The CRIB domains of the SPECs extend beyond the CRIB core sequence and contain the consensus sequence DR(S/T)MIGEP XNFVH XX H A GSGD/EAXXG, where A represents an aliphatic amino acid, and bold letters identify the CRIB core (Fig. 1). In the C terminus of both proteins there is a relatively small conserved sequence containing the nine-amino acid consensus sequence, (V/I)Q(E/N)QM(R/Q)SKG (Fig. 1). This region may be part of an extended high affinity Cdc42 binding site (32Abdul-Manan N. Aghazadeh B. Liu G.A. Majumdar A. Ouerfelli O. Siminovitch K.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 1999; 399: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D. Lowe P.N. Manser E. Lim L. Laue E.D. Nature. 1999; 399: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Since proteins containing a consensus CRIB domain will bind Cdc42 and/or Rac (7Burbelo P. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), we predicted that both SPEC1 and SPEC2 also would interact with Cdc42 and/or Rac. We tested this prediction in a yeast two-hybrid system. Both SPEC1 and SPEC2 interacted strongly with a constitutively activated mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42-Q61L), weakly with an activated mutant of Rac1 (Rac1-Q61L), and not at all with an activated mutant of RhoA (RhoA-Q63L) using both the β-galactosidase filter assay (Fig.2) and growth on selective media (data not shown). Although interaction of SPECs with wild type Cdc42 and wild type Rac1 was not observed, our results are consistent with yeast two-hybrid experiments using other CRIB-containing Cdc42 effector proteins, such as WASP (30Aspenstrom P.

Additionally, SPEC CRIB deletion mutants retaining either the N terminus (SPEC1-del1; amino acids 2–27) or the C terminus (SPEC1-del2; amino acids 48–79) were unable to bind to an activated Cdc42 mutant (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results demonstrate that SPECs can interact with Cdc42 in a CRIB-dependent fashion and suggest that SPECs may function normally in Cdc42-dependent signaling. Since a variety of studies have shown both that Cdc42 (31Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S.

First, an expression construct of human SPEC1 carrying an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag was transfected into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, and its expression was analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. Using this approach, SPEC1 was detected in lysates as an ∼8 kDa species (data not shown), of which about 1 kilobase is contributed by the epitope tag. Second, several SPEC1 mutants were constructed, including two CRIB mutants and a C-terminal double mutant. The two CRIB mutants, SPEC1-H38A and SPEC1-P33A,H38A,H41A, contain alanine substitutions within critical contact sites known to be involved in Cdc42 binding (33Mott H.R. Owen D. Nietlispach D.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). The third mutant, SPEC1-Q62A,K66A, contained mutations within the nine-amino acid region conserved between both SPEC proteins that might be part of an extended high affinity Cdc42 binding site. COS1 cells were cotransfected with the expression vectors for GFP (control) or Cdc42-Q61L, hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged JNK, and FLAG-tagged SPEC1 constructs. After 24 h, transiently expressed HA-JNK was isolated by immunoprecipitation and used for in vitro kinase assays. All SPEC1 constructs tested were not able to stimulate JNK activity on their own (Fig.3 A). Expression of Cdc42 with HA-JNK stimulated kinase activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Cotransfection of cells with wild-type SPEC1 significantly reduced the Cdc42-induced JNK activation (Fig. 3,A and B). In contrast, SPEC1-P33A,H38A,H41A or SPEC1-Q62A,K66A were markedly less effective at blocking Cdc42-induced JNK activation (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, a similar failure to block Cdc42-induced JNK activation was also observed with the single CRIB domain mutant (data not shown). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that our overexpression studies have resulted in abnormally high levels of SPEC1, which may nonspecifically inhibit Cdc42 signaling pathways, these results may also suggest that SPEC1 modulates JNK activity by binding or sequestering Cdc42 through a CRIB-dependent interaction. We next examined the cellular distribution of epitope-tagged SPEC1 expression by immunofluorescence. In COS1 cells, SPEC1 showed diffuse cytoplasmic localization (Fig.4 B). Additionally, SPEC-expressing cells did not show altered actin structures or cell morphology (data not shown). We next determined whether SPEC1 influenced Cdc42 function when co-expressed with Cdc42. COS1 cells expressing the constitutively active Cdc42-Q61L mutant exhibited a widely spread and flattened phenotype with some filopodia (Fig. 4,A and B). Cotransfection of SPEC1 with Cdc42-Q61L resulted in cells that were more elevated and much less spread than cells expressing Cdc42-Q61L alone (compare Fig. 4, C and D with A) or untransfected cells (data not shown). In contrast to what was seen with wild-type SPEC1, cells coexpressing Cdc42-Q61L and the CRIB domain mutant (SPEC1-H38A) resembled cells transfected with Cdc42-Q61L alone (compare Fig. 4,E and F with A). These results suggest that SPEC1 modifies Cdc42 function. In these experiments, SPEC1 appears to alter Cdc42 activity by binding to it via the CRIB domain. These results suggest that SPECs may function to block the interaction of Cdc42 with other effector proteins, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the observed blocking activity was due to overexpression of SPEC1 protein. Since SPEC1 expression did not noticeably alter the morphology of COS1 cells, we studied the effects of SPEC1 expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, SPEC1 displayed a predominant cortical localization (Fig.5 A), and frequently, these transfected cells showed extensive membrane blebbing (Fig.5 A). F-actin stained strongly within the periphery of the blebs but not within the blebs (Fig. 5 B). Expression of SPEC2 also showed the same cortical localization, membrane blebbing, and F-actin staining phenotype (Fig. 5, C and D). A similar pattern of cortical staining and blebbing were observed with a myc epitope tag located either at the N or C terminus of SPEC1 and using a 20-fold range of plasmid concentrations (100 ng to 2 μg; data not shown). Although this SPEC-induced membrane blebbing is morphologically similar to the membrane blebbing associated with apoptosis, there is no functional association of the SPEC-induced blebbing with apoptosis. That is, neither nuclear condensation following 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of nuclei nor annexin-V positive staining, a marker for phosphotidylserine flipping in the membrane, was observed in these transfected cells (data not shown). Quantitatively, membrane blebbing was observed in 40–60% of the FLAG epitope-tagged SPEC1 transfected cells but only in about 5% of cells expressing the vector-alone control (Fig.6). We also used a bicistronic expression vector expressing both SPEC1 and EGFP from the same vector to rule out the possibility that the epitope tags might influence SPEC function. About 40% of the cells expressing the bicistronic SPEC1 construct showed a blebbing phenotype, whereas only 10% were blebbing with the EGFP-alone vector (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that expression of SPECs, whether epitope-tagged or untagged, leads to membrane blebbing in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. To determine whether any of the three conserved regions in SPECs (see Fig.1) are necessary for SPEC1-induced membrane blebbing, we examined the phenotype of cells transfected with various SPEC1 mutants. An additional N-terminal mutant, SPEC1-C10A,C11A was created within two conserved cysteine residues because of the potential role of these residues in lipid modification or protein interactions. Using cell counting it was found that both the positive and negative controls gave the expected results: approximately 44% of N-terminal FLAG-tagged SPEC1-transfected cells blebbed, as compared with only 4% using a vector-alone control (Fig. 7). The C-terminal double point mutant, SPEC1-Q62A,K66A, had no effect on the level of blebbing (Fig. 7). In contrast, the cells expressing the N-terminal mutant (SPEC1-C10A,C11A), which showed a similar level of expression and cortical localization, produced the blebbing phenotype in only 20% of the transfected cells (Fig. 7). Single or triple amino acid substitutions within the CRIB domain of SPEC1 resulted in somewhat fewer blebs, although they still produced significantly more than the negative controls (30% versus 4%; Fig. 7). Additional studies expressing a dominant negative mutant of Cdc42 (Cdc42-T17N) alone did not induce membrane blebbing, and co-expression with SPEC1 did not block membrane blebbing (data not shown). These results support a model whereby SPEC1-induced blebbing does not occur through classical Cdc42-effector interactions and suggest that SPEC1 may act independently of Cdc42 or perhaps upstream of Cdc42 to induce membrane blebbing. These data also confirm that SPEC-induced membrane changes are not directly due to sequestration of Cdc42. To more clearly define the relationship between Cdc42 activity and SPECs, we tested the effect of SPEC1/Cdc42 co-expression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. In these fibroblasts, expression of Cdc42L61 resulted in cells that predominantly exhibited a membrane ruffling phenotype, possibly through activation of Rac signaling. We then cotransfected SPEC1 or the SPEC1-CRIB mutants (SPEC1-H38A or SPEC1-P33A,H38A,H41A) with constitutively active Cdc42 and quantified by cell counting the number of transfected cells showing a ruffling phenotype. Expression of a constitutively active Cdc42 mutant (Cdc42-Q61L), but not wild type Cdc42 (data not shown), in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts induced marked membrane ruffling in 52% of the transfected cells (Fig. 8, Aand B). Co-transfection of SPEC1 blocked ruffling in all but 5% of the transfected cells and increased the number of blebbing cells (Fig. 8, C and D). Coexpression of the SPEC-H38A mutant resulted in 34% of the cells showing a membrane ruffling phenotype (Fig. 8, E and F) and resembled cells transfected with Cdc42 alone (compare Fig. 8, A and B, with E and F). Similar results were also obtained with the SPEC1-P33A,H38A,H41A CRIB mutant (data not shown). It is also worthy to note that in these cotransfections experiments, SPEC1 and Cdc42 proteins appear to localize to similar regions within the cells, suggesting that SPECs and Cdc42 may be contained within the same signaling complexes (Fig. 8). As with COS1 cells, these transfections demonstrate that SPEC1 expression led to an altered Cdc42-induced morphology and that this alteration is dependent on the presence of an intact CRIB domain. Here we identify a new family of proteins capable of binding to Cdc42, designated SPECs, found in many eukaryotic species. The two human members, SPEC1 and SPEC2, are the smallest known GTPase-binding proteins. Their small size may explain why they were not detected in previous biochemical screens based on binding to Cdc42. Overexpression of different combinations of SPECs, SPEC mutants, and Cdc42 showed that SPEC expression inhibited Cdc42-induced JNK activity. SPEC overexpression also altered or reversed the cellular morphologies produced when Cdc42 is overexpressed in COS1 cells and in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. The membrane blebbing induced by SPEC overexpression in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts was not observed in COS1 cells, possibly due to quantitative differences in expression levels of SPEC proteins between the two cell types. Nevertheless, these results show that SPECs are capable of modifying Cdc42-dependent signaling at both the biochemical and cellular levels in a CRIB-dependent manner. SPEC binding could prevent the interaction of Cdc42 with other effector proteins. Consistent with this model, a polypeptide containing just the CRIB domain of PAK can effectively inhibit Cdc42 activation of JNK kinase (34Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar) and block transcriptional activation (35Osada S. Izawa M. Koyama T. Hirai S. Ohno S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas a polypeptide containing the CRIB domain of ACK-1 can act as a Cdc42-specific inhibitor, blocking v-Ha-Ras-induced transformation (36Nur-E-Kamal M. Kamal J. Qureshi M. Maruta H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7787-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, we do not know if the specific biochemical and biological effects observed here with overexpressed SPECs reflect the normal function of these small proteins. In particular, SPEC overexpression induced membrane blebbing in NIH-3T3 fibroblast that was not blocked by dominant negative Cdc42 expression. Despite these findings, it is still possible that SPECs function in Cdc42-induced morphological changes, since a dominant negative approach may not rescue the abnormal morphology of overexpressed SPEC protein. Furthermore, various studies have shown that non-apoptotic membrane blebs function normally in cell spreading (37Erickson C.A. Trinkaus J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 99: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 38Cunnignham C.C. J.

Mechanistically, membrane blebs occur at sites where the cortical actin is locally depolymerized or detached from the membrane (38Cunnignham C.C. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and/or focal complex assembly (43Huot J. Houle F. Rousseau S. Deschesnes R.G. Shah G.M. Landry J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1361-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that SPECs may function as classical Cdc42 effector proteins by altering the normal signaling pathways leading to actin, myosin, and/or focal complex assembly. The existence of small proteins that bind important signaling molecules is not unique to Cdc42. Recently, an 18-kDa protein, A-kinase anchoring protein-18 (AKAP18), was found to function as a scaffold protein, coupling protein kinase A signaling to calcium and sodium channels (44Fraser I.D. Tavalin S.J. Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Westphal A.M. Dean R.A. Marrion N.V. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 45Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A.

First, both are small proteins: AKAP18, SPEC1, and SPEC2 are 81, 79, and 84 amino acids long, respectively. Second, both bind their ligands, protein kinase A or Cdc42, through their central binding regions. Third, both localize to the plasma membrane. Although the membrane localization of AKAP18 involves lipid modification of the N terminus, we have not yet identified the region required to target SPECs to the membrane in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Based on these similarities, we speculate that SPECs, like AKAP18, may function as scaffolding molecules to recruit other signaling proteins to Cdc42 complexes. Future studies are aimed at identifying such SPEC-binding partners."

When activated by Ca2+, CaM binds and activates target proteins, thus altering the metabolism and physiology of the cell. Under basal conditions, calcium-free CaM binds to other proteins termed CaM-binding proteins. Recently, we described endothelial differentiation-related factor (EDF)-1 as a protein involved in the repression of endothelial cell differentiation (Dragoni, I., Mariotti, M., Consalez, G. G., Soria, M., and Maier, J. A. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 31119–31124). Here we report that (i) EDF-1 binds CaMin vitro and in vivo; (ii) EDF-1 is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by protein kinase C; and (iii) EDF-1-CaM interaction is modulated by the concentrations of Ca2+ and by the phosphorylation of EDF-1 by protein kinase C both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cell stimulates the nuclear translocation of EDF-1. On the basis of the high homology of EDF-1 with multiprotein bridging factor-1, a transcriptional coactivator that binds TATA-binding protein (TBP), we also demonstrate that EDF-1 interacts with TBP in vitro and in human endothelial cells. We hypothesize that EDF-1 serves two main functions in endothelial cells as follows: (i) to bind CaM in the cytosol at physiologic concentrations of Ca2+ and (ii) to act in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator through its binding to TBP.

Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7217) Google Scholar). The consequences of abnormal angiogenesis are either excessive or insufficient blood vessel growth. Ulcers, strokes, and heart attacks may result from the absence of angiogenesis normally required for wound healing, whereas up-regulated angiogenesis favors tumor growth and spreading, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetic retinopathy (2Folkman J N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 1757-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is initiated by vascular endothelial cells and involves their orderly migration, proliferation, and morphogenesis into a new capillary network (3Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4846) Google Scholar). Although considerable attention has been given to the mechanisms involved in the regulation of endothelial cell growth, the molecular events associated with the non-proliferative aspects of angiogenesis,i.e. the organization/differentiation of endothelial cells into capillaries, are poorly understood (4Maciag T. DeVita V. Rosenberg S. Advances in Oncology. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1990: 83-96Google Scholar). Recently, by RNA fingerprinting we isolated EDF-1,1 a novel gene product down-regulated in endothelial differentiation (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). EDF-1, which encodes a 16-kDa polypeptide, is the human homologue of the silkworm multiprotein bridging factor (MBF)-1, a transcriptional cofactor that mediates transactivation by stabilizing the protein-DNA interaction (6Takemaru K.-I. Li F.-Q. Ueda H. Hirose S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7251-7256Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a neuronal calmodulin-binding peptide, termed CAP 19, was used to recover a full-length cDNA clone from rat brain (7Smith M.L. Johanson R.A. Rogers K.E. Coleman P.D. Slemmon J.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 62: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This cDNA is the rat homologue of EDF-1. By sequence comparison, we found that the human and rat proteins possess a putative IQ domain that could mediate their binding to CaM. Indeed, calmodulin-binding proteins share a conserved region of about 20 amino acids, designated the IQ motif, that contains a CaM-binding domain and a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site (8Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The IQ motif was originally identified in neuromodulin that concentrates CaM at specific sites in neurons (9Meiri K.F. Willard M. Johnson M.I. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2571-2581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, several other proteins have been shown to possess this motif as follows: the GTPase-activating protein IQ-GAP (10Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), p68RNA helicase (11Buelt M.K. Glidden B.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27369-27377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), among others. Calmodulin, which is the classical Ca2+ receptor protein inside cells (14Means A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 44: 223-262Google Scholar), mediates calcium regulation of a number of enzymes such as adenyl cyclases, kinases, and phosphatases that are important components of signal transduction systems implicated in cell cycle progression and cytoskeletal rearrangement (15Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). In this paper, we report in vitro and in vivoevidence that EDF-1 binds calmodulin in the absence of calcium. We also demonstrate that EDF-1-CaM interaction is tightly regulated by the levels of Ca2+ and the activation of PKC both in vitro and in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first report about a protein that binds CaM and regulates its availability in endothelial cells. Interestingly, upon exposure to TPA, we can observe a dramatic increase in nuclear associated EDF-1. Moreover, native and phosphorylated EDF-1 interact with the TATA-binding protein (TBP), and EDF-1 and TBP coimmunoprecipitate in endothelial cells. HUVEC-C were from the ATCC and were cultured in HF12 containing 10% fetal calf serum, ECGF (150 μg/ml), and heparin (5 units/ml) on gelatin-coated dishes (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were designed to mutate EDF-1 by polymerase chain reaction and to clone the construct in the KpnI/BamHI sites of pQE30. To generate the single mutant Thr-91 → Asp, we used the following primers: 5′-AAG GGG CTT GAC CAG AAG GAC CTG -3′ and 5′- CAG GTC CTT CTG GTC AAG CCC CTT-3′. To mutate Thr-40 → Asp, we used the following primers: 5′-GAT GTG GAG GAT TCC AAG AAA-3′ and 5′-TTT CTT GGA ATC CTC CAC ATC-3′. To mutate Thr-58 → Asp, we used the following primers: 5′-ACC AAG AAC GAT GCC AAG CTG-3′ and 5′-CAG CTT GGC ATC GTT CTT GGT-3′. To mutate Ser-111 → Asp, we used the following primers: 5′-GAC TAT GAG GAT GGA CGG GCC-3′ and 5′-GGC CCG TCC ATC CTC ATA GTC-3′. The external primers used to generate restriction sites are 5′-CTA GGT ACC CAA GGG GAA CCG GCGG AAC-3′ and 5′-CTA GGA TCC GCC ATG GCC GAG AGC GAC-3′. Polymerase chain reaction was performed as described (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The mutants as well as the wild type protein were purified as described (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose sheets at 150 mA for 16 h, and probed with anti-EDF-1 immunopurified IgGs (0.1 μg/ml). Secondary antibodies were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The SuperSignal chemiluminescence kit (Pierce) was used to detect immunoreactive proteins (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To coimmunoprecipitate EDF-1 and other interacting proteins, HUVEC were washed, lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer, and centrifuged. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-TBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CaM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EDF-1 IgGs or nonimmune IgGs. The immunocomplexes were bound to protein G-Sepharose, extensively washed, and eluted in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, separated on SDS-PAGE. After transfer on nitrocellulose, Western blot was performed as described above using anti-EDF-1 immunopurified IgGs, anti-TBP, or anti-CaM antibodies. All the results shown were reproduced at least four time. HUVEC were seeded on gelatin-coated coverslips. When subconfluent, cells were washed and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 2% sucrose. After extensive washing, cells were permeabilized with HEPES-Triton, incubated with anti-EDF-1 immunopurified IgGs and/or goat anti-CaM IgGs, and stained with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled swine immunoglobulins against goat IgGs and rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (16Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Naldini L. Primavera M.V. Teti A. Zambonin-Zallone A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Merging of the anti-EDF-1 and anti-CaM staining were performed to coimmunolocalize the two proteins. Staining with mouse or rabbit nonimmune IgGs did not yield any significant signal. Recombinant EDF-1 was phosphorylated at 28 °C for 30 min by incubation with 10 μg/ml PKC (Upstate Biotechnology) in a final volume of 100 μl using the following reaction conditions: 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 100 μm CaCl2, 60 ng/μll-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS), 6 ng/μl diolein, and 5 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP (17Alexander K.A. Cimler B.M. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control sample was incubated in the absence of diolein, PS, and CaCl2. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed for autoradiography. Subconfluent HUVECs were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phosphate and incubated for 45 min in the same medium. The medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-free containing 50 μCi/ml carrier-free 32P to label endogenous ATP pool (18Presta M. Maier J.A.M. Ragnotti G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Then TPA (100 nm) or A23187 (1 μm) alone or in combinations were added for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by removing the medium and rapidly washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-EDF-1 antibodies as described above. EDF-1 was loaded on a CaM-agarose (Sigma) column and extensively washed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 μg of EGTA, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Elution was performed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and increasing concentrations of CaCl2 (1–5 mm) (19Lee A. Wong S.C. Gallagher D. Bin L. Storm D.R. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Eluates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blot using anti-EDF-1 IgGs as described (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PKC-phosphorylated EDF-1 and EDF-1 mutants were incubated with CaM-agarose in the aforementioned buffer, washed, centrifuged, and eluted with Laemmli buffer to be analyzed by autoradiography or Western blot, respectively. EDF-1 (100 ng/ml) and TBP (30 ng/ml, Promega) were incubated for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 60 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (20Takemaru K.-I. Harashima S. Ueda S. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4971-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The samples were then immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against TBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and blotted with anti-EDF-1 IgGs as described. To determine whether EDF-1 interacts with CaM, we loaded recombinant EDF-1 on a calmodulin-agarose column, and we eluted with buffers containing increasing concentrations of Ca2+. Fig. 1 Ashows that EDF-1 interacted with CaM and eluted with 1 and 2 mm Ca2+. No interaction was instead observed between EDF-1 and agarose (Fig. 1 A). We then evaluated whether EDF-1 and CaM interact also in vivo. To this purpose, HUVEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against CaM, and Western blot was performed utilizing an immunopurified antibody against EDF-1. In HUVEC, EDF-1 and CaM coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained when lysates were immunoprecipitated for EDF-1, and Western blot was performed using anti-CaM antibodies (data not shown). No bands were detectable after immunoprecipitation with nonimmune IgGs (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 2 shows that EDF-1 and CaM also colocalize both in the nucleus and in the cytosol. Interestingly, upon exposure to TPA (100 nm), EDF-1 was mainly localized in the nucleus (see below), whereas the subcellular localization of CaM was not significantly altered (Fig. 2). To evaluate whether different levels of intracellular Ca2+affected the interaction between CaM and EDF-1 in HUVEC, we exposed HUVEC for 20 min to the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 μm) to increase intracellular Ca2+ (21Ziemianin B. Olszanecki R. Uracz W. Marcinkiewicz E. Gryglewski R.J. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 597-604PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore coimmunoprecipitated EDF-1 and CaM. Fig. 1 C shows that in the presence of A23187 the interaction between EDF-1 and CaM was reduced. These results indicate that EDF-1 interacts with CaM, and this binding is regulated by the levels of Ca2+. Since EDF-1 contains conserved PKC phosphorylation sites, one of which is within the IQ domain, we examined whether the phosphorylation of EDF-1 by PKC affects its binding to CaM. EDF-1 was phosphorylated in vitro by PKC in the presence of Ca2+ and phospholipids (Fig.3 A). It is interesting to note that, once phosphorylated, EDF-1 did not interact with calmodulin-agarose, and the 32P-labeled protein was all recovered in the flow-through fraction of the column (Fig.3 B). We also determined whether Thr-91, which is the PKC phosphorylation site within the IQ motif, plays a role in modulating EDF-1 interaction with CaM. To this purpose, because the introduction of a negative charge mimics a phosphorylated residue, the Thr-91 → Asp mutation was introduced. Although the substitution of Thr-91 to Ala did not affect EDF-1-CaM interaction (data not shown), conversion of the Thr-91 to Asp (EDF-1T91D) markedly reduced the affinity of EDF-1 for CaM; indeed, no EDF-1T91>4 bound CaM (Fig.4). This results shows that introduction of a single negative charge by phosphorylation at Thr-91 inhibited CaM-EDF-1 interactions. We also mutated three additional putative PKC phosphorylation sites present throughout the sequence of EDF-1 with negatively charged amino acids, thus generating a mutant, denominated EDF-1D4, that mimics PKC phosphorylation of EDF-1. As described for the in vitro phosphorylated EDF-1, EDF-1D4 did not interact with CaM-agarose (Fig. 4). We evaluated whether EDF-1 is phosphorylated in vivo. To do so, HUVEC were metabolically labeled with 32P and exposed to the phorbol ester TPA (100 nm) for 15 min. Cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-EDF-1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were divided in two aliquots. One of them was utilized for autoradiography (Fig.5 A, upper panel), and the remaining one was used in Western analysis with anti-EDF-1 antibodies (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). Fig. 5 A shows that EDF-1, which is unphosphorylated in untreated HUVEC, was readily phosphorylated upon exposure to TPA. The degree of phosphorylation was increased when HUVEC were cotreated with TPA and A23187, probably due to the fact that when intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases, more EDF-1 is released from CaM and available to be phosphorylated. To evaluate whether in vivo phosphorylated EDF-1 bound or not to CaM, we coimmunoprecipitated EDF-1 and CaM in HUVEC exposed to TPA. As shown in Fig. 5 B, a lower amount of EDF-1 coimmunoprecipitated with CaM in TPA-treated cells when compared with controls. These results show that EDF-1 is a substrate of PKC, and PKC phosphorylation prevents its binding to CaM. It is noteworthy that, although EDF-1 was localized both in the nucleus and in the cytosol in control cells, EDF-1 was mainly associated with the nucleus of phorbol TPA-treated cells (Fig. 2). No relocalization of CaM was observed in TPA-treated cells. Since EDF-1 is highly homologous to MBF-1 which binds TBP, we investigated whether EDF-1 interacted with TBP. As shown in Fig. 6 A, EDF-1 and its mutants bound TBP to a similar extent in in vitro protein-protein interactions assays. This interaction was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-EDF-1 antibodies followed by Western blot utilizing an anti-TBP monoclonal antibody. Analogously, we found that in vitro phosphorylated EDF-1 interacted with TBP (data not shown). We also determined whether this interaction occurredin vivo in HUVEC treated or not with TPA (100 nm) for 20 min. We immunoprecipitated cell extracts with the anti-EDF-1 antibody, and Western analysis was performed using a monoclonal antibody against TBP. Fig. 6 B shows that EDF-1 and TBP coimmunoprecipitate. In addition, no modulation of this interaction occurred in HUVEC exposed to TPA. CaM is the principal Ca2+ receptor protein inside cells (15Cohen P. Klee C.B. Calmodulin. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The calcium-rich form of CaM activates a large array of enzymes that are part of intracellular signaling cascades controlling cellular homeostasis (16Marchisio P.C. Cirillo D. Naldini L. Primavera M.V. Teti A. Zambonin-Zallone A. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Because of the central role of CaM in signal transduction, there is interest in modulatory proteins that alter the way in which CaM senses calcium levels. CaM-binding proteins share a loosely defined IQ motif that directs binding to CaM in its calcium-free form (8Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In some cases, this binding is regulated by the PKC pathway (22Chakravarthy B. Morley P. Whitfield J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 12-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For instance, neuromodulin and neurogranin binding to CaM is reversed when they are phosphorylated by PKC (22Chakravarthy B. Morley P. Whitfield J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 12-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that EDF-1, recently described as a factor involved in the repression of human endothelial cell differentiation (5Dragoni I. Mariotti M. Consalez G.G. Soria M. Maier J.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31119-31124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), contains an IQ motif, interacts with CaM, and is phosphorylated by PKC. Phosphorylation of EDF-1 by PKC prevents the protein from binding CaM, thus suggesting that PKC phosphorylation and CaM binding are mutually exclusive. In addition, upon PKC activation in HUVEC, EDF-1 is translocated to the nucleus where it may exert its function as a transcriptional coactivator. Indeed, we demonstrate by in vitro protein-protein interaction that EDF-1 binds TBP. Moreover, TBP and EDF-1 coimmunoprecipitate in HUVEC, and this interaction is not affected in HUVEC exposed to TPA. We therefore suggest that TPA potentiates the accumulation of EDF-1 in the nucleus where a large amount of EDF-1 would be available to interact with TBP, thus regulating transcription. We therefore hypothesize that EDF-1 serves two principal roles. In the cytosol EDF-1 interacts with CaM in the presence of low Ca2+, and in the nucleus it interacts with TBP and modulates transcription. Accordingly, during the course of this work, Kabe et al. (23Kabe Y. Goto M. Shima D. Imai T. Wasa T. Morohashi K. Shirakawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34196-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that the human homologue of MBF-1, which is identical to EDF-1, interacts with TBP and Ad4BP/SF-1, a mammalian counterpart of FTZ-F1, by gel shift. The nuclear staining of EDF-1 is intriguing, since EDF-1 does not possess a nuclear localization sequence (24Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32–33: 76-83Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, EDF-1 is detected both in the cytosol and in the nucleus of control cells. Upon PKC activation, nuclear translocation of EDF-1 is enhanced. It is conceivable to think that EDF-1 is driven to the nucleus by a shuttle protein (25Truant R. Fridell R.A. Benson E.R. Herold A. Cullen B.R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 77: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and that PKC potentiates this shuttle mechanism. In partial disagreement with our results, Kabe et al. (23Kabe Y. Goto M. Shima D. Imai T. Wasa T. Morohashi K. Shirakawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34196-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) show that, when ectopically expressed in COS-1, EDF-1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, and coexpression with Ad4BP/SF1 induced nuclear localization of EDF-1. It should be recalled that we localize endogenously synthesized EDF-1 in human endothelial cells, whereas Kabeet al. (23Kabe Y. Goto M. Shima D. Imai T. Wasa T. Morohashi K. Shirakawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34196-34202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) perform their experiments in a totally different system, i.e. transiently transfected COS-1. However, we agree on the fact that the fate of EDF-1 is to be translocated to the nucleus where it may connect the DNA-binding domain of transcription factors and TBP. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration about the expression of a CaM-binding protein that may modulate CaM activation in endothelial cells. When activated CaM influences various metabolic pathways, among which is the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) through endothelial NO synthase (26Sase K Michel T. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 25-34Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NO not only is a potent vasodilator, thus regulating arterial pressure (27Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D. Moskowicz M.A. Bevan J.A. Fishman F.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), but it is also involved in the nonproliferative events of angiogenesis (28Fukumura D. Jain R.K. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998; 17: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate about a relation between EDF-1 and NO levels and its implication in vascular disease and in angiogenesis. We show that in vitro EDF-1 has a rather high affinity for CaM-agarose and elutes with 1 mm Ca2+. It is unlikely that 1 mm levels of free Ca2+ may be reached within the cell; however, it is conceivable that free Ca2+ accumulates in highly specialized areas. It is reported that the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 transiently increases Ca2+ by 4–5-fold in endothelial cells (21Ziemianin B. Olszanecki R. Uracz W. Marcinkiewicz E. Gryglewski R.J. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 597-604PubMed Google Scholar). We show that this increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels is sufficient to release, at least in part, EDF-1 from CaM. Under these experimental conditions, we hypothesize that calcium-CaM would activate a large array of enzymes, whereas EDF-1 would be available for phosphorylation and/or bind a shuttle protein to be transported to the nucleus where it would mediate transactivation by stabilizing the protein-DNA interaction. Interestingly, a range of Ca2+concentrations between 2 and 5 mm is required to release two prototypic neural-specific CaM-binding proteins, neuromodulin and neurogranin, from CaM-agarose (29Gerendasy D.D. Herron S.R. Jennings P.A. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6741-6750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been hypothesized that neurogranin and neuromodulin may function to concentrate CaM at specific sites in neurons and release free CaM in response to increased Ca2+ and PKC activation (22Chakravarthy B. Morley P. Whitfield J. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 12-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate about the significance of EDF-1-CaM interaction. More experiments are required to address this issue. In the case of an endothelial cell exposed to angiogenic factors, we hypothesize the following scenario. After binding to their cognate receptors, angiogenic factors lead to the release of Ca2+from internal stores and diacylglycerols, which stimulate PKC (30Friesel R. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 31Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These two collaborate to sustain high levels of calcium-CaM and calcium/CaM-dependent enzyme activity. Moreover, Ca2+ reduces the affinity of EDF-1 for CaM, and PKC blocks the re-binding of CaM by phosphorylating EDF-1. This leads to an increase in free EDF-1, part of which is phosphorylated by PKC and promptly translocated to the nucleus where EDF-1 would modulate gene expression. We thank Dr. L. Beguinot for critical reading of the manuscript."

We isolated a β-1,4-GalT-I single knockout human B cell clone producing monoclonal IgM and several transfectant clones that overexpressed β-1,4-GalT-I or GnT-III. In the β-1,4-GalT-I-single knockout cells, the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of IgM was increased, where β-1,4-GalT activity was reduced to about half that in the parental cells, and GnT-III activity was unaltered. In the β-1,4-GalT-I transfectants, the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition was reduced although GnT-III activity was not altered significantly. In the GnT-III transfectants, the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition increased along with the increase in levels of GnT-III activity. The extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of IgM was significantly correlated with the level of intracellular β-1,4-GalT activity relative to that of GnT-III. These results were interpreted as indicating that β-1,4-GalT competes with GnT-III for substrate in the cells.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This GlcNAc residue has been termed a “bisecting” GlcNAc and is formed by β-d-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III).1 GnT-III is presumed to be involved in pathological conditions, because an increase in its expression is accompanied by malignant transformation or oncofetal changes (4Miyoshi E.

Kanayama Y. Matuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the function of the bisecting GlcNAc is not well understood, this modification can inhibit the action of some enzymes (α-mannosidase-II, GnT-II, GnT-V, core α-1,6-fucosyltransferase) in the subsequent biosynthesis of N-linked sugar chains, suggesting a regulatory role in the formation of complex-type and hybrid-type sugar chains (6Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It is also known that the occurrence of bisecting GlcNAc-containing sugar chains on IgG increases with age (7Yamada E. Tsukamoto Y. Sasaki R. Yagyu K. Takahashi N. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Here, we studied a method to control the addition of bisecting GlcNAc to N-linked sugar chains. We used human monoclonal IgM as a model glycoprotein for control of the attachment of the bisecting GlcNAc residue. Human IgM is a glycoprotein containing 7–12% carbohydrate distributed at five N-glycosylation sites in the constant region of the heavy chain at positions Asn-171, Asn-332, Asn-395, Asn-402, and Asn-563 (8Shimizu A. Putnam F.W. Paul C. Clamp J.R. Johnson I. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Putnam F.W. Florent G. Paul C. Shinoda T. Shimizu A.

The sugar chains at Asn-402 and Asn-563 are high mannose-type chains, and those at Asn-171, Asn-332, and Asn-395 are complex-type chains. Sugar chains of the human IgM produced by hybridoma cells were analyzed at each of the five glycosylation sites on the μ-chain (13Monica T.J. Williams S.B. Goochee C.F. Maiorella B.L.

Although the function of the sugar chains of IgM is not well understood, it has been demonstrated that the sugar chain structure at Asn-402 on mouse IgM influences the ability of the IgM-antigen complex to bind complement (15Wright J.F. Shulman M.J. Isenman D.E. Painter R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bazin et al. (16Bazin R. Darveau A. Martel F. Pelletier A. Piche L. St-Laurent M. Thibault L. Demers A. Boyer L. Lemieux G. Lemieux R. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3889-3893PubMed Google Scholar) reported that murine hybridoma-produced IgM lacking the sugar chain at Asn-563 had increased avidity for antigen. The function of the sugar chains of antibodies has been well studied in the case of IgG. For example, hypogalactosylation of IgG has been shown to affect some of the effector functions of the IgG molecule including binding to complement C1q and mannose-binding protein (17Tsuchiya N. Endo T. Matsuta K. Yoshinoya S. Aikawa T. Kosuge E. Takeuchi F. Miyamoto T. Kobata A. J. Rheumatol. 1989; 16: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher frequency of IgG lacking galactose (18Parekh R.B. Roitt I.M. Isenberg D.A. Dwek R.A Ansell B.M. Rademacher T.W. Lancet. 1988; 1: 966-969Abstract PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Our original interest was to investigate the effect of hypogalactosylation on the function of IgM. For this purpose, we attempted to isolate β-1,4-GalT-I-null B cells producing IgM. Although we failed to isolate β-1,4-GalT-I-null cells, we isolated a single knockout cell clone in which the β-1,4-GalT level was reduced to half due to disruption of one of the two β-1,4-GalT-I alleles. In the case of the IgM produced by this β-1,4-GalT-I single knockout clone, hypogalactosylation was not observed; however, we discovered that the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of the IgM was increased. To explain this unexpected increase in the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition, we speculated that β-1,4-GalT might compete with GnT-III for substrate in the cells. It has been previously reported that, in an in vitro system using sugar chains in a free form or glycopeptides, GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT react with an agalactosyl nonbisected biantennary sugar chain as a common substrate, suggesting that GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT enzymatically compete for the substrate in vitro (19Fujii S.

However, the occurrence of such competition in intact cells was viewed as questionable considering the subcellular localization of the two enzymes, as reported previously (21Roth J. Berger E.G. J.

J. 1995; 12: 447Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the present study, we attempted to demonstrate experimentally the competition between β-1,4-GalT and GnT-III in intact cells. We demonstrate that the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of IgM is significantly correlated with the level of intracellular β-1,4-GalT activity relative to that of GnT-III. Our studies demonstrate that sugar chain structures can be systematically and quantitatively controlled by regulating the levels of expression of glycosyltransferases.DISCUSSIONWe originally attempted to obtain β-1,4-GalT-I-deficient B cells producing IgM to examine the effect of hypogalactosylation on the function of IgM. For this purpose, we isolated a single knockout clone in which the intracellular level of β-1,4-GalT activity was reduced to half due to disruption of one of the two β-1,4-GalT-I alleles. In the β-1,4-GalT-I single knockout cells, under-galactosylated sugar chains were not observed in the IgM produced. Instead, we discovered an interesting phenomenon, the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of IgM was increased in the cells, suggesting that β-1,4-GalT is somehow involved in the formation of the bisecting GlcNAc.It has been shown in vitro that GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT can react with an agalactosyl nonbisected biantennary sugar chain as a common substrate (19Fujii S. Nishiura T. Nishikawa A. Miura R. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6009-6018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gleeson P.A. Schachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6162-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When β-1,4-GalT first catalyzes the conversion of this sugar chain to a galactosylated form, the latter product can no longer be a substrate for GnT-III, indicating that GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT compete for an agalactosyl nonbisected biantennary sugar chain as a common substrate. Therefore, the increased extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition found in the case of β-1,4-GalT-I single knockout cells could be explained by the competition between GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT for substrate. Nishiura et al. (34Nishiura T. Fujii S. Kanayama Y. Nishikawa A. Tomiyama Y. Iida M. Karasuno T. Nakao H. Yonezawa T. Taniguchi N. Tarui S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5345-5350PubMed Google Scholar) also suggested that the extent of bisecting GlcNAc formation and that of galactose addition in IgG are controlled by the balance between GnT-III activity and β-1,4-GalT activity. For such competition to occur, however, GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT should be located at the same subcellular site. It is well known that glycosyltransferases are located on the specific lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus in the order of the oligosaccharide processing pathway. β-1,4-GalT is known to be localized on the trans Golgi stacks (21Roth J. Berger E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 223-229Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 22Goldberg D.E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3159-3165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas GnT-III is considered to be present on the medial Golgi stacks (23Nagai K. Ihara Y. Wada Y. Taniguchi N. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Ihara Y. Senda T. Nishikawa A. Miyoshi E. Yoshimura M. Zhang N.-Z. Taniguchi N. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 447Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). That is to say, the two enzymes were considered to be located at different sites. Therefore, it has been thought that β-1,4-GalT would not likely be able to compete with GnT-III in intact cells, even if the two enzymes compete in vitro when together they are allowed to react with an agalactosyl nonbisected biantennary sugar chain.In the present study, we examined whether β-1,4-GalT and GnT-III compete for a common substrate within the cells. As described above, the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of IgM was increased in the case of β-1,4-GalT-I single knockout clone Y6-17, whereas the extent was decreased in the case of the β-1,4-GalT-I transfectants. In the GnT-III transfectants, the extent increased along with the increase in levels of GnT-III activity. The extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of IgM was significantly correlated with the level of intracellular β-1,4-GalT activity relative to that of GnT-III. From these findings, the competition between the two enzymes in cells is apparent. Therefore, it was concluded that the addition of the bisecting GlcNAc residue was not only catalyzed by GnT-III but was also controlled by the level of expression of β-1,4-GalT relative to that of GnT-III. Thus, we have demonstrated that the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to sugar chains can be controlled by changing the levels of expression of the competing enzymes, β-1,4-GalT and GnT-III. The demonstrated competition between β-1,4-GalT and GnT-III means that these two enzymes co-exist at the same site in the cells. However, since we still do not know where the overexpressed β-1,4-GalT-I and GnT-III proteins are localized on the Golgi stacks in the transfectants, further study is needed to confirm completely the competition between these two enzymes in the cells.It is noted that a rough tendency of addition of sialic acid residues to be somewhat suppressed by the presence of bisecting GlcNAc residue was observed. This result might indicate that the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc residue inhibits sialyltransferase reaction as reported in vitro (35Nemansky M. Schiphorst W.E.C.M. Van den Eijnden D.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).A functional difference between IgM molecules with and without the bisecting GlcNAc has not been clearly demonstrated so far in our studies on the pharmacokinetics and binding to C1q (data not shown). The functional role of the bisecting GlcNAc residues added to the sugar chains of IgM should be elucidated through further investigation.It is well known that sugar chains play important roles in defining the characteristics of glycoproteins such as their biological activity, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, solubility, and protease resistance. The functions of glycoproteins are expected to be improved by remodeling of the sugar chain structures. Techniques for controlling the sugar chain structures are necessary for this purpose. Here we have succeeded in controlling sugar chain structures systematically for the first time by regulating the levels of expression of glycosyltransferases, even though the control was performed only in terms of the attachment of bisecting GlcNAc. The present work should serve as a cornerstone for further studies aimed to control sugar chain structures. A β-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine residue attached to the mannose-β-1,4- in the trimannosyl core of N-linked sugar chains has been described in complex-type and hybrid-type sugar chains of various glycoproteins such as IgA, IgG, IgM, etc. (1Baenziger J.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This GlcNAc residue has been termed a “bisecting” GlcNAc and is formed by β-d-mannoside β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT-III).1 GnT-III is presumed to be involved in pathological conditions, because an increase in its expression is accompanied by malignant transformation or oncofetal changes (4Miyoshi E.

Kanayama Y. Matuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 60: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the function of the bisecting GlcNAc is not well understood, this modification can inhibit the action of some enzymes (α-mannosidase-II, GnT-II, GnT-V, core α-1,6-fucosyltransferase) in the subsequent biosynthesis of N-linked sugar chains, suggesting a regulatory role in the formation of complex-type and hybrid-type sugar chains (6Schachter H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). It is also known that the occurrence of bisecting GlcNAc-containing sugar chains on IgG increases with age (7Yamada E. Tsukamoto Y. Sasaki R. Yagyu K. Takahashi N. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here, we studied a method to control the addition of bisecting GlcNAc to N-linked sugar chains. We used human monoclonal IgM as a model glycoprotein for control of the attachment of the bisecting GlcNAc residue. Human IgM is a glycoprotein containing 7–12% carbohydrate distributed at five N-glycosylation sites in the constant region of the heavy chain at positions Asn-171, Asn-332, Asn-395, Asn-402, and Asn-563 (8Shimizu A.

The sugar chains at Asn-402 and Asn-563 are high mannose-type chains, and those at Asn-171, Asn-332, and Asn-395 are complex-type chains. Sugar chains of the human IgM produced by hybridoma cells were analyzed at each of the five glycosylation sites on the μ-chain (13Monica T.J. Williams S.B. Goochee C.F. Maiorella B.L. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 14Leibiger H. Kersten B. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although the function of the sugar chains of IgM is not well understood, it has been demonstrated that the sugar chain structure at Asn-402 on mouse IgM influences the ability of the IgM-antigen complex to bind complement (15Wright J.F. Shulman M.J. Isenman D.E. Painter R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10506-10513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bazin et al. (16Bazin R. Darveau A. Martel F. Pelletier A. Piche L. St-Laurent M. Thibault L. Demers A. Boyer L. Lemieux G. Lemieux R. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3889-3893PubMed Google Scholar) reported that murine hybridoma-produced IgM lacking the sugar chain at Asn-563 had increased avidity for antigen. The function of the sugar chains of antibodies has been well studied in the case of IgG. For example, hypogalactosylation of IgG has been shown to affect some of the effector functions of the IgG molecule including binding to complement C1q and mannose-binding protein (17Tsuchiya N. Endo T. Matsuta K. Yoshinoya S. Aikawa T. Kosuge E. Takeuchi F. Miyamoto T. Kobata A. J. Rheumatol. 1989; 16: 285-290PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher frequency of IgG lacking galactose (18Parekh R.B. Roitt I.M. Isenberg D.A. Dwek R.A Ansell B.M. Rademacher T.W. Lancet. 1988; 1: 966-969Abstract PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our original interest was to investigate the effect of hypogalactosylation on the function of IgM. For this purpose, we attempted to isolate β-1,4-GalT-I-null B cells producing IgM. Although we failed to isolate β-1,4-GalT-I-null cells, we isolated a single knockout cell clone in which the β-1,4-GalT level was reduced to half due to disruption of one of the two β-1,4-GalT-I alleles. In the case of the IgM produced by this β-1,4-GalT-I single knockout clone, hypogalactosylation was not observed; however, we discovered that the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition to the sugar chains of the IgM was increased. To explain this unexpected increase in the extent of bisecting GlcNAc addition, we speculated that β-1,4-GalT might compete with GnT-III for substrate in the cells. It has been previously reported that, in an in vitro system using sugar chains in a free form or glycopeptides, GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT react with an agalactosyl nonbisected biantennary sugar chain as a common substrate, suggesting that GnT-III and β-1,4-GalT enzymatically compete for the substrate in vitro (19Fujii S.

M., Morelli, L., Augugliaro, R., Barbaresi, M., Ciccone, E., and Moretta, L. (1993) J. Exp. Med. 178, 597–604). The transduction of inhibitory signals by KIR2D molecules is impaired by the zinc chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, and mutation of a putative zinc-binding site (Rajagopalan, S., and Long, E. O. (1998)J. Immunol. 161, 1299–1305), but the mechanism by which zinc may affect the function of KIR remains unknown. In this study, the inhibitory NK receptor KIR2DL1 was discovered to dimerize in the presence of Co2+ as observed on native gel electrophoresis and by gel filtration column chromatography. Furthermore, Co2+-mediated KIR2DL1 dimer binds to HLA-Cw4 with higher affinity than the wild type KIR2DL1 monomer. Replacement of the amino-terminal His residue by Ala abolishes the ability of KIR2DL1 to bind Co2+, indicating that Co2+-mediated KIR2DL1 dimerization involves pairing of the D1 domain. Although not observed on native gels, the inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 can be chemically cross-linked into dimers in the presence of Zn2+and its related divalent metal ions, suggesting that Co2+-mediated dimerization of KIR2DL1 may mimic a weaker interaction between KIR2DL1 and zinc in vivo.

Wagtmann N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and2Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). In humans, the killer cell immunoglobulin-related receptors (KIR) consist of either two (KIR2D) or three (KIR3D) Ig-like domains and recognize polymorphic HLA-C and HLA-B molecules, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 1Long E.O. Wagtmann N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 2Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Inhibitory KIR molecules contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in their cytoplasmic tails, which are involved in negative signaling. The activating KIR molecules have similar extracellular domain structures as the inhibitory receptors, but lack the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in their cytoplasmic domains and contain a positively charged Lys residue in their transmembrane segments (reviewed in Refs.1Long E.O. Wagtmann N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar and 2Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). The inhibitory KIR2D molecules (KIR2D with a long cytoplasmic tail and referred to as KIR2DL or p58) specifically interact with HLA-C alleles (3Moretta A. Vitale M. Bottino C. Orengo A.M. Morelli L.

For example, KIR2DL1 recognizes HLA-Cw4 and related HLA-C molecules that contain Asn77 and Lys80; KIR2DL2 recognizes HLA-Cw3 and related molecules that have Ser77and Asn80 (3Moretta A. Vitale M.

A. 1993; 90: 12000-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). KIR2DL molecules contain a putative zinc-binding motif (HEXXH) sequence (6Jongeneel C.V. Bouvier J. Bairoch A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), HEGVH (residues 1–5), in their extracellular domains, suggesting that zinc plays a role in the structure and function of KIR2D. Because the extracellular domain of KIR2DL1 can be refolded in the presence of EDTA and the zinc chelator, 1,10-phenanthroline, and the refolded KIR2DL1 binds to HLA-Cw4, zinc is not required for the proper folding of KIR2D or the specific interaction between KIR2D and HLA-C (7Fan Q.R. Garboczi D.N. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, functional assays have established that KIR2D-mediated inhibition of target cell lysis can be reduced by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline and polyHis (8Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rajagopalan S. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4143-4146PubMed Google Scholar). The clustering of HLA-C induced by inhibitory KIR molecules at the NK cell/target cell synapse is also abrogated by 1,10-phenanthroline (10Davis D.M. Chiu I. Fassett M. Cohen G.B. Mandelboim O. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15062-15067Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the His residues in the amino-terminal zinc motif (HEGVH) impairs the ability of a KIR2D molecule to deliver inhibitory signals but not its ability to bind HLA-C (8Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that zinc mediates a protein-protein interaction that contributes to the signaling by KIR after ligand binding (8Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that the extracellular domain of the inhibitory NK receptor KIR2DL1 dimerizes in the presence of Co2+. Both soluble 2DL1H (amino acids H1-H224) and 2DL1T (amino acids H1-T200) can be dimerized by Co2+, indicating that dimerization of KIR2DL1 does not require the carboxyl-terminal stem region, residues 201–224. Co2+-mediated KIR2DL1 dimer also binds to HLA-Cw4 with higher affinity or avidity than KIR2DL1 monomer. Mutation of the amino-terminal His residue alone abolishes the ability of KIR2DL1 to form dimers through Co2+. The activating receptor KIR2DS4 does not have the amino-terminal His, and does not bind to Co2+. The formation of KIR2DL1 dimers can also be observed in the presence of Zn2+ and its related divalent metal ions (Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+) when the dimers are stabilized by chemical cross-linking. Other divalent metal ions (Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe2+) do not cause dimerization of KIR2DL1. Zn2+, like Co2+, might have the ability to cause aggregation of KIR2D/HLA-C complexes. The expression plasmids for 2DL1H (amino acids 1–224; previously named sol-cl42H), 2DL1T (amino acids 1–200; previously named sol-cl42T), HLA-Cw4 heavy chain, and β2m were constructed as described (7Fan Q.R.

The protein coding region for the extracellular domain of KIR2DS4 (amino acids Gln1-His224, named 2DS4H) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pSPORT I p58-cl39 (11Wagtmann N.

The polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and ligated into the pLM-1 vector. The plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS for expression. The mutant constructs H1A, H5A, H1AH5A, H13A, H182A, and E2A were created by site-directed mutagenesis, using the expression plasmid of 2DL1T as the template and the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For the H1A mutant, the His residue at position 1 was replaced by Ala using the 5′-primer AAGGAGGATATTAAAATGGCTGAAGGAGTACACCGT and a 3′-primer that contains the complementary sequence. The H5A mutant involves changing His5 to Ala, and was constructed with the 5′-primer ATGCACGAAGGAGTAGCTCGTAAACCTTCTCTCCTG and its complement. The double mutant H1AH5A was engineered by mutating both His1and His5 residues into alanines with the 5′-primer AAGGAGGATATTAAAATGGCTGAAGGAGTAGCTCGTAAACCTTCTCTCCTG and its complement. The H13A mutant was generated by replacing His13 with Ala, using the 5′-primer CCTTCTCTCCTGGCCGCTCCAGGTCCCCTGGTG and its complement. The H182A mutant was constructed by mutating His182 to Ala with the 5′-primer TGCTTCGGCTCTTTCGCTGACTCTCCATACGAG and its complement. The E2A mutant contains the mutation from Glu residue at position 2 to Ala, and was created using the 5′-primer GATATTAAAATGCACGCTGGAGTACACCGTAAACCT and a 3′-primer that encodes the complementary sequence. The plasmids for all of the mutant constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS for expression. The inclusion bodies for the 2DS4H and all of mutant 2DL1T constructs were prepared using the same protocol as for 2DL1H and 2DL1T (7Fan Q.R. Garboczi D.N. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O.

Refolding of 2DS4H and the mutants were carried out following the same procedure as described for 2DL1H and 2DL1T, and involved injections of 2.5–3.0 mg/ml inclusion body solutions to a refolding buffer containing 100 mmTris, pH 8.3/0.5 ml-arginine/2 mmEDTA/6.4 mm cysteamine/3.6 mm cystamine/0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (7Fan Q.R.

Similar to 2DL1H and 2DL1T, refolded 2DS4H and the 2DL1T mutants were concentrated by a weak anion-exchange (diethylaminoethyl cellulose, DE-52) column and then purified by Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0/150 mm NaCl. The class I major histocompatibility complex molecule HLA-Cw4 was refolded in the presence of β2m and the peptide QYDDAVYKL (7Fan Q.R. Garboczi D.N. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Proc.

Binding assays between soluble KIR2DL1 molecules (2DL1H and 2DL1T) and divalent metal ions were carried out at 4 °C for 30 min in a reaction buffer containing 50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.5. The divalent metal ion solutions include Co2+(CoCl2·6H2O), Zn2+(ZnCl2), Ni2+(NiCl2·6H2O), Mn2+(MnCl2 ·4H2O), Mg2+(MgCl2·6H2O), Ca2+(CaCl2·2H2O), Cd2+(3CdSO4·8H2O), Cu2+(CuSO4·5H2O), and Fe2+(Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O). The reaction mixtures were analyzed on 15% native acrylamide gels using either the Tris/glycine or morpholine/bicine buffer system. The Tris/glycine gel mix consisted of 15% acrylamide in 300 mmTris, pH 8.5, and the gel running buffer contained 24.8 mmTris/192 mm glycine. Morpholine/bicine native gels contained 15% acrylamide in 60 mm morpholine/27 mm bicine, pH 9.0. Morpholine/bicine gel electrophoresis was also carried out in 60 mm morpholine/27 mmbicine, pH 9.0. Soluble 2DL1H or 2DL1T (0.4 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) was cross-linked with BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; Pierce) at room temperature for 15 min and then quenched with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8. The BS3 concentration used was 1.5 mm. Chemical cross-linking was carried out in the absence or presence of various divalent metal ions (Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, and Fe2+) at 0.2 mm concentration. The human inhibitory NK receptor KIR2DL1 dimerizes in the presence of Co2+ as demonstrated by the appearance of a KIR2DL1 dimer peak upon gel filtration chromatography for both the soluble constructs 2DL1H and 2DL1T. Soluble 2DL1H (previously named sol-cl42H) contains the entire extracellular domain of KIR2DL1, whereas 2DL1T (previously named sol-cl42T) lacks the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids (7Fan Q.R. Garboczi D.N. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 a, soluble 2DL1T formed a mixture of dimers (47 kDa) and monomers (21 kDa) after incubation with 0.05 mm Co2+ (expected molecular mass of the monomer is 22.2 kDa). Similarly, 2DL1H was eluted from a gel filtration column as a mixture of dimers (57 kDa) and monomers (26 kDa) in the presence of Co2+ (expected molecular mass of the monomer is 24.7 kDa) (data not shown). The fact that both 2DL1H and 2DL1T formed dimers in the presence of Co2+ indicates that the carboxyl-terminal stem region is not required for dimerization. Both 2DL1H and 2DL1T exist as monomers in solution in the absence of Co2+ (7Fan Q.R. Garboczi D.N. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7178-7183Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Co2+-initiated dimerization of KIR2DL1 can be detected by native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 b, in the presence of 0.1–10 mm Co2+, 2DL1H was shifted into an upper band similar in position to a disulfide-linked 2DL1H dimer, which we had constructed previously (13Fan, Q. R., Long, E. O., and Wiley, D. C. (2000)Eur. J. Immunol., in pressGoogle Scholar). A dimer band with an apparent molecular mass of around 44 kDa (expected molecular mass is 49 kDa) was also observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under nonreducing conditions when soluble 2DL1H was incubated with Co2+ (Fig. 1 c). Similar to 2DL1H, 2DL1T also formed dimers on native gels in the presence of Co2+ (shown later as a control in Fig. 5 a). Neither 2DL1H nor 2DL1T can be completely shifted into the dimer band even in the presence of excess amount of Co2+ (shown in Fig. 1 b for 2DL1H), probably because an equilibrium exists between the Co2+-bound dimers and Co2+-unbound monomers. The Co2+-bound KIR2DL1 dimers are stable in the presence of EDTA. Once formed, the Co2+-bound 2DL1H or 2DL1T dimers could not be dissociated by the addition of 10-fold excess EDTA (shown in Fig. 1 b for 2DL1H). Neither soluble 2DL1H nor 2DL1T formed stable dimers in the presence of Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, or Fe2+. Both the Co2+-bound 2DL1H and 2DL1T dimers bind to HLA-Cw4 with higher affinity or avidity than their corresponding monomers as demonstrated by native gel shift assays. As shown in Fig.2, a and b(lanes marked Co2+ (1Long E.O. Wagtmann N. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), a mixture of the KIR2DL1 monomer and Co2+-bound dimer was incubated with HLA-Cw4 to allow complex formation, and the complex band formed by the Co2+-bound KIR2DL1 dimer and HLA-Cw4 (band a) differed in its mobility on native gels from the complex between the KIR2DL1 monomer and HLA-Cw4 (band c). When excess monomer and Co2+-bound dimer were incubated with HLA-Cw4 at the same time, only the dimer/HLA-Cw4 complex was formed while the monomer remained unshifted (Fig. 2, aand b, lanes marked Co2+ (2Lanier L.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar)). The fact that the formation of Co2+-bound KIR2DL1 dimer/HLA-Cw4 complex always dominates over the formation of KIR2DL1 monomer/HLA-Cw4 complex suggests that Co2+-bound KIR2DL1 dimers have higher affinity or avidity for HLA-Cw4 than their corresponding monomers. The metal binding properties of KIR2DL1 have also been assayed on morpholine/bicine native gels. The morpholine/bicine buffer system was chosen to avoid the metal-chelating activities of Tris and glycine buffers (14Dawson, R. M. C., Elliott, D. C., Elliott, W. H., and Jones, K. M. (eds) (1986) Data for Biochemical Research, 3rd Ed., pp. 408–413, Oxford University Press, New YorkGoogle Scholar) that are normally used for native gels. Native gel electrophoresis using morpholine/bicine buffers has confirmed the Co2+-mediated dimerization of KIR2DL1 (shown in Fig.3 a for 2DL1H). Furthermore, it reveals that KIR2DL1 also binds to Cu2+. As shown in Fig.3 a, soluble 2DL1H migrates more slowly on native gels in the presence of Cu2+. This is consistent with the fact that binding of 2DL1H to a cation would reduce the overall negative charge of the protein, thereby reducing its mobility on native gels. The band corresponding to Cu2+-bound 2DL1H has a much faster mobility on native gels than Co2+-bound 2DL1H, possibly because 2DL1H does not form dimers in the presence of Cu2+. Similar band shifts have been observed for 2DL1T in the presence of Cu2+ (shown later as a control in Fig. 5 b). Neither 2DL1H nor 2DL1T was gel-shifted in the presence of Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, or Fe2+ (shown in Fig.3 a for 2DL1H). KIR2DL1 remained monomeric after Cu2+ binding as judged by gel filtration chromatography. Fig. 3 b shows the gel filtration chromatography profile of 2DL1H that had been incubated with 0.05 mm Cu2+. Only a monomeric peak of 2DL1H corresponding to 24 kDa was observed. Similarly, 2DL1T incubated with Cu2+ exhibited a retention time corresponding to a 22-kDa protein on a gel filtration column (data not shown). No dimer peak was observed for either 2DL1H or 2DL1T that would suggest a monomer/dimer equilibrium in the presence of Cu2+. The Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on KIR2DL1 overlap, because the binding of KIR2DL1 to one of the metal ions prevents its interaction with the other. Fig.4 shows a morpholine/bicine native gel that compares the Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on 2DL1H. When 2DL1H was first incubated with Co2+, and then with Cu2+ (Co2+ + Cu2+ lane), the amount of the Co2+-bound 2DL1H dimer formed was the same as when 2DL1H was incubated with Co2+ alone (Co2+ lane). The faint lower band in the Co2+ + Cu2+ lanecorresponds to Cu2+-bound 2DL1H and results from the binding of Co2+-unbound 2DL1H monomer to Cu2+. In the reverse situation, when 2DL1H was incubated with Cu2+, followed by Co2+, only a band shift corresponding to Cu2+ binding was observed (Cu2+ + Co2+ lane). Similarly, binding of 2DL1T to Co2+ inhibited its binding to Cu2+ and vice versa (data not shown). The Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on KIR2DL1 may be identical or at least share some common residues. To compare the metal binding properties of KIR2DL1 with the activating NK receptor KIR2DS4, we expressed the extracellular domain of KIR2DS4 (amino acids 1–224; 2DS4H) in E. coli and refolded it from inclusion bodies. The soluble activating receptor 2DS4H exists as a monomer in solution, because it was eluted as a 30-kDa protein upon gel filtration chromatography (expected molecular mass of a 2DS4H monomer is 24.7 kDa) (data not shown). 2DS4H did not form dimers in the presence of Co2+ or any of the divalent metal ions tested (Zn2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, or Fe2+), as demonstrated on both Tris/glycine and morpholine/bicine native gels (data not shown). Soluble 2DS4H did not bind to Cu2+ either (data not shown). We exploited the fact that the inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 and the activating receptor KIR2DS4, which have very similar sequences, differ in their ability to bind Co2+ and Cu2+ to probe the location of the Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on KIR2DL1 by mutagenesis. A survey of several known structures indicated that His and Cys are the most common ligands for Zn2+ (15Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). Because Co2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ have similar chemical properties, we suspect that His and Cys residues may be used for the coordination of Co2+and Cu2+ in KIR2DL1. KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS4 contain Cys residues at identical positions. A sequence comparison of the extracellular domains of KIR2DL1 and KIR2DS4 indicates that the His residues that are present in KIR2DL1 but missing in KIR2DS4 include His1 at the amino terminus, His13 in the first β-strand of the D1 domain, and His182 at the domain elbow (16Fan Q.R. Mosyak L. Winter C.C. Wagtmann N. Long E.O. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Another His residue that may play a role in Co2+binding is His at position 5 of the amino-terminal zinc-binding motif (HEGVH, residues 1–5). Because mutation of His1 and His5 in the amino-terminal zinc-binding motif reduced the ability of KIR2DL1 to deliver inhibitory signals (8Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar), His5together with His1 in the amino-terminal region may participate in the coordination of Co2+ or Cu2+. We have engineered five different histidine mutants of KIR2DL1, replacing one or more of the His residues (positions 1, 5, 13, and 182) with Ala for the 2DL1T construct: H1A, H5A, H1AH5A, H13A, and H182A (see “Experimental Procedures”). All of the mutants were refolded to their soluble forms using the same procedure as for wild type 2DL1T. All the mutants bind to HLA-Cw4 as demonstrated by native gel shift assays (data not shown). A mutated KIR2DL1-Ig fusion protein having six His residues (positions 1, 5, 36, 40, 55, and 56) replaced by Ala was shown previously to bind to HLA-Cw4 (8Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar). The Co2+ and Cu2+ binding properties of the mutants were assayed on Tris/glycine and morpholine/bicine native gels, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5 a, mutation of the amino-terminal His1 alone (H1A) abolished the Co2+-binding activity of 2DL1T. Mutating His5(H5A), His13 (H13A), or His182 (H182A) to Ala did not affect the dimerization of 2DL1T by Co2+. The double mutant H1AH5A no longer bound to Co2+, because it contained the mutation from His1 to Ala. As expected from the fact that the Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on KIR2DL1 overlap, the H1A and H1AH5A mutants did not bind to Cu2+ either (Fig. 5 b). We have therefore identified the amino-terminal His residue as part of the Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on KIR2DL1. To test whether the Glu residue at position 2 in the putative zinc-binding motif (HEGVH, residues 1–5) may play a role in Co2+ binding, we also made a mutant changing Glu2 to Ala (E2A). Like the wild type 2DL1T, the E2A mutant dimerizes in the presence of Co2+ (data not shown), indicating that Glu2 is not involved in the binding of 2DL1T to Co2+. A sequence alignment of the extracellular domains of different KIRs indicates that the amino-terminal His residue is conserved in all inhibitory KIR molecules containing two Ig-like domains (KIR2DL). All the inhibitory KIR2DL receptors may therefore have the potential to form dimers in the presence of Co2+. Although the activating receptor KIR2DS4 does not have an amino-terminal His, and does not bind Co2+, several other activating KIR2D molecules (KIR2DS, also known as p50) (17Moretta A. Sivori S.

An amino-terminal His is also found in some inhibitory and activating KIR molecules with three Ig-like domains, D0, D1, and D2, (KIR3D) (4Wagtmann N. Rajagopalan S. Winter C.C. Peruzzi M. Long E.O.

Immunogenetics. 1996; 44: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), such as KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1. However, KIR3DL2 does not have the amino-terminal His. Whether the initial His residue can cause dimerization of KIR3D molecules and pairing of the D0 domain still remains to be explored. There is no His in the KIR3D molecules at the amino terminus of the D1 domain, the homologous position of the KIR2D amino-terminal His. Although we have not observed any binding between KIR2DL1 and Zn2+ by native gel shift assays, we cannot rule out the possibility that KIR2DL1 binds Zn2+ with a lower affinity. Except for the coenzyme vitamin B12 (23Lenhert P.G. Hodgkin D.C. Nature. 1961; 192: 937-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), there are very few biological systems that utilize cobalt. Co2+ can often substitute for Fe2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ in vitro; examples include the replacement of natural iron heme in hemoglobin and myoglobin with a synthetic Co2+ heme (24Collman J.P. Halpert T.R. Suslick K.S. Spiro T.G. Metal Ion Activation of Dioxygen. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980: 1-72Google Scholar), Co2+ derivatives of blue copper proteins (25Gray H.B. Solomon E.I. Spiro T.G. Copper Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 1-40Google Scholar), and Co2+-substituted zinc-binding carboxypeptidase (26Vallee B.L. Galdes A. Auld D.S. Riordan J.F. Spiro T.G. Zinc Enzymes. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1983: 25-75Google Scholar). Although the amount of cobalt is hardly detectable in serum, zinc is present at 5–20 μm in serum in adults (27Lentner, C. (ed) (1981) Geigy Scientific Tables, 8th Ed., Vol. 3, Ciba-Geigy, Ardsley, NYGoogle Scholar). It is possible that the Co2+-mediated dimerization of KIR2DL1 mimics the interactions between KIR2DL1 and Zn2+ in vivo. To detect potential dimer formation of KIR2DL1 in the presence of Zn2+ and its related metal ions, soluble KIR2DL1 was incubated with various divalent metal ions and then chemically cross-linked with the reagent BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate) to stabilize any dimer formation, if it exists. The physiological concentration of free Zn2+ ion has been estimated to be approximately 0.25–1 μm (28Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), based on the fact that 95% of zinc in serum is complexed with proteins (29Thorlacius-Ussing O. Neuroendocrinology. 1987; 45: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,30Koppelman M.C. Greenwood V. Sohn J. Deuster P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1989; 68: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A much higher concentration of Zn2+ (0.2 mm) was needed for measurements here to allow visualization of the effect of Zn2+ on the oligomeric state of KIR2DL1, although some cross-linking was evident at 10 μmZn2+. In the absence of any metal ions, a very faint dimer band of soluble 2DL1H was observed when it was incubated with the cross-linker (Fig. 6). In contrast, a significant amount of 2DL1H formed dimers when cross-linked in the presence of Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ (Fig. 6). In addition to the dimer band, soluble 2DL1H also formed higher molecular weight aggregates in the presence of these metal ions (Fig. 6). The divalent metal ions Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ have similar chemical properties as Zn2+and can all substitute for Zn2+. In the presence of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe2+, only the background dimer band was observed (Fig. 6), suggesting that dimerization of KIR2DL1 is specifically mediated by Zn2+ and its related metal ions Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+. Like 2DL1H, soluble 2DL1T, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids, can also be specifically cross-linked into dimers by Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ (data not shown), confirming our earlier observation that the carboxyl-terminal stem region is not required for Co2+-mediated KIR2DL1 dimerization. In addition to the formation of a significant amount of dimers, higher molecular weight aggregates of KIR2DL1 have also been observed in the presence of Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ (Fig. 6). To explore the mode of divalent metal ion-induced aggregation, we have examined the effect of Co2+ on a KIR2DL1 dimer that is covalently linked at the carboxyl-terminal stem region by a disulfide bond (P220C) (13Fan, Q. R., Long, E. O., and Wiley, D. C. (2000)Eur. J. Immunol., in pressGoogle Scholar). The disulfide-linked dimer formed a dimer of dimers and even higher order dimer associates in the presence of Co2+ (Fig.7 a). Because the P220C dimer is linked at the carboxyl-terminal stem region after the D2 domain, the amino termini in the D1 domains of two neighboring P220C dimer molecules are free to dimerize through Co2+, thus resulting in the formation of a dimer of dimers and even higher order aggregates (Fig. 7 b). This hypothetical model for the aggregation of P220C dimer by Co2+ may represent the mechanism by which Zn2+ aggregates KIR·HLA-C complexes for signaling. The extracellular domain of the inhibitory NK receptor KIR2DL1 dimerizes in the presence of Co2+ as demonstrated by native and SDS-gel electrophoresis as well as gel filtration chromatography. Furthermore, the Co2+-bound dimer binds to HLA-Cw4 with higher affinity or avidity than does the KIR2DL1 monomer. Both the soluble 2DL1H (amino acids 1–224) and 2DL1T (amino acids 1–200) constructs form dimers through Co2+, indicating that the carboxyl-terminal stem region is not required for dimerization. Further mutational studies have revealed that the Co2+-binding site is located at the amino terminus of KIR2DL1; replacement of the initial His1 residue with Ala prevents the Co2+-induced dimerization of KIR2DL1. Because the amino-terminal His1residue is conserved in all inhibitory KIR2D molecules, Co2+-mediated dimerization may therefore be a common property of inhibitory NK receptors that specifically recognize HLA-C. The inhibitory receptor KIR2DL1 also binds to Cu2+, as shown by morpholine/bicine native gel electrophoresis; it remains monomeric upon Cu2+ binding as judged by gel filtration chromatography. However, the fact that Cu2+ can enhance chemical cross-linking of KIR2DL1 into dimers suggests that Cu2+ may dimerize KIR2DL1 in the same way as Co2+ but with lower affinity. Indeed, we have found that the Co2+- and Cu2+-binding sites on KIR2DL1 overlap, and the same mutation of His1 with Ala knocked out both the Co2+- and Cu2+-binding activities of KIR2DL1. Chemical cross-linking has also allowed us to detect dimerization of KIR2DL1 in the presence of Zn2+ and several of its related divalent metal ions (Ni2+ and Cd2+, in addition to Co2+ and Cu2+). Increased dimerization was not observed in the presence of other divalent metal ions (Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Fe2+), suggesting that dimerization of KIR2DL1 is specific for Zn2+ and its related metal ions. Binding of KIR2DL1 to Zn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ have not been observed on native gels or by gel filtration chromatography, indicating that KIR2DL1 has a much lower affinity for Zn2+ than for Co2+ and that Co2+-mediated dimerization may mirror the interaction between KIR2DL1 and Zn2+ in vivo. The weak interaction of Zn2+, relative to Co2+, with inhibitory NK receptors may be necessary to modulate the negative signaling in NK cells, because a strong interaction may result in the constitutive formation of dimers that are active in signaling. In summary, we have discovered that the inhibitory NK receptor KIR2DL1 dimerizes in the presence of Co2+ and found evidence that Co2+-mediated dimerization of KIR2DL1 may mimic the interaction between KIR2DL1 and Zn2+ in vivo. Because mutation of the amino-terminal His residues impairs the inhibitory function of KIR2D molecules (8Rajagopalan S. Long E.O. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1299-1305PubMed Google Scholar) and disrupts the Co2+-mediated dimerization of KIR2DL1 (this study), divalent metal ion (possibly Zn2+)-induced dimerization of KIR2D may be necessary for the delivery of an inhibitory signal. In the Co2+-bound KIR2DL1 dimer, the cytoplasmic tails may be far apart, because Co2+ binds to the amino terminus. Dimerization of the cytoplasmic domains could probably be achieved through a conformation resembling the disulfide-linked P220C dimer. Zn2+ may be required for the aggregation of KIR2D·HLA-C complexes in the same way that Co2+ causes aggregation of P220C dimers. We thank Dr. J. L. Strominger, Dr. H. Ploegh, and Dr. M.

While purifying CTCF, we observed that binding to the APBβ sequence became increasingly unstable as the level of purity increased. However, this instability could be overcome by supplementing the incubation mixture with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS and large amounts of nonspecific protein (5Vostrov A.V. Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33353-33359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Routinely, fetal calf serum (FCS) was used as a source of such protein. While optimizing the conditions for the binding reaction, we noticed that if crude nuclear extract was preincubated with an excess of FCS prior to the binding reaction, substantial changes in the electrophoretic mobility shift pattern occurred, resulting in binding complexes with higher electrophoretic mobilities. We have here isolated the factor responsible for this altered mobility shift and identified it as a protease activity associated with the plasma hyaluronan-binding protein PHBP (12Choi-Miura N.-H. Tobe T. Sumiya J.-I. Nakano Y. Sano Y. Mazda T. Tomita M. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The cDNA for this protein was previously cloned, and sequence analysis indicated the presence of a serine protease consensus domain. However, in the original preparations, proteolytic activity of PHBP was not demonstrated (12Choi-Miura N.-H. Tobe T. Sumiya J.-I. Nakano Y. Sano Y. Mazda T. Tomita M. J.

Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10 ng of labeled oligonucleotide (50,000–500,000 cpm) were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with 10–20 μg of protein from nuclear extract in buffer D supplemented with 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 5 μg of yeast tRNA, 2.5% CHAPS, and 1 ml of FCS in a total reaction volume of 30 μl. The incubation mixture was electrophoresed in 1% agarose or 6% polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 180 V constant voltage for 45 min. Gels were dried and autoradiographed for 2–4 h at −80 °C. Proteolytic activity was monitored by incubating 2 μl of nuclear extract aliquots prior to the binding reaction either with whole serum or with purified serum protein fractions in 5–10 μl of buffer D at 25 °C for 1 h. When needed, concentrated purified material was prediluted 10–100-fold with buffer D. Human serum (male) derived from whole clotted blood was purchased from Sigma. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to 500 ml of serum to 25% saturation. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was collected, and proteins were further precipitated by increasing the ammonium sulfate concentration to 50% saturation. The centrifugation was repeated, and the resulting pellet containing the bulk of the proteolytic activity was resuspended in 100 ml of buffer T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 200 mmKCl). The solution was dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of buffer T with one change of buffer. The dialyzed material was loaded on a 10-ml DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column preequilibrated with buffer T. The column was subsequently washed with three 20-ml portions of buffer T containing 300, 350, and 400 mm KCl. The bulk of the proteolytic activity was eluted with 30 ml of buffer T containing 700 mm KCl. Proteins were precipitated in ammonium sulfate at 60% saturation. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer D and dialyzed against 500 ml of the same buffer. The material was then loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-agarose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer D, and the proteins were eluted with 18 ml of a linear KCl gradient (100–700 mm). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the proteolytic activity was monitored as described above. One milliliter of HeLa cell nuclear extract was incubated with 3 μl of heparin-agarose-purified protease for 1 h at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μg of a peptide containing the KPI domain of APP (15Wagner S.L. Siegel R.S. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The KCl concentration in the reaction mixture was adjusted to 200 mm, and the reaction products were loaded on a 1-ml HiTrap SP Sepharose column preequilibrated with buffer D containing 200 mm KCl. The column was washed with 5 ml of buffer D containing 200 mm KCl and 4 ml of the same buffer containing 300 mm KCl. Proteins were eluted with 20 ml of a 300–700 mm linear KCl concentration gradient. Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by mobility shift electrophoresis. An Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 6HR 10/30 gel filtration column was equilibrated with buffer D containing 500 mm KCl, 2.5% CHAPS and calibrated with a set of globular proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HMW Calibration kit). SP Sepharose chromatography fractions 19–23 containing mobility shift activity were combined, supplemented with 2.5% CHAPS, concentrated on a Centricon-10 device (Amicon), and loaded on the gel filtration column. The gel filtration was performed at a 0.4 ml/min flow rate. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed by either mobility shift electrophoresis or Western blotting. Antibodies against the N- and C-terminal CTCF sequences were described elsewhere (5Vostrov A.V. Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33353-33359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They were affinity purified with a Pierce Sulfo-link kit and used as primary antibodies in the Western blotting ECL procedure (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was carried out according to manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE of proteins was performed with the Laemmli Tris-glycine system (14Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For some applications, 4–20% precast gradient Ready Gels (Bio-Rad) were used. When indicated, reducing agent (β-mercaptoethanol) was omitted in the sample buffer. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and photographed. Proteins were extracted from gels and renatured as described (16Wang J. Nishiyama K. Araki K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10105-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with some modifications. After electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, the gel was stained with cold 0.25M KCl, and the protein bands were excised. The gel slices were weighed, rinsed with nonreducing sample buffer, minced, and incubated with an equal volume of nonreducing sample buffer at 75 °C for 20 min. Extracted protein samples were collected with an Amicon Micropure .22 spin device. The gel extraction was repeated, and the samples were combined. Aliquots of the extracted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For renaturing purposes, the remaining extracted samples were supplemented with 9 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.15m NaCl, and 0.1% SDS. To each sample was added as a carrier 5 μl of DEAE chromatography (see above) flow-through fraction. This fraction exhibited no protelytic activity and was thus preferred over bovine serum albumin, which could carry traces of endogenous serum-derived proteolytic activity. The proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes of acetone at −20 °C overnight. Protein precipitates were centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 10 min, air dried, resuspended in 20 μl of 6 mguanidine hydrochloride, and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride in the samples was reduced to ∼5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.2 m by the addition of aliquots of buffer D at 10-min intervals. Residual guanidine hydrochloride was removed from the samples by desalting on Amersham Pharmacia Biotech G-25 spin columns preequilibrated with buffer D. Proteolytic activity was analyzed in the renatured samples as described above. For protein sequencing, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with amido black. Bands corresponding to 44- and 30-kDa proteins were excised. N-terminal sequencing was performed by Harvard Microchem (Cambridge, MA) Ten microliters of heparin-agarose-purified protease was incubated with 10 μCi of [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate ([3H]DFP) [NEN] at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE both under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, impregnated with [3H]Enchance (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for 72 h. The protease was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography in the presence of 6 m urea. Specifically, heparin-agarose-purified protease was diluted with 4 volumes of buffer D containing 6 m urea and was concentrated with a Centriplus-10 device (Amicon) to the original volume. The resulting material was diluted with an additional three volumes of buffer D containing 6 m urea, and the concentration procedure was repeated. The final concentrate was loaded on an UnoS 0.12-ml polishing column (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with buffer D containing 6 m urea. Proteins were eluted with 5 ml of a 100–600 mm linear KCl gradient in buffer D containing 6 m urea. 200-μl fractions were collected, aliquoted, and immediately frozen at −80 °C. 0.05 μl of heparin-agarose-purified protease was incubated in 4 μl of buffer D with the indicated amounts of the protease inhibitors (Fig. 7) for 10 min at 25 °C. Subsequently, the protease assay was performed as described above. A recombinant KPI domain peptide comprising amino acids 285–345 of the APP-751 protein (15Wagner S.L. Siegel R.S. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Van Nostrand W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1138-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and a mutated version of the recombinant peptide with a single substitution of arginine with isoleucine at position 301 were kindly provided by W. Van Nostrand. When nuclear extract from HeLa cells was incubated with an 80-mer oligonucleotide containing the APBβ domain of the APP promoter, a characteristic mobility shift complex b was formed (Fig. 1, lane 2). This complex is the result of transcription factor CTCF binding to the APBβ recognition sequence (5Vostrov A.V. Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33353-33359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, upon incubating the nuclear extract for 1 h at 25 °C with FCS before assembling the binding reaction, a substantial change in the electrophoretic mobility shift pattern occurred (Fig. 1, lanes 3–6). With increasing amounts of FCS in the preincubation reaction, the original mobility shift complex b was gradually eliminated as two new complexes, b1 and b2,with higher electrophoretic mobilities emerged. Moreover, at the highest concentration of FCS, complex b1 was also eliminated and only b2, the complex with the highest mobility, remained. A similar change in the mobility shift pattern was observed with adult bovine, horse, or rabbit serum (not shown), as well as with an ∼5–10-fold lower concentration of human serum (Fig. 1,lanes 7–10). They also occurred when crude nuclear extract was replaced with purified CTCF. However, significantly lower amounts of serum were required to achieve comparable results (not shown). The most plausible explanation for this alteration in mobility shift behavior is a proteolytic cleavage of the CTCF protein by a serum enzyme. To isolate the putative proteolytic activity, human serum was initially fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the proteolytic activity was recovered in fractions that precipitated between 30 and 50% saturation. The precipitated material was solubilized and loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column. The active fraction, which eluted at a 700 mm KCl concentration, was again precipitated with ammonium sulfate, solubilized, and further purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-agarose. The proteolytic activity eluted over a broad range of KCl concentration from 250 to 500 mm (Fig.2 B), which coincided with the concentration profile of eluted protein as measured by A 280 (Fig. 2 A). In addition to numerous other proteins distributed over a wide molecular mass range, the elution fractions contained a major protein with an approximate molecular mass of 70 kDa (Fig. 2 C). Fractions 12–18 that contained the highest level of activity (Fig. 2) were combined and used for further experiments. Because the excess of serum distorts the bands on polyacrylamide gels during mobility shift electrophoresis, we were restricted to agarose gels in our initial experiments (Figs. 1 and 2). Employing heparin-agarose-purified material instead of whole serum for nuclear extract preincubation allowed us to switch to polyacrylamide gels in mobility shift assays. This enabled us to study the mobility shift patterns at a higher level of resolution (Fig.3 A). In addition to the three major complexes b, b1, and b2 observed in agarose gels (Fig. 2), two additional complexes b0 and b10 could be resolved (Fig. 3 A). As with whole serum, increasing amounts of partially purified active material in the preincubation reaction lead to a gradual increase in the amount of complex b2 at the expense of all other bands, which were progressively eliminated from the mobility shift pattern. At very high concentrations of material purified from human serum there was also a gradual decrease in complex b2 (Fig.3 A). To demonstrate that the changes in the mobility shift patterns were indeed because of proteolytic digestion of the CTCF protein, we proceeded with separation of the treated nuclear extract and analysis of the resulting fractions by mobility shift electrophoresis and Western blotting. Initially, nuclear extract in preparative quantities was treated with heparin-agarose-purified active material. This resulted in a mobility shift pattern where the prominent complexes b, b1, and b2, as well as minor complexes b0 and b10, were represented (Fig.3 B, lane 1). The treated extract was loaded on a cation exchange column, and all proteins generating the mobility shift complexes eluted in fractions 19–24 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–8). This purification step considerably reduced total protein concentration in the preparation, and the combined fractions 19–23 (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3–7) were used as starting material (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) for subsequent gel filtration. Fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration was performed using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 6 column. Mobility shift analysis of the loading material (Fig. 4 A, lane 1) revealed the presence of all binding complexes that were observed prior to the cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). Meanwhile, Western blot analysis of the cation exchange-purified material with antibodies against either the N- (Fig.4 B) or C-terminal (Fig. 4 C) end of CTCF recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa (band p) corresponding to native CTCF (Fig. 4, B and C,lanes 1 and 2). Antibodies against the N-terminal part of the protein also reacted with a 120-kDa band [p0], as well as with a much less pronounced band at 130 kDa [p01] (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). In contrast, antibodies against the C-terminal end of CTCF recognized a new 70-kDa (p1) immunoreactive band (Fig. 4 C,lane 2). The emergence of these lower molecular weight bands that are differentially recognized by antibodies either against the C-terminal or the N-terminal end proves that CTCF indeed undergoes proteolytic cleavage during incubation with the purified fraction of serum. Gel filtration of the fragments allowed an estimation of the number and relative positions of the cleavage sites. Both antibodies recognized the peak of intact CTCF that eluted in fractions 13 and 14 (Fig. 4,B and C, lanes 4 and 5). This represented an apparent molecular mass of 400 kDa as determined by calibration with globular protein standards. The corresponding binding complex b was observed in the same fractions by mobility shift electrophoresis (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2 and 3). Fragment p0 eluted in fractions 15 and 16 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 6 and 7), generating the corresponding binding complex b0 (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 5). Furthermore, fragment p1 eluted in fractions 17 and 18 (Fig. 4 C,lanes 8 and 9) where the matching complex b1 was observed (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and 7). The CTCF fragments corresponding to the complexes b10 and b2, which eluted in fractions 19–21, could not be recognized by either antibody (Fig. 4 A,lanes 8–10; B and C, lanes 9–11). According to both SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, the CTCF fragment producing the faint band p01 migrated to a position between the full-length CTCF and fragment p0 (Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 6). However, no binding complex has been identified that could be assigned to this fragment, presumably because its low prevalence does not allow detection. Alternatively, the hypothetical binding complex formed by p01 may not be separable from binding complexes b and b0 under the applied mobility shift electrophoresis conditions. Assuming that CTCF binds to DNA as a monomer (10Köhne A.C. Baniahmad A. Renkawitz R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the results of the gel filtration suggest that there are three prominent proteolytic cleavage sites on the CTCF molecule. One site is located between the N terminus and the zinc finger DNA binding domain, and two are located between the zinc finger domain and the C terminus (Fig. 4 D,arrows). Incomplete cleavage at these sites would produce numerous protein fragments. Among them, the fragments p0, p01, p1, p10, and p2, which are schematically shown in Fig. 4 D, would contain the zinc finger domain and produce the corresponding binding complexes. Fragments p0 and p01 would be recognized by the N-terminal but not the C-terminal antibody. Similarly, protein p1 would be only recognized by the C-terminal antibody. Finally, neither antibody would recognize the proteins p10and p2 that produce binding complexes b10 and b2. Depending on the conditions of the cleavage reaction, additional minor binding complexes could be observed on the mobility shift gel between the b1 and b2 bands. An arrowhead in Fig. 4 A (fraction 18) indicates an example of such a weak binding complex, designated b3. Incidentally, an exceedingly weak band (p31) that reacted with the C-terminal antibody was detected migrating slightly ahead of fragment p1 in fractions 17 and 18 (Fig. 4 C,arrowheads). This suggests the existence of an additional cleavage site on the CTCF molecule in close proximity to the major site that cleaves off the N terminus generating fragment p1(Fig. 4 D, arrowhead). Cleavage at that site would generate three additional hypothetical CTCF protein fragments containing the zinc finger DNA binding domain (Fig. 4 D, fragments p31, p32, and p33, indicated by a bracket). Fragment p31 would thus retain an intact C-terminal sequence of CTCF and therefore react with antibodies against the C terminus. The same fragment could conceivably account for the appearance of the minor binding complex b3observed in fraction 18 on the mobility shift gel. Because of the lower prevalence of CTCF protein cleavage at this site, it is possible for example that it only becomes accessible after cleavage at the N-terminal p1 site. However, we consider it to be a marginal cleavage site for the protease, and we therefore disregard it in the further discussion of the results. Initial attempts to further purify the protease under nondenaturing conditions were unsuccessful. Employing a variety of separation techniques, we observed the same major proteins were co-purified. Preliminary results indicated that the protease probably exists in serum as part of a high molecular weight multiprotein complex (data not shown). Therefore, we proceeded with the protease identification using preparative SDS-PAGE. Proteins eluted from the heparin-agarose column were separated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig.5 A, lane 1). Four major protein bands (pp1-pp4) were extracted from the gel and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Under nonreducing conditions the extracted proteins produced homogenous bands (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–5). Treatment with β-mercaptoethanol differentially affected the electrophoretic behavior of proteins pp1-pp4 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 7–10). In particular, protein pp2 migrated as a single 70-kDa band under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5 A,lane 3), whereas in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol it produced two bands with molecular masses of ∼44 and 30 kDa (Fig.5 A, lane 8). The extracted proteins were renatured and incubated with nuclear extract, followed by mobility shift electrophoresis (Fig.5 B, lanes 1–4). Proteolytic activity was detected only in the sample containing the pp2 protein (Fig.5 B, lane 2). As a control, the total heparin-agarose-purified protease fraction was denatured under reducing, as well as nonreducing, conditions and then renatured while omitting electrophoretic separation. Proteolytic activity could only be restored from the nonreduced sample (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 6). From these experiments we conclude that the proteolytic activity is associated with the 70-kDa protein pp2. This protein comprises two polypeptide chains with apparent molecular masses of 44 and 30 kDa, which are connected via disulphide bonds. Disruption of the bonds irreversibly abolishes activity. To further characterize and identify the protease, the heparin-agarose-purified material was subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by Amido Black staining. Both the 44- and 30-kDa proteins were excised, and the N-terminal sequences of the proteins were determined. The 44- and 30-kDa proteins contained the sequences SLLESLDPDTP and IYGGFKSTAGAKHP, respectively, and they displayed a perfect match with the sequence of the human PHBP protein described by Choi-Miura et al.(12Choi-Miura N.-H. Tobe T. Sumiya J.-I. Nakano Y. Sano Y. Mazda T. Tomita M. J. Biochem. 1996; 119: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PHBP cDNA sequence data (12Choi-Miura N.-H. Tobe T.

In such a case the active center of the protease might form a covalent bond with DFP. To provide additional evidence that the protease is PHBP, we performed [3H]DFP labeling of the protease. We incubated the"
