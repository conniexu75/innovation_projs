https://openalex.org/W1579399439,"Abstract Rabbit muscle adenylate kinase is potently inhibited by P1,P5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate (Ap5A) but not by the homologs of this compound with fewer phosphoryl groups in the polyphosphate bridge and not by adenosine 5'-pentaphosphate. The inhibition by Ap5A is competitive with respect to both of the substrates, AMP and ATP. The association constant for the binding of Ap5A to adenylate kinase is about 4 x 108 m-1 at 24° and pH 8.0."
https://openalex.org/W1557923320,"We conclude that population fluctuations in Microtus in southern Indiana are produced by a syndrome of changes in birth and death rates similar to that found in other species of voles and lemmings. The mechanisms which cause the changes in birth and death rates are demolished by fencing the population so that no dispersal can occur. Dispersal thus seems critical for population regulation in Microtus. Because most dispersal occurs during the increase phase of the population cycle and there is little dispersal during the decline phase, dispersal is not directly related to population density. Hence the quality of dispersing animals must be important, and we have found one case of increased dispersal tendency by one genotype."
https://openalex.org/W1548361323,"Abstract 1. Vesicles catalyzing 32Pi-ATP exchange and ATP-driven proton translocation were reconstituted with chemically defined phospholipids and mitochondrial membrane proteins which were virtually free of electron transport carriers. 2. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were both required for the reconstitution of vesicles with high exchange activity. The optimal ratio of the two phospholipids was variable depending on the source and composition of the phospholipids. With highly purified preparations a 3- to 4-fold excess of phosphatidylethanolamine over phosphatidylcholine yielded optimal rates. An equal molar ratio gave low exchange activity, which was markedly accelerated by low amounts of cardiolipin or another acidic phospholipid. Coenzyme Q10 was not required. 3. Synthetic preparations substituted for natural phospholipids. The presence of unsaturated fatty acyl groups in the phospholipid appeared to be essential for the reconstitution of active vesicles. Phospholipids with fully saturated acyl groups were actually inhibitory. On the other hand, phospholipids with unnatural side chains were active provided they contained unsaturated groups. 4. The morphology of the reconstituted vesicles as seen in electron micrographs varied with the different phospholipids used in reconstitution. 5. Optimal conditions of reconstitution of the components which were solubilized with cholate were studied with [carboxy-14C]cholate. Rapid removal of cholate by passage of the components through a Sephadex column resulted in inactive particles. Removal of cholate by dialysis over several hours was optimal. The reconstituted vesicles had a higher phospholipid content and lower proton permeability than sub-mitochondrial particles."

By using animals deficient in both zinc and vitamin A, it was demonstrated that zinc is necessary for normal mobilization of vitamin A from the liver. These results suggest that cases of depressed vitamin A in plasma, unresponsive to vitamin A therapy, may respond to zinc supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W1517886671,"Abstract The mold metabolites, cytochalasin A and B, have been shown to be potent inhibitors of 2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake in cultured cells (Kletzien, R. F., Perdue, J. F., and Springer, A. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2964–2966). Cytochalasin B also inhibits the uptake of d-galactose and d-glucosamine in chick embryo fibroblasts at concentrations similar to those used to inhibit the uptake of 2-deoxy-d-glucose. A concentration of cytochalasin B which inhibited 50% of sugar uptake did not affect the ability of the cells to concentrate 2-deoxy-d-glucose as the phosphorylated sugar nor did the drug inhibit the phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-d-glucose by cellular homogenates. Therefore, the inhibition of sugar uptake by cytochalasin B was due to an inhibition of transport across the plasma membrane. This inhibition was analyzed by three methods and was of the linear competitive type with an apparent dissociation constant (Ki) for the inhibitor-carrier complex of 1.45 x 10-7 m."
https://openalex.org/W1998841938,Dopamine-β-hydroxylase activity is released into the blood with catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves. This enzyme activity has been measured in the blood of 317 normal children and 227 normal adults. A significant sibling-sibling correlation of serum dopamine-β-hydroxylase values was found in the 94 sibling pairs tested. Frequency distributions of serum enzyme values in both children and adults suggest the existence of two populations with regard to serum activity of this enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1493348989,"Abstract Incubation of rat epididymal adipose tissue fragments with insulin led to increases of up to 2.4-fold in the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase subsequently assayed in tissue homogenates. The activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by insulin was greatest when tissue was incubated in the presence of bicarbonate ions and when 2 mg of glucose or fructose per ml was added to the incubation medium. Several other agents known to inhibit lipolysis and to decrease cyclic AMP levels in fat cells, including niacin, 5-methylpyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, and prostaglandin E1 were also effective in activating pyruvate dehydrogenase. Severe depletion of tissue ATP levels caused by the addition of oligomycin or dinitrophenol, by anaerobic incubation, or by prolonged incubation with epinephrine in the absence of albumin also activated pyruvate dehydrogenase. Incubation of adipose tissue with 1 mm oleate, 1.5 mm octanoate, 1.5 mm heptanoate, 1 mm butyrate, or 3 mm dl-β-hydroxybutyrate decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity 20 to 70%. The addition of 5 mm acetate, 5 mm propionate, or 3 mm 4-pentenoate led to 70 to 160% activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, whereas 1.5 mm pentanoate had no effect. High concentrations of glucose (20 mg per ml) or of pyruvate-lactate (5 and 30 mm, respectively) also increased tissue pyruvate dehydrogenase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1499050330,"Abstract γ-Glutamyl cyclotransferase activity was found in homogenates of 11 rat tissues (kidney, liver, testes, spleen, brain, lung, heart, thymus, thyroid, skeletal muscle, and adrenal); two forms of the enzyme separable by starch gel electrophoresis were found in all tissues examined. l-γ-Glutamyl-l-glutamine and l-γ-glutamyl-l-methionine were the most active of nine substrates studied. The two enzyme forms present in rat liver were separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and found to exhibit the same molecular weight (about 27,000) and similar substrate specificity. However, the substrate specificity of the two isolated γ-glutamyl cyclotransferases was different from that of the liver homogenate and data were obtained indicating that the specificity of the enzyme changes during isolation and on storage at low temperature. Changes in the electrophoretic pattern are also observed after such storage. In general, the observed changes in specificity were decreases in activity toward γ-glutamylglutamine and other γ-glutamyl amino acids and either no change or a moderate increase in activity toward γ-glutamyl-γ-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide. The findings suggest that the changes in specificity are associated with a process (possibly limited proteolysis) that modifies the enzyme in such a manner as to alter that portion of the active site that binds the amino acid moiety of the γ-glutamyl amino acid substrate; the portion of the active site that binds the γ-glutamyl moiety appears to be modified relatively less."
https://openalex.org/W1944506335,"Abstract The rate of reduction of the disulfide bonds of peptides and proteins by dithiothreitol can be determined by measuring, as a function of time, the absorbance at 310 nm of the oxidized dithiothreitol formed. The method is rapid and can produce a complete kinetic curve with 0.1 µmole of disulfide. Results obtained with oxidized glutathione, ribonuclease, bovine serum albumin and α-lactalbumin show that the correct stoichiometry is obtained for the reaction. All four of the disulfide bonds of α-lactalbumin are shown to be readily available for reduction by 10-3 m dithiothreitol in aqueous buffers at room temperature. At temperatures near 0°, three of the four disulfides are no longer susceptible to reduction. Thus the conformation of the α-lactalbumin molecule is altered in a dramatic way over this temperature range."
https://openalex.org/W1589811025,"Abstract A thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21) associated with mitochondria has been demonstrated in tissue culture both in wild type mouse cells and in cells which lack the cytoplasmic thymidine kinase. The mitochondrial thymidine kinase represents approximately 1% of the total cell thymidine kinase activity in wild type cells grown in culture and all of the activity of the mutant cells. The mitochondrial enzyme can be distinguished from the cytoplasmic enzyme on the basis of its Km for thymidine and its localization on the mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, the presence of the enzyme in the mitochondria of the mutant cells results in exclusive labeling of mitochondrial DNA when the cells are grown in the presence of [3H]thymidine. Labeling studies in the presence and absence of methotrexate (an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase) demonstrate that, in the presence of exogenously added thymidine, both the product of the mitochondrial thymidine kinase and thymidine nucleotides synthesized in the cell cytoplasm are incorporated into mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1486481680,"Abstract Five enzymes from Flavobacterium heparinum, capable of degrading heparin to its basic constituents, have been purified and characterized. The purified heparinase degrades heparin to trisulfated disaccharide with a yield of 70 to 80%. The trisulfated disaccharide is desulfated by a disaccharide sulfoesterase yielding the disulfated disaccharide. This product is then a substrate for the glycuronidase forming glucosamine-2,6-disulfate and α,β-keto acid. Glucosamine-2,6-disulfate is desulfated by a sulfoesterase and a sulfamidase yielding free glucosamine and inorganic sulfate. The substrate specificity of these enzymes led to the formulation of a pathway for the sequential degradation of heparin. It was shown, by the action of these purified enzymes, that the trisulfated disaccharide is one of the fundamental structural units of heparin."
https://openalex.org/W1514339914,"Abstract The rate of formation of the stable trypsin-inhibitor complex from bovine β-trypsin and either virgin or modified soybean trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz) was monitored by following the change in absorbance at 260 nm after mixing of equimolar reactants in a stopped flow apparatus. At low reactant concentrations both reactions are second order both with respect to concentration and to time. As the concentration of reactants is raised both the time and concentration dependence gradually switch to first order. These results coupled with other data suggest that the simplest possible mechanism of interaction is [see PDF for equation] On the assumption that the equilibration to form the loose noncovalent complexes is rapid, values of Kl* = κ-1/κ1 and Kl* = κ4/κ-4 and of the rate constants κ2 and κ-3 were computed from the data. Within the limits of rather large experimental error pKl = pKl* = 4.65 independent of pH in the 4.5 to 8 range. The rate constants κ2 and κ-3 increase with increasing pH in this range and reach plateau values of 140 and 10 per s, respectively, near pH 8. Both rate constants show similar pH dependence with another plateau in the pH 5 to 6 range. The magnitude and pH dependence of these parameters is roughly consistent with Ks values and catalytic rate constants for hydrolysis of excellent amide and peptide substrates. Measurements of the dissociation of the stable complex between pH 1.7 and 3.5 were also made. The dissociation rate constant is very fast near pH 2 (approximately 100 per s) and declines sharply as the pH is raised. Preliminary measurements indicate significant differences in the rate of association of soybean trypsin inhibitor with α- and with β-trypsin as well as in the rate of dissociation of α-trypsin and of β-trypsin complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1608363916,"Abstract The metabolism of 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α, 17β-diol was studied in the microsomal fraction of livers from adult male and female rats after castration and treatment with various steroid hormones and drugs. In intact male control rats 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α, 17β-diol was hydroxylated in positions 2α, 2β, 7α, 7β, and 18, whereas female control rats only hydroxylated in positions 2α and 7α. Castration had no effect on the activities of the 2α- and 7α-hydroxylase systems in female rats but led to decreased activities of the 2α-, 2β-, 7β-, and 18-hydroxylase systems in male rats. The activities of these four enzyme systems were restored by treatment with testosterone propionate, 5α-dihydrotestosterone and 5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol but similar treatment of castrated female rats had a very small effect on the hydroxylase activities and demonstrated a relative androgen unresponsiveness in postpubertal female rats. The 7α-hydroxylase system active on 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α, 17β-diol was more active in female rats; this enzyme system was found to be primarily regulated by nongonadal factors and only slightly affected by androgens. Treatment of castrated male rats with estradiol benzoate led to a complete feminization of the activities of the liver microsomal hydroxylase systems. The activities of all hydroxylase systems active on 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α, 17β-diol in both male and female rats decreased in incubations carried out in the presence of carbon monoxide indicating that carbon monoxide binding pigments were involved in all hydroxylations studied. Administration of phenobarbital and 16α-cyanopregnenolone to castrated male and female rats led to increased activities of all hydroxylase systems in both sexes even if quantitative sexual differences in responses were observed. Methylcholanthrene treatment specifically stimulated 7αhydroxylation, especially in female rats. It is speculated that 7α-hydroxylation of 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α, 17β-diol is mainly carried out with cytochrome P-448 as the hemoprotein component and that the 2α-, 2β-, 7β-, and 18-hydroxylase systems mainly use cytochrome P-450 as hemoprotein. The hydroxylation of 5α-[4-14C]androstane-3α, 17β-diol was also studied in male and female rats 0, 7, 18, 28, 35, 42, and 56 days of age. No sexual differences were found in prepubertal rats and in these animals 2α-, 2β-, 7α-, and 18-hydroxylations were of the same order of magnitude as in adult male rats and regulated by nongonadal factors. At the time of puberty, sexual differences were found to develop and the control of the activities of the 2α-, 2β-, 7α-, and 18-hydroxylase systems changed from nongonadal to androgenic regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1554537480,"Abstract Reconstitution of the α and β subunits of human hemoglobin from separated α- and β-globin chains is described. The absorption and circular dichroism spectra, sedimentation coefficients, and sulfhydryl reactivities of the reconstituted subunits are compared with those of native subunits, which are regenerated from their p-mercuribenzoate chains by a novel procedure. The reconstituted subunits specifically recombine with the complementary native ones. Each property of the α subunit agrees, within experimental uncertainty, with the corresponding one of the subunit from which heme was never removed. Thus, markedly disordered and aggregated α-globin is restored to the highly ordered, monomeric α subunit upon recombination with 1 eq of hemin or hemin dicyanide. The reconstituted β subunit also compares well with the native subunit, except for a minor difference in a portion of the near-ultraviolet circular dichroism spectrum and a diminished sulfhydryl reactivity. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed. In the met form neither reconstituted subunit forms hemochromogen for several days, whereas the original met subunits become denatured within hours, probably owing to the necessity of exposing the latter, but not the former, to ferricyanide ion in producing the met forms. It is shown that while α- and β-globins do not combine at 4° (Yip, Y. K., Waks, M., and Beychok, S. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 7237), recombination does occur if either chain contains heme. The recombination produces half-filled (HF) molecules which are of two kinds, depending on which chain contains heme. The moleclar weights of these molecules are different. HFα, the intermediate prepared by mixing α subunits with β-globin, is a dimer; HFβ, the intermediate containing heme on its β chains, is a tetramer. No interchange of heme among chains occurs in the cyanmet forms in either molecule. In each, moreover, the conformation of the heme-free chain differs from that of the same chain when unbound. Both HF molecules bind 1 eq of heme, producing tetrameric hemoglobin. The most dramatic finding in this work is that the disordered α-globin can be refolded not only by binding heme but also by combining with a β subunit, although the refolding in the latter case is not as complete as in the former. These results show that the primary sequences of the globin chains generate unstable conformations, which are stabilized by combination with heme. They demonstrate also that refolding of a polypeptide chain can be induced by interaction with a neighboring subunit in an assembly process."

The ability of phase shifts in the lighting schedule to induce concomitant changes in the rhythm was used to determine the spectral sensitivity of the retinal photoreceptor systems mediating rhythm entrainment. Green light (lambda = 530 +/- 45 nanometers) was most potent, and red (lambda = 660 +/- 19 nanometers) and ultraviolet (lambda = 360 +/- 34 nanometers) were least potent in entraining the temperature rhythm."

Neither the serum obtained from the guinea pig before hyperimmunization with the herpesvirus nonvirion antigen nor the antiserum of guinea pigs immunized with comparable uninfected cell extracts reacted with these tumor soluble membrane antigens. Since the above soluble membrane antigens could be specific markers for the presence of virus genome within the tumor cells, the findings could support an etiological role of herpesvirus in selected human malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W1496082874,"Abstract An enzyme system from Torulopsis utilis consisting of microsomal pellet and supernatant (100,000 x g) catalyzes the conversion of either oleyl-CoA or oleyl phospholipid to linoleate. The desaturation of oleyl phospholipid has been demonstrated both with biosynthetic and chemically synthesized substrate. Incubation of Torulopsis particles with [3H]-oleyl-CoA in the absence of supernatant affords [3H]-oleyl phospholipid. This material is desaturated to linoleate either in situ after addition of supernatant or, after isolation, by the complete enzyme system. Fractionation of the biosynthetic [3H]oleyl lipid indicates that oleyl phosphatidylcholine is the most active of the various phospholipid fractions for desaturation. Synthetic 1,2-di[14C]oleyl phosphatidylcholine is converted to linoleate with high efficiency. Linoleate formation from either biosynthetic or chemically synthesized oleyl phospholipid requires both the particulate fraction and the supernatant from Torulopsis extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1482511040,"Fatty acid biosynthesis has been studied using primary cultures of human skin fibroblasts. Acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase activity of cells incubated in medium containing 15% fetal calf serum was 0.17 ± 0.01 nmole of malonyl coenzyme A formed per mg of protein per min whereas in cells incubated for 2 to 3 days in a medium with 15% lipid-deficient fetal calf serum acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity increased to a level of 0.29 ± 0.02 nmole of malonyl-CoA formed per mg of protein per min. Equivalence point determinations using an antibody against acetyl-CoA carboxylase indicate that the increase in enzyme activity results from increased enzyme content in the cells rather than from activation of preformed enzyme. The effect of lipid-deficient medium on acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was reversed by the addition of normal fetal calf serum or by the addition of any of a number of different albumin-bound free fatty acids to the lipid-deficient medium. When cells originally incubated in medium containing normal fetal calf serum were switched to medium containing lipid-deficient fetal calf serum, an 8-fold increase in the rate of acetate incorporation into lipid was observed in the first 7 hours, whereas cells switched from lipid-deficient to normal serum-containing medium or medium supplemented with free fatty acids showed an almost immediate decrease in the rate of acetate incorporation. The changes in acetate incorporation occurred before any change in enzyme activity was seen, indicating that two types of control are exerted on fatty acid biosynthesis in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1543079077,"Abstract A study has been made of the ability of insulin to stimulate the transport of l-[14C]alanine into paired intact rat hemidiaphragms in vitro, and the results have been compared with those obtained with α-amino[14C]isobutyrate and l-[14C]leucine. A variety of agents and conditions have been tested for their relative abilities to alter total saturable uptake of the amino acids on the one hand, and the insulin stimulation of uptake on the other. Transport of alanine (0.5 mm) was increased about 20% by the presence of insulin (0.1 unit per ml) under the conditions of the experiment. A 10 to 20 mm level of α-aminoisobutyrate eliminated the insulin stimulation of alanine uptake while decreasing its total saturable uptake by only about 10%. Leucine, in contrast, could inhibit at least three-fourths of the total saturable alanine uptake without decreasing the increment in uptake produced by insulin. Omitting Na+ from the incubation medium decreased total alanine uptake by about 60%, but abolished insulin stimulation. Decreasing the pH of the incubation medium progressively from 7.4 to 5.4 brought a regular reduction in the insulin stimulation, but at the same time the total saturable alanine uptake was increased. Other agents and conditions gave less sharp distinction between the transport systems used by alanine. α-Aminoisobutyrate transport was more than doubled by 0.1 unit of insulin per ml in 1 hour. The pattern of its inhibition by different conditions suggests that this amino acid is transported in diaphragm nearly completely by one system, which is Na+-dependent as well as sensitive to insulin. Leucine transport, on the other hand, showed relatively little response to insulin, and was essentially unaltered by changes in buffer [Na+] or pH, or by the presence of competitive inhibitors other than leucine and isoleucine. The results suggest that l-alanine enters rat diaphragm by at least three saturable routes. One is Na+-independent; another is Na+-dependent and sensitive to insulin; while the third is Na+-dependent but not affected by insulin. The insulin-sensitive route accounts for no more than about 10 to 20% of the total saturable uptake at the alanine levels used. These facts support the hypothesis that insulin acts on only one neutral amino acid transport system in diaphragm; and that the hormone does not increase alanine transport greatly in this tissue because alanine does not use the insulin-sensitive system extensively."
https://openalex.org/W2049759506,When the goldfish Mauthner cell fires an impulse there is a simultaneous hyperpolarization of adjacent medullary neurons as far as 200 micrometers from its soma. This hyperpolarization is due to an inward transmembrane flow of some of the current generated by the Mauthner cell spike and is sufficiently large to block spikes evoked both directly or transsynaptically.
https://openalex.org/W1516956925,"Abstract Prococoonases and cocoonases from three species of silkmoths (Antheraea pernyi, Antheraea polyphemus, and Antheraea mylitta) have been purified and compared to each other and to vertebrate trypsins by tryptic peptide mapping, amino acid and carbohydrate composition, and partial amino acid sequence. Comparison of tryptic peptide maps of two cocoonases with bovine trypsin shows 50% coincidence of peptides. The prococoonases from A. pernyi and A. polyphemus are glycoproteins containing 6 moles of mannose and 2 moles of glucosamine. Proteolytic activation of prococoonase to cocoonase does not involve a loss of any of this carbohydrate. Prococoonase from A. mylitta contains no carbohydrate. Sequence analyses of the NH2 and COOH termini of several cocoonases and A. mylitta prococoonase and the entire active site tryptic peptide from A. polyphemus cocoonase reveals 70% identity with bovine trypsin. The partial structure of A. polyphemus cocoonase is [see PDF for sequence] The active site serine is indicated by the box."
https://openalex.org/W1524462436,The first phase of the determination of the primary structure of chromatographically homogeneous bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease A has been the isolation of 23 principal peptides from tryptic digests of the reduced and alkylated protein and 20 peptides from a chymotryptic hydrolysate. Seven of the latter series provide information on the ordering of peptides of the tryptic series. The results provide the basis for the derivation of the structural formula of DNase A from the subsequent study of the products of cyanogen bromide cleavage reported in the accompanying paper. The determinations of the sequences of the peptides have been facilitated by a scaling down of the subtractive Edman procedure to the use of 1 to 2 nmoles of peptide per step through the use of amino acid analyzers operating in that range.

https://openalex.org/W1795048063,"Abstract The enzymatic reaction of porcine pancreatic lipase with insoluble monolayers of either trioctanoin or 1,2-dioctanoin can be followed quantitatively by monitoring the considerable change in surface pressure which occurs during the course of the reaction. The rate of each reaction is proportional to the surface concentration of the substrate. The calculated pseudo-first order rate constants are proportional to the enzyme concentration in the bulk solution. At pH 7.6, the value of the second order rate constant for the hydrolysis of the primary ester function in trioctanoin was found to be 8.46 x 105 m-1 s-1, and that for dioctanoin, 2.65 x 104 m-1 s-1. The pH dependency of the rate constant for dioctanoin hydrolysis reveals an ionizable basic group at the active site of the enzyme with pKa of 6.38. The results are consistent with fully hydrated enzyme molecules acting upon substrate molecules lying within the insoluble mono-layer."

One hour after a single injection of phenylalanine into the rat, the brains were removed and completely frozen in less than a second. The concentration of phenylalanine in the brain was comparable to that found in phenylketonuric patients. Changes in brain glycolytic intermediates were consistent with inhibition of pyruvate kinase in vivo. The inhibition of pyruvate kinase was apparently compensated for by an increase in phosphoenolpyruvate; no decrease in adenosine triphosphate or creatine phosphate was found."
https://openalex.org/W1537452821,"Utilization of serum triglycerides by cells in tissue culture has been studied in order to determine their importance as a source of cell lipids and to obtain information on the cellular mechanisms of triglyceride uptake. L strain mouse fibroblasts incorporated serum triglycerides from the growth medium, but the rates of uptake were up to 10-fold less than that of free fatty acids or monoglycerides under the same culture conditions. When cells were grown under conditions of limited supply of serum lipids, however, only about 7% of the cell lipid came from serum free fatty acids and up to 28% was provided by the serum triglycerides. The major portion of the cell lipid under these conditions was derived by de novo synthesis from glucose. Hydrolysis of exogenous triglyceride by lipases in the serum-supplemented tissue culture medium was measured and found to be inadequate to account for the rate of triglyceride utilization observed in these studies. In addition, heat treatment of the serum to inactivate lipase did not significantly affect triglyceride uptake. No excretion of lipase activity by the cells was detected. Incorporation of triglyceride labeled in the glycerol portion with 3H and the fatty acid portion with 14C was measured from untreated, heat-inactivated, or delipidized serum using both monolayers and growing cultures. The 3H:14C ratio in the isolated cellular lipids averaged over 70% of that in the original triglyceride under all conditions of culture. Furthermore, incorporation of the [3H]glycerol portion of the molecule was not diluted out by addition to the growth medium of a large excess of nonradioactive glycerol or a nonhydrolyzable monoglyceride analog. In short term uptake experiments most of the radioactivity in cell lipids was found in the triglyceride fraction, with only minor amounts in the free fatty acids. In long term growth experiments the incorporated triglyceride was converted extensively (70 to 80%) to cellular phospholipid with maintenance of the 3H:14C ratio. The results indicate that L cells in tissue culture can utilize serum triglycerides and suggest that the predominant mechanism of uptake involves the intact molecule and does not require prior hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1585700996,"Abstract A glycoprotein obtained from the maxillary galeae of the silkmoth Antheraea polyphemus has been established as the zymogen (prococoonase) of the proteolytic enzyme cocoonase. A study of the in vitro activation of prococoonase and comparison of the properties of the resultant product with those of the native enzyme have confirmed this relationship. This comparison revealed (a) identical electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gels, (b) identical molecular weights, (c) identical apparent Km values for the hydrolysis of Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester, (d) indistinguishable amino acid compositions, and (e) the same NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequence. The in vitro mechanism of activation of prococoonase by cocoonase was shown to be autocatalytic by kinetic analysis. Cocoonase also resulted from prococoonase activation by bovine trypsin, but the rate was 480 times faster than activation by cocoonase itself. Prococoonase was also activated by porcine enterokinase at about 75% the rate of the autocatalytic activation. Sedimentation equilibrium and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide electrophoresis of proenzyme and enzyme indicated a molecular weight difference of 2,000 to 3,500. By comparison of the NH2- and COOH-terminal amino acid sequences of prococoonase and cocoonase, it was concluded that activation involves the removal of a 13-residue peptide from the NH2-terminal end of prococoonase. The composition of this peptide is compared to other trypsinogen-trypsin activation peptides and an in vivo mechanism for prococoonase activation is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1500360992,Abstract The following sequence and the pairing of the half-cystine residues has been derived for bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease A. [see PDF for sequence] The sequence permits the following assignments of residues known to have special properties. The carbohydrate moiety is attached to Asn18. The crucial histidine residue subject to alkylation by iodoacetate is His131. The site of nitration when the enzyme is inactivated by tetranitromethane is Tyr62; the secondary site of nitration is Tyr73. The essential disulfide bond links residues 170 and 206.

https://openalex.org/W1522231620,"Abstract Bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease A was selectively cleaved by digestion with α-chymotrypsin under carefully controlled conditions. The peptide bond in DNase A between tryptophan residue 178 and serine 179 was quantitatively hydrolyzed in less than 15 min by 0.5% α-chymotrypsin at pH 8.5 and 4° when divalent metal ions were absent. The modified DNase A (DNase A (1–178,179–257)) was composed of two chains of molecular weights approximately 21,000 and 9,000 which were covalently linked by a disulfide bond. Enzymatically split DNase A retained about 70% of the activity of the native enzyme in the absence of calcium ions in the enzyme solution and exhibited nearly full activity when 20 mm CaCl2 was first added to the modified DNase. Enhancement of DNase A (1–178,179–257) activity by divalent calcium ions indicated that a greater functional dependence exists for Ca2+ in the modified DNase A than was observed with the native enzyme. The covalent linkage which connects the NH2- and COOH-terminal portions of DNase A (1–178,179–257) is formed between half-cystine residues 170 and 206. Reduction with mercaptoethanol inactivated both the native and cleaved DNase A. Unlike native DNase A, reduced DNase A (1–178,179–257) could not be reactivated by the addition of Ca2+ in the presence of 50 mm mercaptoethanol. Activity was restored to reduced DNase A (1–178,179–257), however, to the extent of 90% of that of the native enzyme when 20 mm CaCl2 was added to the reduced chains after the excess mercaptoethanol had been removed. DNase A (1–178,179–257) was further digested with a carboxypeptidase from yeast which quantitatively released 5 amino acid residues, all from the newly formed COOH terminus at position 178 in the modified enzyme. DNase A (1–173,179–257), produced by the carboxypeptidase from yeast, was more than 80% as active as native DNase A in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2. The sequence of residues 174 through 178 is known to be -Thr-Ser-Ser-Gln-Trp-, and threonine 174 is only 4 residues removed from the half-cystine residue at position 170 which participates in the essential —S—S— bond of DNase. These results indicate that a number of the amino acid residues located in the central portion of the peptide chain of DNase are structurally and functionally expendable. The fact that DNase A can be readily cleaved without loss of enzyme activity makes the possibility of proteolysis during preparation of the enzyme a very likely complication. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis, in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol, of a sample of DNase A prepared by chromatography on phosphocellulose, indicated the presence of two minor bands which corresponded to the chains from DNase A (1–178,179–257). Chromatography of DNase on DEAE-Sephadex and then a re-chromatography of the pooled DNase fraction on phosphocellulose led to a homogeneous DNase A which was stable at pH 8.0."
https://openalex.org/W1567153826,"Abstract DesHis (146β) hemoglobin is a β chain modification of human hemoglobin in which the COOH-terminal histidine 146β has been removed by digestion with carboxypeptidase B. Previous crystallographic investigations of the structures of desHis deoxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin Hiroshima (His 146β → Asp) suggest that the atomic structures of these derivatives differ from each other and from hemoglobin A only in the immediate environment of the COOH-terminal residue. Kinetic studies of the binding of oxygen, carbon monoxide, and n-butyl isocyanide to desHis hemoglobin reveal that the properties of desHis hemoglobin and hemoglobin Hiroshima are indeed similar, but not identical; the properties of both differ appreciably from those of hemoglobin A. These qualitative differences in kinetic properties are not readily reconciled with the apparently minor structural differences revealed in the structural studies. They suggest rather that the unliganded forms of both derivatives adopt a new conformation, or series of conformations in slow equilibrium, which are distinct from the conformations of either deoxy- or oxyhemoglobin A."
https://openalex.org/W1650238836,"Abstract The proton magnetic resonance relaxation rate (PRR) of water in ternary complexes of pyruvate kinase-Mn(II) with P-enolpyruvate and P-enol-α-ketobutyrate has been examined in the presence of various monovalent cations by titration of pyruvate kinase-Mn(II) with either P-enolpyruvate or P-enol-α-ketobutyrate. The calculated dissociation constants of the substrate and of the enzyme from the enzyme-metal-substrate complexes, K3 and K2 respectively, and the enhancement of the ternary P-enolpyruvate complex (et) were found to depend upon the monovalent cation present. The results are interpreted in terms of an equilibrium mixture of the two known conformational forms of the ternary P-enolpyruvate complex in the presence of nonactivating (CH3)4N+. In the presence of activating K+, only one ternary species exists which is the same as the major conformational species formed with (CH3)4N+. By the EPR criterion, the substrate analog P-enol-α-ketobutyrate forms only one species of the enzyme-Mn(II)-substrate complex in the presence of either (CH3)4N+ or K+ and, unlike the P-enol-pyruvate complex, the value of et for the analog complex is independent of monovalent cation. It is concluded that the monovalent cation affects only the equilibrium between the two conformational species of the P-enolpyruvate complex and that the enhancement of the major conformational form is invariant with monovalent cation. From the fact that the PRR enhancement et of the minor conformational form (∼17) is much closer to that of the binary metal-enzyme complex (eb = 22.5) than to that of the ternary K+ complex (et = 2.3), it is inferred that the Mn(II) active site environment of the minor conformational form closely resembles that of the binary complex. PRR titrations for the P-enolpyruvate complex have yielded a stoichiometry of 3.5 P-enolpyruvate sites per molecule of pyruvate kinase. Temperature and frequency dependence studies of the water PRR for the ternary P-enolpyruvate complex in the presence of K+ bracketed the correlation time for the dipolar interaction between Mn(II) and the water protons: 0.7 x 10-9 s ≤ τc l 2.6 x 10-9 s. In the presence of (CH3)4N+, the water PRR for the ternary P-enolpyruvate complex is frequency-dependent. The frequency-dependent component is identified with the minor conformational species present only in (CH3)4N+ solutions. The number, n, of water molecules in the first coordination sphere of Mn(II) of the ternary P-enolpyruvate complex in the presence of K+ was calculated to be 0.2 ≤ n ≤ 0.5. The low value of n is discussed in terms of possible structural features of the enzyme-metal-substrate complex."
https://openalex.org/W1583101852,"Abstract Peptide maps obtained with tryptic-chymotryptic hydrolysates of bovine pancreatic DNases A, B, and C show a high degree of similarity. The map for DNase C, however, shows one peptide to have moved to a significantly less basic position. The peptide in question was isolated from hydrolysates of A and C and its sequence determined in each instance. The results show that DNase C contains a proline residue at the position occupied by histidine-118 in the 257-residue sequence of DNase A. The results confirm the conclusion, initially based on the amino acid compositions of DNases A and C, that the two forms differ by a residue change that could arise from a single base change in the relevant gene. Histidine-118 in DNase A is thus not a residue essential to the activity of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1578511691,"Abstract A procedure is presented for the purification from human plasma of two homogeneous and non-interconvertible forms of ceramide trihexosidase, designated Form A-1 and Form A-2. These enzymes exhibit the same electrophoretic characteristics on isoelectric focusing and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They have molecular weights of about 95,000, as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration, and consist of subunits with molecular weights of about 22,000. They are similar in heat stability, although Form A-2 retains 25% of its activity after boiling for 30 min, whereas Form A-1 is completely inactivated under the same conditions. Form A-1 is soluble in butanol and retains enzymatic activity in the organic solvent; Form A-2 retains enzymatic activity in 20% butanol but is not partitioned into the upper phase in a butanol-water system. Neither enzyme has any demonstrable activity with p-nitrophenyl-α-galactoside. The kinetic characteristics of Form A-1 ceramide trihexosidase can be summarized as follows. (a) In the absence of sodium taurocholate and sodium chloride, the enzyme has sigmoidal kinetics, whereas the kinetics are hyperbolic in the presence of 0.03 m sodium taurocholate and 0.15 m sodium chloride, with half-maximal velocity at a substrate concentration of 4.5 x 10-4 m. (b) In the presence of optimal sodium taurocholate and sodium chloride, the enzyme is competitively inhibited by digalactosylceramide and the trisaccharide derived from the lipid substrate. (c) In the absence of sodium taurocholate and sodium chloride, digalactosyl ceramide is an activator at low substrate concentrations and an inhibitor at high substrate concentrations. (d) The enzyme is not inhibited by lactosylceramide, galactose, myo-inositol, p-nitrophenyl-α-galactoside, or 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-galactoside. (e) The enzyme becomes inactive when concentrated above 1.68 x 10-7 m in an incubation. The kinetic characteristics of Form A-2 ceramide trihexosidase are as follows. (a) In the absence of sodium taurocholate and sodium chloride, the enzyme exhibits sigmoidal kinetics, whereas the kinetics are hyperbolic in the presence of 0.04 m sodium taurocholate and 0.15 m sodium chloride, with half-maximal velocity at a substrate concentration of 5 x 10-4 m. (b) The enzyme is inhibited by the products of the reaction, galactose and lactosylceramide. (c) The enzyme is competitively inhibited by myo-inositol, digalactosylceramide, and the trisaccharide derived from the lipid substrate. (d) The enzyme is not inhibited by p-nitrophenyl-α-galactoside or 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-galactoside under the conditions of the experiment. (e) The enzyme becomes inactive when concentrated."

https://openalex.org/W1501769001,"Abstract A cobalt (III)-protoporphyrin IX complex of horse globin (cobaltiglobin) has been prepared and its stability toward acid denaturation determined. Unlike iron(III) protoporphyrin, which combines with globin to give ferrihemoglobin, cobalt(III) protoporphyrin combines with globin to give a complex which experimentally resembles an internal ferrihemichrome in which the heme is attached to the protein by two metal protein bonds. The evidence for this conclusion is that, unlike ferrihemoglobin, cobaltiglobin does not combine with cyanate, thiocyanate, fluoride, or azide. It does combine with cyanide, although slowly. It has no ionizable water coordinated to the metal. No significant change in spectrum occurs in 12 hours at pH values as low as pH 3.65, but pH-stat experiments reveal that two basic groups per dimer are slowly unmasked at pH values as high as pH 5. Unlike the denaturation of all other hemoglobin complexes studied, the pH profile of cobaltiglobin shows that the denaturation rate is only slightly dependent on pH (proportional to about [H+]0.37). The effect of temperature is small also. Unlike the heme in ferrihemoglobin, the cobalt(III) porphyrin remains attached to the polypeptide chain when the latter is unfolded. In this respect it resembles CO-hemoglobin. The observed data are compatible with the internal hemichrome formulation and indicate that substitution of the metal can have a profound influence on the structure of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1517532350,"Abstract Activation of acetylcholinesterase by divalent cations and some quaternary ammonium compounds is believed to be mediated through allosteric anionic sites. Treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid did not affect either basal catalytic activity or Ca2+ activation of the enzyme. Alkylating agents of the haloethylamine type and the poorly water-soluble carboxyl group reagents, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, inhibited basal catalytic activity as well as Ca2+ activation. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride, a water-soluble carbodiimide, almost totally inhibited activation by Ca2+, gallamine triethiode, and tetraethylammonium iodide in about 4 hours at pH 7.4, at a concentration of 2 mm, whereas under these conditions the carbodiimide had little effect on basal catalytic activity. It is concluded that this water-soluble carbodiimide is an an affinity reagent which reacts with carboxyl groups outside the immediate vicinity of the active site. This carboxyl group modification in some way uncouples allosteric effects of ligands from catalytic activity."

E. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1301–1306), has been examined further by testing the substrate properties of peptide derivatives of α-, β-, and γ-methyglutamine isomers. The fact that only the peptide derivatives of α-methyl-l-glutamine are substrates is consistent with our original proposal. The finding of no detectable activity toward α-methyl-d-glutamine derivatives, together with the earlier observation of a strong preference of the enzyme toward l-glutamine residues, has led to a suggestion that l-glutamine substrates attach to the active site of transglutaminase with the α-hydrogen of the glutamine residue projecting away from the enzyme surface."

https://openalex.org/W2124341609,"Abstract The visible and ultraviolet circular dichroic (CD) spectra resulting from the interaction of ribonuclease with successive Cu(II) ions have been recorded under a variety of conditions. At pH 7 in the presence of 0.16 m KCl a broad, negative band was found in the visible region. This band increased in intensity and changed in shape as successive coppers were added. The circular dichroic spectra could be analyzed in terms of two kinds of binding sites: a single strong site with CD minimum at about 710 nm, and four weaker sites with CD minimum at about 600 nm. The binding constants observed are close to those obtained by more conventional means. Carboxymethylation of one histidine results in loss of one of the weaker sites. In 0.01 m salt, only the 600-nm band is seen. Binding at pH 9.6 differed in that saturation did not occur until about 33 sites had been filled. The presence of tetra coordination at this pH was indicated by the shift of the primary d-d transition down to 530 nm. Additional structure in the visible and near ultraviolet CD was now present in the form of a negative band at 355 nm and, for the first two Cu(II)'s added, a positive one at 480 nm. Strong positive bands were observed at 251 and 305 nm for all pH values ≥7. These are tentatively ascribed to charge transfer complexes between Cu(II) and the peptide backbone. The relationship of the Cu(II)-ribonuclease CD spectra to those of natural, copper-containing metalloproteins, both blue and non-blue, is discussed, with special emphasis on the oxyhemocyanins."

The system encourages progress in the biomedical sciences through the continuous influx of creative individuals who can explore their own research ideas, ideas that also correspond to the health research needs of the nation as reflected by the categorical missions of the institutes. Despite the decline (approximately 20 percent) in the total number of active research projects over the past 7 years. the proportion of new PI's among all recipients of new awards remained fairly constant from year to year. From 1966 to 1972, an average of 57 percent of all new research project awards were received by PI's entering the system for the first time, while an average of approximately 10 percent of all the PI's on research projects each year were new PI's being supported by NIH for the first time."
