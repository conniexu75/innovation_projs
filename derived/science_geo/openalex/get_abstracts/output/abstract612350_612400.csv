Our results generate a global model whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall packaging of DNA in the nucleus. Although the same genomic DNA is packaged in the nucleus of each cell, different sets of genes are expressed in different cell states. Despite significant progress over the past decade, there are still many unanswered questions about how the genome is organized within the nucleus and how these structures change across different cell states. Current methods for genome-wide mapping of 3-dimensional (3D) genome structure rely on proximity ligation (e.g., Hi-C), which works by ligating the ends of DNA regions that are in close spatial proximity in the nucleus followed by sequencing to map pairwise interactions. These methods have shown that the genome is largely organized around chromosome territories, such that most DNA interactions occur within an individual chromosome (Gibcus and Dekker, 2013Gibcus J.H. Dekker J. The hierarchy of the 3D genome.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These interactions include chromatin loops that connect genomic DNA regions, such as enhancers and promoters, local-interacting neighborhoods of DNA called “topologically associated domains” (TADs), and compartments where DNA regions interact based on transcriptional activity (Pombo and Dillon, 2015Pombo A. Dillon N. Three-dimensional genome architecture: players and mechanisms.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Another widely used method for studying nuclear structure is microscopy, which involves in situ imaging of DNA, RNA, and protein in the nucleus. These methods have shown that specific regions of the genome, including specific inter-chromosomal interactions, can organize around nuclear bodies (Hu et al., 2010Hu Y. Plutz M. Belmont A.S. Hsp70 gene association with nuclear speckles is Hsp70 promoter specific.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 191: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For example, RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-transcribed rDNA genes, which are encoded on several distinct chromosomes, localize within the nucleolus (Pederson, 2011Pederson T. The nucleolus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 1-15Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In addition, specific examples of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-transcribed genes have been shown to localize near the periphery of nuclear speckles (Khanna et al., 2014Khanna N. Hu Y. Belmont A.S. HSP70 transgene directed motion to nuclear speckles facilitates heat shock activation.Curr. Biol. 2014; 24: 1138-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a nuclear body that contains various mRNA processing and splicing factors (Spector and Lamond, 2011Spector D.L. Lamond A.I. Nuclear speckles.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 1-12Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These observations and others (Branco and Pombo, 2006Branco M.R. Pombo A. Intermingling of chromosome territories in interphase suggests role in translocations and transcription-dependent associations.PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e138Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, Lomvardas et al., 2006Lomvardas S.

Interchromosomal interactions and olfactory receptor choice.Cell. 2006; 126: 403-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) demonstrate that genome interactions can occur beyond chromosome territories and organize around nuclear bodies. Yet, despite the power of each of these methods for mapping nuclear structure, there is a growing appreciation that microscopy and proximity ligation measure different aspects of genome organization (Giorgetti and Heard, 2016Giorgetti L. Heard E. Closing the loop: 3C versus DNA FISH.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 215Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Williamson et al., 2014Williamson I. Berlivet S. Eskeland R. Boyle S. Illingworth R.S. Paquette D. Dostie J. Bickmore W.A. Spatial genome organization: contrasting views from chromosome conformation capture and fluorescence in situ hybridization.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2778-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Specifically, microscopy measures the 3D spatial distances between DNA sites within single cells, whereas proximity ligation measures the frequency with which two DNA sites are close enough in the nucleus to directly ligate (Dekker, 2016Dekker J. Mapping the 3D genome: Aiming for consilience.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 741-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This difference is particularly significant when considering DNA regions that organize around nuclear bodies, which can range in size from 0.5 to 2 μm (Pederson, 2011Pederson T. The nucleolus.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3: 1-15Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and therefore may be too far apart to directly ligate. This may explain why proximity ligation methods do not identify known interactions between chromosomes that organize around specific nuclear bodies. These differences between proximity ligation and microscopy highlight a challenge for generating comprehensive maps of genome structure. Specifically, it remains unclear whether the specific inter-chromosomal interactions identified by microscopy represent special cases or broader principles of global genome organization. Additionally, both methods are limited to measuring simultaneous contacts between a small number (∼2–3) of genomic regions and therefore cannot measure how multiple DNA sites simultaneously organize within the nucleus (O’Sullivan et al., 2013O’Sullivan J.M. Hendy M.D. Pichugina T. Wake G.C. Langowski J. The statistical-mechanics of chromosome conformation capture.Nucleus. 2013; 4: 390-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Accordingly, current methods cannot generate a global picture of genome organization, which is critical for addressing key questions, such as why some specific Pol II-transcribed regions associate with nuclear speckles whereas others do not (Shopland et al., 2003Shopland L.S. Johnson C.V. Byron M. McNeil J. Lawrence J.B. Clustering of multiple specific genes and gene-rich R-bands around SC-35 domains: evidence for local euchromatic neighborhoods.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which DNA regions organize simultaneously around the same nuclear body, and how genomic DNA is organized in the nucleus relative to multiple nuclear bodies, chromosome territories, and other features. To address these technical challenges, we develop a method called “split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension” (SPRITE) that moves away from proximity ligation and enables genome-wide detection of multiple DNA interactions that occur simultaneously within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known genome structures identified by Hi-C, including chromosome territories, compartments, topologically associated domains, and loop structures, and identify that many of these occur within higher-order structures in the nucleus. Because SPRITE does not rely on proximity ligation, it identifies interactions that occur across larger spatial distances than can be observed by Hi-C. These long-range interactions include two major hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions. By extending SPRITE to simultaneously measure RNA and DNA interactions, we find that these two inter-chromosomal hubs correspond to DNA organization around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles, respectively. Moreover, DNA regions within these hubs can simultaneously organize around the same nuclear body within individual cells. We show that gene-dense and highly transcribed Pol II regions organize around nuclear speckles and that gene-poor, and therefore transcriptionally inactive, regions that are centromere-proximal organize around the nucleolus. In addition to the regions that directly associate with these nuclear bodies, we find that a substantial fraction of the genome exhibits preferential spatial positioning relative to each of these nuclear bodies. Importantly, these preferential spatial distances quantitatively correspond to functional and structural properties, including the density of active Pol II within a genomic region. Together, our results provide a global model of genome organization whereby nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall 3D packaging of DNA in the nucleus. We sought to develop a genome-wide method that enables mapping of higher-order interactions that occur simultaneously between multiple DNA sites within the same nucleus. To do this, we developed SPRITE, a method that does not rely on proximity ligation. SPRITE works as follows: DNA, RNA, and protein are crosslinked in cells; nuclei are isolated; chromatin is fragmented; interacting molecules within an individual complex are barcoded using a split-pool strategy; and interactions are identified by sequencing and matching all reads that contain identical barcodes (Figure 1A; STAR Methods). Specifically, we uniquely barcode each molecule in a crosslinked complex by repeatedly splitting all complexes across a 96-well plate (“split”), ligating a specific tag sequence onto all DNA molecules within each well (“tag”), and then pooling these complexes into a single well (“pool”). After several rounds of split-pool tagging, each molecule in an interacting complex contains a unique series of ligated tags, which we refer to as a barcode (Figure 1A). Because all molecules in a crosslinked complex are covalently linked, they will sort together in the same wells throughout each round of the split-pool tagging process and will contain the same barcode, whereas the molecules in separate complexes will sort independently and therefore will obtain distinct barcodes. Therefore, the probability that molecules in two independent complexes will receive the same barcode decreases exponentially with each additional round of split-pool tagging. For example, after six rounds of split-pool tagging, there are ∼1012 possible unique barcode sequences, which exceeds the number of unique DNA molecules present in the initial sample (∼109). After split-pool tagging, we sequence all tagged DNA molecules and match all reads with shared barcodes (STAR Methods). We refer to all unique DNA reads that contain the same barcode as a SPRITE cluster (Figure 1A). To confirm that DNA reads within a SPRITE cluster represent interactions that occur in the same nucleus and are not formed by spurious association or aggregation in solution, we mixed crosslinked lysates from human and mouse cells prior to performing SPRITE and found that ∼99.8% of all SPRITE clusters contained only human or mouse reads, but not both (Figure S1A; STAR Methods). SPRITE differs from previous methods in several ways. In contrast to Hi-C, SPRITE can measure multiple DNA molecules that simultaneously interact within an individual nucleus, can provide information about interactions that are heterogeneous from cell-to-cell, and is not restricted to measuring DNA interactions that are close enough in the nucleus to directly ligate. In contrast to genome architecture mapping (GAM) (Beagrie et al., 2017Beagrie R.A. Scialdone A. Schueler M. Kraemer D.C.A. Chotalia M. Xie S.Q. Barbieri M. de Santiago I. Lavitas L.-M. Branco M.R. et al.Complex multi-enhancer contacts captured by genome architecture mapping.Nature. 2017; 543: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), another proximity-ligation-independent method, SPRITE can be performed without requiring specialized equipment or training, is faster to perform, and does not require extensive whole genome amplification. Furthermore, because SPRITE does not rely on proximity ligation or whole-genome amplification, it can be extended beyond DNA to directly incorporate RNA simultaneously. We describe these specific features of SPRITE in the following sections. To test whether SPRITE can accurately map genome structure, we compared the results obtained by SPRITE to those measured by Hi-C. Specifically, we generated SPRITE maps in two mammalian cell types that have been previously mapped by Hi-C: mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3955) Google Scholar) and human lymphoblastoid cells (GM12878) (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S.P. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Omer A.D. Lander E.S. Aiden E.L. A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping.Cell. 2014; 159: 1665-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3598) Google Scholar). We generated ∼1.5 billion sequencing reads from each sample and matched reads containing the same barcode to obtain ∼50 million SPRITE clusters from each sample (STAR Methods). These SPRITE clusters range in size from two reads to > 1,000 reads per cluster (Figure S1C). To directly compare SPRITE and Hi-C, we converted SPRITE clusters into pairwise contact frequencies by enumerating all pairwise contacts observed within a single cluster and down-weighting each pairwise contact by the total number of molecules contained within the cluster (Figure 1A). This normalization prevents large SPRITE clusters from disproportionately impacting the pairwise frequency maps (STAR Methods). Overall, the pairwise contact maps generated with SPRITE are highly comparable to Hi-C maps, with similar structural features observed across all levels of genomic resolution. At a genome-wide level, we observe a clear preference for interactions that occur within the same chromosome (Figure 1B). At a chromosome-wide level, we observe similar A and B compartments as identified by Hi-C in both the mouse and the human data (Spearman ρ = 0.85, 0.93, respectively) (Figures S1D–S1F). These correspond to locations of active and inactive transcription (Gibcus and Dekker, 2013Gibcus J.H. Dekker J. The hierarchy of the 3D genome.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). At 40-kb resolution, we observe topologically associated domains (TADs), where adjacent DNA sites organize into highly self-interacting domains separated by boundaries that preclude interactions with other neighboring regions (Figure 1D). The location and strength of TAD boundaries, measured by insulation scores across the genome, are highly correlated in Hi-C and SPRITE for both mouse and human (Spearman ρ = 0.90, 0.94) (Figures S1G–S1I). Finally, at 25-kb resolution, we observe specific “looping” interactions that connect local regions that contain the expected convergent CTCF motif orientation previously described for loop structures (Figures 1E and S1J) (Sanborn et al., 2015Sanborn A.L. Rao S.S.P. Huang S.-C. Durand N.C. Huntley M.H. Jewett A.I. Bochkov I.D. Chinnappan D. Cutkosky A. Li J. et al.Chromatin extrusion explains key features of loop and domain formation in wild-type and engineered genomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E6456-E6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). More generally, we find that the loops previously identified by Hi-C are strongly enriched within our SPRITE data at 10-kb resolution (Figures S1K and S1L; STAR Methods). In addition to confirming pairwise genome structures identified by Hi-C, SPRITE can also directly measure multiple DNA regions that simultaneously interact within an individual cell, which we refer to as higher-order interactions. Although microscopy and specific proximity-ligation methods can also map higher-order interactions (Darrow et al., 2016Darrow E.M. Huntley M.H. Dudchenko O. Stamenova E.K. Durand N.C. Sun Z. Huang S.-C. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Shamim M. et al.Deletion of DXZ4 on the human inactive X chromosome alters higher-order genome architecture.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E4504-E4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, Olivares-Chauvet et al., 2016Olivares-Chauvet P. Mukamel Z. Lifshitz A. Schwartzman O. Elkayam N.O. Lubling Y. Deikus G. Sebra R.P. Tanay A. Capturing pairwise and multi-way chromosomal conformations using chromosomal walks.Nature. 2016; 540: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), these are largely restricted to mapping 3-way contacts. In contrast, SPRITE is not restricted in the number of simultaneous DNA contacts. To explore the higher-order structures identified by SPRITE, we enumerated all interactions that occur simultaneously between three or more independent genomic regions (k ≥ 3), which we refer to as a k-mer. Similar to pairwise contact frequencies, one of the largest determinants of k-mer frequency in our data is the linear genomic distance separating each region in the k-mer. To account for this, we computed an enrichment score by normalizing the frequency of the observed k-mer by the average frequency observed across random k-mers that retain the same genomic distance (Figure S2A; STAR Methods). Overall, we identified > 310,000 k-mers (1-Mb resolution, k = 3–14 regions) that were observed in at least five independent SPRITE clusters, occurred at a frequency that exceeded 90% of the random permutations, and occurred > 4-fold more frequently than the average of the permuted regions (Figure S2B; Table S1A; STAR Methods). Importantly, the frequency of observing even a single higher-order SPRITE cluster that does not represent a set of interactions that occur within the same individual cell is extremely low (< 0.2% of all clusters; Figure S1A). These enriched k-mers include various higher-order genomic DNA structures, including active compartments, gene clusters, and consecutive loop structures. We observed highly enriched k-mers that connect multiple A compartment (transcriptionally active) regions that are non-contiguous and span large distances of the same chromosome. Specifically, we observed tens of thousands of individual SPRITE clusters that contain reads from at least three different A compartment regions that span at least 100-Mb within an individual chromosome (Figures 2A and S2C; Tables S1B and S1C). This suggests that active DNA regions may interact within higher-order compartments (Figure 2B). We identified > 75 SPRITE clusters that connect three non-contiguous genomic regions within the human HIST1 clusters that encode 55 human histone genes (Figure 2C). Notably, these SPRITE clusters skip the intervening transcriptionally inactive regions. The frequency of SPRITE clusters that connect the three HIST1 gene clusters was never observed in any of the 100 randomly permuted k-mers containing the same genomic distance. This result suggests that multiple histone gene clusters simultaneously interact, consistent with observations that histone genes localize within specific nuclear bodies referred to as histone locus bodies (Nizami et al., 2010Nizami Z. Deryusheva S. Gall J.G. The Cajal body and histone locus body.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000653Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Figure 2D). Previous Hi-C studies suggested that consecutive loops may form higher-order interactions that bring together three distinct regions of the genome (Sanborn et al., 2015Sanborn A.L. Rao S.S.P. Huang S.-C. Durand N.C. Huntley M.H. Jewett A.I. Bochkov I.D. Chinnappan D. Cutkosky A. Li J. et al.Chromatin extrusion explains key features of loop and domain formation in wild-type and engineered genomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E6456-E6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we observe several examples of highly enriched k-mers that correspond to consecutive loop structures (Figure S2D). For example, we observe > 19 SPRITE clusters that contain reads corresponding to three loop anchor points on human chromosome 8 (Figure 2E). This suggests that multiple consecutive loops may occur simultaneously within the same cell (Figure 2F). In addition to these examples, we also observe > 11,000 enriched SPRITE k-mers corresponding to simultaneous 3-way interactions of TAD regions containing multiple enhancers and highly transcribed regions previously reported by GAM (Figure S2E; Tables S1D and S1E). Taken together, these results suggest that SPRITE can detect multiple DNA interactions that occur simultaneously. Because SPRITE does not rely on proximity ligation, which requires two DNA sites to be close enough to form a ligation junction (Dekker, 2016Dekker J. Mapping the 3D genome: Aiming for consilience.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 741-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Giorgetti and Heard, 2016Giorgetti L. Heard E. Closing the loop: 3C versus DNA FISH.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 215Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we reasoned that SPRITE might identify additional interactions that occur at further nuclear distances than those identified by Hi-C (Figure 3A). Indeed, we noticed that the number of pairwise contacts observed between two genomic regions as a function of their linear genomic distance (“distance decay”) occurs at different rates when comparing the Hi-C and SPRITE data (Figure S3A). Specifically, SPRITE identifies a significantly larger number of pairwise contacts that are present at larger linear genomic distances. Importantly, these additional long-range interactions correspond to an increased number of contacts between specific genomic regions expected to interact (Table S2A). For example, we observe a significant increase in interactions occurring between non-local active compartments separated by > 100 Mb (Figure S3B).Figure S3SPRITE Identifies Long-Range Intra-chromosomal Interactions and Hubs of Inter-chromosomal Interactions, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Relationship between contact frequency as a function of linear genomic distance observed in SPRITE (blue) and Hi-C (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

This stability is attributed to their organization within the effector protein Argonaute, which protects them from exonucleases that degrade naked single-stranded RNAs in the cell. Nonetheless, some miRNAs are destabilized, either constitutively or in response to neuronal excitation or growth factors (Avraham et al., 2010Avraham R. Sas-Chen A. Manor O. Steinfeld I. Shalgi R.

Artificial targets with extensive complementarity to the miRNA can trigger TDMD through a poorly understood process associated with tailing (addition of untemplated nucleotides) and trimming of the miRNA 3′ terminus (Ameres et al., 2010Ameres S.L.

Natural TDMD triggers are found in some herpesviruses, which use this mechanism to promote degradation of specific host miRNAs (Cazalla et al., 2010Cazalla D. Yario T. Steitz J.A.

In addition, a cellular transcript with TDMD activity limits miR-29b expression in cerebellar granule neurons and regulates behavior in mice and fish (Bitetti et al., 2018Bitetti A. Mallory A.C. Golini E. Carrieri C. Carreño Gutiérrez H. Perlas E. Pérez-Rico Y.A. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Enright A.J.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcribed and processed like mRNAs but do not code for functional proteins. Many lncRNAs have been annotated, but few have known functions (Kopp and Mendell, 2018Kopp F. Mendell J.T. Functional classification and experimental dissection of long noncoding RNAs.Cell. 2018; 172: 393-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). The lncRNA Cyrano is particularly intriguing because it is broadly conserved in vertebrates and contains a site with unusually high complementarity to the miR-7 miRNA (Ulitsky et al., 2011Ulitsky I. Shkumatava A. Jan C.H. Sive H. Bartel D.P. Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1537-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Another class of abundant yet enigmatic RNAs is the circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are formed through back-splicing of mRNA or lncRNA exons (Ebbesen et al., 2017Ebbesen K.K. Hansen T.B. Kjems J. Insights into circular RNA biology.RNA Biol. 2017; 14: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Among the most extensively characterized circRNAs is Cdr1as, which is conserved in mammals and dampens neuronal activity in mice (Hansen et al., 2013Hansen T.B. Jensen T.I. Clausen B.H. Bramsen J.B. Finsen B. Damgaard C.K. Kjems J. Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges.Nature. 2013; 495: 384-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (5176) Google Scholar, Memczak et al., 2013Memczak S.

Glažar P. Hernandez-Miranda L.R. Memczak S. Wolf S.A. Rybak-Wolf A. Filipchyk A. Klironomos F. Cerda Jara C.A. Fenske P. et al.Loss of a mammalian circular RNA locus causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function.Science. 2017; 357: eaam8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Cdr1as has many sites to miR-7 (130 and 73 sites in mouse and human Cdr1as, respectively), the same miRNA that pairs to Cyrano, and Cdr1as and Cyrano are the two RNAs that most frequently cross-link to miR-7 in human and mouse brain (Piwecka et al., 2017Piwecka M. Glažar P. Hernandez-Miranda L.R. Memczak S. Wolf S.A. Rybak-Wolf A. Filipchyk A. Klironomos F. Cerda Jara C.A. Fenske P. et al.Loss of a mammalian circular RNA locus causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function.Science. 2017; 357: eaam8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Cyrano promotes unusually efficient destruction of mature miR-7, which enables Cdr1as to accumulate in the brain. In zebrafish, Cyrano is expressed throughout the developing nervous system (Ulitsky et al., 2011Ulitsky I. Shkumatava A. Jan C.H. Sive H. Bartel D.P. Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1537-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). In the mouse embryo, Cyrano was also enriched in the early central and peripheral nervous systems (Figure S1A). In adult mice, Cyrano was broadly expressed with 5–10-fold higher expression in brain regions and muscle, a pattern largely conserved in human (Figures S1B and S1C). Within brain, Cyrano appeared more highly expressed in neurons than glia (Figures S1A and S1D), and within cells, Cyrano was mostly in cytoplasm (Figure S1E). To investigate the function of Cyrano in mammals, we generated Cyrano-deficient mice. The first half of exon 3, which includes the most conserved region of Cyrano, was targeted (Figures 1A and S1F). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) confirmed complete loss of the targeted region as well as a >90% decrease in flanking Cyrano RNA, presumably due to destabilization caused by removal of the final splice site (Figure 1A). Cyrano-deficient mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency and had no overt abnormalities (Table S1). Cyrano–/– adult mice had similar weights and 1-year survival compared to sex-matched littermate controls, and Cyrano loss did not seem to affect performance in standard neurobehavioral tests (data not shown). In contrast, Cyrano knockdown in zebrafish appears to cause a neurodevelopmental phenotype (Ulitsky et al., 2011Ulitsky I. Shkumatava A. Jan C.H. Sive H. Bartel D.P. Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1537-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), a difference that might be due to the different experimental approaches used to query Cyrano loss of function, as reported for other genes (Kok et al., 2015Kok F.O. Shin M. Ni C.W. Gupta A. Grosse A.S. van Impel A. Kirchmaier B.C. Peterson-Maduro J. Kourkoulis G. Male I. et al.Reverse genetic screening reveals poor correlation between morpholino-induced and mutant phenotypes in zebrafish.Dev. Cell. 2015; 32: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Despite their seemingly normal appearance, Cyrano–/– mice had striking molecular phenotypes. The most conserved region of Cyrano contains an unusual site for miR-7 (Figure 1A). In addition to pairing to the miRNA extended seed region (nucleotides 2–8), a common feature of effective miRNA sites (Bartel, 2018Bartel D.P. Metazoan MicroRNAs.Cell. 2018; 173: 20-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), this site has extensive pairing to the remainder of the miRNA (Ulitsky et al., 2011Ulitsky I. Shkumatava A. Jan C.H. Sive H. Bartel D.P. Conserved function of lincRNAs in vertebrate embryonic development despite rapid sequence evolution.Cell. 2011; 147: 1537-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar), with only a short internal loop that disrupts pairing to miRNA nucleotides 9 and 10 and should prevent Argonaute2-catalyzed slicing of Cyrano (Elbashir et al., 2001Elbashir S.M. Martinez J. Patkaniowska A. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Functional anatomy of siRNAs for mediating efficient RNAi in Drosophila melanogaster embryo lysate.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-6888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). To determine whether Cyrano deficiency affected accumulation of miR-7 or other miRNAs, we sequenced small RNAs from both wild-type and Cyrano–/– brain samples. In humans, all three MIR7 loci express identical miRNAs, whereas in mice, the three loci express two variants, miR-7a and miR-7b, which differ by a single nucleotide (A or U, respectively) at position 10. In Cyrano–/– mice, miR-7a and miR-7b increased 40- and 47-fold in cerebellum and 6- and 7-fold in hippocampus (Figures 1B and 1C). Only two other miRNAs, miR-671 and miR-409-3p, were differentially expressed in both tissues, changing 1.4–2.8-fold. In principle, increased miR-7 could be caused by (1) increased transcription of Mir7 genes, (2) enhanced processing of primary or precursor miR-7 RNAs, and/or (3) decreased miR-7 degradation. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined levels of intermediates in the miRNA-processing pathway. No changes were observed in either primary or precursor miR-7 RNAs in Cyrano–/– mice (Figures S2A and S2B). Most importantly, whereas possibilities 1 and 2 would each generate more miRNA duplex (a biogenesis intermediate in which the miRNA is paired to its passenger strand), our small-RNA sequencing results revealed no increase in miR-7 passenger strands (Figures 1B and 1C, species with 3p suffixes), which implied that Cyrano promotes degradation of mature miR-7 after it is loaded into Argonaute. To further characterize the effect of Cyrano loss on miR-7 levels, we performed northern-blot analyses of samples from 12 adult tissues spanning the range of Cyrano expression (Figure 1D). In Cyrano–/– pituitary and pancreatic islets, two tissues with relatively low expression of Cyrano and the highest baseline levels of miR-7, the miR-7 fold changes were not statistically significant. However, in all other Cyrano-deficient tissues tested, miR-7 levels significantly increased, with magnitudes ranging from 3- to 52-fold and increases most prominent in brain tissues. Overall, miR-7 fold changes correlated with Cyrano expression (Figure S2C), as expected if Cyrano exerts greater effects in tissues in which it is more highly expressed. Increased levels of miR-7 were reliably observed in Cyrano–/– embryos as early as E13.5 (Figure S2D) and were also observed in primary cultures of Cyrano–/– neurons, where they increased 16–45-fold (Figure S2E). To test whether regulation of miR-7 was conserved in humans, we used CRISPRi (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar) to inhibit CYRANO transcription in human cells. CYRANO reduction in K562 cells led to a specific increase in miR-7, with no significant change in miR-7-3p (Figure 1E). Similar results were also observed in additional human and mouse cell lines, with the increase in miR-7 correlating with the degree of CYRANO knockdown (Figure S2F). These findings confirmed that the ability of Cyrano to destabilize miR-7 is conserved in humans and requires transcription of the CYRANO locus. Based on previous studies of TDMD triggered by artificial and viral transcripts, we suspected that the miR-7 site within Cyrano was crucial for the ability of this endogenous transcript to direct miRNA degradation. To test this, we used Cas9 to generate six mouse lines (M1–M6) with perturbations in the site (Figure 2A). Although some of the mutations were expected to disrupt miR-7 binding (Bartel, 2018Bartel D.P. Metazoan MicroRNAs.Cell. 2018; 173: 20-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar), none affected expression of Cyrano in the tissues tested (cerebellum and pituitary) (Figure S3). In contrast, all six disrupted the ability of Cyrano to induce miR-7 degradation (Figure 2B). The M2 and M3 mutations only perturbed miR-7 seed pairing, and mice harboring these mutations had miR-7 increases resembling those of Cyrano-deficient mice, indicating that, as expected, seed pairing is critical for this interaction. More surprisingly, the M1 allele, which had the smallest perturbation, a 2 nt deletion eliminating only a single Watson–Crick pair to the extended seed region and reducing the size of the internal loop from 4 to 3 nucleotides, was also largely unable to promote miR-7 destruction. Overall, the effects of perturbing the miR-7 site demonstrated that Cyrano acts through a form of TDMD reminiscent of that initially observed for artificial and viral transcripts.Figure S3Mutating the miR-7 Site in Cyrano Does Not Cause Detectable Changes in Cyrano Levels, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Cyrano locus annotated with binding sites of 3 RT-qPCR primer pairs (#1, #2, #3).

(C) Cyrano expression in wild-type and Cyrano mutant pituitary. Otherwise, this panel is as in (B). One important difference between TDMD mediated by Cyrano and that described previously was its efficacy, as indicated by the decrease in miR-7 molecules per Cyrano molecule observed at steady state. In wild-type cerebellar granule neuron (CGN) cultures, Cyrano was present at 102 ± 16 molecules per cell, and miR-7 was present at 40 ± 7 molecules per cell, whereas in Cyrano-deficient CGNs, miR-7 levels increased 45-fold to 1,800 molecules per cell (Figure S2E; Table S2). These values implied that Cyrano promoted TDMD with multiple turnover, with each Cyrano molecule responsible for destruction of an average of 17 miR-7 molecules ((1,800 – 40) ÷ 102), especially when considering that the insensitivity of Cyrano to perturbation of either miR-7 pairing (Figure S3) or miR-7 abundance (described later) disfavored a model in which Cyrano degradation was coupled to miR-7 degradation. In contrast, similar calculations using values reported for previous examples of TDMD estimated the efficacy of viral HSUR1 to be ∼0.1 miR-27 molecules per target (Cazalla et al., 2010Cazalla D.

McGeary S.E. Title A.C. Agarwal V. Bartel D.P. Stoffel M. Impact of microRNA levels, target-site complementarity, and cooperativity on competing endogenous RNA-regulated gene expression.Mol. Cell. 2016; 64: 565-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) or 0.3–1.0 miRNA molecules per target, with multiple turnover achieved only when artificially boosting the miRNA level (de la Mata et al., 2015de la Mata M. Gaidatzis D. Vitanescu M. Stadler M.B. Wentzel C. Scheiffele P. Filipowicz W. Großhans H. Potent degradation of neuronal miRNAs induced by highly complementary targets.EMBO Rep. 2015; 16: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These estimates indicated that Cyrano-promoted TDMD is 17–170 times more effective than that of previously described examples. To investigate further the specificity of this phenomenon, we examined whether the miR-7–destabilizing activity of Cyrano could be applied to other miRNAs. The 3′ UTR of a reporter gene was modified to include a 197 nt fragment of Cyrano, using versions of this region that contained either a wild-type miR-7 site, a mutant miR-7 site, or a site extensively complementary to either miR-16 or miR-17 (Figure 2C). Decreased miR-7 was observed only in cells expressing the wild-type Cyrano region, whereas decreased miR-16 or miR-17 was observed specifically in cells expressing the region with cognate sites (Figure 2D). These results resembled those of analogous experiments that start with viral or artificial TDMD-triggering transcripts, and like those previous experiments, the amount of degradation was modest, with only ∼3-fold reductions of the cognate miRNA observed for our constructs in HEK293T cells—much less than the 45-fold reduction observed for endogenous Cyrano in CGN culture (Figure S2E). Tailing and trimming of the miRNA 3′ end are often associated with TDMD (Ameres et al., 2010Ameres S.L. Horwich M.D. Hung J.H. Xu J. Ghildiyal M. Weng Z. Zamore P.D.

Likewise, we found that the fractions of tailed (≥25 nt) and trimmed (≤22 nt) miR-7 molecules were greater in wild-type than in Cyrano–/– hippocampus and cerebellum (Figures 3A and S4A). Such differences were not observed for any other miRNA with read coverage sufficient for analysis (Figures S4B and S4C), as exemplified by results for miR-92b (Figures 3A and S4A).Figure S4Cyrano Induces Tailing and Trimming of miR-7, but Tailing Appears Dispensable, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Influence of Cyrano on miR-7 tailing and trimming in cerebellum.

Small intestine ILC2s constitutively express the IL-25 receptor, which is negatively regulated by A20 (Tnfaip3). A20 deficiency in ILC2s spontaneously triggers the circuit and, unexpectedly, promotes adaptive small-intestinal lengthening and remodeling. Circuit activation occurs upon weaning and is enabled by dietary polysaccharides that render mice permissive for Tritrichomonas colonization, resulting in luminal accumulation of acetate and succinate, metabolites of the protist hydrogenosome. Tuft cells express GPR91, the succinate receptor, and dietary succinate, but not acetate, activates ILC2s via a tuft-, TRPM5-, and IL-25-dependent pathway. Also induced by parasitic helminths, circuit activation and small intestinal remodeling impairs infestation by new helminths, consistent with the phenomenon of concomitant immunity. We describe a metabolic sensing circuit that may have evolved to facilitate mutualistic responses to luminal pathosymbionts."
https://openalex.org/W2806524706,"Visualization of the transcriptome and the nuclear organization in situ has been challenging for single-cell analysis. Here, we demonstrate a multiplexed single-molecule in situ method, intron seqFISH, that allows imaging of 10,421 genes at their nascent transcription active sites in single cells, followed by mRNA and lncRNA seqFISH and immunofluorescence. This nascent transcriptome-profiling method can identify different cell types and states with mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts. The nascent sites of RNA synthesis tend to be localized on the surfaces of chromosome territories, and their organization in individual cells is highly variable. Surprisingly, the global nascent transcription oscillated asynchronously in individual cells with a period of 2 hr in mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as in fibroblasts. Together, spatial genomics of the nascent transcriptome by intron seqFISH reveals nuclear organizational principles and fast dynamics in single cells that are otherwise obscured."
https://openalex.org/W2807624799,"Rapid, efficient generation of knock-in mice with targeted large insertions remains a major hurdle in mouse genetics. Here, we describe two-cell homologous recombination (2C-HR)-CRISPR, a highly efficient gene-editing method based on introducing CRISPR reagents into embryos at the two-cell stage, which takes advantage of the open chromatin structure and the likely increase in homologous-recombination efficiency during the long G2 phase. Combining 2C-HR-CRISPR with a modified biotin-streptavidin approach to localize repair templates to target sites, we achieved a more-than-tenfold increase (up to 95%) in knock-in efficiency over standard methods. We targeted 20 endogenous genes expressed in blastocysts with fluorescent reporters and generated reporter mouse lines. We also generated triple-color blastocysts with all three lineages differentially labeled, as well as embryos carrying the two-component auxin-inducible degradation system for probing protein function. We suggest that 2C-HR-CRISPR is superior to random transgenesis or standard genome-editing protocols, because it ensures highly efficient insertions at endogenous loci and defined 'safe harbor' sites."

While recent experimental advances enable large-scale and long-term neural recordings with high temporal fidelity, it remains a formidable challenge to extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how rapid single-trial circuit dynamics change slowly over many trials to mediate learning. We demonstrate a simple tensor component analysis (TCA) can meet this challenge by extracting three interconnected, low-dimensional descriptions of neural data: neuron factors, reflecting cell assemblies; temporal factors, reflecting rapid circuit dynamics mediating perceptions, thoughts, and actions within each trial; and trial factors, describing both long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from artificial neural networks, large-scale calcium imaging of rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation, and multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during brain machine interface learning."
https://openalex.org/W2807022503,"Paneth cells are post-mitotic intestinal epithelial cells supporting the stem cell niche and mucosal immunity. Paneth cell pathologies are observed in various gastrointestinal diseases, but their plasticity and response to genomic and environmental challenges remain unclear. Using a knockin allele engineered at the mouse Lyz1 locus, we performed detailed Paneth cell-lineage tracing. Irradiation induced a subset of Paneth cells to proliferate and differentiate into villus epithelial cells. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that Paneth cells sorted from irradiated mice acquired a stem cell-like transcriptome; when cultured in vitro, these individual Paneth cells formed organoids. Irradiation activated Notch signaling, and forced expression of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in Paneth cells, but not Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, induced their dedifferentiation. This study documents Paneth cell plasticity, particularly their ability to participate in epithelial replenishment following stem cell loss, adding to a growing body of knowledge detailing the molecular pathways controlling injury-induced regeneration."

Although automated cell-culture systems such as bioreactors offer strict control over liquid culture conditions, they often do not scale to high-throughput or require cumbersome redesign to alter growth conditions. We report the design and validation of eVOLVER, a scalable do-it-yourself (DIY) framework, which can be configured to carry out high-throughput growth experiments in molecular evolution, systems biology, and microbiology. High-throughput evolution of yeast populations grown at different densities reveals that eVOLVER can be applied to characterize adaptive niches. Growth selection on a genome-wide yeast knockout library, using temperatures varied over different timescales, finds strains sensitive to temperature changes or frequency of temperature change. Inspired by large-scale integration of electronics and microfluidics, we also demonstrate millifluidic multiplexing modules that enable multiplexed media routing, cleaning, vial-to-vial transfers and automated yeast mating."

In this regard, coronaviruses have evolved a complicated receptor-recognition system through their spike proteins. Spikes from highly related coronaviruses can recognize distinct receptors, whereas spikes of distant coronaviruses can employ the same cell-surface molecule for entry. Moreover, coronavirus spikes can recognize a broad range of cell-surface molecules in addition to the receptors and thereby can augment coronavirus attachment or entry. The receptor of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). In this study, we identified membrane-associated 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) as an additional binding target of the MERS-CoV spike. Further analyses indicated that GRP78 could not independently render nonpermissive cells susceptible to MERS-CoV infection but could facilitate MERS-CoV entry into permissive cells by augmenting virus attachment. More importantly, by exploring potential interactions between GRP78 and spikes of other coronaviruses, we discovered that the highly conserved human GRP78 could interact with the spike protein of bat coronavirus HKU9 (bCoV-HKU9) and facilitate its attachment to the host cell surface. Taken together, our study has identified GRP78 as a host factor that can interact with the spike proteins of two Betacoronaviruses, the lineage C MERS-CoV and the lineage D bCoV-HKU9. The capacity of GRP78 to facilitate surface attachment of both a human coronavirus and a phylogenetically related bat coronavirus exemplifies the need for continuous surveillance of the evolution of animal coronaviruses to monitor their potential for human adaptations.

Understanding the principles of tissue-Treg biology is a prerequisite for precision-targeting strategies. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, in particular the Foxp3+CD4+ subset, are critical elements of an organism’s defense against pathogens, responsible for reining in an over-exuberant immune response. In lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), Treg cells usually constitute 10%–20% of the CD4+ T cell compartment. Until recently, our vision of Treg biology was heavily colored by information derived from this circulating pool and its response to an infectious or inflammatory insult. However, it has become increasingly clear that Treg cells can also accumulate in a variety of nonlymphoid tissues, where they exert both anti-inflammatory and homeostatic functions (Panduro et al., 2016Panduro M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Tissue Tregs.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34: 609-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A paradigmatic “tissue-Treg” population is that found in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of male mice (Feuerer et al., 2009Feuerer M. Herrero L. Cipolletta D. Naaz A. Wong J. Nayer A. Lee J. Goldfine A.B. Benoist C. Shoelson S. Mathis D. Lean, but not obese, fat is enriched for a unique population of regulatory T cells that affect metabolic parameters.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 930-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar). VAT-Treg cells, which increase with age to as high as 60%–80% of the local CD4+ T cell compartment, have a transcriptome distinct from those of lymphoid-organ and other nonlymphoid-tissue Treg populations (Feuerer et al., 2009Feuerer M.

Feuerer M. Li A. Kamei N. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. Benoist C. Mathis D. PPAR-γ is a major driver of the accumulation and phenotype of adipose tissue Treg cells.Nature. 2012; 486: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), the “master-regulator” of adipocyte differentiation. VAT-Treg cells display a clonally expanded repertoire of antigen-specific receptors (T cell receptors [TCRs]) (Feuerer et al., 2009Feuerer M. Herrero L. Cipolletta D. Naaz A. Wong J. Nayer A. Lee J.

According to several lines of evidence, these cells regulate local and systemic metabolic indices through a combined effect on both immunocytes and adipocytes (Feuerer et al., 2009Feuerer M.

Immunol. 2015; 16: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). While these studies (and others) concurred in attributing insulin-sensitizing effects to VAT Tregs in 25- to 35-week-old mice on lean chow, a recent study reported an opposing influence in old mice aged 55–110 weeks (Bapat et al., 2015Bapat S.P. Myoung Suh J. Fang S. Liu S. Zhang Y. Cheng A. Zhou C. Liang Y. LeBlanc M. Liddle C. et al.Depletion of fat-resident Treg cells prevents age-associated insulin resistance.Nature. 2015; 528: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Progress has been made in elucidating the provenance, dependencies, and activities of VAT-Treg cells (Panduro et al., 2016Panduro M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Tissue Tregs.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 34: 609-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), but a major stumbling block has been their rarity (∼5,000/mouse), exacerbated by an inopportune localization (within fat, classically toxic to T cells during isolation and culture). Hence, certain critical issues have remained unresolved, notably: what molecular and cellular factors drive VAT-Treg accumulation, and when, where, and how is the unique VAT-Treg phenotype established? To address these questions, we side-stepped the aforementioned experimental difficulties by engineering a transgenic (tg) mouse line carrying the pre-rearranged Tcra and Tcrb genes of an expanded VAT-Treg clone. These mice hosted an exaggerated population of VAT Tregs, the great majority of which expressed the transgene-encoded TCR chains, and had a substantially improved metabolic tenor. This model permitted us to definitively establish a role for TCR specificity, uncover an unexpected function for Foxp3, and evidenced a cell-intrinsic role for the interleukin(IL)-33 receptor in VAT-Treg accumulation in adipose tissue. We also demonstrated that the definitive VAT-Treg phenotype emerged only in cells within adipose tissue, via a two-stage, two-site process. A VAT-Treg TCR-tg mouse line should afford several advantages: more VAT Tregs, a more homogeneous population, and identifiable precursors potentially accessible in the lymphoid organs. We previously identified multiple clones in the epididymal VAT-Treg population of 25- to 30-week-old C57BL/6J (B6) mice (Kolodin et al., 2015Kolodin D. van Panhuys N. Li C. Magnuson A.M. Cipolletta D. Miller C.M. Wagers A. Germain R.N. Benoist C. Mathis D. Antigen- and cytokine-driven accumulation of regulatory T cells in visceral adipose tissue of lean mice.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 543-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Our primary criteria in choosing one of them for the generation of a TCR-tg line were the extent of its expansion and the availability of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for each of its TCR chains. Clone 53, which constituted 10% of the VAT-Treg population in one of the mice, expressed a TCR comprised of chains carrying the Vα2 and Vβ4 variable regions, for which mAbs are commercially available. Genomic DNA constructs encoding each of the chains were co-injected into B6 mouse embryos, and a VAT-Treg TCR-tg line (vTreg53) expressing both chains was derived and expanded. In 20-week-old male Tg+ mice, both the frequency and number of total Tregs in VAT, but not in the spleen, were significantly elevated compared with corresponding values for Tg− littermates (Figure 1A). Within the TCR-tg mice, there was a strong enrichment for clonotype+ Treg, but not Tconv, cells in VAT (vis-à-vis the spleen) (Figure 1B). This augmentation was not seen for Tregs in most other nonlymphoid tissues (colon, lung, liver) of Tg+ mice; a slight increase in the fraction (although not number) for muscle Tregs most likely reflects fat marbling within that tissue (Figure S1A). Of the various adipose depots, epididymal VAT hosted the greatest concentration of total and clonotype+ Treg cells, more so than ovarian VAT or peri-renal and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from either sex (Figure 1C). Already at 5 weeks, clonotype+ Tregs were enriched in VAT of male Tg+ mice, a differential that increased with age (Figure S1B, upper). In contrast, there were minimal age-related changes in the contribution of clonotype+ Tconv cells in VAT or spleen (Figure S1B, lower). VAT Treg cells arise in the thymus during the first weeks of life (Kolodin et al., 2015Kolodin D. van Panhuys N. Li C. Magnuson A.M. Cipolletta D. Miller C.M. Wagers A. Germain R.N. Benoist C.

Similar conclusions came from studying vTreg53 TCR-tg mice of Rag−/− genotype in order to avoid secondary rearrangements at the endogenous Tcrα and/or Tcrb loci (Figures S1D and S1E). Treg frequencies in VAT and SAT were similar, but the density was much higher in the former case. A major driver of the VAT-Treg phenotype is PPARγ (Cipolletta et al., 2012Cipolletta D. Feuerer M. Li A. Kamei N. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. Benoist C. Mathis D. PPAR-γ is a major driver of the accumulation and phenotype of adipose tissue Treg cells.Nature. 2012; 486: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no existing anti-PPARγ mAb is suitable for histologic or flow-cytometric analyses. Therefore, we generated a PPARγ-reporter mouse line by introducing an IRES-Tdtomato (Tdt) cassette at the beginning of the 3′ UTR of the Pparg locus. The resulting allele reports expression of both the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 isoforms (Figure S2A). We crossed Pparg-Tdt and Foxp3-GFP reporter alleles into the vTreg53 TCR-tg line to allow us to follow the emergence and accumulation of true VAT-Treg cells. In clear contrast to the spleen, the vast majority (∼80%) of Tregs in VAT from 20-week-old non-tg mice expressed the PPARγ reporter (Figure 1D). This value rose even higher (to ∼98%) in clonotype+ VAT Tregs from TCR-tg littermates, while it sank (to ∼35%) in corresponding clonotype− cells. Similar results were obtained using mAbs to quantify expression of three additional proteins reported to preferentially mark VAT Tregs: ST2, KLRG1, and GATA3 (Feuerer et al., 2009Feuerer M.

Some PPARγ+ Treg cells were found in muscle and the liver, but levels remained well below those in VAT (Figure S2C). For a global perspective, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare the gene-expression profiles of clonotypehi splenic and VAT Tregs from 20-week-old Tg+ Foxp3-GFP reporter mice. The previously defined VAT-Treg up-signature (Cipolletta et al., 2015Cipolletta D. Cohen P. Spiegelman B.M. Benoist C. Mathis D. Appearance and disappearance of the mRNA signature characteristic of Treg cells in visceral adipose tissue: age, diet, and PPARγ effects.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was highly over-represented in TCR-tg VAT Tregs, whereas the down-signature was strongly under-represented (Figure 1E). VAT-Treg cells improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic indicators through effects on local adipocytes and immunocytes, particularly macrophages (MFs) (Feuerer et al., 2009Feuerer M. Herrero L. Cipolletta D. Naaz A. Wong J. Nayer A. Lee J. Goldfine A.B. Benoist C. Shoelson S. Mathis D.

Immunol. 2015; 16: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Corresponding to elevated frequencies and numbers of VAT Tregs in TCR-tg versus non-tg littermates at 14–16 weeks of age (Figure S2D), the frequencies and numbers of VAT CD11chiCD11bhi inflammatory MFs were significantly reduced (Figures 1F and S2E), as was expression of most of a panel of inflammatory gene markers (Figure S2F). The body and VAT weights of Tg+ and Tg− littermates were comparable (Figure S2G). Nonetheless, the Tg+ mice showed significantly improved insulin sensitivity (Figure 1G), glucose tolerance (Figure 1H), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values (Figure S2H). In brief, we were successful at generating a VAT-Treg TCR-tg mouse line with an enriched Treg population specifically in epididymal adipose tissue, dominated by bona fide VAT Tregs displaying the transgene-encoded Vα2+Vβ4+ TCR specificity. vTreg53 TCR-tg mice showed substantially improved inflammatory and metabolic indices. The specific enrichment of Treg cells in VAT of male vTreg53 TCR-tg mice, including those on a Rag−/− background, argued that the TCR specificity had an important influence on VAT-Treg accumulation. In support of this notion, a higher fraction of clonotype+ than clonotype− Treg cells in the TCR-tg mice were cycling, as estimated from Ki67 staining (Figure 2A); and clonotype+ Treg cells had a longer half-life, assessed from bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) long-term-incorporation followed by chase experiments (Figure 2B). To address this issue in a more definitive manner, we turned to adoptive-transfer approaches. Administration of total CD4+ T cells from pooled spleen and LNs of male CD45.2+ Tg− mice into male B6.CD45.1+ recipients resulted in insignificant accumulation of the polyclonal donor Tregs in spleen, VAT, or SAT 12 weeks later (Figure 2C). In contrast, contemporaneous transfer of CD4+ T cells from Tg+ littermates engendered a robust donor Treg population in VAT, although not in spleen or SAT (Figure 2C). There was a strong enrichment of clonotype+ Tregs in the donor-derived VAT (compared with spleen) population; the few TCR-tg Treg cells recovered in SAT were also enriched for those displaying high levels of Vα2+Vβ4+ TCRs (Figure 2D). Tg+ donor Treg cells accumulated in VAT progressively over time, beginning at ∼4 weeks after administration (Figure 2E). Transfer of Foxp3+CD4+ Treg cells isolated from TCR-tg donors recapitulated the effect of administering total CD4+ T cells (Figure 2F). These findings definitively established that the TCR specificity was a critical driver of Treg accumulation in VAT: Treg cells displaying the vTreg53 specificity were much more “VATophilic” than were polyclonal Tregs. Although Foxp3−CD4+ Tconv cells in the TCR-tg mice expressed the vTreg53 TCR specificity, they did not accumulate in VAT like Foxp3+CD4+ Treg cells did (Figures 1A and 1B). Moreover, only a small fraction of the few Tconv cells recovered from VAT expressed PPARγ and ST2 (Figure 2G), factors that promote specific accumulation of Tregs at that site (Cipolletta et al., 2012Cipolletta D. Feuerer M. Li A. Kamei N. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. Benoist C. Mathis D.

TCR-tg Tconv cells were also not enriched in VAT 12 weeks after transfer of CD4+ T cells from pooled lymphoid organs of male CD45.2+ Tg+ mice into male B6.CD45.1+ recipients (Figure 2H). The lack of VAT accumulation was not a matter of timing: the representation of transferred TCR-tg Tconv cells in the spleen peaked a few days after their administration and then crashed, while they occurred at low levels for at least 12 weeks in VAT and SAT (Figure 2I). Introduction of Tconv cells sorted from pooled lymphoid organs of TCR-tg mice also failed to engender a robust VAT-Tconv population 12 weeks later (Figure 2J); nor did the transferred cells convert to VAT Tregs (Figure 2K). Foxp3 is the most important transcription factor (TF) distinguishing Treg and Tconv cells, although it actually accounts for less than half of the classical Treg signature (Hill et al., 2007Hill J.A. Feuerer M. Tash K. Haxhinasto S. Perez J. Melamed R. Mathis D. Benoist C. Foxp3 transcription-factor-dependent and -independent regulation of the regulatory T cell transcriptional signature.Immunity. 2007; 27: 786-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To determine whether Foxp3 might somehow arm Tconv cells for accumulation in VAT, we retrovirally transduced an empty expression vector or one carrying a Foxp3 cDNA into Tconv cells from pooled lymphoid organs of CD45.2+ Tg+ donors and transferred them into B6.CD45.1+ recipients. 8 weeks later, there was a preferential accumulation of Foxp3-transduced but not control-transduced cells in VAT though not in the spleen (Figure 3A). The kinetics of enrichment were very similar to those observed for Treg accumulation after transfer of total CD4+ T cells from TCR-tg mice (compare Figures 2E and 3B). To explore what functions might be endowed by expression of Foxp3 in ex vivo Tconv cells, we sorted Foxp3-transduced and control-transduced Vα2hiVβ4hi CD4+ T cells recovered from the spleen of recipient mice 1 week after transfer and performed RNA-seq analysis. As anticipated (Hill et al., 2007Hill J.A. Feuerer M. Tash K. Haxhinasto S. Perez J. Melamed R. Mathis D. Benoist C. Foxp3 transcription-factor-dependent and -independent regulation of the regulatory T cell transcriptional signature.Immunity. 2007; 27: 786-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), a fold-change/fold-change plot revealed that only a subset of the loci upregulated at least 2-fold in Tg+ splenic Treg versus Tconv cells (genes on the right side of the plot) was also upregulated by Foxp3 expression in ex vivo Tconv cells (genes in the upper-right section of the plot) (Figure 3C). Interestingly, once the Foxp3-transduced Tconv cells were installed in VAT (6 weeks post-transfer), they had upregulated essentially the entire VAT Treg signature (Figure 3D). To address the relevance of differential cycling-gene transcription (Figure 3C), we stained T cell populations from 10-week-old TCR-tg mice with the cell-cycle marker, Ki67. Clonotype+ Treg cells cycled more actively in VAT than in spleen or SAT (Figure 3E). At all three of these sites, clonotype+ Tconv cells were in cycle significantly less frequently than were their clonotype+ Treg counterparts. Notably, Foxp3-transduced Tconv cells near-universally expressed PPARγ and ST2 within VAT (Figures 3F and 3G). Because these two factors promote Treg accumulation specifically in VAT, we asked whether transduction of either one of them alone could replace Foxp3. This proved not to be the case (Figure 3H). Thus, quite unexpectedly, Foxp3 is also essential for T cell enrichment in VAT, upstream of PPARγ and ST2. Two groups have argued that IL-33 has a substantial and direct influence on VAT Treg accumulation (Vasanthakumar et al., 2015Vasanthakumar A. Moro K. Xin A. Liao Y. Gloury R. Kawamoto S. Fagarasan S. Mielke L.A. Afshar-Sterle S. Masters S.L. et al.The transcriptional regulators IRF4, BATF and IL-33 orchestrate development and maintenance of adipose tissue-resident regulatory T cells.Nat.

Mathis D. Antigen- and cytokine-driven accumulation of regulatory T cells in visceral adipose tissue of lean mice.Cell Metab. 2015; 21: 543-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar); however, another group maintained that any influence of IL-33 on VAT Treg cells was primarily indirect, operating via an innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-2 intermediate (Molofsky et al., 2015Molofsky A.B. Van Gool F. Liang H.E. Van Dyken S.J. Nussbaum J.C. Lee J. Bluestone J.A. Locksley R.M. Interleukin-33 and interferon-γ counter-regulate group 2 innate lymphoid cell activation during immune perturbation.Immunity. 2015; 43: 161-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). None of these studies examined mice with a Treg-specific ablation of the IL-33 receptor, ST2 (encoded by Il1rl1), and all were confounded by potential replacement of bona fide VAT Treg cells with lymphoid-organ Tregs circulating through and pausing within an empty VAT compartment. Therefore, we generated vTreg53 TCR-tg mice with a homozygous Il1rl1 null mutation specifically in Treg cells. There was a clear, although not complete, loss of clonotype+ VAT Tregs in the mutant TCR-tg mice; and the few clonotype+ SAT Tregs were reduced to even lower levels (Figure 4A). No significant loss of Tregs was detected in the spleen of the same mice (Figure 4A). Nor was there a change in the representation of VAT ILC-2 s (Figure S3A). Loss of ST2 in Treg cells from non-tg littermates also resulted in a significant reduction in VAT Tregs (Figure S3B).Figure S3ILCs in the Absence of ST2 on Treg Cells and Treg Cells in Tg− Il1rl1f/f Foxp3-Cre Mice, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Frequencies and numbers of VAT ILC2s from 10wk-old Tg+ Il1rl1+/+ or Tg+ Il1rl1f/f Foxp3-Cre male mice (n = 4).(B) Frequencies of KLRG1+ Treg cells from VAT of 36wk-old Tg- Il1rl1+/+Foxp3-Cre and Il1rl1f/f Foxp3-Cre male littermates (n ≥ 6).Numbers refer to the fraction of cells in the indicated gate.

Abbreviations as per Figure 1. All summary plots show mean ± SD. We asked whether the relative dearth of Treg cells in SAT vis-à-vis VAT might reflect a reduction in the level of this cytokine alarmin. Quantification of Il33 transcripts in whole adipose tissue (Figure 4B), the percentage of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells expressing IL-33 (Figure 4C), and the number of IL-33+ mesenchymal stromal cells (Figure 4D) in 8- to 10-week-old mice all pointed to reduced IL-33 expression in SAT. In concert with this finding, as well as past observations of a feed-back loop (Schiering et al., 2014Schiering C. Krausgruber T. Chomka A. Fröhlich A. Adelmann K. Wohlfert E.A. Pott J. Griseri T. Bollrath J. Hegazy A.N. et al.The alarmin IL-33 promotes regulatory T-cell function in the intestine.Nature. 2014; 513: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), SAT Treg cells displayed levels of the IL-33 receptor lower than those of VAT Tregs (Figure 4E). In brief, we can now state without equivocation that accumulation of Treg cells in epididymal VAT depends to a substantial degree on a direct effect of IL-33. This finding does not rule out an additional, indirect, effect of IL-33-responding ILC2s on Tregs. When, where, and how the definitive phenotype of VAT-Treg cells is acquired are important questions that have been difficult to answer, first, because of the heterogeneity of the Foxp3+CD4+ population in VAT, hosting both true VAT Tregs and circulating Tregs that display a diversity of TCR specificities (Cipolletta et al., 2015Cipolletta D.

The universal conservation of NusG/RfaH/Spt5 suggests that the molecular mechanisms uncovered here are widespread. Multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs) interact with a wide array of accessory proteins that modulate every step of RNA synthesis.

Bacterial NusG is a two-domain monomer. Spt5 forms a heterodimer with Spt4 in archaea and eukaryotes (Werner, 2012Werner F.

The NusG N-terminal domain (NGN), present in all NusG/Spt5-family proteins, contacts RNAP and is followed by a single KOW (Mooney et al., 2009bMooney R.A. Schweimer K. Rösch P. Gottesman M.

The KOWs serve as contact sites for interacting proteins, and the Spt5 KOWs also contact RNA or DNA (Bernecky et al., 2017Bernecky C. Plitzko J.M. Cramer P.

Fu J. Reese J.C. Biochemical analysis of yeast suppressor of Ty 4/5 (Spt4/5) reveals the importance of nucleic acid interactions in the prevention of RNA polymerase II arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 9853-9870Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Life’s only universal transcription factor plays a central role in pausing, underscoring the importance of pausing in gene regulation. Pausing is proposed to aid timely recruitment of transcription regulators, guide nascent RNA folding, oppose chromatin silencing and genome instability, permit termination, and match the rate of transcription to those of other coupled processes, such as translation and splicing (Mayer et al., 2017Mayer A. Landry H.M. Churchman L.S. Pause & go: from the discovery of RNA polymerase pausing to its functional implications.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2017; 46: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, excessive pausing may lead to arrest, particularly in protein-coated DNA such as eukaryotic chromatin. Indeed, yeast Spt5 assists RNAP progression through the nucleosome (Crickard et al., 2017Crickard J.B. Lee J. Lee T.-H. Reese J.C. The elongation factor Spt4/5 regulates RNA polymerase II transcription through the nucleosome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 6362-6374Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although recent results have suggested biophysical mechanisms for pausing via uncoupling of RNA and DNA translocation and for pause stabilization via rotation of an RNAP “swivel module” (Kang et al., 2018Kang J.Y. Mishanina T.V. Bellecourt M.J. Mooney R.A. Darst S.A. Landick R. RNA polymerase accommodates a pause RNA hairpin by global conformational rearrangements that prolong pausing.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69: 802-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which NusG/Spt5 suppresses pausing is unclear. Eco RfaH is a NusG/Spt5 paralog that does not stimulate ρ, but exhibits strong anti-backtracking activity (like NusG/Spt5), can recruit ribosomes to nascent RNAs via its KOW, and unlike NusG, can counteract the pause-stabilizing effects of nascent RNA hairpins (pause hairpins [PHs]) (Kolb et al., 2014Kolb K.E. Hein P.P. Landick R. Antisense oligonucleotide-stimulated transcriptional pausing reveals RNA exit channel specificity of RNA polymerase and mechanistic contributions of NusA and RfaH.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RfaH is recruited early in transcription units containing the ops sequence, which is exposed in the non-template strand DNA (nt-DNA) of paused elongation complexes (PECs) (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002Artsimovitch I. Landick R. The transcriptional regulator RfaH stimulates RNA chain synthesis after recruitment to elongation complexes by the exposed nontemplate DNA strand.Cell. 2002; 109: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To investigate how interactions of NusG/Spt5/RfaH suppress backtrack and PH-stabilized pausing, and to visualize sequence-specific interaction of RfaH with the nt-DNA of ECs, we determined single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Eco NusG or RfaH bound to an ops-containing EC (opsEC). We used the structures to design and interpret biochemical experiments that probe the interactions of RfaH and NusG with ECs and the mechanism by which they modulate pausing. Together, our results suggest a molecular model for the effects of NusG/Spt5-family proteins on transcription elongation. For cryo-EM structure determination of the NusG-opsEC and RfaH-opsEC, we designed an RNA-DNA scaffold based on the A20 (20-mer RNA transcript with A at the 3′ end) scaffold used previously for cryo-EM structure determination of an Eco EC (Kang et al., 2017Kang J.Y.

NusG suppresses pausing at and downstream of ops, whereas RfaH induces a strong pause 1–2 nt after the ops pause (A20 on the opsEC scaffold) (Figure 1A) (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2000Artsimovitch I.

To ascertain that the opsEC obtained by direct reconstitution on the ops-scaffold supports NusG and RfaH function, we monitored RNA extension of A20 RNA in the presence of NusG or RfaH. In agreement with data obtained on standard templates (Artsimovitch and Landick, 2002Artsimovitch I. Landick R.

We used cryo-EM to determine the Eco NusG-opsEC and RfaH-opsEC structures (Figure 1B). The NusG-opsEC structure was determined to a nominal resolution of 3.7 Å (Figures 1B, S2A, S3, and S4; Table S1). Local resolution calculations indicate that the central core of the structure, including much of NusG, was determined to 3.0–3.5 Å resolution (Figure S3, Figure S4H, S4A, and S4B). Although full-length NusG was used, cryo-EM density for only the NusG-NGN was observed; the flexibly tethered NusG-KOW was disordered (Figure 1B). Density corresponding to the NusG-KOW could not be recovered by focused classification approaches (Scheres, 2012Scheres S.H.W.

The NusG- and RfaH-opsEC structures were nearly as similar to an EC structure as two independently determined EC structures were to each other (Table S2). Initial examination of the structures revealed several key observations. First, both NusG and RfaH-NGN bound to the same location on the upstream face of the EC cleft, covering the single-stranded nt-DNA and upstream fork junction of the transcription bubble (Figure 1B). The location and orientation of the NGN domains is consistent with biochemical analyses of NusG and RfaH interactions with the EC (Belogurov et al., 2007Belogurov G.A. Vassylyeva M.N. Svetlov V.

https://openalex.org/W2806359197,"Summary Mammalian chromosomes are partitioned into A/B compartments and topologically associated domains (TADs). The inactive X (Xi) chromosome, however, adopts a distinct conformation without evident compartments or TADs. Here, through exploration of an architectural protein, structural-maintenance-of-chromosomes hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1), we probe how the Xi is reconfigured during X chromosome inactivation. A/B compartments are first fused into S1 and S2 compartments, coinciding with Xist spreading into gene-rich domains. SMCHD1 then binds S1/S2 compartments and merges them to create a compartment-less architecture. Contrary to current views, TADs remain on the Xi but in an attenuated state. Ablating SMCHD1 results in a persistent S1/S2 organization and strengthening of TADs. Furthermore, loss of SMCHD1 causes regional defects in Xist spreading and erosion of heterochromatic silencing. We present a stepwise model for Xi folding, where SMCHD1 attenuates a hidden layer of Xi architecture to facilitate Xist spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2805725279,"Multiple proteins act co-operatively in mammalian clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to generate endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. The principles controlling the activation and organization of the actin cytoskeleton during mammalian CME are, however, not fully understood. Here, we show that the protein FCHSD2 is a major activator of actin polymerization during CME. FCHSD2 deletion leads to decreased ligand uptake caused by slowed pit maturation. FCHSD2 is recruited to endocytic pits by the scaffold protein intersectin via an unusual SH3-SH3 interaction. Here, its flat F-BAR domain binds to the planar region of the plasma membrane surrounding the developing pit forming an annulus. When bound to the membrane, FCHSD2 activates actin polymerization by a mechanism that combines oligomerization and recruitment of N-WASP to PI(4,5)P2, thus promoting pit maturation. Our data therefore describe a molecular mechanism for linking spatiotemporally the plasma membrane to a force-generating actin platform guiding endocytic vesicle maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2806002088,"As marine ecosystems are influenced by global and regional processes, standardized information on community structure has become crucial for assessing broad-scale responses to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Extensive biogeographic provinces, such as the Brazilian Province in the southwest Atlantic, present numerous theoretical and methodological challenges for understanding community patterns on a macroecological scale. In particular, the Brazilian Province is composed of a complex system of heterogeneous reefs and a few offshore islands, with contrasting histories and geophysical-chemical environments. Despite the large extent of the Brazilian Province (almost 8,000 kilometers), most studies of shallow benthic communities are qualitative surveys and/or have been geographically restricted. We quantified community structure of shallow reef habitats from 0° to 27°S latitude using a standard photographic quadrat technique. Percent cover data indicated that benthic communities of Brazilian reefs were dominated by algal turfs and frondose macroalgae, with low percent cover of reef-building corals. Community composition differed significantly among localities, mostly because of their macroalgal abundance, despite reef type or geographic region, with no evident latitudinal pattern. Benthic diversity was lower in the tropics, contrary to the general latitudinal diversity gradient pattern. Richness peaked at mid-latitudes, between 20°S to 23°S, where it was ~3.5-fold higher than localities with the lowest richness. This study provides the first large-scale description of benthic communities along the southwestern Atlantic, providing a baseline for macroecological comparisons and evaluation of future impacts. Moreover, the new understanding of richness distribution along Brazilian reefs will contribute to conservation planning efforts, such as management strategies and the spatial prioritization for the creation of new marine protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2807394456,"Parkinson’s disease patients report disturbed sleep patterns long before motor dysfunction. Here, in parkin and pink1 models, we identify circadian rhythm and sleep pattern defects and map these to specific neuropeptidergic neurons in fly models and in hypothalamic neurons differentiated from patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Parkin and Pink1 control the clearance of mitochondria by protein ubiquitination. Although we do not observe major defects in mitochondria of mutant neuropeptidergic neurons, we do find an excess of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial contacts. These excessive contact sites cause abnormal lipid trafficking that depletes phosphatidylserine from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and disrupts the production of neuropeptide-containing vesicles. Feeding mutant animals phosphatidylserine rescues neuropeptidergic vesicle production and acutely restores normal sleep patterns in mutant animals. Hence, sleep patterns and circadian disturbances in Parkinson’s disease models are explained by excessive ER-mitochondrial contacts, and blocking their formation or increasing phosphatidylserine levels rescues the defects in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2806057627,"The emergence and dissemination of carbapenemases, bacterial enzymes able to inactivate most β-lactam antibiotics, in Enterobacteriaceae is of increasing concern. The concurrent spread of resistance against colistin, an antibiotic of last resort, further compounds this challenge further. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can play a significant role in the rapid and accurate detection/characterization of existing and emergent resistance determinants, an essential aspect of public health surveillance and response activities to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. In the current study, WGS data was used to characterize the genomic content of antimicrobial resistance genes, including those encoding carbapenemases, in 10 multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from Pakistan. These clinical isolates represented five sequence types: ST11 (n = 3 isolates), ST14 (n = 3), ST15 (n = 1), ST101 (n = 2), and ST307 (n = 1). Resistance profiles against 25 clinically-relevant antimicrobials were determined by broth microdilution; resistant phenotypes were observed for at least 15 of the 25 antibiotics tested in all isolates except one. Specifically, 8/10 isolates were carbapenem-resistant and 7/10 isolates were colistin-resistant. The blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-48 carbapenemase genes were present in 7/10 and 5/10 isolates, respectively; including 2 isolates carrying both genes. No plasmid-mediated determinants for colistin resistance (e.g. mcr) were detected, but disruptions and mutations in chromosomal loci (i.e. mgrB and pmrB) previously reported to confer colistin resistance were observed. A blaOXA-48-carrying IncL/M-type plasmid was found in all blaOXA-48-positive isolates. The application of WGS to molecular epidemiology and surveillance studies, as exemplified here, will provide both a more complete understanding of the global distribution of MDR isolates and a robust surveillance tool useful for detecting emerging threats to public health."
https://openalex.org/W2806328383,"The role of YAP (Yes-associated protein 1) and MRTF-A (myocardin-related transcription factor A), two transcriptional co-activators regulated downstream of GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) and RhoA, in the growth of glioblastoma cells and in vivo glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor development was explored using human glioblastoma cell lines and tumor-initiating cells derived from patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Knockdown of these co-activators in GSC-23 PDX cells using short hairpin RNA significantly attenuated in vitro self-renewal capability assessed by limiting dilution, oncogene expression, and neurosphere formation. Orthotopic xenografts of the MRTF-A and YAP knockdown PDX cells formed significantly smaller tumors and were of lower morbidity than wild-type cells. In vitro studies used PDX and 1321N1 glioblastoma cells to examine functional responses to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a GPCR agonist that activates RhoA signaling, demonstrated that YAP signaling was required for cell migration and invasion, whereas MRTF-A was required for cell adhesion; both YAP and MRTF-A were required for proliferation. Gene expression analysis by RNA-sequencing of S1P-treated MRTF-A or YAP knockout cells identified 44 genes that were induced through RhoA and highly dependent on YAP, MRTF-A, or both. Knockdown of F3 (tissue factor (TF)), a target gene regulated selectively through YAP, blocked cell invasion and migration, whereas knockdown of HBEGF (heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor), a gene selectively induced through MRTF-A, prevented cell adhesion in response to S1P. Proliferation was sensitive to knockdown of target genes regulated through either or both YAP and MRTF-A. Expression of TF and HBEGF was also selectively decreased in tumors from PDX cells lacking YAP or MRTF-A, indicating that these transcriptional pathways are regulated in preclinical GBM models and suggesting that their activation through GPCRs and RhoA contributes to growth and maintenance of human GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2807432808,"2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) modulate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated cell signaling. At high H2O2 levels, eukaryotic Prxs can be inactivated by hyperoxidation and are classified as sensitive Prxs. In contrast, prokaryotic Prxs are categorized as being resistant to hyperoxidation and lack the GGLG and C-terminal YF motifs present in the sensitive Prxs. Additional molecular determinants that account for the subtle differences in the susceptibility to hyperoxidation remain to be identified. A comparison of a new, 2.15-Å-resolution crystal structure of Prx2 in the oxidized, disulfide-bonded state with the hyperoxidized structure of Prx2 and Prx1 in complex with sulfiredoxin revealed three structural regions that rearrange during catalysis. With these regions in hand, focused sequence analyses were performed comparing sensitive and resistant Prx groups. From this combinatorial approach, we discovered two novel hyperoxidation resistance motifs, motifs A and B, which were validated using mutagenesis of sensitive human Prxs and resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium AhpC. Introduction and removal of these motifs, respectively, resulted in drastic changes in the sensitivity to hyperoxidation with Prx1 becoming 100-fold more resistant to hyperoxidation and AhpC becoming 800-fold more sensitive to hyperoxidation. The increased sensitivity of the latter AhpC variant was also confirmed in vivo These results support the function of motifs A and B as primary drivers for tuning the sensitivity of Prxs to different levels of H2O2, thus enabling the initiation of variable signaling or antioxidant responses in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2805882949,"Acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), acting through muscarinic receptors, has an essential role in regulating flexible behavior and working memory (WM). General muscarinic receptor blockade disrupts PFC WM representations, while selective stimulation of muscarinic receptor subtypes is of great interest for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tested selective stimulation and blockade of muscarinic M1 receptors (M1Rs) in macaque PFC, during performance of a cognitive control task in which rules maintained in WM specified saccadic responses. We hypothesized that M1R blockade and stimulation would disrupt and enhance rule representation in WM, respectively. Unexpectedly, M1R blockade did not consistently affect PFC neuronal rule selectivity. Moreover, M1R stimulation suppressed PFC activity, and at higher doses, degraded rule representations. Our results suggest that, in primates, the deleterious effects of general muscarinic blockade on PFC WM activity are not mediated by M1Rs, while their overstimulation deteriorates PFC rule maintenance."

After releasing its cargo, PEX5 has to be extracted from the DTM so that a new protein transport cycle can be initiated. Recycling of PEX5 involves three steps.

Although the general properties of the PEX5-mediated protein import pathway are known, the mechanistic details of each of its steps remain mostly unclear. In this work, we focused on the mechanism used by the REM to extract Ub-PEX5 from the DTM. An abundance of structural/functional data was recently reported for the yeast REM. These include EM structures of the PEX1–PEX6 complex, an X-ray structure of the cytosolic domain of PEX15, and the structure of a trimeric complex containing these three proteins (reviewed in Ref. 38.Tan D.

These studies revealed that PEX1 and PEX6 assemble into a ring-shaped heterohexameric complex, best described as a trimer of PEX1–PEX6 heterodimers, displaying a relatively large pore at its center. These data, together with mutational analyses of PEX1 and PEX6 showing that the conserved hydrophobic residues of the so-called pore loops are important for PEX1–PEX6 function, might suggest that the PEX1–PEX6 complex uses its pore to handle substrates (39.Gardner B.M.

Robust data showing that the PEX1–PEX6 complex indeed unfolds substrates in a pore loop–dependent manner using a processive threading mechanism were reported very recently (42.Gardner B.M.

Surprisingly, the unfolding/threading activity of the PEX1–PEX6 complex was detected using a soluble fragment of PEX15 as substrate, but whether or not PEX15 is a natural substrate for these ATPases remains unknown, as thoroughly discussed by the authors of that work (42.Gardner B.M. Castanzo D.T. Chowdhury S. Stjepanovic G. Stefely M.S. Hurley J.H. Lander G.C. Martin A. The peroxisomal AAA-ATPase Pex1/Pex6 unfolds substrates by processive threading.Nat.

Here, we asked whether or not DTM-embedded Ub-PEX5 displays properties of a bona fide REM substrate. Our data show that DTM-embedded Ub-PEX5 interacts directly with PEX1–PEX6 and is globally unfolded during the ATP-dependent extraction step. This suggests that Ub-PEX5 is indeed a natural substrate of the REM. The results reported below were obtained with a cell-free in vitro system that recapitulates all the steps of the PEX5-mediated protein import pathway. This experimental system was thoroughly described recently (43.Rodrigues T.A. Francisco T. Dias A.F. Pedrosa A.G. Grou C.P. Azevedo J.E. A cell-free organelle-based in vitro system for studying the peroxisomal protein import machinery.Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 (27831570): 2454-246910.1038/nprot.2016.147Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but a brief explanation is provided here for clarity. The core of the system is a rat liver post-nuclear supernatant (PNS; the source of peroxisomes and cytosolic proteins), which is incubated with an in vitro synthesized radiolabeled PEX5 protein under appropriate conditions. During this incubation, a fraction of the radiolabeled PEX5 protein becomes inserted into the peroxisomal DTM, where it is subsequently monoubiquitinated at cysteine 11 and rapidly exported into the cytosol by the REM in an ATP-dependent manner. A number of strategies can be used to block this pathway (43.Rodrigues T.A. Francisco T. Dias A.F. Pedrosa A.G. Grou C.P. Azevedo J.E. A cell-free organelle-based in vitro system for studying the peroxisomal protein import machinery.Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11 (27831570): 2454-246910.1038/nprot.2016.147Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For instance, AMP-PNP and ATPγS, two ATP analogs used in this work, are excellent substrates for the ubiquitin-conjugating cascade (36.Grou C.P. Francisco T. Rodrigues T.A. Freitas M.O. Pinto M.P.

Thus, in vitro assays containing one of these nucleotides will reveal an accumulation of Ub-PEX5 at the peroxisomal DTM, particularly so if the PNS was previously “primed” (i.e. preincubated with a small amount of ATP to release endogenous PEX5 from the DTMs) (25.Alencastre I.S. Rodrigues T.A. Grou C.P. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C. Azevedo J.E. Mapping the cargo protein membrane translocation step into the PEX5 cycling pathway.J. Biol.

Two types of in vitro assays are used here: the so-called single-step and two-step import/export assays. The first involves a single incubation of the reaction mixture. If such an assay is performed in the presence of ATP, then all of the steps of the pathway will occur (i.e. radiolabeled PEX5 will continuously interact with the DTM, where it is monoubiquitinated and subsequently exported into the soluble phase of the assay). Thus, if at the end of the incubation period, the PNS is centrifuged to separate organelles from soluble proteins, most monoubiquitinated PEX5 will be detected in the soluble fraction. In the two-step import/export assay, a radiolabeled PEX5 protein is first accumulated at the DTM in the presence of AMP-PNP or ATPγS (the first step of the assay); the organelles are then isolated by centrifugation, ressuspended, and incubated in buffer containing ATP (the second step) to allow export of the Ub-PEX5 protein into the soluble phase of the assay (36.Grou C.P.

The two-step assay is particularly suited to characterize events downstream of the monoubiquitination step. For practical reasons related to the lability of the thiol ester bond linking ubiquitin to cysteine 11 of PEX5 (29.Carvalho A.F. Pinto M.P. Grou C.P. Alencastre I.S. Fransen M. Sá-Miranda C.

Also, many of the experiments described here were performed with a truncated protein comprising amino acid residues 1–324 of PEX5 and derivatives of it. This protein lacks the globular tetratricopeptide repeat domain of PEX5 and thus is unable to bind efficiently PTS1-containing proteins. However, all of the other functions of the receptor are preserved in this C-terminal truncated species (45.Dias A.F. Rodrigues T.A. Pedrosa A.G. Barros-Barbosa A. Francisco T. Azevedo J.E.

One, a protease-protection assay, explores the fact that PEX5, or truncated versions of it, are extremely sensitive to proteases, such as proteinase K, unless they are inserted into the DTM. In the other, no protease treatment is performed; one just monitors the distribution of monoubiquitinated PEX5 species between the organelle and soluble fractions of the assay by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography. It is important to note that in the latter case, large amounts of nonubiquitinated PEX5 species will be detected in the organelle pellets.

Post-translational phosphorylation is essential to human cellular processes, but the transient, heterogeneous nature of this modification complicates its study in native systems1,2,3. We developed an approach to interrogate phosphorylation and its role in protein-protein interactions on a proteome-wide scale. We genetically encoded phosphoserine in recoded E. coli4,5,6 and generated a peptide-based heterologous representation of the human serine phosphoproteome. We designed a single-plasmid library encoding >100,000 human phosphopeptides and confirmed the site-specific incorporation of phosphoserine in >36,000 of these peptides. We then integrated our phosphopeptide library into an approach known as Hi-P to enable proteome-level screens for serine-phosphorylation-dependent human protein interactions. Using Hi-P, we found hundreds of known and potentially new phosphoserine-dependent interactors with 14-3-3 proteins and WW domains. These phosphosites retained important binding characteristics of the native human phosphoproteome, as determined by motif analysis and pull-downs using full-length phosphoproteins. This technology can be used to interrogate user-defined phosphoproteomes in any organism, tissue, or disease of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2808639160,"Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and / or Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) often complain about sleepiness, fatigue, anxiety and depression. However, common screening questionnaires, like Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) have not been previous evaluated in patients with overlap–coexisting COPD and OSA–syndrome versus patients with OSA alone. Our study compared ESS, FSS and HADS between patients with overlap syndrome and patients with OSA, before and after treatment with Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP). We examined 38 patients with coexisting COPD and OSA versus 38 patients with OSA-only and 28 subjects without respiratory disease, serving as controls. All patients underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs), oximetry and overnight polysomnography and completed the questionnaires, before and after 3 months of CPAP therapy. The two patient groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, Body Mass Index (BMI), neck, waist and hip circumferences, and arterial blood pressure values. They also had similar comorbidities. They differed significantly, as expected, in PFTs (Forced Vital Capacity–FVC, 2.53±0.73 vs 3.08±0.85 lt, p = 0.005, Forced Expiratory Volume in 1sec–FEV1, 1.78±0.53 vs 2.60±0.73 lt/min, p<0.001) and in daytime oximetry (94.75±2.37 vs 96.13±1.56%, p = 0.007). ESS, HADS–Anxiety and HADS–Depression scores did not differ statistically significant between these two groups, whereas overlap syndrome patients expressed significantly more fatigue (FSS) than OSA-only patients, a finding that persisted even after 3 months of CPAP therapy. We conclude that sleepiness, anxiety and depression were similar in both groups, whereas fatigue was more prominent in patients with overlap syndrome than in sleep apneic patients and did not ameliorate after treatment."

It seems that not all Aβ toxicity is governed by PrPC; however, this does not preclude an important role for PrPC in mediating aspects of Aβ toxicity. Different Aβ assemblies and locations may well have different modes of toxic action; therefore these conflicting observations may simply reflect differences in genetic backgrounds and the nature of the Aβ-oligomers. In mammals, PrPC is expressed at high levels and is concentrated at the synaptic terminals, anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety (32Herms J. Tings T. Gall S. Madlung A. Giese A. Siebert H. Schürmann P. Windl O. Brose N. Kretzschmar H. Evidence of presynaptic location and function of the prion protein.J.

Like Aβ, PrPC can also form amyloid fibers, and this conformational transition is linked to a range of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in humans and mammals (33Prusiner S.B. Prions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95 (9811807): 13363-1338310.1073/pnas.95.23.13363Crossref PubMed Scopus (5147) Google Scholar). Mammalian cellular prion proteins have a high structural and sequence homology and consist of two structurally distinct domains (34Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E.

The C-terminal domain (residues 126–231) is predominantly α-helical, whereas the Cu2+-binding N-terminal half of PrPC (residues 23–126) is natively disordered (35Viles J.H. Donne D. Kroon G.

The mechanism by which PrPC mediates Aβ toxicity is not well understood. In vitro, it is known that substoichiometric quantities of PrPC may trap Aβ as an oligomeric conformer and inhibit its progression to amyloid fibers (14Younan N.D. Sarell C.J. Davies P. Brown D.R. Viles J.H.

Furthermore, PrPC can also disassemble preformed Aβ40 fibrils (14Younan N.D. Sarell C.J. Davies P. Brown D.R. Viles J.H.

Combining both Aβ and PrP expression in the normally naïve brain of a fruit fly offers a powerful tool for measuring the potential of these proteins to show synergistic phenotypic enhancements. In particular, we show co-expression of Aβ and PrPC enhancing both longevity and circadian behavioral deficits in our fly model, under conditions where each protein alone has no effect. We used Drosophila as a model organism to look for in vivo interactions between Aβ and mammalian PrPC in a system that is normally naïve to both proteins. When flies have low levels of transgene expression—that is when cultured at 25 °C with single copy transgenes—neither the expression of mammalian PrPC nor the less neurotoxic Aβ isoforms (Aβ40 and Aβ42) alone reduced the lifespan of the flies. As expected, the highly aggregation prone Aβ42Arc (E22G arctic mutant) did reduce median survival by a third (Fig. 1 and Table 1). However, when PrPC was co-expressed with the same Aβ isoforms, in each case there was a significant decrease in the longevity of the flies. This effect was clearly synergistic for the combinations of PrPC with Aβ40 or Aβ42 (Fig. 1, A and B). In all cases the PrP-A-β interactions significantly reduced median survival as compared with the flies expressing either of the proteins alone, the effect being most marked for the interaction of PrPC with Aβ42 and Aβ42Arc (Fig. 1, B and C) where median survival times were halved (Table 1). The median survival times are presented in Fig. 1D where median data points represent vials of 10 flies, with a total of 400 flies/condition.Table 1Longevity assays for eight genotypes51DPrPC51D62 ± 765 ± 8Aβ4070 ± 651 ± 8Aβ4269 ± 536 ± 5Aβ42Arc44 ± 520 ± 2 Open table in a new tab One of the earliest features of AD and the fly model of Aβ toxicity is a progressive disruption in circadian rhythms, in particular the normal daily sleep–wake pattern.

https://openalex.org/W2807156804,"Cryptococcosis is considered endemic in Amazonas state, occurring more frequently in individuals with AIDS, who are predominantly infected by Cryptococcus neoformans molecular type VNI. Infections by Cryptococcus gattii VGII predominate in immunocompetent hosts from the American continent and are associated with outbreaks in North America, particularly the subtypes VGIIa and VGIIb, which are also present in the Brazilian Amazon region. Despite few environmental studies, several aspects of the molecular epidemiology of this disease in Amazonas remain unclear, including the limited use of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to evaluate the genetic population structure of clinical isolates, mainly C. neoformans. Therefore, we used MLST to identify the sequence types of 38 clinical isolates of C. neoformans VNI and C. gattii VGII and used phylogenetic analysis to evaluate their genetic relationship to global isolates. Records of 30 patients were analyzed to describe the current scenario of cryptococcosis in the region and their associations with the different subtypes. Broth microdilution was also performed to determine the susceptibility profile to the antifungals amphotericin B, fluconazole and itraconazole. MLST identified that patients with HIV (n = 26) were exclusively affected by VNI strains with ST93, and among the VGII strains (n = 4), three STs (ST5, ST172 and the new ST445) were identified. An in-hospital lethality of 54% was observed in the HIV group, and there were no significant differences in the clinical aspects of the disease between the HIV and non-HIV groups of patients. In addition, all isolates were susceptible to the antifungals tested. Therefore, in Amazonas state, VNI isolates are a genetically monotypic group, with ST93 being highly important in HIV individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2808141793,"Background 
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of prison release on HIV incidence in the southern region of the United States, the region with the highest rates of both incarceration and new HIV diagnoses nationwide.


Methods 
5-year HIV diagnoses rates were calculated at the ZIP code level for nine cities and metropolitan statistical areas in the US South (ZIP codes, N = 600). Multilevel regression models were constructed and adjusted rate ratios (ARRs) were estimated for overall, male and female HIV diagnoses rates.


Results 
Across the nine cities, in multilevel, multivariate analysis, controlling for income inequality (GINI coefficient), percent living in poverty and percent Non-Hispanic Black population, the ZIP code level overall HIV diagnosis rate was significantly associated with prison release [ARR 1.004 (95%CI 1.0007, 1.006), p<0.01]. A 10-person increase in prison release rate would result in a 4% increase in overall 5-year HIV diagnosis rate—approximately 9.4 additional cases per 100,000 population. In gender-stratified models, prison release rate was significantly associated with the ZIP code level HIV diagnosis rate for males [ARR 1.004 (95%CI 1.0004, 1.007), p<0.01], but not for females.


Conclusions 
In the southern region of the US, prison release is significantly associated with HIV incidence. HIV prevention interventions should promote timely linkage to ongoing treatment for released inmates living with HIV."

Here, we found that porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) nsp15 primarily exists as dimers and monomers in vitro. Biological experiments reveal that a PDCoV nsp15 mutant lacking the first 27 amino acids of the N-terminal domain (Asn-1–Asn-27) forms more monomers and displays decreased enzymatic activity, indicating that this region is important for its dimerization. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments and three-dimensional structural analysis indicated that the C-terminal region (His-251–Val-261) of PDCoV nsp15 is 10 amino acids shorter and forms a shorter loop than that formed by the equivalent sequence (Gln-259–Phe-279) of SARS-CoV nsp15. This result may explain why PDCoV nsp15 failed to form hexamers. We speculate that NendoUs may have originated from XendoU endoribonucleases (XendoUs) forming monomers in eukaryotic cells, that NendoU from arterivirus gained the ability to form dimers, and that the coronavirus variants then evolved the capacity to assemble into hexamers. We further propose that PDCoV nsp15 may be an intermediate in this evolutionary process.

Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from S. suis has been suggested to contribute to its virulence, and absence of d-alanylation from the S. suis LTA is associated with increased susceptibility to cationic antimicrobial peptides. Here, using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and MS analyses, we characterized the LTA structures from three S. suis serotype 2 strains differing in virulence, sequence type (ST), and geographical origin. Our analyses revealed that these strains possess-in addition to the typical type I LTA present in other streptococci-a second, mixed-type series of LTA molecules of high complexity. We observed a ST-specific difference in the incorporation of glycosyl residues into these mixed-type LTAs. We found that strains P1/7 (ST1, high virulence) and SC84 (ST7, very high virulence) can attach a 1,2-linked α-d-Glcp residue as branching substituent to an α-d-Glcp that is 1,3-linked to glycerol phosphate moieties and that is not present in strain 89-1591 (ST25, intermediate virulence). In contrast, the latter strain could glycosylate its LTA at the glycerol O-2 position, which was not observed in the other two strains. Using LTA preparations from WT strains and from mutants with an inactivated prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase, resulting in deficient lipoprotein acylation, we show that S. suis LTAs alone do not induce Toll-like receptor 2-dependent pro-inflammatory mediator production from dendritic cells. In summary, our study reveals an unexpected complexity of LTAs present in three S. suis serotype 2 strains differing in genetic background and virulence."

The structure of the O-mannosyl glycan is crucial to its interaction with several extracellular matrix components, such as laminin, and aberrant O-mannosyl glycans of α-DG are the cause of α-dystroglycanopathy, a group of congenital muscular dystrophies with neuronal migration defects (1.Manya H.

The same group also reported that GroP modifications as well as RboP modifications were not observed in FKTN-deficient cells, implying that FKTN may be involved in transferring not only RboP but also GroP to the phospho-core M3 structure. However, whether FKTN itself has GroP transferase activity and whether GroP substitution affects the synthesis of the functional core M3–type glycan remain unclear. In Gram-positive bacteria, several GroP transferases are known to transfer the GroP moiety from the activated precursor CDP-glycerol (CDP-Gro) in the biosynthesis of teichoic acid, a major cell wall component (13.Brown S. Santa Maria Jr, J.P. Walker S. Wall teichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67 (24024634): 313-33610.1146/annurev-micro-092412-155620Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, these GroP transferases are not conserved in mammals, and to date, no GroP transferases have been identified in mammals. In the present study, we report that FKTN and FKRP have GroP transfer activity using CDP-Gro as a donor substrate. We also demonstrate that GroP substitution of a phospho-core M3 unit by FKTN inhibits further elongation of the outer glycan chain. Furthermore, we show the inhibitory effect of CDP-Gro on the RboP transferase activity of FKTN and FKRP. The present data suggest the inhibitory function of CDP-Gro in the synthesis of α-DG glycan. To determine whether FKTN has GroP transferase activity as well as RboP transferase activity to the phospho-core M3 unit, we prepared a soluble form of FKTN with a His/Myc tag at the N terminus (sFKTN) and a synthetic phospho-core M3 peptide (AT*PAPVAAIGPK) modified with phospho-core M3 at the Thr* as an acceptor substrate. sFKTN was expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated from the culture medium using an anti-c-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitated sFKTN was found to be of the appropriate molecular weight by Western blotting (Fig. 1A), and the purity of sFKTN was checked by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. S1A). To confirm the enzymatic activity of sFKTN, sFKTN was incubated with CDP-Rbo (Fig. 1B) and the phospho-core M3 peptide, and the products were separated by HPLC. In the HPLC chromatogram, shown in Fig. 1C, a small peak of the acceptor substrate (phospho-core M3 peptide; indicated as S) and a large peak of the RboP-transferred product (RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide; indicated as P1) were detected as reported previously (4.Kanagawa M. Kobayashi K. Tajiri M. Manya H. Kuga A. Yamaguchi Y. Akasaka-Manya K. Furukawa J.I. Mizuno M. Kawakami H. Shinohara Y. Wada Y. Endo T. Toda T.

Because CDP-Gro is a known donor substrate for GroP transferase in bacterial teichoic acid biosynthesis (13.Brown S. Santa Maria Jr, J.P. Walker S. Wall teichoic acids of gram-positive bacteria.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 67 (24024634): 313-33610.1146/annurev-micro-092412-155620Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), we examined whether sFKTN has GroP transferase activity using CDP-Gro as a donor substrate. Commercially available CDP-Gro (Sigma) is a mixture of enantiomers CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro (Fig. 1B), and these isomers can serve as the donors for sn-glycerol 1-phosphate (Gro1P) and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (Gro3P), respectively. Because whether the GroP on the core M3–type glycan of recombinant α-DG (12.Yagi H. Kuo C.W. Obayashi T. Ninagawa S. Khoo K.H. Kato K. Direct mapping of additional modifications on phosphorylated O-glycans of α-dystroglycan by mass spectrometry analysis in conjunction with knocking out of causative genes for dystroglycanopathy.Mol.

As shown in Fig. 1D, a new small peak was detected in the presence of sFKTN (lower panel, indicated by P2) but not when sFKTN was absent (upper panel). The fraction containing peak P2 was isolated and analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS. The m/z value of P2 was 1935.9, which corresponds to the [M + H]+ ion of the GroP-transferred phospho-core M3 peptide (GroP + GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man peptide) (Fig. 1E) estimated based on the molecular weight of each component: GroP, 172.0; GalNAc or GlcNAc, 221.2; Man, 180.1; phosphoric acid, 97.9; peptide, 1132.6; and H2O, 18.0. To confirm the components of P2, the peak at m/z 1935.9 was subjected to MS/MS analysis. As shown in Fig. 1F, four fragment ions were detected at m/z 1781.8 (GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide), m/z 1578.7 (GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide), m/z 1375.7 ((P)Man-peptide), and m/z 1133.6 (peptide), indicating that the peak at m/z 1935.9 is the GroP-substituted phospho-core M3 peptide. The peak at m/z 1763.8 corresponds to the dehydrated form of m/z 1781.8. There were no obvious peaks in the MS/MS spectrum containing GroP, which suggested that GroP is attached to the terminal GalNAc of the phospho-core M3. The position to which the GroP is transferred is further analyzed below. To determine the position on the phospho-core M3 peptide to which sFKTN transfers GroP, we used exo-β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (HexNAcase) from jack bean. Because HexNAcase can remove nonreducing, terminal β-linked HexNAc (GlcNAc and GalNAc) residues but cannot cleave modified HexNAc (nonterminal HexNAc), HexNAcase can be used to determine whether the terminal GalNAc is modified with GroP. To confirm the enzymatic activity of HexNAcase toward β1–3-linked GalNAc, the phospho-core M3 peptide was treated with HexNAcase, and the product was analyzed by HPLC and MS. A new peak (indicated as S′) was observed in the HPLC chromatogram after HexNAcase treatment (Fig. 2A), and the fraction containing the substrate (S) and product (S′) were subjected to MS analysis. In addition to the substrate (S) peak at m/z 1781.9 (GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide), two major peaks at m/z 1578.7 (GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide) and m/z 1375.7 ((P)Man-peptide) were observed after HexNAcase treatment (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the terminal GalNAc was removed and that the resulting terminally exposed GlcNAc was also removed. Under these experimental conditions, the GroP-substituted phospho-core M3 peptide (P2) was treated with HexNAcase, and the product was analyzed by HPLC. The intensities of peak P2 with or without HexNAcase treatment were comparable (Fig. 2C), although a very small product peak (S′) was observed after HexNAcase treatment in Fig. 2C because the P2 fraction contained a small amount of phospho-core M3 peptide (S) as a contaminant during the isolation of the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide synthesized from the phospho-core M3 peptide by sFKTN. MS analysis of the eluates around peak P2 showed that the substrate (P2) peak is the only GroP-containing peak regardless of HexNAcase treatment (Fig. 2D), indicating that the GroP substituent on the phospho-core M3 peptide was not cleaved by HexNAcase digestion. These results show that sFKTN transferred GroP to the terminal GalNAc of the phospho-core M3 peptide, and this result is consistent with the previous report that GroP is linked to the terminal GalNAc of the phospho-core M3 unit on recombinant α-DG (12.Yagi H. Kuo C.W. Obayashi T. Ninagawa S. Khoo K.H. Kato K. Direct mapping of additional modifications on phosphorylated O-glycans of α-dystroglycan by mass spectrometry analysis in conjunction with knocking out of causative genes for dystroglycanopathy.Mol.

Next, to determine which enantiomer, CDP–1-Gro or CDP–3-Gro (or both), serves as the donor for sFKTN, we synthesized both isomers using glycerol-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT), which catalyzes the production of CDP-Gro from CTP and GroP in microorganisms (14.Park Y.S. Sweitzer T.D. Dixon J.E. Kent C. Expression, purification, and characterization of CTP:glycerol-3-phosphate cytidylyltransferase from Bacillus subtilis.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268 (8393871): 16648-16654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the GCT reaction, we used a GCT from the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus, AQ1368, which has been shown to synthesize CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro using Gro1P and Gro3P, respectively (Fig. S2A) (15.Rodrigues M.V. Borges N. Santos H. Glycerol phosphate cytidylyltransferase stereospecificity is key to understanding the distinct stereochemical compositions of glycerophosphoinositol in Bacteria and Archaea.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 83 (27795311): e02462-1610.1128/AEM.02462-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We expressed His-tagged recombinant AQ1368 in Escherichia coli. The purified His-tagged AQ1368 (Fig. S2B) was incubated with CTP and either Gro1P or Gro3P. The reaction products were separated by HPLC, and the peak corresponding to CDP-Gro was collected (Fig. S2C). The purities of CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro were verified by HPLC (Fig. S2D). HPLC-MS analysis was used to confirm the production of CDP-Gro (Fig. S3). Then, sFKTN was incubated with the phospho-core M3 peptide and CDP–1-Gro or CDP–3-Gro, and the products were analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, a new small peak (indicated by an open triangle) was detected in the chromatograms after the reaction with CDP–1-Gro or CDP–3-Gro as was the case with mix-CDP-Gro (Fig. 1D). The fractions containing the reaction product with CDP–1-Gro or CDP–3-Gro were subjected to MS analyses, and the m/z value of the products was 1936.1 or 1936.0, respectively, corresponding to the [M + H]+ ion of the GroP-transferred phospho-core M3 peptide (GroP + GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man peptide) (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that sFKTN transfers both Gro1P and Gro3P from CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro, respectively. To compare the efficiency of CDP-Rbo, CDP–1-Gro, and CDP–3-Gro as donor substrates for sFKTN, kinetic experiments were performed using increasing concentrations of each donor and 100 μm phospho-core M3 peptide. As shown in Fig. 4A, the transfer reactions of RboP, Gro1P, or Gro3P in the presence of CDP-Rbo, CDP–1-Gro, or CDP–3-Gro, respectively, followed typical Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Analysis of the results using a Lineweaver–Burk plot (Fig. 4B) yielded Km values for CDP-Rbo, CDP–1-Gro, and CDP–3-Gro of 30.8 ± 5.5, 39.4 ± 3.7, and 27.3 ± 1.6 μm, respectively, and Vmax values for CDP-Rbo, CDP–1-Gro, and CDP–3-Gro of 5.53 ± 0.15, 1.01 ± 0.19, and 0.45 ± 0.06 μm/h, respectively (Fig. 4C). The relative catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) values of sFKTN for CDP-Rbo, CDP–1-Gro, and CDP–3-Gro were 0.184 ± 0.034, 0.026 ± 0.007, and 0.017 ± 0.003, respectively (Fig. 4C), indicating that the transfer efficiency of RboP from CDP-Rbo is approximately 10 times higher than those of Gro1P and Gro3P from CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro, respectively. Based on these results, CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro are less efficient donor substrates for sFKTN than CDP-Rbo. Although CDP–1-Gro appears to be a better substrate for sFKTN than CDP–3-Gro, both CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro serve as significant donor substrates. In addition, when a mixture of equal amounts of CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro was used as the donor substrate, medial GroP (Gro1P/Gro3P) transfer activity was observed (Fig. S4). This result suggests that CDP–1-Gro and CDP–3-Gro do not affect the Gro3P and Gro1P transfer activities of sFKTN, respectively. Therefore, we used mix-CDP-Gro (Sigma) in subsequent experiments, and hereafter, we refer to mix-CDP-Gro simply as CDP-Gro except where otherwise indicated. Because sFKTN can transfer both RboP and GroP, we were curious to determine the effect of GroP modification of phospho-core M3 on the synthesis of core M3–type glycan. To this aim, we examined whether the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide serves as an acceptor substrate for FKRP, the enzyme immediately downstream of FKTN. sFKRP was expressed in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated from the culture medium. The immunoprecipitated sFKRP was confirmed to have the appropriate molecular weight by Western blotting (Fig. 5A), and the purity of sFKRP was checked by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. S1B). To confirm the enzymatic activity of sFKRP, sFKRP was incubated with CDP-Rbo and the RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide, which is the usual acceptor for FKRP, and the products were analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 5B, an sFKRP product (RboP–RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide) was detected in the chromatogram (peak P3), and the content of the substrate (P1; RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide) was markedly reduced by the presence of sFKRP (lower panel). MS analysis of the fraction containing peaks P1 and P3 confirmed the production of RboP-transferred RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide (P3) (Fig. 5C). Then, sFKRP was incubated with CDP-Rbo and the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide, and the products were analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 5D, two peaks were detected in both the absence and presence of sFKRP; the large peak (P2) corresponds to the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide, and the small peak (S) corresponds to the phospho-core M3 peptide, which is present as a contaminant during the isolation of the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide. The peak pattern in the chromatogram after the reaction with sFKRP was almost entirely the same as that of the reaction in the absence of sFKRP, and no new peaks were detected (Fig. 5D, lower panel), demonstrating that RboP was not transferred to the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide by sFKRP. MS analysis of the eluate around peak P2 (Fig. 5D, lower panel) confirmed that RboP-transferred GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide (calculated m/z value, 2149.9) was not produced (Fig. 5E). These results indicate that the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide cannot serve as an acceptor for sFKRP.

Therefore, sFKRP was incubated with CDP-Gro and its usual acceptor, the RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide, and the products were analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 6A, a new small peak (indicated as P4) was detected in addition to the substrate peak (P1; RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide) in the chromatogram after the reaction in the presence of sFKRP (lower panel) but not in that after the reaction without sFKRP (upper panel). The fraction containing peaks P1 and P4 was subjected to MS analysis, and the results showed that the m/z value of P4 was 2149.8, which corresponds to the [M + H]+ ion of the GroP-transferred RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide (GroP + RboP-GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man peptide) (Fig. 6B). The components of P4 were further confirmed by MS/MS analysis of the peak at m/z 2149.8. As shown in Fig. 6C, five fragment ions were detected at m/z 1995.8 (RboP-GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide), m/z 1781.8 (GalNAc-GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide), m/z 1578.8 (GlcNAc-(P)Man-peptide), m/z 1375.7 ((P)Man-peptide), and m/z 1133.7 (peptide), indicating that the peak at m/z 2149.8 is the GroP-substituted RboP-phospho-core M3 peptide. No obvious peaks containing GroP were detected in the MS/MS spectrum, suggesting that GroP is attached to the terminal RboP. These results indicate that sFKRP also has GroP transfer activity using CDP-Gro as a donor. In addition, the HPLC data show that the GroP-transferred product peak (Fig. 6A, lower panel, P4) is smaller than the RboP-transferred product peak (Fig. 5B, lower panel, P3) using the same enzyme assay conditions, suggesting that CDP-Gro is a less efficient donor for sFKRP than CDP-Rbo, which is the case with sFKTN. We further examined whether sFKRP can transfer GroP to the GroP-transferred phospho-core M3 peptide. sFKRP was incubated with CDP-Gro and the GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide, and the products were analyzed by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 6D, the substrate peak (GroP-phospho-core M3 peptide; indicated by P2) and the associated peak (phospho-core M3 peptide; indicated by S) were detected, as shown in Fig. 5D, but no new peaks were detected, indicating that sFKRP cannot transfer GroP to the GroP-transferred phospho-core M3 peptide.

Here we investigated the potential transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms by which everolimus attenuated EC activation after DES. We studied the effect of everolimus on E-selectin (SELE) and VCAM1 mRNA levels when human coronary artery (HCAECs) and human umbilical vein ECs were challenged with recombinant TNF-α (100 ng/mL) for 1–24 hours in the presence or absence of everolimus using 0.5 μM concentration locally maintained by DES. EC activation was evaluated via the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNAs with miR-155 expression by RT-qPCR as well as the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) detected by fluorescence microscopy. To investigate the transcriptional regulation of E-selectin and VCAM-1, TNF-α-induced enhancer RNA (eRNA) expression at p65-bound enhancers in the neighboring genomic regions of SELE and VCAM1 genes, including SELE_-11Kb and VCAM1_-10Kb, were measured in HCAECs. Mature and precursor levels of E-selectin and VCAM-1 repressor miR-181b were quantified to analyze the post-transcriptional regulation of these genes in HCAECs. Circulating miR-181b was analyzed in plasma samples of stented subjects by stem-loop RT-qPCR. TNF-α highly elevated E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression at transcriptional level in ECs. Levels of mature, pre- and pri-miR-181b were repressed in ECs by TNF-α, while everolimus acted as a negative regulator of EC activation via inhibited translocation of NF-κB p65 subunit into cell nuclei, lowered eRNA expression at SELE and VCAM1 genes-associated enhancers and modulated expression of their post-transcriptional repressor miR-181b. Significant negative correlation was observed between plasma miR-181b and soluble E-selectin and VCAM-1 in patients. In conclusion, everolimus attenuates EC activation via reduced NF-κB p65 translocation causing decreased E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level after DES."

We have incorporated several new raphid pennates into a three gene phylogenetic dataset (SSU, rbcL, psbC), and recover Gomphonemopsis sp. as sister to P. tricornutum with 100% BS support. This is the first time a close relative has been identified for P. tricornutum with robust statistical support. We test and reject a succession of hypotheses for other relatives. Our molecular data are statistically significantly incongruent with placement of either or both species among the Cymbellales, an order of diatoms with which both have been associated. We believe that further resolution of the phylogenetic position of P. tricornutum will rely more on increased taxon sampling than increased genetic sampling. Gomphonemopsis is a benthic diatom, and its phylogenetic relationship with P. tricornutum is congruent with the hypothesis that P. tricornutum is a benthic diatom with specific adaptations that lead to active recruitment into the plankton. We hypothesize that other benthic diatoms are likely to have similar adaptations and are not merely passively recruited into the plankton."
https://openalex.org/W2808181786,"Background Mitochondria hold crucial importance in organs with high energy demand especially the heart. We investigated whether chronic kidney disease (CKD), which eventually culminates in cardiorenal syndrome, could affect cardiac mitochondria and assessed the potential involvement of angiotensin II (AngII) in the process. Methods Male Lewis rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy allowing CKD development for eight months or for eleven weeks. Short-term CKD rats were administered with AngII receptor blocker (ARB). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and cardiac sections were evaluated for interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocytes’ hypertrophy. Electron microscopy was used to explore the spatial organization of the cardiomyocytes. Expression levels of mitochondrial content and activity markers were tested in order to delineate the underlying mechanisms for mitochondrial pathology in the CKD setting with or without ARB administration. Results CKD per-se resulted in induced cardiac interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyocytes’ hypertrophy combined with a marked disruption of the mitochondrial structure. Moreover, CKD led to enhanced cytochrome C leakage to the cytosol and to enhanced PARP-1 cleavage which are associated with cellular apoptosis. ARB treatment did not improve kidney function but markedly reduced left ventricular mass, cardiomyocytes’ hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Interestingly, ARB administration improved the spatial organization of cardiac mitochondria and reduced their increased volume compared to untreated CKD animals. Nevertheless, ARB did not improve mitochondrial content, mitochondrial biogenesis or the respiratory enzyme activity. ARB mildly upregulated protein levels of mitochondrial fusion-related proteins. Conclusions CKD results in cardiac pathological changes combined with mitochondrial damage and elevated apoptotic markers. We anticipate that the increased mitochondrial volume mainly represents mitochondrial swelling that occurs during the pathological process of cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic administration of ARB may improve the pathological appearance of the heart. Further recognition of the molecular pathways leading to mitochondrial insult and appropriate intervention is of crucial importance."

S. agalactiae contains the CAMP factor, a pore-forming toxin first identified in this bacterium. The CAMP reaction is based on the co-hemolytic activity of the CAMP factor and is commonly used to identify S. agalactiae in the clinic. Closely related proteins are present also in other Gram-positive pathogens. Although the CAMP toxin was discovered more than a half century ago, no structure from this toxin family has been reported, and the mechanism of action of this toxin remains unclear. Here, we report the first structure of this toxin family, revealing a structural fold composed of 5 + 3-helix bundles. Further analysis by protein truncation and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the N-terminal 5-helix bundle is responsible for membrane permeabilization, whereas the C-terminal 3-helix bundle is likely responsible for host receptor binding. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain inhibited the activity of both full-length toxin and its N-terminal domain. Moreover, we observed that the linker region is highly conserved and has a conserved DLXXXDXAT sequence motif. Structurally, this linker region extensively interacted with both terminal CAMP factor domains, and mutagenesis disclosed that the conserved sequence motif is required for CAMP factor's co-hemolytic activity.

To explore whether the ACE inhibitor ramipril has a direct effect on the microvasculature beyond the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect, we investigated whether ramipril improved coronary microvascular function in normotensive women with coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). Methods We included 63 normotensive women with angina, no epicardial stenosis>50% and CMD defined as a coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR)<2.2 assessed by adenosine stress-echocardiography in a randomized double-blinded, superiority trial with 1:1 allocation to placebo or ramipril (maximum dose 10 mg depending on blood pressure) for 24±6 weeks. Primary outcome was CFVR. Secondary outcomes were left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and symptoms evaluated by Seattle Angina Questionnaire (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02525081). Results Follow-up was available on 55 patients. BP remained unchanged during treatment in both groups. CFVR improved in both the ramipril (p = 0.004) and placebo group (p = 0.026) with no difference between groups (p = 0.63). Symptoms improved in both groups with no significant between-group differences. No changes were detected in parameters of systolic and diastolic function. No serious adverse reactions were reported. Conclusions In normotensive women with angina and CMD, treatment with ramipril had no significant effect on CFVR or symptoms compared with placebo. The effect of ACE inhibition previously reported may be mediated by blood pressure reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2807823925,"Background Large and giant dog breeds have a high risk for gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) which is an acute, life-threatening condition. Previous work by our group identified a strong risk of GDV linked to specific alleles in innate and adaptive immune genes. We hypothesize that variation in the genes of the immune system act through modulation of the gut microbiome, or through autoimmune mechanisms, or both, to predispose dogs to this condition. Here, we investigate whether differences in the canine fecal microbiome are associated with GDV and are linked to previously identified risk alleles. Methodology/Principle findings Fecal samples from healthy Great Danes (n = 38), and dogs with at least one occurrence of GDV (n = 37) were collected and analyzed by paired-end sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Dietary intake and temperament were estimated from a study-specific dietary and temperament questionnaire. Dogs with GDV had significantly more diverse fecal microbiomes than healthy control dogs. Alpha diversity was significantly increased in dogs with GDV, as well as dogs with at least one risk allele for DRB1 and TRL5. We found no significant association of dietary intake and GDV. Dogs with GDV showed a significant expansion of the rare lineage Actinobacteria (p = 0.004), as well as a significantly greater abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.004) and a significantly lower abundance of Bacteroidetes (p<0.004). There was a significant difference in the abundance of 10 genera but after correction for multiple comparisons, none were significant. Bacterial phyla were significantly different between controls and dogs with GDV and at least one risk allele for DRB1 and TRL5. Actinobacteria were significantly higher in dogs with GDV and with one risk allele for DRB1 and TLR5 but not DLA88 genes. Furthermore, Collinsella was significantly increased in dogs with at least one risk allele for DRB1 and TLR5. Logistic regression showed that a model which included Actinobacteria, at least one risk allele,and temperament, explained 29% of the variation in risk of GDV in Great Danes. Conclusions The microbiome in GDV was altered by an expansion of a minor lineage and was associated with specific alleles of both innate and adaptive immunity genes. These associations are consistent with our hypothesis that immune genes may play a role in predisposition to GDV by altering the gut microbiome. Further research will be required to directly test the causal relationships of immune genes, the gut microbiome and GDV."

https://openalex.org/W2805986673,"Background Individuals under community corrections supervision may be at increased risk for food insecurity because they face challenges similar to other marginalized populations, such as people experiencing housing instability or substance users. The prevalence of food insecurity and its correlates have not been studied in the community corrections population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2016, surveying 304 probationers in Rhode Island to estimate the prevalence of food insecurity, identify food acquisition methods, and determine characteristics of groups most at-risk for food insecurity. We used chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests to assess differences in sociodemographics and eating and food acquisition patterns, GIS to examine geospatial differences, and ordinal logistic regression to identify independent correlates across the four levels of food security. Results Nearly three-quarters (70.4%) of the participants experienced food insecurity, with almost half (48.0%) having very low food security. This is substantially higher than the general population within the state of Rhode Island, which reported a prevalence of 12.8% food insecurity with 6.1% very low food security in 2016. Participants with very low food security most often acquired lunch foods from convenience stores (and less likely from grocery stores) compared to the other three levels of food security. Participants did not differ significantly with regards to places for food acquisition related to breakfast or dinner meals based upon food security status. In adjusted models, being homeless (AOR 2.34, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.18) and depressed (AOR 3.12, 95% CI: 1.98, 4.91) were independently associated with a greater odds of being in a food insecure group. Compared to having help with meals none of the time, participants who reported having meal help all of the time (AOR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.64), most of the time (AOR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.61), and some of the time (AOR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.98) had a lower odds of being in a food insecure group. Food insecure participants resided in different neighborhoods than food secure participants. The highest density of food insecure participants resided in census tracts with the lowest median incomes for the general population. The areas of highest density for each level of food security for our participants were in the census tracts with the lowest levels of full-time employment for the general population. Conclusions The prevalence of food insecurity and very low food security were markedly higher in our probation population compared to the general RI population. These findings suggest that access to food on a regular basis is a challenge for adults on probation. Depression and being homeless were independently associated with a greater odds of being in a food insecure group. In addition to intervening directly on food insecurity, developing interventions and policies that address the contributing factors of food insecurity, such as safe housing and treatment for depression, are critical."
https://openalex.org/W2808342445,"Introduction The April 2015 Nepal earthquake resulted in more than 8,700 deaths and 22,000 casualties including damage to health facilities. The impact of this situation on chronic conditions such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) may become a long-lasting public health threat. Therefore, the objectives of this study were i) to assess the association of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence with mental health problems, and social behaviors, ii) to examine factors affecting treatment failure, and iii) to investigate changes in ART adherence and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among people living with HIV 6 and 12 months after the disaster. Methods Study was conducted 6 months after the earthquake in 2015 with a sample size of 305 earthquake victims with HIV and followed after 12 months of the earthquake. A logistic regression analysis was used to examine relationships, while a paired t-test analysis was conducted to assess changes in adherence to ART and PTSD level at 6 months and 12 months after earthquake. Results In the earthquake, 5.2% of the participants lost their family member. Approximately 44% of participants had earthquake-PTSD symptoms and 50% experienced HIV stigma. PTSD and HIV status disclosure were significantly associated with adherence to ART, while HIV stigma and religion were associated with treatment failure. PTSD and adherence levels to ART were significantly improved over the 6-month period. Conclusion Awareness programs for general public to eliminate HIV stigma; promote psychosocial counseling to earthquake victims living with HIV in order to reduce PTSD will contribute to maintaining optimal ART adherence and to prevent treatment failure."
https://openalex.org/W2808354740,"Dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) is the penultimate step in triglyceride synthesis. Adipocytes express soluble intracellular PA-specific phosphatases (Lipins) and broader specificity membrane-associated lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) that can also dephosphorylate PA. Inactivation of lipin1 causes lipodystrophy in mice due to defective developmental adipogenesis. Triglyceride synthesis is diminished but not ablated by inactivation of lipin1 in differentiated adipocytes implicating other PA phosphatases in this process. To investigate the possible role of LPPs in adipocyte lipid metabolism and signaling we made mice with adipocyte-targeted inactivation of LPP3 encoded by the Plpp3(Ppap2b) gene. Adipocyte LPP3 deficiency resulted in blunted ceramide and sphingomyelin accumulation during diet-induced adipose tissue expansion, accumulation of the LPP3 substrate sphingosine 1- phosphate, and reduced expression of serine palmitoyl transferase. However, adiposity was unaffected by LPP3 deficiency on standard, high fat diet or Western diets, although Western diet-fed mice with adipocyte LPP3 deficiency exhibited improved glucose tolerance. Our results demonstrate functional compartmentalization of lipid phosphatase activity in adipocytes and identify an unexpected role for LPP3 in the regulation of diet-dependent sphingolipid synthesis that may impact on insulin signaling."

The aim of this study was to investigate the serum markers osteopontin (OPN), tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 (TNFR1) and 2 (TNFR2) receptor activator of nuclear factor‐kappa B ligand (RANKL) and RANKL/ osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio and compare them in PD and RA groups. Materials & methods RA (with PD = 19 and without PD = 19), PD (n = 38) and 14 healthy subjects underwent bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing pocket depth (PPD) measurement. PD was defined as PPD measuring ≥5mm registered in ≥3 sites. Marginal bone loss (MBL) for premolars and molars was measured on digital panoramic radiographs. Serum samples were collected from all subjects. OPN, TNFR1, TNFR2 and RANKL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). OPG was measured as part of a multiplex proximity extension assay (PEA). Results OPN, TNFR1, TNFR2 and RANKL serum levels were the highest in the RA group with PD, while the RA group without PD were comparable to PD subjects only. The RANKL/OPG ratios were comparable between PD group and both RA groups with (p = 0.051) and without PD (p = 0.37). Serum RANKL levels were associated with MBL (p = 0.008) and PPD ≥ 5mm (p = 0.01). Conclusion Peripheral osteoclastogenesis is a feature of periodontal disease with systemic levels of osteoclastogenic markers comparable to the effects observed in rheumatoid arthritis."

Multiple host and viral factors regulate LTR activity and modulate HIV-1 latency. Manipulation of the HIV-1 LTR provides a potential therapeutic strategy for combating HIV-1 persistence. In this study, we identified an RNA/DNA-binding protein, scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB1), as a host cell factor that represses HIV-1 transcription. We found that SAFB1 bound to the HIV-1 5′ LTR and significantly repressed 5′ LTR–driven viral transcription and HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells. Mechanistically, SAFB1-mediated repression of HIV-1 transcription and infection was independent of its RNA- and DNA-binding capacities. Instead, by binding to phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, SAFB1 blocked its recruitment to the HIV-1 LTR. Of note, SAFB1-mediated repression of HIV-1 transcription from proviral DNA maintained HIV-1 latency in CD4+ T cells.

Increased attention has recently been shifted to SAFB1-mediated RNA binding and protein–protein interactions and functions (12.Norman M. Rivers C. Lee Y.B. Idris J. Uney J.

SAFB1 contains several domains that mediate its crucial function in DNA repair, processing of mRNA, protein–protein interactions, as well as interaction with chromatin-modifying complexes (15.Garee J.P. Oesterreich S. SAFB1's multiple functions in biological control: lots still to be done!.J. Cell.

Its N terminus contains the scaffold attachment factor box (SAF box), which mediates binding to adenine- and thymine-rich S/MARs of DNA elements, downstream of which are the high similarity region, the RNA recognition motif, and a nuclear localization signal. The C terminus contains the glutamate- and arginine-rich region and the Arg/Gly-rich region containing an RGG motif (15.Garee J.P. Oesterreich S.

SAFB1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor that modulates tumorigenesis-related gene expression through association with other host proteins or by binding directly to different gene promoters. For instance, SAFB1 binds and represses estrogen receptor α–mediated trans-activation via indirect association with histone deacetylation and interaction with TATA-box binding protein associated factor 15 (TAF15), a member of the basal transcription machinery (19.Townson S.M. Kang K. Lee A.V. Oesterreich S. Structure-function analysis of the estrogen receptor α corepressor scaffold attachment factor-B1: identification of a potent transcriptional repression domain.J. Biol.

Additionally, SAFB1 also binds to and represses expression of the androgen receptor and androgen receptor–driven transcription, which is thought to be involved in the control of tumorigenesis of prostate cancer (20.Mukhopadhyay N.K. Kim J. You S. Morello M. Hager M.H. Huang W.C. Ramachandran A. Yang J. Cinar B. Rubin M.A. Adam R.M. Oesterreich S. Di Vizio D. Freeman M.R. Scaffold attachment factor B1 regulates the androgen receptor in concert with the growth inhibitory kinase MST1 and the methyltransferase EZH2.Oncogene. 2014; 33 (23893242): 3235-324510.1038/onc.2013.294Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, by forming a complex with other host proteins, X-ray repair cross-complementing 5 (XRCC5) and Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1), SAFB1 binds to the promoter of the human xanthine oxidoreductase (hXOR) gene and restricts its transcription and expression, leading to reduced production of reactive oxygen species and uric acid and control of hXOR-associated diseases, including carcinogenesis (21.Lin J. Xu P. LaVallee P. Hoidal J.R.

Additionally, SAFB1 has been shown to be associated with RNA pol II and a subset of serine/arginine-rich RNA processing proteins (18.Nayler O. Strätling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. SAF-B protein couples transcription and pre-mRNA splicing to SAR/MAR elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26 (9671816): 3542-354910.1093/nar/26.15.3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Through binding to the S/MAR of DNA elements, SAFB1 serves as a molecule base to couple with RNA pol II and serine/arginine-rich RNA processing proteins to assemble into a transcriptome complex in the vicinity of actively transcribed genes for regulating transcription and pre-mRNA splicing (18.Nayler O. Strätling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. SAF-B protein couples transcription and pre-mRNA splicing to SAR/MAR elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26 (9671816): 3542-354910.1093/nar/26.15.3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The SUMOylated SAFB1 has been reported to promote the nuclear processing of pre-mRNA and to stimulate RNA pol II binding to promoters to facilitate transcription initiation (22.Liu H.W. Banerjee T. Guan X. Freitas M.A. Parvin J.D. The chromatin scaffold protein SAFB1 localizes SUMO-1 to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes to facilitate transcription initiation and splicing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25800734): 3605-361310.1093/nar/gkv246Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we report that SAFB1 dramatically repressed HIV-1 infection and 5′ LTR–driven viral transcription through binding to the 5′ LTR region and blocking access of phosphorylated RNA pol II to the LTR, thus repressing HIV-1 transcription from proviral DNA and maintaining HIV-1 latency in T cells. Our findings facilitate a better understanding of host modulation of HIV-1 transcription and latency and might provide a new host target for HIV-1 cure strategies. SAFB1 is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein that participates in regulating multiple cellular transcriptional events (15.Garee J.P. Oesterreich S. SAFB1's multiple functions in biological control: lots still to be done!.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109 (20014070): 312-31910.1002/jcb.22420Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To investigate whether SAFB1 regulates HIV-1 transcription and infection, lentivirus vectors containing SAFB1-specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were used to transduce Jurkat T or HEK293T cells to stably knock down SAFB1 expression (Fig. 1A), and then cells were further infected with a single-cycle infectious HIV-luc/VSV-G virus for 2 days. Viral infection was measured by quantifying the luciferase activity. SAFB1 knockdown significantly increased HIV-1 infection, as demonstrated by a 36- to 58-fold enhancement for viral infection in Jurkat T cells and 12- to 20-fold in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1, B and C). When different amounts of HIV-luc/VSV-G were used to infect Jurkat T cells, SAFB1 stable knockdown resulted in a 21- to 32-fold enhancement of viral infection (Fig. 1D). SAFB1 knockdown did not significantly alter the transcription of other host genes (Fig. S1). To further confirm the inhibitory role of SAFB1, we performed HIV-1 infection in PHA-P–activated primary CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1E). The endogenous SAFB1 in PHA-P–activated primary CD4+ T cells was successfully knocked down by transduction with lentiviruses containing SAFB1-specific shRNA for 3 days (Fig. 1F). The cells were further infected with replication-competent HIVNL4-3 viruses for an additional 5 and 7 days. SAFB1 knockdown increased HIV-1 replication, as demonstrated by more viral particles synthesizing and releasing using anti-p24gag Western blotting and p24gag capture ELISA assays (Fig. 1, F and G). The harvested cell culture supernatants were further titrated in TZM-bl indicator cells, and a significantly increased viral infectivity from the supernatant of SAFB1 knockdown cells was observed (Fig. 1H). shR-SAFB1 treatment did not change the specific infectivity of the virus because viral infectivity (Fig. 1H) and viral production (Fig. 1G) increased in parallel. We also performed a siRNA experiment to specifically interfere with SAFB1 expression in HEK293T cells and demonstrated the inhibitory role of SAFB1 on infection of HIV-luc/VSV-G (Fig. S2A). In addition, we also overexpressed SAFB1 in HEK293T cells by transfection with the SAFB1-expressing plasmid pCDNA3.1-HA/SAFB1 for 24 h and then infected the cells with HIV-luc/VSV-G for an additional 48 h. The results showed that SAFB1 overexpression significantly inhibited HIV-1 infection (Fig. S2B). Knockdown of SAFB1 by using lentiviruses containing SAFB1-specific shRNAs or SAFB1 overexpression in Jurkat cells did not alter cell proliferation (Fig. S3, A and B), which was assessed by using the MTT method as described previously (23.Ren X.X. Wang H.B. Li C. Jiang J.F. Xiong S.D. Jin X. Wu L. Wang J.H. HIV-1 Nef-associated factor 1 enhances viral production by interacting with CRM1 to promote nuclear export of unspliced HIV-1 gag mRNA.J.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that SAFB1 is a negative host factor that inhibits HIV-1 infection. Having demonstrated the inhibitory role of SAFB1 on HIV-1 replication, we next investigated which step of the virus life cycle was blocked. Jurkat cells with SAFB1 stable knockdown were infected with HIV-luc/VSV-G for 24 h, and then cellular DNA and mRNA were isolated. The integrated proviral gag DNA quantified with Alu-PCR showed similar levels in SAFB1 knockdown cells as in cells transfected with an off-target control (Fig. 2A, left panel). When quantified for the production of HIV-1 gag mRNA, SAFB1 knockdown increased the expression of gag mRNA by 10-fold (Fig. 2A, right panel). These data suggest that SAFB1 repressed the transcription of HIV-1 proviral DNA. The initiation and elongation of HIV-1 LTR–driven transcription can be monitored by qPCR with specific primers (5.Zhu J. Gaiha G.D. John S.P. Pertel T. Chin C.R. Gao G. Qu H. Walker B.D. Elledge S.J. Brass A.L. Reactivation of latent HIV-1 by inhibition of BRD4.Cell Rep. 2012; 2 (23041316): 807-81610.1016/j.celrep.2012.09.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). SAFB1 knockdown increased viral mRNAs of all lengths. In particular, elongated viral mRNAs, including proximal, intermediate, and distal transcripts, showed the most substantial elevation, a 6.9- to 10.3-fold increase (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that SAFB1 hinders HIV-1 LTR–driven transcription, particularly the transcriptional elongation step. SAFB1 contains several functional domains that mediate its crucial cellular roles (15.Garee J.P. Oesterreich S. SAFB1's multiple functions in biological control: lots still to be done!.J. Cell. Biochem. 2010; 109 (20014070): 312-31910.1002/jcb.22420Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 16.Drakouli S. Lyberopoulou A. Papathanassiou M. Mylonis I. Georgatsou E.

To investigate which domain is required for SAFB1-mediated HIV-1 inhibition, truncated SAFB1 mutants were constructed (Fig. 3A). HEK293T cells were transfected with truncated or WT SAFB1-expressing plasmids. These truncations did not alter its nucleoplasm location, as observed under a confocal microscope (Fig. 3B). The transfected HEK293T cells were further infected with HIV-luc/VSV-G for an additional 48 h. Deletion of the C-terminal Arg/Gly-rich domain abolished SAFB1's inhibitory role of HIV-1 infection, whereas the other truncated forms did not affect anti-HIV-1 activity (Fig. 3, C and D). These data demonstrate that the Arg/Gly-rich domain is required for SAFB1-mediated HIV-1 inhibition. The RGG motif mediates interactions of SAFB1 with multiple nuclear factors (14.Debril M.B. Dubuquoy L. Feige J.N. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Gelman L. Scaffold attachment factor B1 directly interacts with nuclear receptors in living cells and represses transcriptional activity.J. Mol.

The finding that the deletion of the Arg/Gly-rich domain abolished SAFB1's inhibitory role of HIV-1 infection led us to investigate whether SAFB1-repressed HIV-1 transcription occurred by affecting the functions of other host proteins that are essential for HIV-1 infection. SAFB1 has been reported to be capable of interacting with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II and exist in the RNA pol II transcriptional complex (18.Nayler O. Strätling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. SAF-B protein couples transcription and pre-mRNA splicing to SAR/MAR elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26 (9671816): 3542-354910.1093/nar/26.15.3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24.Melnik S.

Methods. 2011; 8 (21946667): 963-96810.1038/nmeth.1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is possible that SAFB1 represses HIV-1 transcription by modulating RNA pol II function. To investigate this, we first determined the potential of SAFB1 binding with the HIV-1 LTR promoter. The HIV proviral 5′ LTR is organized into three strictly positioned nucleosomes (Nuc-0, Nuc-1, and Nuc-2) separated by two intervening enhancer regions, DNase hypersensitive site 1 (DHS-1) and DHS-2, which provide binding sites for multiple host transcription factors that either positively or negatively regulate transcription (25.Verdin E. Paras Jr, P. Van Lint C. Chromatin disruption in the promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 during transcriptional activation.EMBO J. 1993; 12 (8344262): 3249-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We performed a ChIP analysis in HIV-1–infected Jurkat T cells with anti-SAFB1–specific antibodies and analyzed the products using specific primers targeting the HIV-1 LTR Nuc0, DHS, Nuc1, or Nuc2 regions. We found associations between SAFB1 and the HIV-1 LTR Nuc1 and Nuc2 regions (Fig. 4A). We next performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay in Jurkat T cells to detect the association of SAFB1 with RNA pol II. Specific antibodies against SAFB1, unphosphorylated RNA pol II (8WG16), and phosphorylated RNA pol II at serine 2 of the CTD (pSer-2) were used for immunoprecipitation. SAFB1 showed an association with the phosphorylated (Fig. 4B, bottom panel) but not the unphosphorylated RNA pol II (Fig. 4B, top panel). SAFB1 is known to be a DNA/RNA-binding protein (26.Omura Y. Nishio Y. Takemoto T. Ikeuchi C. Sekine O. Morino K. Maeno Y. Obata T. Ugi S. Maegawa H. Kimura H. Kashiwagi A. SAFB1, an RBMX-binding protein, is a newly identified regulator of hepatic SREBP-1c gene.BMB Rep. 2009; 42 (19403048): 232-23710.5483/BMBRep.2009.42.4.232Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To prove the direct interaction between SAFB1 and phosphorylated RNA pol II, an extensive nuclease, benzonase, was used to treat the cell lysates to rapidly hydrolyze nucleic acids. The co-immunoprecipitation assay showed a stable association of SAFB1 with the pSer-2 form of RNA pol II despite benzonase treatment (Fig. 4C and Fig. S4). We have demonstrated the binding between SAFB1 and the HIV-1 LTR Nuc1 and Nuc2 regions (Fig. 4A), which are also the sites on LTR regions responsible for binding with phosphorylated RNA pol II. Thus, the association of SAFB1 with phosphorylated RNA pol II might hinder the latter being recruited to HIV-1 LTR regions. Indeed, knockdown of endogenous SAFB1 significantly increased recruitment of pSer-2 RNA pol II to the HIV-1 LTR Nuc-1 and Nuc-2 regions, as shown in the pSer-2 RNA pol II ChIP assay by using HIV-1–infected Jurkat cells (Fig. 4D). Having demonstrated that deletion of the C-terminal Arg/Gly-rich domain abolished SAFB1-mediated HIV-1 inhibition, we then investigated whether deletion of the Arg/Gly-rich domain could affect its association with phosphorylated RNA pol II. The HA-tagged plasmid expressing full-length or Arg/Gly-rich domain-deleted (ΔArg/Gly) SAFB1 was transfected into Jurkat T cells, and then co-immunoprecipitation of SAFB1 or its mutant with the endogenous phosphorylated RNA pol II was performed. Deletion of the Arg/Gly-rich domain impaired the association of SAFB1 with the pSer-2 RNA pol II (Fig. 4E). As expected, SAFB1-ΔArg/Gly was unable to inhibit HIV-1 infection of Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that SAFB1 associates with phosphorylated RNA pol II to impede its recruitment to the LTR. HIV-1 latency is characterized mainly by reversible silencing of LTR-driven transcription of an integrated provirus (1.Margolis D.M. Mechanisms of HIV latency: an emerging picture of complexity.Curr.

The inhibitory effect of SAFB1 on HIV-1 transcription suggests a potential role for SAFB1 in HIV-1 latency. Thus, we sought to investigate the effect of endogenous SAFB1 on the expression of an integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA in CD4+ T cells. A latently HIV-1–infected Jurkat T cell clone (C11) harboring an HIV-1 proviral DNA encoding GFP was used (29.Qu X. Wang P. Ding D. Li L. Wang H. Ma L. Zhou X. Liu S. Lin S. Wang X. Zhang G. Liu S.

These cells can be reactivated upon stimulation with TNFα, vorinostat, or trichostatin A to express GFP as an indication of HIV-1 reactivation from latency (29.Qu X. Wang P. Ding D. Li L. Wang H.

The endogenous SAFB1 in C11 cells was successfully knocked down by using specific shRNA (Fig. 5A). SAFB1 knockdown increased HIV-1 reactivation despite the presence or absence of stimulation with TNFα (Fig. 5B). To confirm that the observed effect of SAFB1 on HIV-1 gene expression is not an artifact in a single cell line, we performed the same experiment in the latently HIV-1-infected CEM cell clone ACH2, which contains a single copy of proviral DNA per cell (31.O'Brien M.C. Ueno T. Jahan N. Zajac-Kaye M. Mitsuya H. HIV-1 expression induced by anti-cancer agents in latently HIV-1-infected ACH2 cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W2807150266,"The discovery that MptpA (low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase A) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has an essential role for Mtb virulence has motivated research of tyrosine-specific phosphorylation in Mtb and other pathogenic bacteria. The phosphatase activity of MptpA is regulated via phosphorylation on Tyr128 and Tyr129 Thus far, only a single tyrosine-specific kinase, protein-tyrosine kinase A (PtkA), encoded by the Rv2232 gene has been identified within the Mtb genome. MptpA undergoes phosphorylation by PtkA. PtkA is an atypical bacterial tyrosine kinase, as its sequence differs from the sequence consensus within this family. The lack of structural information on PtkA hampers the detailed characterization of the MptpA-PtkA interaction. Here, using NMR spectroscopy, we provide a detailed structural characterization of the PtkA architecture and describe its intra- and intermolecular interactions with MptpA. We found that PtkA's domain architecture differs from the conventional kinase architecture and is composed of two domains, the N-terminal highly flexible intrinsically disordered domain (IDDPtkA) and the C-terminal rigid kinase core domain (KCDPtkA). The interaction between the two domains, together with the structural model of the complex proposed in this study, reveal that the IDDPtkA is unstructured and highly dynamic, allowing for a ""fly-casting-like"" mechanism of transient interactions with the rigid KCDPtkA This interaction modulates the accessibility of the KCDPtkA active site. In general, the structural and functional knowledge of PtkA gained in this study is crucial for understanding the MptpA-PtkA interactions, the catalytic mechanism, and the role of the kinase-phosphatase regulatory system in Mtb virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2805849565,"When given privileged information of an object's true location, adults often overestimate the likelihood that a protagonist holding a false belief will search in the correct location for that object. This type of egocentric bias is often labelled the 'curse of knowledge'. Interestingly, the magnitude of this bias may be modulated by the social distance between the perspective taker and target. However, this social distance effect has yet to be fully demonstrated when adults reason about false beliefs. Using a continuous false belief task, we investigated i) whether adults were biased by their own knowledge when reasoning about another's false belief, ii) whether the magnitude of this egocentric bias was modulated by social distance, and iii) whether this social distance effect extended to a heterospecific out-group, namely a dog. To test these hypotheses we conducted three experiments. In Experiment 1 (N = 283), we used an established continuous false belief task, in Experiment 2 (N = 281) we modified this task, and Experiment 3 (N = 744) was a direct replication of Experiment 2. Across these experiments, the curse of knowledge effect was reliably replicated when adults mentalised about an in-group protagonist, and replicated in two of the three studies (Experiments 1 and 3) when adults mentalised about out-group protagonists. In an internal-meta analysis, the curse of knowledge effect was present across all conditions, and there was no effect of social distance. Hence, overall these data are not consistent with the hypothesis that social distance modulates adults' egocentric biases when reasoning about false beliefs. The finding that egocentric biases of a similar magnitude were observed when adults mentalised about an in-group protagonist and a dog suggests that interpersonal dissimilarity is not in itself sufficient to reduce egocentric bias when reasoning about false beliefs."

While most investigation of stress-effects on behavior follows chronic exposures, less is understood about acute exposures and potential after-effects. We examined walking activity in Drosophila following acute exposure to high temperature or electric shock. Compared to initial walking activity, flies first increase walking with exposure to high temperatures then have a strong reduction in activity. These effects are related to the intensity of the high temperature and number of exposures. The reduction in walking activity following high temperature and electric shock exposures survives context changes and lasts at least five hours. Reduction in the function of the biogenic amines octopamine / tyramine and serotonin both strongly blunt the increase in locomotor activity with high temperature exposure. However, neither set of biogenic amines alter the long lasting depression in walking activity after exposure."

Increases in glucose stimulate V-ATPase assembly and activity, and glucose deprivation triggers rapid V-ATPase disassembly and inactivation in yeast. McGuire and Forgac describe the opposite phenomenon in mammalian cells, specifically that V-ATPase assembly and activation increases when glucose is lost, raising new questions about mammalian mechanisms of energy conservation.

Glucose starvation increases V-ATPase assembly and activity in mammalian cells through AMP kinase and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt signalingJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 293Issue 23PreviewThe vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-driven proton pump involved in many cellular processes. An important mechanism by which V-ATPase activity is controlled is the reversible assembly of its two domains, namely the peripheral V1 domain and the integral V0 domain. Although reversible assembly is conserved across all eukaryotic organisms, the signaling pathways controlling it have not been fully characterized. Here, we identify glucose starvation as a novel regulator of V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells. Full-Text PDF Open Access"
https://openalex.org/W2806625890,"Transient receptor potential mucolipin subfamily 1 (TRPML1) is a nonselective cation channel mainly located in late endosomes and lysosomes. Mutations of the gene encoding human TRPML1 can cause severe lysosomal diseases. The activity of TRPML1 is regulated by both Ca2+ and H+, which are important for its critical physiological functions in membrane trafficking, exocytosis, autophagy, and intracellular signal transduction. However, the molecular mechanism of its dual regulation by Ca2+ and H+ remains elusive. Here, using a mutant screening method in combination with a whole-cell patch clamp technique, we identified a key TRPML1 residue, Asp-472, responsible for both fast calcium-dependent inactivation (FCDI) and slow calcium-dependent inactivation (SCDI) as well as H+ regulation. We also found that, in acidic pH, H+ can significantly delay FCDI and abolish SCDI and thereby presumably facilitate the ion conductance of the human TRPML1 channel. In summary, we have identified a key residue critical for Ca2+-induced inhibition of TRPML1 channel currents and uncovered pH-dependent regulation of this channel, providing vital information regarding the detailed mechanism of action of human TRPML1."

Data confirm that school fees act as an impediment to educational attainment, and in very rural poor settings such as northern Benin, students often depend on extended family and kinship networks to pay fees. But existing remittance options are costly, in terms of fees, time, and risk. We pilot a new technology bundle in a single public high school in northeastern Benin, and evaluate its effectiveness. Here we describe the technical and institutional implementation of the project, as well as our findings from the first year of operation. We discuss takeaways and implications for scale-up."
https://openalex.org/W2808492946,"Background While controversies on limitation of coverage by the national health insurance and relatively high direct or “out-of-pocket” household payments by the national health insurance in South Korea still remain, potential unfavorable influence of the insufficiency of the universal health coverage on depression has not yet been evaluated. Methods and findings Baseline information were obtained from a community cohort (The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study) of middle-aged subjects without depression at enrollment period (2001–2002). Subjects were followed-up biennially, and new onset depression was assessed using Becks Depression Inventory at 2nd round follow-up (2005–2006). Influence of direct medical expenditure on depression onset was investigated in all subjects and in stratified groups of different income level. Increasing risk of depression onset was observed for increased medical expenditure (OR [95% CI];1.44 [0.97–2.13], 1.90 [1.19–3.05], 1.71 [1.01–2.91] for spending <50000 KRW, 50000–100000 KRW, and ≥100000 KRW, respectively, vs. almost no expenditure per month; P for trend = 0.012), after adjusting for covariates such as monthly income and chronic disease history. Similar associations were observed in subjects less than or at average national income, but results were not significant in subgroup with monthly income above national average. Conclusions Even with the universal coverage, high co-payments and uninsured services in the Korean health insurance system yet possibly make the insured pay much for medical service utilization. This might have led to onset of an unfavorable health condition such as depression."
