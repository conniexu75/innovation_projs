https://openalex.org/W1491048006,"Recent player tracking technology provides new information about basketball game performance. The aim of this study was to (i) compare the game performances of all-star and non all-star basketball players from the National Basketball Association (NBA), and (ii) describe the different basketball game performance profiles based on the different game roles. Archival data were obtained from all 2013-2014 regular season games (n = 1230). The variables analyzed included the points per game, minutes played and the game actions recorded by the player tracking system. To accomplish the first aim, the performance per minute of play was analyzed using a descriptive discriminant analysis to identify which variables best predict the all-star and non all-star playing categories. The all-star players showed slower velocities in defense and performed better in elbow touches, defensive rebounds, close touches, close points and pull-up points, possibly due to optimized attention processes that are key for perceiving the required appropriate environmental information. The second aim was addressed using a k-means cluster analysis, with the aim of creating maximal different performance profile groupings. Afterwards, a descriptive discriminant analysis identified which variables best predict the different playing clusters. The results identified different playing profile of performers, particularly related to the game roles of scoring, passing, defensive and all-round game behavior. Coaching staffs may apply this information to different players, while accounting for individual differences and functional variability, to optimize practice planning and, consequently, the game performances of individuals and teams."
https://openalex.org/W1605596072,"Iron availability directly affects photosynthesis and limits phytoplankton growth over vast oceanic regions. For this reason, the availability of iron is a crucial variable to consider in the development of active chlorophyll a fluorescence based estimates of phytoplankton primary productivity. These bio-optical approaches require a conversion factor to derive ecologically-relevant rates of CO2-assimilation from estimates of electron transport in photosystem II. The required conversion factor varies significantly across phytoplankton taxa and environmental conditions, but little information is available on its response to iron limitation. In this study, we examine the role of iron limitation, and the interacting effects of iron and light availability, on the coupling of photosynthetic electron transport and CO2-assimilation in marine phytoplankton. Our results show that excess irradiance causes increased decoupling of carbon fixation and electron transport, particularly under iron limiting conditions. We observed that reaction center II specific rates of electron transport (ETR(RCII), mol e- mol RCII(-1) s(-1)) increased under iron limitation, and we propose a simple conceptual model for this observation. We also observed a strong correlation between the derived conversion factor and the expression of non-photochemical quenching. Utilizing a dataset from in situ phytoplankton assemblages across a coastal--oceanic transect in the Northeast subarctic Pacific, this relationship was used to predict ETR(RCII): CO2-assimilation conversion factors and carbon-based primary productivity from FRRF data, without the need for any additional measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2163023134,"Internet addiction (IA) has increasingly been recognized as a serious psychological malady among college students. Impulsivity has been shown to be associated to addictive behaviors, also to IA, and that the purpose of the study is to investigate whether or not there are variables modulating the relation between impulsivity and IA. ""Meaning in life"" is regarded as a desirable attribute, with positive mental health outcomes. ""Self-esteem"" is often regarded as an important component of psychological health which has relation to IA. Therefore, we examined meaning in life and self-esteem's possible effects in this relationship. A total of 1068 Chinese college students ranging in age from 18 to 25 years were recruited for this cross-sectional survey study. Correlations and multivariate regressions were used to calculate the possible mediation and moderation relationship among the variables of meaning in life, self-esteem, impulsivity, and IA. In the analyses that we conducted, IA was shown to be prevalent among Chinese university students. The relationship between impulsivity and IA was partially mediated by meaning in life, and the relationship between meaning in life and IA was moderated by self-esteem. Our findings demonstrate that meaning in life and self-esteem can be useful buffers to IA for highly impulsive individuals. Further randomized trials to confirm these results are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1510199949,"The cell division cycle associated 8 (CDCA8) gene plays an important role in mitosis. Overexpression of CDCA8 was reported in some human cancers and is required for cancer growth and progression. We found CDCA8 expression was also high in human ES cells (hESCs) but dropped significantly upon hESC differentiation. However, the regulation of CDCA8 expression has not yet been studied. Here, we characterized the CDCA8 promoter and identified its cis-elements and transcription factors. Three transcription start sites were identified. Reporter gene assays revealed that the CDCA8 promoter was activated in hESCs and cancer cell lines. The promoter drove the reporter expression specifically to pluripotent cells during early mouse embryo development and to tumor tissues in tumor-bearing mice. These results indicate that CDCA8 is transcriptionally activated in hESCs and cancer cells. Mechanistically, two key activation elements, bound by transcription factor NF-Y and CREB1, respectively, were identified in the CDCA8 basic promoter by mutation analyses and electrophoretic motility shift assays. NF-Y binding is positively correlated with promoter activities in different cell types. Interestingly, the NF-YA subunit, binding to the promoter, is primarily a short isoform in hESCs and a long isoform in cancer cells, indicating a different activation mechanism of the CDCA8 transcription between hESCs and cancer cells. Finally, enhanced CDCA8 promoter activities by NF-Y overexpression and reduced CDCA8 transcription by NF-Y knockdown further verified that NF-Y is a positive regulator of CDCA8 transcription. Our study unearths the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of CDCA8 expression in hESCs and cancer cells, which provides a better understanding of its biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W1590347389,"Although the accumulation of a misfolded and protease-resistant form of the prion protein (PrP) is a key event in prion pathogenesis, the cellular factors involved in its folding and quality control are poorly understood. PrP is a glycosylated and disulfide-bonded protein synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER foldase ERp57 (also known as Grp58) is highly expressed in the brain of sporadic and infectious forms of prion-related disorders. ERp57 is a disulfide isomerase involved in the folding of a subset of glycoproteins in the ER as part of the calnexin/calreticulin cycle. Here, we show that levels of ERp57 increase mainly in neurons of Creutzfeldt-Jacob patients. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in cell culture, we demonstrate that ERp57 expression controls the maturation and total levels of wild-type PrP and mutant forms associated with human disease. In addition, we found that PrP physically interacts with ERp57, and also with the closest family member PDIA1, but not ERp72. Furthermore, we generated a conditional knock-out mouse for ERp57 in the nervous system and detected a reduction in the steady-state levels of the mono- and nonglycosylated forms of PrP in the brain. In contrast, ERp57 transgenic mice showed increased levels of endogenous PrP. Unexpectedly, ERp57 expression did not affect the susceptibility of cells to ER stress in vitro and in vivo. This study identifies ERp57 as a new modulator of PrP levels and may help with understanding the consequences of ERp57 up-regulation observed in human disease.

However, the precise role of Cav-3 in the regulation of local Ca2+ signaling in pathological cardiac hypertrophy is unclear. We used cardiac-specific Cav-3-overexpressing mice and in vivo and in vitro cardiac hypertrophy models to determine the essential requirement for Cav-3 expression in protection against pharmacologically and pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Transverse aortic constriction and angiotensin-II (Ang-II) infusion in wild type (WT) mice resulted in cardiac hypertrophy characterized by significant reduction in fractional shortening, ejection fraction, and a reduced expression of Cav-3. In addition, association of PKCα and angiotensin-II receptor, type 1, with Cav-3 was disrupted in the hypertrophic ventricular myocytes. Whole cell patch clamp analysis demonstrated increased expression of T-type Ca2+ current (ICa, T) in hypertrophic ventricular myocytes. In contrast, the Cav-3-overexpressing mice demonstrated protection from transverse aortic constriction or Ang-II-induced pathological hypertrophy with inhibition of ICa, T and intact Cav-3-associated macromolecular signaling complexes. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Cav-3 in the neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in enhanced Ang-II stimulation of ICa, T mediated by PKCα, which caused nuclear translocation of NFAT. Overexpression of Cav-3 in neonatal myocytes prevented a PKCα-mediated increase in ICa, T and nuclear translocation of NFAT. In conclusion, we show that stable Cav-3 expression is essential for protecting the signaling mechanisms in pharmacologically and pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

https://openalex.org/W928008457,"Introduction To improve our understanding of sex differences in the clinical characteristics of Parkinson’s Disease, we sought to examine differences in the clinical features and disease severity of men and women with early treated Parkinson’s Disease (PD) enrolled in a large-scale clinical trial. Methods Analysis was performed of baseline data from the National Institutes of Health Exploratory Trials in Parkinson’s Disease (NET-PD) Long-term Study-1, a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 10 grams of oral creatine/day in individuals with early, treated PD. We compared mean age at symptom onset, age at PD diagnosis, and age at randomization between men and women using t-test statistics. Sex differences in clinical features were evaluated, including: symptoms at diagnosis (motor) and symptoms at randomization (motor, non-motor, and daily functioning). Results 1,741 participants were enrolled (62.5% male). No differences were detected in mean age at PD onset, age at PD diagnosis, age at randomization, motor symptoms, or daily functioning between men and women. Differences in non-motor symptoms were observed, with women demonstrating better performance compared to men on SCOPA-COG (Z = 5.064, p<0.0001) and Symbol Digit Modality measures (Z = 5.221, p<0.0001). Conclusions Overall, men and women did not demonstrate differences in clinical motor features early in the course of PD. However, the differences observed in non-motor cognitive symptoms suggests further assessment of the influence of sex on non-motor symptoms in later stages of PD is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W889344132,"Purpose To investigate the association of genetic and environmental factors, and their interactions in Korean patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods A total of 314 robustly characterized exudative AMD patients, including 111 PCV (polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) and 154 typical choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and 395 control subjects without any evidence of AMD were enrolled. Full ophthalmologic examinations including fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICG) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were done, according to which patients were divided into either PCV or typical CNV. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information regarding underlying systemic diseases, dietary habits, smoking history and body mass index (BMI). A total of 86 SNPs from 31 candidate genes were analyzed. Genotype association and logistic regression analyses were done and stepwise regression models to best predict disease for each AMD subtype were constructed. Results Age, spherical equivalent, myopia, and ever smoking were associated with exudative AMD. Age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, spherical equivalent, and myopia were risk factors for typical CNV, while increased education and ever smoking were significantly associated with PCV (p<.05 for all). Four SNPs, ARMS2/HTRA1 rs10490924, rs11200638, and rs2736911, and CFH rs800292, showed association with exudative AMD. Two of these SNPs, ARMS2/HTRA1 rs10490924 and rs11200638, showed significant association with typical CNV and PCV specifically. There were no significant interactions between environmental and genetic factors. The most predictive disease model for exudative AMD included age, spherical equivalent, smoking, CFH rs800292, and ARMS2 rs10490924 while that for typical CNV included age, hyperlipidemia, spherical equivalent, and ARMS2 rs10490924. Smoking, spherical equivalent, and ARMS2 rs10490924 were the most predictive variables for PCV. When comparing PCV cases to CNV cases, age, BMI, and education were the most predictive risk factors of PCV. Conclusions Only one locus, the ARMS2/HTRA1 was a significant genetic risk factor for Korean exudative AMD, including its subtypes, PCV and typical CNV. Stepwise regression revealed that CFH was important to risk of exudative AMD in general but not to any specific subtype. While increased education was a unique risk factor to PCV when compared to CNV, this association was independent of refractive error in this homogenous population from South Korea. No significant interactions between environmental and genetic risk factors were observed."
https://openalex.org/W1610395261,"Oral toxicity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) specific to integrin β1 subunit (SeINT) was known in a polyphagous insect pest, Spodoptera exigua. For an application of the dsRNA to control the insect pest, this study prepared a transformed Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA specific to SeINT.The dsRNA expression was driven by T7 RNA polymerase overexpressed by an inducer in the transformed E. coli. The produced dsRNA amount was proportional to the number of the cultured bacteria. The transformed bacteria gave a significant oral toxicity to S. exigua larvae with a significant reduction of the SeINT expression. The resulting insect mortality increased with the fed number of the bacteria. Pretreatment with an ultra-sonication to disrupt bacterial cell wall/membrane significantly increased the insecticidal activity of the transformed bacteria. The larvae treated with the transformed bacteria suffered tissue damage in the midgut epithelium, which exhibited a marked loss of cell-cell contacts and underwent a remarkable cell death. Moreover, these treated larvae became significantly susceptible to a Cry toxin derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).This study provides a novel and highly efficient application technique to use dsRNA specific to an integrin gene by mixing with a biopesticide, Bt."
https://openalex.org/W1491632178,"Studies examining hormones throughout pregnancy and lactation in women have been limited to single, or a few repeated, short-term measures of endocrine activity. Furthermore, potential differences in chronic hormonal changes across pregnancy/lactation between first-time and experienced mothers are not well understood, especially as they relate to infant development. Hormone concentrations in hair provide long-term assessments of hormone production, and studying these measures in non-human primates allows for repeated sampling under controlled conditions that are difficult to achieve in humans. We studied hormonal profiles in the hair of 26 female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, n=12 primiparous), to determine the influences of parity on chronic levels of cortisol (hair cortisol concentration, HCC) and progesterone (hair progesterone concentration, HPC) during early- to mid-pregnancy (PREG1), in late pregnancy/early lactation (PREG2/LACT1), and in peak lactation (LACT2). We also assessed infants’ neurobehavioral development across the first month of life. After controlling for age and stage of pregnancy at the first hair sampling period, we found that HCCs overall peaked in PREG2/LACT1 (p=0.02), but only in primiparous monkeys (p<0.001). HPCs declined across pregnancy and lactation for all monkeys (p<0.01), and primiparous monkeys had higher HPCs overall than multiparous monkeys (p=0.02). Infants of primiparous mothers had lower sensorimotor reflex scores (p=0.02) and tended to be more irritable (p=0.05) and less consolable (p=0.08) in the first month of life. Moreover, across all subjects, HCCs in PREG2/LACT1 were positively correlated with irritability (r(s)=0.43, p=0.03) and negatively correlated with sensorimotor scores (r(s)=-0.41, p=0.04). Together, the present results indicate that primiparity influences both chronic maternal hormonal profiles and infant development. These effects may, in part, reflect differential reproductive and maternal effort in mothers with varied caretaking experience. In addition, infant exposure to relatively higher levels of maternal cortisol during the late fetal and early postnatal periods is predictive of poorer developmental outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1674259799,"Glycogen expressed by the lower genital tract epithelium is believed to support Lactobacillus growth in vivo, although most genital isolates of Lactobacillus are not able to use glycogen as an energy source in vitro. We recently reported that α-amylase is present in the genital fluid of women and that it breaks down glycogen into small carbohydrates that support growth of lactobacilli. Since the pH of the lower genital tract can be very low, we determined how low pH affects glycogen processing by α-amylase. α-amylase in saliva degraded glycogen similarly at pH 6 and 7, but activity was reduced by 52% at pH 4. The glycogen degrading activity in nine genital samples from seven women showed a similar profile with an average reduction of more than 50% at pH 4. However, two samples collected from one woman at different times had a strikingly different pH profile with increased glycogen degradation at pH 4, 5 and 6 compared to pH 7. This second pH profile did not correlate with levels of human α-acid glucosidase or human intestinal maltase glucoamylase. High-performance anion-exchange chromatography showed that mostly maltose was produced from glycogen by samples with the second pH profile in contrast to genital α-amylase that yielded maltose, maltotriose and maltotetraose. These studies show that at low pH, α-amylase activity is reduced to low but detectable levels, which we speculate helps maintain Lactobacillus growth at a limited but sustained rate. Additionally, some women have a genital enzyme distinct from α-amylase with higher activity at low pH. Further studies are needed to determine the identity and distribution of this second enzyme, and whether its presence influences the makeup of genital microbiota."

Cellular DNA damage response by the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is mediated mainly by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). The XPC-RAD23B complex is one of the key factors of nucleotide excision repair participating in the primary DNA damage recognition. By using several biochemical approaches, we have analyzed the influence of PARP1 and PAR synthesis on the interaction of XPC-RAD23B with damaged DNA. Free PAR binds to XPC-RAD23B with an affinity that depends on the length of the poly(ADP-ribose) strand and competes with DNA for protein binding. Using 32P-labeled NAD+ and immunoblotting, we also demonstrate that both subunits of the XPC-RAD23B are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP1. The efficiency of XPC-RAD23B PARylation depends on DNA structure and increases after UV irradiation of DNA. Therefore, our study clearly shows that XPC-RAD23B is a target of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation catalyzed by PARP1, which can be regarded as a universal regulator of DNA repair processes.

https://openalex.org/W1925777748,"Previous studies reported the reconstitution of an Mlh1-Pms1-independent 5′ nick-directed mismatch repair (MMR) reaction using Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins. Here we describe the reconstitution of a mispair-dependent Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease activation reaction requiring Msh2-Msh6 (or Msh2-Msh3), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and replication factor C (RFC) and a reconstituted Mlh1-Pms1-dependent 3′ nick-directed MMR reaction requiring Msh2-Msh6 (or Msh2-Msh3), exonuclease 1 (Exo1), replication protein A (RPA), RFC, PCNA, and DNA polymerase δ. Both reactions required Mg2+ and Mn2+ for optimal activity. The MMR reaction also required two reaction stages in which the first stage required incubation of Mlh1-Pms1 with substrate DNA, with or without Msh2-Msh6 (or Msh2-Msh3), PCNA, and RFC but did not require nicking of the substrate, followed by a second stage in which other proteins were added. Analysis of different mutant proteins demonstrated that both reactions required a functional Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease active site, as well as mispair recognition and Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment by Msh2-Msh6 but not sliding clamp formation. Mutant Mlh1-Pms1 and PCNA proteins that were defective for Exo1-independent but not Exo1-dependent MMR in vivo were partially defective in the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease and MMR reactions, suggesting that both reactions reflect the activation of Mlh1-Pms1 seen in Exo1-independent MMR in vivo. The availability of this reconstituted MMR reaction should now make it possible to better study both Exo1-independent and Exo1-dependent MMR."

Causality was assessed using the WHO-Uppsala Monitoring Centre system. The patient population was classified into three age groups. We analyzed 31,398 (74.9%) ADRs from 9,705 patients, identified as having a causal relationship, from a total pool of 41,930 ADRs from 9,873 patients. Median patient age was 58.0 years; 66.9% were female.Gastrointestinal system (34.4%), nervous system (14.4%), and psychiatric (12.1%) disorders were the most frequent symptoms. Prevalent causative drugs were those for acid-related disorders (11.4%), anti-inflammatory products (10.5%), analgesics (7.2%), and antibacterials (7.1%). Comparisons by age revealed diarrhea and antibacterials to be most commonly associated with ADRs in children (p < 0.001), whereas dizziness was prevalent in the elderly (p < 0.001). Anaphylactic reaction was the most frequent serious event (19.7%), mainly associated with cephalosporins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Among 612 ADRs caused by nonprescription drugs, the leading symptoms and causative drugs were skin disorders (29.6%) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (16.2%), respectively.According to the community pharmacist reports, the leading clinical manifestations and causative drugs associated with ADRs in outpatients differed among age groups."
https://openalex.org/W1549395505,"Mesoscale eddies in the subtropical oligotrophic ocean are ubiquitous and play an important role in nutrient supply and oceanic primary production. However, it is still unclear whether these mesoscale eddies can efficiently transfer CO2 from the atmosphere to deep waters via biological pump because of the sampling difficulty due to their transient nature. In 2007, particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes, measured below the euphotic zone at the edge of warm eddy were 136-194 mg-C m-2 d-1 which was greatly elevated over that (POC flux = 26-35 mg-C m-2 d-1) determined in the nutrient-depleted oligotrophic waters in the Western North Pacific (WNP). In 2010, higher POC fluxes (83-115 mg-C m-2 d-1) were also observed at the boundary of mesoscale eddies in the WNP. The enhanced POC flux at the edge of eddies was mainly attributed to both large denuded diatom frustules and zooplankton fecal pellets based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination. The result suggests that mesoscale eddies in the oligotrophic waters in the subtropical WNP can efficiently increase the oceanic carbon export flux and the eddy edge is a crucial conduit in carbon sequestration to deep waters."
https://openalex.org/W1550105429,"Background Juvenile hormone (JH) plays an important role in honeybee development and the regulation of age-related division of labor. However, honeybees can be exposed to insect growth regulators (IGRs), such as JH analogs developed for insect pest and vector control. Although their side effects as endocrine disruptors on honeybee larval or adult stages have been studied, little is known about the subsequent effects on adults of a sublethal larval exposure. We therefore studied the impact of the JH analog pyriproxyfen on larvae and resulting adults within a colony under semi-field conditions by combining recent laboratory larval tests with chemical analysis and behavioral observations. Oral and chronic larval exposure at cumulative doses of 23 or 57 ng per larva were tested. Results Pyriproxyfen-treated bees emerged earlier than control bees and the highest dose led to a significant rate of malformed adults (atrophied wings). Young pyriproxyfen-treated bees were more frequently rejected by nestmates from the colony, inducing a shorter life span. This could be linked to differences in cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles between control and pyriproxyfen-treated bees. Finally, pyriproxyfen-treated bees exhibited fewer social behaviors (ventilation, brood care, contacts with nestmates or food stocks) than control bees. Conclusion Larval exposure to sublethal doses of pyriproxyfen affected several life history traits of the honeybees. Our results especially showed changes in social integration (acceptance by nestmates and social behaviors performance) that could potentially affect population growth and balance of the colony."

Information on participants' socio-demographic profile (age sex, residential area, number of meals taken per day), sexual practices (vagina, oral and anal sex; heterosexual and homosexual sex; sex with spouse, casual acquaintances, boy/girlfriend and commercial sex workers), sexual behavior (age of sexual debut, use of condom, multiple sex partners, transactional sex and age of sexual partner), and other HIV risk factors (use of alcohol and psychoactive substances, reason for sexual debut, knowledge of HIV prevention and HIV transmission, report of STI symptoms) were collected through an interviewer administered questionnaire. Differences in sexual behavior and sexual practices of adolescents and HIV risk profile of adolescents and young persons resident in urban and rural areas were determined.More than half (53.5%) of the respondents were sexually active, with more residing in the rural than urban areas (64.9% vs 44.1%; p<0.001) and more resident in the rural area reporting having more than one sexual partner (29.5% vs 20.4%; p = 0.04). Also, 97.3% of sexually active respondents reported having vaginal sex, 8.7% reported oral sex and 1.9% reported anal sex.

https://openalex.org/W1931083084,"Export of cell surface pilins in Gram-positive bacteria likely occurs by the translocation of unfolded precursor polypeptides; however, how the unfolded pilins gain their native conformation is presently unknown. Here, we present physiological studies to demonstrate that the FimA pilin of Actinomyces oris contains two disulfide bonds. Alanine substitution of cysteine residues forming the C-terminal disulfide bridge abrogates pilus assembly, in turn eliminating biofilm formation and polymicrobial interaction. Transposon mutagenesis of A. oris yielded a mutant defective in adherence to Streptococcus oralis, and revealed the essential role of a vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) gene in pilus assembly. Targeted deletion of vkor results in the same defects, which are rescued by ectopic expression of VKOR, but not a mutant containing an alanine substitution in its conserved CXXC motif. Depletion of mdbA, which encodes a membrane-bound thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, abrogates pilus assembly and alters cell morphology. Remarkably, overexpression of MdbA or a counterpart from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, rescues the Δvkor mutant. By alkylation assays, we demonstrate that VKOR is required for MdbA reoxidation. Furthermore, crystallographic studies reveal that A. oris MdbA harbors a thioredoxin-like fold with the conserved CXXC active site. Consistently, each MdbA enzyme catalyzes proper disulfide bond formation within FimA in vitro that requires the catalytic CXXC motif. Because the majority of signal peptide-containing proteins encoded by A. oris possess multiple Cys residues, we propose that MdbA and VKOR constitute a major folding machine for the secretome of this organism. This oxidative protein folding pathway may be a common feature in Actinobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1417864101,"Insecticide-treated nets are the cornerstone of global malaria control and have been shown to reduce malaria morbidity by 50-60%. However, some areas are experiencing a resurgence in malaria following successful control. We describe an efficacy decay framework to understand why high malaria burden persists even under high ITN coverage in a community in western Kenya.We enrolled 442 children hospitalized with malaria and paired them with age, time, village and gender-matched controls. We completed comprehensive household and neighborhood assessments including entomological surveillance. The indicators are grouped into five domains in an efficacy decay framework: ITN ownership, compliance, physical integrity, vector susceptibility and facilitating factors. After variable selection, case-control data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression models and mosquito data were analyzed using negative binomial regression. Predictive margins were calculated from logistic regression models.Measures of ITN coverage and physical integrity were not correlated with hospitalized malaria in our study. However, consistent ITN use (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 0.23, 95%CI: 0.12-0.43), presence of nearby larval sites (AOR = 1.137, 95%CI: 1.02-1.27), and specific types of crops (AOR (grains) = 0.446, 95%CI: 0.24-0.82) were significantly correlated with malaria amongst children who owned an ITN. The odds of hospitalization for febrile malaria nearly tripled when one other household member had symptomatic malaria infection (AOR-2.76, 95%CI:1.83-4.18). Overall, perfect household adherence could reduce the probability of hospitalization for malaria to less than 30% (95%CI:0.12-0.46) and adjusting environmental factors such as elimination of larval sites and growing grains nearby could reduce the probability of hospitalization for malaria to less than 20% (95%CI:0.04-0.31).Availability of ITNs is not the bottleneck for malaria prevention in this community. Behavior change interventions to improve compliance and environmental management of mosquito breeding habitats may greatly enhance ITN efficacy. A better understanding of the relationship between agriculture and mosquito survival and feeding success is needed."
https://openalex.org/W928371315,"The gene product of SPINT 2, that encodes a transmembrane, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor independently designated as HAI-2 or placenta bikunin (PB), is involved in regulation of sodium absorption in human gastrointestinal track. Here, we show that SPINT 2 is expressed as two species of different size (30-40- versus 25-kDa) due to different N-glycans on Asn-57. The N-glycan on 25-kDa HAI-2 appears to be of the oligomannose type and that on 30-40-kDa HAI-2 to be of complex type with extensive terminal N-acetylglucosamine branching. The two different types of N-glycan differentially mask two epitopes on HAI-2 polypeptide, recognized by two different HAI-2 mAbs. The 30-40-kDa form may be mature HAI-2, and is primarily localized in vesicles/granules. The 25-kDa form is likely immature HAI-2, that remains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the perinuclear regions of mammary epithelial cells. The two different N-glycans could, therefore, represent different maturation stages of N-glycosylation with the 25-kDa likely a precursor of the 30-40-kDa HAI-2, with the ratio of their levels roughly similar among a variety of cells. In breast cancer cells, a significant amount of the 30-40-kDa HAI-2 can translocate to and inhibit matriptase on the cell surface, followed by shedding of the matriptase-HAI-2 complex. The 25-kDa HAI-2 appears to have also exited the ER/Golgi, being localized at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells. While the 25-kDa HAI-2 was also detected at the extracellular face of plasma membrane at very low levels it appears to have no role in matriptase inhibition probably due to its paucity on the cell surface. Our study reveals that N-glycan branching regulates HAI-2 through different subcellular distribution and subsequently access to different target proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1926044864,"The first non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) introduced to the market in Japan was dabigatran in March 2011, and three more NOACs, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, have since become available. Randomized controlled trials of NOACs have revealed that intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurs less frequently with NOACs compared with warfarin. However, the absolute incidence of ICH associated with NOACs has increased with greater use of these anticoagulants, and we wanted to explore the incidence, clinical characteristics, and treatment course of patients with NOACs-associated ICH.We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of symptomatic ICH patients receiving NOACs between March 2011 and September 2014.ICH occurred in 6 patients (5 men, 1 woman; mean ± SD age, 72.8 ± 3.2 years). Mean time to onset was 146.2 ± 111.5 days after starting NOACs. Five patients received rivaroxaban and 1 patient received apixaban. None received dabigatran or edoxaban. Notably, no hematoma expansion was observed within 24 h of onset in the absence of infusion of fresh frozen plasma, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, recombinant activated factor VIIa or hemodialysis. When NOAC therapy was initiated, mean HAS-BLED and PANWARDS scores were 1.5 ± 0.5 and 39.5 ± 7.7, respectively. Mean systolic blood pressure was 137.8 ± 15.9 mmHg within 1 month before spontaneous ICH onset.Six symptomatic ICHs occurred early in NOAC therapy but hematoma volume was small and did not expand in the absence of infusion of reversal agents or hemodialysis. The occurrence of ICH during NOAC therapy is possible even when there is acceptable mean systolic blood pressure control (137.8 ± 15.9 mmHg) and HAS-BLED score ≤ 2. Even stricter blood pressure lowering and control within the acceptable range may be advisable to prevent ICH during NOAC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1574717549,"Calcium disorders are common in both intensive care units and in patients with chronic kidney disease and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is unknown whether calcium abnormalities in unselected emergency department admissions have an impact on in-hospital mortality.This cross-sectional analysis included all admissions to the Emergency Department at the Inselspital Bern, Switzerland from 2010 to 2011. For hyper- and hypocalcaemic patients with a Mann-Whitney U-test, the differences between subgroups divided by age, length of hospital stay, creatinine, sodium, chloride, phosphate, potassium and magnesium were compared. Associations between calcium disorders and 28-day in-hospital mortality were assessed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model.8,270 patients with calcium measurements were included in our study. Overall 264 (3.2%) patients died. 150 patients (6.13%) with hypocalcaemia and 7 patients with hypercalcaemia (6.19%) died, in contrast to 104 normocalcaemic patients (1.82%). In univariate analysis, calcium serum levels were associated with sex, mortality and pre-existing diuretic therapy (all p<0.05). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia were independent risk factors for mortality (HR 2.00 and HR 1.88, respectively; both p<0.01).Both hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia are associated with increased 28-day in-hospital mortality in unselected emergency department admissions."
https://openalex.org/W2244325236,"This study aimed to determine whether lifestyle and psycho-social factors determine changes in body composition over 10 years in a population of black African females with a high prevalence of obesity.Data were collected from 430 women at baseline and 10-year follow-up. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-derived body fat mass and fat free soft tissue mass, and simple anthropometric measures were taken at both time points. Data on physical activity (PA), diet, smoking, and alcohol intake were collected at baseline. Body size dissatisfaction and body size discrepancy were determined at baseline using the feel minus ideal (FID) index and the perceived minus actual weight status discrepancy score (PAD), respectively.All body composition measurements increased over 10 years (p<0.0005). Two distinct groups of overweight/obese females were identified using PAD and FID: one that was content with their body size and one that wished to be leaner. Vigorous PA at baseline was inversely associated with absolute changes in all measures of adiposity. In subjects who underestimated their body size at baseline (74.0% of the study population) changes in total and peripheral levels of body fat were less than in subjects who correctly identified their body size. In the group that underestimated body size, more women wanted to be leaner than in the group who knew their body size (60.1% vs 47.5%, p<0.05).Underestimation of body size is common and is associated with a lower gain in total body adiposity and a prevalent desire to lose weight."
https://openalex.org/W898477062,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, have become increasingly popular in consumer products. However, data on their potential biological effects on marine organisms, especially invertebrates, remain very limited. This proof of principle study reports the chronic sub-lethal toxicity of two coated AgNPs (oleic acid coated AgNPs and polyvinylpyrrolidone coated AgNPs) on marine benthic invertebrate larvae across three phyla (i.e., the barnacle Balanus Amphitrite, the slipper-limpet Crepidula onyx, and the polychaete Hydroides elegans) in terms of growth, development, and metamorphosis. Bioaccumulation and biodistribution of silver were also investigated. Larvae were also exposed to silver nitrate (AgNO3) in parallel to distinguish the toxic effects derived from nano-silver and the aqueous form of silver. The sub-lethal effect of chronic exposure to coated AgNPs resulted in a significant retardation in growth and development, and reduction of larval settlement rate. The larval settlement rate of H. elegans was significantly lower in the coated AgNP treatment than the AgNO3 treatment, suggesting that the toxicity of coated AgNPs might not be solely evoked by the release of silver ions (Ag+) in the test medium. The three species accumulated silver effectively from coated AgNPs as well as AgNO3, and coated AgNPs were observed in the vacuoles of epithelial cell in the digestive tract of C. onyx. Types of surface coatings did not affect the sub-lethal toxicity of AgNPs. This study demonstrated that coated AgNPs exerted toxic effects in a species-specific manner, and their exposure might allow bioaccumulation of silver, and affect growth, development, and settlement of marine invertebrate larvae. This study also highlighted the possibility that coated AgNPs could be taken up through diet and the toxicity of coated AgNPs might be mediated through toxic Ag+ as well as the novel modalities of coated AgNPs."

The UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) protein is the first and only light photoreceptor characterized to date that is specific for UV-B light and it regulates various aspects of plant growth and development in response to UV-B light. Despite its involvement in the control of important plant traits, most studies on UV-B photoreceptors have focused on Arabidopsis and no data on UVR8 function are available for forest trees. In this study, we isolated a homologue of the UV receptor UVR8 of Arabidopsis, PeUVR8, from Populus euphratica (Euphrates poplar) and analyzed its structure and function in detail. The deduced PeUVR8 amino acid sequence contained nine well-conserved regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) repeats and the region 27 amino acids from the C terminus (C27) that interact with COP1 (CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1). Secondary and tertiary structure analysis showed that PeUVR8 shares high similarity with the AtUVR8 protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. Using heterologous expression in Arabidopsis, we showed that PeUVR8 overexpression rescued the uvr8 mutant phenotype. In addition, PeUVR8 overexpression in wild-type background seedlings grown under UV-B light inhibited hypocotyl elongation and enhanced anthocyanin accumulation. Furthermore, we examined the interaction between PeUVR8 and AtCOP1 using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. Our data provide evidence that PeUVR8 plays important roles in the control of photomorphogenesis in planta."
https://openalex.org/W1510335126,"Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in the bugle circularly generate outer root sheath (ORS) through linear proliferation within limited cycles during anagen phases. However, the mechanisms controlling the pace of HFSC proliferation remain unclear. Here we revealed that Foxp1, a transcriptional factor, was dynamically relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of HFSCs in phase transitions from anagen to catagen, coupled with the rise of oxidative stress. Mass spectrum analyses revealed that the S468 phosphorylation of Foxp1 protein was responsive to oxidative stress and affected its nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Foxp1 deficiency in hair follicles led to compromised ROS accrual and increased HFSC proliferation. And more, NAC treatment profoundly elongated the anagen duration and HFSC proliferation in Foxp1-deficient background. Molecularly, Foxp1 augmented ROS levels through suppression of Trx1-mediated reductive function, thereafter imposing the cell cycle arrest by modulating the activity of p19/p53 pathway. Our findings identify a novel role for Foxp1 in controlling HFSC proliferation with cellular dynamic location in response to oxidative stress during hair cycling."
https://openalex.org/W1584446777,"Congenital infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of congenital abnormalities of the central nervous system. Placenta infection by HCMV allows for viral spread to fetus and may result in intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia-like symptoms, or miscarriages. We previously reported that HCMV activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) for its own replication in cytotrophoblasts. Here, we investigated the molecular bases of PPARγ activation in infected cytotrophoblasts.We show that onboarded cPLA2 carried by HCMV particles is required for effective PPARγ activation in infected HIPEC cytotrophoblasts, and for the resulting inhibition of cell migration. Natural PPARγ agonists are generated by PLA2 driven oxidization of linoleic and arachidonic acids. Therefore, using HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry, we disclosed that cellular and secreted levels of 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) were significantly increased in and from HIPEC cytotrophoblasts at soon as 6 hours post infection. 13-HODE treatment of uninfected HIPEC recapitulated the effect of infection (PPARγ activation, migration impairment). We found that infection of histocultures of normal, first-term, human placental explants resulted in significantly increased levels of secreted 15-HETE and 13-HODE.Our findings reveal that 15-HETE and 13-HODE could be new pathogenic effectors of HCMV congenital infection They provide a new insight about the pathogenesis of congenital infection by HCMV."
https://openalex.org/W879049602,"Background Stage A heart failure (HF) is defined as people without HF symptoms or structural heart disease, but with predisposing conditions for HF. This classification is used to identify high risk patients to prevent progression to symptomatic HF. While guidelines exist for managing HF risk factors, achievement of treatment goals in the United States (US) population is unknown. Methods We examined all adults with Stage A HF (≥20 years, N =4,470) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 2007-2010, a nationally representative sample. Stage A HF was defined by coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease. We evaluated whether nationally accepted guidelines for risk factor control were achieved in Stage A patients, including sodium intake, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), cholesterol, and blood pressure (BP). Pharmacologic interventions and socioeconomic factors associated with guideline compliance were also assessed. Results Over 75 million people, or 1 in 3 US adults, have Stage A HF. The mean age of the Stage A population was 56.9 years and 51.5% were women. Seventy-two percent consume ≥2g sodium/day and 49.2% are obese. Of those with CHD, 58.6% were on a statin and 51.8% were on a beta-blocker. In people with diabetes, 43.6% had HbA1c ≥7%, with Mexican Americans more likely to have HbA1c ≥7% . Of those with hypertension, 30.8% had a systolic BP ≥140 or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg. Having health insurance was associated with controlled blood pressure, both in those with hypertension and diabetes. In CHD patients, income ≥$20,000/year and health insurance were inversely associated with LDL ≥100mg/dL with prevalence ratio (PR) of 0.58 (P=0.03) and 0.56 (P=0.03), respectively. Conclusions One-third of the US adult population has Stage A HF. Prevention efforts should focus on those with poorly controlled comorbid disease."

Dual function of C-type lectin-like receptors in the immune system.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The signature of CLEC is in the presence of a stretch of 115–130 amino acid residues known as the C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), which is originally identified as carbohydrate-recognition domain in a family of Ca2+-dependent animal lectins (3Dodd R.B. Drickamer K. Lectin-like proteins in model organisms: implications for evolution of carbohydrate-binding activity.Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 71R-79RCrossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The CTLD-fold has a characteristic double-loop (“loop-in-a-loop”) stabilized by two highly conserved disulfide bridges (4Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E. The C-type lectin-like domain superfamily.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6179-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The long loop region contains a conserved “WND” or “ENC” motif for Ca2+ binding and dimerization in some C-type lectins (5Drickamer K. Dodd R.B. C-Type lectin-like domains in Caenorhabditis elegans: predictions from the complete genome sequence.Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1357-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The CTLDs of CLEC members bind a variety of glycans, and it is now clear that even CTLDs with similar structures can bind ligands in distinct ways. Based on their ligand-binding properties, CTLD can be divided into two groups based on the presence of “glutamic acid-proline-asparagine” (EPN) and “glutamine-proline-aspartic acid” (QPD) motifs in a long loop region. CTLDs with the “EPN” motif usually bind mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and fucose, whereas the CTLDs with the “QPD” motif usually bind galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine (5Drickamer K. Dodd R.B.

The classical CLECs (such as selectins, collectins, and mannose-binding proteins) bind glycans in Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas members of Syk-coupled CLEC receptors (such as Dectin-1/CLEC7A and MDL1/CLEC5A) bind glycans in a Ca2+-independent manner (7Brown G.D.

Moreover, proteins with less closely related CTLDs (such as CD69, CD72, KLRF1, of NK receptor family) do not appear to have carbohydrate-binding activity. In the human genome, there are at least 57 CTLD-containing proteins divided into XVI groups (9Varki A.C. R. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Bertozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. C-type Lectins.in: Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. Essentials of Glycobiology. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2009: 425-437Google Scholar). Among these proteins, we are especially interested in group XV, the CLEC18 family, for following reasons: 1) the clec18 gene cluster contains three genes (clec18a, clec18b, and clec18c) located in human chromosome 16q22.1 (clec18a and clec18c), and 16q22.3 (clec18b). 2) Translation of clec18 cDNA predicted an N-linked polypeptide with a C-type lectin domain (CTLD) in the C terminus, and the SCP/TAPS (sperm-coating protein Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7) domain (also known as CAP (cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1) domain), which is a conserved tertiary α-β-α structure stabilized by disulfide bonds. 3) Proteins of the SCP/TAPS/CAP domain have been proposed to play significant roles in host-pathogen interactions, reproduction, development, and immune function (10Cantacessi C. Campbell B.E. Visser A. Geldhof P. Nolan M.J. Nisbet A.J. Matthews J.B. Loukas A. Hofmann A. Otranto D. Sternberg P.W. Gasser R.B.

However, the biochemical features of CLEC18 have not been tested yet. In this study, we developed a real-time reverse transcription PCR-based platform with fluorescent hybridization probe to detect the presence of CLEC18 in various cell lines and primary cells, followed by direct sequencing cDNAs to confirm the PCR-based typing method. We found that CLEC18 mRNAs and proteins were detectable in various cell lines and human peripheral blood cells. Furthermore, CLEC18 encode N-linked glycoproteins located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and endosomes. Moreover, amino acid residues Ser/Arg339 and Asp/Asn421 located in the CTLD domain contribute to their differential glycan binding specificity. This observation suggests that CLEC18 may bind to various glycoconjugates with distinct affinity, and contribute to differential immune responses to glycoconjugates expressed on foreign antigens or altered self-antigen in ER, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol according to the supplier's instructions, then subjected to reverse transcription using a RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Burlington ON, Canada) as template for PCR amplification. The CLEC18 cDNAs were amplified by denaturing for 60 s at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 70 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 80 s. The amplified cDNA fragment was ligated into yTA vector (RBC TA cloning vector kit) before being subcloned into pCMV-Tag4A vector (Stratagene) for expression in mammalian cells. To sequence the CLEC18 cDNA fragment extending from the SCP/TAPS domain to the CTLD domain (nucleotides 211 to 1304), a cDNA fragment was performed by a thermocycler (GeneAmp® PCR System 9700, Applied Biosystem®). The PCR program (denature/annealing/extension) for amplification is as follows: 98 °C, 10 s at 63 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and 70 s for 30 cycles. The polymorphism of CLEC18A/B/C was determined by real-time PCR with hybridization probes (Roche Life Sciences). The position of primers are as shown in Fig. 2, whereas the sequences of PCR primers and hybridization probes are listed in Table 1. PCR was performed by a thermocycler (LightCycler480® II, Roche), followed by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 60 s to determine CLEC18 polymorphism. The PCR program (denature/annealing/extension) for amplification of the CTLD domain and is as follows: 95 °C, 10 s at 66 °C, 10 s at 72 °C, and 10 s. The amplification cycles were followed by a melting cycle, in which DNA was denaturated at 95 °C for 60 s using a rate of 4.4 °C/s, cooled to 40 °C for 60 s using a rate of 1.5 °C/s and held for 30 s. The temperature was then raised to 75 °C with a transition rate of 0.03 °C/s. Fluorescence was continuously monitored during the melt.TABLE 1Primer listsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the whole blood of healthy human donors by standard density-gradient centrifugation with Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare primary macrophage, CD14+ cells were purified from PBMCs by high-gradient magnetic sorting, using the VarioMACS technique with anti-CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH). Cells were then incubated in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with human M-CSF or GM-CSF/IL-4 for 7 days as described previously (12Hsu T.L. Chang Y.C. Chen S.J. Liu Y.J. Chiu A.W.

For Western blotting analysis, cells (1 × 106) were lysed by RIPA buffer, followed by fractionation on 12% SDS-PAGE, before blotting onto PVDF membrane. Lysates were probed with anti-CLEC18 mAb (clone 3A9E6), followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Millpore AP181P) and ImmobilonTM Western Chemiliminescent HRP Substrate (MilliporeTM). For flow cytometry analysis, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% saponin and incubated with the Alexa 647-conjugated anti-CLEC18 mAb (clone 3A9E6), then examined by flow cytometer (VerseTM, BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by the FlowJowTM software. Adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min before incubation in blocking buffer (10% BSA in PBS) for 60 min. Cells were then incubated with anti-CLEC18 mAb (40 μg/ml in 3% BSA/PBS, room temperature for 1 h), anti-calreticulin (dilution range 1:100 in 3% BSA/PBS, 4 °C, overnight), anti-GM130 (dilution range 1:150 in 3% BSA/PBS, 4 °C, overnight), and anti-EEA1 (dilution range 1:100 in 3% BSA/PBS, 4 °C, overnight), respectively. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h, and then Hoechst 33342 for 10 min. Samples were then mounted and observed under fluorescence confocal microscopy (Olympus FV10i). Alternatively, cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red (250 nm) or LysoTracker (100 nm) at 37 °C for 1 h to observe their colocalization with CLEC18. To understand whether CLEC18A is a secretory protein, pCMV-Tag4A or pCMV-Tag4A-CLEC18A (2 μg) was transfected into 293T cells (2 × 105), respectively, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 48 h before harvesting. Cell lysates or supernatant were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, A2220) to pulldown CLEC18A. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, then probed with anti-CLEC18 mAb (clone 3A9E6), and further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Millpore AP181P) and ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (MilliporeTM) subsequently for detection. Alternatively, the immunoprecipitates were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE, then eluted from gel for mass spectrometry analysis. The eluted proteins were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis using the Thermo Finnigan LTQ FT Ultra High Performance Mass Spectrometer (Conquer scientific). The secretory CLEC18 in culture supernatants and sera was determined using a ELISA kit (CUSABIO Life Science). DNA fragments encoding the CTLD domain of CLEC18A/B/C were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-hIgG1 Fc (mut) vector to generate CLEC18A/A-1/B/C Fc fusion proteins, respectively. PCR primers are listed in Table 1. The CLEC18B cDNA was generated by two steps of PCR to insert exon B using CLEC18A cDNA as template. The CLEC18.Fc fusion proteins were overexpressed by using the FreeStyle 293 Expression System (Invitrogen). Briefly, 3 × 107 293F cells in 28 ml of culture medium were transfected with a mixture of 30 μg of plasmid DNA and 60 μl of 293fectinTM in a total of 2 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). The culture supernatants were harvested at days 3 and 5, and the recombinant CLEC18.Fc fusion proteins were purified by Protein A column (GE Healthcare). Samples of GLPS-F3 were weighed, dissolved, and diluted with 100 mm Tris buffer (pH 9.5) to give 20 μg/ml as described previously (14Hsu T.L. Cheng S.C. Yang W.B. Chin S.W. Chen B.H. Huang M.T.

Chem. 2009; 284: 34479-34489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GLPS-F3 was immobilized in the wells of 96-well plates (50 μl/well, Corning) and incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 200 μl of blocking buffer (2% BSA/TBST) for 1 h at room temperature before washing with TBST (0.05% Tween 20/TBS) twice. Each well was incubated with 100 μl of CLEC.Fc fusion protein (2 μg/ml in 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% BSA/TBST) in the presence or absence of various glycans (Megazyme) as competitors for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBST, each well was incubated with 100 μl of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG Ab (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 1% BSA/TBST (1:5000) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by addition of 100 μl of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BD Biosciences) for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by 1 n H2SO4 before subjecting to analysis by an ELISA reader (TECAN). Alternatively, fusion protein was incubated with zymosans at 4 °C for 1 h and washed with PBS, followed by incubation with anti-hIgG1-FITC (1:200) at 4 °C for 30 min and then analyzed using a VerseTM flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJowTM software. The clec18 gene cluster contains three loci: clec18a (16q22.1), clec18c (16q22.1), and clec18b (16q22.3). Both clec18a (Gene ID 348174) and clec18c (Gene ID 283971) comprise 12 exons, whereas a predicted extra exon (denoted as exon B) located between exons X and XI is found in clec18b (Gene ID 497190) (Fig. 1, A and B). clec18a (NM_182619.3) and clec18c (NM_173619.3) encode a 446-amino acid (aa) polypeptide, respectively, whereas clec18b is predicted to encode a 455-amino acid polypeptide with the extra nine amino acids (LVWLSAAMG) derived from exon B (AGG CUG GUG UGG CUG AGU GCU GCC AUG GGGU) within the CTLD (Fig. 1C). Compared with CLEC18A, CLEC18C is almost identical with CLEC18A except 2 amino acids (Thr91 → Ile91, Val118 → Als118) located in SCP/TAPS/CAP domain (aa 45–190) and 1 amino acid (Asp421 → Asn421) in WND motif located in CTLD. In addition, four amino acid residues (Thr91 → Ile91, Val118 → Ala118, Ala173 → Thr173, Arg185 → Gly185) located in the SCP/TAPS domain (aa 45–190), and one amino acid residue (Val196 → Ile196) located between the SCP/TAPS/CAP domain and EGF regions (aa 232–292) were noted among CLEC18A, CLEC18B, and CLEC18C. Moreover, CLEC18A-1 (AAI41809.1), which contains three distinct amino acid residues from CLEC18A (Val118 → Ala118 and Thr151 → Met151 in SCP/TAPS/CAP domain and Ser339 → Arg339 in CTLD) was found in the human genome database (Fig. 1C). Alignment of human CLEC18 with CLEC18 of other species shows that CLEC18 is highly conserved in CTLD, but the predicted 9-amino acid insertion is only found in human CLEC18B and chimpanzee CLEC18 (Fig. 1D). The typical motifs of CTLDs, such as “WIGL” (aa 370–373), “QPD” (aa 399–401), and “WND” (aa 419–421), are found in both human and non-human CLEC18. It is interesting to note that the “Asp421/430” located in the “WND” motif of CLEC18A/B is replaced with “Asn421” in human CLEC18C. Moreover, the basic amino acid residues Arg322 and Arg329 found in human and chimpanzee are replaced with Gly322 and Gly/Glu329 in non-primates. Furthermore, the aliphatic amino acid residues Ile360, Ala385, and His403 found in human and chimpanzee are replaced with Thr/Met/Ser369, Thr/Asp385, and Gln403 in non-primate CLEC18. Due to the highly conserved cDNA sequences among CLEC18, nucleotide residues (Cys/Ala1017 and Gly/Ala1261) located in CTLD were used to discriminate each member of the CLEC18 family by hybridization probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay. In addition, a probe hybridizing the extra exon B was used to detect CLEC18B (Fig. 2). We found that CLEC18A mRNA was expressed in almost all the cell lines tested, whereas CLEC18A-1 was detectable in CHME3, A549, and the human peripheral blood cells (PBCs) of three donors. CLEC18C mRNA was also detectable in some cell lines, but was less prevalent than CLEC18A. However, we cannot detect CLEC18B mRNA in all the cell lines by PCR using the probe hybridizing the exon B (Table 2, part A). We further investigated the expression of CLEC18 mRNAs in human PBMCs from healthy donors. Although CLEC18A mRNAs were detectable in all the samples tested, the expression of CLEC18A-1 and CLEC18C was less prevalent than CLEC18A. However, CLEC18B mRNA is not detectable in all the samples tested (Table 2, part B).TABLE 2Typing of CLEC18 family in cell lines and human peripheral blood cell+, detectable; −:, undetectable; “∗” were confirmed by cDNA clone sequencing. Open table in a new tab +, detectable; −:, undetectable; “∗” were confirmed by cDNA clone sequencing. We further examined the presence of other CLEC18A/B/C alleles in cell lines and human PBCs by sequencing the CLEC18 cDNAs amplified by RT-PCR. Interestingly, two discrepancies with the reference sequences were found. 1) The dominant amino acid residues located in the SCP/TAPS/CAP domain of CLEC18A was Thr91-Ala118-Met151-Ala173-Arg185-Val196, not the Thr91-Val118-Thr151-Ala173-Arg185-Val196 (reference sequence: NP_872425.2) (Table 3, part A); 2) cDNA clones with the Ile91-Ala118-Thr151-Thr173-Gly185-Ile196 (characteristic of CLEC18B) in the SCP/TAPS/CAP domain do not contain the extra 9 amino acids (LVWLSAAMG) derived from exon B, among all the cell lines and human PBCs we sequenced (Table 3, B and C). This observation suggests that the putative exon B is absent in human CLEC18B, and multiple alleles are present in all the members of CLEC18 family.TABLE 3Sequencing of CLEC18 family in cell lines and human peripheral blood cell+, detectable; −, undetectable; “∗” were confirmed by cDNA clone sequencing; “”: real time PCR is negative, but sequencing is positive (but without the extra exon B).CLEC18A∗, minor allele; CLEC18B∗∗, without exon B. Open table in a new tab +, detectable; −, undetectable; “∗” were confirmed by cDNA clone sequencing; “”: real time PCR is negative, but sequencing is positive (but without the extra exon B). CLEC18A∗, minor allele; CLEC18B∗∗, without exon B. We further investigated the expression of CLEC18 by Western blotting and flow cytometry. We found that anti-CLEC18 mAb (clone 3A9E6) detects a specific band migrating at 50 kDa in 293T cells transfected with CLEC18A and CLEC18C cDNAs, respectively (Fig. 3A). The peptide was eluted for mass spectrometry analysis, and the sequences of peptides matched CLEC18 perfectly (Fig. 3B). Because two potential glycosylation sites (Asn144 and Asn243) were predicted when analyzing CLEC18 by Vector NTI software (version 11), we asked whether CLEC18 are N-linked glycosylated proteins. To address this question, FLAG-tagged CLEC18A-transfected 293T cells were incubated with tunicamycin to observe the change of Mr of CLEC18. We found the CLEC18A polypeptide migrated from 50 to 45 kDa in a time-dependent manner when probed with anti-FLAG mAb (Fig. 3C), and a similar result was observed after peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 3D). This observation indicates that CLEC18A is a 50-kDa N-linked glycoprotein. We further examined its expression in human PBCs and CD14+-derived macrophages and dendritic cells by flow cytometry and Western blotting. To address this question, CD14+-derived dendritic cells were incubated with GM-CSF + IL-4 (25 + 20 ng/ml), GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), and M-CSF (10 ng/ml) for 7 days, respectively, to differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs), GM-macrophages (GM-Mφ), and M-macrophages (M-Mφ). We found that CLEC18 are abundantly expressed in human PBCs, including T cells (CD3+), B cells (CD19+), granulocytes (CD66b+), and monocytes (CD14+) (Fig. 4A). Compared with monocytes, CLEC18 were further up-regulated in monocyte-derived DCs, GM-Mφ, and M-Mφ (Fig. 4B, upper), and the protein expression level in accord with CLEC18 mRNA levels was determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 4B, lower). This observation suggested the CLEC18 expression is up-regulated by cytokines. However, the expression of CLEC18 was low and barely detectable in several hematopoietic cell lines (Fig. 4C) and non-hematopoietic cell lines (data not shown). It has been shown that members of protein with the SCP/CAP domain are soluble proteins (11Gibbs G.M. Roelants K. O'Bryan M.K.

Concepts. 2013; 4: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), thus we asked whether CLEC18 are secretory proteins. To address this question, culture supernatants of pCMV-Flag-CLEC18A-transfected 293T cells were incubated with anti-FLAG mAb to pulldown soluble CLEC18A, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-CLEC18 mAb (clone 3A9E6). We found that CLEC18A is not only detectable in culture supernatant of pCMV-Flag-CLEC18A-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4D), but also in the culture supernatant of DCs, GM-Mφ, and M-Mφ (upper, Fig. 4E), as well as in human sera (Fig. 4E, lower) as determined by ELISA. This observation suggests that CLEC18A is a secretory protein. Because CLEC18 were detectable in cell lysates, we further investigated its subcellular localization. To address this question, human CD14+-derived M-Mφ was incubated with anti-CLEC18A mAb, followed by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse mAb. To determine its subcellular localization, M-Mφ was also co-incubated with anti-GM 130 mAb (rabbit), anti-calreticulin mAb (rabbit), and anti-EEA1 mAb (rabbit), respectively, followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit mAb. We found that CLEC18 were co-localized with GM 130 (marker for Golgi apparatus), calreticulin (marker for endoplasmic reticulum), and EEA1 (marker for early endosome), but not with MitoTracker (mitochondria dye) or LysoTracker (lysosome dye) under the same conditions (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that CLEC18 are located in the ER, Golgi apparatus, and early endosomes. We further used a human tissue array to detect the expression of CLEC18 by immunohistochemistry staining. We found that CLEC18 were expressed in human spleen (leukocytes), brain (microglia), liver (hepatocytes), gall bladder (epithelial cells), fallopian tube (epithelial cells), and testis (epithelial cells) (Fig. 6). This observation suggests that CLEC18 are not only expressed in hematopoietic lineages, but also expressed in epithelial and parenchymal cells. We further investigated the role of amino acid residues Ser/Arg339 and Asp/Asn421 in CTLD of the CLEC18 family in the binding ability to glycans. To address this question, Ser339 and Asp421 were located in CTLD of CLEC18A (Ser339, Asp421) were mutated into Arg339 and Asn421, respectively, to generate CLEC18A-1 (Arg339, Asp421) and CLEC18C (Ser339, Asn421). The CTLD domain of CLEC18A and mutants was ligated with pcDNA3.1-hIgG1 Fc (mut) to obtain pCLEC18A.Fc, pCLEC18A-1.Fc, and pCLEC18C.Fc, respectively, followed by transfection to 293F cells to obtain recombinant fusion proteins as described previously (8Chen S.T.

Whether the regulation of human telomerase holoenzyme assembly contributes to the cell cycle restriction of telomerase function is unknown. We investigated the steady-state levels, assembly, and exchange dynamics of human telomerase subunits with quantitative in vivo cross-linking and other methods. We determined the physical association of telomerase subunits in cells blocked or progressing through the cell cycle as synchronized by multiple protocols. The total level of human telomerase RNA (hTR) was invariant across the cell cycle. In vivo snapshots of telomerase holoenzyme composition established that hTR remains bound to human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) throughout all phases of the cell cycle, and subunit competition assays suggested that hTERT-hTR interaction is not readily exchangeable. In contrast, the telomerase holoenzyme Cajal body-associated protein, TCAB1, was released from hTR in mitotic cells coincident with TCAB1 delocalization from Cajal bodies. This telomerase holoenzyme disassembly was reversible with cell cycle progression without any change in total TCAB1 protein level. Consistent with differential cell cycle regulation of hTERT-hTR and TCAB1-hTR protein-RNA interactions, overexpression of hTERT or TCAB1 had limited if any influence on hTR assembly of the other subunit. Overall, these findings revealed a cell cycle regulation that disables human telomerase association with telomeres while preserving the co-folded hTERT-hTR ribonucleoprotein catalytic core.

https://openalex.org/W866209724,"Dry eye complaints are ranked as the most frequent symptoms of patients visiting ophthalmologists. Conjunctivochalasis is a common dry eye disorder, which can cause an unstable tear film and ocular discomfort. The severe conjunctivochalasis characterized by high LId-Parallel COnjunctival Folds (LIPCOF) degree usually requires surgical intervention, where a conservative therapy would be highly desirable. Here we examined the efficacy of a preservative-free, inorganic salt-free unit-dose artificial tear, called Conheal containing isotonic glycerol and 0.015% sodium hyaluronate in a prospective, unmasked, self-controlled study involving 20 patients. The regular use of the glycerol/hyaluronate artificial tear in three months caused a significant improvement in the recorded parameters. Conjunctivochalasis decreased from a mean LIPCOF degree of 2.9±0.4 on both eyes to 1.4±0.6 on the right (median decrease of -2 points, 95% CI from -2.0 to -1.0), and to 1.4±0.7 on the left eye (median decrease of -1 points, 95% CI from -2.0 to -1.0) (p<0.001 for both sides). The tear film breakup time (TFBUT) lengthened from 4.8±1.9 seconds on both eyes to 5.9±2.3 seconds (mean increase of 1.1 seconds, 95% CI from 0.2 to 2.0) and 5.7±1.8 seconds (mean increase of 0.9 seconds, 95% CI from 0.3 to 1.5) on the right and left eyes, respectively (pright eyes = 0.020, pleft eyes = 0.004). The corneal lissamine staining (Oxford Scheme grade) was reduced from 1.3±0.6 on the right and 1.4±0.6 on the left eye significantly (p<0.001) to 0.3±0.4 and 0.2±0.4 on the right and the left eyes. The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire score indicating the subjective complaints of the patients also decreased from a mean value of 36.2±25.3 to 15.6±16.7 (p<0.001). In this study, the artificial tear, Conheal decreased the grade of the conjunctivochalasis significantly after one month of regular use already, from the LIPCOF degree 3, considered as indication of conjunctival surgery, to a LIPCOF degree 2 or lower requiring a conservative therapy. Our results raise the possibility that vision-related quality of life can be significantly improved by conservative therapies even in severe conjunctivochalasis.

The enzyme activity of BaM6PI was optimal at pH and temperature of 7.5 and 70°C, respectively, with a kcat/Km of 13,900 s-1 mM-1 for mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). The purified BaM6PI demonstrated the highest catalytic efficiency of all characterized M6PIs. Although M6PIs have been characterized from several other sources, BaM6PI is distinguished from other M6PIs by its wide pH range and high catalytic efficiency for M6P. The binding orientation of the substrate M6P in the active site of BaM6PI shed light on the molecular basis of its unusually high activity. BaM6PI showed 97% substrate conversion from M6P to fructose-6-phosphate demonstrating the potential for using BaM6PI in industrial applications."

https://openalex.org/W862875660,"Although the cascading impact of predators depends critically on the relative role of lethal predation and predation risk, we lack an understanding of how human-caused stressors may shift this balance. Emergent evidence suggests that pollution may increase the importance of predator consumptive effects by weakening the effects of fear perceived by prey. However, this oversimplification ignores the possibility that pollution may also alter predator consumptive effects. In particular, contaminants may impair the consumptive effects of predators by altering density-dependent interactions among prey conspecifics. No study has directly compared predator consumptive and non-consumptive effects in polluted versus non-polluted settings. We addressed this issue by using laboratory mesocosms to examine the impact of sublethal doses of copper on tri-trophic interactions among estuarine predator crabs Cancer productus, carnivorous whelk prey Urosalpinx cinerea, and the basal resource barnacles Balanus glandula. We investigated crab consumptive effects (whelks culled without crab chemical cues), non-consumptive effects (whelks not culled with crab chemical cues), and total effects (whelks culled with crab chemical cues) on whelks in copper polluted and non-polluted waters. Realistic copper concentrations suppressed the effects of simulated crab lethal predation (whelk culling) by removing density-dependent feeding by whelks. Specifically, reductions in conspecific density occurring in elevated copper levels did not trigger the normal increase in whelk consumption rates of barnacles. Weakened effects of fear were only observed at extremely high copper levels, suggesting consumptive effects were more sensitive to pollution. Thus, pollution may shape communities by altering the roles of predators and interactions among prey."
https://openalex.org/W1954546295,"The adaptor protein-1 complex (AP-1), which transports cargo between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, plays a role in the trafficking of Atp7a, a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a copper-dependent membrane enzyme. Lack of any of the four AP-1 subunits impairs function, and patients with MEDNIK syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by lack of expression of the σ1A subunit, exhibit clinical and biochemical signs of impaired copper homeostasis. To explore the role of AP-1 in copper homeostasis in neuroendocrine cells, we used corticotrope tumor cells in which AP-1 function was diminished by reducing expression of its μ1A subunit. Copper levels were unchanged when AP-1 function was impaired, but cellular levels of Atp7a declined slightly. The ability of PAM to function was assessed by monitoring 18-kDa fragment-NH2 production from proopiomelanocortin. Reduced AP-1 function made 18-kDa fragment amidation more sensitive to inhibition by bathocuproine disulfonate, a cell-impermeant Cu(I) chelator. The endocytic trafficking of PAM was altered, and PAM-1 accumulated on the cell surface when AP-1 levels were reduced. Reduced AP-1 function increased the Atp7a presence in early/recycling endosomes but did not alter the ability of copper to stimulate its appearance on the plasma membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation of a small fraction of PAM and Atp7a supports the suggestion that copper can be transferred directly from Atp7a to PAM, a process that can occur only when both proteins are present in the same subcellular compartment. Altered luminal cuproenzyme function may contribute to deficits observed when the AP-1 function is compromised.

https://openalex.org/W875475429,"Dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1), a gene encoding dysbindin-1, has been identified as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. Functioning with partners in synapses or the cytoplasm, this gene regulates neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter release. Loss of dysbindin-1 affects schizophrenia pathology. Dysbindin-1 is also found in the nucleus, however, the characteristics of dysbindin in the nucleus are not fully understood. Here, we found that dysbindin-1A is degraded in the nucleus via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that amino acids 2-41 at the N-terminus are required for this process. By interacting with p65, dysbindin-1A promotes the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B in the nucleus and positively regulates MMP-9 expression. Taken together, the data obtained in this study demonstrate that dysbindin-1A protein levels are highly regulated in the nucleus and that dysbindin-1A regulates transcription factor NF-kappa B activity to promote the expression of MMP-9 and TNF-α."
https://openalex.org/W1963064808,"Pygopus 2 (Pygo2/PYGO2) is an evolutionarily conserved coactivator and chromatin effector in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and differentiation in various normal and malignant tissues. Although PYGO2 is highly overexpressed in a number of human cancers, the molecular mechanism underlying its deregulation is largely unknown. Here we report that Pygo2 protein is degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is posttranslationally stabilized through phosphorylation by activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling. Specifically, Pygo2 is stabilized upon inhibition of the proteasome, and its intracellular level is regulated by Cullin 4 (Cul4) and DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), components of the Cul4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, Pygo2 is phosphorylated at multiple residues, and Akt-mediated phosphorylation at serine 48 leads to its decreased ubiquitylation and increased stability. Finally, we provide evidence that Akt and its upstream growth factors act in parallel with Wnt to stabilize Pygo2. Taken together, our findings highlight chromatin regulator Pygo2 as a common node downstream of oncogenic Wnt and Akt signaling pathways and underscore posttranslational modification, particularly phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, as a significant mode of regulation of Pygo2 protein expression.

In the canonical pathway, binding of Wnt ligands to membrane receptor/co-receptor triggers intracellular events culminating in the inactivation of an axin-APC-GSK3 destruction complex, which normally directs β-catenin for phosphorylation and degradation (1Clevers H.

Exemplifying the Wnt-Akt cross-talk, Akt phosphorylates GSK3β at serine 9 and inhibits its activity, leading to increased stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin (44Cross D.A.

In this work, we report findings showing that Akt phosphorylates Pygo2 at serine 48 to reduce its ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation. We identify Cul4-DDB1 E3 ligases as the candidate enzymatic complexes that are responsible for the ubiquitylation of Pygo2. Moreover, we provide evidence that the Akt regulation of Pygo2 occurs in the context of growth factor/PI3K signaling and show that the Pygo2-stabilizing effects of Wnt and Akt activation are additive. Taken together, our data uncover a new layer of mechanistic link between two key oncogenic signaling pathways, namely a convergence between Wnt signaling and the Akt pathway on chromatin regulator Pygo2.

A lentiviral vector expressing FLAG-Pygo2 was co-transfected with packaging vectors pHR and pVSVG into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668019). Recombinant lentiviruses were harvested from the medium 48 h after transfection. HC11 cells at 50–70% confluence were infected with viral supernatants containing 10 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h, after which fresh medium was added to the infected cells, which were subsequently selected with puromycin to establish the stable cell line expressing FLAG-Pygo2 protein. FLAG-Pygo2 was affinity-purified from FLAG-Pygo2-expressing HC11 cells. Briefly, cells were grown to ∼90% confluence and lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with an anti-phosphatase mixture (50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 30 mm NaPPi) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotenin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). The cleared lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma, A2220) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times in cold lysis buffer and eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma, F4799). The purified sample was then separated by a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the protein bands were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to validate purity. Protein bands were cut for in-gel trypsin digestion as described previously (57Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins silver-stained polyacrylamide gels.Anal.

A concatenated database (22,268,936 sequence entries) composed of a normal UniProt database (2010.03.30) and a random form of the normal database was used for database searching. Mouse was selected as the restricted species. Trypsin was set as the enzyme with a maximum of two missed cleavage sites. The mass tolerance for parent ion was set at ±20 ppm, whereas ±0.8 Da tolerance was chosen for the fragment ions. Chemical modifications such as protein N-terminal acetylation, methionine oxidation, N-terminal pyroglutamine, and phosphorylation on serine and threonine were selected as variable modifications. The Search Compare program in Protein Prospector was used for summarization, validation, and comparison of results. The identified phosphorylated peptides have been further validated by manual inspection of their MS/MS spectra."
https://openalex.org/W922718198,"Ecosystem degradation has become common throughout the world. On coral reefs, macroalgal outbreaks are one of the most widely documented signs of degradation. This study simulated local-scale degradation on a healthy coral reef to determine how resident taxa, with the potential to reverse algal outbreaks, respond. We utilized a combination of acoustic and video monitoring to quantify changes in the movements and densities, respectively, of coral reef herbivores following a simulated algal outbreak. We found an unprecedented accumulation of functionally important herbivorous taxa in response to algal increases. Herbivore densities increased by 267% where algae were present. The increase in herbivore densities was driven primarily by an accumulation of the browsing taxa Naso unicornis and Kyphosus vaigiensis, two species which are known to be important in removing macroalgae and which may be capable of reversing algal outbreaks. However, resident individuals at the site of algal increase exhibited no change in their movements. Instead, analysis of the size classes of the responding individuals indicates that large functionally-important non-resident individuals changed their movement patterns to move in and feed on the algae. This suggests that local-scale reef processes may not be sufficient to mitigate the effects of local degradation and highlights the importance of mobile links and cross-scale interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2161109437,"Clinically, we found the increased incidence of acquired colesteatoma in the patients with osteoporosis. In this study, we used a retrospective cohort to examine this association and to investigate the possible mechanism.We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study by using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). We identified an osteoporosis cohort comprising 37 124 patients newly diagnosed with osteoporosis aged 20 years or older. Patients in the comparison cohort had no history of osteoporosis and were frequency matched with the patients in the osteoporosis cohort according to sex, age, and index year.The acquired cholesteatoma incidence rates for the osteoporosis and comparison cohorts were 1.12 and 0.83 per 1000 person-years, respectively. After we adjusted for confounding factors, the osteoporosis cohort exhibited a 1.32-fold increased acquired cholesteatoma risk relative to the comparison cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-1.57). In addition, patients with no history of otitis media (HR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.11-1.59), cancer (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.12-1.60), or COPD (HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.05-1.52) in the osteoporosis cohort exhibited an increased risk of subsequent acquired cholesteatoma relative to those in the comparison cohort.Our cohort study indicated that patients with osteoporosis had a 1.31-fold increased acquired cholesteatoma risk relative to the comparison cohort. This risk was further increased in patients with comorbid otitis media. Hence, we recommend that otolaryngologists evaluate the condition of the middle ear of patients with osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W881363245,"The most common modeling approaches to understanding incidence, prevalence and control of chronic diseases in populations, such as statistical regression models, are limited when it comes to dealing with the complexity of those problems. Those complex adaptive systems have characteristics such as emerging properties, self-organization and feedbacks, which structure the system stability and resistance to changes. Recently, system science approaches have been proposed to deal with the range, complexity, and multifactor nature of those public health problems. In this paper we applied a multilevel systemic approach to create an integrated, coherent, and increasingly precise conceptual framework, capable of aggregating different partial or specialized studies, based on the challenges of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health – ELSA-Brasil. The failure to control blood pressure found in several of the study's subjects was discussed, based on the proposed model, analyzing different loops, time lags, and feedback that influence this outcome in a population with high educational level, with reasonably good health services access. We were able to identify the internal circularities and cycles that generate the system’s resistance to change. We believe that this study can contribute to propose some new possibilities of the research agenda and to the discussion of integrated actions in the field of public health."
https://openalex.org/W1821337819,"A great challenge in wastewater bioremediation is the sustained activity of viable microorganisms, which can contribute to the breakdown of waste contaminants, especially in alkaline pH conditions. Identification of extremophiles with bioremediation capability can improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment. Here, we report the discovery of an electrochemically active alkaliphilic halotolerant bacterium, Anditalea andensis ANESC-ST (=CICC10485T=NCCB 100412T), which is capable of generating bioelectricity in alkaline–saline conditions. A. andensis ANESC-ST was shown to grow in alkaline conditions between pH 7.0–11.0 and also under high salt condition (up to 4 wt% NaCl). Electrical output was further demonstrated in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) with an average current density of ~0.5 µA/cm2, even under the harsh condition of 4 wt% NaCl and pH 9.0. Subsequent introduction of secreted extracellular metabolites into MFCs inoculated with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa yielded enhanced electrical output. The ability of A. andensis ANESC-ST to generate energy under alkaline–saline conditions points towards a solution for bioelectricity recovery from alkaline–saline wastewater. This is the first report of A.andensis ANESC-ST producing bioelectricity at high salt concentration and pH."
https://openalex.org/W903656694,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia is one of the chronic inflammatory conditions in ageing male populations. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a major autoimmune disease and is also regarded as a chronic inflammatory disorder. Although RA and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) may share the same underlying etiologies, almost no study has ever attempted to explore the relationship between RA and BPE. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between RA and BPE using a population-based dataset. This case-control study used data retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. This study comprised 18,716 patients with BPE and 18,716 age-matched patients without BPE. Conditional logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for having been previously diagnosed with RA between patients with BPE and comparison patients. In total, 485 of the 37,432 sampled patients (1.3%) had received a prior RA diagnosis. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of prior RA between cases and controls (1.6% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001). After adjusting for patient’s urbanization level, monthly income, geographic region, and obesity, the adjusted OR was 1.54 (95% CI = 1.28~1.85) for patients with BPE compared to comparison patients. In addition, the sensitivity analysis showed that BPE was consistently and significantly associated with a prior RA diagnosis even after excluding subjects diagnosed with RA within 1, 2, or 3 years prior to the index date (the adjusted ORs were 1.46, 1.50, and 1.42, respectively). We concluded that there was a significant association between prior RA and BPE. Further large-scale longitudinal studies are suggested to clarify the causal relationship between RA and BPE."
https://openalex.org/W1493180208,"Sleep apnea syndrome, characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH), is linked with increased oxidative stress. This study investigates the mechanisms underlying IH and the effects of IH-induced oxidative stress on cerebellar astrocytes. Rat primary cerebellar astrocytes were kept in an incubator with an oscillating O2 concentration between 20% and 5% every 30 min for 1–4 days. Although the cell loss increased with the duration, the IH incubation didn’t induce apoptosis or necrosis, but rather a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest of cerebellar astrocytes was noted. ROS accumulation was associated with cell loss during IH. PARP activation, resulting in p21 activation and cyclin D1 degradation was associated with cell cycle G0/G1 arrest of IH-treated cerebellar astrocytes. Our results suggest that IH induces cell loss by enhancing oxidative stress, PARP activation and cell cycle G0/G1 arrest in rat primary cerebellar astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2220260057,"The CUB and sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) gene harbors signals provided by clusters of nearby SNPs with 10-2 > p > 10-8 associations in genome wide association (GWAS) studies of addiction-related phenotypes. A CSMD1 intron 3 SNP displays p < 10-8 association with schizophrenia and more modest associations with individual differences in performance on tests of cognitive abilities. CSDM1 encodes a cell adhesion molecule likely to influence development, connections and plasticity of brain circuits in which it is expressed. We tested association between CSMD1 genotypes and expression of its mRNA in postmortem human brains (n = 181). Expression of CSMD1 mRNA in human postmortem cerebral cortical samples differs 15-25%, in individuals with different alleles of simple sequence length and SNP polymorphisms located in the gene's third/fifth introns, providing nominal though not Bonferroni-corrected significance. These data support mice with altered CSMD1 expression as models for common human CSMD1 allelic variation. We tested baseline and/or cocaine-evoked addiction, emotion, motor and memory-related behaviors in +/- and -/- csmd1 knockout mice on mixed and on C57-backcrossed genetic backgrounds. Initial csmd1 knockout mice on mixed genetic backgrounds displayed a variety of coat colors and sizable individual differences in responses during behavioral testing. Backcrossed mice displayed uniform black coat colors. Cocaine conditioned place preference testing revealed significant influences of genotype (p = 0.02). Homozygote knockouts displayed poorer performance on aspects of the Morris water maze task. They displayed increased locomotion in some, though not all, environments. The combined data thus support roles for common level-of-expression CSMD1 variation in a drug reward phenotype relevant to addiction and in cognitive differences that might be relevant to schizophrenia. Mouse model results can complement data from human association findings of modest magnitude that identify likely polygenic influences."
https://openalex.org/W908722069,"Integrin αIIbβ3 plays a central role in the adhesion and aggregation of platelets and thus is essential for hemostasis and thrombosis. Integrin activation requires the transmission of a signal from the small cytoplasmic tails of the α or β subunit to the large extracellular domains resulting in conformational changes of the extracellular domains to enable ligand binding. Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone-5 (Hic-5), a member of the paxillin family, serves as a focal adhesion adaptor protein associated with αIIbβ3 at its cytoplasmic tails. Previous studies suggested Hic-5 as a novel regulator of integrin αIIbβ3 activation and platelet aggregation in mice. To assess this in more detail, we generated Hic-5-null mice and analyzed activation and aggregation of their platelets in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, lack of Hic-5 had no detectable effect on platelet integrin activation and function in vitro and in vivo under all tested conditions. These results indicate that Hic-5 is dispensable for integrin αIIbβ3 activation and consequently for arterial thrombosis and hemostasis in mice."
https://openalex.org/W917188495,"Purpose To determine whether people with central field loss (CFL) from macular degeneration have improved ability to recognize a particularly difficult spatial configuration embedded in noise, the peripherally-viewed ‘ladder contour’. The visibility of these configuration has been linked to general contour integration ability and crowding limitations in peripheral vision. Methods We used a trial-based yes-no task. CFL patients and normally-sighted controls performed the task, looking for ladder contours embedded in a field of randomly oriented Gabor patches, at a range of stimulus presentation times (varying stimulus difficulty). Viewing eccentricity in CFL patients was set by their preferred retinal loci (PRLs) and matched artificially in the control group. The contours were presented so as to be tangent to the CFL region, given a patient’s PRL location. Results CFL and normally-sighted groups performed similarly on the task. The only significant determinant of performance was the viewing eccentricity. Conclusions CFL patients do not seem to develop any improved ability to recognize ladder contours with their parafoveal retina, which suggests that there is no underlying improvement in contour integration or reduction in crowding limitations in the region of the PRL despite extended daily use."
https://openalex.org/W932623474,"As a result of the international division of labor, the trade value distribution on different products substantiated by international trade flows can be regarded as one country’s strategy for competition. According to the empirical data of trade flows, countries may spend a large fraction of export values on ubiquitous and competitive products. Meanwhile, countries may also diversify their exports share on different types of products to reduce the risk. In this paper, we report that the export share distribution curves can be derived by maximizing the entropy of shares on different products under the product’s complexity constraint once the international market structure (the country-product bipartite network) is given. Therefore, a maximum entropy model provides a good fit to empirical data. The empirical data is consistent with maximum entropy subject to a constraint on the expected value of the product complexity for each country. One country’s strategy is mainly determined by the types of products this country can export. In addition, our model is able to fit the empirical export share distribution curves of nearly every country very well by tuning only one parameter."
https://openalex.org/W1740624030,"Using the subcutaneous chamber model of infection, we showed previously that a mixture of four endodontic pathogens (EP: P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. intermedius and P. micra) are able to persist without clearance for up to seven days, while a non-pathogenic oral species, S. mitis, was substantially cleared in this time. Here we have compared the cytokine response inside the chambers against these microorganisms. A majority of cytokines tested (17/24) showed different patterns of expression. Several cytokines had a peak of expression at 2 h after infection in response to the EP, while none showed this pattern in S. mitis infections. Chemokines were uniformly present at similar or higher levels in response to S. mitis, with redundant expression of CXCR2 ligands, while several growth/survival factors were present at higher levels in EP infections. Protease activity expressed by EP may be responsible for the lower levels of some chemokines. T-cell associated cytokines were in general expressed at extremely low levels, and did not differ between the two infections. The inflammatory markers IL-6, IL-1α and IL1-β were expressed at similar levels in both infections at early times, while TNFα was preferentially present in S. mitis infections. In EP infected chambers, reciprocal changes in levels of IL-6 and IL-1α were observed at later times suggesting a switch in the inflammatory response. Analysis of the cytokine response to infection with the individual species from the EP mix suggests that P. intermedia drives this inflammatory switch. Together these results show a surprising level of divergence of the host response to pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms associated with oral infections, and supports a dominant effect of P. intermedia in polymicrobial endodontic infections."
https://openalex.org/W908352298,"How organisms move and disperse is crucial to understand how population dynamics relates to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment. Random walk (RW) models are typical tools to describe movement patterns. Whether Lévy or alternative RW better describes forager movements is keenly debated. We get around this issue using the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). GPD includes as specific cases Normal, exponential and power law distributions, which underlie Brownian, Poisson-like and Lévy walks respectively. Whereas previous studies typically confronted a limited set of candidate models, GPD lets the most likely RW model emerge from the data. We illustrate the wide applicability of the method using GPS-tracked seabird foraging movements and fishing vessel movements tracked by Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), both collected in the Peruvian pelagic ecosystem. The two parameters from the fitted GPD, a scale and a shape parameter, provide a synoptic characterization of the observed movement in terms of characteristic scale and diffusive property. They reveal and quantify the variability, among species and individuals, of the spatial strategies selected by predators foraging on a common prey field. The GPD parameters constitute relevant metrics for (1) providing a synthetic and pattern-oriented description of movement, (2) using top predators as ecosystem indicators and (3) studying the variability of spatial behaviour among species or among individuals with different personalities."
