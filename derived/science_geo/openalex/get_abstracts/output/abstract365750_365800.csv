https://openalex.org/W2073062083,"Several lines of evidence point to genetic involvement in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by impaired verbal communication and social interaction. The clinical and genetic complexities of the condition make it difficult to identify susceptibility factors, but two related studies now present robust evidence for a genetic involvement. The first, a genome-wide association study, identifies six single-nucleotide polymorphisms strongly associated with autism. These variants lie between two genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules (cadherins 9 and 10), suggesting possible involvement in ASD pathogenesis. The second study used copy number variation screens to identify genetic variants in two major gene pathways in children with ASDs. The changes are in the ubiquitin pathway, which has previously been associated with neurological disease, and in genes for neuronal cell-adhesion molecules. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social and communication skills. Accumulating evidence suggests a genetic component to ASDs, and here a two-stage, genome-wide approach is used to identify candidate genomic loci enriched in ASD cases. The majority of these loci are found to be involved in neuronal adhesion and ubiquitin degradation, suggesting novel susceptibility mechanisms. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are childhood neurodevelopmental disorders with complex genetic origins1,2,3,4. Previous studies focusing on candidate genes or genomic regions have identified several copy number variations (CNVs) that are associated with an increased risk of ASDs5,6,7,8,9. Here we present the results from a whole-genome CNV study on a cohort of 859 ASD cases and 1,409 healthy children of European ancestry who were genotyped with ∼550,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, in an attempt to comprehensively identify CNVs conferring susceptibility to ASDs. Positive findings were evaluated in an independent cohort of 1,336 ASD cases and 1,110 controls of European ancestry. Besides previously reported ASD candidate genes, such as NRXN1 (ref. 10) and CNTN4 (refs 11, 12), several new susceptibility genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules, including NLGN1 and ASTN2, were enriched with CNVs in ASD cases compared to controls (P = 9.5 × 10-3). Furthermore, CNVs within or surrounding genes involved in the ubiquitin pathways, including UBE3A, PARK2, RFWD2 and FBXO40, were affected by CNVs not observed in controls (P = 3.3 × 10-3). We also identified duplications 55 kilobases upstream of complementary DNA AK123120 (P = 3.6 × 10-6). Although these variants may be individually rare, they target genes involved in neuronal cell-adhesion or ubiquitin degradation, indicating that these two important gene networks expressed within the central nervous system may contribute to the genetic susceptibility of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2144601878,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a group of childhood neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in verbal communication, impairment of social interaction, and restricted and repetitive patterns of interests and behaviour. To identify common genetic risk factors underlying ASDs, here we present the results of genome-wide association studies on a cohort of 780 families (3,101 subjects) with affected children, and a second cohort of 1,204 affected subjects and 6,491 control subjects, all of whom were of European ancestry. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms between cadherin 10 (CDH10) and cadherin 9 (CDH9)—two genes encoding neuronal cell-adhesion molecules—revealed strong association signals, with the most significant SNP being rs4307059 (P = 3.4 × 10-8, odds ratio = 1.19). These signals were replicated in two independent cohorts, with combined P values ranging from 7.4 × 10-8 to 2.1 × 10-10. Our results implicate neuronal cell-adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of ASDs, and represent, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of genome-wide significant association of common variants with susceptibility to ASDs. Several lines of evidence point to genetic involvement in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by impaired verbal communication and social interaction.

The changes are in the ubiquitin pathway, which has previously been associated with neurological disease, and in genes for neuronal cell-adhesion molecules. Although structural variation has been previously associated with autism spectrum disorders, this study reports a genome-wide significant association of common variants with susceptibility to this disorder group. The results implicate neuronal cell-adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of this group of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2150798416,"An efficient method for making directed DNA sequence modifications to plant genes (gene targeting) is at present lacking, thereby frustrating efforts to dissect plant gene function and engineer crop plants that better meet the world's burgeoning need for food, fibre and fuel. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)-enzymes engineered to create DNA double-strand breaks at specific loci-are potent stimulators of gene targeting; for example, they can be used to precisely modify engineered reporter genes in plants. Here we demonstrate high-frequency ZFN-stimulated gene targeting at endogenous plant genes, namely the tobacco acetolactate synthase genes (ALS SuRA and SuRB), for which specific mutations are known to confer resistance to imidazolinone and sulphonylurea herbicides. Herbicide-resistance mutations were introduced into SuR loci by ZFN-mediated gene targeting at frequencies exceeding 2% of transformed cells for mutations as far as 1.3 kilobases from the ZFN cleavage site. More than 40% of recombinant plants had modifications in multiple SuR alleles. The observed high frequency of gene targeting indicates that it is now possible to efficiently make targeted sequence changes in endogenous plant genes."
https://openalex.org/W2153463588,"Mice deficient in the Polycomb repressor Bmi1 develop numerous abnormalities including a severe defect in stem cell self-renewal, alterations in thymocyte maturation and a shortened lifespan. Previous work has implicated de-repression of the Ink4a/Arf (also known as Cdkn2a) locus as mediating many of the aspects of the Bmi1-/- phenotype. Here we demonstrate that cells derived from Bmi1-/- mice also have impaired mitochondrial function, a marked increase in the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and subsequent engagement of the DNA damage response pathway. Furthermore, many of the deficiencies normally observed in Bmi1-/- mice improve after either pharmacological treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or genetic disruption of the DNA damage response pathway by Chk2 (also known as Chek2) deletion. These results demonstrate that Bmi1 has an unexpected role in maintaining mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis and indicate that the Polycomb family of proteins can coordinately regulate cellular metabolism with stem and progenitor cell function. Bmi1 is a member of the Polycomb family of transcriptional repressors that mediate gene silencing by regulating chromatin structure and is essential for the maintenance and self-renewal of both haematopoietic and neural stem cells. Mice lacking Bmi1 are deficient in stem cell self-renewal and thymocyte maturation and have a shortened lifespan. Here Liu et al. demonstrate that cells derived from Bmi1−/− mice also exhibit marked elevation in the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This rise in ROS corresponds to the de-repression of previously identified Polycomb target genes that directly regulate mitochondrial function, metabolism and redox balance. They also show that the rise in ROS within Bmi1−/− tissues is sufficient to engage the DNA damage response pathway. These results demonstrate that Polycomb proteins play an unexpected role in mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis. Mice deficient in the Polycomb repressor Bmi1 have a shortened lifespan and develop numerous abnormalities including defects in stem cell self-renewal and thymocyte maturation. Here it is demonstrated that cells derived from Bmi1−/− mice also show a marked elevation in the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species, corresponding to the derepression of previously identified Polycomb target genes and sufficient to engage the DNA damage response pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2108916750,"An ethogram is a catalogue of discrete behaviors typically employed by a species. Traditionally animal behavior has been recorded by observing study individuals directly. However, this approach is difficult, often impossible, in the case of behaviors which occur in remote areas and/or at great depth or altitude. The recent development of increasingly sophisticated, animal-borne data loggers, has started to overcome this problem. Accelerometers are particularly useful in this respect because they can record the dynamic motion of a body in e.g. flight, walking, or swimming. However, classifying behavior using body acceleration characteristics typically requires prior knowledge of the behavior of free-ranging animals. Here, we demonstrate an automated procedure to categorize behavior from body acceleration, together with the release of a user-friendly computer application, “Ethographer”. We evaluated its performance using longitudinal acceleration data collected from a foot-propelled diving seabird, the European shag, Phalacrocorax aristotelis. The time series data were converted into a spectrum by continuous wavelet transformation. Then, each second of the spectrum was categorized into one of 20 behavior groups by unsupervised cluster analysis, using k-means methods. The typical behaviors extracted were characterized by the periodicities of body acceleration. Each categorized behavior was assumed to correspond to when the bird was on land, in flight, on the sea surface, diving and so on. The behaviors classified by the procedures accorded well with those independently defined from depth profiles. Because our approach is performed by unsupervised computation of the data, it has the potential to detect previously unknown types of behavior and unknown sequences of some behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1991588013,"N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs) are a major class of excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. They form glutamate-gated ion channels that are highly permeable to calcium and mediate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. NMDAR dysfunction is implicated in multiple brain disorders, including stroke, chronic pain and schizophrenia. NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes with distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties that are largely determined by the type of NR2 subunit (NR2A to NR2D) incorporated in the heteromeric NR1/NR2 complex. A fundamental difference between NMDAR subtypes is their channel maximal open probability (P(o)), which spans a 50-fold range from about 0.5 for NR2A-containing receptors to about 0.01 for receptors containing NR2C and NR2D; NR2B-containing receptors have an intermediate value (about 0.1). These differences in P(o) confer unique charge transfer capacities and signalling properties on each receptor subtype. The molecular basis for this profound difference in activity between NMDAR subtypes is unknown. Here we show that the subunit-specific gating of NMDARs is controlled by the region formed by the NR2 amino-terminal domain (NTD), an extracellular clamshell-like domain previously shown to bind allosteric inhibitors, and the short linker connecting the NTD to the agonist-binding domain (ABD). The subtype specificity of NMDAR P(o) largely reflects differences in the spontaneous (ligand-independent) equilibrium between open-cleft and closed-cleft conformations of the NR2-NTD. This NTD-driven gating control also affects pharmacological properties by setting the sensitivity to the endogenous inhibitors zinc and protons. Our results provide a proof of concept for a drug-based bidirectional control of NMDAR activity by using molecules acting either as NR2-NTD 'closers' or 'openers' promoting receptor inhibition or potentiation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2031035517,"Background Flavaglines are a family of natural products from the genus Aglaia that exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo and inhibit translation initiation. They have been shown to modulate the activity of eIF4A, the DEAD-box RNA helicase subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, a complex that stimulates ribosome recruitment during translation initiation. One flavagline, silvestrol, is capable of modulating chemosensitivity in a mechanism-based mouse model. Methodology/Principal Findings Among a number of flavagline family members tested herein, we find that silvestrol is the more potent translation inhibitor among these. We find that silvestrol impairs the ribosome recruitment step of translation initiation by affecting the composition of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex. We show that silvestrol exhibits significant anticancer activity in human breast and prostate cancer xenograft models, and that this is associated with increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and inhibition of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that targeting translation by silvestrol results in preferential inhibition of weakly initiating mRNAs. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that silvestrol is a potent anti-cancer compound in vivo that exerts its activity by affecting survival pathways as well as angiogenesis. We propose that silvestrol mediates its effects by preferentially inhibiting translation of malignancy-related mRNAs. Silvestrol appears to be well tolerated in animals."
https://openalex.org/W2109186438,"The light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex of photosystem II (LHCII) is the most abundant membrane protein in green plants, and its degradation is a crucial process for the acclimation to high light conditions and for the recovery of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) during senescence. However, the molecular mechanism of LHCII degradation is largely unknown. Here, we report that chlorophyll b reductase, which catalyzes the first step of chlorophyll b degradation, plays a central role in LHCII degradation. When the genes for chlorophyll b reductases NOL and NYC1 were disrupted in Arabidopsis thaliana, chlorophyll b and LHCII were not degraded during senescence, whereas other pigment complexes completely disappeared. When purified trimeric LHCII was incubated with recombinant chlorophyll b reductase (NOL), expressed in Escherichia coli, the chlorophyll b in LHCII was converted to 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a. Accompanying this conversion, chlorophylls were released from LHCII apoproteins until all the chlorophyll molecules in LHCII dissociated from the complexes. Chlorophyll-depleted LHCII apoproteins did not dissociate into monomeric forms but remained in the trimeric form. Based on these results, we propose the novel hypothesis that chlorophyll b reductase catalyzes the initial step of LHCII degradation, and that trimeric LHCII is a substrate of LHCII degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2063438481,"Background Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most frequent adult onset motor neuron disease, is associated with hypermetabolism linked to defects in muscle mitochondrial energy metabolism such as ATP depletion and increased oxygen consumption. It remains unknown whether muscle abnormalities in energy metabolism are causally involved in the destruction of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and subsequent motor neuron degeneration during ALS. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied transgenic mice with muscular overexpression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a potent mitochondrial uncoupler, as a model of muscle restricted hypermetabolism. These animals displayed age-dependent deterioration of the NMJ that correlated with progressive signs of denervation and a mild late-onset motor neuron pathology. NMJ regeneration and functional recovery were profoundly delayed following injury of the sciatic nerve and muscle mitochondrial uncoupling exacerbated the pathology of an ALS animal model. Conclusions/Significance These findings provide the proof of principle that a muscle restricted mitochondrial defect is sufficient to generate motor neuron degeneration and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeted at muscle metabolism might prove useful for motor neuron diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2022352188,"EWS-FLI1 is a chimeric ETS transcription factor that is, due to a chromosomal rearrangement, specifically expressed in Ewing's sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) and is thought to initiate the development of the disease. Previous genomic profiling experiments have identified EWS-FLI1-regulated genes and genes that discriminate ESFT from other sarcomas, but so far a comprehensive analysis of EWS-FLI1-dependent molecular functions characterizing this aggressive cancer is lacking.In this study, a molecular function map of ESFT was constructed based on an integrative analysis of gene expression profiling experiments following EWS-FLI1 knockdown in a panel of five ESFT cell lines, and on gene expression data from the same platform of 59 primary ESFT. Out of 80 normal tissues tested, mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC) were found to fit the hypothesis that EWS-FLI1 is the driving transcriptional force in ESFT best and were therefore used as the reference tissue for the construction of the molecular function map. The interrelations of molecular pathways were visualized by measuring the similarity among annotated gene functions by gene sharing. The molecular function map highlighted distinct clusters of activities for EWS-FLI1 regulated genes in ESFT and revealed a striking difference between EWS-FLI1 up- and down-regulated genes: EWS-FLI1 induced genes mainly belong to cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and response to DNA damage, while repressed genes were associated with differentiation and cell communication.This study revealed that EWS-FLI1 combines by distinct molecular mechanisms two important functions of cellular transformation in one protein, growth promotion and differentiation blockage. By taking MPC as a reference tissue, a significant EWS-FLI1 signature was discovered in ESFT that only partially overlapped with previously published EWS-FLI1-dependent gene expression patterns, identifying a series of novel targets for the chimeric protein in ESFT. Our results may guide target selection for future ESFT specific therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2105977974,"Bacteria in the distal human gut have evolved diverse abilities to metabolize complex glycans, including the capacity to degrade these compounds as nutrients and to assemble their component sugars into new polymers such as extracellular capsules. The human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is well endowed with the ability to metabolize both host- and diet-derived glycans. Its genome contains 88 different polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) for complex glycan catabolism and eight different gene clusters for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. Here, we investigate one of the prominent mechanisms by which this gut symbiont regulates many PULs involved in host mucin O-glycan degradation; namely, transcriptional regulation via the concerted interactions of cell-envelope-localized TonB-dependent transporters, extra-cytoplasmic function sigma factors and anti-sigma factors, which participate together in a regulatory pathway termed trans-envelope signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that several different trans-envelope signaling switches involved in PUL-mediated O-glycan degradation also modulate capsular polysaccharide synthesis. A novel regulatory pathway, which is dependent on expression of O-glycan-targeting outer membrane proteins, governs this coordinated regulation of glycan catabolism and capsule synthesis. This latter finding provides a new link in the dynamic interplay between complex glycan metabolism, microbial physiology, and host responses that occurs during colonization of the gut."
https://openalex.org/W2065310958,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can cross the cell membrane and are widely used to deliver bioactive cargoes inside cells. The cargo and the CPP are often conjugated through a disulfide bridge with the common acceptation that this linker is stable in the extracellular biological medium and should not perturb the internalization process. However, with the use of thiol-specific reagents combined with mass spectrometry (as a quantitative method to measure intracellular concentrations of peptides) and confocal microscopy (as a qualitative method to visualize internalized peptides) analyses, we could show that, depending on the peptide sequence, thiol/disulfide exchange reactions could happen at the cell surface. These exchange reactions lead to the reduction of disulfide conjugates. In addition, it was observed that not only disulfide- but also thiol-containing peptides could cross-react with cell-surface thiols. The peptides cross-linked by thiol-containing membrane proteins were either trapped in the membrane or further internalized. Therefore, a new route of cellular uptake was unveiled that is not restricted to CPPs: a protein kinase C peptide inhibitor that is not cell permeant could cross cell membranes when an activated cysteine (with a 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl moiety) was introduced in its sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2047678298,"Background Birth defects are a major public health concern as they are the leading cause of neonatal and infant mortality. Observational studies have linked environmental pollution to adverse birth outcomes, including congenital anomalies. This study examined potential associations between ambient air pollution and congenital heart defects and cleft lip or palate among births in Brisbane, Australia (1998–2004). Methods Ambient air pollution levels were averaged over weeks 3–8 of pregnancy among 150,308 births. Using a case–control design, we used conditional logistic regression and matched cases to 5 controls. Analyses were conducted using all births, and then births where the mother resided within 6 and 12 kilometers of an ambient air quality monitor. Findings When analyzing all births there was no indication that ambient air pollution in Brisbane was associated with a higher risk of cardiac defects. Among births where the mother resided within 6 kilometers of an ambient air quality monitor, a 5 ppb increase in O3 was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary artery and valve defects (OR 2.96, 95% CI: 1.34, 7.52) while a 0.6 ppb increase in SO2 was associated with an increased risk of aortic artery and valve defects (OR 10.76, 95% CI: 1.50, 179.8). For oral cleft defects among all births, the only adverse association was between SO2 and cleft lip with or without cleft palate (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.62). However, various significant inverse associations were also found between air pollutants and birth defects. Conclusions This study found mixed results and it is difficult to conclude whether ambient air pollution in Brisbane has an adverse association with the birth defects examined. Studies using more detailed estimates of air pollution exposure are needed."
https://openalex.org/W1968721371,"Polyphosphate (polyP) is an inorganic polymer built of tens to hundreds of phosphates, linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. PolyP forms complexes and modulates activities of many proteins including ion channels. Here we investigated the role of polyP in the function of the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) channel. Using whole-cell patch-clamp and fluorescent calcium measurements we demonstrate that enzymatic breakdown of polyP by exopolyphosphatase (scPPX1) inhibits channel activity in human embryonic kidney and F-11 neuronal cells expressing TRPM8. We demonstrate that the TRPM8 channel protein is associated with polyP. Furthermore, addition of scPPX1 altered the voltage-dependence and blocked the activity of the purified TRPM8 channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, where the activity of the channel was initiated by cold and menthol in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). The biochemical analysis of the TRPM8 protein also uncovered the presence of poly-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), which is frequently associated with polyP. We conclude that the TRPM8 protein forms a stable complex with polyP and its presence is essential for normal channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W2152467996,"Angiotensin (Ang) II mediates pathophysiologial changes in the kidney. Ang-(1-7) by interacting with the G protein-coupled receptor Mas may also have important biological activities.In this study, renal deficiency for Mas diminished renal damage in models of renal insufficiency as unilateral ureteral obstruction and ischemia/reperfusion injury while the infusion of Ang-(1-7) to wild-type mice pronounced the pathological outcome by aggravating the inflammatory response. Mas deficiency inhibited NF-kappaB activation and thus the elevation of inflammation-stimulating cytokines, while Ang-(1-7) infusion had proinflammatory properties in experimental models of renal failure as well as under basal conditions. The Ang-(1-7)-mediated NF-kappaB activation was Mas dependent but did not involve Ang II receptors. Therefore, the blockade of the NF-kappaB-activating properties of the receptor Mas could be a new strategy in the therapy of failing kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2069072790,"Background Generation of robust cell-mediated immune responses at mucosal surfaces while reducing overall inflammation is a primary goal for vaccination. Here we report the use of a recombinant nanoparticle as a vaccine delivery platform against mucosal infections requiring T cell-mediated immunity for eradication. Methodology/Principal Findings We encapsulated an immunogenic protein, the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of Chlamydia muridarum, within hollow, vault nanocapsules (MOMP-vaults) that were engineered to bind IgG for enhanced immunity. Intranasal immunization (i.n) with MOMP-vaults induced anti-chlamydial immunity plus significantly attenuated bacterial burden following challenge infection. Vault immunization induced anti-chlamydial immune responses and inflammasome formation but did not activate toll-like receptors. Moreover, MOMP-vault immunization enhanced microbial eradication without the inflammation usually associated with adjuvants. Conclusions/Significance Vault nanoparticles containing immunogenic proteins delivered to the respiratory tract by the i.n. route can act as “smart adjuvants” for inducing protective immunity at distant mucosal surfaces while avoiding destructive inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2022004671,"The integrity of the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell is essential for the survival of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Several stressors, including reactive oxygen species, trigger apoptotic damage in RPE cells preceded by an anti-inflammatory, pro-survival response, the formation of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), an oxygenation product derived from the essential omega-3 fatty acid family member docosahexaenoic acid. To define the ability of NPD1 and other endogenous novel lipid mediators in cell survival, we generated a stable knockdown human RPE (ARPE-19) cell line using short hairpin RNA to target 15-lipoxygenase-1. The 15-lipoxygenase-1-deficient cells exhibited 30% of the protein expression, and 15-lipoxygenase-2 remained unchanged, as compared with an ARPE-19 cell line control established using nonspecific short hairpin RNA transfected cells. NPD1 synthesis was stimulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha/H2O2-mediated oxidative stress in nonspecific cells (controls), whereas in silenced cells, negligible amounts of NPD1, 12(S)- and 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and lipoxin A4 were found under these conditions. Neither control nor the deficient cells showed an increase in 15-lipoxygenase-1 protein content after 16 h of oxidative stress, suggesting that the increased activity of 15-lipoxygenase-1 is due to activation of pre-existing proteins. 15-Lipoxygenase-silenced cells also displayed an exacerbated sensitivity to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis when compared with the control cells. NPD1 selectively and potently rescued 15-lipoxygenase-silenced cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that 15-lipoxygenase-1 is activated by oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells and that NPD1 is part of an early survival signaling in RPE cells."
https://openalex.org/W2169500947,"Background The Partners HSV-2/HIV-1 Transmission Study (Partners Study) is a phase III, placebo-controlled trial of daily acyclovir for genital herpes (HSV-2) suppression among HIV-1/HSV-2 co-infected persons to reduce HIV-1 transmission to their HIV-1 susceptible partners, which requires recruitment of HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples. We describe the baseline characteristics of this cohort. Methods HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples, in which the HIV-1 infected partner was HSV-2 seropositive, had a CD4 count ≥250 cells/mcL and was not on antiretroviral therapy, were enrolled at 14 sites in East and Southern Africa. Demographic, behavioral, clinical and laboratory characteristics were assessed. Results Of the 3408 HIV-1 serodiscordant couples enrolled, 67% of the HIV-1 infected partners were women. Couples had cohabitated for a median of 5 years (range 2–9) with 28% reporting unprotected sex in the month prior to enrollment. Among HIV-1 susceptible participants, 86% of women and 59% of men were HSV-2 seropositive. Other laboratory-diagnosed sexually transmitted infections were uncommon (<5%), except for Trichomonas vaginalis in 14% of HIV-1 infected women. Median baseline CD4 count for HIV-1 infected participants was 462cells/mcL and median HIV-1 plasma RNA was 4.2 log10 copies/mL. After adjusting for age and African region, correlates of HIV-1 RNA level included male gender (+0.24 log10 copies/mL; p<0.001) and CD4 count (−0.25 and −0.55 log10 copies/mL for CD4 350–499 and >500 relative to <350, respectively, p<0.001). Conclusions The Partners Study successfully enrolled a cohort of 3408 heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in Africa at high risk for HIV-1 transmission. Follow-up of this cohort will evaluate the efficacy of acyclovir for HSV-2 suppression in preventing HIV-1 transmission and provide insights into biological and behavioral factors determining heterosexual HIV-1 transmission.

https://openalex.org/W2071461710,"The hematopoietic growth factor erythropoietin (EPO) attracts attention due to its all-tissue-protective pleiotropic properties. We studied the effect of EPO on dermal regeneration using intravital microscopy in a model of full dermal thickness wounds in the skin-fold chamber of hairless mice. Animals received repetitive low doses or high doses of EPO (RLD-EPO or RHD-EPO) or a single high dose of EPO (SHD-EPO). SHD-EPO accelerated wound epithelialization, reduced wound cellularity, and induced maturation of newly formed microvascular networks. In contrast, RHD-EPO impaired the healing process, as indicated by delayed epithelialization, high wound cellularity, and lack of maturation of microvascular networks. Also, RHD-EPO caused an excessive erythrocyte mass and rheological malfunction, further deteriorating vessel and tissue maturation. Moreover, RHD-EPO altered fibroblast and keratinocyte migration in vitro, while both cell types exposed to RLD-EPO, and, in particular, to SHD-EPO showed accelerated wound scratch closure. In summary, our data show that a single application of a high dose of EPO accelerates and improves skin wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2005596383,"One of the mechanisms that minimize the aberrant cross-talk between cAMP- and cGMP-dependent signaling pathways relies on the selectivity of cAMP binding domains (CBDs). For instance, the CBDs of two critical eukaryotic cAMP receptors, i.e. protein kinase A (PKA) and the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC), are both selectively activated by cAMP. However, the mechanisms underlying their cAMP versus cGMP selectivity are quite distinct. In PKA this selectivity is controlled mainly at the level of ligand affinity, whereas in EPAC it is mostly determined at the level of allostery. Currently, the molecular basis for these different selectivity mechanisms is not fully understood. We have therefore comparatively analyzed by NMR the cGMP-bound states of the essential CBDs of PKA and EPAC, revealing key differences between them. Specifically, cGMP binds PKA preserving the same syn base orientation as cAMP at the price of local steric clashes, which lead to a reduced affinity for cGMP. Unlike PKA, cGMP is recognized by EPAC in an anti conformation and generates several short and long range perturbations. Although these effects do not alter significantly the structure of the EPAC CBD investigated, remarkable differences in dynamics between the cAMP- and cGMP-bound states are detected for the ionic latch region. These observations suggest that one of the determinants of cGMP antagonism in EPAC is the modulation of the entropic control of inhibitory interactions and illustrate the pivotal role of allostery in determining signaling selectivity as a function of dynamic changes, even in the absence of significant affinity variations."
https://openalex.org/W1976296201,"We investigated the mechanisms of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and fetal ventricular myocytes (hFVMs) using patch-clamp electrophysiology and confocal microscopy. We tested the hypothesis that Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels activates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via a local control mechanism in hESC-CMs and hFVMs. Field-stimulated, whole-cell [Ca2+]i transients in hESC-CMs required Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels, as evidenced by the elimination of such transients by either removal of extracellular Ca2+ or treatment with diltiazem, an L-type channel inhibitor. Ca2+ release from the SR also contributes to the [Ca2+]i transient in these cells, as evidenced by studies with drugs interfering with either SR Ca2+ release (i.e. ryanodine and caffeine) or reuptake (i.e. thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid). As in adult ventricular myocytes, membrane depolarization evoked large L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa) and corresponding whole-cell [Ca2+]i transients in hESC-CMs and hFVMs, and the amplitude of both ICa and the [Ca2+]i transients were finely graded by the magnitude of the depolarization. hESC-CMs exhibit a decreasing EC coupling gain with depolarization to more positive test potentials, “tail” [Ca2+]i transients upon repolarization from extremely positive test potentials, and co-localized ryanodine and sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels, all findings that are consistent with the local control hypothesis. Finally, we recorded Ca2+ sparks in hESC-CMs and hFVMs. Collectively, these data support a model in which tight, local control of SR Ca2+ release by the ICa during EC coupling develops early in human cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1996889334,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) exerts pleiotropic effects during oncogenesis, including the stimulation of cell migration and invasiveness. Although a number of traditional signaling proteins (e.g. Ras and Rho GTPases) have been implicated in EGF-stimulated cancer cell migration, less is known about the identity of those proteins functioning further downstream in this growth factor pathway. Here we have used HeLa carcinoma cells as a model system for investigating the role of tissue transglutaminase (TGase), a protein that has been linked to oncogenesis, in EGF-stimulated cancer cell migration and invasion. Treatment of HeLa cells with EGF resulted in TGase activation and its accumulation at their leading edges, whereas knocking down TGase expression, or treating cells with a TGase inhibitor, blocked EGF-stimulated cell migration and invasion. We show that EGF signaling through Ras and c-Jun N-terminal kinase is responsible for targeting TGase to the leading edges of cells and activating it. The requirement for EGF to properly localize and activate TGase can be circumvented by the expression of oncogenic Ras (G12V), whose ability to stimulate migration is also dependent on TGase. We further show that, in the highly aggressive breast cancer cell line MDAMB231, where EGF stimulation is unnecessary for migration and invasive activity, TGase is already at the leading edge and activated. These findings demonstrate that TGase plays a key role in cancer cell motility and invasiveness and represents a previously unappreciated participant in the EGF pathway that stimulates these processes in cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) exerts pleiotropic effects during oncogenesis, including the stimulation of cell migration and invasiveness.

Upon binding ligand, the EGF receptor becomes activated and initiates a highly regulated series of signaling events, which direct changes in gene transcription and various cellular responses that are vital for proper development and tissue homeostasis (1.Citri A.

In addition to its physiological functions, the EGF receptor has also been intimately associated with oncogenesis. Enhanced EGF receptor signaling, as a result of receptor overexpression and/or an autocrine stimulation of the receptor, is a hallmark of a variety of human tumors (2.Henson E.S. Gibson S.B. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4.Laskin J.J. Sandler A.B. Cancer Treat.

Moreover, high levels of EGF receptor expression detected in brain, breast, pancreatic, and lung tumors are well correlated with poor prognosis, and therapeutic strategies targeting the EGF receptor itself or signaling events initiated by the receptor are currently being used as cancer treatments (4.Laskin J.J.

These findings, coupled with the fact that ectopically expressing the EGF receptor in normal cell types is sufficient to induce ligand-dependent cellular transformation (8.Moscatello D.K. Ramirez G. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1419-1424PubMed Google Scholar), strongly implicate EGF receptor signaling in cancer development. Thus, it is not surprising that a good deal of effort continues to be devoted toward understanding how EGF receptor activation gives rise to malignant transformation.Exposing cancer cells to EGF can elicit or potentiate a host of phenotypes consistent with the oncogenic or transformed state. These include the excessive stimulation of cell cycle progression, protection against the apoptotic responses triggered by chemotherapy, and enhanced cell motility and invasive activity (8.Moscatello D.K.

Of particular interest has been to better understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ability of cancer cells to migrate and/or invade in response to EGF, because tumor cells that exhibit these traits are thought to have acquired an aggressive phenotype. By studying the actions of EGF in cancer cells, it is expected that new insights will be gained regarding the signaling events that are responsible for the development of highly aggressive tumors.EGF-induced cell motility involves a multistep, cyclic process that integrates a highly coordinated activation and distribution of signaling molecules within cells with rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane (11.Sahai E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The cumulative effect of this process is the establishment of a polarized cellular morphology, where actin polymerization drives membrane protrusions at the front or leading edge of the cell followed by actin bundling and cell contraction at the rear. A few of the more extensively investigated signaling molecules that have been implicated in mediating the EGF-induced migration of cancer cells include members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ (12.Hill K. Welti S. Yu J. Murray J.T. Yip S.C. Condeelis J.S. Segall J.E. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3741-3744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13.Piccolo E.

Extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and JNK, two members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which are best known for stimulating cell growth and differentiation (3.Katz M. Amit I. Yarden Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1161-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), represent additional examples of signaling molecules that are also becoming appreciated for their roles in promoting cancer cell motility (15.Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). For instance, interfering with the ability of EGF to stimulate ERK activity using the MEK inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 was shown to block the EGF-stimulated migration of LIM1215 colon cancer cells, as well as A549 lung carcinoma cells (16.Hauck C.R.

Cell Res. 2001; 266: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Likewise, incubating the breast carcinoma cell line MDAMB468 with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 rendered these cells insensitive to the migration-promoting actions of EGF (18.Cui X. Kim H.J. Kuiatse I. Kim H. Brown P.H. Lee A.V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5304-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although these findings collectively highlight the importance of Ras and Rho-family GTPases, and the MAPKs ERK and JNK, as playing significant roles in the EGF-signaling pathways stimulating cancer cell motility, there remains to be identified those proteins that are acting further downstream from this growth factor at the level of the leading edge and/or the cytoskeleton.One candidate of potential interest is TGase, a unique multifunctional protein that exhibits an ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP, as well as catalyze an enzymatic transamidation reaction that results in the formation of covalent cross-links between two proteins or a protein and a polyamine (19.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). What makes this protein an interesting candidate to consider is that the overexpression and/or activation of TGase have been reported in highly aggressive and chemo-insensitive human brain, breast, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors (20.Hwang J.Y. Mangala L.S. Fok J.Y. Lin Y.G. Merritt W.M. Spannuth W.A. Nick A.M. Fiterman D.J. Vivas-Mejia P.E. Deavers M.T. Coleman R.L. Lopez-Berestein G. Mehta K. Sood A.K.

Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2563-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, ectopically expressing TGase in the SKBR3 breast cancer cell line was sufficient to confer a survival advantage to these cells when challenged with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (24.Antonyak M.A. Miller A.M. Jansen J.M. Boehm J.E. Balkman C.E. Wakshlag J.J. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41461-41467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Likewise, both the invasive and drug-resistant phenotypes of MDAMB231 breast carcinoma cells could be suppressed when the chronic TGase activity associated with these cells was inhibited by either knocking down TGase expression using RNAi or by incubating the cells with the TGase inhibitor monodansylcadaverine (MDC) (24.Antonyak M.A. Miller A.M.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 10936-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).Given these potential connections between TGase and different aspects of cancer progression, we investigated the possibility that it might be playing a role in the EGF-signaling pathways that contribute to cancer cell migration and invasiveness, using the human cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line as a model for studying these processes. We found that treating HeLa cells with EGF caused TGase to accumulate at the leading edges of migrating cells, as well as activated both its GTP-binding and transamidation activities. Introducing TGase-specific siRNAs into cells, or inhibiting the transamidation activity of TGase with MDC, blocked the ability of EGF to promote HeLa cell migration and invasion, indicating that TGase is in fact an essential participant in the EGF-signaling pathway responsible for these activities. We further determined that EGF can work through Ras and JNK to localize TGase to the leading edges of cells and to activate it. To our knowledge, these data indicate for the first time that EGF-promoted tumor cell aggressiveness is tightly coupled to its ability to activate TGase, and in particular demonstrate that TGase plays an essential role in the ability of EGF to stimulate cancer cell migration and invasive activity.DiscussionDetermining the molecular mechanisms responsible for the aggressive phenotype of human cancer cells is particularly important, not only for furthering our understanding of cancer progression, but also for the development of novel intervention points for cancer therapies. One of the hallmark characteristics of malignant transformation is the ability of growth factors like EGF to stimulate cell migration and invasiveness (10.Katz M. Amit I. Citri A. Shay T. Carvalho S. Lavi S. Milanezi F. Lyass L. Amariglio N. Jacob-Hirsch J. Ben-Chetrit N. Tarcic G. Lindzen M. Avraham R. Liao Y.C. Trusk P. Lyass A. Rechavi G. Spector N.L. Lo S.H. Schmitt F. Bacus S.S. Yarden Y.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). We have used the cervical carcinoma HeLa cell line as a model to identify participants in these EGF-stimulated activities. Here we show that TGase is one such protein that plays an essential role in the ability of EGF to stimulate HeLa cell migration and invasive activity. The initial indication that this was the case came from our findings that treating HeLa cells with EGF led to the activation of the GTP-binding and enzymatic transamidation activities of TGase, as well as the accumulation of TGase along the leading edges of actively migrating cells. We then showed that by either knocking down TGase expression in HeLa cells or by using MDC, a competitive transamidation inhibitor that binds at the active site of TGase, EGF was no longer capable of stimulating cell migration or invasion. Interestingly, although ectopically expressed TGase in HeLa cells exhibits both GTP-binding and transamidation activities, it is unable to mimic the actions of EGF and trigger a cell migration response. Thus, TGase activation is necessary but not sufficient for mediating the aggressive behavior exhibited by EGF-treated HeLa cells. Indeed, the EGF-stimulated recruitment of TGase to the leading edges of cells is likely to be an important step, along with TGase activation, in the ability of this growth factor to promote cell migration and invasive activity.Certainly, a question of interest concerned how EGF signals the activation and recruitment of TGase to the leading edges of cells. Based on previous work where we demonstrated that the up-regulation of TGase expression and the activation of its GTP-binding and transamidation activities in various cell lineages stimulated with RA and/or EGF were dependent on PI3K activity (24.Antonyak M.A. Miller A.M. Jansen J.M. Boehm J.E. Balkman C.E. Wakshlag J.J. Page R.L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41461-41467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35.Antonyak M.A. Boehm J.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we anticipated that PI3K would play a similar role in the EGF-mediated regulation of TGase function in HeLa cells. However, blocking PI3K activity with LY294002 did not affect the ability of EGF to stimulate TGase activation in HeLa cells. Rather, we found that EGF-dependent signaling to JNK, a member of the MAPK family, is essential for the activation of TGase as well as its recruitment to the leading edge, and consequently for EGF-stimulated cell migration. The role of JNK in EGF signaling to TGase appears to be highly specific, because inhibitors of several other signaling molecules, including other members of the MAPK family (i.e. ERK and p38), were ineffective at blocking EGF-induced TGase activity or its recruitment to the leading edges of cells. It is especially interesting that the same EGF-signaling pathway is responsible for both of these aspects of TGase regulation. This raises the possibility that the EGF-dependent accumulation of TGase at the leading edges of cells and the EGF-stimulated activation of TGase, are coupled events. It may be that TGase is maintained in an “inactive” conformational state, perhaps through some type of regulatory interaction with a binding partner while in the cytosol, but that EGF-dependent signals that recruit TGase to the cell surface also relieve this inhibitory constraint. It seems likely that EGF works through Ras to signal to JNK and regulate TGase function, as cells expressing oncogenic Ras can by-pass the need for EGF stimulation to recruit TGase to the leading edges of cells and activate its GTP-binding and enzymatic activities. Moreover, the requirement for EGF stimulation can be circumvented in MDAMB231 cells, where TGase exhibits constitutive activation and accumulation at their leading edges, and correspondingly, these cells are highly motile and invasive even in the absence of growth factor treatment.We still do not fully understand how EGF signaling through Ras and JNK brings TGase to the leading edges of cells, although we assume it is the outcome of a JNK-catalyzed phosphorylation event, nor is it yet clear how TGase plays an essential role in EGF-stimulated cell migration and invasiveness. Such questions have also been challenging to answer for other proteins shown to accumulate at the leading edges of migrating cells upon their exposure to different extracellular stimuli and signaling cues (11.Sahai E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 14.Yip S.C. El-Sibai M. Coniglio S.J. Mouneimne G. Eddy R.J. Drees B.E. Neilsen P.O. Goswami S. Symons M. Condeelis J.S.

The EGF-stimulated recruitment of TGase to the leading edges of migrating HeLa cells may bring it into close proximity to a specific protein transamidation substrate or a set of protein substrates that need to be cross-linked in order for cell motility to occur. Although a number of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins have been identified in screens as putative TGase substrates (19.Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), we have not yet been able to implicate any of these potential substrates in the TGase-dependent cell migration response in cancer cells. However, recently we have obtained a potentially interesting clue regarding how TGase might play a role in cell migration, stemming from the finding that it can form a stable complex with actin as measured by the co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins from HeLa cells as well as from certain human breast cancer cell lines. 3B. Li and M. Antonyak, unpublished data. What is particularly intriguing about these findings is that while wild-type TGase is capable of forming a stable complex with actin, a transamidation-defective form of TGase in which the active-site cysteine residue has been changed to valine, is unable to be co-immunoprecipitated with actin. Although we have demonstrated that actin can act as a transamidation substrate of TGase in vitro, as indicated by the appearance of higher molecular weight (cross-linked) forms of actin when recombinant forms of actin and TGase are combined in the presence of Ca2+, we have found no indication that actin is similarly modified by TGase, either in migrating HeLa or MDAMB231 cells (data not shown). Moreover, the fact that the enzymatically competent form of TGase undergoes stable complex formation with actin, would seem to argue against actin serving as a transamidation substrate, otherwise once it was cross-linked to an acceptor protein, it would be expected to dissociate from TGase (i.e. the typical product release from an enzyme). Thus, these findings seem to suggest that the enzyme active site of TGase might be involved in directly binding to actin, perhaps enabling TGase to serve as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins that influence actin polymerization or other effects on actin dynamics in cells. Future efforts will be directed at further examining this intriguing possibility.Increasing amounts of recent evidence have linked TGase to human cancer progression. For example, TGase overexpression and/or its aberrant activation have been noted in a significant percentage of the more aggressive brain, breast, prostate, ovarian, and pancreatic tumors and tumor-derived cell lines (20.Hwang J.Y.

Moreover, inhibiting the chronic TGase activity found in some of these cancer cell lines (e.g. MDAMB231 cells) by either knocking down TGase expression using RNAi or incubating the cells with TGase inhibitors, has been shown here and in other studies to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic challenges, as well as limit their aggressive behavior (20.Hwang J.Y.

Upon binding ligand, the EGF receptor becomes activated and initiates a highly regulated series of signaling events, which direct changes in gene transcription and various cellular responses that are vital for proper development and tissue homeostasis (1.Citri A.

In addition to its physiological functions, the EGF receptor has also been intimately associated with oncogenesis. Enhanced EGF receptor signaling, as a result of receptor overexpression and/or an autocrine stimulation of the receptor, is a hallmark of a variety of human tumors (2.Henson E.S. Gibson S.B. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1982740705,"Background Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the foremost cause of cancer-related death in Western countries, which is due partly to the propensity of NSCLC cells to metastasize. The biologic basis for NSCLC metastasis is not well understood. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we addressed this deficiency by transcriptionally profiling tumors from a genetic mouse model of human lung adenocarcinoma that develops metastatic disease owing to the expression of K-rasG12D and p53R172H. We identified 2,209 genes that were differentially expressed in distant metastases relative to matched lung tumors. Mining of publicly available data bases revealed this expression signature in a subset of NSCLC patients who had a poorer prognosis than those without the signature. Conclusions/Significance These findings provide evidence that K-rasG12D; p53R172H mice recapitulate features of human NSCLC metastasis and will provide a useful platform on which to study the biologic basis for lung adenocarcinoma metastasis and its prevention by novel agents."
https://openalex.org/W1977100656,"Background Neutrophils polarize and migrate in response to chemokines. Different types of membrane microdomains (rafts) have been postulated to be present in rear and front of polarized leukocytes and disruption of rafts by cholesterol sequestration prevents leukocyte polarization. Reggie/flotillin-1 and -2 are two highly homologous proteins that are ubiquitously enriched in detergent resistant membranes and are thought to shape membrane microdomains by forming homo- and hetero-oligomers. It was the goal of this study to investigate dynamic membrane microdomain reorganization during neutrophil activation. Methodology/Principal Findings We show now, using immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation, that endogenous flotillin-1 and -2 colocalize and associate in resting spherical and polarized primary neutrophils. Flotillins redistribute very early after chemoattractant stimulation, and form distinct caps in more than 90% of the neutrophils. At later time points flotillins accumulate in the uropod of polarized cells. Chemotactic peptide-induced redistribution and capping of flotillins requires integrity and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton, but does not involve Rho-kinase dependent signaling related to formation of the uropod. Both flotillin isoforms are involved in the formation of this membrane domain, as uropod location of exogenously expressed flotillins is dramatically enhanced by co-overexpression of tagged flotillin-1 and -2 in differentiated HL-60 cells as compared to cells expressing only one tagged isoform. Flotillin-1 and -2 associate with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) in resting and in stimulated neutrophils as shown by colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation. Neutrophils isolated from PSGL-1-deficient mice exhibit flotillin caps to the same extent as cells isolated from wild type animals, implying that PSGL-1 is not required for the formation of the flotillin caps. Finally we show that stimulus-dependent redistribution of other uropod-located proteins, CD43 and ezrin/radixin/moesin, occurs much slower than that of flotillins and PSGL-1. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that flotillin-rich actin-dependent membrane microdomains are importantly involved in neutrophil uropod formation and/or stabilization and organize uropod localization of PSGL-1."
https://openalex.org/W2034226010,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. Its rapid onset and resistance to conventional therapeutics contribute to a mean survival of six months after diagnosis and make the identification of thyroid-cancer-initiating cells increasingly important.In prior studies of ATC cell lines, CD133(+) cells exhibited stem-cell-like features such as high proliferation, self-renewal and colony-forming ability in vitro. Here we show that transplantation of CD133(+) cells, but not CD133(-) cells, into immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice is sufficient to induce growth of tumors in vivo. We also describe how the proportion of ATC cells that are CD133(+) increases dramatically over three months of culture, from 7% to more than 80% of the total. This CD133(+) cell pool can be further separated by flow cytometry into two distinct populations: CD133(+/high) and CD133(+/low). Although both subsets are capable of long-term tumorigenesis, the rapidly proliferating CD133(+/high) cells are by far the most efficient. They also express high levels of the stem cell antigen Oct4 and the receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone, TSHR. Treating ATC cells with TSH causes a three-fold increase in the numbers of CD133(+) cells and elicits a dose-dependent up-regulation of the expression of TSHR and Oct4 in these cells. More importantly, immunohistochemical analysis of tissue specimens from ATC patients indicates that CD133 is highly expressed on tumor cells but not on neighboring normal thyroid cells.To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that CD133(+) ATC cells are solely responsible for tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. Our data also give a unique insight into the regulation of CD133 by TSH. These highly tumorigenic CD133(+) cells and the activated TSH signaling pathway may be useful targets for future ATC therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2066545366,"Background We tested the relevance of clinical information in the histopathologic evaluation of melanocytic skin neoplasm (MSN). Methods Histopathologic specimens from 99 clinically atypical MSN were circulated among ten histopathologists; each case had clinical information available in a database with a five-step procedure (no information; age/sex/location; clinical diagnosis; clinical image; dermoscopic image); each step had a histopathologic diagnosis (D1 through D5); each diagnostic step had a level of diagnostic confidence (LDC) ranging from 1 (no diagnostic certainty) to 5 (absolute diagnostic certainty). The comparison of the LDC was employed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. Findings In D1 (no information), 36/99 cases (36.3%) had unanimous diagnosis; in D5 (full information available), 51/99 cases (51.5%) had unanimous diagnosis (p for difference between proportions <0.001). The observer agreement expressed as kappa increased significantly from D1 to D5. The mean LDC linearly increased for each observer from D1 through D5 (p for linear trend <0.001). On average, each histopathologist changed his initial diagnosis in 7 cases (range: 2–23). Most diagnostic changes were in D2 (age/sex/location). Interpretation The histopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of MSN can work as such, but the final histopathologic diagnosis is a clinically-aided interpretation. Clinical data sometimes reverse the initial histopathologic evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2070692447,"Background Two related merozoite surface proteins, MSP3 and MSP6, have previously been identified as targets of antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI), a protective mechanism against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Both MSP3 and MSP6 share a common characteristic small N-terminal signature amino-acid stretch (NLRNA/G), a feature similar to MSP3-like orthologs identified in other human and primate malaria parasites. Methods/Results This signature amino-acid sequence led to the identification of eight ORFs contiguously located on P. falciparum chromosome 10. Our subsequent investigations on their expression, localization, sequence conservation, epitope sharing, immunogenicity and the functional role of antibodies in defense are reported here. Six members of P. falciparum MSP3-multigene family share similar sequence organization within their C-terminal regions, are simultaneously expressed as merozoite surface proteins and are highly conserved among parasite isolates. Each of these proteins is a target of naturally occurring antibodies effective at parasite killing in ADCI assays. Moreover, both naturally occurring antibodies and those generated by immunization display cross-reactivity with other members of the family and exhibit varied binding avidities. Conclusions/Significance The unusual characteristics of the MSP3 multi-gene family lead us to hypothesize that the simultaneous expression of targets eliciting cross-reactive antibody responses capable of controlling parasite densities could represent an immune process selected through evolution to maintain homeostasis between P. falciparum and human hosts; a process that allows the continuous transmission of the parasite without killing the host. Our observations also have practical consequences for vaccine development by suggesting MSP3 vaccine efficacy might be improved when combined with the various C-terminus regions of the MSP3 family members to generate a wider range of antibodies acting and to increase vaccine immunogenicity in varied human genetic backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W1989969636,"The Sp4 transcription factor plays a critical role for both development and function of mouse hippocampus. Reduced expression of the mouse Sp4 gene results in a variety of behavioral abnormalities relevant to human psychiatric disorders. The human SP4 gene is therefore examined for its association with both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in European Caucasian and Chinese populations respectively. Out of ten SNPs selected from human SP4 genomic locus, four displayed significant association with bipolar disorder in European Caucasian families (rs12668354, p = 0.022; rs12673091, p = 0.0005; rs3735440, p = 0.019; rs11974306, p = 0.018). To replicate the genetic association, the same set of SNPs was examined in a Chinese bipolar case control sample. Four SNPs displayed significant association (rs40245, p = 0.009; rs12673091, p = 0.002; rs1018954, p = 0.001; rs3735440, p = 0.029), and two of them (rs12673091, rs3735440) were shared with positive SNPs from European Caucasian families. Considering the genetic overlap between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, we extended our studies in Chinese trios families for schizophrenia. The SNP7 (rs12673091, p = 0.012) also displayed a significant association. The SNP7 (rs12673091) was therefore significantly associated in all three samples, and shared the same susceptibility allele (A) across all three samples. On the other hand, we found a gene dosage effect for mouse Sp4 gene in the modulation of sensorimotor gating, a putative endophenotype for both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The deficient sensorimotor gating in Sp4 hypomorphic mice was partially reversed by the administration of dopamine D2 antagonist or mood stabilizers. Both human genetic and mouse pharmacogenetic studies support Sp4 gene as a susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The studies on the role of Sp4 gene in hippocampal development may provide novel insights for the contribution of hippocampal abnormalities in these psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2046412886,"Sulfated polysaccharides from the egg jelly of sea urchins act as species-specific inducers of the sperm acrosome reaction, which is a rare molecular mechanism of carbohydrate-induced signal-transduction event in animal cells. The sea urchin polysaccharides differ in monosaccharide composition (l-fucose or l-galactose), glycosylation, and sulfation sites, but they are always in the α-anomeric configuration. Herein, structural analysis of the polysaccharide from the sea urchin Glyptocidaris crenularis surprisingly revealed a unique sulfated β-d-galactan composed by (3-β-d-Galp-2(OSO3)-1→3-β-d-Galp-1)n repeating units. Subsequently, we used the G. crenularis galactan to compare different 2-sulfated polysaccharides as inducers of the acrosome reaction using homologous and heterologous sperm. We also tested the effect of chemically over-sulfated galactans. Intriguingly, the anomeric configuration of the glycosidic linkage rather than the monosaccharide composition (galactose or fucose) is the preferential structural requirement for the effect of these polysaccharides on sea urchin fertilization. Nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics indicate that sulfated α-galactan or α-fucan have less dynamic structural behavior, exhibiting fewer conformational populations, with an almost exclusive conformational state with glycosidic dihedral angles Φ/Ψ = −102°/131°. The preponderant conformer observed in the sulfated α-galactan or α-fucan is not observed among populations in the β-form despite its more flexible structure in solution.

Possibly, a proper spatial arrangement is required for interaction of the sea urchin-sulfated polysaccharides with the specific sperm receptor. The evolution of barriers to inter-specific hybridization is a crucial step in the fertilization of free-spawning marine invertebrates. In sea urchins the molecular recognition between sperm and egg ensures species recognition. The jelly coat surrounding sea urchin eggs is not a simple accessory structure; it is considerably complex on a molecular level and intimately involved in gamete recognition. It contains sulfated polysaccharides, sialoglycans, and peptides. Structural changes in the sulfated polysaccharide from the egg jelly of sea urchins modulate cell-cell recognition and species specificity leading to exocytosis of the acrosomal vesicle, the acrosome reaction. This is a crucial event for the recognition between male and female gametes, leading to the fertilization success, and is also what prevents intercrosses. The sulfated polysaccharide from the egg jelly recognizes its specific receptor present in the sperm. Apart from the sialoglycans that act in synergy with the sulfated polysaccharides, other components of the egg jelly do not possess acrosome reaction-inducing activity (1.Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8041-8047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The sulfated polysaccharide-mediated mechanism of sperm-egg recognition co-exists with that of bindin and its receptor in the egg (2.Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1977; 74: 2456-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 3.Biermann C.H. Marks J.A. Vilela-Silva A.C. Castro M.O. Mourão P.A.S. Evol.

The sulfated polysaccharides from sea urchin show species-specific structures composed of repetitive units (mono-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides) that differ in the monosaccharide backbone (l-fucose or l-galactose), glycosidic linkage (3- or 4-linked), and sulfation (2- and/or 4-sulfation). However, they are always in the α-enantiomeric configuration (4.Vilela-Silva A.C. Hirohashi N. Mourão P.A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2008; 52: 551-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5.Mourão P.A.S. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2007; 40: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that sea urchin-sulfated polysaccharides induce the acrosome reaction in a species-specific way. In some cases the sperm from a certain species of sea urchin recognizes the sulfated polysaccharide containing a similar structure from a different species. For example, the egg jelly from Strongylocentrotus franciscanus contains a 2-sulfated, 3-linked α-fucan, but the sperm from this species recognizes a heterologous 2-sulfated, 3-linked α-galactan from Echinometra lucunter (6.Hirohashi N. Vilela-Silva A.C. Mourão P.A. Vacquier V.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We now extended our studies to the sulfated polysaccharides of the sea urchin Glyptocidaris crenularis (7.Hirai E. Sci. Rep. Tôhoku Univ. Ser. IV (Biol.). 1963; 29: 369-375Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed that this species contains a unique sulfated β-d-galactan composed of repetitive disaccharide units alternating 2-sulfated and non-sulfated 3-linked units. This polymer is markedly distinct from all other sea urchin-sulfated polysaccharides described so far that are composed of units on α-l-configuration. Furthermore, this sea urchin does not contain sialoglycans, which are commonly found in the echinoderm egg jelly. We used this new sulfated β-galactan to investigate the acrosome reaction in a further molecular detail using homologous and heterologous sperm. We tested three 2-sulfated polysaccharides that differ in their conformation (α or β) and monosaccharide composition (galactose or fucose) as inducers of the sperm acrosome reaction. We aimed to establish the structure versus biological activity of the echinoderm polysaccharides, including structural features at a conformational level. Mature females of G. crenularis were harvested by dredging in Noheji Bay, Japan. Eggs were spawned into sea water by intracelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl. The crude egg jelly was isolated by pouring eggs repeatedly through nylon mesh, prepared as a 30,000 × g supernatant, and stored at −20 °C, lyophilized, and dialyzed against distilled water (8.Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The acidic polysaccharides were extracted from the jelly coat by papain digestion and partially purified by ethanol precipitation, as described previously (9.Albano R.M. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 758-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 20 mg of the crude polysaccharides from G. crenularis was applied to a Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column (HR5/5; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and coupled to a FPLC system. The column was washed with 10 ml of the same solution and then eluted with a linear gradient of 0–3 m NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected at a flow rate of 0.45 ml/min and checked for hexose (10.Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40868) Google Scholar), sialic acid (11.Kabat E.A. Mayer M.M. Experimental Immunochemistry. Charles C. Thomas Publisher, Springfield, IL1971: 505-513Google Scholar), and metachromatic property (12.Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2904) Google Scholar). The NaCl concentration was estimated by conductivity. Fractions were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water, and lyophilized. After acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide (5.0 m trifluoroacetic acid for 5 h at 100 °C), sulfate was measured by the BaCl2/gelatin method (13.Saito H. Yamagata T. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of hexoses and 6-deoxyhexoses in the acid hydrolysates was estimated by paper chromatography in 1-butanol/pyridine/water (3:2:1, v/v) for 48 h. In addition, alditol acetate derivatives were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (14.Kircher H.W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1103-1106Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The enantiomeric form of the galactose was assigned based on the analysis of the acetylated (−)-2-butyl glycoside, as described (15.Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Galactose obtained after acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide from G. crenularis (1 mg, see above) was mixed with 0.5 ml of (−)-2-butanol (Aldrich) containing 1 m HCl. After butanolysis for 18 h at 80 °C, the solution was neutralized with Ag2CO3, and the supernatant was concentrated and dissolved in 50 μl of distilled water. Thereafter, alditol acetate derivative was prepared (14.Kircher H.W. Anal. Chem. 1960; 32: 1103-1106Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a DB-5 GLC column. The temperature of the column was programmed to increase in a linear gradient of 120 to 240 °C at 2 °C/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 260 °C, respectively. Appropriate controls of acetylated (−)-2-butyl-d- and l-galactosides were analyzed under the same conditions. The sulfated galactan was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, as described previously (16.Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6965-6971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). About 15 μg of the purified sulfated polysaccharide was applied to a 0.5% agarose gel and run for 1 h at 110 V in 0.05 m 1,3-diaminopropane acetate (pH 9.0). The sulfated polysaccharides in the gel were fixed with 0.1% N-cetyl-N,N,N-trymethylammonium bromide solution. After 12 h, the gel was dried and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in acetic acid:ethanol:water (0.1:5:5, v/v). The average molecular mass of the sulfated galactan was estimated by comparison with the electrophoretic mobility of standard compounds (18.Pomin V.H. Pereira M.S. Valente A.P. Tollefsen D.M. Pavão M.S. Mourão P.A.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The sulfated polysaccharides (∼10 μg of each) were applied to a 1-mm-thick 10% polyacrylamide slab gel in 0.02 m sodium barbital (pH 8.6). After electrophoresis (100 V for 30 min), the sulfated polysaccharides were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue in 1% acetic acid and washed for about 1 h in 1% acetic acid. Desulfation of the sulfated galactan was performed as described previously (16.Vieira R.P. Mulloy B. Mourão P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13530-13536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Mourão P.A.S. Perlin A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). About 20 mg of the polysaccharide was dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water and mixed with 1 g (dry weight) of Dowex 50-W (H+, 200–400 mesh). After neutralization with pyridine, the solution was lyophilized. The resulting pyridinium salt was dissolved in 2.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (9:1, v/v). The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 4 h, and the desulfated product was exhaustively dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. The extent of desulfation was estimated by the molar ratio of sulfate/total sugar. This method allowed us to detect desulfation up to a molar ratio of ≤0.1 sulfate/total sugar. About 5 mg of desulfated polysaccharide was obtained at the end of the reaction. Over-sulfated galactans were prepared through chemical sulfonation of the native polysaccharides (6.Hirohashi N. Vilela-Silva A.C. Mourão P.A. Vacquier V.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In a control reaction we followed sulfonation of chondroitin 4-sulfate. The reaction reached about 72.1% of the total sites available for sulfation on the entire chondroitin sulfate backbone, as indicated by NMR analysis. It was not possible to run NMR spectra of the over-sulfated galactans due to scarce material. 1H and 13C one- and two-dimensional spectra of the native sulfated galactan and of its desulfated derivative were recorded using a Bruker DRX 400 MHz apparatus with a triple resonance probe, as detailed previously (18.Pomin V.H. Pereira M.S. Valente A.P. Tollefsen D.M. Pavão M.S. Mourão P.A.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). About 5 mg of each sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 99.9% deuterium oxide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Cambridge, MA). All spectra were recorded at 50 °C with HOD suppression by presaturation.

Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4287) Google Scholar), and the initial geometries and crude topologies were retrieved. These topologies were supplied with Löwdin HF/6–31G** atomic charges (23.Verli H. Guimarães J.A. Carbohydr. Res. 2004; 339: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24.Becker C.F.

The minimum energy conformations described in these plots were submitted to 0.1 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in aqueous solutions using the SPC water model (26.Berendsen H.J. Grigera J.R.

A triclinic water box under periodic boundary conditions was employed using a 10-Å minimum distance from solute to the box faces. Counter ions (Na+) were added to neutralize the system. The Lincs method (28.Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Fraaije J.G. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11731) Google Scholar) was applied to constraint covalent bond lengths, allowing an integration step of 2 fs after an initial energy minimization using the Steepest Descents algorithm. All simulations applied the Particle-Mesh Ewald method (29.Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21040) Google Scholar). Temperature and pressure were kept constant by coupling carbohydrate, ions, and solvent to external temperature and pressure baths with coupling constants of t = 0.1 and 0.5 ps, respectively (26.Berendsen H.J. Grigera J.R. Straatsma T.P. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 6269-6271Crossref Scopus (10407) Google Scholar). The reference temperature was adjusted to 310 K. The relative orientation of a pair of contiguous carbohydrate residues is described by two torsional angles at the glycosidic linkage, denoted ϕ and ψ, as follows: ϕ = O-5-C-1-O-1-C-3′, and ψ = C-1-O-1-C-3′-C-2′. G. crenularis sperm were collected as undiluted semen, stored on ice, and diluted in ice-chilled seawater shortly before use. Sulfated galactans (20 μl) were dissolved in sea water at the final concentration of 4 mg/ml and placed in a test tube. Thereafter, 100-fold diluted sperm suspension (5 μl) was added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Unfertilized G. crenularis eggs spawned by intercelomic injection with 0.5 m KCl were placed in a 48-well culture dish filled with 150 μl of seawater. After a 10-min incubation of sperm with sulfated galactan, such sperm (5 μl) were inseminated for 30 min at 20 °C. The percentage of fertilization (judged by the presence/absence of the fertilization envelope) was scored under the microscope by counting ∼200 eggs. Three independent experiments were performed. The method used to access the acrosome reaction was slightly modified from Su and Vacquier (30.Su Y.H. Vacquier V.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm were spawned by intracelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl (0.5 ml/animal), collected undiluted, and stored on ice before dilution. They were diluted 1:5 in 10 mm HEPES-buffered sea water (pH 7.9). Immediately after dilution, ∼25 μl of the sperm suspension were mixed with 50 μl of the polysaccharide solution. The sugar content of these solutions was previously quantified by the phenol-sulfuric acid assay (10.Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40868) Google Scholar). After 5 min on ice, sperm were fixed in 350 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde in seawater for 30 min, washed 2 times with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and stained for at least 2 h with 1 unit of rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes R415, Invitrogen) in 50 μl of 0.1 m glycine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). The solution was then washed twice in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 30 μl of 4′6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 6 min. The cells were washed twice in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and then re-suspended in 30 μl of 70% glyceraldehyde in the same solution and mounted in a thin layer, and the coverslip was sealed. Sperm were scored blindly using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus fluorescent microscope. Photos were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Jeha, Germany) in red (phalloidin), blue (4′6′-diamino-2-phenylindole), and transmitted light channels. Intracellular calcium was measured by a methodology slightly modified from Hirohashi and Vacquier (8.Hirohashi N. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1182-1189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm from E. lucunter were collected on ice and in darkness and immediately used. Undiluted semen was suspended in 4 volumes of dye loading buffer (artificial sea water containing 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor at pH 7.0), placed in dimethyl sulfoxide (final concentration 0.6%) containing fura-2/AM at a final concentration of 12 μm, and incubated for 4 h in darkness at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and grounded at 430 × g for 5 min. The final pellet was resuspended in fresh dye loading buffer without soybean trypsin inhibitor. Finally, 50 μl of fura-2-loaded sperm were placed in an 11-mm-diameter glass tube containing 1.5 ml of dye loading buffer without soybean trypsin inhibitor and mounted in a FP-6300 spectrofluorimeter from Jasco at 16 °C at continual agitation. The fluorescence intensity was measured at Ex/Em 340/500 nm to follow the effect of the sulfated polysaccharide in the sperm. The sugar content of the polysaccharide solutions was quantified by the phenol-sulfuric acid assay (10.Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (40868) Google Scholar). The polysaccharides extracted from the egg jelly of G. crenularis were purified by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column coupled to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, and fractions were monitored for hexose and metachromasia (Fig. 1A). We observed a single peak of sulfated polysaccharide, eluted from the column with ∼1.3 M NaCl, as indicated by the hexose assay (closed circles in Fig. 1A) and metachromasia (open circles).

After derivatization with butyl alcohol, the galactoside derivatives obtained showed the same retention times and peak areas as d-galactose standard, indicating that the galactose occurs in the G. crenularis exclusively in the d-enantiomeric form. Thus, the egg jelly of the sea urchin G. crenularis contains a single fraction of sulfated d-galactan. It differs from the sulfated polysaccharides found in other species of sea urchins that contain fucose or galactose always in the l-configuration (17.Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Diniz J.A. Mourão P.A.S. J.

For a detailed structural analysis of the sulfated galactan from G. crenularis, we employed one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy of the native polysaccharide and of its desulfated derivative (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). The 1H one-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 2A) and mainly the 13C,1H HSQC spectrum (Fig. 3A) of the native sulfated galactan showed equimolar proportions of two anomeric signals, denominated as A1 and B1. A1 exhibited a downfield shift of ∼0.2 ppm, possibly because of sulfation (34.Pomin V.H. Valente A.P. Pereira M.S. Mourão P.A. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1376-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reinforced by analysis of the 13C,1H HSQC spectrum of the native polysaccharide (Fig. 3A) and the disappearance of signal A1 after the desulfation reaction (Figs. 2B and 3B). These observations suggest that the sulfated galactan from G. crenularis contains equimolar proportions of non-sulfated and sulfated galactoses.FIGURE 313C,1H HSQC spectra of the sulfated β-galactan from G. crenularis (A) and its desulfated derivative (B). Chemical shifts are relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm for 1H and methanol for 13C. The spin systems were denoted as A and B for 2-sulfated and non-sulfated β-galactopyranosyl units, respectively. Spectra were recorded at 50 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Correlation peaks in the two-dimensional COSY (Figs. 4, A and D) and TOCSY spectra (Figs. 4, B and E) allowed us to trace the entire spin systems of A and B signals in the native sulfated galactan and of B signal in the desulfated derivative. The COSY spectrum of the native sulfated galactan showed two correlation signals (A1–2 and B1–2) because of scalar-couplings between 1H-anomeric proton and H2 for both residues (Fig. 4A). A single B1–2 correlation signal is observed in the spectrum of the desulfated derivative (Fig. 4D). After identification of the cross-peaks in the COSY spectra, the TOCSY experiments (Figs. 4, B and E) allowed up to assign unequivocally the whole spin systems A and B and to obtain the 1H chemical shifts, as indicated in Table 1. Based on the 1H chemical shifts, we assigned the peaks of correlation in the 13C,1H HSQC spectra (Fig. 3) and obtained the values of 13C chemical shifts shown in Table 1. Analysis of these 13C chemical shifts revealed that the galactan contains 3-linked β-galactopyranosyl residues, as indicated by the typical low-field shift of carbon (∼10 ppm) in sites of glycosylation (Table 1). This 13C shift was also seen in reference compounds (Table 1).TABLE 11H and 13C chemical shifts (ppm) of the sulfated and desulfated β-d-galactan from G. crenularis and standard compoundsPolysaccharideStructure1H and 13C chemical shiftaChemical shifts are relative to external trimethylsilylpropionic acid at 0 ppm for 1H and methanol for 13C.

https://openalex.org/W2038396556,"Despite the widespread application of RNA interference (RNAi) as a research tool for diverse purposes, the key step of strand selection of siRNAs during the formation of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) remains poorly understood. Here, using siRNAs targeted to the complementary region of Survivin and the effector protease receptor 1 (EPR-1), we show that both strands of the siRNA duplex can find their target mRNA and are equally eligible for assembly into Argonaute 2 (Ago2) of RISC in HEK293 cells. Transfection of the synthetic siRNA duplexes with different thermodynamic profiles or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors that generate double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), permitting processing specifically from either the 5' or 3' end of the incipient siRNA, results in the degradation of the respective target mRNAs of either strand of the siRNA duplex with comparable efficiencies. Thus, while most RNAi reactions may follow the thermodynamic asymmetry rule in strand selection, our study suggests an exceptional mode for certain siRNAs in which both strands of the duplex are competent in sponsoring RNAi, and implies additional factors that might dictate the RNAi targets."
https://openalex.org/W2023665029,"Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitously expressed calcium sensor that engages in regulatory interactions with a large number of cellular proteins. Previously, a unique mode of CaM target recognition has been observed in the crystal structure of a complex between CaM and the CaM-binding domain of calcineurin A.We have solved a high-resolution crystal structure of a complex between CaM and the CaM-binding domain of calcineurin A in a novel crystal form, which shows a dimeric assembly of calmodulin, as observed before in the crystal state. We note that the conformation of CaM in this complex is very similar to that of unliganded CaM, and a detailed analysis revels that the CaM-binding motif in calcineurin A is of a novel '1-11' type. However, using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that the complex is fully monomeric in solution, and a structure of a canonically collapsed CaM-peptide complex can easily be fitted into the SAXS data. This result is also supported by size exclusion chromatography, where the addition of the ligand peptide decreases the apparent size of CaM. In addition, we studied the energetics of binding by isothermal titration calorimetry and found them to closely resemble those observed previously for ligand peptides from CaM-dependent kinases.Our results implicate that CaM can also form a complex with the CaM-binding domain of calcineurin in a 1 ratio 1 stoichiometry, in addition to the previously observed 2 ratio 2 arrangement in the crystal state. At the structural level, going from 2 ratio 2 association to two 1 ratio 1 complexes will require domain swapping in CaM, accompanied by the characteristic bending of the central linker helix between the two lobes of CaM."
https://openalex.org/W2149601154,"Background D-alanylated lipoteichoic acid is a virtually ubiquitous component of Gram-positive cell walls. Mutations in the dltABCD operon of numerous species exhibit pleiotropic effects, including reduced virulence, which has been attributed to increased binding of cationic antimicrobial peptides to the more negatively charged cell surface. In this study, we have further investigated the effects that mutating dltA has on virulence factor expression in Streptococcus pyogenes. Methodology/Principal Findings Isogenic ΔdltA mutants had previously been created in two distinct M1T1 isolates of S. pyogenes. Immunoblots, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence were used to quantitate M protein levels in these strains, as well as to assess their ability to bind complement. Bacteria were tested for their ability to interact with human PMN and to grow in whole human blood. Message levels for emm, sic, and various regulatory elements were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Cell walls of ΔdltA mutants contained much less M protein than cell walls of parent strains and this correlated with reduced levels of emm transcripts, increased deposition of complement, increased association of bacteria with polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and reduced bacterial growth in whole human blood. Transcription of at least one other gene of the mga regulon, sic, which encodes a protein that inactivates antimicrobial peptides, was also dramatically reduced in ΔdltA mutants. Concomitantly, ccpA and rofA were unaffected, while rgg and arcA were up-regulated. Conclusions/Significance This study has identified a novel mechanism for the reduced virulence of dltA mutants of Streptococcus pyogenes in which gene regulatory networks somehow sense and respond to the loss of DltA and lack of D-alanine esterification of lipoteichoic acid. The mechanism remains to be determined, but the data indicate that the status of D-alanine-lipoteichoic acid can significantly influence the expression of at least some streptococcal virulence factors and provide further impetus to targeting the dlt operon of Gram-positive pathogens in the search for novel antimicrobial compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2019068104,"Background Elemental imbalances of carbon (C): nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) ratios in food resources can constrain the growth of grazers owning to tight coupling between growth rate, RNA allocation and biomass P content in animals. Testing for stoichiometric constraints among invasive species is a novel challenge in invasion ecology to unravel how a successful invader tackles ecological barriers in novel ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the C∶P and N∶P ratios and the condition factor of a successful invader in lakes, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), collected from two Swedish lakes. Concurrently, we analyzed the elemental composition of the food (seston) and tissue of the mussels in which nutrient composition of food and mussels varied over time. Zebra mussel condition factor was weakly related to the their own tissue N∶P and C∶P ratios, although the relation with the later ratio was not significant. Smaller mussels had relatively lower tissue N∶P ratio and higher condition factor. There was no difference in C∶P and N∶P ratios between seston and mussels' tissues. Our results indicated that the variation in nutrient stoichiometry of zebra mussels can be explained by food quality and quantity. Conclusions/Significance Our study suggests that fitness of invasive zebra mussels is not constrained by nutrient stoichiometry which is likely to be important for their proliferation in novel ecosystems. The lack of imbalance in C∶P and N∶P ratios between seston and mussels along with high tissue C∶P ratio of the mussel allow them to tolerate potential P limitation and maintain high growth rate. Moreover, zebra mussels are able to change their tissue C∶P and N∶P ratios in response to the variation in elemental composition of their food. This can also help them to bypass potential nutrient stoichiometric constraints. Our finding is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms contributing to the success of exotic species from stoichiometric principles."
https://openalex.org/W2134897594,"Corynebacterium glutamicum cgR_1435 (cg1552) encodes a protein of the DUF24 protein family, which is a novel family of transcriptional regulators. CgR1435 (QorR) is a negative regulator of cgR_1436 (qor2), which is located upstream of cgR_1435 (qorR) in the opposite orientation, and its structural gene. QorR binds to the intergenic region between qor2 and qorR to repress their expression, which is induced by the thiol-specific oxidant diamide. The DNA-binding activity of QorR is impaired by oxidants such as diamide, H(2)O(2), and cumene hydroperoxide in vitro, and its lone cysteine residue (Cys-17) is essential for redox-responsive regulation of QorR activity both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, a disruptant of qor2, which is a homologue of the ytfG gene of Escherichia coli encoding quinone oxidoreductase, shows increased sensitivity to diamide. It is concluded that the redox-sensing transcriptional regulator QorR is involved in disulfide stress response of C. glutamicum by regulating qor2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1996734830,"BBK32 is a surface expressed lipoprotein and fibronectin (Fn)-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecule (MSCRAMM) of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Previous studies from our group showed that BBK32 is a virulence factor in experimental Lyme disease and located the Fn-binding region to residues 21-205 of the lipoprotein.Studies aimed at identifying interacting sites between BBK32 and Fn revealed an interaction between the MSCRAMM and the Fn F3 modules. Further analysis of this interaction showed that BBK32 can cause the aggregation of human plasma Fn in a similar concentration-dependent manner to that of anastellin, the superfibronectin (sFn) inducing agent. The resulting Fn aggregates are conformationally distinct from plasma Fn as indicated by a change in available thermolysin cleavage sites. Recombinant BBK32 and anastellin affect the structure of Fn matrices formed by cultured fibroblasts and inhibit endothelial cell proliferation similarly. Within BBK32, we have located the sFn-forming activity to a region between residues 160 and 175 which contains two sequence motifs that are also found in anastellin. Synthetic peptides mimicking these motifs induce Fn aggregation, whereas a peptide with a scrambled sequence motif was inactive, suggesting that these motifs represent the sFn-inducing sequence.We conclude that BBK32 induces the formation of Fn aggregates that are indistinguishable from those formed by anastellin. The results of this study provide evidence for how bacteria can target host proteins to manipulate host cell activities."

This study was conducted in order to investigate whether these genetic markers are associated with Japanese CNS hypersomnias (essential hypersomnia: EHS) other than narcolepsy with cataplexy. Principal Findings EHS was significantly associated with SNP rs5770917 (Pallele = 3.6×10−3; OR = 1.56; 95% c.i.: 1.12–2.15) and HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotype (Ppositivity = 9.2×10−11; OR = 3.97; 95% c.i.: 2.55–6.19). No interaction between the two markers (SNP rs5770917 and HLA-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 haplotype) was observed in EHS.

https://openalex.org/W2149570618,"Bacterial persistent infections are responsible for a significant amount of the human morbidity and mortality. Unlike acute bacterial infections, it is very difficult to treat persistent bacterial infections (e.g. tuberculosis). Knowledge about the location of pathogenic bacteria during persistent infection will help to treat such conditions by designing novel drugs which can reach such locations. In this study, events of bacterial persistent infections were analyzed using game theory. A game was defined where the pathogen and the host are the two players with a conflict of interest. Criteria for the establishment of Nash equilibrium were calculated for this game. This theoretical model, which is very simple and heuristic, predicts that during persistent infections pathogenic bacteria stay in both intracellular and extracellular compartments of the host. The result of this study implies that a bacterium should be able to survive in both intracellular and extracellular compartments of the host in order to cause persistent infections. This explains why persistent infections are more often caused by intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium and Salmonella. Moreover, this prediction is in consistence with the results of previous experimental studies."
https://openalex.org/W1972491437,"Echinococcosis is a worldwide zoonotic parasitic disease of humans and various herbivorous domestic animals (intermediate hosts) transmitted by the contact with wild and domestic carnivores (definitive hosts), mainly foxes and dogs. Recently, a vaccine was developed showing high levels of protection against one parasite haplotype (G1) of Echinococcus granulosus, and its potential efficacy against distinct parasite variants or species is still unclear. Interestingly, the EG95 vaccine antigen is a secreted glycosylphosphatydilinositol (GPI)-anchored protein containing a fibronectin type III domain, which is ubiquitous in modular proteins involved in cell adhesion. EG95 is highly expressed in oncospheres, the parasite life cycle stage which actively invades the intermediate hosts. After amplifying and sequencing the complete CDS of 57 Echinococcus isolates belonging to 7 distinct species, we uncovered a large amount of genetic variability, which may influence protein folding. Two positively selected sites are outside the vaccine epitopes, but are predicted to alter protein conformation. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses indicate that EG95 isoform evolution is convergent with regard to the number of beta-sheets and alpha-helices. We conclude that having a variety of EG95 isoforms is adaptive for Echinococcus parasites, in terms of their ability to invade different hosts, and we propose that a mixture of isoforms could possibly maximize vaccine efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1980764075,"Whether and how cold causes changes in cell-membrane or lipid rafts remain poorly characterized. Using the NSOM/QD and confocal imaging systems, we found that cold caused microscale redistribution of lipid raft markers, GM1 for lipid and CD59 for protein, from the peripheral part of microdomains to the central part on Jurkat T cells, and that cold also induced the nanoscale size-enlargement (1/3- to 2/3-fold) of the nanoclusters of lipid raft markers and even the colocalization of GM1 and CD59 nanoclusters. These findings indicate cold-induced lateral rearrangement/coalescence of raft-related membrane heterogeneity. The cold-induced re-distribution of lipid raft markers under a nearly-natural condition provide clues for their alternations, and help to propose a model in which raft lipids associate themselves or interact with protein components to generate functional membrane heterogeneity in response to stimulus. The data also underscore the possible cold-induced artifacts in early-described cold-related experiments and the detergent-resistance-based analyses of lipid rafts at 4 degrees C, and provide a biophysical explanation for recently-reported cold-induced activation of signaling pathways in T cells. Importantly, our fluorescence-topographic NSOM imaging demonstrated that GM1/CD59 raft markers distributed and re-distributed at mounds but not depressions of T-cell membrane fluctuations. Such mound-top distribution of lipid raft markers or lipid rafts provides spatial advantage for lipid rafts or contact molecules interacting readily with neighboring cells or free molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2080337855,"Adult Upis ceramboides do not survive freezing in the summer but tolerate freezing to −60 °C in midwinter. The accumulation of two cryoprotective polyols, sorbitol and threitol, is integral to the extraordinary cold-hardiness of this beetle. U. ceramboides are the only animals known to accumulate high concentrations of threitol; however, the biosynthetic pathway has not been studied. A series of 13C-labeled compounds was employed to investigate this biosynthetic pathway using 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy. In vivo metabolism of 13C-labeled glucose isotopomers demonstrates that C-3—C-6 of glucose become C-1—C-4 of threitol. This labeling pattern is expected for 4-carbon saccharides arising from the pentose phosphate pathway. In vitro experiments show that threitol is synthesized from erythrose 4-phosphate, a C4 intermediate in the PPP. Erythrose 4-phosphate is epimerized and/or isomerized to threose 4-phosphate, which is subsequently reduced by a NADPH-dependent polyol dehydrogenase and dephosphorylated by a sugar phosphatase to form threitol. Threitol 4-phosphate appears to be the preferred substrate of the sugar phosphatase(s), promoting threitol synthesis over that of erythritol. In contrast, the NADPH-dependent polyol dehydrogenase exhibits broad substrate specificity. Efficient erythritol catabolism under conditions that promote threitol synthesis, coupled with preferential threitol biosynthesis, appear to be responsible for the accumulation of high concentrations of threitol (250 mm) without concomitant accumulation of erythritol. Adult Upis ceramboides do not survive freezing in the summer but tolerate freezing to −60 °C in midwinter. The accumulation of two cryoprotective polyols, sorbitol and threitol, is integral to the extraordinary cold-hardiness of this beetle.

A series of 13C-labeled compounds was employed to investigate this biosynthetic pathway using 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy. In vivo metabolism of 13C-labeled glucose isotopomers demonstrates that C-3—C-6 of glucose become C-1—C-4 of threitol. This labeling pattern is expected for 4-carbon saccharides arising from the pentose phosphate pathway. In vitro experiments show that threitol is synthesized from erythrose 4-phosphate, a C4 intermediate in the PPP. Erythrose 4-phosphate is epimerized and/or isomerized to threose 4-phosphate, which is subsequently reduced by a NADPH-dependent polyol dehydrogenase and dephosphorylated by a sugar phosphatase to form threitol. Threitol 4-phosphate appears to be the preferred substrate of the sugar phosphatase(s), promoting threitol synthesis over that of erythritol. In contrast, the NADPH-dependent polyol dehydrogenase exhibits broad substrate specificity. Efficient erythritol catabolism under conditions that promote threitol synthesis, coupled with preferential threitol biosynthesis, appear to be responsible for the accumulation of high concentrations of threitol (250 mm) without concomitant accumulation of erythritol. Cold-hardy terrestrial insects from temperate to arctic regions exhibit two physiological strategies to survive subzero temperatures: freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance (1Lee R.E. Lee R. Denlinger D. Insects at Low Temperature. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 17-46Crossref Google Scholar, 2Block W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 613-633Crossref Google Scholar, 3Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 27-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Freeze-tolerant organisms survive ice in their extracellular fluids but are generally susceptible to intracellular freezing (3Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 27-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Freeze-avoiding insects do not survive freezing of their body fluids and typically supercool beyond the lowest environmental temperature they are likely to experience in nature (4Duman J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 327-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Both freeze-tolerant and freeze-avoiding insects commonly produce polyols, also known as alditols, to mitigate the effects of low temperature (5Zachariassen K.E. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 799-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Polyols are biocompatible solutes that lack toxicity, even at molar concentrations, and stabilize native protein structure at low temperature (6Storey K.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 635-654Crossref Google Scholar). However, the functions of polyols depend on the overwintering strategy. In freeze-tolerant organisms, polyols reduce the fraction of frozen water, thereby preventing excessive intracellular dehydration. In contrast, polyols promote supercooling in freeze-avoiding organisms (5Zachariassen K.E. Physiol. Rev. 1985; 65: 799-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Glycerol is the most commonly accumulated polyol in both freeze-tolerant and freeze-avoiding insects. However, overwintering insects are taxonomically diverse and produce various polyols in response to low temperature, including ethylene glycol, erythritol, mannitol, ribitol, sorbitol, and threitol (6Storey K.B. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 635-654Crossref Google Scholar). The accumulation of sorbitol and threitol in the hemolymph of the freeze-tolerant beetle, Upis ceramboides, is associated with increasing cold tolerance (7Miller L.K. J. Insect Physiol. 1978; 24: 791-796Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the summer, when neither sorbitol nor threitol are detectable in the hemolymph, U. ceramboides do not survive freezing. As sorbitol and threitol accumulate in the hemolymph, there is a concomitant decrease in lethal temperature to −60 °C (8Miller L.K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1982; 73: 595-604Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Polyols are typically produced in the fat body by the actions of two enzymes, a NADPH-dependent polyol dehydrogenase and a sugar phosphatase, on a sugar phosphate (e.g. glucose 6-phosphate) in constitutive metabolic pathways such as glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) 2The abbreviations used are: PPPpentose phosphate pathway13C{1H}NMRproton-decoupled carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyE4Perythrose 4-phosphateEu4Perythrulose 4-phosphateDHAP[1-13C]dihydroxyacetone phosphateT4Pthreose 4-phosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: PPPpentose phosphate pathway13C{1H}NMRproton-decoupled carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyE4Perythrose 4-phosphateEu4Perythrulose 4-phosphateDHAP[1-13C]dihydroxyacetone phosphateT4Pthreose 4-phosphate. (9Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Lee R. Denlinger D. Insects at Low Temperature. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 64-93Crossref Google Scholar). However, threitol biosynthesis does not fit this pattern because T4P, the putative metabolic precursor of threitol, is not observed in normal constitutive metabolism. Threitol is a biologically rare compound, and U. ceramboides are the only organisms known to accumulate it at high concentrations (∼250 mm) (7Miller L.K. J. Insect Physiol. 1978; 24: 791-796Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 10Miller L.K. Smith J.S. Nature. 1975; 258: 519-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although low concentrations (≤2 μg/mg fresh mass or ∼3 mm) have been reported in the overwintering spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (11Kostál V.

The threitol biosynthetic pathway has not been fully characterized in any organism. In humans, threitol is the major end product of xylose catabolism and is thought to be produced via the glucuronate pathway (12Pitkänen E. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 80: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, xylans, containing predominantly β-(1→4)-linked xylose, are the major saccharide component of hemicellulose in plants (13Prade R.A. Biotechnol. Genet. Eng. Rev. 1996; 13: 101-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thus, the wood-decomposing U. ceramboides have a potential dietary source of xylose, which could serve as the metabolic precursor of threitol. Despite the absence of experimental evidence, it has been assumed that threitol production in insects involves the PPP. In addition to being a source of 4-carbon monosaccharides, flux through the PPP generates the reducing equivalents (NADPH) needed for polyol biosynthesis (9Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Lee R. Denlinger D. Insects at Low Temperature. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 64-93Crossref Google Scholar). However, the broad specificities observed for polyol dehydrogenases (14Chino H. J. Insect Physiol. 1960; 5: 1-15Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Takahashi S.Y. Kajiura T. Kageyama T. Ohnishi E. Insect Biochem. 1974; 4: 33-45Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and sugar phosphatases (16Chino H. J. Insect Physiol. 1961; 6: 231-240Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Kageyama T. Takahashi S.Y. Ohnishi E. Insect Biochem. 1973; 3: 373-388Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) lead to the question of how high concentrations of threitol arise from the PPP without the accumulation of other C4 and C5 alditols. Indeed, the ability of various insect species to accumulate high concentrations of a single C4 or C5 alditol originating from the PPP has not been investigated (9Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Lee R. Denlinger D. Insects at Low Temperature. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 64-93Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, the threitol biosynthetic pathway in U. ceramboides has been investigated by 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy using 13C-labeled metabolites. The results elucidate the threitol biosynthetic pathway and lead to a new metabolic model that explains the observed selective accumulation of threitol. Adult U. ceramboides were collected in early to midwinter from near Fairbanks, Alaska. Insects were shipped overnight on cold packs, frozen at −20 °C, to the University of Notre Dame. If necessary, the insects were stored at −20 °C in darkness for up to 3 weeks to mimic the winter conditions in Fairbanks. Insects typically regained coordinated movement within 1 h of thawing at 15 °C. To reduce endogenous polyols to undetectable levels, all winter-collected insects were deacclimated for 4 days at 15 °C on a short photoperiod (4 h light/20 h dark) and stored at 4 °C for at least 3 days prior to experimental use. In contrast to many other species of insects, U. ceramboides are able to synthesize polyols after deacclimation or during any time of year (7Miller L.K. J. Insect Physiol. 1978; 24: 791-796Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). U. ceramboides collected in mid-January (avg. mass ∼150 mg) were bled by removing the elytra and wings and applying gentle pressure to the abdomen. Hemolymph pooled at the lesions created by the removal of the elytra/wings and was drawn up into 10-μl capillary tubes, typically ∼10–40 μl/individual. The hemolymph was removed from the capillary tubes by centrifuging at 1000 × g and consolidated in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. 600 μl of hemolymph was combined with 60 μl of 99% 2H2O in a 5-mm NMR tube prior to NMR analysis. To monitor the metabolism of 13C-labeled saccharides, 4.5 μl of 13C-labeled aldose or alditol solution (∼330 mm for aldotetroses, otherwise 1–2 m; Omicron Biochemicals, Inc.) were injected directly into the hemolymph of a deacclimated U. ceramboides with a 5-μl Hamilton syringe. Following the injection of aldose, each beetle was acclimated at −4 °C for 7 h to 7 days to follow alditol production. In contrast, beetles injected with alditol were acclimated at 23 °C for 2–48 h to monitor the disappearance of alditol. Alternatively, alditol-injected beetles were acclimated at 4 °C for 5 days or at 0 °C for 6 days. After acclimation, the elytra and wings of each beetle were removed so that intact gut could be dissected out before homogenization. Each beetle (1–2/sample) was homogenized in 520 μl of 40 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5 at 0 °C) and sonicated with a W-385 sonicator (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc.) for two 10-s intervals at power level 3. The homogenate was subsequently heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min to inactivate enzymes. After cooling on ice, 100 μl of chloroform was added to the homogenate, and the mixture was vortexed and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and placed into a 5-mm NMR tube (Wilmad) containing 65 μl of 2H2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.). The final volume was adjusted to 650 μl with phosphate buffer, and the sample was analyzed by 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy. Polyol synthesis occurs within the insect fat body (9Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Lee R. Denlinger D. Insects at Low Temperature. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 64-93Crossref Google Scholar), the organ analogous to the vertebrate liver. However, the putative intermediate metabolites of threitol biosynthesis (E4P and T4P) are phosphorylated; thus, it was unlikely that these compounds would be transported across cell membranes. Intermediary threitol metabolism was therefore investigated in an in vitro cell-free extract of U. ceramboides. In vitro metabolism samples were prepared in individual 5-mm NMR tubes with the following stock solutions: 60 μl of the appropriate d-[1-13C]aldose 4-phosphate; 65 μl of 99% 2H2O; 10 μl each of aqueous NADH and NADPH (Sigma-Aldrich) at 7 mg/ml; 515 μl of insect homogenate (recipe follows); and 0.8 or 1.6 μl of ∼2 ml-[1-13C]glucose (Omicron Biochemicals, Inc.) for the [1-13C]E4P and [1-13C]T4P experiments, respectively. Relative signal intensities were normalized to an internal control, the C-1 signal of β-l-[1-13C]glucose. The metabolism samples were made with pooled insect homogenate to reduce variability, and each reaction was replicated twice. For background spectra, deionized water was substituted for the tetrose 4-phosphates, reducing equivalents, and l-[1-13C]glucose solutions. Immediately before addition to the NMR tubes, the pH of each [1-13C]aldose 4-phosphate solution was adjusted to 5–7 with the dropwise addition of ice-cold 1 m NaOH with efficient stirring. Ideally, the fat body should be the only tissue included in the in vitro homogenate, as it is the site of alditol synthesis. However, the fat body in U. ceramboides is not a consolidated organ and is difficult to remove. Thus, the whole body of the insect was homogenized after the gut was removed (elytra and wings also removed in the process) to prevent contamination with bacteria and/or proteolytic enzymes. The dissected beetle was placed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and homogenized using a pair of small dissecting scissors in 520 μl of ice-cold 40 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5 at 0 °C) containing the following antioxidants/protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich): 2 mg/ml glutathione, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.25 mg/ml antipain, 0.25 mg/ml chymostatin, 0.25 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.05 mg/ml pepstatin A. Following homogenization, the homogenates were maintained on ice and sonicated with a W-385 sonicator for two 10-s intervals at power level 3. After sonication, 100 μl of chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each homogenate to remove triglyceride contamination. Each homogenate was then vortexed and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The aqueous supernatants from all insects (n = 6) were pooled, diluted with additional ice-cold buffer as necessary, and vortexed before being transferring into 5-mm NMR tubes. For the heat-treated control, 515 μl of pooled homogenate was transferred into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm to remove the precipitated protein prior to addition to the NMR tube. All in vitro aldose phosphate reactions were maintained at −2.5 °C in a cooling bath over the course of 7 days. Samples were transported on ice and maintained on ice until placed into the NMR spectrometer. d-[1-13C]Aldotetrose phosphates were prepared by the addition of K13CN to d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form two C-2-epimeric aldotetrononitrile phosphates, which were separated chromatographically before reduction to the tetrose 4-phosphates (18Serianni A.S. Pierce J. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The following modifications were made to the published protocol. Over-reduction of [1-13C]erythrononitrile 4-phosphate to [1-13C]erythritol 4-phosphate was observed after 8 h of reduction (∼40% over-reduction). A corresponding over-reduction was not observed with [1-13C]threononitrile 4-phosphate until the reduction time was increased to 16 h. In both cases, the alditol phosphates were separated from the aldose phosphates during final chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 anion exchange resin in the acetate form. Elution of the alditol 4-phosphate immediately preceded that of the aldose 4-phosphate, although some overlap of the two compounds was observed. The fractions containing predominantly alditol phosphate or aldose phosphate, as determined by 13C{1H} NMR analysis, were pooled. 13C NMR analysis of the alditol phosphates yielded chemical shifts consistent with the presence of phosphate at C-4 (Table 1). The alditol phosphates were used as standards to identify the products of in vitro tetrose 4-phosphate metabolism. Organic phosphate concentrations were determined by colorimetric assay (19Leloir L.F. Cardini C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 840Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar).TABLE 113C chemical shifts of standard compounds in aqueous solution at 22 °CpHC-1C-2C-3C-4C-5C-6β-d-GlucopyranoseaValues reported in Ref.

Open table in a new tab d-[1-13C]Erythritol and d-[1-13C]threitol were prepared by reduction of the corresponding [1-13C]aldotetroses (Omicron Biochemicals, Inc.) with sodium borohydride (Sigma-Aldrich) (20Garrett E.C. Serianni A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 208: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). After workup to remove borate, the alditol samples were >95% pure as determined by NMR. 13C{1H} NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian UNITY Plus 600 MHz (150.86 MHz for 13C) NMR spectrometer equipped with a Varian probe. Data acquisition parameters were as follows: 100–1,000 transients; 3-s recycle time; 295.15 K; −15 to 230 ppm spectral window. Free induction decays were zero-filled once, and a line-broadening function (1 Hz) was applied prior to Fourier transformation to give a final digital resolution of 7.14 points/Hz. Spectra were referenced externally using a solution of d-[1-13C]mannose in 2H2O. The most intense signal in the reference spectrum, arising from C-1 of α-d-mannopyranose, was set to 95.54 ppm. Spectra were collected shortly after the addition of aldose phosphate, and after 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. Primary alcoholic carbons (-CH2OH groups) resonate over a narrow range, making chemical shift-based assignments unreliable. For instance, the chemical shifts of threitol (C-1/C-4) and threitol 4-phosphate (C-1) differed by ∼0.03 ppm, but differences in temperature and pH resulted in chemical shift values that varied by more than 0.1 ppm for threitol 4-phosphate alone. Reaction mixtures were therefore spiked with unlabeled or 13C-labeled standards to allow firm identification of the chemical species producing specific signals in the spectra (supplemental Fig. 1). In this study, both relative intensities (peak height) and relative integrals (peak area) of 13C signals were used to estimate relative concentrations. Signal intensities were compared when signal integration was not possible because signals were overlapping and could not be integrated accurately. The use of signal intensity, instead of signal area, was validated by measuring the resonance line widths at half peak height for the signals being compared. For instance, in the E4P in vitro metabolism sample after 7 days, the line widths of the four alditol signals were very similar, averaging 1.37 ± 0.10 Hz, thus allowing signal intensities to be used to determine relative concentrations. The intensity of each signal was measured from the base line to the highest point on the signal using Varian processing software. Raw intensities or areas were compared with the internal standard within a spectrum to generate relative intensities/areas, which were then compared across spectra. Differential nuclear Overhauser effects and incomplete relaxation could potentially affect the relative intensities (or areas) of the signals (21Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-66Crossref Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). However, under suitable conditions, comparison of signal intensities or areas for carbons having the same number of attached protons is a reliable method of quantitation (21Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-66Crossref Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). A comparison of the intensities of the natural abundance 13C signals of sorbitol indicated that all six signals were approximately equally intense (Fig. 1) with a standard deviation of ±7%. The two natural abundance threitol signals behaved similarly; the ratio of the intensity of the C-1/C-4 signal to that of C-2/C-3 was 1.05:1.00. In the in vitro experiments, the ratio of the signals from the α- and β-l-glucose anomers served as an internal control, giving similar relative intensities between experiments. The ratio of the intensity of the α to β anomers for different samples during the course of the experiment was 0.45 ± 0.03:1 ± S.D. (n = 13). These results indicate that the error associated with using signal intensities to estimate saccharide concentration is ±7%. 13C NMR analysis of the hemolymph from winter-acclimatized U. ceramboides confirmed that sorbitol and threitol are the predominant polyols (Fig. 1). In addition, weaker signals attributed to proline, trehalose, betaine-like compounds, erythritol, ribitol, and ethylene glycol were detected (Fig. 2). Signals assigned tentatively to erythritol and ribitol, expected by-products of threitol biosynthesis via the PPP, were confirmed by spiking the hemolymph with authentic alditols and observing the resulting enhanced signal intensities in the spectrum (Fig. 2). The relative signal intensities of both alditols provided further support for the assignments. The intensities of both erythritol 13C signals, each representing two carbon nuclei (Table 1), were approximately equal, whereas for ribitol the intensity of the C-3 signal was one-half that of the remaining two ribitol signals (Table 1), which arise from magnetically equivalent C-2/C-4 and C-1/C-5 pairs. Glycerol, the most commonly produced polyol in cold-hardy insects, was not observed in the winter hemolymph of U. ceramboides (Fig. 2). In other insect species, alditols are reported to freely penetrate cell membranes (9Storey K.B. Storey J.M. Lee R. Denlinger D. Insects at Low Temperature. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 64-93Crossref Google Scholar). In U. ceramboides, alditols observed in the hemolymph were qualitatively identical to those observed in the homogenate from the same beetle. (The hemocoel was rinsed with buffer to remove residual hemolymph polyols.) Furthermore, the relative proportions of polyols were very similar in both the hemolymph and the homogenate, suggesting that alditols penetrate cell membranes freely. Insects were homogenized in the in vivo experiments to increase the concentration of 13C nuclei in the NMR sample, which aided in detection of the labeled saccharides and increased the accuracy of quantification (21Bock K. Pedersen C. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-66Crossref Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Changes in the relative distribution of isotopic enrichment over time (Fig. 3) provided insights into the metabolism of 13C-labeled glucose. Labeled glucose was rapidly metabolized at −4 °C; within 7 h, 20 ± 8% (n = 3) of the labeled glucose was reduced to correspondingly labeled sorbitol (Fig. 3A). Conversion to sorbitol accounted for >95% of the reduction in labeled glucose signal, although a low level of isotopic enrichment of trehalose was observed. Other alditols observed in the winter hemolymph of U. ceramboides, including threitol, were not detected. After 24 h, labeled glucose comprised ∼20% of the total 13C-enriched signals, suggesting that ∼80% of the glucose had been converted to other metabolites (Fig. 3A), of which sorbitol comprised ∼90%. The remaining 10% of 13C-enriched compounds consisted of trehalose, threitol, erythritol, and ethylene glycol. After 1 week (168 h) at −4 °C, very little residual labeled glucose was detected (∼1.5% of the total 13C signal), and sorbitol, trehalose, threitol, erythritol, and ethylene glycol were observed to be isotopically labeled (Fig. 3, B and C). The total integral of the 13C-enriched signals relative to natural abundance trehalose signals did not attenuate noticeably over time, suggesting that most of the 13C-labeled glucose was converted to the observed saccharides. To evaluate the potential contributions of both the PPP and xylose-glucuronate pathways (supplemental Fig. 2) to threitol biosynthesis, we monitored the metabolism of 13C-labeled xylose and glucose. d-[2-13C]Xylose was reduced predominantly to d-[2-13C]xylitol after 48 h at −4 °C, although low levels of 13C enrichment were also detected for threitol. The intensity of the C-1/C-4 threitol signal was enriched ∼2.2-fold over that of the C-2/C-3 signal, suggesting that a small amount of xylose was converted to threitol possibly though the glucuronate pathway. In contrast to d-xylose, d-glucose was converted primarily sorbitol (Fig. 3), not xylitol. As observed for xylose metabolism, small quantities of glucose were converted to saccharides other than the primary alditol product, including threitol. It was observed that threitol comprised a significantly larger percentage of the 13C pool, 6.1 ± 2.5% (p < 0.0421, students t test, n = 10), when C-3—C-6 of glucose was 13C-labeled compared with when C-1—C-2 (1.1 ± 0.3%) was labeled (Fig. 3, B and C). These results show that threitol was generated from the bottom four carbons of d-glucose via the PPP (e.g. d-[3-13C]glucose yields d-[1-13C]threitol) (supplemental Fig. 2). The isotopic enrichment pattern of threitol resulting from the various singly labeled glucose isotopomers supports this argument because in every case the predicted site of 13C enrichment was at least 5-fold greater than the remaining threitol signal (Table 2). Injection of [1-13C] and [2-13C]glucose led to a 1.5–2-fold enrichment of one threitol signal relative to the remaining signal (Table 2). One possible explanation for this enrichment is that label scrambling might arise from combined actions of glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes. To investigate this possibility, we compared the intensity of the expected site of secondary enrichment for sorbitol to the intensities of the remaining four natural abundance sorbitol signals, revealing that this site was enhanced ∼1.8-fold.TABLE 2Isotopic enrichment of threitol and sorbitol observed after injections of singly 13C-labeled glucose isotopomers into the hemolymph of U. ceramboides13C-Labeled carbon in glucosePredicted position of 13C enrichment in threitolRatio of threitol 13C signal intensities C-1/C-4:C-2/C-3Predicted position of secondary 13C enrichmentaSecondary enrichment of sorbitol due to label"
https://openalex.org/W2083688033,"Helicobacter spp. represent a proportionately small but significant component of the normal intestinal microflora of animal hosts. Several of these intestinal Helicobacter spp. are known to induce colitis in mouse models, yet the mechanisms by which these bacteria induce intestinal inflammation are poorly understood. To address this question, we performed in vitro co-culture experiments with mouse and human epithelial cell lines stimulated with a selection of Helicobacter spp., including known pathogenic species as well as ones for which the pathogenic potential is less clear. Strikingly, a member of the normal microflora of rodents, Helicobacter muridarum, was found to be a particularly strong inducer of CXC chemokine (Cxcl1/KC, Cxcl2/MIP-2) responses in a murine intestinal epithelial cell line. Time-course studies revealed a biphasic pattern of chemokine responses in these cells, with H. muridarum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediating early (24-48 h) responses and live bacteria seeming to provoke later (48-72 h) responses. H. muridarum LPS per se was shown to induce CXC chemokine production in HEK293 cells stably expressing Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but not in those expressing TLR4. In contrast, live H. muridarum bacteria were able to induce NF-kappaB reporter activity and CXC chemokine responses in TLR2-deficient HEK293 and in AGS epithelial cells. These responses were attenuated by transient transfection with a dominant negative construct to NOD1, and by stable expression of NOD1 siRNA, respectively. Thus, the data suggest that both TLR2 and NOD1 may be involved in innate immune sensing of H. muridarum by epithelial cells. This work identifies H. muridarum as a commensal bacterium with pathogenic potential and underscores the potential roles of ill-defined members of the normal flora in the initiation of inflammation in animal hosts. We suggest that H. muridarum may act as a confounding factor in colitis model studies in rodents."
https://openalex.org/W2080781145,"Orientation selectivity of primary visual cortical neurons is an important requisite for shape perception. Although numerous studies have been previously devoted to a question of how orientation selectivity is established and elaborated in early life, how the susceptibility of orientation plasticity to visual experience changes in time remains unclear. In the present study, we showed a postnatal sensitive period profile for the modifiability of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex of kittens reared with head-mounted goggles for stable single-orientation exposure. When goggle rearing (GR) started at P16-P30, 2 weeks of GR induced a marked over-representation of the exposed orientation, and 2 more weeks of GR consolidated the altered orientation maps. GR that started later than P50, in turn, induced the under-representation of the exposed orientation. Orientation plasticity in the most sensitive period was markedly suppressed by cortical infusion of NMDAR antagonist. The present study reveals that the plasticity and consolidation of orientation selectivity in an early life are dynamically regulated in an experience-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2061869447,"Genetic toggle switches are widespread in gene regulatory networks (GRN). Bistability, namely the ability to choose among two different stable states, is an essential feature of switching and memory devices. Cells have many regulatory circuits able to provide bistability that endow a cell with efficient and reliable switching between different physiological modes of operation. It is often assumed that negative feedbacks with cooperative binding (i.e. the formation of dimers or multimers) are a prerequisite for bistability. Here we analyze the relation between bistability in GRN under monomeric regulation and the role of autoloops under a deterministic setting. Using a simple geometric argument, we show analytically that bistability can also emerge without multimeric regulation, provided that at least one regulatory autoloop is present."
https://openalex.org/W1984954275,"Differential inhibitors of Gbetagamma-effector regions are required to dissect the biological contribution of specific Gbetagamma-initiated signaling pathways. Here, we characterize PhLP-M1-G149, a Gbetagamma-interacting construct derived from phosducin-like protein 1 (PhLP) as a differential inhibitor of Gbetagamma, which, in endothelial cells, prevented sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced phosphorylation of AKT, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, cell migration, and tubulogenesis, while having no effect on ERK phosphorylation or hepatocyte growth factor-dependent responses. This construct attenuated the recruitment of phosphoinositide 3-kinase gamma (PI3Kgamma) to the plasma membrane and the signaling to AKT in response to Gbetagamma overexpression. In coimmunoprecipitation experiments, PhLP-M1-G149 interfered with the interaction between PI3Kgamma and Gbetagamma. Other PhLP-derived constructs interacted with Gbetagamma but were not effective inhibitors of Gbetagamma signaling to AKT or ERK. Our results indicate that PhLP-M1-G149 is a suitable tool to differentially modulate the Gbetagamma-initiated pathway linking this heterodimer to AKT, endothelial cell migration, and in vitro angiogenesis. It can be also useful to further characterize the molecular determinants of the Gbetagamma-PI3Kgamma interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2063862041,"Coat-color proportions and patterns in mice are used as assays for many processes such as transgene expression, chimerism, and epigenetics. In many studies, coat-color readouts are estimated from subjective scoring of individual mice. Here we show a method by which mouse coat color is quantified as the proportion of coat shown in one or more digital images. We use the yellow-agouti mouse model of epigenetic variegation to demonstrate this method. We apply this method to live mice using a conventional digital camera for data collection. We use a raster graphics editing program to convert agouti regions of the coat to a standard, uniform, brown color and the yellow regions of the coat to a standard, uniform, yellow color. We use a second program to quantify the proportions of these standard colors. This method provides quantification that relates directly to the visual appearance of the live animal. It also provides an objective analysis with a traceable record, and it should allow for precise comparisons of mouse coats and mouse cohorts within and between studies."
https://openalex.org/W2151954452,"Transcriptional isoforms are not just random combinations of exons. What has caused exons to be differentially spliced and whether exons with different splicing frequencies are subjected to divergent regulation by potential elements or splicing signals? Beyond the conventional classification for alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) and constitutively spliced exons (CSEs), we have classified exons from alternatively spliced human genes and their mouse orthologs (12,314 and 5,464, respectively) into four types based on their splicing frequencies. Analysis has indicated that different groups of exons presented divergent compositional and regulatory properties. Interestingly, with the decrease of splicing frequency, exons tend to have greater lengths, higher GC content, and contain more splicing elements and repetitive elements, which seem to imply that the splicing frequency is influenced by such factors. Comparison of non-alternatively spliced (NAS) mouse genes with alternatively spliced human orthologs also suggested that exons with lower splicing frequencies may be newly evolved ones which gained functions with splicing frequencies altered through the evolution. Our findings have revealed for the first time that certain factors may have critical influence on the splicing frequency, suggesting that exons with lower splicing frequencies may originate from old repetitive sequences, with splicing sites altered by mutation, gaining novel functions and become more frequently spliced."
https://openalex.org/W2029946280,"The human Y chromosome carries four human Y-chromosomal euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions, all of which are characterized by the presence of interchromosomal segmental duplications. The Yq11.1/Yq11.21 transition region harbours a peculiar segment composed of an imperfectly organized tandem-repeat structure encoding four members of the double homeobox (DUX) gene family. By comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis we have documented the primary appearance of Y-chromosomal DUX genes (DUXY) on the gibbon Y chromosome. The major amplification and dispersal of DUXY paralogs occurred after the gibbon and hominid lineages had diverged. Orthologous DUXY loci of human and chimpanzee show a highly similar structural organization. Sequence alignment survey, phylogenetic reconstruction and recombination detection analyses of human and chimpanzee DUXY genes revealed the existence of all copies in a common ancestor. Comparative analysis of the circumjacent beta-satellites indicated that DUXY genes and beta-satellites evolved in concert. However, evolutionary forces acting on DUXY genes may have induced amino acid sequence differences in the orthologous chimpanzee and human DUXY open reading frames (ORFs). The acquisition of complete ORFs in human copies might relate to evolutionary advantageous functions indicating neo-functionalization. We propose an evolutionary scenario in which an ancestral tandem array DUX gene cassette transposed to the hominoid Y chromosome followed by lineage-specific chromosomal rearrangements paved the way for a species-specific evolution of the Y-chromosomal members of a large highly diverged homeobox gene family."
https://openalex.org/W2080041510,"Previously, we introduced causal mapping (CMAP) as an easy to use systems biology tool for studying the behavior of biological processes that occur at the cellular and molecular level. CMAP is a coarse-grained graphical modeling approach in which the system of interest is modeled as an interaction map between functional elements of the system, in a manner similar to portrayals of signaling pathways commonly used by molecular cell biologists. CMAP describes details of the interactions while maintaining the simplicity of other qualitative methods (e.g., Boolean networks).In this paper, we use the CMAP methodology as a tool for generating hypotheses about the mechanisms that regulate molecular and cellular systems. Furthermore, our approach allows competing hypotheses to be ranked according to a fitness index and suggests experimental tests to distinguish competing high fitness hypotheses. To motivate the CMAP as a hypotheses generating tool and demonstrate the methodology, we first apply this protocol to a simple test-case of a three-element signaling module. Our methods are next applied to the more complex phenomenon of cortical oscillations observed in spreading cells. This analysis produces two high fitness hypotheses for the mechanism that underlies this dynamic behavior and suggests experiments to distinguish the hypotheses. The method can be widely applied to other cellular systems to generate and compare alternative hypotheses based on experimentally observed data and using computer simulations."
